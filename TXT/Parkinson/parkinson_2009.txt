    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are two common neurodegenerative diseases that result in the progressive damage or death of neurons. Environmental agents have the potential to damage the developing and mature nervous system, resulting in neurodegenerative diseases. Heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve coding sequence modifications are referred to as 'epigenetic'. These modifications include DNA methylation and downstream modification of histones. Environmental factors, including heavy metals and dietary folate intake, perturb neurodegenerative genes by epigenetic means, leading to altered gene expression and late-onset neurodegenerative diseases. Research into the genetic control of DNA methylation indicates an allelic skewing in a significant proportion of genes. This phenomenon may determine how an individual's genetic makeup can alter the effect an environmental factor has on their risk of developing neurodegeneration. Finally, preliminary evidence using cell culture and transgenic animal models suggests that whole classes of pan-epigenetic modifiers will have significant protective effects against common neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease were suspected by Brissaud in the late 19th century. They were subsequently confirmed by Tretiakoff but neglected by Lewy, who described the inclusion bodies that bear his name. The experimental Parkinsonian syndrome caused by reserpine led Carlsson to discover the neuromediatory role of dopamine, a finding at the origin of L-DOPA therapy. Identification of a mutation of the alpha-synuclein gene in cases of familial Parkinson's disease with autosomal dominant transmission was followed by the detection of the protein product in Lewy bodies and neurites. Alpha-synuclein is now recognized as being the main constituent of Lewy bodies. Alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry has revealed that lesions can extend from the autonomous nervous system to the cortex (in Lewy body dementia). The Lewy body itself does not appear to be the direct cause of symptoms, which correlate better with neuronal death. Neuronal death could be due to metabolic disturbances related to alpha-synuclein accumulation, ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunction, or oxidative stress. Non-autonomous cell death, caused by neuro-inflammation or gliosis, has also been incriminated.",

    "abstract": "We compared the role of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in the management of medically refractory idiopathic Parkinson's disease in patients with relatively young onset (<40 years of age) Parkinson's disease (YOPD) and patients with relatively late onset Parkinson's disease (\u2265 56 years of age, rLOPD).\nA total of 33 patients with YOPD (18 patients, median age 32.5 years, range, 20-40 years) and rLOPD (15 patients, median age 58.0 years, range, 56.0-67.0 years) underwent STN-DBS between May 2000 and May 2008. We divided the patients into YOPD and rLOPD as the age of disease onset. The median follow-up period was 43 months (range, 12-95 months). We assessed Hoehn and Yahr stages, activities of daily living, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scales (III) for all patients preoperatively and at six months postoperatively. We measured levodopa equivalent doses (LEDD) and stimulation parameters preoperatively, six months postoperatively, and 12 months postoperatively.\nThere were no significant differences in UPDRS motor scales between two groups at preoperative and six-month postoperative drug off/stim on, but UPDRS III was lower in rLOPD at six-month postoperative drug on/stim on state. A significant difference was noted in the improvement of UPDRS III between two groups for preoperative drug off and drug on conditions, but no difference was seen between two groups in a comparison of drug off/stim on vs. drug on/stim on conditions. Stimulation parameters and postoperative LEDD were not different between the two groups. Preoperative dyskinesia was more common in YOPD patients and, psychotic problems were more common in rLOPD patients.\nPatients with YOPD and rLOPD exhibited comparable UPDRS motor scores and LEDD six months postoperatively. Levodopa could be prescribed at optimum doses following STN-DBS in patients with YOPD as abnormal movements are better controlled following STN-DBS implantation. Stimulation parameters were not different between the two groups. Our results suggest the age of onset does not influence response to STN-DBS Parkinson's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "Pallidal stimulation and pallidotomy are known to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is not known which modality produces greater benefit in patients who have already undergone unilateral pallidotomy. It is also suggested that the original pallidal surgery provides a greater benefit than subsequent pallidal surgery. The aim of this study was to analyze which modality produced greater PD symptom improvement in patients with a prior pallidotomy and whether the chronological order of the pallidal surgery influenced the size of the improvement.\nFive patients who had undergone a prior unilateral pallidotomy for PD were studied. Because of ongoing Parkinsonian symptoms, all patients subsequently underwent contralateral pallidal surgery, either a further pallidotomy or pallidal stimulation. All surgeries were performed by a single functional neurosurgeon and the patients prospectively assessed and scored at routine follow-ups. Paired-sample t-tests were used to detect differences in outcomes after first and second surgeries.\nTwo patients underwent pallidal stimulation and three underwent a second pallidotomy. Mean follow-up was 13.5 months and 12.3 months, respectively. Greater percentage improvements in the majority of scores were found after pallidal stimulation compared with a second pallidotomy, namely Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II off (25.22% vs. -3.27%), UPDRS III off (36.15% vs. 5.21%), rigidity (58.34% vs. 11.54%), tremor (5.56% vs. -30.48%), bradykinesia (48.55% vs. -2.23%), gait composite (16.52% vs. -51.79%), dyskinesia duration (83.33% vs. 66.67%), dyskinesia disability (100% vs. 66.67%), speech (10% vs. -50%), and the proportion of the day spent in the \"off\" state (50% vs. 25%). Comparing outcomes after the first surgery to those after the second surgery, statistical differences were found in dyskinesia duration improvement and ipsilateral dyskinesia improvement after the second surgery (p < 0.004 and p = 0.021, respectively).\nPallidal stimulation produced greater symptom improvement than a second pallidotomy and subsequent surgery did not produce inferior results to the original pallidal surgery.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment and dementia are common features of Parkinson's disease (PD). Patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) often have significant cholinergic defects, which may be treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs). The objective of this review was to consider available efficacy, tolerability, and safety data from studies of ChEIs in PDD.\nA literature search resulted in the identification of 20 relevant publications. Of these, the treatment of PD patients with rivastigmine, donepezil, or galantamine was the focus of six, eleven, and two studies respectively, while one study reported use of both tacrine and donepezil. The majority of studies were small (<40 patients), with the exception of two large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that are the main focus of this review. In the smaller studies, treatment benefits were reported on a range of outcome measures, though results were extremely variable. While the full results of a large RCT of donepezil in patients with PDD are not yet available, significant treatment differences were reported on the CIBIC-plus at the highest treatment dose. A trend toward improvement was also observed in treated patients on the ADAS-cog. The second large RCT found significant improvements in rivastigmine-treated patients compared with placebo on both the ADAS-cog (P < 0.001) and the ADCS-CGIC (P < 0.007), as well as on all secondary efficacy outcomes. Consequently, rivastigmine is now widely approved for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate PDD.\nTaken together, these studies suggest that ChEIs are efficacious in the treatment of PDD.",

    "abstract": "Personality changes are known to occur in idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (PD). The aim of the study was to evaluate whether religious and spiritual beliefs in PD patients are different from age-matched controls.\nEighty-three PD participants, 79 hypertensive individuals not affected by PD and 88 healthy subjects participated to a cross-sectional study. The Royal Free Interview (RFI) was used to evaluate participants' beliefs. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was applied to monitor emotional distress.\nThere was no statistical evidence of a difference between PD participants and the two control groups, the only exception being observed between the left PD onset group and the controls, where the total RFI score was about 5 points higher (t-test: p\u2009=\u20090.0273). RFI total score was uncorrelated with age, severity of illness and depression, but was strongly dependent on the type of beliefs. The percentage of PD participants suffering from anxiety and depression was high (right onset: 54.8%; left onset: 68.6%), while only 15.2% of the hypertensive participants, and none of the healthy controls, had a HADS score above 10 points. Total RFI score was higher in women.\nPD participants maintain their Faith in spite of the disease severity. Differences are found between right and left onset of PD. The possible beneficial effect of religious coping is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) cardiac scintigraphy was used to differentiate Parkinson's disease (PD) with Lewy body pathology from other degenerative parkinsonisms. MIBG cardiac scintigraphy demonstrates the extent of degeneration of myocardial post-ganglionic sympathetic nerves in patients with PD. Because of its specificity for Lewy body (LB) pathology, MIBG scan might also be useful biomarker for the neurodegeneration attributed to PD. To estimate the utility of the imaging technique as a biomarker, we conducted sequential imaging analysis and power analysis.\nSixty-three patients who met the UK PD Society Brain Bank criteria were enrolled in this study. (123) I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy was performed on all subjects, and the heart to mediastinum (H/M) ratio was calculated. A second imaging session was carried out after a mean interval of 268 days.\nSequential imaging revealed a 2.9% decline of the H/M ratio from the baseline to the follow-up image, which reached statistical significance, but the power analysis showed that a relatively large number of patients would be required to demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of any therapy.\nSequential imaging using (123) I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy revealed progressive degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve in 63 patients with PD. Although careful elimination of other disease conditions that damage the cardiac sympathetic nerve system is necessary, (123) I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy may be a useful addition to clinical trials that intend to prove neuroprotection among patients with PD.",

Through discourse analysis, we verified that in spite of the difficulties, many patients show acceptance or conformity regarding to the limitations imposed by the disease, while others still experience anger and hope for a cure. The greatest changes demonstrated by patients and family members regard to the question of dependence and loss of autonomy for work, daily life and leisure activities, which impact on the entire family dynamic. This way, small interventions could contribute to a better coexistence with the disease.",

    "abstract": "Health related quality of life is an important outcome measure in studies involving patients with chronic neurological conditions. Disease specific patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are increasingly used as primary end points in clinical trials. The most widely used disease specific PROM is the 39 item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). The aim of this study was to determine validity and reliability of Persian PDQ-39.\nTwo hundred Parkinson's disease patients attending neurologic clinics of teaching hospitals were recruited. PD patients completed a translated version of the PDQ-39. Internal consistency reliability of the questionnaire was assessed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Reproducibility was assessed across the 3-week interval using the intraclass correlation coefficient. To assess convergent validity, results on the PDQ-39 were correlated with those gained on the SF-36. Discriminate validity of questionnaire was assessed by comparing PDQ-39 scores and the severity and the duration of disease.\nA value of 0.93 (Cronbach's \u03b1) was gained for the summary score (PDQ-SI), indicating high levels of internal reliability. Alpha value of seven domains was greater than 0.70. The intraclass correlation coefficient ranged from 0.47 to 0.90. The range of correlation coefficients between domains of SF-36 and PDQ-SI was from -0.40 to -0.61. There was a statistically significant difference between severity of disease and mean scores of PDSI.\nThis study provides evidence that the Persian version of PDQ-39 is a valid and reliable measure of quality of life in PD.",

    "abstract": "Although electrophysiologic dysfunction of the subthalamic nucleus is putative, deep brain stimulation of this structure has recently been reported to improve obsessions and compulsions. In Parkinson disease, sensorimotor subthalamic neurons display high-frequency burst firing, which is considered as an electrophysiologic signature of motor loop dysfunction. We addressed whether such neuronal dysfunction of the subthalamic nucleus also exists in the nonmotor loops involved in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nWe compared the neuronal activity of the subthalamic nucleus recorded in 9 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder with that of 11 patients with Parkinson disease measured during intraoperative exploration for deep brain stimulation.\nThe mean subthalamic neuron discharge rate was statistically lower in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder than in patients with Parkinson disease (20.5 \u00b1 11.0 Hz, n = 100 and 30.8 \u00b1 15.6 Hz, n = 93, respectively, p < 0.001). The relative proportion of burst neurons did not differ significantly between the 2 diseases (75% vs 73%). Interestingly, burst neurons were predominantly left-sided in obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nThe recording of burst neurons within the nonmotor subthalamic nucleus in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder is a novel finding that suggests the existence of deregulation of the nonmotor basal ganglia loop, possibly left-sided. Potentially, burst activity might interfere with normal processes occurring within nonmotor loops.",

    "abstract": "Most people with Parkinson disease (PD) eventually develop cognitive impairment (CI). However, neither the timing of onset nor the severity of cognitive symptoms can be accurately predicted. We sought plasma-based biomarkers for CI in PD.\nA discovery cohort of 70 PD patients was recruited. Cognitive status was evaluated with the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 (DRS) at baseline and on annual follow-up visits, and baseline plasma levels of 102 proteins were determined with a bead-based immunoassay. Using linear regression, we identified biomarkers of CI in PD, that is, proteins whose levels correlated with cognitive performance at baseline and/or cognitive decline at follow-up. We then replicated the association between cognitive performance and levels of the top biomarker, using a different technical platform, with a separate cohort of 113 PD patients.\nEleven proteins exhibited plasma levels correlating with baseline cognitive performance in the discovery cohort. The best candidate was epidermal growth factor (EGF, p < 0.001); many of the other 10 analytes covaried with EGF across samples. Low levels of EGF not only correlated with poor cognitive test scores at baseline, but also predicted an 8-fold greater risk of cognitive decline to dementia-range DRS scores at follow-up for those with intact baseline cognition. A weaker, but still significant, relationship between plasma EGF levels and cognitive performance was found in an independent replication cohort of 113 PD patients.\nOur data suggest that plasma EGF may be a biomarker for progression to CI in PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis of a fundamental impairment of vocal pace performance in Parkinson's disease (PD) based on a syllable repetition paradigm and the influence of levodopa and deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS). Twenty-two PD patients under stable dopaminergic medication, 14 patients with STN-DBS, and 30 controls were tested. Participants had to repeat the syllable /pa/ in a steady pace. Percental coefficient of variance (COV) of interval length was measured for the description of pace stability. Patients were tested in the OFF state and again in the ON state after levodopa administration or ongoing STN-DBS. COV was elevated in both PD subgroups. COV was not influenced by levodopa administration but showed a further deterioration under STN-DBS. The impaired syllable repetition capacity shows similarities to the patterns of more complex speech rhythm abnormalities in PD and therefore might share the same pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "No previous study prospectively investigated the effects of subthalamic deep brain stimulation on fear of falling (FOF) and falls.\nThe aim was to prospectively explore whether FOF and fall rate were affected after STN stimulation in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nTwenty participants (mean age: 65, SD 6.4) were included. Falls and near falls were recorded (fall diary) during 3 months before and 1 year after surgery. FOF was evaluated using the Falls-Efficacy Scale, Swedish version, FES(S), and the modified Survey of Activities and Fear of Falling in the Elderly (SAFFE).\nAfter surgery, the FES(S) scores of complex activities improved (P=0.026), i.e. median 34 (q1-q3, 26-50) vs 43 (32-55). SAFFE scores also improved (P=0.007): median 25 (22-30) versus 22 (18-27). The rate of near falls decreased (P=0.014). Nine participants reported no near falls. For the remaining ten participants, the median near fall rate decreased from 6 (3-17) to 2 (1-8). The rate of falls showed no significant (P>0.3) difference.\nAfter surgery, fewer activities were avoided owing to the risk of falling, and fall-related self-efficacy had improved during complex activities. The rate of near falls decreased. The results cannot support any change in fall rate.",

    "abstract": "Pain is one of the major nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. We hypothesized that Parkinson's disease patients could show an early diffuse abnormal processing of the nociceptive inputs also in the absence of clinical pain syndrome and that this could represent the physiopathological substrate to explain the high incidence of diffuse pain symptoms.\nWe used the temporal summation threshold of the nociceptive withdrawal reflex and the related pain sensation to evaluate the facilitation in pain processing at spinal level. Fifteen (7 Women; 8 Men; mean age 63.0 \u00b1 9.1) Parkinson's disease patients without clinical pain and 12 (6 Women, 6 Men; mean age 61.2 \u00b1 4.2) healthy subjects were recruited. Parkinson's disease group has been subdivided into two subgroups, 7 early-stage Parkinson's disease patients with unilateral signs (Hoehn and Yahr stage 1) and 8 patients in a more advanced stage of the disease showing bilateral parkinsonian signs (Hoehn and Yahr stages 2 and 2.5), both \"on\" and \"off\" treatments with levodopa.\nA significant facilitation in temporal summation of pain (reduced temporal summation threshold and increased painful sensation) was found in Parkinson's disease patients when compared with controls. This facilitation is more evident in Parkinson's disease with bilateral signs and on the side more affected in Parkinson's disease with unilateral signs. Levodopa administration failed to significantly modify the neurophysiological abnormalities; however, a slight improvement has been detected.\nThe increased gain in pain processing at spinal level in Parkinson's disease patients could be a consequence of the degenerative phenomena involving supraspinal projections implicated in the modulation of pain processing and could make Parkinson's disease patients more predisposed to develop a pain condition.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration in clinically manifest Parkinson's disease affects the substantia nigra pars compacta, and gradually spreads to the limbic cortices and the neocortex. We used MRI imaging coupled with automated surface reconstruction and segmentation methods to examine cortical thickness and subcortical volumes in nondemented, early-stage Parkinson's disease patients compared to matched healthy control participants. These methods, which have been previously used to document cortical thickness changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease but not Parkinson's disease, use MR signal intensity information and the geometric constraints of the cortical and subcortical structures for an accurate tissue classification. Parkinson's disease patients were matched to the control group in psychomotor processing speed and executive functioning, but showed higher anxiety state scores. Our results demonstrated focal cortical thinning in the Parkinson's disease group in the orbitofrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and occipito-parietal areas. Subcortically, striatal volume loss was noted. These results demonstrate that both cortical and subcortical structural changes occur at relatively early stages of the disease, and are discussed in terms of the emotional dysregulation that occurs early on in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Independence of certain gait characteristics from dopamine replacement therapies highlights its complex pathophysiology in Parkinson's disease (PD). We explored the effect of two different cue strategies on gait characteristics in relation to their response to dopaminergic medications.\nFifty people with PD (age 69.22 \u00b1 6.6 years) were studied. Participants walked with and without cues presented in a randomized order. Cue strategies were: (1) internal cue (attention to increase step length) and (2) external cue (auditory cue with instruction to take large step to the beat). Testing was carried out two times at home (on and off medication). Gait was measured using a Stride Analyzer (B&L Engineering). Gait outcomes were walking speed, stride length, step frequency, and coefficient of variation (CV) of stride time and double limb support duration (DLS).\nWalking speed, stride length, and stride time CV improved on dopaminergic medications, whereas step frequency and DLS CV did not. Internal and external cues increased stride time and walking speed (on and off dopaminergic medications). Only the external cue significantly improved stride time CV and DLS CV, whereas the internal cue had no effect (on and off dopaminergic medications).\nInternal and external cues selectively modify gait characteristics in relation to the type of gait disturbance and its dopa-responsiveness. Although internal (attention) and external cues target dopaminergic gait dysfunction (stride length), only external cues target stride to stride fluctuations in gait. Despite an overlap with dopaminergic pathways, external cues may effectively address nondopaminergic gait dysfunction and potentially increase mobility and reduce gait instability and falls.",

    "abstract": "The number of citations a work has received is a measure of its impact. We identified the top cited works in Parkinson's disease. A Web of Science search was performed for articles including the keyword \"Parkinson*\" in the title (the asterisk was included in the search string as a wild card character). Articles with more than 400 citations, the threshold to be considered a \"citation classic,\" were identified and analyzed. The 107 articles identified appeared in 33 different journals, with clinical articles primarily appearing in the New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet, and scientific articles primarily in Nature, Science, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There were 52 laboratory studies, 38 clinical studies, 12 review articles, and 5 classifications of disease. The clinical studies included evaluation of medical and surgical therapies, and the laboratory studies included gene discovery, molecular biology, and cellular biology, as well as animal models and neuropathological studies. High impact topics included deep brain stimulation, levodopa therapy and related adverse effects, MPTP-based animal studies, discovery and evaluation of genetic mutations, and pathogenesis related to oxidative degeneration. More than half of the articles identified in this study have been published in the past 20 years. Prior to 1990, highly cited articles in Parkinson's disease tended to be those that evaluated medical therapies and defined the clinical and neuropathological characteristics of the disease. Since 1990, a high proportion of the citation classics address the genetic characterization of and surgical treatments for the disease suggesting that these are the most significant recent developments and main drivers of impact in this field.",

    "abstract": "Decreased visual function is one of the non-motor dysfunctions of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent evidences suggest that essential tremor (ET) is not 'pure' motor disorder and there is growing evidence that this disease is a multiple-system disorder. In some cases, it is difficult to differentiate ET from PD. In addition, there is considerable controversy regarding the relationship between PD and ET. The objective of this study was to compare color discrimination dysfunction amongst patients with PD and ET and to investigate the clinical relevance.\nCase-control comparisons of 54 patients with PD, 36 patients with ET, and 34 age-matched controls were performed. All cases underwent Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue test (FMT) and clinical assessments on medication. In addition, the association between color vision abnormalities and motor handicaps was investigated.\nThere were significant differences in the total error scores (TES) of the FMT amongst the three groups; patients with the PD had higher TES than the patients with ET and the controls after adjustments for age. In addition, the motor symptom severity in PD correlated with the FMT abnormalities, especially with regard to the axial symptoms.\nThe results of this study suggest that color vision abnormalities may be one of the non-motor clinical characteristics of PD-related dysfunction in contrast to ET. In addition, the severity of axial motor symptoms was closely related to visual dysfunction. Confirmation of these findings as well as the mechanisms underlying these results requires further study.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may predict future development of dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to examine the extent of subcortical brain atrophy in patients with early PD with and without MCI compared to normal controls (NC). Participating in a population-based study were 43 early, drug-na\u00efve PD patients and 41 NC. Eleven patients were classified with MCI (MCI PD) and 32 patients without (non-MCI PD). Volumetric segmentation of 3D-T1 weighted brain MRI was performed using FreeSurfer. Groups were compared applying MANCOVA corrected for total intracranial volume, age, and sex. Results showed that left inferior lateral ventricle and third ventricle volumes were significantly larger in MCI PD than in non-MCI PD and NC. Fourth ventricular size in MCI PD was significantly different from NC and highly correlated with memory performance in MCI PD patients. This suggests that cognitive dysfunction in early PD may be associated with ventricular enlargement.",

    "abstract": "Rare mutations in PARK loci genes cause Parkinson's disease (PD) in some families and isolated populations. We investigated the association of common variants in PARK loci and related genes with PD susceptibility and age at onset in an outbred population. A total of 1,103 PD cases from the upper Midwest, USA, were individually matched to unaffected siblings (n = 654) or unrelated controls (n = 449) from the same region. Using a sequencing approach in 25 cases and 25 controls, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in species-conserved regions of PARK loci and related genes were detected. We selected additional tag SNPs from the HapMap. We genotyped a total of 235 SNPs and two variable number tandem repeats in the ATP13A2, DJ1, LRRK1, LRRK2, MAPT, Omi/HtrA2, PARK2, PINK1, SNCA, SNCB, SNCG, SPR, and UCHL1 genes in all 2,206 subjects. Case-control analyses were performed to study association with PD susceptibility, while cases-only analyses were used to study association with age at onset. Only MAPT SNP rs2435200 was associated with PD susceptibility after correction for multiple testing (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.64-0.86, uncorrected P < 0.0001, log additive model); however, 16 additional MAPT variants, seven SNCA variants, and one LRRK2, PARK2, and UCHL1 variants each had significant uncorrected P-values. There were no significant associations for age at onset after correction for multiple testing. Our results confirm the association of MAPT and SNCA genes with PD susceptibility but show limited association of other PARK loci and related genes with PD.",

    "abstract": "Retrospective assessment of pesticide exposure is complex; however, patterns of pesticide use strongly depend on farming type, which is easier to assess than pesticide exposure. Our aim was to estimate Parkinson's disease (PD) prevalence in five French districts in 2007 among affiliates of Mutualit\u00e9 Sociale Agricole (MSA) and to investigate the relation between PD prevalence and farming type. We identified PD cases from administrative files as persons who used levodopa and/or benefited from free health care for PD. Densities of 16 farming types were defined at the canton of residence level (1988 French agricultural census). We used logistic regression to study the relation between PD prevalence and density of farming types and a semi-Bayes approach to deal with correlated exposures. We identified 1,659 PD cases, yielding an age- and sex-standardized PD prevalence of 3.01/1,000. Prevalence increased with age and was higher in men than women. We found a higher PD prevalence among affiliates living in cantons characterized by a higher density of farms specialized in fruits and permanent crops (multivariable semi-Bayes model: OR(4+5 vs 1+2+3 quintiles) = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.08-1.36; test for trend, P = 0.035). In France, farms specialized in fruits and permanent crops rank first in terms of insecticide use per hectare. Our findings are consistent with studies reporting an association between PD and insecticide use and show that workers in farms specialized in fruits or permanent crops may be an occupational group at higher PD risk.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy and safety of levetiracetam (LEV), administered for management of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) in Parkinson's disease (PD), was examined using a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups, crossover trial. Because of having a period effect, data after crossover point was excluded from analysis. Levodopa-treated PD participants with LID (n = 38) received LEV 500 mg/day, were assessed, titrated to 1,000 mg/day and reassessed, before and after crossover. The placebo group followed the same routine. Primary efficacy was defined from percent change in \"On with LID\" time from patient diaries. Secondary efficacy assessment used \"On without LID,\" \"Off\" time, unified PD rating scale (UPDRS), clinical global impression (CGI), and Goetz dyskinesia scale after levodopa challenge. Safety measures were also performed. On with LID time decreased 37 minutes (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59, 7.15; P = 0.02) at 500 mg/day, 7.85% 75 minutes (95% CI 3.3, 12.4; P = 0.002) at 1,000 mg/day. On without LID time increased by 46 minutes (95% CI -1.55, -0.03; P = 0.04) at 500 mg/day and 55 minutes (95% CI -10.39, -1.14; P = 0.018) at 1,000 mg/day. UPDRS 32 showed decreased dyskinesia duration mean change 0.35 (95% CI 0.09, 0.5; P = 0.009) at 1,000 mg/day. CGI showed LID decreased by 0.7 (95% CI 0.21, 1.18; P = 0.006) at 1,000 mg/day. Patient diaries and UPDRS show no increase in Off time. This exploratory trial provides evidence that LEV in 1,000 mg/day, slowly titrated, could be useful in improving LID as was assessed with patient diaries, UPDRS, and CGI scales, safely, with minimal side effects.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of brainstem MRI measurements in patients with different progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) syndromes and Parkinson's disease (PD). Using 3D T1-weighted images, midbrain, and pons areas, as well as superior (SCP) and middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) widths were measured in 10 patients with Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS), 10 patients with PSP-parkinsonism (PSP-P), 25 patients with PD, and 24 healthy controls. The ratio between pons and midbrain areas (pons/midbrain), that between MCP and SCP widths (MCP/SCP), and the MR parkinsonism index ([pons/midbrain]*[MCP/SCP]) were calculated. The pons/midbrain and the MR parkinsonism index allowed to differentiate PSP-RS from PD with high sensitivity (90%, 100%), specificity (96%, 92%), and accuracy (94%, 97%). Only the pons/midbrain was found to distinguish PSP-P from PD, but with a lower diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity = 60%, specificity = 96%, accuracy = 86%). Compared to PSP-RS, PSP-P experience a relatively less severe involvement of infratentorial brain. The pons/midbrain looks as a promising measure in the differentiation of individual PSP-P from PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of imbalance in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) usually relies on semi-quantitative ratings. Posturography has been proposed as an objective means to assess imbalance but its relationship to clinical disequilibrium is questionable. In this study static and dynamic posturography was performed in 58 patients with IPD and 29 healthy controls. In patients, posturography was related to performance in established clinical tests (pull-test and tandem gait). Posturography did not differentiate between controls and patients with impaired pull-test (IPDimb, n = 28). Patients with normal pull-test (IPDstab n = 30) had lower sway than controls in static (P = 0.042) and dynamic posturography (P = 0.001) and also differed from patients with impaired pull-test in static (P = 0.007) and dynamic (P < 0.001) conditions. In patients with side-steps in tandem gait (n = 21), sway in static and dynamic posturography was increased. Sway measures did not differentiate between patients with pull-test scores 1 and 2 or one and >1 side step in tandem-gait, respectively. Results of ANOVA showed that variance of static posturography was related to performance in tandem-gait (P < 0.0001) but not to pull-test performance (P = 0.91). In contrast, dynamic posturography was related to both, tandem-gait (P = 0.012) and pull-test (P = 0.03). Posturographic sway is increased in patients with IPD with disturbance of tandem gait and pull-test. Posturographic measures did not distinguish between different degrees of deficits in clinical tests.",

    "abstract": "Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are endogenous lipids that bind principally type-1 and type-2 cannabinoid (CB(1) and CB(2)) receptors. N-Arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA, anandamide) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are the best characterized eCBs that are released from membrane phospholipid precursors through multiple biosynthetic pathways. Together with their receptors and metabolic enzymes, eCBs form the so-called \"eCB system\". The later has been involved in a wide variety of actions, including modulation of basal ganglia function. Consistently, both eCB levels and CB(1) receptor expression are high in several basal ganglia regions, and more specifically in the striatum and in its target projection areas. In these regions, the eCB system establishes a close functional interaction with dopaminergic neurotransmission, supporting a relevant role for eCBs in the control of voluntary movements. Accordingly, compelling experimental and clinical evidence suggests that a profound rearrangement of the eCB system in the basal ganglia follows dopamine depletion, as it occurs in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this article, we provide a brief survey of the evidence that the eCB system changes in both animal models of, and patients suffering from, PD. A striking convergence of findings is observed between both rodent and primate models and PD patients, indicating that the eCB system undergoes dynamic, adaptive changes, aimed at restoring an apparent homeostasis within the basal ganglia network.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has recently been proven to be an effective therapy for medication refractory symptoms of Parkinson's disease. As the evidence base continues to evolve, many important issues have surfaced, including: what operation should be performed (brain target[s],unilateral vs bilateral, simultaneous vs staged); when to operate (how early is too early to intervene?), who should be operated on (disease duration, age, symptom profiles and the use of the interdisciplinary screening team); and finally, why to operate (the rationale of surgery vs medication/apomorphine pumps/duodopa pumps/stem cell trials/gene therapy trials). We will address each of these critical issues, as well make the argument that a tailored approach to DBS and DBS targeting will best serve each potential candidate. We will review the multiple peer reviewed studies and we will emphasize the recently available data from randomized DBS studies.We will argue that moving away from a single DBS target (e.g., subthalamic nucleus DBS) and a single approach to DBS methodology (e.g., bilateral simultaneous operations) is a reasonable next step for the Parkinson's disease community. Following careful interdisciplinary DBS screening, a physician-patient discussion has the potential to establish a patient-centered and symptom-specific outcome for each potential DBS candidate. The interdisciplinary DBS team can function together to formulate and to consider an optimal and tailored approach. A tailored approach will allow for the consideration of the complex and numerous variables that may contribute to a positive or negative overall DBS outcome. We will review and provide expert commentary on a potential interdisciplinary approach to selecting unilateral or alternatively bilateral subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus internus DBS. Our approach is aimed to maximize benefit(s) and minimize risk(s) in order to best tailor therapy for an individual patient.",

    "abstract": "To observe the influence of electroacupuncture (EA) of \"Fengfu\" (GV16) and \"Taichong\" (LR3) on morphological changes and apoptotic percentage of substantia nigra cells so as to explore its underlying mechanism in relieving Parkinson's disease.\nForty Wistar rats were randomly divided into normal control, sham-operation (sham), model and EA groups, with 10 rats in each. The Parkinson's disease model was established by micro-injection of 6-hydroxyl-dopamine (6-OHDA) into the right striatum. EA (2 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to \"Fengfu\"(GV16) and \"Taichong\" (LR3) for 30 min, once daily for 2 weeks. HE staining, Nissl staining and immunohistochemical staining were conducted for observing the morphological changes of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and striatum, and the tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) immuno-reaction (IR) positive neurons and nerve fibers. The apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry.\nCompared to the normal control and sham groups, the total number of TH-IR positive neurons and Nissl-stained cells, and OD value of TH-IR positive nerve fibers in the SNc on the 6-OHDA-lesioned side were significantly lower in the model group (P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, the aforementioned 3 indexes of the EA group were increased obviously (P < 0.01). The percentage of apoptosis of SNc on the 6-OHDA-lesioned side was obviously lower in the EA group than in the model group (P < 0.01), but still obviously higher than in the normal group and sham group (P < 0.01).\nElectroacupuncture therapy can significantly increase the number of neurons of substantia nigra and the density of striatum nerve fibers,and reduce the apoptotic percentage of substantia nigra cells in the Parkinsonian rats, which may contribute to its effect in relieving Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Silent laryngeal penetration and silent aspiration (SLP/SA) are common manifestations in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and are frequently associated with dysphagia. However, little is known about saliva aspiration in this population.\nWe investigated the frequency and characteristics of saliva SLP/SA in PD patients with daily drooling (Group A) and in individuals without PD or daily drooling (Group B).\nBoth groups were evaluated by fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) after dyeing the oral cavity with blue dye. The oropharynx was assessed for the presence of the stasis of saliva, and sensitivity was tested by direct tactile stimuli.\nPD patients (n = 28) and controls (n = 18) were evaluated. We observed silent aspiration of saliva in 10.7% and silent laryngeal penetration of saliva near the vocal folds in 28.6% of Group A; however, none of these events was observed in Group B. Sensitivity in the epiglottis and posterior wall of the hypopharynx was decreased in 89.2% of Group A and in 33.3% of Group B, whereas in the aryepiglottic folds and interarytenoid area, a decrease in sensitivity was observed in 92.8% and in 44.4% of Groups A and B, respectively.\nSilent aspiration and laryngeal penetration of saliva are common features in PD patients with daily drooling. The presence of hypoesthesia of the laryngeal structures and the lack of protective reflexes in such patients may play a major role in the mechanisms of SLP/SA.",

    "abstract": "In a multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT00474058), 287 subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) and unsatisfactory early-morning motor symptom control were randomized 2:1 to receive rotigotine (2-16 mg/24 hr [n = 190]) or placebo (n = 97). Treatment was titrated to optimal dose over 1-8 weeks with subsequent dose maintenance for 4 weeks. Early-morning motor function and nocturnal sleep disturbance were assessed as coprimary efficacy endpoints using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III (Motor Examination) measured in the early morning prior to any medication intake and the modified Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS-2) (mean change from baseline to end of maintenance [EOM], last observation carried forward). At EOM, mean UPDRS Part III score had decreased by -7.0 points with rotigotine (from a baseline of 29.6 [standard deviation (SD) 12.3] and by -3.9 points with placebo (baseline 32.0 [13.3]). Mean PDSS-2 total score had decreased by -5.9 points with rotigotine (from a baseline of 19.3 [SD 9.3]) and by -1.9 points with placebo (baseline 20.5 [10.4]). This represented a significantly greater improvement with rotigotine compared with placebo on both the UPDRS Part III (treatment difference: -3.55 [95% confidence interval (CI) -5.37, -1.73]; P = 0.0002) and PDSS-2 (treatment difference: -4.26 [95% CI -6.08, -2.45]; P < 0.0001). The most frequently reported adverse events were nausea (placebo, 9%; rotigotine, 21%), application site reactions (placebo, 4%; rotigotine, 15%), and dizziness (placebo, 6%; rotigotine 10%). Twenty-four-hour transdermal delivery of rotigotine to PD patients with early-morning motor dysfunction resulted in significant benefits in control of both motor function and nocturnal sleep disturbances.",

    "abstract": "The clinical heterogeneity of Parkinson's disease (PD) may point at the existence of subtypes. Because subtypes likely reflect distinct underlying etiologies, their identification may facilitate future genetic and pharmacotherapeutic studies. Aim of this study was to identify subtypes by a data-driven approach applied to a broad spectrum of motor and nonmotor features of PD. Data of motor and nonmotor PD symptoms were collected in 802 patients in two different European prevalent cohorts. A model-based cluster analysis was conducted on baseline data of 344 patients of a Dutch cohort (PROPARK). Reproducibility of these results was tested in data of the second annual assessment of the same cohort and validated in an independent Spanish cohort (ELEP) of 357 patients. The subtypes were subsequently characterized on clinical and demographic variables. Four similar PD subtypes were identified in two different populations and are largely characterized by differences in the severity of nondopaminergic features and motor complications: Subtype 1 was mildly affected in all domains, Subtype 2 was predominantly characterized by severe motor complications, Subtype 3 was affected mainly on nondopaminergic domains without prominent motor complications, while Subtype 4 was severely affected on all domains. The subtypes had largely similar mean disease durations (nonsignificant differences between three clusters) but showed considerable differences with respect to their association with demographic and clinical variables. In prevalent disease, PD subtypes are largely characterized by the severity of nondopaminergic features and motor complications and likely reflect complex interactions between disease mechanisms, treatment, aging, and gender.",

    "abstract": "There has been recent interest in the possibility that impaired neurogenesis may contribute to the decline in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD). We have investigated the effects of commonly used treatments for PD on neural stem cell (NSC) activity in nondemented patients. Postmortem of brain tissue containing the subventricular zone (SVZ) and ependymal layer cells was obtained from 32 nondemented patients with PD. NSC activity was assessed by immunohistochemical staining for RNA-binding protein Musashi1. Regression analyses were then used to identify which clinical factors independently influenced NSC activity. Disease duration was negatively associated with SVZ Musashi1 staining, whereas lifetime levodopa was positively associated in this region. Our findings suggest a positive impact of chronic L-dopa use on the number of NSC in the SVZ of PD patients, which may have relevance for future studies on neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "AAV2-neurturin (CERE-120) is designed to deliver the neurotrophic-factor, neurturin, to the striatum to restore and protect degenerating nigrostriatal neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). A common hypothesis is that following expression in the striatum, neurotrophic-factors like neurturin (NRTN) will be transported from degenerating terminals to their cell bodies in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc).\nWe tested this concept using immunohistochemistry, comparing the bioactivity of AAV2-neurturin in brains of PD patients versus those of nonhuman primates similarly treated.\nNRTN-immunostaining in the targeted striatum was seen in all PD cases (mean putaminal coverage: \u223c15% by volume); comparable expression was observed in young, aged, and parkinsonian monkeys. In the SNc cell bodies, however, only rare evidence of neurturin was seen in PD, while ample evidence of intense nigral-NRTN was observed in all monkeys. NRTN-expression was associated with occasional, sparse TH-induction in the striatum of PD, but nothing apparent in the SNc. In primates, NRTN produced robust TH-induction throughout the nigrostriatal neurons.\nThese data provide the first evidence that gene therapy can increase expression of a neurotrophic-factor deep in the PD brain and that clear but modest enhancement of degenerating neurons can be induced. They also provide important insight regarding deficiencies in the status of nigrostriatal neurons in advanced PD, suggesting that serious axon-transport deficits reduced the bioactivity of AAV2-NRTN by limiting the protein exposed to the cell body. Thus, future efforts using neurotrophic-factors to treat neurodegenerative diseases will need to target both the terminal fields and the cell bodies of degenerating neurons to assure maximal benefit is achieved.",

    "abstract": "We have evaluated the use of silica-dopamine reservoirs synthesized by the sol-gel approach with the aim of using them in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, specifically as a device for the controlled release of dopamine in the striatum. Theoretical calculations illustrate that dopamine is expected to assume a planar structure and exhibit weak interactions with the silica surface.\nSeveral samples were prepared by varying the wt% of dopamine added during the hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate. The silica-dopamine reservoirs were characterized by N(2) adsorption, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The in vitro release profiles were determined using ultraviolet visible absorbance spectroscopy. The textural analyses showed a maximum value for the surface area of 620 m(2)/g nanostructured silica materials. The stability of dopamine in the silica network was confirmed by infrared and (13)C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The reservoirs were evaluated by means of apomorphine-induced rotation behavior in hemiparkisonian rats.\nThe in vitro dopamine delivery profiles indicate two regimes of release, a fast and sustained dopamine delivery was observed up to 24 hours, and after this time the rate of delivery became constant. Histologic analysis of formalin-fixed brains performed 24-32 weeks after reservoir implantation revealed that silica-dopamine implants had a reddish-brown color, suggesting the presence of oxidized dopamine, likely caused by the fixation procedure, while implants without dopamine were always translucent.\nThe major finding of the study was that intrastriatal silica-dopamine implants reversed the rotational asymmetry induced by apomorphine, a dopamine agonist, in hemiparkinsonian rats. No dyskinesias or other motor abnormalities were observed in animals implanted with silica or silica-dopamine.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the neurogenic etiologies of orthostatic hypotension, a non-motor symptoms complex, that tends to be under-recognized and under-treated leading to a major cause of disability for PD patients. This complication is associated with one or recurrent falls causing mortality and morbidity. To the authors' knowledge, there is no study about this condition in Thai PD population. The authors therefore aimed to determine the frequency, clinical and risk factors of orthostatic hypotension in PD patients treated in Phramongkutklao Hospital.\nThe authors enrolled consecutive patients with idiopathic PD over a 10-month period. Supine and standing blood pressure (BP) were measured sequentially as the standard techniques. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) was diagnosed if there was a reduction in systolic or diastolic BP of at least 20 or 10 mmHg respectively within 3 minutes after standing. The authors analyzed for the frequency of this condition as well as determined the risk factors between the OH and non-OH groups.\nThe number of patients enrolled was 82 with the mean age of 69 years. The median duration of PD was 4 years. Eighty-five percent were in Hoehn & Yahr stage 1-3. Thirty-three patients (40.2%) had orthostatic hypotension and 70% of them were asymptomatic. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the risk factors for this condition were the longer duration of PD diagnosis, the more advanced staging and the use of selegiline.\nThe frequency of orthostatic hypotension among the present PD was 40.2%. The longer duration of disease, the more advanced stage of Parkinson's disease and selegiline usage were the factors associated with this non-motor condition.",

    "abstract": "A enantioselective reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic method was developed for the enantiomeric resolution of safinamide mesilate, 2(S)-[4-(3-fluorobenzyloxy)benzylamino] propionamide methanesulfonate, a neuroprotectant with antiparkinsonian and anticonvulsant activity for the treatment of Parkinson disease. The enantiomers of safinamide mesilate were baseline resolved on a Chiralcel OD-RH (150mm\u00d74.6mm, 5\u03bcm) column using a mobile phase system containing 300mM sodium di-hydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 3.0):methanol:acetonitrile (65:25:10, v/v/v). The resolution between the enantiomers was not less than 3.0. The pH value of buffer solution in the mobile phase has played a key role in enhancing chromatographic efficiency and resolution between the enantiomers. The developed method was validated and proved to be robust. The limit of detection and limit of quantification of (R)-enantiomer were found to be 15 and 50ng/mL, respectively, for 20\u03bcL injection volume. The percentage recovery of (R)-enantiomer was ranged from 94.2 to 103.7 in bulk drug samples of safinamide mesilate. The sample solution and mobile phase were found to be stable at least for 48h. The final optimized method was successfully applied to separate (R)-enantiomer from safinamide mesilate and was proven to be reproducible and accurate for the quantitative determination of (R)-enantiomer in bulk drugs.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease most often presents after age 60, and patients in this age group are best managed with levodopa therapy as the primary treatment modality. Unlike young-onset parkinsonism (onset <age 40), this older age group is much less prone to subsequent development of levodopa responsive instability (dyskinesias, fluctuations). When these problems do occur in seniors, they usually can be managed by medication adjustments. The treatment goal is to keep patients active and engaged; levodopa dosage should be guided by the patients' responses and not arbitrarily limited to low doses, which may compromise patients' lives.",

    "abstract": "The focus of cell replacement therapies (CRTs) for Parkinson's disease has been on delivering dopamine-producing cells to the striatum. Fetal grafts have proven the feasibility of this approach, but an appropriate source of replacement cells has restricted the clinical translation. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) have been heralded as an ideal source of dopaminergic (DAergic) replacement cells, as they are viewed as ethically acceptable, easily procured, and readily expanded. It is known that they confer functional benefits, particularly in stroke models, through the release of neurotrophic factors, but their transdifferentiation into neurons is still under contention. We sought to evaluate the neuronal phenotype and functional capacity of adult rat BMSCs after exposure to a novel multistep in vitro differentiation protocol compared with cells exposed to other reported neuronal differentiation conditions. We employed a systematic, comprehensive method of assessment to determine the neuronal differentiation capacity of BMSCs. Our fluorescence-activated cell sorting, immunofluorescent and semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction results confirmed that undifferentiated BMSCs isolated based on their adherence to plastic are of mesenchymal origin and express a range of lineage markers. After exposure to preinduction and neuronal induction steps, BMSCs down-regulate markers of other lineages but fail, as assessed by patch clamp, to differentiate into functional neurons. Thus, for BMSCs to be considered a source of DAergic neuronal replacement cells, their ability to transdifferentiate terminally along a neuronal lineage first must be clarified before attempting to direct more complex specification process required for them to be used in Parkinson's-disease-focused CRTs.",

    "abstract": "The verb-specific impairment present in patients with motion-related neurological diseases has been argued to support the hypothesis that the processing of words referring to motion depends on neural activity in regions involved in motor planning and execution. We presented a group of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with an action-naming task in order to test whether the prevalence of motion-related semantic content in different verbs influences their accuracy.\nForty-nine PD patients and 19 healthy seniors participated in the study. All of PD participants underwent a neurological and neuropsychological assessment to rule out dementia. Subjective ratings of the motion content level of 100 verbs were obtained from 14 young voluntaries. Then, pictures corresponding to two subsets of 25 verbs with significantly different degrees of motor component were selected to be used in an action-naming task. Stimuli lists were matched on visual and psycholinguistic characteristics.\nANOVA analysis reveals differences between groups. PD patients obtained poor results in response to pictures with high motor content compared to those with low motor association. Nevertheless, this effect did not appear on the control group. The general linear mixed model analytic approach was applied to explore the influence of the degree of motion-related semantic content of each verb in the accuracy scores of the participants. The performance of PD patients appeared to be negatively affected by the level of motion-related semantic content associated to each verb.\nOur results provide compelling evidence of the relevance of brain areas related to planning and execution of movements in the retrieval of motion-related semantic content.",

    "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder that responds to dopaminergic drugs, indicating a common pathophysiology with Parkinson's disease (PD). The prevalence of RLS was estimated in a group of PD patients and its clinical and biochemical characteristics were analysed. Forty-eight patients with PD were evaluated into two groups, with and without RLS. Clinical characteristics assessed in both groups were age, gender, duration of PD, Hoehn and Yahr, and Schwab and England scales. Laboratory variables such as hemoglobin, s-iron, s-ferritin and creatinine were obtained. The prevalence of RLS was 18.75%. No significant differences regarding clinical variables and biochemical parameters were observed. The high prevalence of RLS found in PD patients suggests the concept of a common etiological link and it seems that secondary causes did not play a central role in the pathophysiology of RLS in this group of parkinsonian patients.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are vitally important organelles involved in an array of functions. The most notable is their prominent role in energy metabolism, where they generate over 90% of our cellular energy in the form of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria are involved in various other processes including the regulation of calcium homeostasis and stress response. Mitochondrial complex I impairment and subsequent oxidative stress have been identified as modulators of cell death in experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Identification of specific genes which are involved in the rare familial forms of PD has further augmented the understanding and elevated the role mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to have in disease pathogenesis. This paper provides a review of the role mitochondria may play in idiopathic PD through the study of experimental models and how genetic mutations influence mitochondrial activity. Recent attempts at providing neuroprotection by targeting mitochondria are described and their progress assessed.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The major pathological hallmarks of PD are the selective loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and the presence of intraneuronal aggregates termed Lewy bodies (LBs), but the pathophysiological mechanisms are not fully understood. Epidemiologically, environmental neurotoxins such as pesticides are promising candidates for causative factors of PD. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by these toxins could contribute to the progression of PD. While most cases of PD are sporadic, specific mutations in genes that cause familial forms of PD have led to provide new insights into its pathogenesis. This paper focuses on animal models of both toxin-induced and genetically determined PD that have provided significant insight for understanding this disease. We also discuss the validity, benefits, and limitations of representative models.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has been associated with exposure to a variety of environmental agents, including pesticides, heavy metals, and organic pollutants; and inflammatory processes appear to constitute a common mechanistic link among these insults. Indeed, toxin exposure has been repeatedly demonstrated to induce the release of oxidative and inflammatory factors from immunocompetent microglia, leading to damage and death of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons. In particular, proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b3, which are produced locally within the brain by microglia, have been implicated in the loss of DA neurons in toxin-based models of PD; and mounting evidence suggests a contributory role of the inflammatory enzyme, cyclooxygenase-2. Likewise, immune-activating bacterial and viral agents were reported to have neurodegenerative effects themselves and to augment the deleterious impact of chemical toxins upon DA neurons. The present paper will focus upon the evidence linking microglia and their inflammatory processes to the death of DA neurons following toxin exposure. Particular attention will be devoted to the possibility that environmental toxins can activate microglia, resulting in these cells adopting a \"sensitized\" state that favors the production of proinflammatory cytokines and damaging oxidative radicals.",

    "abstract": "Perturbations in protein folding and degradation are key pathological mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent evidence suggests that mishandling of proteins may play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. We have utilized medaka fish to monitor the effects of injecting neurotoxins into the CSF space. In this study, ammonium chloride, tunicamycin, and lactacystin were tested for their ability to disturb lysosomal proteolysis, N-glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum, and proteasomal degradation, respectively. All of the substances tested induced selective loss of dopaminergic neurons, movement disorders and inclusion bodies. Among them, the features of the inclusion bodies that developed after ammonium chloride injection mimicked those of PD: co-localization of ubiquitin and phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein, as well as the presence of LC3 protein in the inclusion bodies. Our study demonstrated that medaka fish are useful for examining the effects of environmental toxins and lysosome inhibition, and lysosome inhibitors may be factors in the development of PD.",

    "abstract": "Dyskinesias are some of the major motor complications that impair quality of life for patients with Parkinson's disease. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of amantadine in Parkinson's disease patients suffering from dyskinesias.\nIn this multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial, 36 patients with Parkinson's disease and dyskinesias were randomized, and 62 interventions, which included amantadine (300 mg/day) or placebo treatment for 27 days, were analyzed. At 15 days after washout, the treatments were crossed over. The primary outcome measure was the changes in the Rush Dyskinesia Rating Scale (RDRS) during each treatment period. The secondary outcome measures were changes in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part IVa (UPDRS-IVa, dyskinesias), part IVb (motor fluctuations), and part III (motor function).\nRDRS improved in 64% and 16% of patients treated with amantadine or placebo, respectively, with significant differences between treatments. The adjusted odds-ratio for improvement by amantadine was 6.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 31.5). UPDRS-IVa was improved to a significantly greater degree in amantadine-treated patients [mean (SD) of 1.83 (1.56)] compared with placebo-treated patients [0.03 (1.51)]. However, there were no significant effects on UPDRS-IVb or III scores.\nResults from the present study demonstrated that amantadine exhibited efficacious effects against dyskinesias in 60-70% of patients.\nUMIN Clinical Trial Registry UMIN000000780.",

PD patients were classified into two groups according to I-IV stage (Hoehn-Yahr) and disease duration (\u2264 5 year, > 5 year) respectively. Region of interest (ROI) were handed drawn on phase images, including putamen (PUT), globus pallidus (GP), caudate nucleus (CN), substantia nigra (SN), and red nucleus (RN), and corresponding signals and phase values were measured. Two-sample t-test was used for comparison between patients groups and normal controls. P values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nthe mean phase values of SN (P = 0.01), GP (P < 0.01) in PD group was significantly different from those in normal controls. However, PUT, CN and RN had no significant differences between patient group and normal controls. Phase values of SN in Hoehn-Yahr III-IV was significantly different from those I-II (P = 0.000), (did not correlated with disease duration). Using phase value of -0.11 as the threshold value, the sensitivity of diagnosis of PD was 60.0% (18/30), the specificity was 57.9% (11/19), the accuracy was 59.2% (29/49).\nSWI provided a non-invasive semi-quantitative method for iron deposition study in PD and it may help us to trace the iron development in PD.",

    "abstract": "Most cases of Parkinson's disease (PD) are sporadic. When choosing an animal model for idiopathic PD, one must consider the extent of similarity or divergence between the physiology, anatomy, behavior, and regulation of gene expression between humans and the animal. Rodents and nonhuman primates are used most frequently in PD research because when a Parkinsonian state is induced, they mimic many aspects of idiopathic PD. These models have been useful in our understanding of the etiology of the disease and provide a means for testing new treatments. However, the current animal models often fall short in replicating the true pathophysiology occurring in idiopathic PD, and thus results from animal models often do not translate to the clinic. In this paper we will explain the limitations of animal models of PD and why their use is inappropriate for the study of some aspects of PD.",

    "abstract": "The present study examines the effects of divalent and trivalent Manganese (Mn(2+)/Mn(3+)) mixture inhalation on mice to obtain a novel animal model of Parkinson disease (PD) inducing bilateral and progressive dopaminergic cell death, correlate those alterations with motor disturbances, and determine whether L-DOPA treatment improves the behavior, to ensure that the alterations are of dopaminergic origin. CD-1 male mice inhaled a mixture of Manganese chloride and Manganese acetate, one hour twice a week for five months. Before Mn exposure, animals were trained to perform motor function tests and were evaluated each week after the exposure. By the end of Mn exposure, 10 mice were orally treated with 7.5\u2009mg/kg L-DOPA. After 5 months of Mn mixture inhalation, striatal dopamine content decreased 71%, the SNc showed important reduction in the number of TH-immunopositive neurons, mice developed akinesia, postural instability, and action tremor; these motor alterations were reverted with L-DOPA treatment. Our data provide evidence that Mn(2+)/Mn(3+) mixture inhalation produces similar morphological, neurochemical, and behavioral alterations to those observed in PD providing a useful experimental model for the study of this neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) is a major component of protein inclusions known as Lewy bodies, which are hallmarks of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The \u03b1-Syn gene is one of the familial PD-causing genes and is also associated with an increased risk of sporadic PD. Numerous studies using \u03b1-Syn expressing transgenic animals have indicated that \u03b1-Syn plays a critical role in the common pathogenesis of synucleinopathies. Drosophila melanogaster has several advantages for modeling human neurodegenerative diseases and is widely used for studying their pathomechanisms and therapies. In fact, Drosophila models expressing \u03b1-Syn have already been established and proven to replicate several features of human PD. In this paper, we review the current research on synucleinopathies using \u03b1-Syn Drosophila models and, moreover, explore the possibilities of these models for comprehensive genetic analyses and large-scale drug screening towards elucidating the molecular pathogenesis and developing therapies for synucleinopathies.",

    "abstract": "Pramipexole, the most commonly prescribed dopamine agonist worldwide, meanwhile serves as a reference substance for evaluation of new drugs. Based on numerous clinical data and vast experiences, efficacy and safety profiles of this non-ergoline dopamine agonist are well characterized. Since October 2009, an extended-release formulation of pramipexole has been available for symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. Pramipexole administration can be cut down from three times to once a day due to the newly developed extended-release formulation. This is considerable progress in regard to minimizing pill burden and enhancing compliance. Moreover, the 24\u2009h continuous drug release of the once-daily extended-release formulation results in fewer fluctuations in plasma concentrations over time compared to immediate-release pramipexole, given three times daily. The present study summarizes pharmacokinetics and all essential pharmacological and clinical characteristics of the extended-release formulation. In addition, it provides all study data, available so far, with regard to transition and de-novo administration of extended-release formulation for patients with Parkinson's disease. It further compares efficacy and safety data of immediate-release pramipexole with the extended-release formulation of pramipexole.",

    "abstract": "A number of neurological disorders are marked by increased or aberrant frequency of neuronal discharge in specific parts of the brain. Administration of drugs such as antiepileptic compounds results in the depression of neuronal activity in the whole brain, with the potential for serious side-effects. In the search for additional therapies to reduce the unphysiological electrical activity of over-active brain foci, we have examined the effect of fibroblasts transplanted to areas responsible for motor dysfunction in hemi-parkinsonian rats, since bursting synchronous discharges in internal segment of globus pallidus (GPi) are thought to be partially responsible for the movement disorders of PD. Fibroblasts express gap junctions and ion channels, and so, when transplanted to brain tissue, can potentially modulate excessive electrical activity.\nNeonatal cortical neurons were cultured on multi-electrode arrays, and their electrical activity was evaluated before and after fibroblast seeding. Unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion was carried out in Fischer rats. Lesioned or control rats were transplanted with either syngeneic dermal fibroblasts, microfine glass beads, ibotenic acid, or physiological saline, in the entopeduncular nucleus (EP). Apomorphine-induced rotational behavior and L-dopa-induced dyskinetic movements were evaluated before transplantation (baseline) and 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks following transplantation. Following behavioral experiments, rats were perfused with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for immunohistochemical study of the brain.\nWe demonstrate in vitro that the introduction of fibroblasts into a network of neurons does not interfere with overall functional measures of activity, while moderately altering the characteristics of synchronous neuronal discharge. In rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigro-striatal dopaminergic pathway, apomorphine-induced rotations were reduced by more than 60% following ipsilateral transplantation of fibroblasts to the EP. L-Dopa-induced dyskinesia was also significantly reduced. Transplantation of inert microspheres, or chemical lesion of the same area with ibotenic acid, did not produce beneficial effects on parkinsonian symptomatology.\nFibroblast transplantation could be an alternative treatment strategy for the parkinsonian patient.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is one of the most common progressive neurodegenerative diseases of the brain, usually leading to significant disability. Rehabilitation, in addition to symptomatic pharmacotherapy, should be the mainstay of treatment for each patient. The aim of this study was to collect data on the use of different methods of rehabilitation treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease living in the area of Bialystok (before 1998 the province of Bialystok) and evaluation of environmental, social and health factors, which affect the use of this form of treatment.\nWe evaluated patients with Parkinson's disease treated in neurological departments in Bialystok and Choroszcz near Bialystok over the next 12 months. It was conducted using a specially constructed for this purpose questionnaire. The course of Parkinson's disease was also assessed in the Hoehn and Yahr and the Schwab and England scale.\nWe have studied 88 patients with clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (48 women and 40 men), mean age 68.7 years. It was found that only 73% of those surveyed had ever been rehabilitated. In 27% of patients had never been used any rehabilitation treatment. It was shown that the level of education positively influences the use of rehabilitation, while the coexistence of additional diseases, living in the country and the older age impede the use of physiotherapy. The stage of disease and sex of patients did not affect the use of rehabilitation. Patients were primarily rehabilitated in a hospital. Among the most commonly used treatments were kinesis therapy, massage and hydrotherapy.\nThe study indicates too low access of patients with Parkinson's disease to rehabilitation and confirms purposefulness of initiating information and education action about the need for physiotherapy treatment in these group of patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by dopamine depletion in the striatum. One consistent pathophysiological hallmark of PD is an increase in spontaneous oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia thalamocortical networks. We evaluated these effects using resting state functional connectivity MRI in mild to moderate stage Parkinson's patients on and off l-DOPA and age-matched controls using six different striatal seed regions. We observed an overall increase in the strength of cortico-striatal functional connectivity in PD patients off l-DOPA compared to controls. This enhanced connectivity was down-regulated by l-DOPA as shown by an overall decrease in connectivity strength, particularly within motor cortical regions. We also performed a frequency content analysis of the BOLD signal time course extracted from the six striatal seed regions. PD off l-DOPA exhibited increased power in the frequency band 0.02-0.05\u2009Hz compared to controls and to PD on l-DOPA. The l-DOPA associated decrease in the power of this frequency range modulated the l-DOPA associated decrease in connectivity strength between striatal seeds and the thalamus. In addition, the l-DOPA associated decrease in power in this frequency band correlated with the l-DOPA associated improvement in cognitive performance. Our results demonstrate that PD and l-DOPA modulate striatal resting state BOLD signal oscillations and cortico-striatal network coherence.",

    "abstract": "Dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD-D) has only been acknowledged in the recent three decades, but research in this field has accelerated. The purpose of this review was to discuss advances in PD-D regarding biomarker correlates and potential therapeutic targets. Attention and executive dysfunction, memory deficits that improve with cueing, and visual hallucinations are characteristic in PD-D. PD-D dramatically increases the disability and misery of the disease. Current treatment for PD-D is symptomatic, modest, and only transiently effective. There is wide agreement that more effective treatment is needed, but this will require more knowledge about PD-D pathophysiology. Advances in the pathogenesis of PD have focused on the substantia nigra, which is the location from where the pathophysiology of motor symptoms primarily arises in initial stages. In contradistinction, pathology studies have suggested that cognitive decline correlates with cortical and subcortical-cortical projection pathway abnormalities. There is evidence that substantia nigra mechanisms, including protein aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein (e.g., Lewy bodies) may also play a role in cortical neuron degeneration. Other different mechanisms, such as Alzheimer's disease pathology (e.g., A\u03b2 aggregation) may be operant for PD-D. Biomarkers of various types are being proposed for the study of PD-D as well as for objective measures of PD-D prediction and progression. Therapeutic targets are currently derived mostly from general PD neurodegeneration research rather than cortical PD neurodegeneration per se. Protein aggregation, genes that are associated with PD, oxidative stress, inflammation, and trophic factors constitute the major classes of therapeutic targets for PD-D. More research is needed on the specific aspects of cortical dysfunction and degeneration that create PD-D.",

    "abstract": "Symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are usually controlled by a continuous titration of medication and addition of multiple therapies over the course of the disease. Therapeutic complex schemes, polymedication, comorbidities and the number of medications required contribute to non-adherence.\nThis cross-sectional survey was performed in 418 patients with PD on treatment with any antiparkinsonian medication. Patient adherence was assessed through physicians' subjective perception and the Morisky-Green test (MGT). Several social, demographic and clinical features were correlated through bivariate and multivariate analyses.\nAccording to the physician's opinion 93.7%, and according to the MGT 60.4% of patients were adherent to parkinsonian therapy. The bivariate analysis showed greater adherence in patients with a high level of knowledge about the disease (62.8%), good clinical control (63.6%), a spouse or life partner (63%) and higher incomes (66%). Negative correlation with psychiatric symptoms was found. In relation to the MGT, the logistic regression model showed a negative correlation between cognitive deterioration and psychiatric pathology and adherence to therapy.\nThe physician's impression overestimated the compliance of patients when compared with an objective evaluation such as the MGT. Cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms are the clinical variables associated with a lower level of adherence.",

    "abstract": "Nonmotor disturbances (NMDs) affect most patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and often have a profound impact on their quality of life. NMDs such as depression, anxiety, fatigue, REM sleep behavior disorder, constipation, delayed gastric emptying, altered olfaction and pain can precede the onset of motor symptoms. Other NMDs, including hallucinations, dementia, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, orthostatic hypotension and bladder disturbances, typically appear later in the course of PD. For most NMDs of PD, nondopaminergic and non-nigrostriatal mechanisms (e.g. neurodegeneration of other transmitter systems in the cortex and brainstem, side effects of medications, genetic and psychosocial factors) are considered more relevant than the 'classical' dopaminergic-nigrostriatal dysfunction. The recognition of NMDs requires a high degree of clinical suspicion, the use of specific questionnaires and ancillary tests. Pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches can be effective, but for most forms of treatment of NMDs, the scientific evidence is limited.",

    "abstract": "Protein misfolding and aggregation are key pathological features observed in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including the misfolding of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) in Parkinson's disease (PD) and \u03b2-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease. While this phenomenon is widely observed, the etiology and progression of these diseases is not fully understood. Furthermore, there is a lack of therapeutic treatments directed at halting the progression and neurodegeneration associated with these diseases. This demands a need for an inexpensive, easy to manipulate multicellular organism to conduct both genetic and chemical screens within to identify factors that may play a pivotal role in the pathology of these diseases. Herein, we describe methodology involved in identifying genetic modifiers of \u03b1-syn misfolding and toxicity in the nematode roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans. Transgenic nematodes engineered to express human \u03b1-syn in the body wall muscles or dopaminergic (DA) neurons result in formation of cytoplasmic puncta or DA neurodegeneration, respectively. Using these models, we describe the use of RNA interference (RNAi) and transgenic gene expression to functionally elucidate potential therapeutic gene targets that alter \u03b1-syn misfolding and DA neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "In the present work we analyzed the profile of high voltage-activated (HVA) calcium (Ca2+) currents in freshly isolated striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) from rodent models of both idiopathic and familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). MSNs were recorded from reserpine-treated and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats, and from DJ-1 and PINK1 (PTEN induced kinase 1) knockout (-/-) mice. Our analysis showed no significant changes in total HVA Ca2+ current. However, we recorded a net increase in the L-type fraction of HVA Ca2+ current in dopamine-depleted rats, and of both N- and P-type components in DJ-1-/- mice, whereas no significant change in Ca2+ current profile was observed in PINK1-/- mice. Dopamine modulates HVA Ca2+ channels in MSNs, thus we also analyzed the effect of D1 and D2 receptor activation. The effect of the D1 receptor agonist SKF 83822 on Ca2+ current was not significantly different among MSNs from control animals or PD models. However, in both dopamine-depleted rats and DJ-1-/- mice the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole inhibited a greater fraction of HVA Ca2+ current than in the respective controls. Conversely, in MSNs from PINK1-/- mice we did not observe alterations in the effect of D2 receptor activation. Additionally, in both reserpine-treated and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, the effect of quinpirole was occluded by the selective L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine, while in DJ-1-/- mice it was mostly occluded by \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA, blocker of N-type channels. These results demonstrate that both dopamine depletion and DJ-1 deletion induce a rearrangement in the HVA Ca2+ channel profile, specifically involving those channels that are selectively modulated by D2 receptors.",

    "abstract": "Polygalae radix, the root of Polygala tenuifolia Willd, has commonly been used for the treatment of amnesia and anxiety in traditional Korean medicine. The aim of this study was to investigate its neuroprotective effects and possible mechanisms of action in models of Parkinson's disease.\nThis study utilized a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, a nitric oxide (NO) production assay, and a caspase-3 activity test as measures of cell viability in PC12 cells damaged by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). The protective effects of PRE against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridium (MPP(+))-induced neurotoxicity were assessed in rat primary dopaminergic neurons and in a mouse PD model in which PRE was administered (100mg/kg/day, 3 days, p.o.) before acute 1-mehtyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) toxicity. Finally, TH immunohistochemistry tests were conducted in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum (ST).\nPRE significantly inhibited 6-OHDA-induced cell damage at doses of 0.05-1\u03bcg/ml with a maximal effect at 0.1\u03bcg/ml. Caspase-3 activity and the production of ROS and NO were alleviated at 0.1\u03bcg/ml. Also at this dose, PRE protected mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons from MPP(+)-induced toxicity. In an in vivo mouse model of PD, PRE protected dopaminergic neurons and fibers from MPTP-induced toxicity in the SNpc and ST. These results demonstrate that PRE has protective effects on dopaminergic neurons via its anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic activity.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been the mainstream surgical procedure for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) during the last decade. Reports from a few individual centres have hinted that women who receive STN DBS are under-represented. We aimed to evaluate the gender distribution of patients with PD who had received STN DBS during the last ten years, and to discuss the findings in relation to studies on gender prevalence of PD.\nA search of the PubMed database of clinical papers in English language related to STN DBS between 2000 and 2009 was conducted. Care was taken to minimize redundancies in reporting of published patients. The proportion of men and women were expressed in total and according to pre-defined geographic regions.\nOne hundred and thirty five papers were eligible for review. The gender of the patients was specified in 119 papers on a total of 3880 patients, of which 63% were men. According to geographic origin of publications, the percentage of men with STN DBS was 68% in North America, 62% in Europe, 69% in Australia and 50% in Asia.\nThe proportion of male patients who undergo STN DBS seems to exceed the reported male/female ratio of patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Lesioning or stimulation of the cerebellar thalamus is an established treatment for rest and postural tremors in Parkinson disease (PD). The cerebellothalamocortical (CTC) pathway can be assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the cerebellum, which suppresses the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1), a phenomenon termed cerebellar inhibition (CBI). Tremor reset can be used to assess whether the stimulated brain area is involved in the generation or transmission of tremor. We tested whether M1 or cerebellar stimulation can reset PD tremor, and investigated the excitability of the CTC pathway in PD.\nTen mild to moderate PD patients in the OFF medication state and 10 healthy controls were studied. Tremor reset was tested with TMS delivered to the cerebellum or M1. CBI was assessed by cerebellar stimulation followed by M1 stimulation at interstimulus intervals of 3 to 8 milliseconds. Subjects were tested both at rest and during arm extension.\nRest tremor in PD was reset by M1 stimulation but not by cerebellar stimulation. Postural tremor was reset by both types of stimulation. At rest, CBI was reduced in PD patients compared to controls. Arm extension decreased CBI in controls and turned the inhibition into facilitation in patients. CBI correlated with the degree of tremor reset caused by the cerebellar stimulation.\nThe excitability of CTC pathway is decreased in PD. Rest and postural tremors in PD are mediated by different neuronal pathways, and the CTC pathway is involved in the generation or transmission of postural tremor.",

    "abstract": "Despite the important role of taste function in nutrition and health, little is known about changes in taste function caused by Parkinson disease (PD). The taste function of 31 PD patients and 29 healthy controls was assessed quantitatively using filter paper taste strip tests (TSTs) impregnated with four basic taste qualities at four different concentrations. The mean TST score was significantly lower in PD patients, as a consequence of taste impairment in the female PD patients (it did not differ significantly in males), which was likely to be attributable to the lower Mini-Mental State Examination score in patients with PD than in controls in women. TST scores in PD patients were not correlated with patient age, duration, or severity of their PD, or olfactory function. The findings of our study suggest that taste dysfunction should be included in the list of nonmotor symptoms of PD.",

    "abstract": "To perform an exploratory study evaluating memantine for several common non-motor problems in Parkinson's disease.\nWe conducted a single center, double-blind, placebo controlled pilot trial of memantine, titrated to 20 mg/day, in PD subjects. Inclusion criteria were intentionally broad and included both fluctuating and non-fluctuating patients. After baseline assessments, subjects (N = 40) were randomized to drug and placebo groups.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have an increased risk of under-nutrition, but we are unaware of any population based prevalence studies of under-nutrition in PD. The main objective of this study was to identify the prevalence, and nature, of under-nutrition in a representative population of people with PD.\nPeople diagnosed with idiopathic PD from within two PD prevalence study sites in North-East England were asked to participate in this study. Those who participated (n = 136) were assessed using a number of standard rating scales including Hoehn & Yahr stage and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Body mass index (BMI), mid-arm circumference (MAC), triceps skin fold thickness (TSF) and grip strength were recorded together with social and demographic information.\nBMI < 20 identified over 15% of the study group to have under-nutrition. The Malnutritional Universal Screening Tool (MUST) scoring system identified 23.5% of participants at medium or high risk of malnutrition. Low BMI, indicating under-nutrition, was associated with greater age and disease duration, lower MAC, TSF, mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC), reduced grip strength and a report of unintentional weight loss. Problems increased with increasing age and disease duration and were greater in females.\nUnder-nutrition is a problem for around 15% of community dwelling people with PD. All PD patients should be screened for under-nutrition; the MUST score is a useful early screening tool.",

    "abstract": "In Germany about 300,000 to 400,000 people are suffering from Morbus Parkinson at present. It is one of the most common neurological diseases both in Germany and in Europe as a whole. With the rising number of elderly people in our population, the number of Parkinson patients will strongly increase as well in future. About 20% of these patients are already in an advanced stage. This stage leaves its marks with motor and non-motor sequelae. With the minority of these patients oral medication is ineffective. For these relatively rare cases an indication for an L-dopa-infusion therapy (duodopa pump), an apomorphine pump therapy or a deep brain stimulation may exist. The indication for one of these 3 therapy forms is given by the neurological clinic in agreement with the patient and is only given in case of failure of oral medication. All 3 therapy options are very expensive. In case of the deep brain stimulation, close cooperation between the neurologist and the neurosurgeon as well as with the patient is necessary. Experts warn about a transplantation of stem cells because there are no clinical studies and only partial clinical improvement with severe side effects are known. The transplantation of stem cells for advanced Morbus Parkinson is not a medically necessary treatment at present.",

    "abstract": "During the past two decades, transcranial sonography (TCS) has developed to an increasingly used brain imaging method that visualizes characteristic patterns of basal ganglia alterations in distinct movement disorders. Since the discovery of a characteristic abnormal hyperechogenic appearance of substantia nigra (SN) on TCS in Parkinson's disease (PD), which is stable during the course of the disease and probably present already in preclinical disease stages, the results of several studies have promoted the idea that this TCS finding in healthy subjects might be a risk marker of PD. The present view summarizes current scientific evidence favouring the idea that the TCS finding of SN hyperechogenicity alone may not be a (strong) risk marker of PD. Especially, it is discussed how reliable this TCS finding is, whether this TCS finding can be regarded as a progression marker or a risk marker of PD, how strongly it may indicate a risk of PD, what else if not an increased risk of PD could be indicated, and which role TCS of SN may finally play in the detection of subjects at risk of PD.",

    "abstract": "Motor complications impair quality of life and cause severe disability in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Since they are often refractory to medical therapy, interventional therapies have been developed, which can provide a considerable reduction of daily off-time and dopaminergic dyskinesias. Continuous dopaminergic drug delivery (CDD) is based on the steady stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors by subcutaneous apomorphine or duodenal L: -DOPA infusions via portable minipumps. Advances in the understanding of basal ganglia functioning and in neurosurgical, electrophysiological and neuroimaging techniques have led to a renaissance of neurosurgery for advanced PD. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is the most invasive procedure promising great benefit and the highest level of independency for suitable patients, but is definitely associated with surgical risks and DBS-related side effects. Each of these more or less invasive therapy options has its own profile, and a thorough consideration of its advantages and drawbacks for the individual situation is mandatory. In this paper, we summarize relevant facts for this decision and provide some guidelines for a responsible counseling of eligible patients.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed at investigating the association between motor subtypes and alexithymic features in patients with newly diagnosed untreated (de novo) Parkinson's disease. This objective derived from empirical findings about an association between the postural instability/gait difficulty motor subtype of Parkinson's disease and more marked symptoms of depression, an affective disorder strongly related to alexithymia. A total of 42 patients with de novo Parkinson's disease underwent neuropsychiatric assessment, including the toronto alexithymia scale (TAS-20) and the geriatric depression scale (GDS-15). On the basis of scores reported at the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale III section, patients were classified within postural instability/gait difficulty motor subtype tremor dominant motor subtype and mixed motor subtype. Patients of the postural instability/gait difficulty motor subtype reported significantly higher alexithymic features compared to patients of the other motor subtypes. Considering the strong association between alexithymia and depression, this finding is in line with previous findings reporting that the postural instability/gait difficulty subtype of Parkinson's disease is associated to more marked psychopathological features, especially affective features (depression and apathy). In conclusion this brief report suggests the usefulness of an early neuropsychiatric assessment of affect regulation difficulties in PD patients, especially in those with a prevalence of akinetic/rigid symptoms.",

Fifty-one genomic DNA samples extracted from two Chinese pedigrees with FPD, the alpha-synuclein genes (SNCA), the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2(LRRK2), PINK1(PTEN-induced putative kinase 1), PARK7(Protein DJ1), PARK2(Parkinson juvenile disease protein 2), the glucocerebrosidase (GBA), and ATP(Ezrin-binding protein PACE-1), were sequenced by the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The gene dose of SNCA was checked. Results. There were only two missense mutations observed, respectively, at exon 5 of LRRK2 and exon 10 of PARK2, and both were enrolled in SNPs. Conclusion. No meaningful mutations could be detected, and other susceptibility genes should be detected in FDP patients in China.",

    "abstract": "Defects in mitochondrial proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (complex I) have been implicated in a number of acquired and hereditary diseases including Leigh's syndrome and more recently Parkinson's disease. A limited number of strategies have been attempted to repair the damaged complex I with little or no success. We have recently shown that the non-proton-pumping, internal NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Ndi1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) can be successfully inserted into the mitochondria of mice and rats, and the enzyme was found to be fully active. Using recombinant adenoassociated virus vectors (serotype 5) carrying our NDI1 gene, we were able to express the Ndi1 protein in the substantia nigra (SN) of C57BL/6 mice with an expression period of two months. The results show that the AAV serotype 5 was highly efficient in expressing Ndi1 in the SN, when compared to a previous model using serotype 2, which led to nearly 100% protection when using an acute MPTP model. It is conceivable that the AAV-serotype5 carrying the NDI1 gene is a powerful tool for proof-of-concept study to demonstrate complex I defects as the causable factor in diseases of the brain.",

    "abstract": "This pilot study investigated whether high-resolution spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) could detect differences in inner retinal layer (IRL), peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and macular thickness between patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and controls.\nBoth eyes of patients with PD and age-matched controls were imaged with the Heidelberg Spectralis(\u00ae) HRA + OCT. RNFL, IRL, and macular thickness were measured for each eye using Heidelberg software. These measurements were compared with validated, published normal values for macular and RNFL thickness, and compared with matched controls for IRL thickness.\nEighteen eyes from nine subjects with PD and 19 eyes of 16 control subjects were evaluated using SD-OCT. The average age of PD patients was 64 years with a range of 52-75 years. The average age of controls was 67 years with a range of 50-81 years. No significant reduction in IRL thickness was detected between PD patients and age-matched controls at 13 points along a 6 mm horizontal section through the fovea. No significant difference in RNFL thickness was detected between PD patients and published normal values. Overall average RNFL thickness was 97 \u03bcm for PD patients, which exactly matched the normative database value. However, significant differences in macular thickness were detected in three of nine subfields between PD subjects and published normal values. In PD subjects, the outer superior subfield was 2.8% thinner (P = 0.026), while the outer nasal and inner inferior subfields were 2.8% (P = 0.016) and 2.7% (P = 0.001) thicker compared to published normal values.\nIn this pilot study, significant differences in macular thickness were detected in three of nine subfields by SD-OCT. However, SD-OCT did not detect significant reductions in peripapillary RNFL and IRL thickness between PD patients and controls. This suggests that macular thickness measurements by SD-OCT may potentially be used as an objective, noninvasive, and easily quantifiable in vivo biomarker in PD. Larger, longitudinal studies are needed to explore these relationships further.",

    "abstract": "Questions exist regarding the validity of patient-reporting of psychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). We assessed observer variability and validity in reporting of impulse control disorder (ICD) symptoms in PD by using the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease (QUIP). PD patients and their informants (71 pairs) completed the QUIP to assess four ICDs (compulsive gambling, buying, sexual behavior, and eating) in patients. Trained raters then administered a diagnostic interview. Sensitivity of the QUIP for a diagnosed ICD was 100% for both patient- and informant-completed instruments, and specificity was 75% for both raters. Approximately 40% of patients without an ICD diagnosis had a positive QUIP, suggesting that many PD patients experience subsyndromal ICD symptoms that require ongoing monitoring. Agreement between patient- and informant-reporting of any ICD behaviors on the QUIP was moderate (kappa=0.408), and for individual ICDs was highest for gambling (kappa=0.550). Overall, a negative QUIP from either the patient or informant rules out the possibility of an ICD, while a positive QUIP requires a follow-up diagnostic interview and ongoing monitoring to determine if symptoms currently are, or in the future become, clinically significant.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) and mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) constitute a novel, evolutionarily conserved family of neurotrophic factors (NTF) expressed in vertebrates and invertebrates. The effects of two-week infusions of CDNF, MANF and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were studied in a rat 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) hemiparkinsonian model. Degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine nerve tract after toxin injection was assessed by measuring amphetamine-induced rotational behavior, and at the end of the experiment by quantifying tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and TH-positive fibers in the striatum. The diffusion of the NTFs into the brain tissue following chronic infusion was also studied. Finally, we examined the transportation of intrastriatally injected (125)I-CDNF within the brain. The amphetamine-induced rotational behavior was gradually normalized in rats treated with CDNF for two weeks following the intrastriatal 6-OHDA injection. CDNF was also able to inhibit 6-OHDA-induced loss of TH-immunoreactive cells of the SNpc and TH-positive fibers in the striatum. MANF and GDNF had no statistically significant effect in any of the above measures. The volume of distribution for MANF in the striatum was significantly larger than that of GDNF after 3-day infusions. Both (125)I-CDNF and (125)I-GDNF were retrogradely transported from the striatum to the SN. No behavioral signs of toxicity were observed during treatment with the three NTFs. These results imply that CDNF may have potential as a neuroprotective or even neurorestorative therapy of PD.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation and the activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) have been proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD). In this study we investigated the effects of the selective iNOS inhibitor GW274150 in the 6-OHDA model of PD. 6-OHDA administration was associated with increased numbers of cells expressing iNOS. Administration of the iNOS inhibitor twice daily for 7 days, beginning 2 days after the 6-OHDA lesioning, led to a significant neuroprotection as shown by assessment of the integrity of the nigrostriatal system by tyrosine hydroxylase immunocytochemistry and HPLC assessment of striatal dopamine content. However, GW274150 displayed a bell-shaped neuroprotective profile, being ineffective at high doses. 6-OHDA lesioning was associated with an increase in microglial activation as assessed by the MHC II antigen OX-6 and the number of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9)-immunopositive cells. NO is a known modulator of MMP-9, and iNOS inhibition was associated with decreased numbers of MMP-9-immunopositive cells, culminating in a reduction in the numbers of reactive microglia. Withdrawal of GW274150 for a further 7 days negated any neuroprotective effects of iNOS inhibition, suggesting that the damaging effects of inflammation last beyond 7 days in this model and the continued administration of the drug may be required.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder diagnosed on the basis of motor symptoms, but that also includes cognitive and visuo-spatial deficits. Though PD is known to initially affect subcortical regions, the cortex also exhibits neuronal loss in the course of the disease as post mortem studies have shown. So far, PD-related pattern of cortical damage remains unclear, because of disease-caused heterogeneity, and also in part because of methodological issues such as the limitations of Voxel Based Morphometry. Here corticometry was used, a technique that decouples local surface from thickness, to obtain a better picture of PD corticomorphometric patterns. We acquired MRI volumes for 33 healthy controls (HC) and 49 PD patients, extracted local cortical thickness and surface area and modeled both of them as a function of group and age for each participant. Cortical thickness averaged on the whole cortex did not differ between the two groups while mean surface area was significantly larger in the PD group. The bilateral parietal lobule, the right superior frontal gyrus, the left cingulate cortex and the left insular cortex exhibited larger local surface area in the PD group. The right precuneus exhibited cortical thinning associated with age in the PD group and not in the HC group. Furthermore, cortical thinning was observed in the PD group compared with the control group in the left medial supplementary motor area (SMA) and in the right dorsal pre-SMA. Finally, we found the left temporal pole thickness to correlate with disease duration, as well as the bilateral occipital cortex and Broca's area. These results suggest that PD etiology is associated with specific cortical alterations, which could account for cognitive deficits that arise as the disease evolves. Finally, our results observed in the occipital cortex as a function of disease duration may indicate the increase in PD-related visuo-spatial deficits, which can sometimes result in hallucinations later on in the disease. In the future, MRI-generated corticometry, combined with additional behavioral markers, may prove to be a useful diagnosis tool to characterize the evolution of motor and cognitive deficits in PD.",

    "abstract": "Motor and emotion processing depend on different fronto-basal ganglia circuits. Distinct sub-regions of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) may modulate these circuits. We evaluated whether stimulation targeted at separate territories in the STN region would differentially affect motor and emotion function. In a double-blind design, we studied twenty Parkinson's disease patients who had deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes implanted bilaterally in the STN. We stimulated either dorsal or ventral contacts of the STN electrodes on separate days in each patient and acquired behavioral measures. Dorsal contact stimulation improved motor function by reducing scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and by reducing both reaction time and reaction time variability compared to ventral contact stimulation. By contrast, ventral contact stimulation led to an increase in positive emotion compared to dorsal contact stimulation. These results support the hypothesis that different territories within the STN region implement motor and emotion functions.",

    "abstract": "The major component of Lewy Bodies (LB), the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) is \u03b1-synuclein, most prominently phosphorylated at serine 129. G-protein coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) has been reported to phosphorylate \u03b1-synuclein in vitro, enhancing the \u03b1-synuclein toxicity to dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila model. Moreover, GRK5 was found in LBs from brain of PD patients. A genetic association study performed in the Japanese population revealed haplotypic association of the GRK5 gene with susceptibility to sporadic PD. We aimed at investigating whether four polymorphisms within the GRK5 gene (rs871196, rs2420616, rs7069375, rs4752293) could represent a risk factor for sporadic PD in Southern Italy. We genotyped 446 patients with PD and 450 controls for these markers and did not find any significant association with the disease at allelic, genotypic and haplotypic level. Our results indicate that the GRK5 gene does not confer risk to sporadic PD in our sample from Southern Italy.",

    "abstract": "This paper compares the use of general and local anaesthetic in patients having deep brain stimulator (DBS) surgery. It is a retrospective case note study of 46 patients treated consecutively with subthalamic nucleus stimulation for Parkinson's disease as practise changed in a Neurosurgical unit.\nThe first 20 patients (LA group) had permanent electrodes placed under local anaesthesia. The remaining 26 patients (GA group) had the entire procedure under general anaesthesia. The groups were similar for age, sex, duration of Parkinson's disease and preoperative levodopa requirement.\nThe clinical results were similar in that within each group, the reduction in levodopa was not only clinically but also statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001 for both, paired t test): for the LA group, the 6-month requirement was 39.4% (29.5-52.6%) of the preoperative requirement and for the GA group, the 6-month requirement was 32.3% (25.2-41.5%) of the preoperative requirement. The reduction in levodopa was maintained at 1\u00a0year. Of note, duration of surgery and length of stay were reduced. The mean duration of surgery was 8.2\u00a0h (7.8-8.6) for the LA group and 7.5\u00a0h (7.2-7.8) for the GA group (p\u2009=\u20090.003). The geometric mean of length of hospital stay was 5.4\u00a0days(4.6-6.3) for the LA group and 3.8\u00a0days (3.4-4.4) for the GA group (p\u2009=\u20090.001) There was no difference in electrophysiological recording.\nThis study describes benefits in the GA group for the entire procedure of STN DBS. In these samples, there was no difference in the adverse effects seen in patients undergoing deep brain stimulator insertion with general anaesthetic compared with local anaesthetic. The use of general anaesthetic did not detract from the known benefits of surgery.",

    "abstract": "Ghrelin, an orexigenic peptide, has multiple functions, which include promoting gastrointestinal motility and influencing higher brain functions. Experimental data suggest that ghrelin has neuroprotective potential in the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD). PD patients show delayed gastric emptying and other symptoms that may relate to disturbed excretion of ghrelin. No data are available on postprandial ghrelin response in patients with PD and idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD)--a condition considered a putative preclinical stage of PD. We measured fasting and postprandial ghrelin serum concentrations in 20 healthy controls, 39 (including 19 drug-na\u00efve) PD patients and 11 iRBD patients using a commercial radioimmunoassay for total ghrelin. For statistical analysis we employed ANCOVA and post-hoc testing with Bonferroni's method. Controls showed a decrease of mean fasting ghrelin serum concentrations in the early postprandial phase, followed by a recuperation starting 60 min after the test meal and reaching a maximum at 300 min. This recuperation was less pronounced in PD and iRBD; the slope of relative postprandial ghrelin recovery was different between the investigated groups (p = 0.007). Post-hoc testing showed a difference between controls and PD patients (p = 0.002) and between controls and iRBD patients (p = 0.037). The dynamic regulation of ghrelin in response to food intake is partially impaired in subjects at putative preclinical (iRBD) and clinical stages of PD. Reduced ghrelin excretion might increase the vulnerability of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons as suggested by animal studies. The impaired ghrelin excretion might qualify as a peripheral biomarker and be of diagnostic or therapeutic value.",

    "abstract": "Motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by a severe loss of pigmented dopamine-producing nigro-striatal neurons. Symptomatic therapies provide benefit for motor features by restoring dopamine receptor stimulation. Studies have demonstrated that delaying the introduction of dopaminergic medical therapy is associated with a rapid decline in quality of life. Nonmotor symptoms, such as depression, are common in early PD and also affect quality of life. Therefore, dopaminergic therapy should typically be initiated at, or shortly following, diagnosis. Monamine oxidase-B inhibitors provide mild symptomatic benefit, have excellent side effect profiles, and may improve long-term outcomes, making them an important first-line treatment option. Dopamine agonists (DAs) provide moderate symptomatic benefit but are associated with more side effects than levodopa. However, they delay the development of motor complications by delaying the need for levodopa. Levodopa (LD) is the most efficacious medication, but its chronic use is associated with the development of motor complications that can be difficult to resolve. Younger patients are more likely to develop levodopa-induced motor complications and they are therefore often treated with a DA before levodopa is added. For older patients, levodopa provides good motor benefit with a relatively low-risk of motor complications. Using levodopa with a dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor lessens adverse effects, and further adding a catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor can improve symptom control.",

    "abstract": "During the last 15 years deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been established as a highly-effective therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Patient selection, stereotactic implantation, postoperative stimulator programming and patient care requires a multi-disciplinary team including movement disorders specialists in neurology and functional neurosurgery. To treat medically refractory levodopa-induced motor complications or resistant tremor the preferred target for high-frequency DBS is the subthalamic nucleus (STN). STN-DBS results in significant reduction of dyskinesias and dopaminergic medication, improvement of all cardinal motor symptoms with sustained long-term benefits, and significant improvement of quality of life when compared with best medical treatment. These benefits have to be weighed against potential surgery-related adverse events, device-related complications, and stimulus-induced side effects. The mean disease duration before initiating DBS in PD is currently about 13 years. It is presently investigated whether the optimal timing for implantation may be at an earlier disease-stage to prevent psychosocial decline and to maintain quality of life for a longer period of time.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder with the particular feature of having various available treatments with proven efficacy. However, no treatment is curative. Recent trial results provided data for the discussion about the potential disease-modifying effect of new drugs as well as of other therapeutic strategies. The changing clinical phenotype following the progression of the disease multiplies the number of treatment targets and makes the application of recommendations from guidelines or other treatment algorithms to the individual patient a complex task. In the present manuscript, we discuss the treatment management of three case studies illustrating different stages of disease with distinct phenomenology. The proposed therapeutic alternatives are discussed based on the best data available; that is, treatment guidelines, clinical trial results or observational data.",

    "abstract": "Psychosis (delusions and/or hallucinations) is a common nonmotor feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Use of the older 'typical' antipsychotic drugs led to worsening of motor symptoms. The introduction of 'atypical' antipsychotics opened up a range of therapeutic options. These agents include clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole and quetiapine. All have been used to treat psychosis in PD with varying success. Clozapine is the only drug with proven efficacy. We review the evidence for the efficacy of quetiapine. Eight open-label studies have assessed quetiapine use in 191 patients, with improvement in psychosis recorded in 152 (80%). In addition to the open-label studies, there have been two single-blind, randomized trials comparing quetiapine and clozapine. These studies suggest that quetiapine has similar efficacy to clozapine in controlling psychosis. Following the promising results of the open-label and clozapine comparison studies, five randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed to further establish the efficacy of quetiapine. Unfortunately, the results have been disappointing. The only positive placebo-controlled study excluded patients with delusions, which seem to be harder to treat than hallucinations. The four negative RCTs discussed seriously undermine the evidence from the open-label studies. The differences in design and interpretation of the RCTs emphasizes the need for further large, well-controlled trials, using strict inclusion criteria, appropriate psychosis rating scales, carer input and clinical significance. Currently, many physicians continue to cautiously offer a trial of low-dose quetiapine empirically. Clozapine should be considered in patients who can tolerate the required blood monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Striatal dopamine (DA) denervation results in a significant loss of dendritic spines on medium spiny projection neurons in Parkinson's disease. In 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated parkinsonian monkeys, spines contacted either by cortical or thalamic glutamatergic terminals are severely affected on both direct and indirect striatofugal neurons. In rodents, indirect pathway neurons appear to be more sensitive, at least in early stages of acute dopamine denervation. The remaining corticostriatal and thalamostriatal axo-spinous synapses undergo complex ultrastructural remodeling consistent with increased synaptic activity in the DA-denervated primate striatum, which may explain the pathophysiological overactivity of the corticostriatal system reported in various animal models of parkinsonism. The calcium-mediated regulation of the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 was recognized as a possible underlying mechanism for striatal spine plasticity. Future studies to determine how alterations in striatal spine plasticity contribute to the symptomatology of parkinsonism are warranted.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of Parkinson disease (PD) has yet to be fully elucidated. We examined the consequences of injections of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), a toxic metabolite of dopamine, into the substantia nigra of rats on motor behavior and neuronal survival.\nA total of 800 nl/rat of DOPAL (1 \u00b5g/200 nl) was injected stereotaxically into the substantia nigra over three sites while control animals received similar injections of phosphate buffered saline. Rotational behavior of these rats was analyzed, optical density of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase was calculated, and unbiased stereological counts of the substantia nigra were made. The rats showed significant rotational asymmetry ipsilateral to the lesion, supporting disruption of dopaminergic nigrostriatal projections. Such disruption was verified since the density of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase decreased significantly (p<0.001) on the side ipsilateral to the DOPAL injections when compared to the non-injected side. Stereological counts of neurons stained for Nissl in pars compacta of the substantia nigra significantly decreased (p<0.001) from control values, while counts of those in pars reticulata were unchanged after DOPAL injections. Counts of neurons immunostained for tyrosine hydroxylase also showed a significant (p=0.032) loss of dopaminergic neurons. In spite of significant loss of dopaminergic neurons, DOPAL injections did not induce significant glial reaction in the substantia nigra.\nThe present study provides the first in vivo quantification of substantia nigra pars compacta neuronal loss after injection of the endogenous toxin DOPAL. The results demonstrate that injections of DOPAL selectively kills SN DA neurons, suggests loss of striatal DA terminals, spares non-dopaminergic neurons of the pars reticulata, and triggers a behavioral phenotype (rotational asymmetry) consistent with other PD animal models. This study supports the \"catecholaldehyde hypothesis\" as an important link for the etiology of sporadic PD.",

    "abstract": "Multiple studies have shown bilateral improvement in motor symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD) following unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal segment of the globus pallidus, yet the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. We hypothesized that STN neuronal activity is altered by contralateral STN DBS. This hypothesis was tested intraoperatively in humans with advanced PD using microelectrode recordings of the STN during contralateral STN DBS. We demonstrate alterations in the discharge pattern of STN neurons in response to contralateral STN DBS including short latency, temporally precise, stimulation frequency-independent responses consistent with antidromic activation. Furthermore, the total discharge frequency during contralateral high frequency stimulation (160 Hz) was greater than during low frequency stimulation (30 Hz) and the resting state. These findings demonstrate complex responses to DBS and imply that output activation throughout the basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical network rather than local inhibition is a therapeutic mechanism of DBS.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that dysfunction of mitochondria is a common feature of Parkinson disease. Functional loss of a familial Parkinson disease-linked gene, BRPK/PINK1 (PINK1), results in deterioration of mitochondrial functions and eventual neuronal cell death. A mitochondrial chaperone protein has been shown to be a substrate of PINK1 kinase activity. In this study, we demonstrated that PINK1 has another action point in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 was enhanced by overexpression of PINK1, and the Akt activation was crucial for protection of SH-SY5Y cells from various cytotoxic agents, including oxidative stress. Enhanced Akt phosphorylation was not due to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase but due to activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) by PINK1. Rictor, a specific component of mTORC2, was phosphorylated by overexpression of PINK1. Furthermore, overexpression of PINK1 enhanced cell motility. These results indicate that PINK1 exerts its cytoprotective function not only in mitochondria but also in the cytoplasm through activation of mTORC2.",

    "abstract": "A functional SNP (rs9347683) in the promoter region of the parkin gene had been implicated as a risk factor in older Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.\nUsing a case-control methodology, we genotyped the SNP in the promoter region of the parkin gene to investigate their association with risk of PD and conducted a pooled analysis of published papers in the English literature.\nA total of 1087 study subjects comprising 595 patients with PD and 492 unrelated healthy controls were recruited. The frequency of \"GG\" genotype in the elderly sub-group (\u2265 65 years) was higher in PD compared to controls (OR=1.11) though we did not observe any difference in allele or genotype frequencies between the cases and the controls (P>0.05) in the overall PD population. Those with genotype \"GG\" were associated with a higher Hoehn-Yahr stage compared with PD patients carrying \"GT\"+\"TT\" (P=0.040). A pooled analysis involving more than >3000 subjects revealed that the frequency of genotypes in PD patients did not differ from the controls (OR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.86-1.12). However, in the group \u2265 65 years of age, the \"GG\" genotype was higher in PD (OR=1.51, 95% CI: 1.06-2.13, P=0.020) among the ethnic Chinese.\nWhile we did not demonstrate a significant association of the parkin promoter polymorphism with PD in our sample, the pooled data suggest that the variant may increase the risk of PD in the more elderly population among the ethnic Chinese, suggesting possible ethnicity-specific effect. Further in vitro and in vivo studies to evaluate this functional parkin variant are warranted.",

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that, in early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), patients with higher reaction times are also more impaired in visual sequence learning, suggesting that movement preparation shares resources with the learning of visuospatial sequences. Here, we ascertained whether, in patients with PD, the pattern of the neural correlates of attentional processes of movement planning predict sequence learning and working memory abilities. High density Electroencephalography (EEG, 256 electrodes) was recorded in 19 patients with PD performing reaching movements in a choice reaction time paradigm. Patients were also tested with Digit Span and performed a visuomotor sequence learning task that has an important declarative learning component. We found that attenuation of alpha/beta oscillatory activity before the stimulus presentation in frontoparietal regions significantly correlated with reaction time in the choice reaction time task, similarly to what we had previously found in normal subjects. In addition, such activity significantly predicted the declarative indices of sequence learning and the scores in the Digit Span task. These findings suggest that some motor and non motor PD signs might have common neural bases, and thus, might have a similar response to the same behavioral therapy. In addition, these results might help in designing and testing the efficacy of novel rehabilitative approaches to improve specific aspects of motor performance in PD and other neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Paralysis agitans was first documented in 1817 by James Parkinson, and therefore the syndrome was named Parkinson's disease (PD). In fact, as early as more than 2000 years ago, the clinical manifestations of this disease have been described in Chinese medicine classics, such as the \"Huangdi Neijing (Yellow Emperor's Internal Classic)\" and \"Zhong Zang Jing (Hua's Zhong Zang Classic).\" In recent years, especially in the past 30 years after reform and opening-up, PD has drawn a lot of attention by Chinese scholars. Although great progress in the studies of PD has been made in recent years, the gap between China and western countries still exists. In this review, we concentrate on the main progress made in epidemic characteristics, etiology, diagnosis and management of PD in China.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa (LD) is the most effective drug to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been reported that the bioavailability of LD is higher in elderly patients than in young patients; however, it is not known how ageing changes the bioavailability of LD among elderly patients. In this study, we compared the pharmacokinetics of LD between two groups of elderly PD patients, early- (75 years or younger) and late-elderly (76 years or older). After oral administration of a tablet containing 100 mg LD per 10 mg carbidopa in 155 PD patients, we measured plasma LD concentrations. Peak drug concentration (C(max)), time to peak drug concentration (T(max)), halftime of drug (T1/2) and area under the curve (AUC) were determined. AUC and T1/2 were significantly higher and longer, respectively, in the late-elderly group than in the early-elderly group (p < 0.05 and <0.05, respectively). However, C(max) and T(max) were not statistically different between the groups. The present data indicate that LD absorption is consistent in PD patients, regardless of age. The difference in oral LD bioavailability between the groups may result from a difference in excretion ability. Physicians should consider LD pharmacokinetics when treating elderly PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Modified Yeoldahanso-tang (MYH) is a Korean herbal formula, containing 10 herbs: Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi, Angelica tenuissima Nakai, Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Platycodon grandiflorum (Jacq), Angelicae Dahurica, Cimicifuga heracleifolia Kom, Raphanus sativa L., Polygala tenuifolia (Willd.), Acorus gramineus Soland. and Dimocarpus longan Lour. The constitutive ratio of the ten herbs is at 6:4:2:1:2:2:2:4:6:6 in dry weight. MYH has been used to treat amnesia, hypochondria and dementia in Korea. In this study, we explored the possibility of using MYH in the prevention and treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Specifically, we made an effort to demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of MYH using experimental methods similar to those used in a recent study of PD.\n1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) (400\u03bcM) was used to induce cytotoxicity in NGF (nerve growth factor)-differentiated PC12 cells. Cell viability was measured using a MTT assay. Induction of autophagy by MYH in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells was measured using an immunoblotting assay with LC3 and beclin 1 antibodies. The proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin (10\u03bcM) was used to cause UPS dysfunction in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. Clearance of aggregated proteins by MYH was measured using an immunoblotting assay with an ubiquitin antibody. 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophenylpyridine (MPTP) (20mg/kg, 4 times i.p.) caused substantia nigra injuries in C57BL/6 mice. Dopamine (DA) neurons were identified using a tyrosine hydroxylase-immunohistochemistry (TH-IHC) assay with a rabbit anti-TH antibody.\nOur findings indicate that MYH provides protection against MPP+-induced injury in NGF-differentiated PC12 cell. And MYH provides neuroprotection against lactacystin-induced NGF-differentiated PC12 cell death, which effect is partially mediated by autophagy enhancement through enhanced degradation of aggregated proteins. Additionally, in a C57BL/6 mice model with MPTP-induced substantia nigra injuries, MYH inhibits both the loss of TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the reduction of the optical density of TH-IR fibers in the striatum (ST).\nAll of our results indicate that MYH treatment has neuroprotective effects that are partially mediated by autophagy enhancement. MYH may be a promising herbal formula for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, especially PD.",

    "abstract": "Rigidity is a cardinal symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and is often clinically assessed by passively flexing and extending a patient's limb. Objective measurements had been employed to examine rigidity in PD subjects, including wrist, elbow, knee and trunk. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between an objective measurement of trunk rigidity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and functional status in patients with mild to moderate PD.\nAn isokinetic dynamometer Biodex System 3 was employed to assess trunk rigidity in 36 PD patients. HRQoL was assessed with the EuroQol-5D and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 items (PDQ-39). Functional status was measured with the Schwab and England scale.\nTrunk rigidity was correlated with the HRQoL assessed with the mobility, cognition and stigma PDQ-39 domains and the total PDQ-39 scores. No correlations were found among trunk muscle tone assessed with the isokinetic dynamometer and the EuroQoL-5D. Functional status was correlated with the trunk extensors rigidity at all angular velocities.\nThe results from this study suggest that the axial motor impairments impact on QoL and functional status in patients with PD. Further studies are needed with quantitative devices for axial rigidity assessment to determine the relationship between trunk rigidity in PD patients with higher disease severity and HRQoL scales.",

    "abstract": "There is very little data on the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) in patients with schizophrenia. Since schizophrenia is treated primarily with dopamine receptor blocking medications, it is unknown if the beneficial effects of anti-PD medications might be blocked or if the drugs may trigger worsened psychosis. A chart review was performed which identified nine patients with schizophrenia and presumed Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (IPD). None of the patients suffered worsened psychosis from l-Dopa or a dopamine agonist if taking antipsychotics, and motor response did not appear blunted.",

    "abstract": "Three previous cohort studies in the USA reported that dairy product consumption was significantly associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in men, but not in women. We examined the relationship between consumption of dairy products, calcium, and vitamin D and the risk of PD using data from a multicenter hospital-based case-control study in Japan. Included were 249 cases within 6 years of onset of PD based on the UK PD Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria. Controls were 368 inpatients and outpatients without a neurodegenerative disease. Information on dietary factors was collected using a validated self-administered diet history questionnaire. Adjustment was made for sex, age, region of residence, pack-years of smoking, years of education, body mass index, and dietary factors including cholesterol, dietary glycemic index, vitamin E, \u03b2-carotene, vitamin B(6), caffeine, iron, and alcohol. Total dairy product consumption was not materially associated with the risk of PD (P for trend\u00a0=\u00a00.62). No evident relationships were observed between intake of milk, yogurt, cheese, or ice cream and the risk of PD (P for trend\u00a0=\u00a00.75, 0.63, 0.59, and 0.35, respectively). There were no measurable associations between consumption of calcium or vitamin D and PD (P for trend\u00a0=\u00a00.37 and 0.69, respectively). No significant interactions were observed between the dietary exposures and sex regarding PD. Our results suggest that intake of dairy products, calcium, and vitamin D was not related to PD, regardless of sex. However, such null relationships might be a consequence of PD.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated performance of unimanual and bimanual anti-phase and in-phase upper limb line drawing using three different types of cues. Fifteen Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, 15 elderly, and 15 young adults drew lines away from and towards their body on a tabletop every 1000 ms for 30 s under three different cueing conditions: (1) verbal ('up', 'down'); (2) auditory (high tone, low tone); (3) visual (target line switched from top to bottom). PD patients had larger and more variable amplitudes which may be related to the finding that they also produced more curvilinear movements than young and elderly adults. Consistent with previous research, when compared to the elderly and young adult group PD patients produced a mean relative phase which deviated more from the instructed coordination modes and they showed larger variability of relative phase in bimanual coordination, especially in anti-phase conditions. For all groups, auditory and verbal cues resulted in lower coefficient of variance of cycle time, lower variability of amplitude and lower variability of relative phase than visual cues. The benefit of auditory cues may be related to the timing nature of the task or factors related to the auditory cues (e.g., reduced attentional demands, more kinesthetic focus).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder contributed by both environmental and genetic factors. The inconsistent findings in genetic association studies may be due to unrecognized interactions with other genetic or environmental factors. Therefore, we assessed the combined effects of genetic variants of three candidate genes of familial PD and environmental exposure on risk of PD in Taiwanese population. A total of 744 study subjects, 453 PD cases and 291 ethnicity-matched controls, were included. The genetic variants on the PINK1, BDNF, and LRRK2 genes were sequenced accordingly. We used a regression approach based on a generalized linear model to evaluate single-locus genotype effects and detection of gene-environment interaction by incorporating interaction terms in the model. We found a significant difference of LRRK2 G2385R and R1628P between PD patients and controls, which confirmed our previous findings. A logistic regression model which included gene-environment interactions was applied. Notably, we identified the variant of LRRK2 T4939A (S1647T) (TT, OR\u00a0=\u00a0-0.36, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) is associated with increased PD risk, after considering the interaction effects with environmental factors in the model. Additionally, two novel interactions were detected: pesticide exposure with BDNF (OR\u00a0=\u00a0-0.85, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and to a lesser extent, with PINK1 (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.99, p\u00a0=\u00a00.07). Our findings reinforced the importance that PD risk is modulated by both genetic and environmental exposures. LRRK2 S1647T may be another risk factor for PD development in our ethnicity while considering the joint interaction effects with environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "The iron content of the substantia nigra pars compacta increases in the brains of Parkinson's disease patients. Hence, its removal by iron chelators may retard the progression of the disease. However, information on the ability of clinically available iron chelators to cross the blood brain barrier and be neuroprotective is limited. In this present study three iron chelators, which are currently approved for clinical use, namely the hexadendate, deferrioxamine, the bidentate deferiprone and the tridendate chelator deferasirox have been investigated for their efficacy to induce neuroprotection. Previous studies have shown that both deferiprone and deferrioxamine exert neuroprotection in the 6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA) model but no such studies have investigated deferasirox. Focal administration of deferasirox (0.5, 2 and 10 \u03bcg) into the substantia nigra pars compacta of rats significantly attenuated the loss of dopaminergic neurons and striatal dopamine content resulting from 6-OHDA toxicity. Systemic administration of deferasirox (20 mg/kg), deferiprone (10 mg/kg) or deferrioxamine (30 mg/kg), to the 6-OHDA rat model of Parkinson's disease, significantly attenuated the loss of dopaminergic neurons and striatal dopamine content. Further studies to comprehend the action of these chelators showed that local application of either 0.4 mM deferrioxamine, or 1 mM deferasirox, via a microdialysis probe into the striatum, prior to that of 200 \u03bcM 6-OHDA, prevented the generation of hydroxyl radicals. Our results confirm that the administration of these chelators show therapeutic efficacy and should be considered as therapeutic agents for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the use of probabilistic classification, namely finite mixture modelling, for identification of complex disease phenotypes, given cross-sectional data. In particular, if focuses on posterior probabilities of subgroup membership, a standard output of finite mixture modelling, and how the quantification of uncertainty in these probabilities can lead to more detailed analyses. Using a Bayesian approach, we describe two practical uses of this uncertainty: (i) as a means of describing a person's membership to a single or multiple latent subgroups and (ii) as a means of describing identified subgroups by patient-centred covariates not included in model estimation. These proposed uses are demonstrated on a case study in Parkinson's disease (PD), where latent subgroups are identified using multiple symptoms from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a disabling and progressive neurological condition characterized by multiple motor and non motor symptoms that contribute to deterioration in quality of life. The diversity of symptoms associated with the disease and its management affect the patients on their physical, social and mental quality of life. The aim of this study was to identify key dimensions of health related quality of life (HRQOL) in a population affected with Parkinson's disease with a degree of mild-moderate impairment. Thirty six patients with Parkinson were recruited. The Hoehn and Yarh scale, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rate Scale, the scale of activities of daily life and Schwab & England Get Up & Go Test were applied. HRQOL was assessed with the EuroQol-5D and the specific questionnaire Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 items. The dimensions of the PDQ-39, except the PDQ-39 Pain domain and the EuroQol-5D correlated significantly with the severity of the disease. HRQOL was correlated with the functional status of patients. Only the PDQ-39 pain domain correlated with the risk of falls. Our results suggest that the HRQOL of patients with PD, in a state of mild-moderate impairment, is strongly influenced by disease severity and functional status.",

Plasma CRP levels were determined and tests for associations with disease parameters were performed. The average level of CRP was 3.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, and 45.2% of the patients (n\u00a0=\u00a033) had a level above 3.0\u00a0\u03bcmol/L.

    "abstract": "This study was carried out to evaluate the association between selegiline use and Parkinson's disease (PD) progression in a clinical sample by evaluating modified Hoehn and Yahr Stage (H&Y) stage transition times. Data were obtained from the movement disorder database of the National Neuroscience Institute in Singapore. Cox regression analysis was used to examine the association between baseline variables and H&Y stage transition times. In multi-variate Cox regression analysis, patients who were of younger age, shorter PD duration, lower Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores, on selegiline treatment (\u2265 3 years) and not on COMT inhibitors were associated with longer transition times from stage 2-2.5. Patients who were treated with selegiline (\u2265 3 years) and not on COMT inhibitors experienced longer transition times from stage 2.5-3. In conclusion, selegiline use for 3 years or more in early PD was associated with a slower progression of PD as evaluated by H&Y transition times.",

    "abstract": "To review the literature and to identify practice gaps in the management of the hospitalized Parkinson's disease (PD) patient.\nPatients with PD are admitted to hospitals at higher rates, and frequently have longer hospital stays than the general population. Little is known about outpatient interventions that might reduce the need for hospitalization and also reduce hospital-related complications.\nA literature review was performed on PubMed about hospitalization and PD between 1970 and 2010. In addition, in press peer-reviewed papers or published abstracts known to the authors were included. Information was reviewed by a National Parkinson Foundation workgroup and a narrative review article was generated.\nMotor disturbances in PD are believed to be a causal factor in the higher rates of admissions and complications. However, other conditions are commonly recorded as the primary reason for hospitalization including motor complications, reduced mobility, lack of compliance, inappropriate use of neuroleptics, falls, fractures, pneumonia, and other important medical problems. There are many relevant issues related to hospitalization in PD. Medications, dosages and specific dosage schedules are critical. Staff training regarding medications and medication management may help to avoid complications, particularly those related to reduced mobility, and aspiration pneumonia. Treatment of infections and a return to early mobility is also critical to management.\nEducational programs, recommendations, and guidelines are needed to better train interdisciplinary teams in the management of the PD patient. These initiatives have the potential for both cost savings and improved outcomes from a preventative and a hospital management standpoint.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that variation in the SNCA, MAPT, and GSK3B genes interacts in affecting risk for Parkinson disease (PD). In the current study, we attempt to validate previously published findings, evaluating gene-gene interactions between SNCA, MAPT, and GSK3B in association with PD.\nThree Caucasian PD patient-control series from the United States, Ireland, and Norway (combined n = 1020 patients and 1095 controls) were genotyped for SNCA rs356219, MAPT H1/H2-discriminating SNP rs1052553, and GSK3B rs334558 and rs6438552.\nOur findings indicate that as previously reported, the SNCA rs356219-G allele and MAPT rs1052553 (H1 haplotype) were both associated with an increased risk of PD, whilst contrary to previous reports, GSK3B variants were not. No pair-wise interaction was observed between SNCA, MAPT, and GSK3B; the risk effects of SNCA rs356219-G and MAPT rs1052553-H1 were seen in a similar manner across genotypes of other variants, with no evidence suggesting synergistic, antagonistic, or deferential effects.\nIn the Caucasian patient-control series examined, risk for PD was influenced by variation in SNCA and MAPT but not GSK3B. Additionally, those three genes did not interact in determining disease risk.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine neurotransmission plays a key role in several brain activities, including motor, cognitive, and behavioral functions. Parkinson's disease (PD) typically begins with asymmetrical motor features related to asymmetrical dopamine denervation. This study was designed to examine whether distinct cognitive, behavioral, and personality features are related to this asymmetry.\nFifty-six patients with mild PD and lateralized motor features were grouped according to dominant side of motor features and evaluated using a neuropsychological assessment focused on attention and executive functions, impulse control disorders, and personality inventory.\nThere were no differences in neuropsychological functions between patients with right and left lateralized PD, but differences occurred in personality features. Patients with motor impairment predominant on the left-hand side had prevalence of hypomania and conversion profile.\nThis study suggests that side dominance of dopaminergic denervation may be related to personality features in patients with PD that could influence behavioral aspects.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) affects speech in the majority of patients. Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is particularly effective in reducing tremor and rigidity. However, its effect on speech is variable. The aim of this pilot study was to quantify the effects of bilateral STN-DBS and medication on articulation, using electropalatography (EPG). Two patients, PT1 and PT2, were studied under four conditions: on and off medication and ON and OFF stimulation. The EPG protocol consisted of a number of target words with alveolar and velar stops, repeated 10 times in random order. The motor part III of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) indicated significantly improved motor scores in the ON stimulation condition in both patients. However, PT1's articulation patterns deteriorated with stimulation whereas PT2 showed improving articulatory accuracy in the same condition. The results revealed different effects of stimulation and medication on articulation particularly with regard to timing. The study quantified less articulatory undershoot for velar stops in comparison to alveolars. Furthermore, the findings provided preliminary evidence that stimulation with medication has a more detrimental effect on articulation than stimulation without medication.",

    "abstract": "Motor performance is profoundly influenced by sensory information, yet sensory input can be noisy and uncertain. The basal ganglia and the cerebellum are important in processing sensory uncertainty, as the basal ganglia incorporate the uncertainty of predictive reward cues to reinforce motor programs, and the cerebellum and its connections mitigate the effect of ambiguous sensory input on motor performance through the use of forward models. Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is classically considered a primary disease of the basal ganglia, alterations in cerebellar activation are also observed, which may have consequences for the processing of sensory uncertainty. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of visual uncertainty on motor performance in 15 PD patients and ten age-matched control subjects. Subjects performed a visually guided tracking task, requiring large-amplitude arm movements, by tracking with their index finger a moving target along a smooth trajectory. To induce visual uncertainty, the target position randomly jittered about the desired trajectory with increasing amplitudes. Tracking error was related to target ambiguity to a significantly greater degree in PD subjects off medication compared with control subjects, indicative of susceptibility to visual uncertainty in PD. l-Dopa partially ameliorated this deficit. We interpret our findings as suggesting an inability of PD subjects to create adequate forward models and/or de-weight less informative visual input. As these computations are normally associated with the cerebellum and connections, we suggest that alterations in normal cerebellar functioning may be a significant contributor to altered motor performance in PD.",

Analyzing data from a large cross-sectional study of impulse control disorders (ICDs) in PD, amantadine use (n = 728), vs no amantadine use (n = 2,357), was positively associated with a diagnosis of any ICD (17.6% vs 12.4%, p < 0.001) and compulsive gambling specifically (7.4% vs 4.2%, p < 0.001). This amantadine association remained after controlling for covariates of amantadine use, including both dopamine agonist use and levodopa dosage. Further research, including larger clinical trials, is needed to assess the role of amantadine in the development and treatment of ICDs in PD.",

    "abstract": "During the initiation of stepping, anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) for lateral weight transfer and propulsion normally precede the onset of locomotion. In Parkinson's disease (PD), impaired step initiation typically involves altered APA ground force production with delayed step onset and deficits in stepping performance. If, as in stance and gait, sensory information about lower limb load is important for the control of stepping, then perturbations influencing loading conditions could affect the step initiation process. This study investigated the influence of changes in lower limb loading during step initiation in patients with PD and healthy control subjects. Participants performed rapid self-triggered step initiation with the impending single stance limb positioned over a pneumatically actuated platform. In perturbation trials, the stance limb ground support surface was either moved vertically downward (DROP) or upward (ELEVATE) by 1.5 cm shortly after the onset of the APA phase. Overall, PD patients demonstrated a longer APA duration, longer time to first step onset, and slower step speed than controls. In both groups, the DROP perturbation reinforced the intended APA kinetic changes for lateral weight transfer and resulted in a significant reduction in APA duration, increase in peak amplitude, and earlier time to first step onset compared with other conditions. During ELEVATE trials that opposed the intended weight transfer forces both groups rapidly adapted their stepping to preserve standing stability by decreasing step length and duration, and increasing step height and foot placement laterally. The findings suggested that sensory information associated with limb load and/or foot pressure modulates the spatial and temporal parameters of posture and locomotion components of step initiation in interaction with a centrally generated feedforward mode of neural control. Moreover, impaired step initiation in PD may at least acutely be enhanced by augmenting the coupling between posture and locomotion.",

    "abstract": "Over the last few decades, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) have emerged as multifaceted players in not only the pathogenesis, but potential treatment, of numerous diseases. They activate diverse intracellular signaling cascades known to have extensive crosstalk, and have been best studied for their effects in cardiology and cancer biology. Recent work with the two factors indicates that the activity of one growth factor is often directly related to the action of the other. Their respective neuroprotective effects, in particular, raise important questions regarding the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "14-3-3 proteins are important negative regulators of cell death pathways. Recent studies have revealed alterations in 14-3-3s in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the ability of 14-3-3s to interact with alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), a protein central to PD pathophysiology. In a transgenic \u03b1-syn mouse model, we found reduced expression of 14-3-3\u03b8, \u03b5, and \u03b3. These same isoforms prevent \u03b1-syn inclusion formation in an H4 neuroglioma cell model. Using dopaminergic cell lines stably overexpressing each 14-3-3 isoform, we found that overexpression of 14-3-3\u03b8, \u03b5, or \u03b3 led to resistance to both rotenone and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)), while other isoforms were not protective against both toxins. Inhibition of a single protective isoform, 14-3-3\u03b8, by shRNA did not increase vulnerability to neurotoxic injury, but toxicity was enhanced by broad-based inhibition of 14-3-3 action with the peptide inhibitor difopein. Using a transgenic C. elegans model of PD, we confirmed the ability of both human 14-3-3\u03b8 and a C. elegans 14-3-3 homolog (ftt-2) to protect dopaminergic neurons from \u03b1-syn toxicity. Collectively, these data show a strong neuroprotective effect of enhanced 14-3-3 expression - particularly of the 14-3-3\u03b8, \u03b5, and \u03b3 isoforms - in multiple cellular and animal models of PD, and point to the potential value of these proteins in the development of neuroprotective therapies for human PD.",

The realization of an experimental set-up for the quantitative and objective description of drawing using optoelectronic systems, which could be used when a quantification of the realization of specific drawing tests is required. Methods. Healthy subjects, subjects with Parkinson's Disease and subjects with Parkinson's Disease and Dementia were evaluated by the Mini Mental Scale Evaluation and by a new approach to the Clock Drawing Test, based on an optoelectronic acquisition. The new protocol hereby described aims to define a parameter related to the movement kinematics in the Clock Drawing test execution. Results. The experimental set-up revealed to be valid introducing new objective measurements beside the subjective Clock Drawing Test. This paper suggests the applicability of this protocol to other fields of motor and cognitive valuation, as well as the introduction of new parameters related to the graphic movement.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we have found that mildronate [3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium) propionate dihydrate], a small molecule with charged nitrogen and oxygen atoms, protects mitochondrial metabolism that is altered by inhibitors of complex I and has neuroprotective effects in an azidothymidine-neurotoxicity mouse model. In the present study, we investigated the effects of mildronate in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) that was generated via a unilateral intrastriatal injection of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). We assessed the expression of cell biomarkers that are involved in signaling cascades and provide neural and glial integration: the neuronal marker TH (tyrosine hydroxylase); ubiquitin (a regulatory peptide involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system); Notch-3 (a marker of progenitor cells); IBA-1 (a marker of microglial cells); glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP (a marker of astrocytes); and inducible nitric oxide synthase, iNOS (a marker of inflammation). The data show that in the 6-OHDA-lesioned striatum, mildronate completely prevented the loss of TH, stimulated Notch-3 expression and decreased the expression of ubiquitin, GFAP and iNOS. These results provide evidence for the ability of mildronate to control the expression of an array of cellular proteins and, thus, impart multi-faceted homeostatic mechanisms in neurons and glial cells in a rat model of PD. We suggest that the use of mildronate provides a protective effect during the early stages of PD that can delay or halt the progression of this neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common form of movement disorder and affects approximately 4% of the population aged over 80 years old. Currently, PD cannot be prevented or cured, and no single diagnostic biomarkers are available. Notably, recent studies suggest that two familial PD-linked molecules, \u03b1-synuclein and DJ-1, are present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and that their levels may be altered during the progression of PD. In this regard, sensitive and accurate methods for evaluation of \u03b1-synuclein and DJ-1 levels in the CSF and blood have been developed, and the results suggest that the levels of both molecules are significantly decreased in the CSF in patients with PD compared with age-matched controls. Furthermore, specific detection and quantification of neurotoxic oligometric forms of \u03b1-synuclein in the blood using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays might be expected as potential peripheral biomarkers for PD, although further validation is required. Currently, neither \u03b1-synuclein nor DJ-1 is satisfactory as a single biomarker for PD, but combinatory evaluation of these biological fluid molecules with other biomarkers and imaging techniques may provide reliable information for diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Loss of dopaminergic neurons is primarily responsible for the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD); thus, neuroprotective and/or neuroregenerative strategies remain critical to the treatment of this increasingly prevalent disease. Here we explore a novel approach to neurotrophic factor-based therapy by engineering zinc finger protein transcription factors (ZFP TFs) that activate the expression of the endogenous glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) gene. We show that GDNF activation can be achieved with exquisite genome-wide specificity. Furthermore, in a rat model of PD, striatal delivery of an adeno-associated viral vector serotype 2 encoding the GDNF activator resulted in improvements in forelimb akinesia, sensorimotor neglect, and amphetamine-induced rotations caused by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion. Our results suggest that an engineered ZFP TF can drive sufficient GDNF expression in the brain to provide functional neuroprotection against 6-OHDA; therefore, targeted activation of the endogenous gene may provide a method for delivering appropriate levels of GDNF to PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Both phenotype and treatment response vary in patients with Parkinson's disease. Anatomical and functional imaging studies suggest that individual symptoms may represent malfunction of different segregated networks running in parallel through the basal ganglia. In this study, we use a newly described, electrophysiological method to describe cortico-subthalamic networks in humans. We performed combined magnetoencephalographic and subthalamic local field potential recordings in thirteen patients with Parkinson's disease at rest. Two spatially and spectrally separated networks were identified. A temporoparietal-brainstem network was coherent with the subthalamic nucleus in the alpha (7-13\u2009Hz) band, whilst a predominantly frontal network was coherent in the beta (15-35\u2009Hz) band. Dopaminergic medication modulated the resting beta network, by increasing beta coherence between the subthalamic region and prefrontal cortex. Subthalamic activity was predominantly led by activity in the cortex in both frequency bands. The cortical topography and frequencies involved in the alpha and beta networks suggest that these networks may be involved in attentional and executive, particularly motor planning, processes, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), there is a significant loss of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) in addition to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). The goal of this study was to determine if the surviving LC noradrenergic neurons in PD demonstrate compensatory changes in response to the neuronal loss, as observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH) mRNA expression in postmortem LC tissue of control and age-matched PD subjects demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of noradrenergic neurons in the LC of PD subjects. TH mRNA expression/neuron did not differ between control and PD subjects, but DBH mRNA expression/neuron was significantly elevated in PD subjects compared to control. This increase in DBH mRNA expression in PD subjects is not a response to neuronal loss because the amount of DBH mRNA expression/neuron in AD subjects was not significantly different from control. Norepinephrine transporter (NET) binding site concentration in the LC of PD subjects was significantly reduced over the cell body region as well as the peri-LC dendritic zone. In PD subjects, the loss of dendrites from surviving noradrenergic neurons was also apparent with TH-immunoreactivity (IR). This loss of LC dendritic innervation in PD subjects as measured by TH-IR was not due to LC neuronal loss because TH-IR in AD subjects was robust, despite a similar loss of LC neurons. These data suggest that there is a differential response of the noradrenergic nervous system in PD compared to AD in response to the loss of LC neurons.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder of unknown cause. Some familial forms of PD are provoked by mutations in the genes encoding for the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog)-induced putative kinase-1 (PINK1) and Parkin. Mounting evidence indicates that PINK1 and Parkin might function in concert to modulate mitochondrial degradation, termed mitophagy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which PINK1/Parkin affect mitophagy are just beginning to be elucidated. Herein, we review the main advances in our understanding of the PINK1/Parkin pathway. Because of the phenotypic similarities among the different forms of PD, a better understanding of PINK1/Parkin biology might have far-reaching pathogenic and therapeutic implications for both the inherited and the sporadic forms of PD.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is thought to involve a self-sustaining cycle of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In order to develop novel anti-inflammatory therapies to break this cycle, it is crucial that the temporal relationship between neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is characterised in pre-clinical models to maximise their predictive validity. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the progression of neuroinflammation relative to nigrostriatal neurodegeneration in the two most commonly-used rat models of Parkinson's disease. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were lesioned by terminal or axonal administration of 6-hydroxydopamine, and were sacrificed for quantitative immunohistochemistry (to assess nigrostriatal integrity (anti-tyrosine hydroxylase), microgliosis (anti-OX42) and astrocytosis (anti-GFAP)) at 6 h 24 h 72 h or 2 weeks post-lesion. Following terminal lesion, dopaminergic deafferentation of the striatum was evident from 6 h post-lesion and was accompanied by microglial and astroglial activation. Dopamine neuron loss from the substantia nigra did not occur until 2 weeks after terminal lesion, and this was preceded by microglial, but not astroglial, activation. Following axonal lesion, retraction of nigrostriatal terminals from the striatum was not observed until the 72 h time-point, and this was associated with a slight astrocytosis, but not microgliosis. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra was also evident from 72 h after axonal lesion, and was accompanied by nigral microgliosis and astrocytosis by 2 weeks. This study highlights the temporal relationship between neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in models of Parkinson's disease, and should facilitate use of these models in the development of anti-inflammatory therapies for the human condition.",

    "abstract": "In this study in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), off and on dopaminergic therapy, with and without L-dopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs), we tested intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), a technique currently used for non-invasively inducing long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in primary motor cortex (M1). The study group comprised 20 PD patients on and off dopaminergic therapy (11 patients without and 9 patients with LIDs), and 14 age-matched healthy subjects. Patients had mild-to-moderate PD, and no additional neuropsychiatric disorders. We clinically evaluated patients using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS). The left M1 was conditioned with iTBS at 80% active motor threshold intensity. Twenty motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from right first interosseous muscle before and at 5, 15 and 30 min after iTBS. Between-group analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing healthy subjects versus patients with and without LIDs, on and off therapy showed a significant interaction between factors \"Group\" and \"Time\". After iTBS, MEP amplitudes in healthy subjects increased significantly at 5, 15 and 30 min (p<0.01 at all time-points) but in PD patients with and without LIDs, on and off therapy, remained unchanged. In PD patients with and without LIDs, on and off therapy iTBS fails to increase MEP responses. This finding suggests lack of iTBS-induced LTP-like plasticity in M1 in PD regardless of patients' clinical features.",

Perceptual analysis, perturbation jitter, shimmer, noise-to-harmonics ratio, and nonlinear dynamic analysis (NDA) with detrended fluctuation analysis and recurrence period density entropy were measured and compared to the above conditions. Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) was used to investigate stimulation conditions for given acoustic data.\nThe changes of perturbation measurements for the above conditions were not significant. With differences between vowels, NDA showed more significant changes and more powerful correlation with perceptual scores than perturbation measurements. NDA was significantly more sensitive during the QDA of the conditions.\nAcoustic voice analysis of sustained vowels can help with recognizing the overstimulated condition, and, with an appropriate test battery and software package including nonlinear dynamic analysis, it can be a valuable tool for fine adjustments of stimulation parameters.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are hallmarks of various neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer disease (AD), and Parkinson disease (PD). Mutations in PINK1, a mitochondrial kinase, have been linked to the occurrence of early onset parkinsonism. Currently, various studies support the notion of a neuroprotective role for PINK1, as it protects cells from stress-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Because information about the distribution pattern of PINK1 in neurological diseases other than PD is scarce, we here investigated PINK1 expression in well-characterized brain samples derived from MS and AD individuals using immunohistochemistry. In control gray matter PINK1 immunoreactivity was observed in neurons, particularly neurons in layers IV-VI. Astrocytes were the most prominent cell type decorated by anti-PINK1 antibody in the white matter. In addition, PINK1 staining was observed in the cerebrovasculature. In AD, PINK1 was found to colocalize with classic senile plaques and vascular amyloid depositions, as well as reactive astrocytes associated with the characteristic AD lesions. Interestingly, PINK1 was absent from neurofibrillary tangles. In active demyelinating MS lesions we observed a marked astrocytic PINK1 immunostaining, whereas astrocytes in chronic lesions were weakly stained. Taken together, we observed PINK1 immunostaining in both AD and MS lesions, predominantly in reactive astrocytes associated with these lesions, suggesting that the increase in astrocytic PINK1 protein might be an intrinsic protective mechanism to limit cellular injury.",

    "abstract": "Glutathione is an important antioxidant in the brain that appears to be decreased, in conjunction with mitochondrial complex I activity, in Parkinson disease patients. In postmortem analysis, measurement of glutathione levels and complex I activity can be delayed up to 20h. We investigated whether depletion of glutathione in the preweanling rat induces a reduction in complex I activity in brain mitochondria and the effects that postmortem delay has on glutathione levels and electron transport chain activity. After injection with the glutamate-cysteine ligase inhibitor, buthionine sulfoximine (L-BSO), glutathione levels were decreased by 53% compared to the control values in whole-brain homogenates. During postmortem delay of 24h, in which animals were kept at 4\u00b0C, the levels of glutathione decreased in the control group by 58% and in the L-BSO-treated group by 79%. However, during this period, there were no changes in mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I, II-III, or IV activity in either group. These results suggest that a preexisting deficiency of glutathione or a loss of glutathione during postmortem delay does not influence mitochondrial respiratory chain activity in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic availability is known to linearly decline in Parkinson's disease (PD). In contrast, temporal characteristics of serotonergic markers like the serotonin transporter (SERT) in relation to clinical staging of PD and dopaminergic cell loss are less clear. This study investigated SERT availability using [(123) I]-ADAM and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) in drug-naive, de novo patients, i.e., in a PD stage where dopaminergic decline starts to lead to the occurrence of the characteristic motor symptoms.\nNine de novo patients with PD and 9 age-matched healthy controls were studied. Measurements were repeated after 3 months of levodopa treatment in patients with PD, and dopaminergic transporter (DAT) binding was examined at baseline using [(123) I]-FP-CIT SPECT.\nNo alterations of SERT availability were found between groups, and neither correlation between SERT and DAT nor effects of levodopa treatment on SERT was found in patients with PD.\nThese preliminary findings indicate that midbrain SERT is preserved in unmedicated patients at this early stage of PD, supporting the view that serotonergic decline temporally follows dopaminergic cell loss.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairments are common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) from the early stages. Recent studies reported that medicated PD patients have poor performances, with respect to age-matched healthy controls, in a decision-making task like the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), which detects the ability to alter choice behavior in response to fluctuations in reward contingencies. The IGT principally activates functions related to the orbitofrontal cortex, which plays a crucial role in the generation of outcome expectancies and processing of rewards. The analysis of IGT performances of PD patients is of particular interest because PD represents a good clinical model to study reward processing when its neural bases are affected by a neuropathology or are overdosed by dopaminergic therapies. As a matter of fact, either PD-related neuropathology in advanced stages of the disease or the dopamine replacement therapy from earlier stages of PD may affect the functioning of the orbitofrontal cortex. Three causal hypotheses on a dysfunctional decision making in PD patients, as assessed by IGT, are discussed. Finally, the possible relation between the phenomenon of decision-making impairment and impulse control disorders, a psychiatric complication observed with increasing frequency in PD patients, is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor Pitx3 plays a crucial role in the development and survival of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons, especially the mDA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The degeneration of these neurons is the pathological hallmark in Parkinson's disease (PD). Several polymorphisms of the Pitx3 gene have been linked with sporadic and early-onset forms of PD, but different studies have given conflicting or inconsistent findings. Amongst the polymorphisms studied, the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3758549, located in the promoter region of Pitx3 gene, is one of the most well-studied but also one of the most controversial. In order to explore the nature of this association in greater detail and in a new ethnic group, we carried out a case-control study of the SNP rs3758549.\nA total of 316 patients with sporadic PD and 305 healthy controls, from two centers in mainland China, were analyzed in our study. The genotypes at rs3758549 were determined by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. And we also analyzed the association between genotype and phenotype.\nOur data showed a significant association between the rs3758549 polymorphism and PD (P = 0.012, OR = 1.50, 95%CI: 1.15-1.96). Furthermore, allele T of SNP rs3758549 was significantly more frequent in early-onset PD than in healthy controls (P < 0.001).\nOur findings indicate that the SNP rs3758549 (C >T substitution) in the Pitx3 gene is a potential risk for sporadic PD, especially early-onset PD in Chinese Han population.",

    "abstract": "The occurrences of visual hallucinations seem to be more prevalent in low light and hallucinators tend to be more prone to false positive type errors in memory tasks. Here we investigated whether the richness of stimuli does indeed affect recognition differently in hallucinating and nonhallucinating participants, and if so whether this difference extends to identifying spatial context. We compared 36 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with visual hallucinations, 32 Parkinson's patients without hallucinations, and 36 age-matched controls, on a visual memory task where color and black and white pictures were presented at different locations. Participants had to recognize the pictures among distracters along with the location of the stimulus. Findings revealed clear differences in performance between the groups. Both PD groups had impaired recognition compared to the controls, but those with hallucinations were significantly more impaired on black and white than on color stimuli. In addition, the group with hallucinations was significantly impaired compared to the other two groups on spatial memory. We suggest that not only do PD patients have poorer recognition of pictorial stimuli than controls, those who present with visual hallucinations appear to be more heavily reliant on bottom up sensory input and impaired on spatial ability.",

    "abstract": "The successful transfer of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) into patient care depends on the appropriateness of the implementation method. This study strived for a better understanding of which intervention strategy is effective in implementing the CPG on Parkinson's disease (CPG-PD). In a cluster randomized controlled trial, we compared the impact of two different implementation strategies of the CPG-PD on health outcomes of PD patients. The primary outcome of health-related quality of life was measured by PDQ-39. The neurologists of the intervention group (IG) versus a control group (CG) received the CPG-PD with special instructions, a 4-h training and were offered personal feedback. Patients were followed over three assessment times: baseline, post-test (6 months) and follow-up (9 months). Lack of time and remuneration resulted in low study participation (32 out of 619 contacted neurologists). Multilevel modelling revealed that primary (PDQ-39) and secondary efficacy variables (EQ-5D, CGI, HADS-D, ZUF-8) of 386 patients were not affected significantly by the intervention and failed to show any significant difference between the two groups. The EQ-5D VAS scale (p = 0.0288) and the CGI-P severity scale (p = 0.0072) showed a significant worsening over time. A significant decrease of hours of dyskinesias in the IG (p = 0.007) was observed, whereas Parkinson symptoms did not change significantly between the groups. Lacking awareness of the CPG-PD seems to be no longer a barrier for its use, but it is still a major challenge to find effective implementation methods to optimise clinical outcome. Further studies are needed for a more comprehensive understanding of successful implementation strategies.",

    "abstract": "It is still unclear, whether patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are impaired in the incidental learning of different motor sequences in short succession, although such a deficit might greatly impact their daily life. The aim of this study was thus to clarify the relation between disease parameters of PD and incidental motor learning of two different sequences in short succession. Results revealed that the PD patients were able to acquire two sequences in short succession but needed more time than healthy subjects. However, both the severity of axial manifestations, as assessed on a subsection of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III) and the Hoehn and Yahr score, and the levodopa-equivalent dose (LED) were negatively correlated with the sequence learning performance. These findings indicate that, although PD patients are able to learn two sequences in short succession, they need more time and their overall sequence learning performance is strongly correlated with the stage of disease.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidences suggest that the related autophagy-lysosomal mechanism plays a critical role in many neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we examined postmortem Parkinson's disease (PD) substantia nigra for evidence of cathepsin L by immunofluorescent staining, and found increased expression of cathepsin L in dopamine neurons of PD patients. We confirmed 6-OHDA induced nuclear translocation of cathepsin L in rat substantia nigral neurons as well. Furthermore, we observed autophagic vacuoles and lysosomes were accumulated in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injured rat substantia nigra neurons with electron microscopy. Immunofluorescent staining showed that LC3 was enriched in dopamine neurons after 6-OHDA treatment. When pretreated with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), dopaminergic neurons were protected from cell death induced by 6-OHDA, associated with the suppression of LC3 and cathepsin L. Our results demonstrate that activation of autophagy and abnormal distribution of cathepsin L may be responsible for dopamine neuron death, involved in the pathogenic cascade event for the development of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "To describe the prevalence, phenomenology and correlates of 'impulse control disorders' (ICDs) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with dopamine replacement therapy (DRT); to assess the strength of the evidence that DRT plays a contributory causal role in these disorders; and to highlight the implications of these disorders for research in the addiction field.\nPubMed and Web of Science databases were searched and the reference lists of papers examined.\nThe prevalence of ICDs in Parkinson's patients using DRT varied between 3.5% and 13.6%, depending on the severity and range of disorders assessed. PD patients with ICDs were: generally younger; had an earlier onset of PD; had a personal or family history of substance abuse or an ICD; and were more likely to be treated with dopamine receptor agonists (DA agonists) than levodopa (l-dopa). There is reasonable evidence that dopaminergic medications play a causal role in ICDs in that they occur at a higher rate in an otherwise low-risk population of adults, begin after initiation of DA agonist therapy and cease upon its discontinuation. A causal relationship is biologically plausible, but the role of other factors (such as concurrent mood disorders) remain to be clarified by better-controlled studies.\nImpulse control disorders among patients with Parkinson's disease receiving dopamine replacement therapy may provide a unique opportunity for addiction researchers to study the neurobiology of impulsive forms of behaviour (such as problem gambling) that appear to be caused, in part, by the therapeutic use of dopamine receptor agonists.",

    "abstract": "Glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3B) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) are the 2 major protein kinases involved in abnormal phosphorylation of tau. To determine their potential role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) we analyzed 2 functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GSK3B (rs334558 and rs6438552) and rs735555 of CDK5 regulatory subunit 1 (CDK5R1) in 373 PD cases and 346 healthy controls of eastern India. The C,C and T,C haplotypes of GSK3B were respectively moderately associated with increased risk and protection for late onset PD (LOPD) (odds ratio [OR], 1.399; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.069-1.829; p = 0.015, and OR, 0.436; 95% CI, 0.222-0.853; p = 0.016, respectively). Moreover, moderate to significant interaction between different loci were observed for the entire PD cohort or late onset PD only. However, among these interactions, individuals carrying the (C/C) genotype at both loci (rs6438552 and rs735555) had almost twice the risk of developing PD than those without this genotypic combination (OR, 1.871; 95% CI, 1.181-2.964; p = 0.009). Thus, synergistic effect between the 2 major tau kinases, through these SNPs, appears to determine the risk profile for PD.",

    "abstract": "To investigate clinical, demographic and dietary factors associated with constipation in a sample of community dwelling people with Parkinson's disease, recruited through a specialist outpatient clinic. Partners/carers provided a convenience control group.\nParticipants completed a baseline questionnaire (background information, diet and exercise, activities of daily living: mobility and manual dexterity, health-related quality of life (SF-12), stool frequency and characteristics, extent of concern due to constipation, laxative taking), and a four-week stool diary. The Rome criterion was used to determine constipation status. Multiple regression methods were used to explore the correlates of constipation. Baseline data were provided by 121 people with Parkinson's, (54 controls), of whom 73% (25%) met the Rome criterion. Prospective diary data from 106 people with Parkinson's (43 controls) showed lower proportions: 35% (7%) meeting the Rome criterion. Among all study subjects, i.e. Parkinson's patients and controls taken together, the presence of constipation is predicted by having Parkinson's disease (p\u00a0=\u00a0.003; odds ratio 4.80, 95% CI 1.64-14.04) and mobility score (p\u00a0=\u00a0.04; odds ratio 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.31), but not by dietary factors. Amongst people with Parkinson's constipation is predicted by number of medications (p\u00a0=\u00a0.027). Laxative taking masks constipation, and is significantly associated with wearing protection against bowel incontinence (p\u00a0=\u00a0.009; odds ratio 4.80, 95% CI: 1.48-15.52).\nConstipation is disease-related, not a lifestyle factor. More research is needed on optimal management and laxative use.",

    "abstract": "The development of L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) remains a major problem in the long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to assess the effect of the multitargeting molecule BN82451 on LID and to measure striatal mRNA expression of several genes in a rat model of PD. Rats were administered two unilateral injections of 6-OHDA in the striatum. After four weeks, the animals started a chronic daily treatment with increasing doses of L-dopa over a further four-week period. Over the course of L-dopa treatment, the rats developed abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) classified as locomotive, axial, orolingual and forelimb dyskinesia. In animals rendered dyskinetic by L-dopa, administration of BN82451 at doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg p.o. attenuated the severity of fully-established AIMs in a dose-related manner. This anti-dyskinetic effect could be achieved with lower doses of BN82451 administered sub chronically vs. acute single treatment. The improvement of AIMs is not due to a reduction in the general motor activity of dyskinetic rats. BN82451 treatment significantly reversed the overexpression of c-Fos, FosB and Arc mRNA associated with the dyskinesiogenic action of L-dopa. A significant correlation between the degree of overexpression of c-Fos, FosB and Arc mRNA and the dyskinesiogenic action of L-dopa was observed. The data demonstrate that BN82451 effectively attenuates LID and the associated molecular alterations in an animal model of PD and may represent a treatment option for managing dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait is a common, debilitating feature of Parkinson's disease. We have studied gait planning in patients with freezing of gait, using motor imagery of walking in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging. This approach exploits the large neural overlap that exists between planning and imagining a movement. In addition, it avoids confounds introduced by brain responses to altered motor performance and somatosensory feedback during actual freezing episodes. We included 24 patients with Parkinson's disease: 12 patients with freezing of gait, 12 matched patients without freezing of gait and 21 matched healthy controls. Subjects performed two previously validated tasks--motor imagery of gait and a visual imagery control task. During functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, we quantified imagery performance by measuring the time required to imagine walking on paths of different widths and lengths. In addition, we used voxel-based morphometry to test whether between-group differences in imagery-related activity were related to structural differences. Imagery times indicated that patients with freezing of gait, patients without freezing of gait and controls engaged in motor imagery of gait, with matched task performance. During motor imagery of gait, patients with freezing of gait showed more activity than patients without freezing of gait in the mesencephalic locomotor region. Patients with freezing of gait also tended to have decreased responses in mesial frontal and posterior parietal regions. Furthermore, patients with freezing of gait had grey matter atrophy in a small portion of the mesencephalic locomotor region. The gait-related hyperactivity of the mesencephalic locomotor region correlated with clinical parameters (freezing of gait severity and disease duration), but not with the degree of atrophy. These results indicate that patients with Parkinson's disease with freezing of gait have structural and functional alterations in the mesencephalic locomotor region. We suggest that freezing of gait might emerge when altered cortical control of gait is combined with a limited ability of the mesencephalic locomotor region to react to that alteration. These limitations might become particularly evident during challenging events that require precise regulation of step length and gait timing, such as turning or initiating walking, which are known triggers for freezing of gait.",

In the current study, we used functional MRI (fMRI) and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) methods to investigate the changes in effective connectivity of the brain networks during performance of self-initiated movement in PD patients. Effective connectivity is defined as the influence one neuronal system exerts over another. fMRIs were acquired in 18 PD patients and in 18 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, when performing a self-initiated right hand tapping task. We chose the left primary motor cortex (M1), rostral supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), left premotor cortex (PMC), left putamen, and right cerebellum as index areas for PPI analysis. During the performance of self-initiated movement, connectivity between the putamen and M1, PMC, SMA, and cerebellum was decreased in PD patients compared to controls. In contrast, connections between the M1, pre-SMA, PMC, parietal cortex, and cerebellum were increased in PD patients compared to controls. In addition, the M1, pre-SMA, PMC, and cerebellum also had less connectivity with the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex in PD. In PD patients, the effective connectivity between the putamen and M1, PMC, SMA, and cerebellum negatively correlated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores; whereas the connectivity between the M1, pre-SMA, PMC, and cerebellum positively correlated with the UPDRS motor scores. Our findings demonstrate that the pattern of interactions of brain networks is disrupted in PD during performance of self-initiated movements. The striatum-cortical and striatum-cerebellar connections are weakened. In contrast, the connections between cortico-cerebellar motor regions are strengthened and may compensate for basal ganglia dysfunction. These altered interregional connections are more deviant when the disorder is more severe, and, therefore, our results give further insight into the explanation for the difficulty in performing self-initiated movements in PD.",

    "abstract": "Since the 1980 s, when cell transplantation into the brain as a cure for Parkinson's disease hit the headlines, several patients with Parkinson's disease have received transplantation of cells from aborted fetuses with the aim of replacing the dopamine cells destroyed by the disease. The results in human studies were unpredictable and raised controversy. Some patients showed remarkable improvement, but many of the patients who underwent transplantation experienced serious disabling adverse reactions, putting an end to human trials since the late 1990 s. These side effects consisted of patients' developing troublesome involuntary, uncontrolled movements in the absence of dopaminergic medication, so-called off-phase, graft-induced dyskinesias. Notwithstanding the several mechanisms having been proposed, the pathogenesis of this type of dyskinesias remained unclear and there was no effective treatment. It has been suggested that graft-induced dyskinesias could be related to fiber outgrowth from the graft causing increased dopamine release, that could be related to the failure of grafts to restore a precise distribution of dopaminergic synaptic contacts on host neurons or may also be induced by inflammatory and immune responses around the graft. A recent study, however, hypothesized that an important factor for the development of graft-induced dyskinesias could include the composition of the cell suspension and specifically that a high proportion of serotonergic neurons cografted in these transplants engage in nonphysiological properties such as false transmitter release. The findings from this study showed serotonergic hyperinnervation in the grafted striatum of two patients with Parkinson's disease who exhibited major motor recovery after transplantation with fetal mesencephalic tissue but later developed graft-induced dyskinesias. Moreover, the dyskinesias were significantly attenuated by administration of a serotonin agonist, which activates the inhibitory serotonin autoreceptors and attenuates transmitter release from serotonergic neurons, indicating that graft-induced dyskinesias were caused by the dense serotonergic innervation engaging in false transmitter release. Here the implications of the recent findings for the development of new human trials testing the safety and efficacy of cell transplantation in patients with Parkinson's disease are discussed.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This work reviews the evidence of the mechanism of neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the neuroprotective effect of lipoic acid and its use in the treatment of PD. PD is characterized by slow and progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to reduction of the striatal dopaminergic terminals. It is known that several factors influence neuronal damage. Among these factors, oxidative stress, immune system activity, microglial cells, and apoptotic mechanisms are of major importance. Currently, several antioxidants have been studied with the aim of reducing/slowing the progression of neurodegenerative processes. Lipoic acid is considered a universal antioxidant because it is an amphipathic substance. Lipoic acid and its reduced form, dihidrolipoic acid, act against reactive oxygen species, reducing oxidative stress. Therefore, this antioxidant has been used in the treatment of many diseases, including a new perspective for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of depressive symptoms and its correlation with the quality of life among cognitively intact, community dwelling Filipino patients with Parkinson disease (PD) not treated pharmacologically for depression. In this prospective, cross-sectional study 76 PD patients were included. Demographic data were obtained including: age, gender, onset of disease, disease duration, and medication intake. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was performed to exclude significant cognitive impairment. The Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was administered to quantify the degree of depressive symptoms. The degree of depressive symptoms was correlated with the SF 36 and UPDRS Parts II and III. Our cohort of patients had a mean age of 61 years (range: 42-81 years), and disease duration of 2.7 years (33 months); 46 (61%) experienced significant depressive symptoms based on the MADRS cutoff score of >14. Depressive symptoms were associated with poorer performance on both UPDRS Parts II and III and SF 36. Untreated depressive symptoms among Filipinos with PD may be higher compared to other PD populations but prospective and age-matched controlled studies will need to be performed to confirm these preliminary observations. The presence of depressive symptoms was significantly correlated with poorer quality of life and level of functioning.",

Gene multiplication can cause inherited PD, and promoter polymorphisms that increase SNCA expression are associated with sporadic PD. CpG methylation in the promoter region may also influence SNCA expression.\nBy using cultured cells, we identified a region of the SNCA CpG island in which the methylation status altered along with increased SNCA expression. Postmortem brain analysis revealed regional non-specific methylation differences in this CpG region in the anterior cingulate and putamen among controls and PD; however, in the substantia nigra of PD, methylation was significantly decreased.\nThis CpG region may function as an intronic regulatory element for SNCA gene. Our findings suggest that a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism controlling SNCA expression influences PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine A(2a) receptor antagonists reduce symptom severity in Parkinson disease (PD) and animal models. Rodent studies support the hypothesis that A(2a) antagonists produce this benefit by reducing the inhibitory output of the basal ganglia indirect pathway. One way to test this hypothesis in humans is to quantify regional pharmacodynamic responses with cerebral blood flow (CBF) imaging. That approach has also been proposed as a tool to accelerate pharmaceutical dose finding, but has not yet been applied in humans to drugs in development. We successfully addressed both these aims with a perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the novel adenosine A(2a) antagonist SYN115. During a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 21 PD patients on levodopa but no agonists, we acquired pulsed arterial spin labeling MRI at the end of each treatment period. SYN115 produced a highly significant decrease in thalamic CBF, consistent with reduced pallidothalamic inhibition via the indirect pathway. Similar decreases occurred in cortical regions whose activity decreases with increased alertness and externally focused attention, consistent with decreased self-reported sleepiness on SYN115. Remarkably, we also derived quantitative pharmacodynamic parameters from the CBF responses to SYN115. These results suggested that the doses tested were on the low end of the effective dose range, consistent with clinical data reported separately. We conclude that (1) SYN115 enters the brain and exerts dose-dependent regional effects, (2) the most prominent of these effects is consistent with deactivation of the indirect pathway as predicted by preclinical studies; and (3) perfusion MRI can provide rapid, quantitative, clinically relevant dose-finding information for pharmaceutical development.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate psychometric properties (convergent and divergent validity; alternate forms reliability) and provide normative data for the Alternating Names Test (ANT), a new bedside test of set-switching, a component of executive function (EF). The test was specifically designed for use in persons with Parkinson disease (PD).\nCross-sectional study.\nClinic-based PD Research Registry.\nData were gathered from two samples: 829 patients with idiopathic PD enrolled in our clinic registry and 253 caregivers and family members of patients.\nIn the ANT, patients are asked to produce the names of children, switching back and forth from boys' to girls' names. Outcome measures include the time to complete ten correct pairs and the number of errors made.\nCorrelations between the ANT and similar constructs were high (mean Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient, rho=.67), indicating good convergent validity. Measures of divergent validity were low (mean Spearman's rho=.31), demonstrating good divergent validity. Alternate forms reliability was high for time (rho=.76), but low for errors (rho=.37). Normative data are presented in a look-up table.\nOur test is a valid and reliable measure of set-switching in PD. Its ease of administration and effectiveness in identifying executive deficits suggests that the test could be useful in clinical practice and warrants further study.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal oscillations are assumed to play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) generate oscillations which are coupled to rhythmic population activity both in other basal ganglia nuclei and cortical areas. In order to localize these cortical areas, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) simultaneously in PD patients undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation (DBS). Patients were withdrawn from antiparkinsonian medication and recorded at rest. We scanned the entire brain for oscillations coherent with LFPs recorded from the STN with a frequency domain beamformer. Coherent activity in the low (12-20 Hz) and high (20-35 Hz) beta range was found in the ipsilateral sensorimotor and the premotor cortex. Coherence in the alpha range (7-12 Hz) was observed at various locations in the ipsilateral temporal lobe. In a subset of subjects, the superior temporal gyrus consistently showed coherent alpha oscillations. Our findings provide new insights into patterns of frequency-specific functional connectivity between basal ganglia and cortex and suggest that simultaneous inter-regional interactions may be segregated in the frequency domain. Furthermore, they demonstrate that simultaneous MEG-LFP recordings are a powerful tool to study interactions between brain areas in PD patients undergoing surgery for DBS.",

    "abstract": "Recent findings from genetic studies suggest that defective mitochondrial quality control may play an important role in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Such defects may result in the impairment of neuronal mitochondria, which leads to both synaptic dysfunction and cell death and results in neurodegeneration.

    "abstract": "Hyposmia is one of the early signs in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Olfactory stimuli were applied during fMRI scanning to show disease-related modulation of central nervous system structures and to advance our understanding of olfactory dysfunction in PD patients. All participants received either unpleasant stimuli that smelled like rotten eggs or pleasant ones that smelled like roses. Using a block design at a 1.5 T scanner we investigated a total of 8 PD patients (mean age 60\u2009\u00b1\u200910.9\u2009years) and 13 age matched controls (mean age 58\u2009\u00b1\u20099.6\u2009years). PD duration ranged from 1 to 9\u2009years (mean 6.63\u2009years); patients had an average \"Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III\" score of 23.25 (range, 6-46). Olfactory function was established using the \"Sniffin' Sticks\" test battery. Patients tended to rate the stimuli presented during fMRI scans as less intense, but also as more pleasant than controls. fMRI results revealed differences between PD patients and controls which depended on the type of stimulation. While both pleasant and unpleasant stimulation was associated with lower activation in the amygdalo-hippocampal complex in patients compared to controls, increased activity in response to pleasant stimuli was observed in the striatum and the left inferior frontal gyrus. In contrast, unpleasant stimulation led to hypoactivation of the ventral striatum in patients (but not in controls) and did not enhance left inferior frontal activity. These results may partly reflect differences between PD patients and healthy controls in the processing of primary dimensions of odors, intensity, and valence.",

    "abstract": "The coordination between locomotion and respiration of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients is reduced or even absent. The degree of this disturbance is assumed to be associated with the disease severity [S. Schiermeier, D. Sch\u00e4fer, T. Sch\u00e4fer, W. Greulich, and M. E. Schl\u00e4fke, \"Breathing and locomotion in patients with Parkinson's disease,\" Eur. J. Physiol., vol. 443, No. 1, pp. 67-71, Jul. 2001]. To enable a long-term and online analysis of the locomotion-respiration coordination for scientific purpose, we have developed a distributed wireless communicating network. We aim to integrate biofeedback protocols with the real-time analysis of the locomotion-respiration coordination in the system to aid rehabilitation of PD patients. The network of sensor nodes is composed of intelligent network operating devices (iNODEs). The miniaturized iNODE contains a continuous data acquisition system based on microcontroller, local data storage, capability of on-sensor digital signal processing in real time, and wireless communication based on IEEE 802.15.4. Force sensing resistors and respiratory inductive plethysmography are applied for motion and respiration sensing, respectively. A number of experiments have been undertaken in clinic and laboratory to test the system. It shall facilitate identification of therapeutic effects on PD, allowing to measure the patients' health status, and to aid in the rehabilitation of PD patients.",

The most often ocular diseases, symptoms and the bioelectrical dysfunction were diagnosed using routine ophthalmological examination including tear film tests, perimetry, optical coherence tomography (OCT), color and contrast sensitivity tests, and electrophysiological recordings like EOGs, flash, pattern and multifocal ERGs, VEPs.\nThe most frequent ocular diseases in PD are dry eye syndrome and glaucoma. At least 25% of PD patients manifest visual hallucinations. The most prominent bioelectrical dysfunction of the visual pathway was observed in outer layers of the retina (retinal pigmented epithelium, phoptreceptors) and it was registered mainly in EOG, PERG and mfERG tests.\nDuring examination of PD patents, general ophthalmologists should especially pay attention to diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma and dry eye syndrome. In PD visual deficits may occur without any noticeable changes in the routine ophthalmological examination. Electrophysiological recordings can explain, at least partially, visual dysfunction in course of PD.",

    "abstract": "We have recently identified a neuroprotective role for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) in a toxin-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Combined with epidemiological data, these observations suggest that low n-3 PUFA intake is a modifiable environmental risk factor for PD. In order to strengthen these preclinical findings as prerequisite to clinical trials, we further investigated the neuroprotective role of n-3 PUFAs in Fat-1 mice, a transgenic model expressing an n-3 fatty acid desaturase converting n-6 PUFAs into n-3 PUFAs. Here, we report that the expression of the fat-1 transgene increased cortical n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio (+28%), but to a lesser extent than dietary supplementation (92%). Such a limited endogenous production of n-3 PUFAs in the Fat-1 mouse was insufficient to confer neuroprotection against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine neurotoxicity as assessed by dopamine levels, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons and fibers, as well as nigral Nurr1 and dopamine transporter (DAT) mRNA expression. Nevertheless, higher cortical docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) concentrations were positively correlated with markers of nigral dopaminergic neurons such as the number of TH-positive cells, in addition to Nurr1 and DAT mRNA levels. These associations are consistent with the protective role of DHA in a mouse model of PD. Taken together, these data suggest that dietary intake of a preformed DHA supplement is more effective in reaching the brain and achieving neuroprotection in an animal model of PD.",

    "abstract": "Measuring the quality of health care is a fundamental step toward improving health care and is increasingly used in pay-for-performance initiatives and maintenance of certification requirements. Measure development to date has focused on primary care and common conditions such as diabetes; thus, the number of measures that apply to neurologic care is limited. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) identified the need for neurologists to develop measures of neurologic care and to establish a process to accomplish this.\nTo adapt and test the feasibility of a process for independent development by the AAN of measures for neurologic conditions for national measurement programs.\nA process that has been used nationally for measure development was adapted for use by the AAN. Topics for measure development are chosen based upon national priorities, available evidence base from a systematic literature search, gaps in care, and the potential impact for quality improvement. A panel composed of subject matter and measure development methodology experts oversees the development of the measures. Recommendation statements and their corresponding level of evidence are reviewed and considered for development into draft candidate measures. The candidate measures are refined by the expert panel during a 30-day public comment period and by review by the American Medical Association for Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) II codes. All final AAN measures are approved by the AAN Board of Directors.\nParkinson disease (PD) was chosen for measure development. A review of the medical literature identified 258 relevant recommendation statements. A 28-member panel approved 10 quality measures for PD that included full specifications and CPT II codes.\nThe AAN has adapted a measure development process that is suitable for national measurement programs and has demonstrated its capability to independently develop quality measures.",

    "abstract": "The LRRK2(G2019S) mutation is the most common identifiable cause for Parkinson disease (PD), but the underlying mechanisms leading to neuronal cell death remain largely unclear. Impaired mitochondrial function and morphology have been described in different in vivo and in vitro model systems of early-onset PD (EOPD) as well as in EOPD patient tissue. The aim of our study was to assess mitochondrial function and morphology in LRRK2(G2019S) mutant patient tissue to determine whether impaired mitochondrial function and morphology are shared features in early-onset and late-onset PD.\nSkin biopsies were taken from 5 patients with PD with the LRRK2(G2019S) mutation. Assessment of mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular ATP levels as well as substrate-linked mitochondrial ATP production assays were all carried out on 3 independent cell preparations per patient. Results were compared to 5 age-matched controls. Mitochondrial elongation and interconnectivity was assessed using previously published methods.\nBoth mitochondrial membrane potential and total intracellular ATP levels were decreased in the G2019S mutation carriers. Subsequently undertaken mitochondrial ATP production assays suggested that the observed reduction is at least partially due to impaired mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial elongation and interconnectivity were increased in the LRRK2(G2019S) patient cohort.\nOur results provide evidence for impaired mitochondrial function and morphology in LRRK2(G2019S) mutant patient tissue. Further studies are required to determine whether the impaired mitochondrial function is due to increased LRRK2 kinase activity or other mechanisms such as LRRK2 haploinsufficiency.",

    "abstract": "To explore the neuroanatomic basis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD; aMCI-PD(+)) and without PD (aMCI-PD(-)).\nA total of 119 patients with aMCI (aMCI-PD(-), n = 78, and aMCI-PD(+), n = 41) underwent T1-weighted MRI, and the image data were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry.\nNo significant differences in demographic characteristics or general cognition were found between patients with aMCI-PD(-) and aMCI-PD(+). Comparisons of neuropsychological tests between groups revealed that patients with aMCI-PD(-) had lower scores in delayed verbal and visual recognition memory, whereas visuospatial dysfunction was more severe in patients with aMCI-PD(+). Gray matter (GM) density in the right temporal and posterior cingular cortices was significantly lower in the aMCI-PD(-) group compared with controls. In contrast, GM density in the aMCI-PD(+) group was significantly lower in the precuneus and left prefrontal and primary motor areas relative to controls. A direct comparison between groups showed that decreased GM density in aMCI-PD(-) relative to aMCI-PD(+) was localized in the right temporal and anterior prefrontal areas, whereas decreased GM density in aMCI-PD(+) relative to aMCI-PD(-) was involved in the bilateral precuneus, left primary motor, and right parietal areas. Memory decline was correlated with temporal area atrophy in aMCI-PD(-) and with posterior cingulate cortex atrophy in aMCI-PD(+).\nOur data suggest that different neuroanatomic systems underlie memory dysfunction in patients with aMCI-PD(-) and aMCI-PD(+).",

    "results": "No significant differences in demographic characteristics or general cognition were found between patients with aMCI-PD(-) and aMCI-PD(+). Comparisons of neuropsychological tests between groups revealed that patients with aMCI-PD(-) had lower scores in delayed verbal and visual recognition memory, whereas visuospatial dysfunction was more severe in patients with aMCI-PD(+). Gray matter (GM) density in the right temporal and posterior cingular cortices was significantly lower in the aMCI-PD(-) group compared with controls. In contrast, GM density in the aMCI-PD(+) group was significantly lower in the precuneus and left prefrontal and primary motor areas relative to controls. A direct comparison between groups showed that decreased GM density in aMCI-PD(-) relative to aMCI-PD(+) was localized in the right temporal and anterior prefrontal areas, whereas decreased GM density in aMCI-PD(+) relative to aMCI-PD(-) was involved in the bilateral precuneus, left primary motor, and right parietal areas. Memory decline was correlated with temporal area atrophy in aMCI-PD(-) and with posterior cingulate cortex atrophy in aMCI-PD(+).",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), neurodegenerative changes have been observed in autonomic pathways involving multiple organ systems. We explore pupillary and cardiac autonomic measures as physiological manifestations of PD neurodegeneration.\nPupil measures (pupillary unrest (spontaneous changes of pupil diameter in darkness), constriction velocity and redilation velocity) were assessed in 35 participants (17 PD, 18 controls). Simultaneous cardiac measures (respiratory sinus arrythmia during deep breathing, Valsalva ratio, resting heart rate variability (HRV), orthostatic change in blood pressure and orthostatic change in heart rate) were obtained. Nonparametric statistics were used to compare PD with control participants and to calculate correlation coefficients between pupillary and cardiac measures.\nPupillary unrest and orthostatic decreases in systolic blood pressure were greater in PD than controls. Respiratory sinus arrythmia during deep breathing and resting HRV were lower in PD. Among all participants, there was a negative correlation between HRV and redilation velocity and a positive correlation between orthostatic change in heart rate and pupillary unrest. A modifying effect of PD was found on the association between high frequency HRV and pupillary unrest.\nResults demonstrate simultaneous autonomic dysfunction in both pupillary and cardiac systems in PD. The correlations between pupillary and cardiac measures suggest shared central centers of autonomic integration, while the modifying effect of PD may reflect autonomic effects of PD-related pathology not present in controls.",

    "abstract": "Excessive and abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-synuclein) is a factor contributing to pathogenic cell death in Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this study, based on earlier observations of Parkinson's disease cerebrospinal fluid (PD-CSF) initiated cell death, was to determine the effects of CSF from PD patients on the functionally different microglia and astrocyte glial cell lines. Microglia cells from human glioblastoma and astrocytes from fetal brain tissue were cultured, grown to confluence, treated with fixed concentrations of PD-CSF, non-PD disease control CSF, or control no-CSF medium, then photographed and fluorescently probed for \u03b1-synuclein content by deconvolution fluorescence microscopy. Outcome measures included manually counted cell growth patterns from day 1-8; \u03b1-synuclein density and distribution by antibody tagged 3D model stacked deconvoluted fluorescent imaging.\nAfter PD-CSF treatment, microglia growth was reduced extensively, and a non-confluent pattern with morphological changes developed, that was not evident in disease control CSF and no-CSF treated cultures. Astrocyte growth rates were similarly reduced by exposure to PD-CSF, but morphological changes were not consistently noted. PD-CSF treated microglia showed a significant increase in \u03b1-synuclein content by day 4 compared to other treatments (p \u2264 0.02). In microglia only, \u03b1-synuclein aggregated and redistributed to peri-nuclear locations.\nCultured microglia and astrocytes are differentially affected by PD-CSF exposure compared to non-PD-CSF controls. PD-CSF dramatically impacts microglia cell growth, morphology, and \u03b1-synuclein deposition compared to astrocytes, supporting the hypothesis of cell specific susceptibility to PD-CSF toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Patient telephone calls are a major form of unreimbursed healthcare utilization in Parkinson's disease (PD), yet little is known about potential risk factors for frequent calling behavior.\nProspective cohort study of 175 non-demented outpatients with PD. Our primary outcome measure was the frequency of patient telephone calls over a three-month period relative to baseline demographics, State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scores, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores, and medication use. Based on the median call rate (1 call/3 months), subjects were dichotomized into frequent (\u22652 calls) and infrequent (\u22641 call) caller groups.\nA total of 297 calls were received, of which 264 (89%) were from the frequent caller group (n\u00a0=\u00a063 subjects), and only 33 (11%) were from the infrequent caller group (n\u00a0=\u00a0112 subjects). Compared with calls from infrequent callers, those from frequent callers more commonly related to somatic symptoms of PD (46.8% vs. 19.4%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of frequent calling were: anxiety (STAI \u226555; adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a02.62, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), sleep disorders (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a02.36, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), dyskinesias (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a03.07, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and dopamine agonist use (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a02.27, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Baseline demographics, UPDRS motor scores, and levodopa use were similar in both groups.\nFrequent patient telephone calls in PD are independently associated with anxiety, sleep disorders, dyskinesias, and dopamine agonist use, with a minority of patients accounting for the majority of calls. Aggressive treatment of these non-motor symptoms and motor complications might potentially reduce the burden of patient telephone calls in PD.",

    "abstract": "The optimal age and disease duration for consideration of deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery are not well characterized in patients with Parkinson disease. The aim of this study was to assess variation in motor response to surgery among subgroups stratified by age and disease duration.\nA total of 46 patients referred for DBS were recruited for the study. Preoperative dyskinesia and rigidity scores were recorded, and then patients received bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation. Preoperative motor scores were then compared with postoperative scores over 1 year.\nAt 1 year postoperatively, patients with \u2264 10 years' disease duration showed a significant (45%) reduction in rigidity and a significant (64%) reduction in dyskinesia. Patients with > 10 years disease also showed a significant (70%) reduction in dyskinesia at 1 year postoperatively, but failed to show significant improvement in rigidity (31% reduction). Patients < 70 years old showed a significant (58%) improvement in rigidity and a significant (53%) improvement in dyskinesia. Finally, patients \u2265 70 years old showed a significant (90%) improvement in dyskinesia, but failed to show any significant change in rigidity at 1 year postoperatively.\nThe postoperative improvement in rigidity for younger patients with shorter disease duration may indicate that performing early surgery maximizes the benefit of DBS. However, older patients with primarily dyskinesia symptoms also appear to have significant clinical improvement, and DBS can offer relief from this common consequence of long-term levodopa use.",

    "abstract": "In vivo and post-mortem studies have demonstrated that increased nigral iron content in patients with Parkinson's disease is a prominent pathophysiological feature. However, the mechanism and risk factors associated with nigral iron deposition in patients with Parkinson's disease have not been identified and represent a key challenge in understanding its pathogenesis and for its diagnosis. In this study, we assessed iron levels in patients with Parkinson's disease and in age- and gender-matched control subjects by measuring phase values using magnetic resonance based susceptibility-weighted phase imaging in a 3T magnetic resonance system. Phase values were measured from brain regions including bilateral substantia nigra, globus pallidus, putamen, caudate, thalamus, red nucleus and frontal white matter of 45 patients with Parkinson's disease with decreased or normal serum ceruloplasmin levels, together with age- and gender-matched control subjects. Correlative analyses between phase values, serum ceruloplasmin levels and disease severity showed that the nigral bilateral average phase values in patients with Parkinson's disease were significantly lower than in control subjects and correlated with disease severity according to the Hoehn and Yahr Scale. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores from the clinically most affected side were significantly correlated with the phase values of the contralateral substantia nigra. Furthermore, nigral bilateral average phase values correlated highly with the level of serum ceruloplasmin. Specifically, in the subset of patients with Parkinson's disease exhibiting reduced levels of serum ceruloplasmin, we found lowered nigral bilateral average phase values, suggesting increased nigral iron content, while those patients with normal levels of serum ceruloplasmin exhibited no changes as compared with control subjects. These findings suggest that decreased levels of serum ceruloplasmin may specifically exacerbate nigral iron deposition in patients with Parkinson's disease. Combining susceptibility-weighted phase imaging with serum ceruloplasmin determination is likely to be useful for the diagnosis and assessment of a subset of patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by motor and cognitive problems that are accompanied by slowing of neural activity. This study examined the relationship between neural slowing and disease severity during rest and motor performance.\nPrimary motor activity was assessed by means of magnetoencephalography during rest and rhythmic movements. Motor output and event-related cortical power in the alpha and beta frequency bands were determined. UPDRS total and subscores were used to pinpoint correlates of neural slowing (change of power towards lower frequencies) during both resting state and the production of rhythmic movements.\nBy design, motor performance was similar for both the patients and the controls. PD patients showed slowing of neural activity which increased with disease severity. Slowing during rest showed the clearest correlation with cognitive UPDRS subscores, whereas slowing during movement correlated best with the motor UPDRS subscore.\nThese results suggest that slowing is functionally modulated and that different mechanisms are responsible for neural slowing during rest versus movement.\nNeural slowing must be viewed in a broader context than previously thought because it is not solely related to impaired motor performance but also to impaired cognition.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenesis, the production of new neurons from less differentiated precursor cells, normally occurs in adult brains in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Neurogenesis declines with aging. In previous studies, neurogenesis was stimulated by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride (MPTP) in young animals. In this study, we examined the effect of acute MPTP administration and mutant \u03b1-synuclein A53T on neurogenesis and migration of newborn neurons in the aged (23-month) vs. young (2-month) rodent brain. Cell proliferation and neurogenesis were assessed via bromodeoxyuridine labeling and immunostaining for cell type-specific markers. In the aged brain, neural precursor cells in the rostral SVZ retained the capacity for proliferation and migration in response to MPTP-induced Parkinsonism, although the response is less robust than in younger animals. Furthermore, in transgenic mice that overexpress mutant \u03b1-synuclein (A53T), brains examined day 21 after MPTP administration showed markedly decreased olfactory bulb and substantia nigra neurogenesis. Our data suggest that in addition to aging effects associated with decline in the number of newly generated cells, mutant \u03b1-synuclein reduces MPTP-induced neurogenesis. This could provide a novel therapeutic target for chronic brain repair in this condition.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons are selectively vulnerable to oxidative stress and inflammatory attack. The neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra is associated with a glial response composed markedly of activated microglia and, to a lesser extent, of reactive astrocytes although these glial responses may be the source of neurotrophic factors and can protect against oxidative stress such as reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. However, the glial response can also mediate a variety of deleterious events related to the production of pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant reactive species, prostaglandins, cytokines, and so on. In this review, we discuss the possible protective and deleterious effects of glial cells in the neurodegenerative diseases and examine how these factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. This review suggests that further investigation concerning glial reaction in Parkinson's disease may lead to disease-modifying therapeutic approaches and may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease.",

    "abstract": "The umbilical cord provides a rich source of primitive mesenchymal stem cells (human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUMSCs)), which have the potential for transplantation-based treatments of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Our pervious study indicated that adenovirus-associated virus-mediated intrastriatal delivery of human vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF 165) conferred molecular protection to the dopaminergic system. As both VEGF and HUMSCs displayed limited neuroprotection, in this study we investigated whether HUMSCs combined with VEGF expression could offer enhanced neuroprotection. HUMSCs were modified by adenovirus-mediated VEGF gene transfer, and subsequently transplanted into rotenone-lesioned striatum of hemiparkinsonian rats. As a result, HUMSCs differentiated into dopaminergic neuron-like cells on the basis of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) (neuronal marker), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (astrocyte marker), nestin (neural stem cell marker) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (dopaminergic marker) expression. Further, VEGF expression significantly enhanced the dopaminergic differentiation of HUMSCs in vivo. HUMSC transplantation ameliorated apomorphine-evoked rotations and reduced the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the lesioned substantia nigra (SNc), which was enhanced significantly by VEGF expression in HUMSCs. These findings present the suitability of HUMSC as a vector for gene therapy and suggest that stem cell engineering with VEGF may improve the transplantation strategy for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Pathophysiologically the illness is due to a disruption of dopamine production in the basal ganglia and leads to a wide array of symptoms. These symptoms are not restricted to the nervous system; thus, the illness often presents acutely to a wide range of specialties, many of which may have limited experience in the condition. Patients often become unwell with illnesses unrelated to their PD. However, these conditions frequently lead to a deterioration in PD control. In addition, there exist certain acute complications of PD which are often difficult to recognise and carry significant mortality. Discussing the acute presentations of the illness under the umbrella of PD is important as it enables clinicians to focus upon the specific concerns involved in managing patients with the illness. A number of conditions are extremely common in PD and include falls, orthostatic hypotension, swallowing difficulties, psychosis, and hyperkinetic movement disorders. Optimal treatment of these conditions requires the consideration of issues specific to PD. Lesser recognised acute presentations of PD include the serotonin syndrome and neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome. While encountered less commonly, these conditions have been well described in the literature and untreated may prove fatal. They require urgent management, with their importance being further highlighted by the fact they may often mimic other illnesses, making diagnosis difficult. Therapeutic interventions aimed at treating PD and preventing its complications are evolving rapidly.",

    "abstract": "Gait and cognitive disturbances are common in Parkinson's disease (PD). These deficits exacerbate fall risk and difficulties with mobility, especially during complex or dual-task walking. Traditional gait training generally fails to fully address these complex gait activities. Virtual reality (VR) incorporates principles of motor learning while delivering engaging and challenging training in complex environments. We hypothesized that VR may be applied to address the multifaceted deficits associated with fall risk in PD.\nTwenty patients received 18 sessions (3 per week) of progressive intensive treadmill training with virtual obstacles (TT + VR). Outcome measures included gait under usual-walking and dual-task conditions and while negotiating physical obstacles. Cognitive function and functional performance were also assessed.\nPatients were 67.1 \u00b1 6.5 years and had a mean disease duration of 9.8 \u00b1 5.6 years. Posttraining, gait speed significantly improved during usual walking, during dual task, and while negotiating overground obstacles. Dual-task gait variability decreased (ie, improved) and Trail Making Test times (parts A and B) improved. Gains in functional performance measures and retention effects, 1 month later, were also observed.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time that TT + VR has been used for gait training in PD. The results indicate that TT + VR is viable in PD and may significantly improve physical performance, gait during complex challenging conditions, and even certain aspects of cognitive function. These findings have important implications for understanding motor learning in the presence of PD and for treating fall risk in PD, aging, and others who share a heightened risk of falls.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is causally associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Oxygen generates a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS including hydroxyl radicals and H(2)O(2) react with guanine residues in DNA and produce 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). 8-OHdG serves as a biomarker for oxidative stress in various diseases.\nWe investigated urinary 8-OHdG levels in 61 PD patients and 28 normal subjects to evaluate the correlation with various clinical features. We quantified disease severity using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale for motor symptoms (UPDRS part 3), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for mental function, and the Tottori University Hallucination Rating Scale (TUHARS) for quantifying hallucinations.\nThere were significant correlations between 8-OHdG and all the examined parameters, but the partial correlation coefficients excluding contributions of all the other parameters showed that only TUHARS and UPDRS part 3 are significantly related to 8-OHdG. In particular, TUHARS correlates best with urinary 8-OHdG levels.\nThe significant correlation between urinary 8-OHdG levels and hallucinations but not with dementia suggests that hallucinations are likely to have unique but unidentified mechanisms that lead to excessive production of 8-OHdG.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine neurons of the nigrostriatal system, resulting in severe motor disturbances. Although much less appreciated, non-motor symptoms are also very common in PD and many can be traced to serotonin neuronal deficits. Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) 2, the rate-limiting enzyme in the serotonin biosynthesis, is a phenotypic marker for serotonin neurons and is known to be extremely labile to oxidation. Therefore, the oxidative processes that prevail in PD could cause TPH2 misfolding and modify serotonin neuronal function much as is seen in dopamine neurons. Oxidation of TPH2 inhibits enzyme activity and leads to the formation of high molecular weight aggregates in a dithiothreitol-reversible manner. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis shows that as long as a single cysteine residue (out of a total of 13 per monomer) remains in TPH2, it cross-links upon oxidation and only cysteine-less mutants are resistant to this effect. The effects of oxidants on TPH2 catalytic function and cross-linking are also observed in intact TPH2-expressing HEK293 cells. Oxidation shifts TPH2 from the soluble compartment into membrane fractions and large inclusion bodies. Sequential non-reducing/reducing 2-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting confirmed that TPH2 was one of a small number of cytosolic proteins that form disulfide-bonded aggregates. The propensity of TPH2 to misfold upon oxidation of its cysteine residues is responsible for its catalytic lability and may be related to loss of serotonin neuronal function in PD and the emergence of non-motor (psychiatric) symptoms.",

Experimental results show that, between PD and normal rat, there is no obvious change in morphological structure, but significant differences existed in reduced scattering coefficient (mu's) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) of rat striatum; there exists correlation between parameters (mu's, CB3V) obtained by fNIRs and parameters (cerebral blood flow (CBF), CBV) obtained by CT perfusion (CTP).

    "abstract": "Despite significant research efforts, a therapy to slow or halt the progression of Parkinson's disease (\"neuroprotection\") remains elusive. The discovery of such a therapy will likely require important observations from a number of perspectives: basic science investigation, clinical research, and careful observation in medical practice. Any possible insights will require confirmation in rigorous clinical trial testing. Combining the useful insights from all perspectives may be the most promising approach to discovering a neuroprotective therapy.",

    "abstract": "Most medical treatments of Parkinson's disease (PD) are aimed at the reduction of motor symptoms. However, even when motor improvements are evident, patients often report a deterioration of their daily lives. Thus, to achieve a global improvement in personal well-being, not only drugs, but also complementary therapies, such as physical exercise, occupational and speech therapy, and active music therapy, have been used. We hypothesized that theater could reduce clinical disability and improve the quality of life of PD patients (primary end points) more efficiently than other complementary therapies because (1) in order to impersonate a character, patients are forced to regain the control of their bodies; and (2) while being part of a group, patients have a high degree of social interaction. The need to regain the control of their bodies and their social functioning is very likely to deeply motivate patients. To assess this hypothesis, we ran a randomized, controlled, and single-blinded study that lasted 3 years, on 20 subjects affected by a moderate form of idiopathic PD, in stable treatment with L-dopa and L-dopa agonists, and without severe sensory deficits. Ten patients were randomly assigned to an active theater program (in which patients were required to participate), while the others underwent physiotherapy (control group), the most common nonpharmacological treatment for PD rehabilitation. Patients of both groups were evaluated at the beginning of each year, using five clinical rating scales (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS], Schwab and England Scale, Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life [PDQ39] Scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale). The theater patients showed progressive improvements and, at the end of the third year, they showed significant improvements in all clinical scales. Conversely, the control patients did not exhibit significant ameliorations with time. Thus, the present study provides the first scientific evidence that active theater, coupled with conventional medical treatments, represents a valid complementary therapeutic intervention for PD treatment.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to study whether previously described impairment in decision making under risky conditions in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is affected by deficits in using information about potential incentives or by processing feedback (in terms of fictitious gains and losses following each decision). Additionally, we studied whether the neural correlates of using explicit information in decision making under risk differ between PD patients and healthy subjects. We investigated ten cognitively intact PD patients and twelve healthy subjects with the Game of Dice Task (GDT) to assess risky decision making, and with an fMRI paradigm to analyse the neural correlates of information integration in the deliberative decision phase. Behaviourally, PD patients showed selective impairment in the GDT but not on the fMRI task that did not include a feedback component. Healthy subjects exhibited lateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate and parietal activations when integrating decision-relevant information. Despite similar behavioural patterns on the fMRI task, patients exhibited reduced parietal activation. Behavioural results suggest that PD patients' deficits in risky decision making are dominated by impaired feedback utilization not compensable by intact cognitive functions. Our fMRI results suggest similarities but also differences in neural correlates when using explicit information for the decision process, potentially indicating different strategy application even if the interfering feedback component is excluded.",

    "abstract": "Dysphagia is the main cause of aspiration pneumonia and death in Parkinson disease (PD) with no established restorative behavioral treatment to date. Reduced swallow safety may be related to decreased elevation and excursion of the hyolaryngeal complex. Increased submental muscle force generation has been associated with expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) and subsequent increases in hyolaryngeal complex movement provide a strong rationale for its use as a dysphagia treatment. The current study's objective was to test the treatment outcome of a 4-week device-driven EMST program on swallow safety and define the physiologic mechanisms through measures of swallow timing and hyoid displacement.\nThis was a randomized, blinded, sham-controlled EMST trial performed at an academic center. Sixty participants with PD completed EMST, 4 weeks, 5 days per week, for 20 minutes per day, using a calibrated or sham, handheld device. Measures of swallow function including judgments of swallow safety (penetration-aspiration [PA] scale scores), swallow timing, and hyoid movement were made from videofluoroscopic images.\nNo pretreatment group differences existed. The active treatment (EMST) group demonstrated improved swallow safety compared to the sham group as evidenced by improved PA scores. The EMST group demonstrated improvement of hyolaryngeal function during swallowing, findings not evident for the sham group.\nEMST may be a restorative treatment for dysphagia in those with PD. The mechanism may be explained by improved hyolaryngeal complex movement.\nThis intervention study provides Class I evidence that swallow safety as defined by PA score improved post EMST.",

    "abstract": "In recent years Microelectrode recording (MER) analysis has proved to be a powerful localization tool of basal ganglia for Parkinson disease's treatment, especially the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN). In this paper, a signal-dependent method is presented for identification of the STN and other brain zones in Parkinsonian patients. The proposed method, refereed as optimal wavelet feature extraction method (OWFE), is constructed by lifting schemes (LS), which are a flexible and fast implementation of the wavelet transform (WT). The operators in the LS are optimized by means of Genetic Algorithms and Lagrange multipliers considering information contained in MER signals. Then a basic Bayesian classifier (LDC) is used to identify STN and other types of basal ganglia nuclei. The proposed method introduced several advantages from similar works reported in literature. First, the method is signal-dependent and non a priori information is required to decompose the MER signal. Second, the classification accuracy is mostly depended on the feature selection stage because it is not enhanced by elaborated classifiers such as support vector machines or hidden Markov models. Finally, the generalization property of the OWFE has been validated with two databases and different types of classifiers such as k-NN classifier and quadratic Bayesian classifier (QDC). Results have shown that proposed method is able to identify the STN with average accuracy superior than 97%.",

    "abstract": "Gait analysis is important in diagnosing and evaluating certain neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). In this paper, we show the ability of our wireless inertial sensor system to characterize gait abnormalities in PD. We obtain physical features of pitch, roll, and yaw rotations of the foot during walking, use principal component analysis (PCA) to select features, and use the support vector machine (SVM) method to create a classification model. In the binary classification task of detecting the presence of PD by distinguishing between PD and control subjects, the model performs with over 93% sensitivity and specificity, and 97.7% precision. Using a cost-sensitive learner to reflect the different costs associated with misclassifying PD and control subjects, performance of 100% specificity and precision is achieved, while maintaining sensitivity of close to 89%. In the multi-class classification task of characterizing parkinsonian gait by distinguishing among PD with significant gait disturbance, PD with no significant gait disturbance, and control subjects, 91.7% class recall for control subjects is achieved and the model performs with 84.6% precision for PD subjects with significant gait disturbance. The features selected for this classification task indicate the features of gait that are principal in discriminating gait abnormalities due to PD compared to a normal gait. These results demonstrate the ability of our wireless inertial sensor system to successfully detect the presence of PD based on physical features of gait and to identify the specific features that characterize parkinsonian gait.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence techniques have been extensively used for the identification of several disorders related with the voice signal analysis, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, some of these techniques flaw by assuming some separability in the original feature space or even so in the one induced by a kernel mapping. In this paper we propose the PD automatic recognition by means of Optimum-Path Forest (OPF), which is a new recently developed pattern recognition technique that does not assume any shape/separability of the classes/feature space. The experiments showed that OPF outperformed Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks and other commonly used supervised classification techniques for PD identification.",

    "abstract": "Several systems have been proposed to objectively quantify the motor signs of Parkinson's disease. While validity has been investigated for a subset of these systems, test-retest reliability of automated assessments has been more neglected. We have created a protocol that uses a robotic system to measure force and position as the user performs tracking tasks with and without a simultaneous cognitive or motor task. We present preliminary results for test-retest reliability with eight individuals with early to moderate PD. Based on this data, we identified variables with large, significant correlations between the test and retest data. A total of 21 reliable variables were identified with all portions of the assessment protocol producing reliable variables.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the long-term effects of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (DBS-STN) on gait initiation. Six Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who had undergone DBS-STN and 31 control subjects were evaluated. PD subjects were assessed at two different time periods: 11.3 \u00b1 10.3 (P1) and 78.9 \u00b1 10.6 (P2) months after surgery. Subjects under stimulation were tested in two conditions: without medication and with medication. Principal components (PC) analysis was separately applied on vertical, anterior-posterior and medial-lateral ground reaction force (GRF) from gait initiation, during the anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) phase. Three PC scores were chosen by the scree test for each GRF component. The higher loading factors pointed to major differences between controls and PD patients on maximum APA amplitude for vertical and anterior-posterior GRF. Friedman test showed a significant difference in standard distance among conditions (P = 0.006), with the post-hoc test recognizing differences only between P1 and P2 in the medication-on condition. All distances increased in the follow-up evaluation (P2), when considering the same medication condition, indicating a worsening in gait initiation after 7 years of follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease represents a chronic movement disorder, which is generally proportionally to age. The status of Parkinson's disease is traditionally classified through ordinal scale strategies, such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. However, the application of the ordinal scale strategy inherently requires highly specialized and limited medical resources for interpretation. An alternative strategy involves the implementation of an iPhone application that enables the device to serve as a functional wireless accelerometer system. The Parkinson's disease tremor attributes may be recorded in either an effectively autonomous public or private setting, for which the resultant accelerometer signal of the tremor can be conveyed wireless and through email to a remote location for data post-processing. The initial testing and evaluation of the iPhone wireless accelerometer application for quantifying Parkinson's disease tremor successfully demonstrates the capacity to acquire tremor characteristics in an effectively autonomous environment, while potentially alleviating strain on limited and highly specialized medical resources.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the potential of electromyographic (EMG) and acceleration measurements in discriminating patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) from healthy persons. Two types of muscle contractions are examined: static contractions of biceps brachii muscles and elbow extension movements. Twelve features are extracted from static and ten features from extension measurements. These features describe signal morphology and nonlinear characteristics, power spreading in EMG wavelet scalograms and spectral coherence. Principal component approach is applied separately for static and extension trial to reduce the number of features before discrimination. The discrimination between subjects is done in a two-dimensional space by applying cluster analysis to the best discriminating principal components. The discrimination power of the used method was estimated with EMG and acceleration data measured from 56 patients with PD and 59 healthy controls. In the cluster analysis, three clusters were formed: one cluster with most (85%) of the healthy persons and two clusters with 80% of patients. Patients were divided into two clusters based on their type of motor disability (problems during movement and/or static contraction). Discrimination results show that EMG and acceleration measurements are potential for discriminating patients with PD from healthy persons. Furthermore, they have potential in the objective clinical assessment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) injects a high frequency current that effectively disables the diseased basal ganglia (BG) circuit in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, leading to a reversal of motor symptoms. Though therapeutic, high frequency stimulation consumes significant power forcing frequent surgical battery replacements and causing widespread influence into other brain areas which may lead to adverse side effects. In this paper, we conducted a rigorous study to assess whether low frequency signals can restore behavior in PD patients by restoring neural activity in the BG to the normal state. We used a biophysical-based model of BG nuclei and motor thalamus whose parameters can be set to simulate the normal state and the PD state with and without DBS. We administered pulse train DBS waveforms to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) with frequencies ranging from 1-150Hz. For each DBS frequency, we computed statistics on the simulated neural activity to assess whether it is restored to the normal state. In particular, we searched for DBS waveforms that suppress pathological bursting, oscillations, correlations and synchronization prevalent in the PD state and that enable thalamic cells to relay cortical inputs reliably. We found that none of the tested waveforms restores neural activity to the normal state. However, our simulations led us to construct a novel DBS strategy involving low frequency multi-input phaseshifted DBS to be administered into the STN. This strategy successfully suppressed all pathological symptoms in the BG in addition to enabling thalamic cells to relay cortical inputs reliably.",

    "abstract": "In this study a simple model of the postural control system is implemented and its parameters are adjusted to explain the differences between Parkinson's disease patient's measures and healthy young adult's measures by performing simulations of spontaneous sway with center-of-pressure traces. An optimization procedure was performed varying four parameters of the model. The best adjustment obtained was when the proportional and derivative factors where the same as for healthy young adults and noise level gain and force feedback gain varied independently. Differences in the latter parameter can be explained because of insufficient and slowed force production necessary to counteract perturbations in Parkinson's disease patients while the former may be due to noise in the sensory system that estimates the vertical deviation angle and/or perturbations in the execution of the movement.",

    "abstract": "Tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a fundamental feature used in the determination of disease onset and progression. Traditionally, tremor has been evaluated using frequency domain analysis. However, in many cases, this analysis did not show significant differences comparing healthy elders and individuals with PD. Given its complex nature, recently the interest in nonlinear dynamical analysis for better understanding of tremor has grown. In this paper, we examine the effect of PD on the complexity of the tremor time series of PD patients using the approximate entropy method (ApEn). Tremor was also evaluated in the frequency domain. This study involved 11 healthy and 11 PD patients. The peak frequency was similar in both groups, while the amplitude and power in the peak frequency and the total power were significantly higher in PD patients (p < 0.0001). A significant reduction (p < 0.001) in ApEn was observed in PD. ROC analysis showed that ApEn differentiated physiological tremor from tremor in PD patients with high accuracy. These results are in close agreement with pathophysiological fundamentals, and provide evidence that in PD patients the tremor pattern becomes less complex. Furthermore, our findings also suggest that ApEn has a high clinical potential in assessing PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is known to cause mild to profound communication impairments depending on the stage of progression of the disease. There is a growing interest in home-based assessment tools for measuring severity of Parkinson's disease and speech is an appealing source of evidence. This paper reports tasks to elicit a versatile sample of voice production, algorithms to extract useful information from speech and models to predict the severity of the disease. Apart from standard features from time domain (e.g., energy, speaking rate), spectral domain (e.g., pitch, spectral entropy) and cepstral domain (e.g, mel-frequency warped cepstral coefficients), we also estimate harmonic-to-noise ratio, shimmer and jitter using our recently developed algorithms. In a preliminary study, we evaluate the proposed paradigm on data collected through 2 clinics from 82 subjects in 116 assessment sessions. Our results show that the information extracted from speech, elicited through 3 tasks, can predict the severity of the disease to within a mean absolute error of 5.7 with respect to the clinical assessment using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale; the range of target motor sub-scale is 0 to 108. Our analysis shows that elicitation of speech through less constrained task provides useful information not captured in widely employed phonation task. While still preliminary, our results demonstrate that the proposed computational approach has promising real-world applications such as in home-based assessment or in telemonitoring of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Current methods for assessing the efficacy of treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) rely on physician rated scores. These methods pose three major shortcomings: 1) the subjectivity of the assessments, 2) the lack of precision on the rating scale (6 discrete levels), and 3) the inability to assess symptoms except under very specific conditions and/or for very specific tasks. To address these shortcomings, a portable system was developed to continuously monitor Parkinsonian symptoms with quantitative measures based on electrical signals from muscle activity (EMG). Here, we present the system design and the implementation of methods for system validation. This system was designed to provide continuous measures of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia which are related to the neurophysiological source without the need for multiple bulky experimental apparatuses, thus allowing more precise, quantitative indicators of the symptoms which can be measured during practical daily living tasks. This measurement system has the potential to improve the diagnosis of PD as well as the evaluation of PD treatments, which is an important step in the path to improving PD treatments.",

    "abstract": "Entacapone and tolcapone are reversible COMT inhibitors which have been approved for clinical use in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Nebicapone is a third COMT inhibitor which has been studied in humans. COMT inhibitors are used in combination with levodopa and a dopa decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor. Each of them has problems either in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, or in safety. All three inhibitors have short elimination half-lives, about 2-3h. Tolcapone is longer acting and more potent COMT inhibitor than entacapone; nebicapone lies in between. However, none of the present inhibitors cause a complete peripheral COMT inhibition. Tolcapone and nebicapone have increased more levodopa AUC than entacapone which is reflected also in their clinical efficacy. The most common adverse event with COMT inhibitors is dyskinesia which is usually managed by decreasing levodopa dose. The greatest problem with tolcapone and probably also with nebicapone is their liver toxicity which is not seen with entacapone. Tolcapone causes severe diarrhea more often than entacapone. Though the present COMT inhibitors have improved significantly the treatment of advanced PD patients, they still have several problems and weaknesses leaving room for developing better COMT inhibitors.",

L-dopa treatment has remained the most effective therapy for PD, but its further development has been quite a challenge mainly due to the effective metabolism of L-dopa in the human body by multiple pathways, decarboxylation and O-methylation being the two most important of them. The introduction of clinically effective and safe COMT inhibitors has greatly increased the usefulness of L-dopa therapy, but how to utilize the full potential of L-dopa is still unsolved leaving a need for more potent COMT inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) presented difficulties in the performance of multi-joint movements. The purpose of the study was to determine whether the slowness of such movements was caused by the generation of non-linear trajectories and/or by a reduction or a deficit in the modulation of EMG activity. Nine healthy subjects and 10 subjects with PD performed multi-joint movements involving elbow and shoulder with reversal towards three targets in the sagittal plane without any constraint. The movement kinematics were calculated using X and Y coordinates of the markers positioned on the joints. EMG signals were recorded for the muscles related to these movements. The results revealed that subjects with PD presented a lower linear speed and the differences between them and healthy subjects increased with target distance. The trajectory was found to be linear and both groups of subjects had few errors in the targets despite the slower muscle activity in subjects with PD. Another interesting finding was the EMG pattern of subjects with PD. They showed a difficulty in modulating the activity of agonists and antagonists during the different movement phases. The low speed movements of PD subjects were attributable to the low EMG activity and difficulty in modulating the bursts of muscle activity.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has shown that skill focused attention may be beneficial for the performance of complicated motor tasks in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study was to assess the impact of skill focused attention instructions on gait under temporal movement constraints that may reflect common challenges experienced in daily life. Eighteen patients with PD walked a straight pathway under two different attention focus conditions (no instruction, skill focused instruction) and two different walking speeds (preferred pace, as fast as possible). In the no instruction condition, patients were not told \"where\" attention should be directed. In the skill focused instruction condition, patients were told to focus on the foot contacting the floor with each step. Spatial and temporal gait measures, as well as, trunk sway were used to quantify walking performance. The results showed that when walking at a preferred pace, skill focused instructions benefited gait performance (e.g., increased gait velocity, larger steps, more trunk sway). However, when walking as fast as possible, skill focused instructions had the opposite effect on gait performance (e.g., decreased gait velocity, smaller steps, and less trunk sway). This study demonstrates that skill focused instructions may contribute to the prioritization of stability under imposed temporal movement constraints. Clinicians should be aware of the processes involved in prioritization of movement components versus task goals in PD and the potential application of an attention based instructional set in altering priorities in this population.",

    "abstract": "Continuous levodopa delivery by enteral infusion (Duodopa(\u00ae)) is an alternative to deep brain stimulation and subcutaneous apomorphine to control motor fluctuations and dyskinesias in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). We report our experience with Duodopa(\u00ae) therapy in 11 patients with advanced PD.\nWe retrospectively assessed clinical and quality of life changes in all patients with PD with severe motor fluctuations and dyskinesias who started continuous daily levodopa duodenal infusion through percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy from September 2006 (Duodopa(\u00ae) was approved for advanced PD treatment in Spain at that date) until April 2010 at the A. Marcide Hospital of Spain.\nNine patients received Duodopa(\u00ae) [62.7\u00b110.6 (44-74) years, 63.6% male)]. Pre-Duodopa(\u00ae) clinical characteristics of patients were: disease duration 14.5\u00b18.9 (3-34) years, oral levodopa dose 918.2\u00b1277.7 (450-1300) mg/day, and Hoehn and Yahr staging 3.7\u00b10.5 (3-4). Nine patients are still receiving Duodopa(\u00ae). Patients improved motor fluctuations (72.7% significant improvement), dyskinesia (55.5% significant improvement), daily off-time (90.9%) and daily duration dyskinesia (66.6%) after total infusion time of 170.5 months (3-31). The improvement in Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) and Schwab&England Capacity for Daily Living Scale were 38.5\u00b119.8 and 24\u00b112.5 respectively (P<0.05).

    "abstract": "The therapeutic benefit of L-DOPA is commonly attributed to restoration of dopamine (DA) extracellular levels in the striatum of Parkinsonian patients. However, the loss of efficacy of L-DOPA after chronic use is paradoxically associated with a similar or enhanced striatal DA response. Release of L-DOPA-derived DA depends on the widespread serotonergic (5-HT) innervation in the brain. Chronic exposure of 5-HT neurons to L-DOPA could lead to aberrant neurochemical responses beyond the striatum. Using multi-site intracerebral microdialysis in a rat model of Parkinson's disease, we showed that chronic L-DOPA treatment at a therapeutic dose (12 mg/kg/day for 10 days) homogeneously reduced basal 5-HT release and metabolism. These effects were paralleled by a decrease in tissue content of 5-HT and its metabolite. Chronic L-DOPA treatment severely altered the brain pattern of 5-HT and DA release responses to L-DOPA (3-12 mg/kg) with an overall loss of efficacy of L-DOPA to increase DA release. Our data demonstrate for the first time in vivo that the impairment of 5-HT neuronal function induced by chronic L-DOPA alters in a region-dependent manner L-DOPA-induced DA release. Changes in neurochemical pattern of L-DOPA in the brain may favour the occurrence of both motor and non-motor side effects.",

    "abstract": "The cognitive profile of early onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) has not been clearly defined. Mutations in the parkin gene are the most common genetic risk factor for EOPD and may offer information about the neuropsychological pattern of performance in both symptomatic and asymptomatic mutation carriers. EOPD probands and their first-degree relatives who did not have Parkinson's disease (PD) were genotyped for mutations in the parkin gene and administered a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Performance was compared between EOPD probands with (N = 43) and without (N = 52) parkin mutations. The same neuropsychological battery was administered to 217 first-degree relatives to assess neuropsychological function in individuals who carry parkin mutations but do not have PD. No significant differences in neuropsychological test performance were found between parkin carrier and noncarrier probands. Performance also did not differ between EOPD noncarriers and carrier subgroups (i.e., heterozygotes, compound heterozygotes/homozygotes). Similarly, no differences were found among unaffected family members across genotypes. Mean neuropsychological test performance was within normal range in all probands and relatives. Carriers of parkin mutations, whether or not they have PD, do not perform differently on neuropsychological measures as compared to noncarriers. The cognitive functioning of parkin carriers over time warrants further study.",

    "abstract": "Current evidence suggests a role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of basal ganglia injury. Reportedly, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) mitigate DAergic neurotoxicity in rodent models of PD. Consistent with these findings, epidemiological analysis indicated that certain NSAIDs may prevent or delay the progression of PD. However, a serious impediment of chronic NSAID therapy, particularly in the elderly, is gastric, renal and cardiac toxicity. Nitric oxide (NO)-donating NSAIDs, have a safer profile while maintaining anti-inflammatory activity of parent compounds. We have investigated the oral activity of the NO-donating derivative of flurbiprofen, [2-fluoro-\u03b1-methyl (1,1'-biphenyl)-4-acetic-4-(nitrooxy)butyl ester], HCT1026 (30 mg kg(-1) daily in rodent chow) in mice exposed to the parkinsonian neurotoxin MPTP.\nAgeing mice were fed with a control, flurbiprofen, or HCT1026 diet starting ten days before MPTP administration and continuing for all the experimental period. Striatal high affinity synaptosomal dopamine up-take, motor coordination assessed with the rotarod, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)- and dopamine transporter (DAT) fiber staining, stereological cell counts, immunoblotting and gene expression analyses were used to assess MPTP-induced nigrostriatal DAergic toxicity and glial activation 1-40 days post-MPTP.\nHCT1026 was well tolerated and did not cause any measurable toxic effect, whereas flurbiprofen fed mice showed severe gastrointestinal side-effects. HCT1026 efficiently counteracted motor impairment and reversed MPTP-induced decreased synaptosomal [3H]dopamine uptake, TH- and DAT-stained fibers in striatum and TH+ neuron loss in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), as opposed to age-matched mice fed with a control diet. These effects were associated to a significant decrease in reactive macrophage antigen-1 (Mac-1)-positive microglial cells within the striatum and ventral midbrain, decreased expression of iNOS, Mac-1 and NADPH oxidase (PHOX), and downregulation of 3-Nitrotyrosine, a peroxynitrite finger print, in SNpc DAergic neurons.\nOral treatment with HCT1026 has a safe profile and a significant efficacy in counteracting MPTP-induced dopaminergic (DAergic) neurotoxicity, motor impairment and microglia activation in ageing mice. HCT1026 provides a novel promising approach towards the development of effective pharmacological neuroprotective strategies against PD.",

    "abstract": "5-HT(1A) receptors have long been implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders. Recently, several lines of studies have revealed new insights into the therapeutic role of 5-HT(1A) receptors in treating schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Specifically, 5-HT(1A) receptors seem to be a promising target for alleviating antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) and cognitive/affective disorders in schizophrenia. In the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease, 5-HT(1A) agonists are expected to improve not only affective symptoms (e.g., anxiety and depression), but also the core parkinsonian symptoms as well as antiparkinsonian agents-induced side effects (e.g., L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia). Here, the therapeutic mechanisms mediated by 5-HT(1A) receptors in schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease are reviewed. This evidence should encourage discovery of new 5-HT(1A) ligands, which can resolve the unmet clinical needs in the current therapy.",

    "abstract": "We previously observed marked down-regulation of the mRNA for angiogenin, a potent inducer of neovascularization, in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD) based on over-expression of alpha-synuclein. Angiogenin has also been recently implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this study, we confirmed that mouse angiogenin-1 protein is dramatically reduced in this transgenic alpha-synuclein mouse model of PD, and examined the effect of angiogenin in cellular models of PD. We found that endogenous angiogenin is present in two dopamine-producing neuroblastoma cell lines, SH-SY5Y and M17, and that exogenous angiogenin is taken up by these cells and leads to phosphorylation of Akt. Applied angiogenin protects against the cell death induced by the neurotoxins 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium and rotenone and reduces the activation of caspase 3. Together our data supports the importance of angiogenin in protecting against dopaminergic neuronal cell death and suggests its potential as a therapy for PD.",

It is anticipated that the number of affected individuals may increase significantly in the most populous nations by 2030. During the past 20 years, much progress has been made in identifying and assessing various potential clinical, biochemical, imaging and genetic biomarkers for PD. Despite the wealth of information, development of a validated biomarker for PD is still ongoing. It is hoped that reliable and well-validated biomarkers will provide critical clues to assist in the diagnosis and management of Parkinson's disease patients in the near future.",

Relationships of all variables to participation were examined using Pearson correlations. Subsequent regression analysis was employed to determine the mobility measures which best predicted the participation.\nParticipants with PD retained, on average, 78.3% (SD\u200a=\u200a15.6%) of total activities. Participation was negatively correlated with all PDQ-39 domains (r range -0.36 to -0.78, all p\u200a<\u200a0.005) with the mobility domain having the strongest correlation. All mobility measures were significantly correlated with participation, with the final regression model including only FTSTS and FOGQ which combined explained 37% of the variance in participation.\nParticipation is highly related to mobility-related QOL and may be most impacted by ability to stand up from a chair and freezing of gait in those with PD.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this work was to evaluate the possibility to use combined therapy including application of transcranial pulsed electrostimulation and an alternating electrostatic field to the treatment of \"restless legs\" syndrome (RLS) in patients with Parkinson disease. A total of 31 patients with this syndrome were available for observation. A single course of combined therapy resulted in a substantial (60.4%) alleviation of painful sensation in 20 patients. Depression and anxiety decreased by 53.56% and 52.38% respectively. Accordingly, the quality of life increased (6.48%). In the 11 patients of the control group, these changes were much less pronounced; that is, painful sensation, depression, and anxiety decreased by 8.15%, 5.17%, and 10.11% respectively. It is concluded that combined therapy including application of transcranial pulsed electrostimulation and an alternating electrostatic field produced highly beneficial effect in patients with Parkinson disease and restless legs syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The mainstay of Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy is levodopa. The crucial question is when should levodopa be initiated? Levodopa provides the most potent motor benefit for PD, but longer term use is marked by the development of motor complications such as fluctuations in response and involuntary motor movements. Dopamine agonists reduce the risk of development of motor complications in the 5-year term. However, side effects may change the risk-benefit of dopamine agonist first strategies. In the following, the evidence for levodopa and dopamine agonists as initial monotherapy for PD is examined.",

    "abstract": "Motor fluctuations and dyskinesias occur in the majority of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and are likely to result from changes in dopamine production, storage and release, occurring as consequences of the nigrostriatal degenerative process. All studies comparing levodopa versus dopamine agonist early therapy indicate that initiation with agonists is associated with a reduced risk of motor complications -in particular, dyskinesias- possibly because agonists' longer half-lives provide continuous dopaminergic delivery. In advanced PD patients, switching from a pulsatile to continuous dopaminergic delivery may widen patients' therapeutic window. Currently, this can be accomplished only with subcutaneous apomorphine or duodenal levodopa infusions. Apomorphine is a highly soluble agonist whose effect is similar to dopamine. Conversely, replacing whole oral therapy with levodopa infusion bypasses gastric emptying and avoids peaks and troughs in plasma by releasing levodopa in the duodenum/jejunum.",

    "abstract": "The long-term efficacy and safety of deep brain stimulation (DBS) implant for Parkinson's disease (PD) is described in several recent papers. This procedure has been reported to permit a stable reduction of dopaminergic therapy requirements for up to 5 years, although some expectation of deterioration in non-dopaminergic signs has been recently stated. Our aim is to perform a literature-based review of papers available describing long-term post-operative follow-up after a bilateral implant for subthalamic DBS (STN-DBS). Only peer-reviewed published papers with a post-operative follow-up of at least 5 years were considered. Clinical outcome, disease progression and side effects were assessed at baseline and 2 (or 3 years) and 5 years after surgery. Seven papers were included in the review. A total of 238 patients were analyzed. STN-DBS was confirmed to be an effective treatment for selected patients with PD. In all studies, off-related motor symptoms improved dramatically, compared with pre-implant, at 2 (or 3, according to the study) years and this result persisted at 5-year evaluations. Antiparkinsonian drug reductions, improvements in motor fluctuations and dyskinesias, functional measures and the progression of underlying PD were also reported in all series. Some axial scores, in particular postural stability and speech, improved transiently. Persisting adverse effects included eyelid opening apraxia, weight gain, psychiatric disorders, depression, dysarthria, dyskinesias, and apathy. The present review of the 5-year observations confirms that STN-DBS is a powerful method in the management of PD, but its long-term effects must be thoroughly assessed.",

    "abstract": "The long-duration response (LDR) to levodopa is an important component of the therapeutic response to the drug in Parkinson's disease (PD). Some characteristics are peculiar: it is independent from peripheral pharmacokinetics of levodopa, but it is dependent on the intervals between doses and on the size of each dose. Once the LDR fully develops, it is stable and maximal. After stopping treatment, the decay rate is inversely related to the severity of PD; when the LDR decreases over time, the patients present a fluctuating motor response. Therapeutic strategies based on the development and maintenance of the LDR should be sought to maximize the clinical benefit induced by levodopa and to avoid the appearance of motor complications.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing awareness that addictive disorders may occur in Parkinson's disease (PD), either typical substance-related addictions that are commonly known as dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) or behavioral addictive syndromes, usually presenting as impulse control disorders (ICDs) that include pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive eating and buying. DDS is characterized by the use of dopaminergic drugs in doses larger than those required to treat motor symptoms, despite the development of disabling dyskinesias. Case reporting and prospective studies have reported an association between ICDs and the use of dopamine-agonists (DAs) at greater doses, while DDS has been associated with levodopa at greater doses or short-acting DAs. Risk factors for addictions in PD include male sex, younger age or younger age at PD onset, history of substance use or bipolar disorder, and a personality profile characterized by impulsiveness. Functional neuroimaging studies such as functional MRI and PET have investigated in vivo the neurobiological basis of these pathologic behaviors. The management for clinically significant ICD symptoms should consist of modifications to dopamine replacement therapy (DRT), particularly DAs, which is usually associated with an improvement of ICDs, whereas there is no empiric evidence supporting the use of psychiatric drugs in ICDs in PD. Management of DDS is not easy, mainly because balancing the drugs in the long term could represent a difficult problem. Hypomanic and psychotic episodes are best managed with a reduction of DRT performed in hospital also by using atypical antipsychotics low dose.",

    "abstract": "This narrative review examines the effects of drug therapy on the natural history of Parkinson's disease. In terms of modifying the underlying disease process, it is possible that immediate therapy, rather than deferred treatment, can have a positive effect on the underlying disease process. However, it is unlikely that drug therapy has changed mortality from the condition and there is no evidence that it can delay the onset of non-motor features such as dementia and falls. The beneficial effects of drug therapy on the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are unquestionable, but these are at the expense of short-term dopaminergic side effects, long-term motor complications, and impulse control disorders. Major questions remain regarding which initial therapeutic approach should be taken which may possibly be answered by the ongoing PD MED trial. The beneficial effects of drug therapy on the motor features of Parkinson's disease have had a fundamental impact on the suffering of patients. The mainstay of these therapies continues to be levodopa, although it is now used at lower doses than in the past and in combination with other drug classes.",

    "abstract": "Determining the eligibility of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) for deep brain stimulation (DBS) can be challenging for general (non-specialised) neurologists. We evaluated the use of an online screening tool (Stimulus) that aims to support appropriate referral to a specialised centre for the further evaluation of DBS. Implementation of the tool took place via an ongoing European multicentre educational programme, currently completed in 15 DBS centres with 208 referring neurologists. Use of the tool in daily practice was monitored via an online data capture programme. Selection decisions of patients referred with the assistance of the Stimulus tool were compared to those of patients outside the screening programme. Three years after the start of the programme, 3,128 patient profiles had been entered. The intention for referral was made for 802 patients and referral intentions were largely in accordance with the tool recommendations. Follow-up at 6 months showed that actual referral took place in only 28%, predominantly due to patients' reluctance to undergo brain surgery. In patients screened with the tool and referred to a DBS centre, the acceptance rate was 77%, significantly higher than that of the unscreened population (48%). The tool showed a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 12% with a positive and negative predictive value of 79 and 75%, respectively. The Stimulus tool is useful in assisting general neurologists to identify appropriate candidates for DBS consideration. The principal reason for not referring potentially eligible patients is their reluctance to undergo brain surgery.",

    "abstract": "A nontraditional form of exercise recently applied for patients with Parkinson disease (PD) is boxing training. The primary purpose of this case series is to describe the effects of disease severity and duration of boxing training (short term and long term) on changes in balance, mobility, and quality of life for patients with mild or moderate to severe PD. The feasibility and safety of the boxing training program also were assessed.\nSix patients with idiopathic PD attended 24 to 36 boxing training sessions for 12 weeks, with the option of continuing the training for an additional 24 weeks (a seventh patient attended sessions for only 4 weeks). The 90-minute sessions included boxing drills and traditional stretching, strengthening, and endurance exercises. Outcomes were tested at the baseline and after 12, 24, and 36 weeks of boxing sessions (12-, 24-, and 36-week tests). The outcome measures were the Functional Reach Test, Berg Balance Scale, Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, Timed \"Up & Go\" Test, Six-Minute Walk Test, gait speed, cadence, stride length, step width, activities of daily living and motor examination subscales of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, and Parkinson Disease Quality of Life Scale.\nSix patients completed all phases of the case series, showed improvements on at least 5 of the 12 outcome measures over the baseline at the 12-week test, and showed continued improvements at the 24- and 36-week tests. Patients with mild PD typically showed improvements earlier than those with moderate to severe PD.\nDespite the progressive nature of PD, the patients in this case series showed short-term and long-term improvements in balance, gait, activities of daily living, and quality of life after the boxing training program. A longer duration of training was necessary for patients with moderate to severe PD to show maximal training outcomes. The boxing training program was feasible and safe for these patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Following the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, treatment may be initiated with MAO-B-inhibitor, even prior to the development of any functional deficit. For patients with a functional deficit who are younger (usually under 75 years of age) and otherwise in good condition, treatment should be started with a dopamine agonist or MAO-B-inhibitor. In other patients, initial treatment with levodopa is recommended. In the case of difficult on-off-symptoms and dyskinesias in spite of optimal treatment, surgical procedures and duodenal levodopa infusion should be considered. Rehabilitation should be targeted at specific problems associated with functional skills.",

It was shown that application of classical passive vibrostimulation employed under clinical conditions can be recommended to patients presenting with the rigid-trembling form of Parkinson's disease owing to the fact that their system of regulation of the vertical posture readily responds to vibration loading. This effect is attributable to low muscular activity.",

    "abstract": "The intracellular oligomerization of \u03b1-synuclein is associated with Parkinson's disease and appears to be an important target for disease-modifying treatment. Yet, to date, there is no specific inhibitor for this aggregation process. Using unbiased systematic peptide array analysis, we identified molecular interaction domains within the \u03b2-synuclein polypeptide that specifically binds \u03b1-synuclein. Adding such peptide fragments to \u03b1-synuclein significantly reduced both amyloid fibrils and soluble oligomer formation in vitro. A retro-inverso analogue of the best peptide inhibitor was designed to develop the identified molecular recognition module into a drug candidate. While this peptide shows indistinguishable activity as compared to the native peptide, it is stable in mouse serum and penetrates \u03b1-synuclein over-expressing cells. The interaction interface between the D-amino acid peptide and \u03b1-synuclein was mapped by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Finally, administering the retro-inverso peptide to a Drosophila model expressing mutant A53T \u03b1-synuclein in the nervous system, resulted in a significant recovery of the behavioral abnormalities of the treated flies and in a significant reduction in \u03b1-synuclein accumulation in the brains of the flies. The engineered retro-inverso peptide can serve as a lead for developing a novel class of therapeutic agents to treat Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of the axon guidance pathway have been reported to be a possible susceptibility factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). This study investigated whether the genetic variability in the axon guidance pathway is a susceptibility factor in PD patients in the Korean population. A total of 373 patients and 384 healthy subjects were included. A set of 22 SNPs was analyzed, and the risk of PD was evaluated using odds ratios in an unconditional and conditional logistic regression models of age- and gender-matched subsets. A multidimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis was performed to explore potential gene-gene interactions. SNPs in the DCC, CHP, RRAS2 and EPHB1 genes of the axon guidance pathway showed significant associations with PD. The DCC rs17468382 and EPHB1 rs2030737 SNPs may be associated with increased PD risk, and the CHP rs6492998 and RRAS2 rs2970332 SNPs may be associated with reduced PD risk. However, no significant interactions for PD risk were found in the MDR analysis and logistic regression analysis using SNP interaction terms. This study supports that only four of the selected 22 SNPs are regulating factors associated with PD in the Korean population. However, no interactions were found among the SNPs, suggesting that the effect for the pathway as a whole is not greater than that for single genes in the Korean population. Further investigations involving populations of various ethnicities and other genetic markers and models are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) experience a range of deficits of body systems and activities. A clinical test is needed that is reliable, valid, applicable to physical therapist practice, and appropriate for use in early and mid-stages of the disease. PROFILE PD is one such scale, consisting of 24 items that would typically be assessed during the physical therapist's examination and evaluation of individuals with PD. The purpose of this article is to report on clinimetric properties of the PROFILE PD and to make the test available for use.\nInterrater reliability was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Construct validity was determined by comparing scores on the PROFILE PD with the gold standard (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS]) as well as scales of physical activity and participation. Construct validity and structure of the PROFILE PD were further examined using exploratory factor analysis using principal component analysis with Promax rotation that allows a correlated factor structure.\nInterrater reliability of the PROFILE PD was high (ICC = 0.97). Construct validity was demonstrated with the UPDRS (r = 0.86, P < 0.0001), Schwab & England Activities of Daily Living Scale (S&E) (r = -0.83, P < 0.0001), and Continuous Scale Physical Functional Performance test (r = -0.62, P < 0.0001). Principal component analysis demonstrated that the test comprises a single scale.\nThe PROFILE PD is a reliable and valid scale that can be used to quantify alterations in body systems and activity of individuals in early and mid-stages of PD. Use of the scale can provide an overall summary of the impact of PD on body systems and activities.",

    "abstract": "We performed a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify common Parkinson's disease (PD) risk variants in the European population. The initial genome-wide scan was conducted in a French sample of 1039 cases and 1984 controls, using almost 500 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Two SNPs at SNCA were found to be associated with PD at the genome-wide significance level (P < 3 \u00d7 10(-8)). An additional set of promising and new association signals was identified and submitted for immediate replication in two independent case-control studies of subjects of European descent. We first carried out an in silico replication study using GWAS data from the WTCCC2 PD study sample (1705 cases, 5200 WTCCC controls). Nominally replicated SNPs were further genotyped in a third sample of 1527 cases and 1864 controls from France and Australia. We found converging evidence of association with PD on 12q24 (rs4964469, combined P = 2.4 \u00d7 10(-7)) and confirmed the association on 4p15/BST1 (rs4698412, combined P = 1.8 \u00d7 10(-6)), previously reported in Japanese data. The 12q24 locus includes RFX4, an isoform of which, named RFX4_v3, encodes brain-specific transcription factors that regulate many genes involved in brain morphogenesis and intracellular calcium homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The standard reference clinical score quantifying average Parkinson's disease (PD) symptom severity is the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). At present, UPDRS is determined by the subjective clinical evaluation of the patient's ability to adequately cope with a range of tasks. In this study, we extend recent findings that UPDRS can be objectively assessed to clinically useful accuracy using simple, self-administered speech tests, without requiring the patient's physical presence in the clinic. We apply a wide range of known speech signal processing algorithms to a large database (approx. 6000 recordings from 42 PD patients, recruited to a six-month, multi-centre trial) and propose a number of novel, nonlinear signal processing algorithms which reveal pathological characteristics in PD more accurately than existing approaches. Robust feature selection algorithms select the optimal subset of these algorithms, which is fed into non-parametric regression and classification algorithms, mapping the signal processing algorithm outputs to UPDRS. We demonstrate rapid, accurate replication of the UPDRS assessment with clinically useful accuracy (about 2 UPDRS points difference from the clinicians' estimates, p<0.001). This study supports the viability of frequent, remote, cost-effective, objective, accurate UPDRS telemonitoring based on self-administered speech tests. This technology could facilitate large-scale clinical trials into novel PD treatments.",

A Zydis sublingual preparation has more efficient absorption and less first pass amphetamine metabolites. We conducted an open label oral to Zydis switch study to evaluate tolerability of rapid switch, and relative efficacy, in 48 subjects from 5 sites. Overall patients preferred the Zydis preparation. Per clinician global impressions, fluctuations improved and the \"on\" UPDRS part II scores improved. Total UPDRS and measures of fatigue and sleep were unchanged. Adverse events were mild.

    "abstract": "To assess diagnostic accuracy of two self-administered depression measures compared to an interviewer-administered measure in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD), and to analyze clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with disagreement among the three depression assessment tools.\nWe assessed 214 PD subjects using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15), and the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV depression module (SCID). Diagnostic accuracy of the PHQ-9 and GDS-15 compared to the SCID was evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to analyze factors associated with measure disagreement. We compared item agreement between the PHQ-9 and SCID to test the hypothesis that there would be less agreement between items assessing depression symptoms overlapping with common PD symptoms, compared to items having minimal overlap with PD manifestations.\nCompared to SCID diagnosis of major depression, PHQ-9 sensitivity is 50% and specificity is 93%; GDS-15 sensitivity is 43% and specificity is 96%. The GDS-15 has 85% sensitivity and 79% specificity and the PHQ-9 has 54% sensitivity and 85% specificity compared to SCID diagnosis of minor or major depression. The PHQ-9 and SCID show more agreement on items unrelated to PD manifestations. Pain was the only factor associated with disagreement between the SCID and PHQ-9.\nCompared to the PHQ-9, the GDS-15 had higher sensitivity and similar positive predictive value, suggesting it is a superior screening tool in clinical applications for PD. On future depression screening or diagnostic instruments, consideration should be given to excluding depression items overlapping with PD manifestations.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying pain in Parkinson's disease (PD) are unclear. Although a few studies have reported that PD patients may have low pain threshold and tolerance, none could accurately assess whether there was a correlation between sensory thresholds and demographic/clinical features of PD patients. Thus, tactile threshold, pain threshold, and pain tolerance to electrical stimuli in the hands and feet were assessed in 106 parkinsonian patients (of whom 66 reported chronic pain) and 51 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Linear regression models determined relationships between psychophysical parameters and demographic/clinical features. Female gender, severity of disease, medical disease associated with painful symptoms, and dyskinesia were more frequently observed in PD patients experiencing pain, even though dyskinesia did not reach significance. Pain threshold and pain tolerance were significantly lower in PD patients than in control subjects, whereas the tactile threshold yielded comparable values in both groups. Multivariable linear regression analyses yielded significant inverse correlations of pain threshold and pain tolerance with motor symptom severity and Beck depression inventory. Pain threshold and pain tolerance did not differ between PD patients with and without pain. In the former group, there was no relationship between pain threshold and the intensity/type of pain, and number of painful body parts. These findings suggest that pain threshold and pain tolerance tend to decrease as PD progresses, which can predispose to pain development. Female gender, dyskinesia, medical conditions associated with painful symptoms, and postural abnormalities secondary to rigidity/bradikinesia may contribute to the appearance of spontaneous pain in predisposed subjects.",

    "abstract": "Fallibility is inherent in human cognition and so a system that will monitor performance is indispensable. While behavioral evidence for such a system derives from the finding that subjects slow down after trials that are likely to produce errors, the neural and behavioral characterization that enables such control is incomplete. Here, we report a specific role for dopamine/basal ganglia in response conflict by accessing deficits in performance monitoring in patients with Parkinson's disease. To characterize such a deficit, we used a modification of the oculomotor countermanding task to show that slowing down of responses that generate robust response conflict, and not post-error per se, is deficient in Parkinson's disease patients. Poor performance adjustment could be either due to impaired ability to slow RT subsequent to conflicts or due to impaired response conflict recognition. If the latter hypothesis was true, then PD subjects should show evidence of impaired error detection/correction, which was found to be the case. These results make a strong case for impaired performance monitoring in Parkinson's patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, heterogeneous syndrome diagnosed clinically by the presence of classical neurological symptoms and the absence of 'red flags' that suggest alternative secondary parkinsonian disorders. Neuropathologically, nigrostriatal loss and the presence of proteinaceous inclusions (Lewy bodies) confirm the diagnosis. For PD, molecular profiling promises much but is yet to deliver in terms of breakthroughs for identifying at-risk individuals, detecting disease at early stages, improving diagnostic certainty, prognosticating future outcomes or providing surrogate markers of therapeutic efficacy. Recent, large-scale omics studies, driven by technological advances, have generated terabytes of data but not yet met the goal of developing biomarkers suitable for clinical use in PD. In this article we critically evaluate the recent literature to identify the key roadblocks and realistic opportunities facing researchers interested in utilizing molecular profiling in the clinic to improve the diagnosis and treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "This open-label study (NCT00243945) investigated the efficacy of rotigotine transdermal system in 54 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with unsatisfactory control of early morning motor impairment and sleep disturbances. Rotigotine dose was up titrated for 8\u00a0weeks and maintained for 4\u00a0weeks. Mean rotigotine dose at end of maintenance was 11.83\u00a0mg/24\u00a0h (SD 3.86). Patients had two overnight hospital stays at baseline and end of treatment during which early morning motor performance was assessed, prior to first morning dose of regular oral antiparkinsonian medication. Rotigotine improved mean Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III score by -9.3 points, mean Timed Up and Go test duration by -1.4\u00a0s and mean morning finger tapping by 26.5\u00a0taps/min; 46% of patients were considered responders (\u226530% improvement of UPDRS III). Mean Nocturnal Akinesia, Dystonia and Cramps Sum Score was reduced by 61%; mean number of nocturias decreased by 32%. Rotigotine also improved sleep quality. These results suggest a role for rotigotine in treatment of nocturnal and early morning motor disabilities in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Pisa Syndrome is clinically defined as the sustained lateral bending of the trunk worsened by a prolonged sitting position or by walking. Pisa syndrome, also termed lateral trunk flexion (LTF), has been rarely reported in patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) and, therefore, the pathophysiology has been poorly investigated. In some cases, the hyperactivity of paravertebral muscles contralateral to the leaning side has been interpreted as a sign of dystonia; however, it is well known that paravertebral muscles flex the trunk ipsilaterally. We systematically explored the pattern of muscular activation underlying the lateral flexion of trunk in 10 PD patients (mean disease duration: 9.2 \u00b1 3.0 years) presenting LTF for 3.6 \u00b1 2.1 years. EMG performed during stance and during left and right lateral trunk flexion showed a continuous ipsilateral muscular hyperactivity in three patients, while in the remaining ones there was no ipsilateral activity during standing and a tonic contraction of paravertebral muscles contralateral to the leaning side. In conclusion, this EMG study investigating the synergies of paravertebral muscles during dynamic conditions detected two different patterns with a typical dystonic activation in only a minority of cases. Possible pathophysiologic mechanisms and treatment approaches are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The term vulnerability was first associated with the midbrain dopaminergic neurons 85 years ago, before they were identified as monoaminergic neurons, when Foix and Nicolesco (1925) reported the loss of neuromelanin containing neurons in the midbrain of patients with post-encephalitic Parkinson's disease (PD). A few years later, Hassler (1938) showed that degeneration is more intense in the ventral tier of the substantia nigra compacta than in its dorsal tier and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), outlining the concept of differential vulnerability of midbrain dopaminergic (DA-) neurons. Nowadays, we know that other neuronal groups degenerate in PD, but the massive loss of nigral DA-cells is its pathological hallmark, having a pivotal position in the pathophysiology of the disease as it is responsible for the motor symptoms. Data from humans as well as cellular and animal models indicate that DA-cell degeneration is a complex process, probably precipitated by the convergence of different risk factors, mediated by oxidative stress, and involving pathogenic factors arising within the DA-neuron (intrinsic factors), and from its environment and distant interconnected brain regions (extrinsic factors). In light of current data, intrinsic factors seem to be preferentially involved in the first steps of the degenerative process, and extrinsic factors in its progression. A controversial issue is the relative weight of the impairment of common cell functions, such as energy metabolism and proteostasis, and specific dopaminergic functions, such as pacemaking activity and DA handling, in the pathogenesis of DA-cell degeneration. Here we will review the current knowledge about the relevance of these factors at the beginning and during the progression of PD, and in the differential vulnerability of midbrain DA-cells.",

    "abstract": "This study was inspired by coalescing evidence that magnetic therapy may be a viable treatment option for certain diseases. This premise is based on the ability of moderate strength fields (i.e., 0.1 to 1 Tesla) to alter the biophysical properties of lipid bilayers and in turn modulate cellular signaling pathways. In particular, previous results from our laboratory (Wang et al., BMC Genomics, 10, 356 (2009)) established that moderate strength static magnetic field (SMF) exposure altered cellular endpoints associated with neuronal function and differentiation. Building on this background, the current paper investigated SMF by focusing on the adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) in the PC12 rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line that displays metabolic features of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nSMF reproduced several responses elicited by ZM241385, a selective A(2A)R antagonist, in PC12 cells including altered calcium flux, increased ATP levels, reduced cAMP levels, reduced nitric oxide production, reduced p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation, inhibited proliferation, and reduced iron uptake. SMF also counteracted several PD-relevant endpoints exacerbated by A(2A)R agonist CGS21680 in a manner similar to ZM241385; these include reduction of increased expression of A(2A)R, reversal of altered calcium efflux, dampening of increased adenosine production, reduction of enhanced proliferation and associated p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation, and inhibition of neurite outgrowth.\nWhen measured against multiple endpoints, SMF elicited qualitatively similar responses as ZM241385, a PD drug candidate. Provided that the in vitro results presented in this paper apply in vivo, SMF holds promise as an intriguing non-invasive approach to treat PD and potentially other neurological disorders.",

Best evidence synthesis found indicative evidence in support of the use of the instruction to take big steps in walking training for stride length improvement in people with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease who are without cognitive impairment. There was insufficient evidence in support of effects on gait velocity and stride variability. There was also insufficient evidence in support of effects of other instructions on any of the gait variables.\nThe empirical evidence in support of the benefits from verbal instructions is weak.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a profound motor disability that is traceable to the emergence of synchronous, rhythmic spiking in neurons of the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe). The origins of this pathophysiology are poorly defined for the generation of pacemaking. After the induction of a parkinsonian state in mice, there was a progressive decline in autonomous GPe pacemaking, which normally serves to desynchronize activity. The loss was attributable to the downregulation of an ion channel that is essential in pacemaking, the hyperpolarization and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel. Viral delivery of HCN2 subunits restored pacemaking and reduced burst spiking in GPe neurons. However, the motor disability induced by dopamine (DA) depletion was not reversed, suggesting that the loss of pacemaking was a consequence, rather than a cause, of key network pathophysiology, a conclusion that is consistent with the ability of L-type channel antagonists to attenuate silencing after DA depletion.",

    "abstract": "Class IV alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH4) efficiently reduces aldehydes produced during lipid peroxidation, and may thus serve to protect from toxic effects of aldehydes e.g. on neurons. We hypothesized that ADH4 dysfunction may increase risk for Parkinson's disease (PD) and previously reported association of an ADH4 allele with PD. We found that a promoter polymorphism in this allele induced a 25-30% reduction of transcriptional activity. Based on these findings, we have now investigated whether Adh4 homo- (Adh4-/-) or heterozygous (Adh4+/-) knockout mice display any dopamine system-related changes in behavior, biochemical parameters or olfaction compared to wild-type mice. The spontaneous locomotor activity was found to be similar in the three groups, whereas administration of d-amphetamine or apomorphine induced a significant increase in horizontal activity in the Adh4-/- mice compared to wild-type mice. We measured levels of monoamines and their metabolites in striatum, frontal cortex and substantia nigra and found increased levels of dopamine and DOPAC in substantia nigra of Adh4-/- mice. Investigation of olfactory function revealed a reduced sense of smell in Adh4-/- mice accompanied by alterations in dopamine metabolite levels in the olfactory bulb. Taken together, our results suggest that lack of Adh4 gene activity induces changes in the function of the dopamine system, findings which are compatible with a role of loss-of-function mutations in ADH4 as possible risk factors for PD.",

    "abstract": "Visual deficits in early and high level processing nodes have been documented in Parkinson's disease (PD). Non-motor high level visual integration deficits in PD seem to have a cortical basis independently of a low level retinal contribution. It is however an open question whether sensory and visual attention deficits can be separated in PD. Here, we have explicitly separated visual and attentional disease related patterns of performance, by using bias free staircase procedures measuring psychophysical contrast sensitivity across visual space under covert attention conditions with distinct types of cues (valid, neutral and invalid). This further enabled the analysis of patterns of dorsal-ventral (up-down) and physiological inter-hemispheric asymmetries. We have found that under these carefully controlled covert attention conditions PD subjects show impaired psychophysical performance enhancement by valid attentional cues. Interestingly, PD patients also show paradoxically increased visual homogeneity of spatial performance profiles, suggesting flattening of high level modulation of spatial attention. Finally we have found impaired higher level attentional modulation of contrast sensitivity in the visual periphery, where mechanisms of covert attention are at higher demands. These findings demonstrate a specific loss of attentional mechanisms in PD and a pathological redistribution of spatial mechanisms of covert attention.",

    "abstract": "Sensory control of the natural skilled movement of reaching for a food target to eat (reach-to-eat) is closely coupled to the successive phases of the movement. Control subjects visually fixate the target from hand movement onset to the point that the digits contact the food, at which point they look away. This relationship between sensory attention and limb movement suggests that whereas limb advance is under visual control, grasping, limb withdrawal, and releasing the food to the mouth is guided by somatosensation. The pattern of sensory control is altered in Parkinson's disease (PD). PD subjects may visually fixate the target for longer durations prior to movement initiation, during the grasp, and during the initial portion of hand withdrawal suggesting that vision compensates for a somatosensory impairment. Because both medication and listening to favorite musical pieces have been reported to normalize some movements in subjects with PD, the present study compared the effect of medication and listening to preferred musical pieces on sensory attention shifts from vision to somatosensation during the reach-to-eat movement. Biometric measures of eye movement and the movement of the reaching limb were collected from PD subjects and aged-matched control subjects in four conditions in their own homes: off medication, off medication with music, on medication, and on medication with music. Unmedicated PD subjects were slower to visually disengage the target after grasping it. Their disengage latency was shortened by both music and medication. Medication and music did not improve other aspects of reaching, including reaching duration and the ratings of the movement elements of limb advance, grasping, and limb withdrawal. The results are discussed in relation to the idea that one way in which medication and music may aid movement in PD by normalizing somatosensory control of forelimb movement thus reducing compensatory visual monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), a cytotoxic metabolite of dopamine, is the focus of the 'catecholaldehyde hypothesis' about the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. This study explored whether DOPAL is detectable in human striatum - especially in the putamen (Pu), the main site of dopamine depletion in Parkinson disease - and is related to other neurochemical indices of catecholamine stores and metabolism in Parkinson disease.\nPutamen, caudate (Cd), and frontal cortex (Ctx) catechols were measured in tissue from patients with pathologically proven end-stage Parkinson disease (N=15) and control subjects (N=14) of similar age with similar post-mortem intervals.\nPutamen DOPAL (3% of dopamine in controls) correlated with dopamine and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid both across all subjects and within the Parkinson disease and control groups. Pu dopamine was decreased by 93% and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid 95% in Parkinson disease vs. controls, with smaller decreases of DOPAL (83%) and norepinephrine (73%) in Pu and of dopamine (74%) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (82%) in Cd. In Parkinson disease, Pu DOPAL:dihydroxyphenylacetic acid averaged 3.4 times and DOPAL:dopamine 4.4 times control (P=0.03 each). The main catecholamine in Ctx was norepinephrine, which was decreased by 51% in Parkinson disease patients.\nCorrelated decreases of DOPAL, dopamine, and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in Parkinson disease reflect severe loss of Pu dopamine stores, which seems more extensive than loss of Pu norepinephrine or Cd dopamine stores. Increased Pu DOPAL:dihydroxyphenylacetic acid ratios in Parkinson disease suggest decreased detoxification of DOPAL by aldehyde dehydrogenase. Elevated levels of cytosolic DOPAL might contribute to loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "Punding, a peculiar stereotyped behavior characterized by intense fascination with complex, excessive, non-goal-oriented, repetitive activities, is a quite rare condition complicating Parkinson's disease (PD). It is triggered by dopaminergic therapy and could have a strong impact on patient quality of life. No study has specifically investigated medical management of this condition, and only a few anecdotal reports have provided therapeutic hints. Given the suggested similarities to drug-induced dyskinesias, we have previously suggested a multistep algorithm for management of punding. We conducted a prospective open-label study on ten PD punders aimed at testing its validity. In two cases, reduction of levodopa therapy was efficacious; amantadine was effective in controlling punding in four cases; in the remaining cases, quetiapine was employed, with mild efficacy in two cases.",

    "abstract": "Gait impairments, balance impairments, and falls are prevalent in individuals with Parkinson disease (PD). Although the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) can be considered the reference standard for the determination of fall risk, it has a noted ceiling effect. Development of ceiling-free measures that can assess balance and are good at discriminating \"fallers\" from \"nonfallers\" is needed.\nThe purpose of this study was to compare the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) and the Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) with the BBS among individuals with PD and evaluate the tests' reliability, validity, and discriminatory sensitivity and specificity for fallers versus nonfallers.\nThis was an observational study of community-dwelling individuals with idiopathic PD.\nThe BBS, FGA, and BESTest were administered to 80 individuals with PD. Interrater reliability (n=15) was assessed by 3 raters. Test-retest reliability was based on 2 tests of participants (n=24), 2 weeks apart. Intraclass correlation coefficients (2,1) were used to calculate reliability, and Spearman correlation coefficients were used to assess validity. Cutoff points, sensitivity, and specificity were based on receiver operating characteristic plots.\nTest-retest reliability was .80 for the BBS, .91 for the FGA, and .88 for the BESTest. Interrater reliability was greater than .93 for all 3 tests. The FGA and BESTest were correlated with the BBS (r=.78 and r=.87, respectively). Cutoff scores to identify fallers were 47/56 for the BBS, 15/30 for the FGA, and 69% for the BESTest. The overall accuracy (area under the curve) for the BBS, FGA, and BESTest was .79, .80, and .85, respectively.\nFall reports were retrospective.\nBoth the FGA and the BESTest have reliability and validity for assessing balance in individuals with PD. The BESTest is most sensitive for identifying fallers.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder marked by cell death in the Substantia nigra (SN). Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is the major polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in the phospholipid fraction of the brain and is required for normal cellular function. Glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN) are very potent trophic factors for PD. The aim of the study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of GDNF and NTN by investigating their immunostaining levels after administration of DHA in a model of PD. For this reason we hypothesized that DHA administration of PD might alter GDNF, NTN expression in SN. MPTP neurotoxin that induces dopaminergic neurodegeneration was used to create the experimental Parkinsonism model. Rats were divided into; control, DHA-treated (DHA), MPTP-induced (MPTP), MPTP-induced+DHA-treated (MPTP+DHA) groups. Dopaminergic neuron numbers were clearly decreased in MPTP, but showed an increase in MPTP+DHA group. As a result of this, DHA administration protected dopaminergic neurons as shown by tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry. In the MPTP+DHA group, GDNF, NTN immunoreactions in dopaminergic neurons were higher than that of the MPTP group. In conclusion, the characterization of GDNF and NTN will certainly help elucidate the mechanism of DHA action, and lead to better strategies for the use of DHA to treat neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Rest tremor associated with essential tremor (ET) is a condition that poses challenges in diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated tremor parameters in PD and ET patients with rest tremor. Fifteen patients with PD and 15 patients with ET underwent electrophysiological examination to evaluate characteristics of muscle bursting in rest postures. Rest tremor amplitude of PD patients was significantly higher than that of patients with ET (p = 0.002), whereas burst duration and frequency were significantly higher in ET than in PD group (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, respectively). Patients with PD, however, showed some overlap of these electrophysiological values with values from patients with ET. By contrast, rest tremor pattern showed no overlap between the two diseases, because all patients with ET presented a synchronous pattern whereas PD patients had an alternating pattern (p < 0.001), a finding that differentiated the patients on an individual basis. The electromyographic pattern of rest tremor may help to differentiate PD from ET.",

    "abstract": "REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is a REM sleep-related parasomnia which may be considered a \"dissociated state of wakefulness and sleep\", given that conflicting elements of REM sleep (dreaming) and of wakefulness (sustained muscle tone and movements) coexist during the episodes, leading to motor and behavioural manifestations reminiscent of an enacted dream. RBD has been reported in association with \u03b1-synucleinopathies: around a third of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have full-blown RBD. Recent data indicate that PD patients with RBD are more prone to hallucinations than PD patients without this parasomnia. However it is still not clear why RBD in PD is associated with an increased prevalence of VHs. Data exist which suggest that visual hallucinations in PD may be the result of untimely intrusions of REM visual imagery into wakefulness. RBD, which is characterised by a REM sleep dissociation pattern, might be a condition that particularly favours such intrusions. However, other hypotheses may be advanced. In fact, deficits in attentional, executive, visuoperceptual and visuospatial abilities have been documented in RBD and found to occur far more frequently in PD with RBD than in PD without RBD. Neuropsychological deficits involving visual perception and attentional processes are thought to play an important role in the pathophysiology of VHs. On this basis, RBD in PD could be viewed as a contributory risk factor for VHs.",

We also investigated the neuroprotective effect of methanolic extract of Hibiscus asper leaves (50 and 100 mg/kg) in male Wistar rats subjected to unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesion rat model.\nMethanolic extract of Hibiscus asper leaves showed potent antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity. Chronic administration of methanolic extract (50 and 100 mg/kg, i.p., daily, for 7 days) significantly reduce anxiety-like behavior and inhibit depression in elevated plus-maze and forced swimming tests, suggesting anxiolytic and antidepressant activity. Also, spatial memory performance in Y-maze and radial arm-maze tasks was improved, suggesting positive effects on memory formation.\nTaken together, our results suggest that the methanolic extract of Hibiscus asper leaves have antioxidant effects and might provide an opportunity to management neurological abnormalities in Parkinson's disease conditions.",

    "abstract": "Interpretation of clinical trials comparing different drug regimens for Parkinson's disease (PD) is complicated by the different dose intensities used: higher doses of levodopa and, possibly, other drugs produce better symptomatic control but more late complications. To address this problem, conversion factors have been calculated for antiparkinsonian drugs that yield a total daily levodopa equivalent dose (LED). LED estimates vary, so we undertook a systematic review of studies reporting LEDs to provide standardized formulae. Electronic database and hand searching of references identified 56 primary reports of LED estimates. Data were extracted and the mean and modal LEDs calculated. This yielded a standardized LED for each drug, providing a useful tool to express dose intensity of different antiparkinsonian drug regimens on a single scale. Using these conversion formulae to report LEDs would improve the consistency of reporting and assist the interpretation of clinical trials comparing different PD medications.",

    "abstract": "The need for an early and differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is undoubtedly one of the main quests of the century. An early biomarker would enable therapy to begin sooner and would, hopefully, slow or better prevent progression of the disease. We performed transcript profiling via quantitative RT-PCR in RNA originating from peripheral blood samples. The groups were de novo (n\u00a0=\u00a011) and medicated PD (n\u00a0=\u00a094) subjects and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a034), while for negative control Alzheimer's disease (AD; n\u00a0=\u00a014) subjects were recruited as an additional neurodegenerative disease. The results were retested on a second recruitment consisting 22 medicated PD subjects versus 33 controls and 12 AD. Twelve transcripts were chosen as candidate genes, according to previous postmortem brain profiling. Multiple analyses resulted in four significant genes: proteasome (prosome, macropain) subunit-alpha type-2 (PSMA2; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002, OR\u00a0=\u00a01.15 95% CI 1.07-1.24), laminin, beta-2 (laminin S) (LAMB2; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0078, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.26 95% CI 1.24-4.14), aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family-member A1 (ALDH1A1; p\u00a0=\u00a00.016, OR\u00a0=\u00a01.05 95% CI 1.01-1.1), and histone cluster-1 H3e (HIST1H3E; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03, OR\u00a0=\u00a00.975 95% CI 0.953-0.998) differentiating between medicated PD subjects versus controls. Using these four biomarkers for PD diagnosis, we achieved sensitivity and specificity of more than 80%. These biomarkers might be specific for PD diagnosis, since in AD subjects no significant results were observed. In the second validation, three genes (PSMA2, LAMB2 and ALDH1A1) demonstrated high reproducibility. This result supports previous studies of gene expression profiling and may facilitate the development of biomarkers for early diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective treatment for advanced Parkinson disease (PD). Following STN-DBS, speech intelligibility can deteriorate, limiting its beneficial effect. Here we prospectively examined the short- and long-term speech response to STN-DBS in a consecutive series of patients to identify clinical and surgical factors associated with speech change.\nThirty-two consecutive patients were assessed before surgery, then 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year after STN-DBS in 4 conditions on- and off-medication with on- and off-stimulation using established and validated speech and movement scales. Fifteen of these patients were followed up for 3 years. A control group of 12 patients with PD were followed up for 1 year.\nWithin the surgical group, speech intelligibility significantly deteriorated by an average of 14.2%\u00b120.15% off-medication and 16.9%\u00b121.8% on-medication 1 year after STN-DBS. The medical group deteriorated by 3.6%\u00b15.5% and 4.5%\u00b18.8%, respectively. Seven patients showed speech amelioration after surgery. Loudness increased significantly in all tasks with stimulation. A less severe preoperative on-medication motor score was associated with a more favorable speech response to STN-DBS after 1 year. Medially located electrodes on the left STN were associated with a significantly higher risk of speech deterioration than electrodes within the nucleus. There was a strong relationship between high voltage in the left electrode and poor speech outcome at 1 year.\nThe effect of STN-DBS on speech is variable and multifactorial, with most patients exhibiting decline of speech intelligibility. Both medical and surgical issues contribute to deterioration of speech in STN-DBS patients.\nThis study provides Class III evidence that STN-DBS for PD results in deterioration in speech intelligibility in all combinations of medication and stimulation states at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year compared to baseline and to control subjects treated with best medical therapy.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that cognitive loading aggravates the gait impairments that are typically seen in Parkinson's disease (PD). To better understand the relationship between cognition and gait in PD, we evaluated 30 subjects with PD who suffer from motor response fluctuations. The subjects were clinically and cognitively assessed using standard clinical (e.g., Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) and cognitive tests while in the \"ON\" period of the medication cycle. In addition, the subjects wore force-sensitive insoles to quantify the timing of the gait cycles during 80-m walks at a self-selected, comfortable pace during three randomly presented gait conditions: (1) usual-walking, (2) dual tasking (DT), performing serial 3 subtractions (DT_S3), and (3) DT_S7. Stride length, gait speed, gait variability and bilateral coordination of gait were affected by DT, compared to the usual-walking (P < 0.001) as was gait asymmetry (P = 0.024). Stepwise regression analyses showed that a subset of the cognitive performance scores accounted for the changes seen in the gait parameters during DT, e.g., set shifting capabilities as expressed by the Trial Making Test Scores (P < 0.001). Affect (e.g., anxiety) was not associated with DT-related gait changes. For most gait features, DT had a large impact on the DT_S3 condition with only minimal additional effect in the DT_S7 condition. These results demonstrate that the complex cognitive-motor interplay in the control of gait in patients with PD who suffer from motor response fluctuations has a profound and marked effect during DT conditions on gait variability, asymmetry and bilateral coordination, even in the \"ON\" state when patients are likely to be most active, mobile and vulnerable to the negative effects of dual tasking.",

    "abstract": "The MAPT gene has been shown to be associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including forms of parkinsonism and Parkinson disease (PD), but the results reveal population differences. We investigated the association of 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the region of MAPT on chromosome 17q21 with PD and age at onset, by using 443 discordant sib pairs in PD from a public dataset (Mayo-Perlegen LEAPS Collaboration). Association with PD was assessed by the FBAT using generalized estimating equations (FBAT-GEE), while the association with age at onset as a quantitative trait was evaluated using the FBAT-logrank statistic. Five SNPs were significantly associated with PD (P &lt; 0.05) in an additive model, and 9 SNPs were associated with PD (P &lt; 0.05) in dominant and recessive models. Interestingly, 8 PD-associated SNPs were also associated with age at onset of PD (P &lt; 0.05) in dominant and recessive models. The SNP most significantly associated with PD and age at onset was rs17649641 (P = 0.015 and 0.021, respectively). Two-SNP haplotypes inferred from rs17563965 and rs17649641 also showed association with PD (P = 0.018) and age at onset (P = 0.026). These results provide further support for the role of MAPT in development of PD.",

Participants were asked to use the tool twice daily over four days, once when their medication was working at its best (\"on\" state) and once when it had worn off (\"off\" state). Results showed the ability of the data collected to distinguish the \"on\" and \"off\" state and also demonstrated statistically significant differences in timed assessments. It is anticipated that this tool could be used in the home environment as an early alert to a change in clinical condition or to monitor the effects of changes in prescribed medications used to manage PD.",

    "abstract": "The prospect of reward may provide a motivational incentive for optimizing goal-directed behavior. Animal work demonstrates that reward-processing networks and oculomotor-control networks in the brain are connected through the dorsal striatum, and that reward anticipation can improve oculomotor control via this nexus. Due perhaps to deterioration in dopaminergic striatal circuitry, goal-directed oculomotor control is subject to decline in healthy seniors, and even more in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we examine whether healthy seniors and PD patients are able to utilize reward prospects to improve their impaired antisaccade performance. Results confirmed that oculomotor control declined in PD patients compared to healthy seniors, and in healthy seniors compared to young adults. However, the motivational incentive of reward expectation resulted in benefits in antisaccade performance in all groups alike. These findings speak against structural and non-modifiable decline in cognitive control functions, and emphasize the remedial potential of motivational incentive mechanisms in healthy as well as pathological aging.",

They also received lower scores on the 2 complex conditions of the receptive language task. Increased length and syntactic complexity negatively affected performance in both groups of speakers.\nThese findings provide a novel window into the speech deficits associated with PD by examining performance on longer, sentence-level utterances in contrast to earlier investigations of single-word or nonword productions. Speech motor control processes and language comprehension were adversely affected in the majority of our participants with mild to moderate PD compared to the control group. Finally, increased syntactic complexity and sentence length affected both the healthy aging and PD groups' speech production performance at the behavioral and kinematic levels.",

    "abstract": "To establish the diagnostic accuracy of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) when screening externally validated cognition in Parkinson disease (PD), by comparison with a PD-focused test (Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson disease-Cognition [SCOPA-COG]) and the standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (S-MMSE) as benchmarks.\nA convenience sample of 114 patients with idiopathic PD and 47 healthy controls was examined in a movement disorders center. The 21 patients with dementia (PD-D) were diagnosed using Movement Disorders Society criteria, externally validated by detailed independent functional and neuropsychological tests. The 21 patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) scored 1.5 SD or more below normative data in at least 2 measures in 1 of 4 cognitive domains. Other patients had normal cognition (PD-N).\nPrimary outcomes using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses showed that all 3 mental status tests produced excellent discrimination of PD-D from patients without dementia (area under the curve [AUC], 87%-91%) and PD-MCI from PD-N patients (AUC, 78%-90%), but the MoCA was generally better suited across both assessments. The optimal MoCA screening cutoffs were <21/30 for PD-D (sensitivity 81%; specificity 95%; negative predictive value [NPV] 92%) and <26/30 for PD-MCI (sensitivity 90%; specificity 75%; NPV 95%). Further support that the MoCA is at least equivalent to the SCOPA-COG, and superior to the S-MMSE, came from the simultaneous classification of the 3 PD patient groups (volumes under a 3-dimensional ROC surface, chance = 17%: MoCA 79%, confidence interval [CI] 70%-89%; SCOPA-COG 74%, CI 62%-86%; MMSE-Sevens item 56%, CI 44%-68%; MMSE-World item 62%, CI 50%-73%).\nThe MoCA is a suitably accurate, brief test when screening all levels of cognition in PD.",

    "abstract": "A functional repeat polymorphism in the SNCA promoter (REP1) conveys susceptibility for Parkinson disease (PD). There is also increasing evidence that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) elsewhere in the gene are associated with PD risk.\nTo further explore the association of common SNCA SNPs with PD susceptibility, to determine whether evidence of allelic heterogeneity exists, and to examine the correlation between PD-associated variants and plasma \u03b1-synuclein levels.\nTwo-tiered analysis.\nAcademic research.\nPatients and control subjects from the NeuroGenetics Research Consortium.\nWe performed a 2-tiered analysis of 1956 patients with PD and 2112 controls from the NeuroGenetics Research Consortium using a comprehensive tag SNP approach. Previously published REP1 genotypes were also included. Plasma \u03b1-synuclein was assayed in 86 patients with PD and 78 controls using a highly sensitive Luminex assay.\nFive of 15 SNPs genotyped were associated with PD under an additive model in tier 1 (\u03b1 = .05). Of these, 4 were successfully replicated in tier 2. In the combined sample, the most significant marker was rs356219 (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-1.55; P = 1.6 \u00d7 10(-12)), located approximately 9 kilobases downstream from the gene. A regression model containing rs356219 alone best fit the data. The linkage disequilibrium correlation coefficient between this SNP and REP1 was low (r(2) = 0.09). The risk-associated C allele of rs356219 was also correlated with higher transformed plasma \u03b1-synuclein levels in patients under an adjusted additive model (P = .005).\nOur data suggest that 1 or more unidentified functional SNCA variants modify risk for PD and that the effect is larger than and independent of REP1. This variant(s), tagged by rs356219, might act by upregulating SNCA expression in a dose-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Behavioural abnormalities such as impulse control disorders may develop when patients with Parkinson's disease receive dopaminergic therapy, although they can be controlled by deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. We have recorded local field potentials in the subthalamic nucleus of 28 patients with surgically implanted subthalamic electrodes. According to the predominant clinical features of each patient, their Parkinson's disease was associated with impulse control disorders (n = 10), dyskinesias (n = 9) or no dopaminergic mediated motor or behavioural complications (n = 9). Recordings were obtained during the OFF and ON dopaminergic states and the power spectrum of the subthalamic activity as well as the subthalamocortical coherence were analysed using Fourier transform-based techniques. The position of each electrode contact was determined in the postoperative magnetic resonance image to define the topography of the oscillatory activity recorded in each patient. In the OFF state, the three groups of patients had similar oscillatory activity. By contrast, in the ON state, the patients with impulse control disorders displayed theta-alpha (4-10 Hz) activity (mean peak: 6.71 Hz) that was generated 2-8 mm below the intercommissural line. Similarly, the patients with dyskinesia showed theta-alpha activity that peaked at a higher frequency (mean: 8.38 Hz) and was generated 0-2 mm below the intercommissural line. No such activity was detected in patients that displayed no dopaminergic side effects. Cortico-subthalamic coherence was more frequent in the impulsive patients in the 4-7.5 Hz range in scalp electrodes placed on the frontal regions anterior to the primary motor cortex, while in patients with dyskinesia it was in the 7.5-10 Hz range in the leads overlying the primary motor and supplementary motor area. Thus, dopaminergic side effects in Parkinson's disease are associated with oscillatory activity in the theta-alpha band, but at different frequencies and with different topography for the motor (dyskinesias) and behavioural (abnormal impulsivity) manifestations. These findings suggest that the activity recorded in parkinsonian patients with impulse control disorders stems from the associative-limbic area (ventral subthalamic area), which is coherent with premotor frontal cortical activity. Conversely, in patients with l-dopa-induced dyskinesias such activity is recorded in the motor area (dorsal subthalamic area) and it is coherent with cortical motor activity. Consequently, the subthalamic nucleus appears to be implicated in the motor and behavioural complications associated with dopaminergic drugs in Parkinson's disease, specifically engaging different anatomo-functional territories.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD) cell loss in the substantia nigra is known to result in motor symptoms; however widespread pathological changes occur and may be associated with non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairment. Diffusion tensor imaging is a quantitative imaging method sensitive to the micro-structure of white matter tracts.\nTo measure fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values in the corpus callosum and cingulum pathways, defined by diffusion tensor tractography, in patients with PD, PD with dementia (PDD) and controls and to determine if these measures correlate with Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores in parkinsonian patients.\nPatients with PD (17 Males [M], 12 Females [F]), mild PDD (5 M, 1 F) and controls (8 M, 7 F) underwent cognitive testing and MRI scans. The corpus callosum was divided into four regions and the cingulum into two regions bilaterally to define tracts using the program DTIstudio (Johns Hopkins University) using the fiber assignment by continuous tracking algorithm. Volumetric MRI scans were used to measure white and gray matter volumes.\nGroups did not differ in age or education. There were no overall FA or MD differences between groups in either the corpus callosum or cingulum pathways. In PD subjects the MMSE score correlated with MD within the corpus callosum. These findings were independent of age, sex and total white matter volume.\nThe data suggest that the corpus callosum or its cortical connections are associated with cognitive impairment in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "In the investigation of disease aetiology, the genome-wide association study (GWAS) provides a hypothesis-free investigation of the broader human genome and, as with all scientific investigations, replication is essential to validate any findings. To date, six GWAS have been performed to investigate the influence of common genetic variation in Parkinson's disease (PD) and only two associations have been replicated: alpha synuclein (SNCA) and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), both PD candidate genes before GWAS. In our population-based study, we genotyped four of the top single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a previous study. By using the identical analytic method and genetic model in our independent sample, we provide evidence for replication of rs1724425 near MAPT (OR = 0.74, P= 0.0163) and rs1564282 in cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK; OR = 1.61, P= 0.0151); rs3775478 of multimerin 1 (MMRN1) (P= 0.30) and rs356229 of SNCA (P= 0.14) did not replicate in our study population. While MAPT has been considered a PD candidate gene and has been observed in association with PD in other GWAS, GAK is a new candidate for investigation in future studies.",

    "abstract": "The mutations in the LRRK2 gene cause clinically typical, late-onset Parkinson disease, strengthening the idea that the familial forms of the disease represent an important tool for the study of the idiopathic forms. Despite the great effort to describe and functionally characterize the LRRK2 gene product, its physiological role remains elusive. In this article, we will discuss along with other references, our recent findings that assigned a critical role of LRRK2 protein on cytosleketal dynamics and how this direction could provide a valuable platform to further appreciate the mechanism underlying LRRK2-mediated pathophysiology of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common age-associated neurodegenerative disorder. Motor symptoms are the cardinal component of PD, but non-motor symptoms, such as dementia, depression, and autonomic dysfunction are being increasingly recognized. Motor symptoms are primarily caused by selective degeneration of substantia nigra dopamine (SNDA) neurons in the midbrain; non-motor symptoms may be referable to well-described pathology at multiple levels of the neuraxis. Development of symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies is dependent on an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of PD. Gene expression profiling has been recently employed to assess function on a broad level in the hopes of gaining greater knowledge concerning how individual mechanisms of disease fit together as a whole and to generate novel hypotheses concerning PD pathogenesis, diagnosis, and progression. So far, the majority of studies have been performed on postmortem brain samples from PD patients, but more recently, studies have targeted enriched populations of dopamine neurons and have begun to explore extra-nigral neurons and even peripheral tissues. This review will provide a brief synopsis of gene expression profiling in parkinsonism and its pitfalls to date and propose several potential future directions and uses for the technique. It will focus on the use of microarray experiments to stimulate hypotheses concerning mechanisms of neurodegeneration in PD, since the majority of studies thus far have addressed that complicated issue.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence points to reactive glia as a pivotal factor in Parkinson's disease (PD) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned mouse model of basal ganglia injury, but whether astrocytes and microglia activation may exacerbate dopaminergic (DAergic) neuron demise and/or contribute to DAergic repair is presently the subject of much debate. Here, we have correlated the loss and recovery of the nigrostriatal DAergic functionality upon acute MPTP exposure with extensive gene expression analysis at the level of the ventral midbrain (VM) and striata (Str) and found a major upregulation of pro-inflammatory chemokines and wingless-type MMTV integration site1 (Wnt1), a key transcript involved in midbrain DAergic neurodevelopment. Wnt signaling components (including Frizzled-1 [Fzd-1] and \u03b2-catenin) were dynamically regulated during MPTP-induced DAergic degeneration and reactive glial activation. Activated astrocytes of the ventral midbrain were identified as candidate source of Wnt1 by in situ hybridization and real-time PCR in vitro. Blocking Wnt/Fzd signaling with Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) counteracted astrocyte-induced neuroprotection against MPP(+) toxicity in primary mesencephalic astrocyte-neuron cultures, in vitro. Moreover, astroglial-derived factors, including Wnt1, promoted neurogenesis and DAergic neurogenesis from adult midbrain stem/neuroprogenitor cells, in vitro. Conversely, lack of Wnt1 transcription in response to MPTP in middle-aged mice and failure of DAergic neurons to recover were reversed by pharmacological activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, in vivo, thus suggesting MPTP-reactive astrocytes in situ and Wnt1 as candidate components of neuroprotective/neurorescue pathways in MPTP-induced nigrostriatal DAergic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) models suggest that early events along the path to neurodegeneration involve activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), and the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways, in both the sporadic and familial forms of the disease, and thus ER stress may be a common feature. Furthermore, impairments in protein degradation have been linked to oxidative stress as well as pathways associated with ER stress. We hypothesize that oxidative stress is a primary initiator in a multi-factorial cascade driving dopaminergic (DA) neurons towards death in the early stages of the disease. We now report results from proteomic analysis of a rotenone-induced oxidative stress model of PD in the human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y. Cells were exposed to sub-micromolar concentrations of rotenone for 48h prior to whole cell protein extraction and shotgun proteomic analysis. Evidence for activation of the UPR comes from our observation of up-regulated binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), heat shock proteins, and foldases. We also observed up-regulation of proteins that contribute to the degradation of misfolded or unfolded proteins controlled by the UPS and ERAD pathways. Activation of the UPR may allow neurons to maintain protein homeostasis in the cytosol and ER despite an increase in reactive oxygen species due to oxidative stress, and activation of the UPS and ERAD may further augment clean-up and quality control in the cell.",

    "abstract": "Although some epidemiologic studies found inverse associations between alcohol drinking and Parkinson's disease (PD), the majority of studies found no such significant associations. Additionally, there is only limited research into the possible interactions of alcohol intake with aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 2 activity with respect to PD risk. We examined the relationship between alcohol intake and PD among Japanese subjects using data from a case-control study.\nFrom 214 cases within 6 years of PD onset and 327 controls without neurodegenerative disease, we collected information on \"peak\", as opposed to average, alcohol drinking frequency and peak drinking amounts during a subject's lifetime. Alcohol flushing status was evaluated via questions, as a means of detecting inactive ALHD2. The multivariate model included adjustments for sex, age, region of residence, smoking, years of education, body mass index, alcohol flushing status, presence of selected medication histories, and several dietary factors.\nAlcohol intake during peak drinking periods, regardless of frequency or amount, was not associated with PD. However, when we assessed daily ethanol intake separately for each type of alcohol, only Japanese sake (rice wine) was significantly associated with PD (adjusted odds ratio of \u226566.0 g ethanol per day: 3.39, 95% confidence interval: 1.10-11.0, P for trend = 0.001). There was no significant interaction of alcohol intake with flushing status in relation to PD risk.\nWe did not find significant associations between alcohol intake and PD, except for the daily amount of Japanese sake. Effect modifications by alcohol flushing status were not observed.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to develop a quantitative measure of bradykinesia which can be conveniently used during clinical finger taps test in patients with Parkinson's disease. A miniature, light-weight gyrosensor free from gravitational artifact was used for measurement of finger taps in order to impose minimal constraint on patients. Forty Parkinson's disease patients and 14 age-matched control subjects participated in the experiments. Subjects' finger taps in both right and left hands were scored by two independent neurologists according to the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale and were also measured by a gyrosensor. Four performance indices were derived from the gyrosensor signal of the index finger. All indices showed significant differences between control and patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and also significant correlations with the clinical finger taps score (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.73\u00a0to\u00a0-0.80, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). ANOVA showed significant differences in all indices among different finger taps scores (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and post hoc tests showed significant differences in indices between most pairs of non-neighboring and part of neighboring pairs of finger taps scores (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The results suggest that indices from a gyrosensor can be used as quantitative measures of bradykinesia during the finger taps test.",

    "abstract": "The protein p62 plays an important role in the proteasomal and/or autophagic clearance of misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins. Immunoreactivity for p62, however, not only characterizes pathological proteinaceous inclusions but also occurs in the form of homogeneous nerve cell labeling in brains of both healthy and diseased individuals, e.g., in the vagal dorsal motor nucleus and other subcortical nuclei. In sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), the pathological process initially involves preganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic and sympathetic system and probably advances caudo-rostrally from there along the neuroaxis. Since all subsequently affected nuclei (lower raphe nuclei, magnocellular reticular formation, locus coeruleus, and central subnucleus of the amygdala) generate descending projections that terminate in the vagal dorsal motor nucleus and intermediolateral column, it has been conjectured that retrograde axonal transport and transsynaptic transmission of a pathogen contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. The hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus also sends projections to the preganglionic nuclei under consideration and, thus, should belong to the nuclei endangered by the pathological process. However, it remains uninvolved for the duration of the disorder. For this reason, we performed a retrospective study of the relevant nuclei in a cohort of 36 individuals, including 17 with clinically documented PD, one case with incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD), and 18 controls using p62-immunocytochemistry. Remarkably, the neurosecretory cells of the paraventricular nucleus were among the sites showing homogeneous p62-immunolabeling with the greatest consistency. Its p62-immunoreactive profile may indicate that the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus is somehow capable of effectively metabolizing misfolded proteins and/or preventing their aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Gait variability has potential utility as a predictive measure of dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD). Current understanding implicates non-dopaminergic pathways. This study investigated the explanatory characteristics of gait variability in PD on and off medication under single and dual task conditions. Fifty people with PD were assessed twice at home (on and off L: -dopa) whilst walking under single and dual task conditions, and variability (coefficient of variation, CV) was calculated for stride time and double limb support (DLS) time. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to identify predictors. The first block of variables included age, gait speed, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), and the second block included motor severity (UPDRS III), executive function (Hayling and Brixton) and attention (Test of Everyday Attention). Motor severity predicted stride time variability and DLS time variability independent of L: -dopa during single task gait. Dual task gait yielded a more complex picture. Depression made a unique contribution of 9.0% on medication and 5.0% off medication to stride time variability, and visual attention and younger age contributed to DLS variability on medication, explaining 3% and 2%, respectively. Motor severity predicted DLS variability off medication, explaining 74% of variance. Different characteristics explain the two measures of gait variability, pointing to different control mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to determine the value of the paired-pulse inhibition (PPI) in the auditory cortex in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and analyze its dependence on clinical characteristics of the patients. The central (Cz) auditory evoked potentials were recorded in 58 patients with PD and 22 age-matched healthy subjects. PPI of the N1/P2 component was significantly (P < .001) reduced for interstimulus intervals 500, 700, and 900\u2009ms in patients with PD compared to control subjects. The value of PPI correlated negatively with the age of the PD patients (P < .05), age of disease onset (P < .05), body bradykinesia score (P < .01), and positively with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) cognitive score (P < .01). Negative correlation between value of PPI and the age of the healthy subjects (P < .05) was also observed. Thus, results show that cortical inhibitory processes are deficient in PD patients and that the brain's ability to carry out the postexcitatory inhibition is age-dependent.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) affects patients' lives with more than just physical impairment. Many of the non-motor aspects of PD, such as cognitive impairment, depression, and sleep disturbances, are common and are associated with a variety of poor outcomes. However, at present, the pathophysiology and clinical management of these symptoms are poorly understood.\nThe authors sought to determine the associations between various illness-associated cytokines, cortisol, and the non-motor symptoms of PD.\nThe authors examined a panel of cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1) and cortisol in a cohort of 52 PD patients with depression.\nThere were a number of significant correlations between the non-motor symptoms and TNF-\u03b1. Specifically, the authors found that TNF-\u03b1 (but not IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, or cortisol) was significantly correlated with measures of cognition, depression, and disability. In regression analyses accounting for all variables, TNF-\u03b1 was consistently significant in explaining variance in cognition, depression, sleep, and disability.\nThese data are consistent with a growing body of literature that implicates inflammatory cytokines in neural and behavioral processes and further suggests that TNF-\u03b1 may be involved in the production and/or maintenance of non-motor symptoms in PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was the analysis of fundamental frequency (F(0)) variability (fundamental frequency standard deviation [F(0)SD]) and net speech rate (NSR) in the course of reading in Parkinsonian patients' speech, with special emphasis on the changes of F(0)SD and NSR from the first to the last sentence of the task.\nWe examined 138 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 50 age-matched control persons using a standardized reading task with subsequent acoustical analysis of F(0)SD and NSR. A subgroup of 20 PD patients underwent a standardized levodopa challenge.\nF(0)SD in PD patients was significantly reduced compared with the control group when based on the measurement of the entire reading task. Furthermore, in the PD group, NSR and F(0)SD showed significant changes from the first to the last sentence of the reading task, but no correlation was seen between NSR and F(0)SD. Standardized levodopa administration had no effect on NSR and F(0)SD when related to the entire reading passage, but the aforementioned decline of F(0) variability in the course of reading seemed to be counterbalanced by levodopa administration.\nIn this large series of PD patients, previous findings of reduced F(0)SD in PD were confirmed. Additionally, this is the first analysis to show an increasing reduction of F(0) variability in the course of reading mirroring abnormalities in the dynamical aspects of speech in PD. According to the results of the levodopa challenge, dopaminergic stimulation seems to ameliorate dynamic intonation changes over time, whereas overall intonation variability might be a PD symptom independent of dopaminergic control.",

Furthermore, in the PD group, NSR and F(0)SD showed significant changes from the first to the last sentence of the reading task, but no correlation was seen between NSR and F(0)SD. Standardized levodopa administration had no effect on NSR and F(0)SD when related to the entire reading passage, but the aforementioned decline of F(0) variability in the course of reading seemed to be counterbalanced by levodopa administration.",

    "abstract": "A high incidence of fractures, particularly of the hip, represents an important problem in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), who are prone to falls and have osteoporosis. We previously showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) deficiency due to sunlight deprivation with compensatory hyperparathyroidism causes reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in elderly patients with PD. The present study was undertaken to address the possibility that sunlight exposure may maintain BMD and reduce the incidence of hip fracture in elderly patients with PD. In a prospective study, PD patients were assigned to regular sunlight exposure (n=162) or usual lifestyle (n=162), and followed for 2 years. BMD of the second metacarpal bone was measured using a computed X-ray densitometer. Incidence of hip fracture in the two patient groups during the 2 year follow-up period was assessed. At baseline, patients of both groups showed vitamin D deficiency due to sunlight deprivation with compensatory hyperparathyroidism. The exposed group patients were exposed to sunlight (3231 min/year). BMD increased by 3.8% in the sunlight-exposed group and decreased by 2.6% in the usual lifestyle group (p<.0001). Serum 25-OHD level increased from 27 nmol/L to 52 nmol/L in the sunlight-exposed group. Eleven patients sustained hip fracture in the normal lifestyle group, and 3 fractures occurred among the sunlight-exposed group (p=.03; odds ratio=2.4). Sunlight exposure can increase the BMD of vitamin D deficient bone by increasing 25-OHD concentration and leads to the prevention of hip fracture.",

    "abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein aggregates in Lewy bodies and plays a central role in the pathogenesis of a group of neurodegenerative disorders, known as \"Synucleinopathies\", including Parkinson's disease. Parkin mutations result in loss of parkin E3-ubiquitin ligase activity and cause autosomal recessive early onset parkinsonism.\nWe tested how these two genes interact by examining the effects of parkin on post-translational modification of \u03b1-Synuclein in gene transfer animal models, using a lentiviral gene delivery system into the striatum of 2-month old male Sprague Dawley rats.Viral expression of wild type \u03b1-Synuclein caused accumulation of \u03b1-Synuclein and was associated with increased cell death and inflammation. \u03b1-Synuclein increased PLK2 levels and GSK-3\u03b2 activity and increased the levels of phosphorylated \u03b1-Synuclein and Tau. Parkin co-expression reduced the levels of phosphorylated \u03b1-Synuclein and attenuated cell death and inflammation. Parkin reduced PLK2 levels and increased PP2A activation.\nThese data suggest that parkin reduces \u03b1-Synuclein levels and alters the balance between phosphatase and kinase activities that affect the levels of phosphorylated \u03b1-Synuclein. These results indicate novel mechanisms for parkin protection against \u03b1-Synuclein-induced toxicity in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by the presence in the brain of intracellular protein inclusions highly enriched in aggregated alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn). Although it has been established that progression of the disease is accompanied by sustained activation of microglia, the underlying molecules and factors involved in these immune-triggered mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Lately, accumulating evidence has shown the presence of extracellular \u03b1-Syn both in its aggregated and monomeric forms in cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma. However, the effect of extracellular \u03b1-Syn on cellular activation and immune mediators, as well as the impact of familial PD-linked \u03b1-Syn mutants on this stimulation, are still largely unknown.\nIn this work, we have compared the activation profiles of non-aggregated, extracellular wild-type and PD-linked mutant \u03b1-Syn variants on primary glial and microglial cell cultures. After stimulation of cells with \u03b1-Syn, we measured the release of Th1- and Th2- type cytokines as well as IP-10/CXCL10, RANTES/CCL5, MCP-1/CCL2 and MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 chemokines. Contrary to what had been observed using cell lines or for the case of aggregated \u03b1-Syn, we found strong differences in the immune response generated by wild-type \u03b1-Syn and the familial PD mutants (A30P, E46K and A53T).\nThese findings might contribute to explain the differences in the onset and progression of this highly debilitating disease, which could be of value in the development of rational approaches towards effective control of immune responses that are associated with PD.",

    "abstract": "The mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system linking the dopaminergic midbrain to the prefrontal cortex and subcortical striatum has been shown to be sensitive to reinforcement in animals and humans. Within this system, coexistent segregated striato-frontal circuits have been linked to different functions. In the present study, we tested patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic cell loss, on two reward-based learning tasks assumed to differentially involve dorsal and ventral striato-frontal circuits. 15 non-depressed and non-demented PD patients on levodopa monotherapy were tested both on and off medication. Levodopa had beneficial effects on the performance on an instrumental learning task with constant stimulus-reward associations, hypothesized to rely on dorsal striato-frontal circuits. In contrast, performance on a reversal learning task with changing reward contingencies, relying on ventral striato-frontal structures, was better in the unmedicated state. These results are in line with the \"overdose hypothesis\" which assumes detrimental effects of dopaminergic medication on functions relying upon less affected regions in PD. This study demonstrates, in a within-subject design, a double dissociation of dopaminergic medication and performance on two reward-based learning tasks differing in regard to whether reward contingencies are constant or dynamic. There was no evidence for a dose effect of levodopa on reward-based behavior with the patients' actual levodopa dose being uncorrelated to their performance on the reward-based learning tasks.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory impairment is a consistent premotor symptom in sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), presumably caused by pathological processes in the olfactory bulb and olfactory structures within mesolimbic brain areas. The objective of the present study was to obtain an in-depth insight into olfactory network dysfunction in PD patients. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (3 T) was conducted with 16 early-stage PD patients and 16 matched controls during an odor detection task. Activation within the olfactory network was analyzed both in terms of strength of activation (whole-brain random effects, regions of interest [ROI] analysis based on the hemodynamic response function) as well as time-course characteristics (finite impulse response-based ROI analysis). Olfactory-induced activation in patients with PD in comparison to a standard activation pattern obtained from controls revealed profound hyperactivation in piriform and orbitofrontal cortices. However, whereas orbitofrontal areas seem to be unable to discriminate between signal and noise, primary olfactory cortex shows preserved discriminatory ability. These results support a complex network dysfunction that exceeds structural pathology observed in the olfactory bulb and mesolimbic cortices and thus demonstrate the important contribution of functional data to describe network dynamics occurring in the degenerating brain.",

    "abstract": "Hypomanic symptoms depending on anatomical location of contacts are reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated by deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). However, the underlying cortical and subcortical dysfunction is debated. In this study, five PD patients implanted with DBS-STN who presented with reversible and reproducible hypomanic symptoms after stimulation of specific 'manic' contacts were investigated. Hypomanic symptoms were assessed using the Bech and Rafaelsen Mania Scale (MAS). Three dimensional anatomical location of 'euthymic' and 'manic' contacts, after matching the postoperative CT scan with the preoperative stereotactic MRI, and a H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) study testing 'euthymic' and 'manic' contacts, were performed. Under 'euthymic' conditions, MAS score (mean\u00b1SD) was 0.6\u00b10.5 compared with 7.8\u00b13.1 under 'manic' conditions. Nine of 10 'manic' contacts were located in the substantia nigra, mainly in its ventral part. PET showed that hypomania was associated with strong asymmetrical cerebral activation involving preferentially the right hemisphere and was mediated by activation of the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex. The present study demonstrates the role of the subcortical structures in the genesis of hypomania in PD patients treated with DBS and stresses the involvement of the substantia nigra.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson disease (PD), even in the presence of symptomatic relief from medical, surgical, and rehabilitative interventions, face a persistent worsening of disability. This disability is characterized by diminished quality of life, reduced functional mobility, declining performance in activities of daily living and worsening neurological impairments. While evidence has emerged supporting the clinically meaningful benefits of short-term exercise programs on these underlying factors, assertions regarding the effects of sustained programs of exercise and physical activity on the trajectory of disablement in PD are made in the absence of direct evidence. Indeed, the natural decline in quality of life and functional mobility in people diagnosed with PD is poorly understood. Moreover, outcome measures commonly used in clinical exercise trials typically do not capture the full spectrum of disability as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO).\nThe objective of this multicenter prospective study will be to examine the 2-year trajectory of disablement in a cohort of persons with PD. Two hundred sixty participants will be recruited to produce an expected final sample size of 150 individuals. Participants will be included if they are greater than 40 years of age, have a neurologist confirmed diagnosis of idiopathic PD, and are at Hoehn and Yahr stages 1 through 4. Data will be collected every 6 months during the study period. Primary outcome measures reflecting a broad spectrum of disablement will include, but will not be limited to, MDS-UPDRS, Timed Up and Go, Berg Balance Test, Nine Hole Peg Test, PDQ-39, and directly monitored ambulatory activity. Self-reported exercise and physical activity data also will be recorded. Statistical analyses will be used to characterize the trajectory of disablement and examine the influence of its underlying contributing factors.\nTertiary prevention is an important component of contemporary healthcare for individuals living with degenerative disease. For individuals with PD, there is growing recognition that exercise and/or physical activity efforts to slow the rate of functional mobility decline, in particular, may be critical for optimizing quality of life. By describing the natural trajectory of disablement, exercise habits, and physical activity in a cohort of persons with PD, this investigation will establish an important foundation for future intervention research. Specifically, through the evaluation of the influence of sustained exercise and physical activity on disablement, the study will serve as a preliminary step toward developing a randomized controlled trial of long-term exercise in persons with PD.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the effect of eight weekly yoga sessions on balance, mobility and reported quality of life of an individual with Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, to test the methodology in order to inform future research.\nA 69-year-old female with an 8-year history of PD (Hoehn and Yahr rating two) was selected for the study, which had a single subject ABA design. A 1-week baseline was followed by an 8-week period of weekly 60\u2009min yoga classes and a further 5 weeks of treatment withdrawal. Main outcome measures used were Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up and Go (TUG) and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39); collected at baseline, before, during and after the intervention and at follow-up.\nAn improvement was noted in the BBS and TUG during the intervention phase; although these changes did not appear to be clinically significant. No change in quality of life as measured by the PDQ-39 was noted.\nThe objective improvements in functional activities during the intervention period were not clinically significant. Subjectively, the participant gained much enjoyment and relaxation from the yoga classes. This study justifies the need for further studies using a larger sample size. Additionally, it will inform the methodological design.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra and a striatal dopamine decrease. Striatal extracellular adenosine and ATP modulate the dopaminergic neurotransmission whereas guanosine has a protective role in the brain. Therefore, the regulation of their levels by enzymatic activity may be relevant to the clinical feature of PD. Here it was evaluated the extracellular nucleotide hydrolysis from striatal slices 4 weeks after a unilateral infusion with 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle. This infusion increased ADP, AMP, and GTP hydrolysis by 15, 25, and 41%, respectively, and decreased GDP hydrolysis by 60%. There was no change in NTPDases1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 5'-nucleotidase transcription. Dopamine depletion changes nucleotide hydrolysis and, therefore, alters the regulation of striatal nucleotide levels. These changes observed in 6-OHDA-lesioned animals may contribute to the symptoms observed in the model and provide evidence to indicate that extracellular purine hydrolysis is a key factor in understanding PD, giving hints for new therapies.",

Each patient received 21 treatment sessions of 50 minutes each. Patients were evaluated by a blinded rater before and after treatment as well as 1 month posttreatment using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC), postural transfer test, self-destabilization of the center of foot pressure test, number of falls, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), modified Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) Staging Scale, and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).\nAt the end of treatment, the experimental group showed significant improvements in all outcome measures, except for the UPDRS and the H&Y scale. Improvement was maintained at the 1-month follow-up in all outcome measures except for the GDS.

Replication was attempted in an additional cohort of 1039 French PD cases and 1984 controls for the 27 regions showing the strongest evidence of association (P< 10(-4)). We replicated published associations in the 4q22/SNCA and 17q21/MAPT chromosome regions (P< 10(-10)) and found evidence for an additional independent association in 4q22/SNCA. A detailed analysis of the haplotype structure at 17q21 showed that there are three separate risk groups within this region. We found weak but consistent evidence of association for common variants located in three previously published associated regions (4p15/BST1, 4p16/GAK and 1q32/PARK16). We found no support for the previously reported SNP association in 12q12/LRRK2. We also found an association of the two SNPs in 4q22/SNCA with the age of onset of the disease.",

    "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that levels of CSF biomarkers associated with dementia and cognitive impairment are correlated with cognitive performance in non-demented Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Twenty-two non-demented patients with PD underwent neuropsychological testing and lumbar puncture to collect CSF. We correlated performance scores on the Logical Memory (delayed), Category Fluency, Digit Symbol, and Trails B minus A with CSF concentrations of amyloid (A) \u03b2(42), total tau (t-tau), A\u03b2(42)/t-tau, and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). We observed significant associations between performance on the Digit Symbol test and CSF levels of A\u03b2(42), A\u03b2(42)/t-tau, and BDNF, and between performance on the Category Fluency (vegetable) and A\u03b2(42)/t-tau. While several of these associations were attenuated by adjusting for age, our results suggest that it may be possible to use CSF biomarkers to characterize pathophysiologic processes underlying even mild cognitive deficits in non-demented PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is typically an extremely successful method of restoring pain-free function and providing good long-term outcomes for patients with end-stage knee disease. However, outcomes are less predictable in persons with Parkinson disease. The limited literature available and our experience lead us to conclude that complication rates in the perioperative and postoperative periods with TKA are comparatively high in persons with Parkinson disease. In addition, a good functional outcome is less certain than in the general population. For persons with Parkinson disease who require TKA, we propose an integrative, collaborative approach to avoid complications and optimize outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This letter introduces MercuryLive, a platform to enable home monitoring of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) using wearable sensors. MercuryLive contains three tiers: a resource-aware data collection engine that relies upon wearable sensors, web services for live streaming and storage of sensor data, and a web-based graphical user interface client with video conferencing capability. Besides, the platform has the capability of analyzing sensor (i.e., accelerometer) data to reliably estimate clinical scores capturing the severity of tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia. Testing results showed an average data latency of less than 400 ms and video latency of about 200 ms with video frame rate of about 13 frames/s when 800 kb/s of bandwidth were available and we used a 40% video compression, and data feature upload requiring 1 min of extra time following a 10 min interactive session. These results indicate that the proposed platform is suitable to monitor patients with PD to facilitate the titration of medications in the late stages of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Information about the impact of age on the electrophysiological characteristics of accessory pathways (APs) in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome remains limited.\nA total of 1,885 consecutive patients (mean age 43 \u00b1 17 years, male 61.5%) with WPW syndrome who were referred to the tertiary center for an electrophysiological study and radiofrequency catheter ablation were investigated. The patients were divided into 4 groups based on their age (Group 1: <20; Group 2: 20-39; Group 3: 40-59; Group 4: \u226760 years old). With age, more left-sided APs (53.2%, 67.7%, 71.7%, 75.7%, P < 0.001) and a longer duration of the arrhythmia (4.3 \u00b1 2.8 years, 10.1 \u00b1 7.0 years, 12.4 \u00b1 10.9 years, 14.0 \u00b1 12.4 years, P < 0.001) were noted. The incidence of concealed APs (53.5%, 53.0%, 57.8%, 60.9%, P = 0.01), and orthodromic atrioventricular (AV) reentrant tachycardia (92.4%, 94.2%, 96.5%, 96.3%, P = 0.023) increased with age. The tachycardia cycle length, antegrade (275.5 \u00b1 42.2 ms, 286.7 \u00b1 62.7 ms, 302.5 \u00b1 66.5 ms, 315.2 \u00b1 80.2 ms, P < 0.001) and retrograde AP effective refractory periods (APERPs) (254.0 \u00b1 42.5 ms, 263.3 \u00b1 51.8 ms, 274.5 \u00b1 100.5 ms, 292.7 \u00b1 57.0 ms, P < 0.001), atrial ERP, antegrade AV node effective refractory period (AVNERP), and ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) lengthened as the age increased. The incidence of decremental APs, multiple APs, and a catecholamine response were similar. The duration of the catheter ablation, total fluoroscopy time, acute success rate, complication rate, and incidence of a secondary procedure were similar between the different age groups.\nThe electrophysiological characteristics and pattern of the arrhythmic attack associated with the AP changed with age.",

    "abstract": "Specific motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) can be treated effectively with direct electrical stimulation of deep nuclei in the brain. However, this is an invasive procedure, and the fraction of eligible patients is rather low according to currently used criteria. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS), a minimally invasive method, has more recently been proposed as a therapeutic approach to alleviate PD akinesia, in light of its proven ability to rescue locomotion in rodent models of PD. The mechanisms accounting for this effect are unknown but, from accumulated experience with the use of SCS in the management of chronic pain, it is known that the pathways most probably activated by SCS are the superficial fibers of the dorsal columns. We suggest that the prokinetic effect of SCS results from direct activation of ascending pathways reaching thalamic nuclei and the cerebral cortex. The afferent stimulation may, in addition, activate brainstem nuclei, contributing to the initiation of locomotion. On the basis of the striking change in the corticostriatal oscillatory mode of neuronal activity induced by SCS, we propose that, through activation of lemniscal and brainstem pathways, the locomotive increase is achieved by disruption of antikinetic low-frequency (<30 Hz) oscillatory synchronization in the corticobasal ganglia circuits.",

    "abstract": "As Parkinson's disease appears to be a multifactoral disorder, the use of animal models to investigate combined effects of genetic and environmental risk factors are of great importance especially in the context of aging which is the single major risk factor for the disorder. Here, we assessed the combined effects of neonatal iron feeding and environmental paraquat exposure on age-related nigrostriatal degeneration in transgenic mice expressing the A53T familial mutant form of human \u03b1-synuclein within these neurons. We report here that A53T \u03b1-synuclein mice exhibit greater susceptibility to paraquat. Increased oral intake of iron in the neonatal period leads to a progressive age-related enhancement of dopaminergic neurodegeneration associated with paraquat neurotoxicity. Furthermore, neurodegeneration associated with these combined genetic and environmental risk factors could be attenuated by systemic treatment with the bioavailable antioxidant compound EUK-189. These data suggest that environmental factors previously identified as contributors to neurodegeneration associated with sporadic Parkinson's disease may also be candidates for observed variations in symptoms and disease progression in monogenic forms and that this may mechanistically involve increased levels of oxidatively-induced post-translational nitration of \u03b1-synuclein.",

    "abstract": "VGF mRNA and its precursor-derived products are selectively expressed in certain neurons and promptly respond to neurotrophins and to neural/electrical activity. Proteomic studies have previously revealed a reduction in some VGF peptides in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients affected by Alzheimer's disease and other conditions, suggesting their potential diagnostic and clinical significance. As the presence of VGF peptides within the human cortex has been somewhat elucidated, they were studied postmortem in the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortex areas of control subjects and patients affected by Parkinson's disease, and in parietal cortex samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease. We raised antibodies to the C-/N-terminal portions of the proVGF precursor protein, to the TPGH and TLQP sequences and to the neuroendocrine regulatory peptide (NERP)-1, all used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay coupled with gel chromatography and for immunohistochemistry. In the control brain samples, the levels of TPGH and C-terminus peptides were about 130-200 and 700-2000 pmol g\u207b\u00b9, respectively, the N-terminus and NERP-1 peptides were less represented (about 10-30 and 4-20 pmol\u2003g\u207b\u00b9, respectively), and the TLQP peptides were below detection limits. Upon gel chromatography, the VGF antisera mainly revealed small molecular weight forms (i.e. about 0.8-1.3 kDa), whereas VGF immunolocalisation was found within different types of neuron in rat and bovine brain cortices. In the Parkinson's disease samples, a clear-cut decrease was revealed in the parietal cortex only, exclusively for TPGH and NERP-1 peptides, whereas in the Alzheimer's disease samples, a reduction in all of the VGF peptides was shown. The results suggest the involvement of VGF in the physiological or pathophysiological mechanisms occurring in the parietal cortex of patients with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of neurofilament triplet protein (NFL), a non-specific marker of neuronal damage, are normal in Parkinson's disease (PD) but increased after brain trauma and in several neurological disorders. Using longitudinal CSF-NFL measurements as an indicator of neuronal damage, this study investigated the impact of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on the brain, directly following the surgical intervention and in chronically treated patients with PD.\nCSF-NFL levels were measured consecutively in eight patients with PD before and after STN-DBS treatment.\nCSF-NFL levels were normal prior to STN-DBS and increased sharply during the first 2 weeks post-operatively, but normalized after 12 months or more.\nThe STN-DBS procedure leads to an acute but limited neuronal damage, as expected. However, normal CSF-NFL levels at 12 months post-operatively and beyond suggest the absence of any long-term neuronal damage caused by long-term STN-DBS stimulation.",

The authors investigated this measure of the structural architecture of thought in the dream and waking mentation of 20 nonpsychotic patients with Parkinson's disease after treatment with prodopaminergic drugs. Statistically overlapping levels of cognitive bizarreness were found in the waking fantasy and dream reports of the Parkinson's disease population, whereas almost no bizarreness was found in the waking cognition of the comparison group, suggesting it may be an inherent quality of cognition in Parkinson's disease patients, possibly related to the cholinergic/dopaminergic imbalance underlying this complex disorder.",

    "abstract": "Previous research highlights the presence of social anxiety disorder related to disfiguring diseases, although DSM-IV precludes the diagnosis of social anxiety disorder related to a medical condition. The present study investigated the frequency and severity of social anxiety disorder in patients with Parkinson's disease (n=50) and comparison subjects (n=50). Social anxiety was diagnosed in 16% of patients with Parkinson's disease and 2% of the comparison subjects. Regression analysis revealed younger age and depression as predictive factors of social anxiety. This study supported the likelihood of social anxiety disorder as a comorbid condition in Parkinson's disease. Revision of the criteria for social anxiety disorder in future diagnostic systems is necessary for the detection and management of these patients.",

    "abstract": "This study examined depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance, and quality of life in 35 patients with Parkinson's disease. Results showed that nocturnal sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and motor disease severity accounted for over two-thirds of the variance in quality of life scores. Depression was the largest predictor of quality of life, uniquely explaining 21% of the variance. Nocturnal sleep disturbance was associated with depressive symptoms as well as with daytime sleepiness. Overall, these data highlight the need to screen patients for even mild levels of depression because its relationship with sleep and quality of life are evident early in the disease course.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated pupil light reflex (PLR) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and normal controls by means of pupillometry and explored its possible relation to clinical characteristics in parkinsonian patients. PLR was evaluated using pupillometry in 66 patients with PD without clinical evidence of autonomic dysfunction and 44 healthy matched controls. PLR was elicited by single flash stimuli of 24.6 candelas/m(2) intensity and 20 ms duration, and six parameters were studied after full recording of pupil's movement. A significant increase in latency (T1) and significant decrease in amplitude (R1-R2), maximum constriction velocity (V(max)), as well as maximum acceleration (AC(max)) was found in parkinsonian patients. There was no significant difference in initial radius (R1) and minimum radius (R2) values. Of the parameters studied, AC(max) emerged as a significant predictor for discrimination between PD patients and controls. There was no significant correlation between pupillometry parameters and clinical characteristic of patients (disease duration, stage, and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating motor scale). The study demonstrates PLR disorder in PD patients even without overt clinical autonomic dysfunction. Pupillometry appears to be a useful and noninvasive method for exploration of PLR alterations in PD and may prove to be useful for the early detection of subclinical autonomic nervous system dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD) include the presence of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) rich Lewy bodies and neurites and the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra (SN). Animal models of PD based on viral vector-mediated over-expression of \u03b1-syn have been developed and show evidence of DA toxicity to varying degrees depending on the type of virus used, its concentration, and the serotype of vector employed. To date these models have been variable, difficult to reproduce, and slow in their evolution to achieve a desired phenotype, hindering their use as a model for testing novel therapeutics. To address these issues we have taken a novel vector in this context, that can be prepared in high titer and which possesses an ability to produce neuronally-directed expression, with expression dynamics optimised to provide a rapid rise in gene product expression. Thus, in the current study, we have used a high titer chimeric AAV1/2 vector, to express human A53T \u03b1-syn, an empty vector control (EV), or green fluorescent protein (GFP), the latter to control for the possibility that high levels of protein in themselves might contribute to damage.\nWe show that following a single 2 \u03bcl injection into the rat SN there is near complete coverage of the structure and expression of A53T \u03b1-syn or GFP appears throughout the striatum. Within 3 weeks of SN delivery of their respective vectors, aggregations of insoluble \u03b1-syn were observed in SN DA neurons. The numbers of DA neurons in the SN were significantly reduced by expression of A53T \u03b1-syn (52%), and to a lesser extent by GFP (24%), compared to EV controls (both P < 0.01). At the level of the striatum, AAV1/2-A53T \u03b1-syn injection produced dystrophic neurites and a significant reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase levels (by 53%, P < 0.01), this was not seen in the AAV1/2-GFP condition.\nIn the current implementation of the model, we recapitulate the primary pathological hallmarks of PD, although a proportion of the SN damage may relate to general protein overload and may not be specific for A53T \u03b1-syn. Future studies will thus be required to optimise the dose of AAV1/2 employed before fully characterizing this model. The dynamics of the evolution of the pathology however, provide advantages over current models with respect to providing an initial screen to assess efficacy of novel treatments that might prevent/reverse \u03b1-syn aggregation.",

Within 3 weeks of SN delivery of their respective vectors, aggregations of insoluble \u03b1-syn were observed in SN DA neurons. The numbers of DA neurons in the SN were significantly reduced by expression of A53T \u03b1-syn (52%), and to a lesser extent by GFP (24%), compared to EV controls (both P < 0.01). At the level of the striatum, AAV1/2-A53T \u03b1-syn injection produced dystrophic neurites and a significant reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase levels (by 53%, P < 0.01), this was not seen in the AAV1/2-GFP condition.",

    "abstract": "chelators can modulate \u03b2-amyloid accumulation, protect against tau hyperphosphorylation, and block metal-related oxidative stress, and thereby hold considerable promise as effective anti-AD drugs. At present, a growing interest is focusing on increasing the efficacy and targeting of chelators through drug design. To this end, we have developed a new class of multifunctional prochelators from three FDA- approved drugs rasagiline, rivastigmine, and donepezil or tacrine. HLA20 A was designed by merging the important pharmacophores of rasagiline, rivastigmine, and donepezil into our newly developed multifunctional chelator HLA20. M30D was constructed using the key pharmacophoric moieties from rasagiline, rivastigmine, and tacrine. Experiments showed that both compounds possess potent anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in vitro with weak inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), and without significant metal-binding activity. M30D was found also to be a highly potent MAO A inhibitor with moderate inhibition of MAO B in vitro. Both HLA20 and M30D can be activated by inhibition of AChE to release active chelators HLA20 and M30, respectively. HLA20 and M30 have been shown to be able to modulate amyloid precursor protein regulation and beta-amyloid reduction, suppress oxidative stress, and passivate excess metal ions (Fe, Cu, and Zn). Compared with the activated chelator HLA20 or M30, both HLA20A and M30D exhibited lower cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, substantiating the prochelator strategy for minimizing toxicity associated with poor targeted chelators.",

    "abstract": "The capacity to act as an electron donor and acceptor makes iron an essential cofactor of many vital processes. Its balance in the body has to be tightly regulated since its excess can be harmful by favouring oxidative damage, while its deficiency can impair fundamental activities like erythropoiesis. In the brain, an accumulation of iron or an increase in its availability has been associated with the development and/or progression of different degenerative processes, including Parkinson's disease, while iron paucity seems to be associated with cognitive deficits, motor dysfunction, and restless legs syndrome. In the search of DNA sequence variations affecting the individual predisposition to develop movement disorders, we scanned by DHPLC the exons and intronic boundary regions of ceruloplasmin, iron regulatory protein 2, hemopexin, hepcidin and hemojuvelin genes in cohorts of subjects affected by Parkinson's disease and idiopathic neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). Both novel and known sequence variations were identified in most of the genes, but none of them seemed to be significantly associated to the movement diseases of interest.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which projects to the striatum. We induced a selective loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, by infusing the mitochondrial complex 1 inhibitor 1-methyl 4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) into adult beagle dogs (N=5). Single voxel \u00b9H water suppressed magnetic resonance spectroscopy (\u00b9H-MRS) at 3 T was used to assess the metabolic changes in the striatum of canine before and after MPTP intoxication. The metabolite spectra obtained from the striatum (voxel size: 2 cm\u00b3) showed a lower N-acetyl aspartate to total creatine (creatine+phosphocreatine) ratio after MPTP intoxication. There were no significant differences in other metabolite ratios such as glutamate+glutamine, choline-containing compounds (glycerophosphocholine+phophorylcholine and myo-inositol). Our findings indicated that \u00b9H-MRS is a sensitive, noninvasive measure of neural toxicity and biochemical alterations of the striatum in a canine model of PD, and further studies are needed to confirm brain metabolic changes in association with progression of MPTP-intoxication.",

    "abstract": "To examine the voice, speech dysfunction and acoustic parameters typically associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), including the effects on respiration, phonation, articulation and prosody; the effect of treatment with the drug levodopa and deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus is also examined.\nOne of the features of PD is the alteration of voice and speech. The motor deficits associated with PD adversely affect the major systems that govern speech motor control including respiration, phonation, and articulation. The speech deficits related to PD are often called hypokinetic dysarthria and can be characterized by monopitch, mono-loudness, reduced stress, imprecise consonants, and inappropriate silences. Numerous studies have documented these changes using a wide variety of acoustic measures.\nAcoustic correlates of PD have a potential to provide useful biomarkers and sensitive methods for the early detection of the onset, progression, and severity of disease states, as well as providing a means to objectively track symptomatic changes and to assess the efficacy of pharmacological and surgical treatments.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease in the general population after Alzheimer's disease. Its diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic motor symptoms due to the striatal dopaminergic depletion caused by progressive neuronal death in the pars compacta substantiae nigrae. Thus, not only is it necessary to restore the neurochemical deficits that are present from the initial phases of the disease onwards, but therapeutic strategies also need to be developed to stop the degenerative process.\nRasagiline is a monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor whose dopaminergic stimulation has proved to be effective in monotherapy or in combined therapy for improving the motor symptoms in patients with PD in the initial and advanced phases. Likewise, it is also effective in diminishing motor fluctuations.\nComparatively, rasagiline has proved to be at least as effective as entacapone in the control of motor fluctuations. With regard to the possible effect and the neuroprotective properties of rasagiline in vitro and in vivo, it is the first pharmaceutical to have displayed a change in the developmental course of PD after 72 weeks' treatment.",

    "abstract": "Overexpression of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-SYN), a protein which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), triggers microglial activation and adaptive immune responses, and leads to neurodegeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. We hypothesized a link between the humoral adaptive immune response and microglial activation in \u03b1-SYN induced neurodegeneration. To test this hypothesis, we employed adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) to selectively over-express human \u03b1-SYN in the substantia nigra (SN) of wild-type mice and Fc\u03b3R-/- mice, which lack high-affinity receptors for IgG. We found that in wild-type mice, \u03b1-SYN induced the expression of NF-\u03baB p65 and pro-inflammatory molecules. In Fc\u03b3R-/- mice, NF-\u03baB activation was blocked and pro-inflammatory signaling was reduced. Microglial activation was examined using immunohistochemistry for gp91PHOX. At four weeks, microglia were strongly activated in wild-type mice, while microglial activation was attenuated in Fc\u03b3R-/- mice. Dopaminergic neurodegeneration was examined using immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and unbiased stereology. \u03b1-SYN overexpression led to the appearance of dysmorphic neurites, and a loss of DA neurons in the SN in wild-type animals, while Fc\u03b3R-/- mice did not exhibit neuritic change and were protected from \u03b1-SYN-induced neurodegeneration 24 weeks after injection. Our results suggest that the humoral adaptive immune response triggered by excess \u03b1-SYN plays a causative role in microglial activation through IgG-Fc\u03b3R interaction. This involves NF-\u03baB signaling, and leads to DA neurodegeneration. Therefore, blocking either Fc\u03b3R signaling or specific intracellular signal transduction events downstream of Fc\u03b3R-IgG interaction, such as NF-\u03baB activation, may be viable therapeutic strategies in PD.",

    "abstract": "Altered dopamine homeostasis is an accepted mechanism in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. \u03b1-Synuclein overexpression and impaired disposal contribute to this mechanism. However, biochemical alterations associated with the interplay of cytosolic dopamine and increased \u03b1-synuclein are still unclear. Catecholaminergic SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells are a suitable model for investigating dopamine toxicity. In the present study, we report the proteomic pattern of SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing \u03b1-synuclein (1.6-fold induction) after dopamine exposure. Dopamine itself is able to upregulate \u03b1-synuclein expression. However, the effect is not observed in cells that already overexpress \u03b1-synuclein as a consequence of transfection. The proteomic analysis highlights significant changes in 23 proteins linked to specific cellular processes, such as cytoskeleton structure and regulation, mitochondrial function, energetic metabolism, protein synthesis, and neuronal plasticity. A bioinformatic network enrichment procedure generates a significant model encompassing all proteins and allows us to enrich functional categories associated with the combination of factors analyzed in the present study (i.e. dopamine together with \u03b1-synuclein). In particular, the model suggests a potential involvement of the nuclear factor kappa B pathway that is experimentally confirmed. Indeed, \u03b1-synuclein significantly reduces nuclear factor kappa B activation, which is completely quenched by dopamine treatment.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of fatigue in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and compare this to the general population. Factors associated with fatigue were investigated by linear regression. Fatigue was assessed by the fatigue questionnaire. The mean age of the 176 PD patients (41% women) was 69 years (range 35-90), and the mean UPDRSIII was 22.3 (SD 11.7). Fatigue levels (means) were significantly higher in PD patients compared with the general population; however, effect sizes were moderate for women for physical and total fatigue indicating clinically significant differences here only. Only female PD patients had more chronic fatigue than the general population. Fatigue was related to characteristics of PD but also to sleep disturbance, depression, and gender. This population-based study demonstrates that fatigue is a common symptom in PD patients, but compared with the general population, clinically significant differences were only found for female PD patients.",

We used single-blind and open-label motor, cognitive and quality of life (QOL) evaluations to study the effects of bilateral STN stimulation in 45 patients over 5 years. Our patients showed a stable and substantial reduction in the cardinal signs of PD, motor fluctuations, and dyskinesias but less so for axial signs. The reduction in medications and the intensity of electrical stimulation needed also remained stable during follow up. Although the total QOL and its parkinsonism and social components showed sustained benefits till 5 years, the gains in emotional and systemic subsets were short lasting. Global scores for mood and cognition did not show significant worsening. Benefits of STN stimulation on the cardinal signs, motor complications, and QOL of advanced PD were substantial and sustained till 5 years. The initial benefits in axial motor signs and emotional and psychological aspects of QOL did not show similar stability. In general, the procedure had insignificant impact on cognition and mood. This is the first report of STN stimulation in Asian patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that patients with REM sleep behavior disorder, many of whom will develop Parkinson's disease (PD) or a related synucleinopathy, will demonstrate decreased heart rate variability (HRV) compared with a group of age-matched controls as measured by an electrocardiogram during wakefulness. We compared HRV in 11 untreated idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder patients (9 men and 2 women; mean age, 63.3 years; SD, 7.5 years) and 11 control subjects with idiopathic insomnia without REM sleep behavior disorder (7 men and 4 women; mean age, 59.5 years; SD, 8.7 years). Subjects with other causes of reduced HRV were excluded. HRV was determined from 5-minute presleep segments of a single channel electrocardiogram recorded during polysomnographic evaluations, using R-R intervals during wakefulness. Time domain, geometric measures, and spectral analysis of the R-R intervals were significantly different between cases and controls. A discriminant function analysis correctly classified 95.5% of subjects (overall model fit, P = 0.016). Leave-one-out cross-validation correctly classified 77.3% of subjects. HRV during wakefulness is significantly decreased in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder compared with control subjects, suggesting abnormalities of both sympathetic and parasympathetic function. Patients with RBD may later develop motor and cognitive features of a Lewy body disorder, such as PD. Cardiac autonomic dysfunction is also impaired in PD, suggesting that impaired HRV may be an early sign of PD. HRV measured by routine electrocardiograms could be used to screen for Lewy body disorders such as PD.",

    "abstract": "Apathy is a frequent feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), usually related with executive dysfunction. However, in a subgroup of PD patients apathy may represent the only or predominant neuropsychiatric feature. To understand the mechanisms underlying apathy in PD, we investigated emotional processing in PD patients with and without apathy and in healthy controls (HC), assessed by a facial emotion recognition task (FERT). We excluded PD patients with cognitive impairment, depression, other affective disturbances and previous surgery for PD. PD patients with apathy scored significantly worse in the FERT, performing worse in fear, anger, and sadness recognition. No differences, however, were found between nonapathetic PD patients and HC. These findings suggest the existence of a disruption of emotional-affective processing in cognitive preserved PD patients with apathy. To identify specific dysfunction of limbic structures in PD, patients with isolated apathy may have therapeutic and prognostic implications.",

    "abstract": "Background. Resistance training research has demonstrated positive effects for persons with Parkinson's disease (PD), but the number of acute training variables that can be manipulated makes it difficult to determine the optimal resistance training program. Objective. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the effects of an 8-week resistance training intervention on strength and function in persons with PD. Methods. Eighteen men and women were randomized to training or standard care for the 8-week intervention. The training group performed 3 sets of 5-8 repetitions of the leg press, leg curl, and calf press twice weekly. Tests included leg press strength relative to body mass, timed up-and-go, six-minute walk, and Activities-specific Balance Confidence questionnaire. Results. There was a significant group-by-time effect for maximum leg press strength relative to body mass, with the training group significantly increasing their maximum relative strength (P < .05). No other significant interactions were noted (P > .05). Conclusions. Moderate volume, high-load weight training is effective for increasing lower-body strength in persons with PD.",

    "abstract": "Quantification of neuromotor symptoms with device-based measures provides a useful supplement to clinical evaluation. Research using the CATSYS has established its utility as a computerized measurement system to quantify neuromotor function. The primary objective of this study is to provide technical guidance on the use of the CATSYS in Parkinson's disease (PD). Forty-four patients with idiopathic PD and 28 healthy controls were prospectively recruited and evaluated with CATSYS, a portable, Windows-based system consisting of a data logger and four different sensors (tremor pen, touch recording plate, reaction time handle, and force plate for balance recording) for quantification of neuromotor functions. CATSYS discriminated between PD and controls on measurements of rest/postural tremor, pronation/supination, finger tapping, simple reaction time, and postural sway intensity and velocity. CATSYS measurements using the proposed test battery were associated with relevant clinician-rated Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) items assessing tremor and bradykinesia. More work is warranted to establish CATSYS as a diagnostic/monitoring instrument in movement disorders using the proposed technical approaches.",

    "abstract": "Although visual cues can improve gait in Parkinson's disease (PD), their underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Previous research suggests that cues contribute optical flow that is essential to elicit gait improvement. The present study manipulated how optic flow was provided, and how this might influence freezing of gait (FOG) in PD. Therefore, three groups; 15 PD FOG, 16 PD non-FOG, and 16 healthy controls were tested in 3 narrow doorway conditions; baseline (Narrow), ground lines (Ground), and laser (Laser). Step length indicated that the PD FOG group was only able to improve with ground lines, while the laser increased gait variability and double support time. These results suggest that optic flow in itself is not enough to elicit gait improvement in PD. When PD patients use visual cues, gait becomes less automatically controlled and hence preplanned conscious control may be an important factor contributing to gait improvement.",

    "abstract": "Although dual-task interference has previously been demonstrated to have a significant effect on postural control among individuals with Parkinson's disease, the impact of speech complexity on postural control has not been demonstrated using quantitative biomechanical measures. The postural stability of twelve participants with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and twelve healthy age-matched controls was evaluated under three conditions: (1) without a secondary task, (2) performing a rote repetition task and (3) generating a monologue. Results suggested a significant effect of cognitive load on biomechanical parameters of postural stability. Although both groups increased their postural excursion, individuals with Parkinson's disease demonstrated significantly reduced excursion as compared with that of healthy age-matched controls. This suggests that participants with Parkinson's disease may be overconstraining their postural adjustments in order to focus attention on the cognitive tasks without losing their balance. Ironically, this overconstraint may place the participant at greater risk for a fall.",

Persons receiving active CES had, on average, a 1.14-point decrease in pain compared with a 0.23-point decrease for those receiving sham CES (Wilcoxon Z = -2.20, P = .028). Conclusion. Use of CES at home by persons with PD is feasible and may be somewhat helpful in decreasing pain. A larger study is needed to determine the characteristics of persons who may experience meaningful pain reduction with CES. Guidelines for future studies are provided.",

    "abstract": "Genes important for mitochondrial function have been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). Mitochondrial translation initiation factor 3 (MTIF3) is a nuclear encoded protein required for the initiation of complex formation on mitochondrial ribosomes. Dysfunction of MTIF3 may impair mitochondrial function and dopamine neurons appear to be particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress, which may relate to their degeneration in PD. An association was recently reported between the synonymous rs7669(C>T) in MTIF3 and PD in a German case-control material. We investigated rs7669 in a Swedish Parkinson case-control material. The study revealed no significant association of the individual genotypes or alleles with PD. When comparing the combined TT/CT-genotypes versus the CC-genotype, we observed a significant association (P = .0473) with PD. We also demonstrated that the TT-genotype causes a significant decrease in MTIF3 mRNA expression compared to the CC-genotype (P = .0163). Our findings support the hypothesis that MTIF3 may be involved in the etiology of PD.",

    "abstract": "This study explored the viability and efficacy of integrating cadence-matched, salient music into a walking intervention for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Twenty-two people with PD were randomised to a control (CTRL, n = 11) or experimental (MUSIC, n = 11) group. MUSIC subjects walked with an individualised music playlist three times a week for the intervention period. Playlists were designed to meet subject's musical preferences. In addition, the tempo of the music closely matched (\u00b110-15\u2009bpm) the subject's preferred cadence. CTRL subjects continued with their regular activities during the intervention. The effects of training accompanied by \"walking songs\" were evaluated using objective measures of gait score. The MUSIC group improved gait velocity, stride time, cadence, and motor symptom severity following the intervention. This is the first study to demonstrate that music listening can be safely implemented amongst PD patients during home exercise.",

    "abstract": "A previous study from our laboratory revealed that moderate nigral dopaminergic degeneration caused emotional and cognitive deficits in rats, paralleling early signs of Parkinson's disease. Recent evidence suggests that the blockade of cannabinoid CB(1) receptors might be beneficial to alleviate motor inhibition typical of Parkinson's disease. Here, we investigated whether antagonism of CB(1) receptors would improve emotional and cognitive deficits in a rat model of premotor Parkinson's disease. Depression-like behavior and cognition were assessed with the forced swim test and the social recognition test, respectively. Confirming our previous study, rats injected with 6-hydroxydopamine in striatum presented emotional and cognitive alterations which were improved by acute injection of SR141716A. HPLC analysis of monoamine levels demonstrated alterations in the striatum and prefrontal cortex after SR141716A injection. These findings suggest a role for CB(1) receptors in the early symptoms caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum, as observed in Parkinson's disease.",

However, recent studies have questioned its validity and it is unclear what scores represent. This study explored the possibility of regrouping PDQ-39 items into scales representing the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) components of Body Functions and Structures (BF), Activities and Participation (AP), and Environmental (E) factors. An iterative process using Rasch analysis produced five new items sets, two each for the BF and AP components and one representing E. Four of these were found to represent clinically meaningful variables: Emotional Impairment (BF), Gross Motor Disability (AP), Fine Motor Disability (AP), and Socioattitudinal Environment (E) with acceptable reliability (0.73-0.96) and fit to the Rasch model (total item-trait chi-square, 8.28-33.2; P > .05). These new ICF-based scales offer a means to reanalyze PDQ-39 data from an ICF perspective and to study its health components using a widely available health status questionnaire for people with PD.",

    "abstract": "Thymine is the only nucleotide base which is changed to uracil upon transcription, leaving mRNA less hydrophobic compared to its DNA counterpart. All the 16 codons that contain uracil (or thymine in gene) as the second nucleotide code for the five large hydrophobic residues (LHRs), namely phenylalanine,v isoleucine, leucine, methionine and valine. Thymine content (i.e. the fraction of XTX codons, where X = A, C, G, or T) in PINK1 mRNA sequences and its relationship with protein stability and function are the focus of this work. This analysis will shed light on PINK1's stability, thus a clue can be provided to understand the mitochondrial dysfunction and the failure of oxidative stress control frequently observed in Parkinson's disease. We obtained the complete PINK1 mRNA sequences of 8 different species. The distributions of XTX codons in different frames are calculated. We observed that the thymine content reached the highest level in the coding frame 1 of the PINK1 mRNA sequence of Bos Taurus (Bt), that is peaked at 27%. Coding frame 1 containing low thymine leads to the reduction in LHRs in the corresponding proteins. Therefore, we conjecture that proteins from the other organisms, including Homo sapiens, lost some of their hydrophobicity and became susceptible to dysfunction. Genes such as PINK1 have reduced thymine in the evolutionary process thereby making their protein products potentially being susceptible to instability and causing disease. Adding more hydrophobic residues (thymine) at appropriate places might help conserve important biological functions.",

    "abstract": "The studies on the association between serum cholesterol level and the risks of neurodegenerative diseases risk are debated. Some prospective studies have found that high serum cholesterol may increase the risks of dementia/Alzheimer's disease and ischemic stroke. However, other studies have found no association or a decreased risk of hemorrhagic stroke with increasing levels of serum total cholesterol. Little is known about the association between serum total cholesterol or a history of hypercholesterolemia and Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. Only a few case-control studies and four prospective epidemiological studies have examined this association, but the results are inconsistent. An inverse association between serum total cholesterol and the risk of PD has been found in one prospective study; however, no significant association is reported in the case-control studies and other two prospective studies. Recently, one large prospective study from Finland suggests that high total cholesterol at baseline is associated with an increased risk of PD. Further studies, especially large clinical trials, are needed.",

    "abstract": "Background. Common but seldom published are Parkinson's disease (PD) medication errors involving late, extra, or missed doses. These errors can reduce medication effectiveness and the quality of life of people with PD and their caregivers. Objective. To explore lay perspectives of factors contributing to medication timing errors for PD in hospital and community settings. Design and Methods. This qualitative research purposively sampled individuals with PD, or a proxy of their choice, throughout New Zealand during 2008-2009. Data collection involved 20 semistructured, personal interviews by telephone. A general inductive analysis of the data identified core insights consistent with the study objective. Results. Five themes help to account for possible timing adherence errors by people with PD, their caregivers or professionals. The themes are the abrupt withdrawal of PD medication; wrong, vague or misread instructions; devaluation of the lay role in managing PD medications; deficits in professional knowledge and in caring behavior around PD in formal health care settings; and lay forgetfulness. Conclusions. The results add to the limited published research on medication errors in PD and help to confirm anecdotal experience internationally. They indicate opportunities for professionals and lay people to work together to reduce errors in the timing of medication for PD in hospital and community settings.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the presence of a possible association between handedness and the side of symptom dominance in 963 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In only 287 patients the hand dominance was registered. Out of 254 right-handed patients, 158 (62%) had a right-side dominance of PD symptoms, while 96 patients (38%) had left-lateralized symptom dominance (p < 0.001). For the 33 left-handed subjects, 18 (55%) had left- and 15 (45%) had right-sided symptom dominance (p = 0.602). Right-handedness thus appeared to be associated with right-sided dominance of PD symptoms, while the group of left-handed patients was too small to draw conclusions from. Possible explanations are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Fear of falling (FOF) is common in Parkinson's disease (PD), and it is considered a vital aspect of comprehensive balance assessment in PD. FOF can be conceptualized differently. The Falls-Efficacy Scale (FES) assesses fall-related self-efficacy, whereas the Survey of Activities and Fear of Falling in the Elderly (SAFFE) assesses activity avoidance due to the risk of falling. This study aimed at investigating the validity and reliability of FES and SAFFE in people with PD.\nSeventy-nine people with PD (mean age; 64 years, SD 7.2) completed the Swedish version of FES(S), SAFFE and the physical functioning (PF) scale of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). FES(S) and SAFFE were administered twice, with an 8.8 (SD 2.3) days interval. Assumptions for summing item scores into total scores were examined and score reliability (Cronbach's alpha and test-retest reliability) were calculated. Construct validity was assessed by examining the pattern of Spearman correlations (rs) between the FES(S)/SAFFE and other variables, and by examining differences in FES(S)/SAFFE scores between fallers and non-fallers, genders, and between those reporting FOF and unsteadiness while turning.\nFor both scales, item mean scores (and standard deviations) were roughly similar and corrected item-total correlations exceeded 0.4. Reliabilities were \u2265 0.87. FES(S)-scores correlated strongest (rs, -0.74, p < 0.001) with SAFFE-scores, whereas SAFFE-scores correlated strongest with PF-scores (rs, -0.76, p < 0.001). Both scales correlated weakest with age (rs \u2264 0.08). Experiencing falls, unsteadiness while turning, and FOF was associated with lower fall-related self-efficacy and higher activity avoidance.\nThis study provides initial support for the score reliability and validity of the FES(S) and SAFFE in people with PD.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to evaluate the Chinese version of the eight-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8), through standard psychometric techniques.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 Parkinson's disease patients attending a Movement Disorders Unit. Neurologists' assessments were based on Hoehn and Yahr, Schwab and England and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scales. Patients' self-evaluations included the Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire, the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) and PDQ-8, pain, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Analyses for internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, and construct validity were performed.\nThere was no evidence of floor or ceiling effects. The alpha coefficient was 0.81. Correlation of social support and bodily discomfort with the PDQ-8 was modest (0.46 and 0.36, respectively). PDQ-8 convergent validity with the PDQ-39 was very high (r = 0.96), and known-groups validity proved satisfactory.\nThe results of this study suggest the PDQ-8 is a valid and reliable disease-specific health-related quality-of-life instrument for Parkinson's disease in Taiwan when used independently of the PDQ-39.",

    "abstract": "CD3\u03b6 is a subunit of the CD3 molecule that, until recently, appeared restricted to T cells and natural killer cells. However, experimental studies have demonstrated a role of CD3\u03b6 in dendritic outgrowth in the visual system as well as in synaptic plasticity. Given the increasing evidence for uncharacteristic recapitulation of neurodevelopmental processes in neurodegenerative diseases, in this study, we evaluated brains from subjects with Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia for evidence of aberrant CD3 expression. Our data shows marked CD3\u03b6 in association with the \u03b1-synuclein containing pathological lesions, i.e., Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, in the brains of subjects with Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. This finding raises the novel concept of CD3 dysregulation in these disorders as a pathogenic factor and also furthers the increasing evidence that the recall of aberrant neurodevelopmental processes underlies the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Prospective comparative long-term data on the effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and continuous subcutaneous infusion of apomorphine (CSAI) in patients with advanced Parkinson disease (PD) are lacking. We report 5-year follow-up of 25 PD patients treated with either STN-DBS (n = 13) or CSAI (n = 12) who fulfilled CAPSIT-PD criteria. Cohorts were matched for disease duration and severity of motor complications. Baseline clinical and neuropsychological status did not differ among cohorts. Patients were assessed with the UPDRS, MMSE, HAMD-17 and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).Twelve subjects reached the 5-year follow-up with STN-DBS (one was lost at follow-up) versus two in the CSAI cohort. Drop-outs with CSAI were due to subcutaneous nodules (n = 2), insufficient control of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia (n = 4), death for unrelated reasons (n = 3) and one was lost at follow-up. Average apomorphine dose at last visit was 83.4 \u00b1 19.2 mg/day and average treatment duration was 30 months. At 1-year as well as at last follow-up (intention-to-treat analysis), both therapies decreased daily off-time but only STN-DBS reduced dyskinesia duration and severity. Decrement of medications was greater with STN-DBS. There was a significant worsening of NPI after STN-DBS, primarily because four subjects developed apathy.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative/nitrosative stress plays a crucial role in Parkinson's disease (PD) by triggering mitochondrial dysfunction. Nitrosative stress is mediated by reactive species such as peroxynitrite (PN) which could damage biomolecules thereby impinging on the cellular machinery. We observed that PN (0-1000 \u03bcM) inhibited brain mitochondrial complex I (CI) activity in a dose-dependent manner with concomitant tyrosine nitration of proteins. We also observed that exposure to PN at low concentrations (62.5-125 \u03bcM) significantly decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and affected the mitochondrial integrity at higher doses (500-750 \u03bcM) as indicated by the mitochondrial swelling experiment. Therefore, it could be surmised that compounds that prevent such mitochondrial damage might have therapeutic value in neurological conditions such as PD. We previously showed that curcumin could detoxify PN and protect against CI inhibition and protein nitration. However, the therapeutic potential of curcumin is constrained by limited bioavailability. To address this issue and obtain improved antioxidants, three bioconjugates of curcumin (Di-demethylenated piperoyl, di-valinoyl and di-glutamoyl esters) were generated and tested against PN-mediated nitrosative stress and mitochondrial damage. We found that among the bioconjugates, the glutamoyl diester of curcumin showed improved protection against PN-dependent CI inhibition and protein nitration compared to other conjugates. Di-glutamoyl curcumin protected dopaminergic neurons against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-mediated neuronal death. These effects were improved compared to curcumin alone suggesting that di-glutamoyl curcumin could be a better neuroprotective agent in neurodegenerative diseases such as PD.",

    "abstract": "NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone flavoprotein 2 (NDUFV2), encoding a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, is a candidate gene for several neuronal diseases; schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and Parkinson disease (PD). We screened the entire coding region of NDUFV2 in 33 familial PD patients of North African Arab-Berber ethnicity in which all known genetic forms of PD had been excluded. We detected one novel substitution p.K209R (c.626A>G) in one PD proband. Segregation analysis within the family is inconclusive due to small sample size, but consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Subsequent screening of this mutation in ethnically matched sporadic PD patients (n = 238) and controls (n = 371) identified p.K209R in one additional patient. The clinical features of the mutation carriers revealed a mild form of parkinsonism with a prognosis similar to idiopathic PD. Our findings suggest further studies addressing the role of NDUFV2 variation in PD may be warranted.",

    "abstract": "In an open-label phase 1 trial, gene delivery of the trophic factor neurturin via an adeno-associated type-2 vector (AAV2) was well tolerated and seemed to improve motor function in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of AAV2-neurturin in a double-blind, phase 2 randomised trial.\nWe did a multicentre, double-blind, sham-surgery controlled trial in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) by a central, computer generated, randomisation code to receive either AAV2-neurturin (5\u00b74 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u00b9 vector genomes) injected bilaterally into the putamen or sham surgery. All patients and study personnel with the exception of the neurosurgical team were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to 12 months in the motor subscore of the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale in the practically-defined off state. All randomly assigned patients who had at least one assessment after baseline were included in the primary analyses. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00400634.\nBetween December, 2006, and November, 2008, 58 patients from nine sites in the USA participated in the trial. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint in patients treated with AAV2-neurturin compared with control individuals (difference -0\u00b731 [SE 2\u00b763], 95% CI -5\u00b758 to 4\u00b797; p=0\u00b791). Serious adverse events occurred in 13 of 38 patients treated with AAV2-neurturin and four of 20 control individuals. Three patients in the AAV2-neurturin group and two in the sham surgery group developed tumours.\nIntraputaminal AAV2-neurturin is not superior to sham surgery when assessed using the UPDRS motor score at 12 months. However, the possibility of a benefit with additional targeting of the substantia nigra and longer term follow-up should be investigated in further studies.\nCeregene and Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research.",

    "abstract": "Objective measurements would be useful to document the effect of deep brain stimulation in alleviating rigidity in patients with Parkinson's disease. The aim of the study was to examine the changes of viscoelastic properties in skeletal muscles as indicators of rigidity.\nSix patients in an advanced stage of Parkinson's disease participated in the study. The study took place in the off-medication conditions after one night of drug withdrawal. The wrist rigidity was examined according to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in both sides. Myotonometry (Myoton) was used to determine stiffness and elasticity in extensor digitorum muscles bilaterally. The measurements were repeated and compared during the stimulation-on and stimulation-off periods.\nA comparison of mean clinical motor scores revealed a significant improvement of parkinsonian symptoms due to brain stimulation. In particular, arm rigidity improved on average from 2.83 (1-4) in stimulation-off phase to 1.17 (0-2) in stimulation-on phase (P<0.05). The mean values of elasticity and stiffness were not significantly different in stimulation-on and stimulation-off conditions. The patients with elevated clinical rigidity scores had higher mean values of stiffness (262.5 vs 211.0; P<0.05) but the differences in elasticity were not significant.\nIncreased rigidity is associated with increased values of viscoelastic stiffness. This paper supports the use of myotonometry for objective quantification of rigidity and in the future, this tool could prove helpful for optimizing deep brain stimulation settings in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Consistent functional brain abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD) are difficult to pinpoint because differences from the normal state are often subtle. In this regard, the application of multivariate methods of analysis has been successful but not devoid of misinterpretation and controversy. The Scaled Subprofile Model (SSM), a principal components analysis (PCA)-based spatial covariance method, has yielded critical information regarding the characteristic abnormalities of functional brain organization that underlie PD and other neurodegenerative disorders. However, the relevance of disease-related spatial covariance patterns (metabolic brain networks) and the most effective methods for their derivation has been a subject of debate. We address these issues here and discuss the inherent advantages of proper application as well as the effects of the misapplication of this methodology. We show that ratio pre-normalization using the mean global metabolic rate (GMR) or regional values from a \"reference\" brain region (e.g. cerebellum) that may be required in univariate analytical approaches is obviated in SSM. We discuss deviations of the methodology that may yield erroneous or confounding factors.",

    "abstract": "The past decade in Parkinson's disease (PD) research has been punctuated by numerous advances in understanding genetic factors that contribute to the disease. Common to most of the genetic models of Parkinsonian neurodegeneration are pathologic mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction, secretory vesicle dysfunction and oxidative stress that likely trigger common cell death mechanisms. Whereas presynaptic function is implicated in the function/dysfunction of \u03b1-synuclein, the first gene shown to contribute to PD, synaptic function has not comprised a major focus in most other genetic models. However, recent advances in understanding the impact of mutations in parkin and LRRK2 have also yielded insights into synaptic dysfunction as a possible early pathogenic mechanism. Autophagy is a common neuronal response in each of these genetic models of PD, participating in the clearance of protein aggregates and injured mitochondria. However, the potential consequences of autophagy upregulation on synaptic structure and function remain unknown. In this review, we discuss the evidence that supports a role for synaptic dysfunction in the neurodegenerative cascade in PD, and highlight unresolved questions concerning a potential role for autophagy in either pathological or compensatory synaptic remodeling. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \"Autophagy and protein degradation in neurological diseases.\"",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a major age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a massive and specific loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. The cellular alterations are clinically translated into an invalidating movement disability associated to three canonical symptoms that are bradykinesia, resting tremor and rigidity. The exact causes of this neuronal loss are unknown, but a network of evidences indicates a major contribution of orchestrated cell death processes, also known as apoptosis. Apoptotic cell death is a normal process, the alteration of which triggers several pathologies including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Exhaustive work has been done to delineate the cellular mechanisms responsible for the exacerbated cell death of dopaminergic neurons observed in PD. Overall, the oncogene p53 has been identified as a key effector protein. This review will focus on the clues linking p53 to the etiology of PD and the evidences that this protein may be at the center of multiple signaling cascades not only altered by mutations of various proteins responsible for familial cases of PD but also on more general sporadic cases of this devastating disease.",

    "abstract": "To compare the medication dose reduction between deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (GPi) vs subthalamic nucleus (STN) in matched patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nRecords of 12 patients with PD who underwent GPi-DBS at our institution from 2002 to 2008 were matched by pre-operative PD medication doses and pre-operative motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores to 12 cases of STN-DBS. PD medication doses were converted to levodopa equivalent doses (LEDs).\nGPi and STN groups had similar mean pre-operative LEDs and motor UPDRS scores. At 6 months post-DBS, there was no significant difference in percent reduction in LEDs between the GPi (47.95%) and STN (37.47%) groups (P = 0.52). The mean post-operative 'medication off/stimulation on' motor UPDRS scores did not differ significantly between GPi (15.33) and STN (16.25) groups (P = 0.74). The mean percent reduction in motor UPDRS scores was also similar between GPi (58.44%) and STN (58.98%) patients (P = 0.94).\nWe conclude that in disease-matched patients with PD undergoing DBS, both GPi and STN may result in similar reduction in PD medication doses.",

The current study applied a standardized regression-based (SRB) method based on 20 medically managed PD patients and 20 STN DBS PD surgical patients who were administered the Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Of the medically managed PD participants, 94% remained stable compared to 73% of the DBS group. In the DBS group cognitive change was noted on the Total scale and the Immediate Memory Index. A secondary analysis also revealed reliable change on several subtest scores. Although preliminary, the current study provides change parameters for post DBS surgery on this brief battery.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to a variety of toxins and/or infectious agents leads to disease, degeneration and death, often characterised by circumstances in which cells or tissues do not merely die and cease to function but may be more or less entirely obliterated. It is then legitimate to ask the question as to whether, despite the many kinds of agent involved, there may be at least some unifying mechanisms of such cell death and destruction. I summarise the evidence that in a great many cases, one underlying mechanism, providing major stresses of this type, entails continuing and autocatalytic production (based on positive feedback mechanisms) of hydroxyl radicals via Fenton chemistry involving poorly liganded iron, leading to cell death via apoptosis (probably including via pathways induced by changes in the NF-\u03baB system). While every pathway is in some sense connected to every other one, I highlight the literature evidence suggesting that the degenerative effects of many diseases and toxicological insults converge on iron dysregulation. This highlights specifically the role of iron metabolism, and the detailed speciation of iron, in chemical and other toxicology, and has significant implications for the use of iron chelating substances (probably in partnership with appropriate anti-oxidants) as nutritional or therapeutic agents in inhibiting both the progression of these mainly degenerative diseases and the sequelae of both chronic and acute toxin exposure. The complexity of biochemical networks, especially those involving autocatalytic behaviour and positive feedbacks, means that multiple interventions (e.g. of iron chelators plus antioxidants) are likely to prove most effective. A variety of systems biology approaches, that I summarise, can predict both the mechanisms involved in these cell death pathways and the optimal sites of action for nutritional or pharmacological interventions.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic therapies remain the most efficacious symptomatic treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) but are associated with motor complications, including dyskinesia, and nonmotor complications, such as psychosis, impulse control disorders (ICD), and dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS). Nondopaminergic neurotransmitter systems, including the endocannabinoid system, are probably critical to the development of these complications. The role of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in mediating l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced behaviors was explored in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-lesioned marmoset model of PD. Pharmacodynamic and locomotor effects of the selective FAAH inhibitor [3-(3-carbamoylphenyl)phenyl] N-cyclohexylcarbamate (URB597) were assessed via bioanalytical (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) and behavioral observation approaches. URB597 (3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg p.o.) increased plasma levels of the FAAH substrates N-arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide), N-oleoyl ethanolamide, and N-palmitoyl ethanolamide by 10.3 \u00b1 0.3-, 7.8 \u00b1 0.2-, and 1.8 \u00b1 0.1-fold (mean of URB597 groups \u00b1 S.E.M.), respectively, compared with vehicle (all p < 0.001) 4 h after administration. Treatment with L-DOPA (20 mg/kg s.c.) alleviated parkinsonism but elicited dyskinesia, psychosis-like-behaviors and hyperactivity, a potential correlate of ICD and DDS. During the 2 to 4 h after L-DOPA, corresponding to 4 to 6 h after URB597 administration, URB597 reduced total L-DOPA-induced activity and the magnitude of hyperactivity by 32 and 52%, respectively, to levels equivalent to those seen in normal animals. Treatment with URB597 (10 mg/kg p.o.) did not modify the antiparkinsonian actions of L-DOPA or L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and psychosis. URB597 did not alter plasma L-DOPA levels and was without behavioral effects when administered alone. Inhibition of FAAH may represent a novel approach to reducing L-DOPA-induced side effects, such as ICD and DDS, while maintaining the antiparkinsonian benefits of L-DOPA treatment.",

The sum was then quadrupled and the trustee could decide whether or not to return a portion of the investment. Participants could punish the trustee after they were informed of the trustee's decision. We found that PD patients without ICBs on or off medication punished more often than controls, whereas PD patients with ICBs punished more than controls on medication, but similar to controls off medication. These results suggest a role for dopamine in altruistic punishment decisions in PD patients with impulsive compulsive behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Recent neurochemical studies in postmortem brains of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), PD with dementia (PDD) and age-matched controls revealed significant decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) in striatum, confirming previous studies indicating substantial loss of dopaminergic neurons and terminals. Insoluble \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) was significantly increased in both striata and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), more severe in PDD, probably related to Lewy body (LB) burden discussed as one cause of dementia in PD. Parkin levels frequently related to recessive and young-onset PD were unchanged, suggesting no link to sporadic PD. Novel and most interesting data showed elevated tauopathy in striata of both PD and PDD, associated with increased levels of phosphorylated GSK-3\u03b2 and reduced 20S proteasomal subunits but - despite increased cortical \u03b1Syn - unchanged pTau in IFG, related to increased pGSK-3\u03b2 and decreased 19S proteasome subunits. These data, recently confirmed in PDGF-\u03b1Syn transgenic mice (Haggerty et al., submitted) suggest tauopathy in PD and PDD restricted to the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system and in various animal models of PD show topographic differences from a global tauopathy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (and other tauopathies). Although some of these data are at variance to current neuropathologic findings in PD and PDD, they confirm frequently discussed correlations/overlaps between AD and PD/PDD and synergistic effects of \u03b1Syn, pTau, \u03b2-amyloid, and other pathologic proteins, suggesting a dualism or triad of neurodegeneration, the basic molecular pathogenesis remains to be elucidated.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia have a local renin-angiotensin system and it has been shown that the loss of dopaminergic neurons induced by neurotoxins is amplified by local angiotensin II (AII) via angiotensin type 1 receptors (AT1) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) complex activation. Recent studies have revealed a high degree of counter-regulatory interactions between dopamine and AII receptors in non-neural cells such as renal proximal tubule cells. However, it is not known if this occurs in the basal ganglia. In the striatum and nigra, depletion of dopamine with reserpine induced a significant increase in the expression of AT1, angiotensin type 2 receptors (AT2) and the NADPH subunit p47(phox) , which decreased as dopamine function was restored. Similarly, 6-hydroxydopamine-induced chronic dopaminergic denervation induced a significant increase in expression of AT1, AT2 and p47(phox) , which decreased with L-dopa administration. A significant reduction in expression of AT1 mRNA was also observed after administration of dopamine to cultures of microglial cells. Transgenic rats with very low levels of brain AII showed increased AT1, decreased p47 (phox) and no changes in AT2 expression, whereas mice deficient in AT1 exhibited a decrease in the expression of p47 (phox) and AT2. The administration of relatively high doses of AII (100\u2003nm) decreased the expression of AT1, and the increased expression of AT2 and p47(phox) in primary mesencephalic cultures. The results reveal an important interaction between the dopaminergic and local renin-angiotensin system in the basal ganglia, which may be a major factor in the progression of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is reported as one of the most widely accepted mechanisms of maneb (MB)- and paraquat (PQ)-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration leading to the Parkinson's disease (PD) phenotype. The study investigated the effects of silymarin, an antioxidant of plant origin, and melatonin, an indoleamine produced in all species, in MB- and PQ-induced mouse model of PD. The mice were treated intraperitoneally daily with silymarin (40mg/kg) or melatonin (30mg/kg) along with respective controls for 9wk. Subsets of these animals were also treated with MB (30mg/kg) and PQ (10mg/kg), twice a week, for 9wk, 2hr after silymarin/melatonin treatment. Locomotor activities along with striatal dopamine content, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity, number of degenerating neurons, lipid peroxidation and nitrite content were estimated. Additionally, mRNA expression of vesicular monoamine transporter, cytochrome P-450 2E1 (CYP2E1), and glutathione-S-transferase A4-4 (GSTA4-4), catalytic activities of CYP2E1 and GSTA4-4 and protein expressions of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated p53 (p53 and P-p53), Bax and caspase 9 were measured in control and MB- and PQ-treated mice with either silymarin or melatonin treatments. Silymarin/melatonin significantly offset MB- and PQ-mediated reductions in locomotor activities, dopamine content, TH immunoreactivity, VMAT 2 mRNA expression and the expression of p53 protein. Silymarin/melatonin attenuated the increases in lipid peroxidation, number of degenerating neurons, nitrite content, mRNA expressions of cytochrome P-450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and GSTA4-4, catalytic activities of CYP2E1 and GST and P-p53, Bax and caspase 9 protein expressions. The results demonstrate that silymarin and melatonin offer nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuroprotection against MB- and PQ-induced PD by the modulation of oxidative stress and apoptotic machinery.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of alpha-synuclein (AS) is a critical step in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). A central, unresolved question in the pathophysiology of PD relates to the role of AS-metal interactions in amyloid fibril formation and neurodegeneration. Our previous works established a hierarchy in alpha-synuclein-metal ion interactions, where Cu(II) binds specifically to the protein and triggers its aggregation under conditions that might be relevant for the development of PD. Two independent, non-interacting copper-binding sites were identified at the N-terminal region of AS, with significant difference in their affinities for the metal ion. In this work we have solved unknown details related to the structural binding specificity and aggregation enhancement mediated by Cu(II). The high-resolution structural characterization of the highest affinity N-terminus AS-Cu(II) complex is reported here. Through the measurement of AS aggregation kinetics we proved conclusively that the copper-enhanced AS amyloid formation is a direct consequence of the formation of the AS-Cu(II) complex at the highest affinity binding site. The kinetic behavior was not influenced by the His residue at position 50, arguing against an active role for this residue in the structural and biological events involved in the mechanism of copper-mediated AS aggregation. These new findings are central to elucidate the mechanism through which the metal ion participates in the fibrillization of AS and represent relevant progress in the understanding of the bioinorganic chemistry of PD.",

    "abstract": "Gene therapy represents a potentially useful additional technique to ameliorate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), and the motor complications of its treatment. The neurodegenerative process itself, as well as the non-motor symptoms of PD, both remain less amenable to most of the current gene therapy approaches. This review presents an overview of the four gene therapies in phase I/II clinical trials, outlines some of the challenges they face, and proposes additional alternative strategies that might improve the clinical prospects of gene therapy for PD. In so doing, we hope to highlight the issue of the current absence of effective treatment for non-motor symptoms of PD and the potential of further candidate targets for gene therapy intervention that might improve upon this, for both specific individuals with genetic forms of PD as well as \"sporadic\" PD patients.",

    "abstract": "To date, there is no accepted clinical diagnostic test for Parkinson disease (PD) that is based on biochemical analysis of blood or CSF. The discovery of mutations in the SNCA gene encoding \u03b1-synuclein in familial parkinsonism and the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in the PD brain suggested a critical role for this protein in PD etiology.\nWe investigated total and \u03b1-synuclein oligomers levels in CSF from patients clinically diagnosed with PD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), or Alzheimer disease (AD), and age-matched controls, using ELISA developed in our laboratory.\nThe levels of \u03b1-synuclein oligomers and oligomers/total-\u03b1-synuclein ratio in CSF were higher in the PD group (n = 32; p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test) compared to the control group (n = 28). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) indicated a sensitivity of 75.0% and a specificity of 87.5%, with an AUC of 0.859 for increased CSF \u03b1-synuclein oligomers in clinically diagnosed PD cases. However, when the CSF oligomers/total-\u03b1-synuclein ratio was analyzed, it provided an even greater sensitivity of 89.3% and specificity of 90.6%, with an AUC of 0.948. In another cross-sectional pilot study, we confirmed that the levels of CSF \u03b1-synuclein oligomers were higher in patients with PD (n = 25) compared to patients with PSP (n = 18; p < 0.05) or AD (n = 35; p < 0.001) or control subjects (n = 43; p < 0.05).\nOur results demonstrate that levels of \u03b1-synuclein oligomers in CSF and the oligomers/total-\u03b1-synuclein ratio can be useful biomarkers for diagnosis and early detection of PD.",

    "abstract": "Damage to nonmotor dopamine (DA)-mediated frontostriatal circuits has been proposed as the main pathophysiological basis of cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, 18 early nondemented drug naive PD patients were investigated, by dual-tracer N-\u03c9-fluoropropyl-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-4-[123I]iodophenyl-nortropane ([123I]FP-CIT) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/[18F] fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, to test whether an early and not yet treatment-modulated relation exists between cognitive functions, caudate nucleus (CN) DA impairment and brain metabolism (CMRglc) in associative frontostriatal circuits. Verbal fluency performance correlated with DA impairment in CN, and with CMRglc in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Further, CMRglc in orbitofrontal cortex, DLPFC, and ACC was shown to be early modulated by the level of DA impairment in CN. The present study demonstrates in vivo the early functional disruption of nonmotor frontostriatal circuits in PD. The effect of CN DA impairment on DLPFC and ACC metabolism is proposed as a possible early pathophysiological and functional substrate for executive dysfunction in PD.",

    "abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein is central to the Lewy body neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD), a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by numerous motor and non-motor manifestations. The cardinal motor symptoms are linked to death of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. Here we ask why these neurons are preferentially susceptible to neurodegeneration in PD and how \u03b1-synuclein is involved. To address these questions we bring together recent findings from genome-wide association studies, which reveal the involvement of \u03b1-synuclein gene variants in sporadic PD, with recent studies highlighting important roles for \u03b1-synuclein in synaptic transmission and dopaminergic neuron physiology. These latest advances add to our understanding of PD etiology and provide a central link between the genetic findings and neurodegeneration observed in sporadic PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Levodopa provides the best symptomatic benefit with the fewest short-term adverse effects, but its use is associated with the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. The introduction of dopamine agonists early in the treatment of PD leads to a delay of these motor complications, but all available dopamine agonists may cause profound adverse effects in some patients. The objective of this manuscript is to review the initial treatment, the neurotoxicity of levodopa, the swallowing disturbance and QOL of PD. Levodopa still is the gold standard for PD. However, the treatment decisions should be based on considerations of risks versus benefits for individual patients.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the current study was to examine changes in dopamine D2 receptor (DA-D2R) expression within the basal ganglia of MPTP mice subjected to intensive treadmill exercise. Using Western immunoblotting analysis of synaptoneurosomes and in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging employing the DA-D2R specific ligand [\u00b9\u2078F]fallypride, we found that high intensity treadmill exercise led to an increase in striatal DA-D2R expression that was most pronounced in MPTP compared to saline treated mice. Exercise-induced changes in the DA-D2R in the dopamine-depleted basal ganglia are consistent with the potential role of this receptor in modulating medium spiny neurons (MSNs) function and behavioral recovery. Importantly, findings from this study support the rationale for using PET imaging with [\u00b9\u2078F]fallypride to examine DA-D2R changes in individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) undergoing high-intensity treadmill training.",

    "abstract": "Motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease (PD) can be reduced by intraduodenal infusion of levodopa-carbidopa (Duodopa\u00ae) via percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy (PEG). We applied the transcutaneous soft-tissue anchored titanium port (T-port) in 15 PD patients with motor fluctuations; 7 Duodopa-naive (non-PEG), and 8 previously receiving Duodopa (former-PEG). Motor scores (UPDRS-III) and quality of life (QOL, PDQ-8) were assessed at baseline and 6 month follow-up. Six patients had local irritation shortly after implantation, persisting in one patient at 6 month follow-up, which led to explantation. After having finished the protocol, four T-ports were explanted in total. UPDRS-III and PDQ-8 scores improved moderately in the non-PEG patients, but remained similar in the former-PEG users. Two former-PEG users developed polyneuropathy. No obstructions, retractions, or leakages occurred. Technical and hygienic properties of the T-port were preferred by most patients. The T-port seems to be suitable for most PD patients qualifying for Duodopa therapy, although local infection may lead to explantation during longer-term follow-up.",

    "abstract": "The development of visual hallucinations (VH) is a frequent complication of Parkinson's disease (PD). Presence of hallucinations is one of the main risk factors associated with dementia, and severity progression of VH mainly contributes to impaired quality of life in PD. The neuropsychological features associated with severity progression of VH are unknown and might help to detect patients at risk of a more severe outcome. We aimed to explore the neuropsychological deficits associated with the different types of VH observed in PD, from minor hallucinations to well-formed VH with loss of insight. Prospective study of 57 PD patients with (n = 29) and without VH (n = 28) matched for age, education, antiparkinsonian medications, and disease duration. Description of VH was assessed by the Hallucinations and Psychosis item of the MDS-UPDRS. Cognition was assessed with the Parkinson's Disease-Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS) and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS). Patients with minor VH did not differ from patients without VH in any cognitive domain. PD patients with major VH and insight retained performed worse on the action verbal fluency task (P < 0.04), and patients with VH and loss of insight showed a greater impairment on the PD-CRS posterior cortical score (P = 0.021) and the clock copying item (P = 0.01). A double dissociation was found in the neuropsychological profile of patients with VH with and without loss of insight. While the presence of major VH with insight retained appeared related to a predominant frontal-striatal impairment, loss of insight was characterized by further impairment of cognitive functions related to posterior cortical areas. A comprehensible continuum pattern of clinical relationships emerged among VH and cognitive functioning in PD.",

    "abstract": "The trajectory of cognitive functioning in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is not known. We used a random change point model to study the individual cognitive trajectory for up to 15 years in a prevalence sample of 238 PD patients, and used the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) to assess the longitudinal cognitive course. We observed that the rate of global cognitive decline was nonlinear. Following a relatively stable period, an inflection point was identified, after which the rate of decline gained momentum with an annual decline of 2.8 points on the MMSE. The course was similar in men and women. This inflection point was estimated to occur 13.3 years (95% credible interval 11.8, 13.6) after the diagnosis of PD; however, there were wide interindividual variations in the time from onset of PD to the inflection point.",

    "abstract": "The influence of emotional context on cognitive operations is of fundamental importance for the evolution of higher cognitive functions and their disturbance in neuropsychiatric disorders. The dopamine pathways projecting to prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia are assumed to play a major role in such emotion-cognition interactions. Here we provide evidence for such a role by studying working memory for emotional faces in patients with Parkinson's Disease. We studied 25 patients with Parkinson's disease during their on and off medication states. Faces with emotional expressions (happy, angry, sad, neutral or fearful) were shown and the participants had to remember and later recall the identity of the faces ignoring the expressions. We found that dopaminergic medication enhances working memory for angry faces and suppresses it for sad faces. The results elucidate neurochemical mechanisms for the saliency of threatening information and support cognitive explanations of the antidepressant effects of dopamine. They also suggest a role for dopamine in changing emotional-cognitive biases rather than as a generic cognitive enhancer.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) frequently experience pain that could be in part due to central modification of nociception. In this randomized controlled double blind study, we compared the effect of apomorphine versus placebo on pain thresholds and pain-induced cerebral activity in 25 patients with PD. Subjective pain threshold (using thermal stimulation, thermotest), objective pain threshold (nociceptive flexion reflex), and cerebral activity (H(2)(15)O PET) during noxious and innocuous stimulations were performed. Neither subjective nor objective pain thresholds nor pain activation profile were modified by apomorphine compared with placebo in 25 PD patients. Apomorphine has no effect on pain processing in PD. We suggest that other monoamine systems than dopaminergic system could be involved.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder typified by the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Recent evidence indicates that neuroinflammation may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of PD, particularly tumor necrosis factor (TNF). We have previously shown that soluble TNF (solTNF) is required to mediate robust degeneration induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or lipopolysaccharide. What remains unknown is whether TNF inhibition can attenuate the delayed and progressive phase of neurodegeneration. To test this, rats were injected in the SNpc with lentivirus encoding dominant-negative TNF (lenti-DN-TNF) 2 weeks after receiving a 6-OHDA lesion. Remarkably, when examined 5 weeks after the initial 6-OHDA lesion, no further loss of nigral DA neurons was observed. Lenti-DN-TNF also attenuated microglial activation. Together, these data suggest that TNF is likely a critical mediator of nigral DA neuron death during the delayed and progressive phase of neurodegeneration, and that microglia may be the principal cell type involved. These promising findings provide compelling reasons to perform DN-TNF gene transfer studies in nonhuman primates with the long-term goal of using it in the clinic to prevent the delayed and progressive degeneration of DA neurons that gives rise to motor symptoms in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease associated with farming and exposure to agricultural chemicals has been reported in numerous studies; little is known about Parkinson disease risk factors for those living in urban areas. The authors investigated the relation between copper, lead, or manganese emissions and Parkinson disease incidence in the urban United States, studying 29 million Medicare beneficiaries in the year 2003. Parkinson disease incidence was determined by using beneficiaries who had not changed residence since 1995. Over 35,000 nonmobile incident Parkinson disease cases, diagnosed by a neurologist, were identified for analysis. Age-, race-, and sex-standardized Parkinson disease incidence was compared between counties with high cumulative industrial release of copper, manganese, or lead (as reported to the Environmental Protection Agency) and counties with no/low reported release of all 3 metals. Parkinson disease incidence (per 100,000) in counties with no/low copper/lead/manganese release was 274.0 (95% confidence interval (CI): 226.8, 353.5). Incidence was greater in counties with high manganese release: 489.4 (95% CI: 368.3, 689.5) (relative risk = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.54, 2.07) and counties with high copper release: 304.2 (95% CI: 276.0, 336.8) (relative risk = 1.1, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.31). Urban Parkinson disease incidence is greater in counties with high reported industrial release of copper or manganese. Environmental exposure to metals may be a risk factor for Parkinson disease in urban areas.",

    "abstract": "In the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, increased lipid peroxidation, decreased activities of the mitochondrial complex I of the respiratory chain, catalase and glutathione-peroxidase, and decreased levels of reduced glutathione have been reported. These observations suggest that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction play a role in the neurodegeneration in PD. We assessed enzymatic activities of respiratory chain and other enzymes involved in oxidative processes in skin fibroblasts cultures of patients with PD.\nWe studied respiratory chain enzyme activities, activities of total, Cu/Zn- and Mn-superoxide-dismutase, gluthatione-peroxidase and catalase, and coenzyme Q10 levels in skin fibroblasts cultures from 20 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and 19 age- and sex- matched healthy controls.\nWhen compared with controls, PD patients showed significantly lower specific activities for complex V (both corrected by citrate synthase activity and protein concentrations). Oxidized, reduced and total coenzyme Q10 levels (both corrected by citrate synthase and protein concentrations), and activities of total, Cu/Zn- and Mn-superoxide-dismutase, gluthatione-peroxidase and catalase, did not differ significantly between PD-patients and control groups. Values for enzyme activities in the PD group did not correlate with age at onset, duration, scores of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating scales and Hoehn-Yahr staging.\nThe main result of this study was the decreased activity of complex V in PD patients. This complex synthesizes ATP from ADP using an electrochemical gradient generated by complexes I-IV. These results suggest decreased energetic metabolism in fibroblasts of patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "A large genome-wide association study has shown that the \"leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) domain-containing, Nogo receptor-interacting protein-1 (LINGO1) gene\" is associated with an increased risk for essential tremor (ET) recently. Given the clinical phenotype overlap between Parkinson's disease (PD) and ET, and LINGO1 had also been demonstrated to play roles in the structural plasticity and integrity of the DA neurons as well as survival of dopaminergic neurons in PD animal models, it has been suggested that the LINGO1 variant could be associated with PD. Here, we report the first analysis of the LINGO1 variant rs9652490 (A\u2009>\u2009G) in two independent case-control cohorts in ethnic Chinese populations involving a total of 1,305 subjects (649 PD patients and 656 controls) from Taiwan and Singapore. We were unable to demonstrate any significant association between genotype distribution and allele frequency with risk of PD in each case-control study and in the pooled analysis. Further meta-analysis including all published data and ours failed to demonstrate any modulatory role of rs9652490 GG genotype or G allele. LINGO1 variant rs9652490 (A\u2009>\u2009G) is unlikely to play a major role in PD in our Chinese populations.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to assess how the non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), such as depression, cognitive deterioration, neuropsychiatric and sleep disorders, affect the quality of life, and to compare them with the motor symptoms in order to determine their real impact. A cross-sectional study was designed including 99 patients (mean age 68.5 \u00b1 9.9 years, duration of disease 8.7 \u00b1 6.2 years). Demographic data, onset of PD, years on treatment with levodopa (LD), class of dopaminergic drug prescribed, and dosages were obtained. The following scales were used: quality of life (PDQ-39), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS I-IV), Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) and daytime sleepiness (Epworth), Mini-Mental State Examination, depression (HAM-D), and the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI-10). The PDQ-39 summary index (PDQ-39 SI) was 24.7 \u00b1 13.2. A linear regression model including all variables showed that four independent variables accounted for 67.2% of the variance in the PDQ-39 SI (F = 33,277; p < 0.001): NPI, PDSS, UPDRS IV, and UPDRS I. When sub-items of the NPI, PDSS and UPDRS IV scales are analyzed, significant correlations (p < 0.001) are found between the PDQ-39 SI and depression, agitation, apathy, anxiety, hallucinations, delusions, incontinence of urine, morning painful posturing, restlessness in bed, morning fatigue, duration of off periods, unpredictable and predictable off periods, early morning dystonia, and sudden off periods. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially depression, nighttime sleep disorders such as urinary incontinence, nighttime restlessness, morning fatigue and somnolence, off-period dystonia and motor fluctuations are the variables that most affect the quality of life of patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Central pathophysiological pathways of basal ganglia dysfunction imply a disturbed interaction of dopaminergic and cholinergic circuits. In Parkinson's disease (PD) imbalanced cholinergic hyperactivity prevails in the striatum. Interruption of acetylcholine (ACh) release in the striatum by locally injected botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT-A) has been studied in the rat 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of PD (hemi-PD). The hemi-PD was induced by injection of 6-OHDA into the right medial forebrain bundle. Motor dysfunction provoked by apomorphine-induced contralateral rotation was completely reversed for more than 3 months by ipsilateral intrastriatal application of 1-2 ng BoNT-A. Interestingly, BoNT-A injected alone into the right striatum of na\u00efve rats caused a slight transient ipsilateral apomorphine-induced rotation, which lasted only for about one month. Immunohistochemically, large axonal swellings appeared within the striatum injected with BoNT-A, which we tentatively named BoNT-A-induced varicosities. They contained either choline acetyltransferase or tyrosine hydroxylase. These findings suggest a selective inhibition of evoked release of ACh by locally applied BoNT-A. Intrastriatal application of BoNT-A may antagonize localized relative functional disinhibited hypercholinergic activity in neurodegenerative diseases such as PD avoiding side effects of systemic anti-cholinergic treatment.",

    "abstract": "A review of the literature highlights the important role informal carers play in the provision of palliative care in the community. In order to explore the caring experience of relatives with Parkinson's Disease (PD), interviews were conducted with 26 informal family caregivers. Interviews were taped, transcribed and subjected to content analysis. All caregivers were spouses, the majority female (n\u2009=\u200917) and all were responsible for providing physical, social and emotional care in the home. Although they viewed care giving as their role and duty, the results highlight the widespread burden of providing care on the emotional and physical health of the caregivers. The financial implications for providing care were outlined, with many reporting difficulty in accessing benefits. From the point of diagnosis, which had a huge emotional impact on relatives and carers, carers did not feel health professionals integrated them within the caring journey. Since diagnosis, carers commented on the lack of continued and coordinated care plans for relatives, resulting in symptoms being mismanaged and care opportunities for relatives and carers missed. Stereotypes of the meaning and timing of palliative care were common with many viewing it as being synonymous with cancer and not applicable to a person with PD. As the well-being of the informal carer directly influences the care of the person with PD, support interventions are required to relieve their burden, maximize outcomes and ensure targeting of services.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) impacts several domains of functioning, some of which may be neglected when designing treatment or evaluating outcome using current clinical standards. We therefore argue that taking the patients' perspectives of their condition may allow for a more in-depth assessment of patient goals and subsequent tailoring of care.\nOne hundred and forty-eight patients with idiopathic PD completed a modified version of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Questionnaire (PCOQ-PD), to evaluate treatment success and expectations from the patient's perspective across 10 motor and non-motor functional domains. We also examined patient subgroups based on importance of improvement in various domains.\nPatients' ratings suggested there was substantial variation in functional interference that was generally unrelated to demographic variables. On average, across all domains, patients indicated a 50.32% reduction in symptoms would be successful (range\u00a0=\u00a040.63-58.23%), regardless of treatment experience.

We aimed to assess whether such CSF-genetic endophenotypes are also present in Parkinson disease (PD). CSF tau, phospho-tau and A\u03b2 levels were obtained from 38 PD patients (19 with dementia) using specific ELISA techniques. All cases were genotyped for a series of tau gene polymorphisms (rs1880753, rs1880756, rs1800547, rs1467967, rs242557, rs2471738 and rs7521). The A-allele rs242557 polymorphism was the only tau gene variant significantly associated with higher CSF tau and phospho-tau levels, under both dominant and dose-response model. This association depended on the presence of dementia, and was only observed in individuals with low (<500pg/mL) CSF A\u03b2 levels. Such genetic-CSF endophenotypes are probably a reflection of the presence of AD-like molecular changes in part of PD patients in the setting of dementia.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with episodic memory deficits, but their exact nature is unclear. Some dual-process studies have suggested that recollection is impaired and familiarity is spared in PD, yet others have found the opposite. Our goal was to investigate these memory processes in PD and determine whether the inconsistency among existing findings is related to differences in encoding conditions. We used a process-dissociation procedure with word pairs to estimate familiarity and recollection. In Experiment 1, we used a directed, deep, relational encoding condition (i.e., sentence generation), and in Experiment 2, we contrasted this encoding condition with a shallower, non-directed encoding condition (i.e., read condition). We found a double dissociation as a function of the encoding task: In the sentence generation encoding condition, recollection was impaired in the PD patients, but familiarity was spared. In contrast, in the read encoding condition, there was no group difference in recollection, but familiarity was impaired in the PD group. Within-subject comparisons revealed that both control and PD participants benefitted from the provision of a directed, deep relational encoding strategy. However, this benefit was manifested as an increase in recollection in the controls, but an increase in familiarity in the PD patients. These findings help to reconcile the extant literature and suggest that episodic memory deficits in PD are two-fold, involving: (1) difficulties instantiating encoding strategies independently, leading to deficits in familiarity, and (2) impaired recollection when encoding strategies are equated across groups. Our results highlight the importance of controlling encoding conditions between groups and of taking account of other variables that may influence the participants' performance, such as deficits associated with normal aging, which may mask deficits in neurodegenerative diseases in particular situations. More generally, our study raises the possibility that deficits in recollection or familiarity in patient populations are not immutably linked to the structure that is affected, as is typically assumed, but that such deficits may interact with type of encoding, and possibly with the nature of the retrieval process.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetry of symptoms of Parkinson's disease is clinically most evident for appendicular impairments. For axial impairments such as freezing of gait, asymmetry is less obvious. To date, asymmetries in balance control in PD patients have seldom been studied. Therefore, in this study we investigated whether postural control can be asymmetrically affected in mild to moderate PD patients. Seventeen PD patients were instructed to stand as still and symmetrically as possible on a dual force-plate during two trials. Dynamic postural asymmetry was assessed by comparing the centre-of-pressure velocities between both legs. Results showed that four patients (24%) had dynamic postural asymmetry, even after correcting for weight-bearing asymmetry. Hence, this study suggests that postural control can be asymmetrical in early PD. However, future studies should investigate the prevalence of dynamic postural asymmetry, in a larger group of PD patients. It should also be further investigated whether this approach can be used as a tool to support the initial diagnosis or monitor disease progression, or as an outcome measure for interventions aimed at improving balance in PD.",

    "abstract": "Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is used routinely in clinical practice for the treatment of neutropenia and to increase generation of hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow donors. A growing body of literature on the neurotrophic effects of G-CSF has led to clinical trials in stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe primary objective of this study was to determine if G-CSF administration would rescue the nigro-striatal system and restore locomotor function after completion of a sub-acute course of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) administration (30mg/kg i.p. for 5 days) in 12 month-old mice. A secondary aim was to determine if G-CSF affects the neuro-inflammatory response by modulating microglial activation in striatum and midbrain.\nMPTP-treated mice were impaired on the rotometer test after the last dose of the toxicant and remained impaired until euthanasia. MPTP-treated mice that were given an 8-day regimen of G-CSF starting 2 days after the last dose of toxicant enhanced motor performance compared to the MPTP alone group. MPTP treatment depleted striatal DA (DA) levels; G-CSF given after MPTP resulted in a partial, significant repletion of DA levels. Total microglial burden in the striatum was increased significantly in MPTP-treated mice and was reduced after G-CSF rescue.\nG-CSF enhances recovery of DA nigro-striatal function from MPTP toxicity in part by modulating the microglial response to injury. The G-CSF receptor may provide a novel target for modifying the disease process in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) to reserpine-induced Parkinsonism was evaluated in mice. A battery of motor tests revealed that reserpine caused dose-dependent and long-lasting motor impairment. Endogenous N/OFQ sustained this response because N/OFQ peptide (NOP) receptor knockout (NOP(-/-) ) mice were less susceptible to the hypokinetic action of reserpine than wild-type (NOP(+/+) ) animals. Microdialysis revealed that reserpine elevated glutamate and reduced GABA levels in substantia nigra reticulata, and that resistance to reserpine in NOP(-/-) mice was accompanied by a milder increase in glutamate and lack of inhibition of GABA levels. To substantiate this genetic evidence, the NOP receptor antagonist 1-[(3R,4R)-1-cyclooctylmethyl-3-hydroxymethyl-4-piperidyl]-3-ethyl-1,3-dihydro-2H benzimidazol-2-one (J-113397) simultaneously reduced akinesia and nigral glutamate levels in reserpinized NOP(+/+) mice, being ineffective in NOP(-/-) mice. Moreover, repeated J-113397 administration in reserpinized mice resulted in faster recovery of baseline motor performance which was, however, accompanied by a loss of acute antiakinetic response. The short-term beneficial effect of J-113397 was paralleled by normalization of nigral glutamate levels, whereas loss of acute response was paralleled by loss of the ability of J-113397 to inhibit glutamate levels. We conclude that endogenous N/OFQ contributes to reserpine-induced Parkinsonism, and that sustained NOP receptor blockade produces short-term motor improvement accompanied by normalization of nigral glutamate release.",

    "abstract": "Rivastigmine is approved in the USA for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Executive function (EF) deficits are a core symptom of PDD. The current objective was to investigate the effects of rivastigmine capsules versus placebo on EF in PDD, focusing on secondary outcome measures from a large, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week trial (EXPRESS, CENA713B2311).\nSecondary outcomes included Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) measures of EF. Data from three D-KEFS subtests (Card Sorting, Letter Fluency, Color-Word Interference), plus the Symbol Digit Modalities Test were analyzed in the observed case (OC) population. Changes from baseline in the rivastigmine versus placebo groups were evaluated using the van Elteren test blocking for country.\nOf 541 patients in the EXPRESS study, 402, 71, 97, and 65 patients provided data for Letter Fluency, Card Sorting and Color-Word Interference subtests, and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, respectively. On Letter Fluency, rivastigmine was associated with improvements in correct responses, set loss errors, and responses made (all P < 0.05), but not repetition errors. Higher Card Sorting recognition description score (P= 0.03), and more correct substitutions on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (P= 0.02) were also recorded.\nRivastigmine was associated with significant improvements over placebo on EF tests evaluating flexibility of thinking, problem solving and planning in patients with PDD. These findings support the hypothesis that rivastigmine may affect frontal subcortical circuits, which potentially contributes to observed clinical improvement associated with EF.",

The training program was divided into three phases (A\u2081-B-A\u2082): treadmill training with additional body load (A\u2081), control condition (conventional physical therapy group; B) and a second period of treadmill training with load (A\u2082). Each phase lasted six weeks. Quality of life and motor function were assessed by the PDQ-39 and the motor score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), respectively. The evaluations and the training were performed during the on-phase of the medication cycle.\nThere was improvement in the total PDQ-39 score across the training period. The subscores mobility, activities of daily living and cognition subscores significantly improved after the training period. The improvement in the total score was associated with motor and non-motor factors in all of the training phases. The UPDRS motor score also improved, however it did not present any association with the improvement in quality of life.\nThe results showed that the treadmill-walking training with additional body load allowed an improvement in motor and non-motor aspects related to quality of life and motor function in subjects with PD.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials have demonstrated positive proof of efficacy of dual metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) agonists in both anxiety and schizophrenia. Importantly, evidence suggests that these drugs may also be neuroprotective against glutamate excitotoxicity, implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, whether this neuroprotection also translates into functional recovery is unclear. In the current study, we examined the neuroprotective efficacy of the dual mGluR2/3 agonist, 2R,4R-4-aminopyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (2R,4R-APDC), and whether this is accompanied by behavioral recovery in a rodent 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of PD. We now report that delayed post lesion treatment with 2R,4R-APDC (10\u2009nmol), results in robust neuroprotection of the nigrostriatal system, which translated into functional recovery as measured by improved forelimb use asymmetry and reduced (+)-amphetamine-induced rotation compared to vehicle treated animals. Interestingly, these beneficial effects were associated with a decrease in microglial markers in the SNc, which may suggest an antiinflammatory action of this drug.",

Methods. Twenty-eight patients with PD and 32 controls with chronic disease were assessed with a battery of neuropsychologic, personality, mood, and social function tests. Results. Patients' estimates of their own social functioning were not significantly different from examiners' estimates. The impact of clinical variables on social functioning in PD revealed depression to be the strongest association of social functioning in PD on both the patient and the examiner version of the Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale. Conclusions. PD patients appear to be well aware of their social strengths and weaknesses. Depression and motor symptom severity are significant predictors of both self- and examiner reported social functioning in patients with PD. Assessment and treatment of depression in patients with PD may improve social functioning and overall quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. Abnormalities of posture represent one of the main features of Parkinson's disease (PD). Among them, camptocormia has been considered as rare in PD. We investigated frequency and clinical features of camptocormia in PD patients. Methods. 153 PD patients (mean 68.5 \u00b1 10.7 years old, duration 5.9 \u00b1 2.4 years) outpatiently recruited. After neurologic examination, patients were rated on the Unified PD Rating Scale motor scale (UPDRS Part III), minimental state examination (MMSE). Also we evaluated patients with camptocormia by MRI. Of the 153 PD patients, 27 had camptocormia (mean age, 67.9 \u00b1 7.9 years old; disease duration, 6.1 \u00b1 3.9 years). For further evaluation, we recruited age- and sex-matched 27 PD patients without camptocormia (11 men and 16 women; mean age \u00b1\u2009\u2009SD, 69.2 \u00b1 10.1 years, duration 6.0 \u00b1 2.7 years) These selected 54 patients completed several self-assessments. Lumbar and thoracic paraspinal muscles were studied by EMG. Results. There were no significant differences in age, duration, severity, and drug dose between patients with and without camptocormia. Analysis of NMSS subitems indicated that PD patients tended to show lower scores for sleep/fatigue, attention/memory, and miscellaneous items. Conclusions. We found significant differences concerning nonmotor signs and symptoms evaluated by FAB, PDQ-8, FSQ, VAS-F, and NMSS between patients with and without camptocormia. Our findings indicate that camptocormia is a relatively common sign in PD and that patients with camptocormia scores on the PDQ-8 compared with PD patients without camptocormia. This suggests that improvements in camptocormia of PD patients may improve their QOL.",

    "abstract": "The minimal detectable change (MDC) is the smallest amount of difference in individual scores that represents true change (beyond random measurement error). The MDCs of the Timed \"Up & Go\" Test (TUG) and the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) in people with Parkinson disease (PD) are largely unknown, limiting the interpretability of the change scores of both measures.\nThe purpose of this study was to estimate the MDCs of the TUG and the DGI in people with PD.\nThis investigation was a prospective cohort study.\nSeventy-two participants were recruited from special clinics for movement disorders at a university hospital. Their mean age was 67.5 years, and 61% were men. All participants completed the TUG and the DGI assessments twice, about 14 days apart. The MDC was calculated from the standard error of measurement. The percentage MDC (MDC%) was calculated as the MDC divided by the mean of all scores for the sample. Furthermore, the intraclass correlation coefficient was used to examine the reproducibility between testing sessions (test-retest reliability).\nThe respective MDC and MDC% of the TUG were 3.5 seconds and 29.8, and those of the DGI were 2.9 points and 13.3. The test-retest reliability values for the TUG and the DGI were high; the intraclass correlation coefficients were .80 and .84, respectively.\nThe study sample was a convenience sample, and the participants had mild to moderately severe PD.\nThe results showed that the TUG and the DGI have generally acceptable random measurement error and test-retest reliability. These findings should help clinicians and researchers determine whether a change in an individual patient with PD is a true change.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic variants in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) encoding the enzyme deficient in Gaucher's disease (GD) are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). To investigate the sequence variants, their association with PD and the related phenotypes in a large cohort of European, mostly French, patients and controls, we sequenced all exons of GBA in 786 PD patients from 525 unrelated multiplex families, 605 patients with apparently sporadic PD and 391 ethnically matched controls. GBA mutations were significantly more frequent (odds ratio=6.98, 95% confidence interval 2.54-19.21; P=0.00002) in the PD patients (76/1130=6.7%) than in controls (4/391=1.0%) and in patients with family histories of PD (8.4%) than in isolated cases (5.3%). Twenty-eight different mutations were identified in patient and control groups, including seven novel variants. N370S and L444P accounted for 70% of all mutant alleles in the patient group. PD patients with GBA mutations more frequently had bradykinesia as the presenting symptom and levodopa-induced dyskinesias. The phenotype was similar in patients with one, two or complex GBA mutations, although the two patients with c.1263del+RecTL and N370S/Rec\u039455 mutations had signs of GD. Segregation analyses in 21 multiplex families showed that 17% of the affected relatives did not carry GBA mutations found in the given family, indicating heterogeneity of the aetiology, but 46% of the unaffected relatives were GBA mutation carriers. These genotype and clinical analyses on the largest homogeneous sample of European patients studied to date confirmed that GBA mutations are the most common genetic risk factor for PD, particularly in familial forms.",

    "abstract": "Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is a serum arylsulfatase that metabolizes organophosphate pesticides and protects low-density lipoprotein from oxidation. Case-control studies of PON1 genetic variants in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) have revealed some positive albeit inconsistent associations with 2 PON1 coding polymorphisms: Q192R (rs662) and L55M (rs854560). Because AD and PD exist along a spectrum of disorders with shared epidemiologic, clinical, and pathologic features, here we evaluated PON1 variants in a cohort of 746 AD, 566 PD, 132 AD-PD, and 719 cognitively normal age-matched controls. In the combined AD and Caucasian PD cohorts we had 80% power to detect a relative risk of at least 1.25 and 1.35, respectively, for each polymorphism. We found no association between 2 PON1 coding polymorphisms and AD in African Americans or Caucasians, and no association with PD or AD-PD in Caucasians. There was also no evidence of an interaction between PON1 and apolipoprotein E for any of these diseases. Our results suggest that either these functional PON1 polymorphisms are not associated with AD and PD spectrum disorders, or that the relative risk conferred is small.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a chronic, neurodegenerative disease characterized by gait abnormalities. Freezing of gait (FOG), an episodic inability to generate effective stepping, is reported as one of the most disabling and distressing parkinsonian symptoms. While there are no specific therapies to treat FOG, some external physical cues may alleviate these types of motor disruptions. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential effect of continuous physical cueing using robot-assisted sensorimotor gait training on reducing FOG episodes and improving gait.\nFour individuals with Parkinson's disease and FOG symptoms received ten 30-minute sessions of robot-assisted gait training (Lokomat) to facilitate repetitive, rhythmic, and alternating bilateral lower extremity movements. Outcomes included the FOG-Questionnaire, a clinician-rated video FOG score, spatiotemporal measures of gait, and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 quality of life measure.\nAll participants showed a reduction in FOG both by self-report and clinician-rated scoring upon completion of training. Improvements were also observed in gait velocity, stride length, rhythmicity, and coordination.\nThis pilot study suggests that robot-assisted gait training may be a feasible and effective method of reducing FOG and improving gait. Videotaped scoring of FOG has the potential advantage of providing additional data to complement FOG self-report.",

    "abstract": "This paper is a report of an exploration of patients' lifeworld and way of managing life with advanced Parkinson's disease prior to Deep Brain Stimulation and what they expect from life following this treatment.\nParkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, which is initially well-treated with L-dopa. Living with Parkinson's disease means living with the experience of continuous loss of independence and self-esteem and unpredictable ON/OFF phenomena. Thus, in the advanced stage of the disease, treatment with Deep Brain Stimulation may become relevant.\nEleven patients eligible for Deep Brain Stimulation were interviewed prior to treatment. Data were collected in 2007 and analysed according to the hermeneutic phenomenological methodology of van Manen, using the four existentials as analytic tools.\nLiving with advanced Parkinson's disease can be described as the experience of living with and managing unpredictability. The disease gradually took over, and participants had to struggle with unpredictability on a daily basis. Themes in relation to this were: The body - setting the agenda, Always a struggle to be on time, Living in dependence and compromise - being a burden, and Living with restrained space and changes in social life.\nParkinson's disease leads to profound bodily restrictions. Living with an unpredictable body affects all aspects of life, and nurses need to be aware of the impact the disease has on the entire lifeworld, and how this may affect the way treatment is perceived.",

This has raised the hopes of venture capital investors, who may be able to better navigate the stormy and risky sea of early-stage life science investments, to find a way out of the current funding crisis for novel, nonvalidated drugs and their clinical development. The following survey paints a snapshot of the current perception of biomarkers as a paradigm changer in the eyes of the venture capital community.",

    "abstract": "Although Parkinson's disease was long considered a nongenetic disorder, it is now clear that there are multiple predisposing genes, and that the disorder can exhibit either Mendelian or non-Mendelian modes of inheritance. The identification of several of these genes has provided important insights into the pathogenesis of this common complex disorder. This article presents an overview of the genes associated with autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease, including Parkin (PARK2), PINK1 (PARK6), DJ1 (PARK7) and ATP13A2 (PARK9). Recently, it was recognized that mutations in the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, are associated with an increased incidence of parkinsonism. While Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder, patients with Parkinson's disease can be Gaucher heterozygotes or homozygotes. Elucidating the basis for this association may shed light on new disease mechanisms that contribute to the development of parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "A growing number of studies have correlated higher urate levels with a lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD) and with a favorable rate of disease progression, indicating that urate could be an important biomarker of the pathophysiology underlying PD. Dietary and genetic determinants of urate have also been linked to a reduced risk or delayed onset of PD. Based on the known antioxidant and metal complexing properties of urate, together with evidence for oxidative stress as a contributor to neurodegeneration in PD, urate may serve as an endogenous neuroprotectant that helps reduce the risk and rate of the disease. In this article we review the convergent biological, epidemiological and clinical data that identify urate as a promising biomarker of the risk, diagnosis and prognosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "The dopamine transporter (DAT) is responsible for clearance of dopamine from the synaptic cleft after its release. Imaging DAT availability provides a measure of dopamine terminal function and a method for detecting striatal dopamine deficiency states present in idiopathic Parkinson's disease and atypical neurodegenerative Parkinsonian disorders such as multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy. DAT imaging with PET or single photon emission computed tomography can be used to support a diagnosis of dopamine-deficient parkinsonism in cases where this is suspected and rationalize the use of dopaminergic agents as therapy. It can also detect subclinical dopaminergic dysfunction when present in subjects at risk of Parkinson's disease, such as relatives of patients, susceptibility gene mutation carriers, and subjects with late-onset hyposmia or sleep disorders. Finally, the presence of normal DAT availability on imaging can help exclude nondopamine-deficient syndromes, such as dystonic and severe essential tremors, drug-induced and psychogenic parkinsonism that, on occasion, mimic Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "We performed a cross-sectional study of 82 Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) enrolled during an 18-month period using a clinical interview to assess the prevalence of nonmotor symptoms (NMS), the association with disease severity and motor status, and the impact on patients' health-related quality of life (Hr-QoL). The patients' NMS, Hr-QoL, disease severity, and motor status were assessed by the Nonmotor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), the modified Hoehn and Yahr staging scale (H&Y) and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS III), respectively. We found that 100% of patients with PD presented with NMS. The NMSS significantly correlated with disease duration (Spearman's r(S) = 0.276, P = 0.012), H&Y (r(S) = 0.230, P = 0.038), and UPDRS III (r(S) = 0.350, P = 0.001). Similarly, the PDQ-39 SI significantly associated with the disease duration (r(S) = 0.258, P = 0.019), H&Y (r(S) = 0.340, P = 0.002), and UPDRS III (r(S) = 0.453, P < 0.001). NMS domains that influenced the PDQ-39 SI were sleep/fatigue, mood, gastrointestinal, urinary, and miscellaneous symptoms. This strongly suggested that the five domains played a key role in the manifestation of Hr-QoL. NMSS explains more of the variability in Hr-QoL than UPDRS III, when both are the model (stepwise multiple linear regression analysis R\u00b2 change, 47.8% vs. 5.87%, respectively). Therefore, these findings demonstrate that NMS are independently and negatively associated with Hr-QoL in PD and that improving NMS should be viewed as an important part in the management of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsonian speakers show a tendency to articulatory acceleration and have difficulties to keep the steady pace of repeated syllables. The aim of this study was to analyse the stability of motor speech performance based upon a syllable repetition paradigm during the course of disease to find a potential marker of disease progression in Parkinson's disease (PD). 58 patients with PD and 35 controls were tested and re-tested after at least 12 months (mean: 33.40/range: 12-88). In the PD group, motor impairment was similar at first and second visit. Participants had to repeat the syllable /pa/ in a self chosen steady pace. Percental coefficient of variance (COV) of interval length was measured for description of pace stability throughout the performance. Percental pace acceleration (%PA) was based upon a comparison of the speed of syllable repetition in the first and second half of the task. Patients with PD showed a significant elevation of COV and %PA indicating an instability of syllable repetition and a tendency to pace acceleration in the course of performing. Furthermore, in the PD group, COV and %PA showed a significant deterioration from first to second examination. Instability of steady syllable repetition in PD shows characteristic changes during the course of the disease, but no correlation with general motor impairment. Therefore, the underlying mechanism may be independent from dopaminergic deficits. The potential role of impaired syllable repetition as a marker of non-dopaminergic disease progression in PD needs validation by further studies.",

    "abstract": "To examine whether there is a differential genetic susceptibility in the diphasic and peak-dose forms of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The study cohort comprised 503 unrelated Korean PD patients who were treated with levodopa and had a disease duration of at least 5 years. The presence of LID was identified during a routine follow-up and special care was taken to separate the two distinct forms of LID into diphasic and peak-dose dyskinesias (PDSK). Genotyping was performed in the 503 patients and in 559 healthy controls to search for polymorphisms of DRD3 p.S9G, DRD2 Taq1A, GRIN2B c.2664C>T, c.366C>G, c.-200T>G, and the promoter region of SLC6A4. A total of 229 patients expressed LID (peak-dose in 205, diphasic in 57, and both in 33). The presence of diphasic dyskinesia (DDSK) was exclusively associated with the DRD3 p.S9G variant after adjusting for gender, age at PD onset, Hoehn & Yahr stage, and duration of levodopa treatment. Carrying the AA genotype was likely to shorten the onset of DDSK according to the duration of levodopa therapy (P = 0.02). The presence of PDSK was not significantly associated with any of the six genetic variants studied. There may be a genetic susceptibility in the development of DDSK in PD patients on chronic levodopa therapy, and its underlying pathophysiological mechanism might be distinct from that of PDSK.",

    "abstract": "Progressive loss of the ascending dopaminergic projection in the basal ganglia is a fundamental pathological feature of Parkinson's disease. Studies in animals and humans have identified spatially segregated functional territories in the basal ganglia for the control of goal-directed and habitual actions. In patients with Parkinson's disease the loss of dopamine is predominantly in the posterior putamen, a region of the basal ganglia associated with the control of habitual behaviour. These patients may therefore be forced into a progressive reliance on the goal-directed mode of action control that is mediated by comparatively preserved processing in the rostromedial striatum. Thus, many of their behavioural difficulties may reflect a loss of normal automatic control owing to distorting output signals from habitual control circuits, which impede the expression of goal-directed action.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the contribution of group II spinal pathways in Parkinsonian upper limb rigidity and the modulation of spinal excitability of group I and group II pathways by L-DOPA and subthalamic nucleus-high-frequency stimulation (STN-HFS).\nThe effect of ulnar nerve electrical stimulation on Flexor Carpi Radialis Electromyogram (FCR EMG) was investigated in two groups of patients: patients receiving medication (MED group) and chronically surgically implanted patients (DBS group). Results were compared in patients ON and OFF treatment, and between patients and control subjects.\nThe resulting long-lasting facilitation in FCR EMG had similar characteristics in all groups, and surface area was assessed in analysis windows corresponding to the parts supposed to be mediated by non-monosynaptic spinal pathways to FCR motoneurones, fed by hand muscle group I and group II afferents (Louren\u00e7o et al., 2006). In both the MED and DBS groups, the group I excitation was not altered but the group II excitation was particularly enhanced when OFF treatment, compared to controls, and both L-DOPA and STN-HFS restored the group II spinal excitation to normal level.\nBoth L-DOPA and STN-HFS influence the metabolism of monoamines in the midbrain, and restore the descending neuromodulation on group II spinal reflex.\nThese results further support a group II contribution to the enhanced long latency response (LLR) to muscle stretch observed in wrist muscles of rigid Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative movement disorder that is caused, in part, by the loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta of the basal ganglia. The presence of intracellular protein aggregates, known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, within the surviving nigral neurons is the defining neuropathological feature of the disease. Accordingly, the identification of specific genes mutated in families with Parkinson's disease and of genetic susceptibility variants for idiopathic Parkinson's disease has implicated abnormalities in proteostasis, or the handling and elimination of misfolded proteins, in the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disorder. Protein folding and the refolding of misfolded proteins are regulated by a network of interactive molecules, known as the chaperone system, which is composed of molecular chaperones and co-chaperones. The chaperone system is intimately associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway which are responsible for elimination of misfolded proteins and protein quality control. In addition to their role in proteostasis, some chaperone molecules are involved in the regulation of cell death pathways. Here we review the role of the molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90, and the cochaperones Hsp40, BAG family members such as BAG5, CHIP and Hip in modulating neuronal death with a focus on dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. We also review current progress in preclinical studies aimed at targetting the chaperone system to prevent neurodegeneration. Finally, we discuss potential future chaperone-based therapeutics for the symptomatic treatment and possible disease modification of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders are devastating human diseases that include Parkinson's, Huntington's, Alzheimer's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the frontal temporal dementias. Although the clinical manifestations of these disorders have been known for quite some time, our understanding of the molecular underpinnings is only starting to emerge. Protein misfolding and aggregation is a common hallmark among these diseases, and produce a number of cellular and functional alterations. The loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra justified the use of dopaminergic therapies in patients. However, these strategies do not appear to confer disease-modifying effects, and do not prevent progression. The idea that neurotrophic factors might promote cell survival is an attractive one. Existing evidence from clinical trials is currently inconclusive, but some patients display clear clinical benefits. Thus, the current challenge is to develop novel strategies that make the use of neurotrophic factors more consistent.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the long-term progression of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients treated with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS), we retrospectively analyzed data from 50 PD patients with bilateral STN-DBS. Clinical records at baseline and at several yearly intervals were reviewed. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating scale (UPDRS) was performed preoperatively after withholding medications for at least 12 hr (OFF) and after taking the usual dose of levodopa. Postoperative evaluations were completed in four clinical states: OFF medications\u2014stimulators OFF (OFF/OFF); OFF medications\u2014stimulators ON; ON medications\u2014stimulators OFF; and ON medications\u2014stimulators ON. The UPDRS motor scores OFF/OFF were virtually unmodified up to 5 years when compared with preoperative OFF scores. There was no significant difference between OFF/OFF score variations from baseline in patients with shorter (<11 years) and longer PD duration at the time of surgery. No consistent deterioration from untreated baseline was noted for each UPDRS motor subscore (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and axial). Untreated PD motor scores did not worsen over time in patients undergoing STN-DBS, suggesting that there is no progression of motor severity. These results could be explained either by a natural stabilization of PD motor symptoms after many years or neuroprotective properties of STN-DBS.",

    "abstract": "In spite of the increasing need for brain tissue in biomedical research, overall brain banking activities in Japan has been lagging behind. On the initiative of the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, 2 projects have been carried out; the Research Resource Network (RRN) and the Parkinson's Disease Brain Bank (PDBB) donor registration program. RRN is a nation-wide network that links 15 brain repositories, and 1,463 autopsy brains have been registered in this network as of December 2009. The brain donor registration program for PDBB was established in 2006. A donor without cognitive impairment can enroll in this PDBB donor registration program. When the donor dies, the next-of-kin will contact the PDBB coordinators for subsequent autopsy services and brain retention. On obtaining the next-of-kin's consent at the time of donor's death, autopsy will be performed at PDBB collaborating hospitals of National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Juntendo University Hospital, and Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital. In order to arouse public interest, lecture meetings for citizens have been held on a regular basis. Fifty individuals have registered in the PDBB donor registration program including 27 patients with PD, 4 patient with Parkinson syndrome, 1 patient with progressive supranuclear palsy, and 18 individuals without PD or related disorders as of December 2009. Autopsies have been performed for 2 of these donors. To promote brain banking activities,it is necessary to establish legal and ethical guidelines for the use of autopsied materials in biomedical research.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a common neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by the progressive loss of dopamine neurons and the accumulation of Lewy bodies and neurites. The exact role of genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of PD has frequently been debated. The association of MPTP (methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6- tetrahydropyridine) and toxins (such as rotenone) with parkinsonism highlights the potential etiologic role of environmental toxins in disease causation. The recent discoveries of monogenic (such as \u03b1-synuclein, Parkin, UCHL1, PINK1, DJ-1, LRRK2) forms of PD have provided considerable insights into its pathophysiology. Parkin, an ubiquitin protein ligase assists in the degradation of toxic substrates via the ubiquitin proteasome system. It can also mediate a nondegradative form of ubiquitination. PINK1 and LRRK2 are possibly involved in the phosphorylation of substrates important for various cellular functions. Some toxins could interact with \u03b1-synuclein, an endogenous protein that is implicated in pathology of PD. Increasing in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that deficits in mitochondrial function, oxidative and nitrosative stress, the accumulation of aberrant or misfolded proteins, and ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunction underpin the pathogenesis of sporadic and familial forms of PD. Elucidation of the functions of the proteins encoded by the diseasecausing genes will provide an opportunity for identification of specific pathways that could be targeted in neurotherapeutics.",

The degree to which such decline impacts instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) among individuals in the early stages of PD without dementia is not well documented. The Everyday Cognitive Battery Reasoning subtest (ECB) was used to assess ability to solve everyday reasoning tasks for IADL among 19 non-demented older adults with PD in comparison to 20 older adults without PD. The two groups were similar in age, education, race and gender. Individuals with PD had significantly lower scores (M = 61.98, SD = 12.03) than the comparison group (M = 69.80, SD = 9.48). Individuals with PD, who do not have dementia, may be more likely to experience difficulties in IADL requiring reasoning including medication use, finances, and nutrition. Even more serious implications lie in the capacity to make treatment choices.",

    "abstract": "Molecular imaging studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) progression mostly focus on the first 5 years after disease onset, demonstrating rapid initial nigrostriatal neuronal loss. The fate of residual functional dopaminergic nerve terminals in patients with long-standing PD has not yet been specifically explored. Therefore, we performed [(123)I]-FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 15 patients with very long-standing PD (mean disease duration 20.6 \u00b1 6.3 years). Measurable uptake of [(123)I]-FP-CIT was still detected in the striata of all patients. As seen in early stages, reduction of tracer uptake in the putamen was more prominent than in the caudate nucleus. Asymmetry in tracer uptake between the two putamen and caudate nuclei was preserved. These findings indicate that degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD is not total even after many years of illness. Data should be considered in exploring underlying causes of progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and development of future novel dopaminergic therapeutic strategies in PD.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) accelerates reaction time (RT) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly in tasks in which decisions on the response side have to be made. This might indicate that DBS speeds up both motor and nonmotor operations. Therefore, we studied the extent to which modifications of different processing streams could explain changes of RT under subthalamic DBS. Ten PD patients on-DBS and off-DBS and 10 healthy subjects performed a choice-response task (CRT), requiring either right or left finger button presses. At the same time, EEG recordings were performed, so that RTs could be assessed together with lateralized readiness potentials (LRP), indicative of movement preparation. Additionally, an oddball task (OT) was run, in which right finger responses to target stimuli were recorded along with cognitive P300 responses. Generally, PD patients off-DBS had longer RTs than controls. Subthalamic DBS accelerated RT only in CRT. This could largely be explained by analog shortenings of LRP. No DBS-dependent changes were identified in OT, neither on the level of RT nor on the level of P300 latencies. It follows that RT accelerations under DBS of the STN are predominantly due to effects on the timing of motor instead of nonmotor processes. This starting point explains why DBS gains of response speed are low in tasks in which reactions are initiated from an advanced level of movement preparation (as in OT), and high whenever motor responses have to be raised from scratch (as in CRT).",

    "abstract": "During the pre-symptomatic stage of Parkinson's disease (PD), the idiopathic PD related abnormal synuclein immunostaining is confined to the medulla oblongata and olfactory bulb, according to Braak. In the study of the enteric nervous system of PD, it has reported that Lewy bodies were found in the Auerbach's and Meissner's plexuses. These lesions may cause dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract (GI) as pre-clinical symptoms of PD. However, because L: -dopa therapy itself may worsen the symptoms of the digestive tract function, it is needed to evaluate the gastrointestinal tract function in patients with early-stage, untreated (de novo) PD. In the present study, using the (13)C-acetate breath test ((13)C-ABT), we investigated gastric emptying in 20 untreated, early-stage PD patients and 40 treated, advanced-stage PD patients, and 20 healthy volunteers. Gastric emptying was examined by the (13)C-ABT [the half emptying time (HET), the peak time of the (13)C% dose-excess curve (T (max))]. The T (max) and HET of gastric emptying as assessed using the (13)C-ABT was significantly delayed in untreated, early-stage PD patients as compared to the controls (P < 0.001). The T (max) and HET of gastric emptying were not significantly delayed in untreated, early-stage PD patients as compared to treated, advanced-stage PD patients. The results demonstrated that delay in gastric emptying did not differ between untreated, early-stage and treated, advanced-stage PD patients. Gastric emptying of untreated, early-stage PD is already delayed. Delayed gastric emptying may be one of markers of the pre-clinical stage of PD.",
