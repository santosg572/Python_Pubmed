    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that infects all nucleate cells of vertebrates. Human infected by vertical transmission and also using raw or undercooked meat or food and water that contaminated with mature oocysts. Parkinson's disease as neurodegenerative disease affects people above 60\u00a0years. Due to high prevalence of toxoplasmosis in Iran and evidence about effects of T. gondii on neurodegenerative diseases, this study has been conducted to investigate possible correlation between Toxoplasma and Parkinson's disease in Iran. Seventy five Parkinson's patients and equal healthy volunteers were enrolled. After obtaining informed consent and sociodemographic features, 5\u00a0ml blood sample were collected and then anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM levels were examined by ELISA method. Data was analyzed with Chi-squre and Fisher's test by usig stata 11 software. Binary logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis in assessing the correlation between toxoplasmosis and Parkinson. Eighty five percent of Parkinson's group and 90.3\u00a0% of control group were positive for anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibody. In this investigation no statically differences were observed between groups and age, gender, residency and using raw or undercooked meat. There is no significant association between IgG positive titer and Parkinson's disease. However, statistically significant association was found between Parkinson and keeping cat (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) as well as the using of undercooked egg (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Although there is high level of anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibody in Parkinson's patients which reflects chronic Toxoplasma infection; we couldn't detect any statistical association between T. gondii infection and Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence demonstrates the power of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) for identifying valuable and urgently needed blood biomarkers and advancing both early and accurate detection of neurological diseases, and in particular Parkinson's disease (PD). RNA sequencing technology enables non-biased, high throughput, probe-independent inspection of expression data and high coverage and both quantification of global transcript levels as well as the detection of expressed exons and junctions given a sufficient sequencing depth (coverage). However, the analysis of sequencing data frequently presents a bottleneck. Tools for quantification of alternative splicing from sequenced libraries hardly exist at the present time, and methods that support multiple sequencing platforms are especially lacking. Here, we describe in details a whole RNA-Seq transcriptome dataset produced from PD patient's blood leukocytes. The samples were taken prior to, and following deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment while being on stimulation and following 1\u00a0h of complete electrical stimulation cessation and from healthy control volunteers. We describe in detail the methodology applied for analyzing the RNA-Seq data including differential expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). We also provide details of the corresponding analysis of in-depth splice isoform data from junction and exon reads, with the use of the software AltAnalyze. Both the RNA-Seq raw (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE42608) and analyzed data (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2805267) may be found valuable towards detection of novel blood biomarkers for PD.",

    "abstract": "(18)F-FP-CIT [(18)F-fluorinated N-3-fluoropropyl-2-beta-carboxymethoxy-3-beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane] is useful for detecting striatal dopamine transporter (DAT). Since FP-CIT shows relatively high affinities for DAT and serotonin transporter (SERT), its binding can be influenced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). We aimed to evaluate the effect of SSRIs on the binding of (18)F-FP-CIT.\nIn our (18)F-FP-CIT positron emission tomography (PET) data pool, images of 24 drug-naive Parkinson's disease (PD) patients (62.6\u2009\u00b1\u200910.6\u00a0years), 111 PD patients taking SSRIs [escitalopram (n\u2009=\u200919) and fluvoxamine (n\u2009=\u200920)] or clonazepam (n\u2009=\u200972), and 10 normal people were reviewed. PET images acquired 3\u00a0h after (18)F-FP-CIT injection were analyzed by an automated method using a predefined volume of interest (VOI) set of the striatum (ST), occipital cortex (OC), raphe nuclei (RN), and cerebellar cortex (CB). The uptake ratios (URs) of each VOI to the CB were compared among the groups.\nThe ST/CB URs of all PD groups were significantly lower than that of normal group. When adjusted for drug severity, ST/CB URs were higher in drug-naive group but had no difference among antidepressant groups. Whereas OC/CB URs were not different among groups (p\u2009>\u20090.05), RN/CB URs were significantly lower in SSRI groups than in non-SSRI groups (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and showed similar results when adjusted for disease severity.\nPD patients taking SSRIs showed significantly decreased URs in the RN but not the OC. When adjusted for Hoehn and Yar (HY) score, ST URs were not different among antidepressant groups. This result suggests that the OC may be used as a reference region for the quantification of DAT binding in (18)F-FP-CIT PET images of PD patients taking SSRIs.",

    "abstract": "In spite of the overwhelming emphasis on motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease(PD), a number of studies have revealed that the non-motor symptoms including gastrointestinal, psychiatric and sleep symptoms have a greater influence on the quality of life of many patients. This study aimed to determine the frequencies of gastrointestinal symptoms in PD patients in comparison to healthy controls and to evaluate the relationship between these GI symptoms and severity of PD.\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted over a 2-year period. Consecutive new patients of Parkinson's disease were recruited at the neurology clinics of Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH) and Murtala Muhammad specialist hospital (MMSH).Healthy age and sex matched volunteers constituted the control group. A structured, pre-tested, close-ended questionnaire inquiring about common gastrointestinal symptoms as well as demographic, and PD characteristics was administered to all cases and controls. PD severity was assessed using the Hoehn and Yahr scale (H and Y).\nA total of 80 patients and 80 controls were recruited during the study period. Their age ranged between 39 and 80 years. The mean age of the patients and controls were 61.1 \u00b1 8.5 and 61.0 \u00b1 8.4 years, respectively. The male to female ratio was 5:2. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms were constipation (48.8%), sialorrhea (18%), dysphagia (16.2%), difficulty in mastication (12.5%), and choking/aspiration (12.5%).When compared with age and sex-matched controls the differences in the occurrence of these symptoms were statistically significant.Constipation, dysphagia, difficult mastication, sialorrhea, and aspiration/choking were found to be more severe on the H and Y scale.\nSignificant features of gastrointestinal dysfunction in PD include constipation, sialorrhea, dysphagia, difficult mastication and choking. These symptoms were significantly associated with increasing severity of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "A 15-year-old asymptomatic male patient presented with an electrocardiographic abnormality and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (left ventricle ejection fraction of 40%) in a physical examination performed 2 years previously. LV dysfunction did not improve despite optimal medical therapy for dilated cardiomyopathy. Twelve-lead electrocardiography revealed a normal PR interval (138\u00a0ms) with a small delta-like wave in V2, but not a typical diagnostic wave that could be diagnosed as Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome by an electrocardiogram auto-analysis. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a remarkable asynchronous septal motion. An electrophysiological study was performed to exclude WPW syndrome. An accessory pathway (AP) was revealed on the lateral wall of the right ventricle, and radiofrequency catheter ablation was successfully performed to disconnect the AP. Thereafter, the dyssynchrony disappeared, and LV function improved. The intrinsic atrioventricular nodal conduction was very slow (A-H, 237\u00a0ms). The results of electrocardiogram auto-analysis could not be used to confirm the diagnosis of WPW syndrome because of the atypical delta wave. Conduction via the right lateral AP caused electrical dyssynchrony in the LV. This case suggests that atypical delta waves should be evaluated without depending on electrocardiographic auto-analyses in patients with LV dysfunction accompanied by dyssynchrony.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that dynamical measures such as sample entropy may be more appropriate than conventional measures when analyzing time series data such as postural sway. We evaluated conventional and dynamical measures of postural sway in Parkinson disease (PD) patients with and without freezing episodes.\nCOP (center of pressure) data were recorded during quiet standing with eyes open, eyes closed and while performing a dual task. Data for 16 patients with freezing of gait, 17 patients with no history of freezing and 24 healthy subjects were analyzed. The amount of postural sway was quantified using conventional measures, whereas for the characterization of the temporal structure of the COP data the normalized sway path and sample entropy was calculated.\nMean radius was higher and sample entropy was lower in patients with freezing symptoms as compared to healthy subjects in all three conditions. Dual-tasking significantly increased sway path length in patients with freezing, while normalized sway path did not change over conditions in this group.\nOur findings show that postural sway is characterized by a combination of large radius, short normalized sway path and high regularity of the COP only in patients with freezing. This pattern becomes most prominent in a dual-task paradigm. This may explain higher occurrence of gait freezing in dual task situations with subsequent higher risk of falls. Results suggested that dynamic measures may add valuable information for characterizing postural stability in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "An earlier age at onset of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been reported to be associated with occupational exposures to manganese and hydrocarbon solvents suggesting that exposure to neurotoxic chemicals may hasten the progression of idiopathic PD. In this study the role of occupational exposure to metals and pesticides in the progression of idiopathic PD was assessed by looking at age at disease onset. The effects of heritable genetic risk factors, which may also influence age at onset, was minimized by including only sporadic cases of PD with no family history of the disease (n=58). Independent samples Student t-test revealed that subjects with occupational exposure to metals and/or pesticides (n=36) were significantly (p=0.013) younger than unexposed controls (n=22). These subjects were then divided into three groups [high (n=18), low (n=18), and unexposed (n=22)] to ascertain if duration of exposure further influenced age at onset of PD. One-way ANOVA revealed that subjects in the high exposure group were significantly (p=0.0121) younger (mean age: 50.33 years) than unexposed subjects (mean age: 60.45 years). Subjects were also stratified by exposure type (metals vs. pesticides). These results suggest that chronic exposure to metals and pesticides is associated with a younger age at onset of PD among patients with no family history of the disease and that duration of exposure is a factor in the magnitude of this effect.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a multisystemic disorder that affects movement in its different levels of integration from the simplest motor act to the complexity of communication and social inclusion. The study of movement from the social cognitive neuroscience can contribute elements to the development of better rehabilitation treatments for Parkinson's disease patients. As a cognitive and social phenomenon, movement involves perception and action; paradoxical kinesia, as a property of motor system, is shown in this perception-action dialogue. We introduce the internal-external control hypothesis as a possible explanatory model of movement in Parkinson's disease patients. This model can explain the occurrence of paradoxical kinesia and, combined with the mirror neurons theory, accounts for the capability of people with Parkinson's disease to move like healthy controls do when there is a given sensorial space with emotional and ludic languages. Eventually, we highlight the utility of paradoxical kinesia as a rehabilitation tool for movement in people with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Ginseng is known to have antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. The present study investigated a possible role of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) in suppressing dopaminergic neuronal cell death and the cleavage of p35 to p25 in the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum (ST) using a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease mouse model.\nTen-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 30\u00a0mg/kg of MPTP at 24-h intervals for 5\u00a0d, and then administered KRG (1\u00a0mg/kg, 10\u00a0mg/kg, or 100\u00a0mg/kg) once a day for 12 consecutive days from the first injection. Pole tests were performed to assess the motor function of the mice, dopaminergic neuronal survival in the SN and ST was evaluated using tyrosine hydroxylase-immunohistochemistry, and the expressions of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), p35, and p25 in the SN and ST were measured using Western blotting.\nMPTP administration caused behavioral impairment, dopaminergic neuronal death, increased Cdk5 and p25 expression, and decreased p35 expression in the nigrostriatal system of mice, whereas KRG dose-dependently alleviated these MPTP-induced changes.\nThese results indicate that KRG can inhibit MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal death and suppress the cleavage of p35 to p25 in the SN and the ST, suggesting a possible role for KRG in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder, has been reported to be associated with brain neuroinflammation in its pathogenesis. Herein, changes in peripheral immune system were determined to better understand PD pathogenesis and provide possible target for treatment of PD through improvement of immune disorder.\n1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was intraperitoneally injected into mice to prepare PD model. Expression levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors of CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes and concentrations of the cytokines in serum were examined on day 7 after MPTP injection. Percentages of CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets were measured by flow cytometry.\nMPTP induced PD-like changes such as motor and behavioral deficits and nigrostriatal impairment. Expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-17 and IL-22, in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were upregulated and their concentrations in serum were elevated in PD progression. But, the concentrations of the anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-4, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 were not altered in the two lymphoid tissues or serum of PD mice. In addition, expression of T-box in T cells (T-bet), the specific transcription factor of helper T (Th) 1 cells, was downregulated, but expression of transcription factor forkhead box p3 (Foxp3), the transcription factor of regulatory T (Treg) cells, was upregulated. In support of the results, the numbers of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4+ cells (Th1 cells) were reduced but CD4+CD25+ cells (Treg cells) were elevated in both the lymphoid tissues of PD mice.\nPD has a dysfunction of peripheral immune system. It manifests enhancement of proinflammatory response and CD4+ T cell differentiation bias towards Treg cells away from Th1 cells.",

    "abstract": "Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome presents with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and is characterized by electrocardiographic (ECG) findings of a short PR interval and a delta wave. The objective of this study was to evaluate the electrophysiological properties of children with WPW syndrome and to develop an algorithm for the management of these patients with limited access to electrophysiological study.\nA retrospective review of all pediatric patients who underwent electrophysiological evaluation for WPW syndrome was performed.\nOne hundred nine patients underwent electrophysiological evaluation at a single tertiary center between 1997 and 2011. The median age of the patients was 11 years (0.1-18). Of the 109 patients, 82 presented with tachycardia (median age 11 (0.1-18) years), and 14 presented with syncope (median age 12 (6-16) years); 13 were asymptomatic (median age 10 (2-13) years). Induced AF degenerated to ventricular fibrillation (VF) in 2 patients. Of the 2 patients with VF, 1 was asymptomatic and the other had syncope; the accessory pathway effective refractory period was \u2264180 ms in both. An intracardiac electrophysiological study was performed in 92 patients, and ablation was not attempted for risk of atrioventricular block in 8 (8.6%). The success and recurrence rate of ablation were 90.5% and 23.8% respectively.\nThe induction of VF in 2 of 109 patients in our study suggests that the prognosis of WPW in children is not as benign as once thought. All patients with a WPW pattern on the ECG should be assessed electrophysiologically and risk-stratified. Ablation of patients with risk factors can prevent sudden death in this population.",

    "abstract": "Recent case reports suggest a possible causal correlation between antecollis and pramipexole. Here, we report the case of a 62-year-old Italian man with a 2-year history of Parkinson's disease (PD) and cervical spondylosis for which he was treated with pramipexole. He developed severe neck rigidity immediately after an inguinal hernia operation but several months after introduction of pramipexole. He was initially treated with painkillers and physiotherapy with no significant improvement. His condition deteriorated presenting disproportionate rigidity between anterior and posterior neck muscles (antecollis) to the extent that normal activities were severely restricted. However, significant improvement occurred after the withdrawal of pramipexole. The patient undertook a second cycle of physiotherapy with remarkable results and returned to function normally in everyday life. This case report suggests that neurologists should be motivated to inform the scientific community about other possible cases in which an association between antecollis and pramipexole might operate in PD.",

    "abstract": "Several evidences in animal models have consistently an alteration of cortico-striatal plasticity, which is related to the degeneration of the substantia nigra. An alteration of plasticity have also been reported in humans by recording evoked field potentials in the substantia nigra pars reticulata of PD patients undergoing subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation where high-frequency (HF) in the OFF state did not induce a lasting change in field potential amplitude in the substantia nigra. In addition protocols of non-invasive brain stimulation, such as paired associative stimulation (PAS) and theta-burst stimulation (TBS), can be used to investigate cortical plasticity of the human primary motor cortex. Despite data reported in literature are apparently controversial with some studies showing a reduced or increased or even normal LTP and LTD like plasticity, recent evidences suggest the hypothesis that these different pat- terns of cortical plasticity likely depend on the stage of the disease and on the concomitant administration of L-DOPA. The current review will provide an up-to-date of these issues on cortical plasticity in PD discussing the clinical implications in rehabilitation. In addition in the last section we will review the state of art of non invasive neuro- modulation as adjuvant treatment in the advanced stage of the disease.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, several lines of evidence have been presented that document the clinical manifestations, genetic associations, and sub-cellular mechanisms of the inter-relatedness of \u03b2-glucocerebrosidase mutations and the emergence of Parkinson disease among carriers and patients with Gaucher disease. This review is an attempt to apprise the reader of the recent literature with the caveat that this is an area of intensive exploration that is constantly being updated because of the immediate clinical ramifications but also because of the impact on our understanding of Parkinson disease, and finally because of the unexpected inter-reactions between these entities on the molecular level. It has been an unexpected happenstance that it has been discovered that a rare monogenetic disease has an interface at many points with a neurological disorder of the elderly that has both familial and sporadic forms: to date there is no cure for either of these disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive, neurodegenerative brain disease that is promoted by mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, protein aggregation and proteasome dysfunction in the brain. Compared with computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), non-invasive nuclear radiopharmaceuticals have great significance for the early diagnosis of PD due to their high sensitivity and specificity in atypical and preclinical cases. Based on the development of coordination chemistry and chelator design, radionuclides may be delivered to lesions by attaching to PD-related transporters and receptors, such as dopamine, serotonin, and others. In this review, we comprehensively detailed the current achievements in radionuclide imaging in Parkinson's disease.",

Using standardized rating scales, the authors tested the hypothesis that anxiety, depression, and apathy vary in the ON versus OFF states in PD in 33 PD patients and 29 healthy age- and education-matched controls. PD patients had significantly higher anxiety, depression, and apathy scores than control participants, regardless of ON-OFF state. Anxiety scores were higher in PD patients on relative to off dopaminergic medication. The ON-OFF difference in anxiety related to degree of improvement in motor function but not illness duration.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects muscle tone, strength, flexibility, motor control, psychological outlook, cognition, and function. Exercise has been found to improve physical ability and psychological outlook, but the effect of yoga on individuals with PD has not been well researched. The purposes of this study were to identify outcome measures that were responsive to change in individuals with PD after an 8-week adaptive yoga program and to determine appropriate sample sizes for future studies. In a repeated measures design, 10 participants with a Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2 or 3 were tested prior to and after an 8-week control phase and again after they underwent an 8-week adaptive yoga program. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests revealed differences in time of measure that approached significance for the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (p = 0.008) and the 30-Second Chair Stand (TSCS) (p = 0.013). The interaction between time of measure and gender approached significance for the Sit-and-Reach Test (SRT) (p = 0.08 and 0.03, right and left respectively), with male participants improving in sit-and-reach flexibility compared with female participants after intervention. The interaction between time of measure and age approached significance for the Single-Leg Balance test (SLB) (p = 0.007), with younger participants improving in SLB time after intervention. Power calculations found that a sample size ranging from 33 to 153 would be required to achieve significance at the 0.01 level in the various outcome measures in a future study of this design. The depression subscale of the HADS, the TSCS, the SLB, and the right and left SRT were the measures that changed following the yoga intervention and are recommended as outcome measures in future studies investigating the effectiveness of yoga for individuals with PD. This preliminary study supports further investigation of adaptive yoga using a randomized design and a larger sample size of individuals with PD.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) have generated inconsistent results. The purpose of this population-based longitudinal follow-up study was to investigate whether incident PD is associated with an increased risk of AMI.\nA total of 3,211 subjects with at least 2 ambulatory visits with the principal diagnosis of PD in 2001 were enrolled in the PD group. The non-PD group consisted of 3,211 propensity score-matched subjects without PD. The propensity scores were computed using a logistic regression model that included age, sex, preexisting comorbidities, and socioeconomic status. The 3-year AMI-free survival rates of the 2 groups were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Stratified Cox proportional hazard regression with patients matched by propensity score was used to estimate the effect of PD on subsequent occurrence of AMI.\nDuring the 3-year follow-up period, 83 subjects in the PD group and 53 in the non-PD group developed AMI (either fatal or nonfatal) events. The hazard ratio of AMI for the PD group compared with the non-PD group was 1.67 (95% CI 1.15-2.41, P = .0067). The AMI-free survival rate of the PD group was significantly lower than that of the non-PD group (P = .0032). The hazard ratios associated with PD for the combined end point 1 (AMI or cardiovascular death) and combined end point 2 (AMI or all-cause death) were 1.46 (95% CI 1.14-1.88, P = .0029) and 1.42 (95% CI 1.24-1.64, P < .0001), respectively.\nThis study shows that PD is related to an increased risk of AMI. Further studies are required to investigate the mechanism underlying this association.",

    "abstract": "the median nerve at the wrist in subjects during two motor imagery conditions: holding and not holding the sensor of a pinch meter between the thumb and index finger. Our aim was to determine whether mental simulation without the muscle contraction associated with motion can increase the excitability of spinal neural function in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). F-waves of the left thenar muscles were examined in 10 patients with PD under resting, holding and motor imagery conditions. For the holding condition, the subjects held the sensor of the pinch meter between their thumb and index finger. For the motor imagery conditions, the subjects were asked to imagine a 50% maximal voluntary isometric contraction holding and not holding the sensor of the pinch meter between their thumb and index finger (motor imagery \"with\"/\"without sensor\"). Persistence during motor imagery under the \"with sensor\" condition increased significantly compared with persistence during resting (n=10, z=2.2509, p=0.0244, Wilcoxon test). The F/M amplitude ratio during motor imagery under the \"with sensor\" condition increased significantly compared with that during resting (n=10, z=2.1915, p=0.0284, Wilcoxon test). Excitability of spinal neural function during motor imagery in Parkinson's disease Motor imagery under the \"with the sensor\" condition increased excitability of the spinal neural output to the thenar muscles. Because excitability of the spinal neural output to the thenar muscles during motor imagery \"with the sensor\" was significantly higher than that during resting, we suggest that movement preparation for a motor imagery task is important in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of neurons in specific regions of the nervous system, notably in the substantia nigra pars compacta and, in most cases, by the deposition of intraneuronal inclusions named Lewy bodies. These pathological alterations have profound effects on the brain function, leading to the progressive development of various symptoms, the most prominent being the impaired initiation of voluntary movements caused by the loss of dopamine signaling in the basal ganglia. Here, we provide an overview of the mouse models of Parkinson's disease, with the goal of guiding selection of the most appropriate model for studying the question at hand. Pharmacological approaches targeting dopamine signaling and toxins leading to selective degeneration of nigral neurons are used to validate symptomatic treatments that aim at restoring effective dopaminergic function for motor control. Alternative mouse models are based on genetic modifications that are meant to reproduce the inherited alterations associated with familial forms of Parkinson's disease. Although genetic models have most often failed to induce overt degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons, they provide essential tools to explore the multifactorial etiology of this complex neurodegenerative disorder.",

    "abstract": "In the advanced Parkison's disease (PD) the late complications of levodopa therapy have to be considered: motor and/or non-motor fluctuations with or without disturbing dyskinesias. The non-motor fluctuations often influence the quality of life (QoL) in a much more negative way compared with the motor symptoms. In the treatment of advanced PD there are several device-aided methods - deep brain stimulation, apomorphine pump, levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) - to improve the symptoms, the QoL, sometimes even in an individual, tailored custom form. The LCIG therapy was introduced in Hungary in 2011. Here we summarize the data of our patients: we have tested almost 60 patients and in 43 cases we have started this treatment. We analyze the duration of illness, levodopa therapy, motor and non-motor fluctuation of patients and present our experiences with the test phase and the chronic LCIG therapy via PEG/PEJ implantation. We paid attention to the surgery and device - depending side effects. Our experiences are similar to the international data. In patients selection ,,the right treatment, to the right patient, in the right time\" is of importance.",

    "abstract": "Hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra (SN) measured by transcranial sonography (TCS) is a characteristic feature observed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). To our knowledge, no SN hyperechogenicity data are available for Polish population. Moreover most of studies come from few centres, which used the one type of ultrasound device. The main aim of the study was to investigate the association between PD and SN hyperechogenicity measured by sonographic machine, not assessed so far.\nIn this study cross-sectional study SN hyperechogenicity was evaluated in 102 PD patients and 95 control subjects. Midbrain was visualised by Aloka Prosound 7 ultrasound device. SN area measurement, the relation to the clinical features of PD, inter- and intra-observer reliability were evaluated.\nWe confirmed that SN echogenicity is significantly increased in PD patients compared to control subjects (p < 0.001). The area under curve for PD patients vs. controls was 0.93. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated a cut-offs for SN echogenicity at 0.19 cm\u00b2 with accuracy equal to 90%, specificity - 86% and sensitivity - 93.7%. The SN hyperechogenicity was not related to PD clinical findings. Reliability was good if an experienced sonographer performed the SN measurements.\nThis study shows that the SN abnormality observed by TCS isa specific feature, which can be helpful in the process of PD diagnosing.",

    "abstract": "A preferential dysfunction/loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) accounts for the main motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common degenerative movement disorder. However, the neuronal loss is not stochastic, but rather displays regionally selectivity, indicating the existence of different DA subpopulations in the SNpc. To identify the underlying molecular determinants is thereby instrumental in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of PD-related neuron dysfunction/loss and offering new therapeutic targets. Recently, we have demonstrated that aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1A1) is one such molecular determinant that defines and protects an SNpc DA neuron subpopulation preferentially affected in PD. In this review, we provide further analysis and discussion on the roles of ALDH1A1 in the function and survival of SNpc DA neurons in both rodent and human brains. We also explore the feasibility of ALDH1A1 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for PD.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) that occurred during video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lobectomy in a patient with concealed Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. A 59-year-old man with lung cancer was scheduled for VATS lobectomy under general anesthesia. After inserting a thoracic epidural catheter, general anesthesia was induced with intravenous administration of propofol. Anesthesia was maintained with inhalation of desfurane in an air/oxygen mixture and intravenous infusion of remifentanil. Recurrent PSVT occurred three times, and the last episode of PSVT continued for 50 minutes regardless of administration of antiarrhythmic drugs. Synchronized electric shock via adhesive electrode pads on the patient's chest successfully converted PSVT back to normal sinus rhythm. The remaining course and postoperative period were uneventful. An electrophysiological study performed after hospital discharge detected concealed WPW syndrome, which had contributed to the development of atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia. Concealed WPW syndrome is a rare, but critical complication that could possibly cause lethal atrial tachyarrhythmias during the perioperative period. In the present case, cardioversion using adhesive electrode pads briefly terminated PSVT in a patient with concealed WPW syndrome.",

He had a stooped posture and a shuffling gait. He was not able to ambulate comfortably without the guidance of his walker. The patient had a resting tremor, most notably in his right hand. Outcome measures were documented using the Parkinson's Disease Questionaire-39 (PDQ-39) and patient subjective reports.\nThe patient was treated with blue-lensed glasses, vibration stimulation therapy, spinal manipulation, and eye-movement exercises. Within the first week of treatment, there was a reduction in symptoms, improvement in ambulation, and tremor.\nFor this particular patient, the use of alternative treatment procedures appeared to help his Parkinson disease signs and symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Recent research on pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases has revealed that neuroinflammation derived from glial activation enhances the progression of devastating diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). Although whether or not PD-onset is triggered by neuroinflammatory mechanisms remains unclear, various experimental evidences mainly using cellular and mice models have suggested that cytokines like IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1 and IL-6, and secreted \u03b1-synuclein from the neurons activate the microglias, resulting in the disease exacerbation. Also, levels of serum/plasma cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, IL-2 and ApoA1 have been reported to be significantly elevated in patients with PD compared to the controls. In this summary, I will report the present status of PD pathogenesis associated with neuroinflammation based on the latest reports associated with PD molecular mechanism focusing on the neuroinflammation.",

However, recently, the clinical significance of SRBD and its impact on sleepiness and disease severity have been debated.

These symptoms originate from motor symptoms, nocturnal problems, psychiatric symptoms, and other sleep disorders including Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), Restless legs syndrome (RLS), and Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS). Especially, RBD is paid attention to prodromal symptoms of PD. Also, one third of patients with PD have RBD symptoms. Moreover, RBD is one of aggravating factors of motor symptoms, autonomic dysfunctions, and dementia. Now, the evidence based medicine for sleep disturbances is lack in patients with PD.

    "abstract": "Chronic levodopa (L-dopa) treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD) is often associated with the development of motor complications, but the corresponding epidemiological data is rare in Chinese PD patients. The present survey was to investigate the prevalence rate of wearing-off (WO) and dyskinesia among the patients with PD in China.\nFrom May 2012 to October 2012, a 3-step registry survey for wearing off (WO) and dyskinesia patients with PD receiving levodopa therapy was performed simultaneously at 28 movement disorders clinics in China.\nThere were 1,558 PD patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Among them, 1,051 had at least one positive response of 9-item wearing off questionnaire (WOQ-9), 724 and 160 patients were finally diagnosed with WO and dyskinesia by movement disorders specialists, respectively. The overall prevalence rates of WO and dyskinesia were 46.5% (95% CI 44.0% - 48.9%) and 10.3% (95% CI 8.8% - 11.8%), respectively. The mean score of WOQ-9 for those with WO was 3.8 (SD\u2009=\u20091.8), with movement slowness being the most common motor symptoms and pain/aching being the most common non-motor symptoms. Better improvement of motor symptoms (n\u2009=\u2009354, 87.8%) and long-term disease control and drug selection (n\u2009=\u2009288, 71.5%) were the two most frequently considered factors when movement disorders specialists adjusted therapeutic strategies for patients with WO.\nThis survey provided the first multi-center epidemiological data of motor complications among PD patients on L-dopa therapy from mainland China. WO prevalence rate among Chinese PD patients was in line with, while dyskinesia prevalence rate was lower than previous reports from other Countries.",

    "abstract": "Exaggerated beta range (15-30 Hz) oscillatory activity is observed in the basal ganglia of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients during implantation of deep brain stimulation electrodes. This activity has been hypothesized to contribute to motor dysfunction in PD patients. However, it remains unclear how these oscillations develop and how motor circuits become entrained into a state of increased synchronization in this frequency range after loss of dopamine. It is also unclear whether this increase in neuronal synchronization actually plays a significant role in inducing the motor symptoms of this disorder. The hemiparkinsonian rat has emerged as a useful model for investigating relationships between loss of dopamine, increases in oscillatory activity in motor circuits and behavioral state. Chronic recordings from these animals show exaggerated activity in the high beta/low gamma range (30-35 Hz) in the dopamine cell-lesioned hemisphere. This activity is not evident when the animals are in an inattentive rest state, but it can be stably induced and monitored in the motor cortex and basal ganglia when they are engaged in an on-going activity such as treadmill walking. This review discusses data obtained from this animal model and the implications and limitations of this data for obtaining further insight into the significance of beta range activity in PD.",

    "abstract": "To discuss the pharmacology, mechanism of action, and chemical properties of the cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) rivastigmine; to provide a rationale for transdermal delivery and supportive clinical data, along with practical guidance on rivastigmine patch use in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia.\nPivotal studies of rivastigmine capsules and patch were identified using PubMed and the rivastigmine US prescribing information. PubMed searches were performed in 2013 using rivastigmine as a keyword.\nEnglish-language articles related to rivastigmine considered of relevance to primary care physicians were included.\nPharmacologic differences exist between rivastigmine and ChEIs. Clinical studies demonstrate symptomatic efficacy of oral rivastigmine across all stages of Alzheimer's disease and mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease dementia. However, gastrointestinal adverse events limit access to optimal therapeutic doses. Strategies that lower maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and prolong time to Cmax, ie, transdermal delivery, may improve tolerability. Clinical registration studies have demonstrated improved tolerability of rivastigmine 9.5-mg/24-h patch versus 6-mg twice-daily capsules in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, and a positive benefit-risk profile of 13.3-mg/24-h versus 9.5-mg/24-h patch in patients needing enhanced efficacy. Clinical data comparing 13.3-mg/24-h versus 4.6-mg/24-h patch in severe Alzheimer's disease demonstrated efficacy on cognition and activities of daily living. These data led to approval of rivastigmine patch in severe Alzheimer's disease. Transdermal delivery also has practical advantages, including simple, once-daily administration and a visual indicator of compliance. Potential application site reactions can be minimized and need not be a barrier to treatment.\nIn addition to practical advantages, rivastigmine patch may improve clinical outcomes throughout the course of Alzheimer's disease by providing access to high-dose efficacy without compromising tolerability.",

    "abstract": "Although many surgical procedures originally associated with gastroparesis are less commonly performed nowadays, several more recently developed upper abdominal procedures may be complicated by the development of gastroparesis. Gastroparesis has been described in association with neurologic disorders ranging from Parkinson disease to muscular dystrophy, and its presence may have important implications for patient management and prognosis. Although scleroderma is most frequently linked with gastrointestinal motility disorder, gastroparesis has been linked to several other connective tissue disorders. The management of these patients presents several challenges, and is best conducted in the context of a dedicated and skilled multidisciplinary team.",

    "abstract": "A group of mice with preliminary implanted (under general anesthesia) electrodes for cortical EEG and nuchal EMG was subjected to continuous baseline 24-hr video and digital polysomnographic recording with the 12/12 light/dark schedule, and then injected subcutaneously with 24 or 48 mg/kg of MPTP toxin or (the control group) saline. The recordings were continued for 2 weeks more. A significant increase in activity and the waking percentage as well as decrease in REM sleep and NREM sleep (tendency) during the dark period as compared to the baseline and control recordings was found. The effect was seen just on the 7th day following MPTP administration and became significant by the 14th day. The effect was more pronounced after 48 mg/kg injection than after 24. There were no changes during the light period. Morphological control revealed a 70% and 35% decreases in the amount of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons in substancia nigra/pars compacta after 48 and 24 mg/kg of MPTP, respectively, as compared to the saline group.",

    "abstract": "The correlation between Parkinson disease and malnutrition is well established, however a protein-restricted diet is usually prescribed because of potentially negative interactions between dietary amino acids and l-dopa pharmacokinetics. This strategy could increase the risk of further nutritional deficits.\nA monocentric, prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study was performed on two groups of Parkinson-affected, protein-restricted, patients: Intervention (n = 7; amino acid supplementation twice daily) and Placebo (n = 7; placebo supplementation twice daily). At enrolment, after 3- and 6-month supplementation, neurological evaluations (UPDRS III, Hoenh-Yahr scale, l-dopa equivalent dose assessment) were performed and blood sample was collected to define insulin sensitivity (QUICKI index) and oxidative stress (oxidized and reduced glutathione). Repeated measure ANCOVA was applied to define time effect and time \u00d7 treatment interaction.\nParticipants were comparable at baseline for all assessed parameters. Neurological outcomes and l-dopa requirement were comparable in both group after 6-month of supplementation, without time \u00d7 treatment interaction. The decrease in insulin sensitivity, as assessed by QUICKI index, observed after 6 months in both groups, was greater in Placebo than in Intervention (time effect p < 0.001; time \u00d7 treatment interaction p = 0.01). Moreover, despite no changes in total erythrocyte glutathione concentrations, oxidized glutathione levels decreased by 28 \u00b1 17% in the Intervention while increased by 55 \u00b1 38% in Placebo (time effect p = 0.05; time \u00d7 treatment interaction p = 0.05), after 6-month supplementation.\nAmino acid supplementation, assumed with shrewd temporal distribution, did not show detrimental effects on neurological and pharmacological control in protein-restricted Parkinson-affected patients, chronically treated with l-dopa. Furthermore, daily amino acid supplementation partially counteracted insulin resistance development and the loss in antioxidant availability.",

Thus, a systematic meta-analysis of observational studies was performed to clarify this topic.\nThe databases of PubMed and EMBASE were searched for case-control or cohort studies published up till June 2, 2014. Meta-analysis of the relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was estimated using random-effects models.\nA final total of ten case-control and four cohort studies were included in our meta-analysis. The overall combined RR of PD for ever users versus never users of HRT was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.84-1.20). Limited to those subjects who only use estrogen, a similar trend was detected (RR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.69-1.30). In the subgroup analysis by study design, no significant association was observed in case-control studies (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.62-1.02), whereas a positive association was found in cohort studies (RR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10-1.40). In further analysis according to study quality, an inverse association was found in the low-quality group (RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.40-0.82), whereas a positive association was found in the high-quality group (RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.02-1.31).\nIn summary, our results of meta-analysis do not support a protective role of HRT in female PD development.",

In the subgroup analysis by study design, no significant association was observed in case-control studies (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.62-1.02), whereas a positive association was found in cohort studies (RR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10-1.40).

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally regarded as a neurodegenerative movement disorder, however, nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration is also thought to disrupt non-motor loops connecting basal ganglia to areas in frontal cortex involved in cognition and emotion processing. PD patients are impaired on tests of emotion recognition, but it is difficult to disentangle this deficit from the more general cognitive dysfunction that frequently accompanies disease progression. Testing for emotion recognition deficits early in the disease course, prior to cognitive decline, better assesses the sensitivity of these non-motor corticobasal ganglia-thalamocortical loops involved in emotion processing to early degenerative change in basal ganglia circuits. In addition, contrasting this with a group of healthy aging individuals demonstrates changes in emotion processing specific to the degeneration of basal ganglia circuitry in PD. Early PD patients (EPD) were recruited from a randomized clinical trial testing the safety and tolerability of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) in early-staged PD. EPD patients were previously randomized to receive optimal drug therapy only (ODT), or drug therapy plus STN-DBS (ODT + DBS). Matched healthy elderly controls (HEC) and young controls (HYC) also participated in this study. Participants completed two control tasks and three emotion recognition tests that varied in stimulus domain. EPD patients were impaired on all emotion recognition tasks compared to HEC. Neither therapy type (ODT or ODT + DBS) nor therapy state (ON/OFF) altered emotion recognition performance in this study. Finally, HEC were impaired on vocal emotion recognition relative to HYC, suggesting a decline related to healthy aging. This study supports the existence of impaired emotion recognition early in the PD course, implicating an early disruption of fronto-striatal loops mediating emotional function.",

Identification of these symptoms by the patient as well as by the physician is determinant in order to achieve an early diagnosis.\nTo determine the time from motor symptoms onset to the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and analyze the clinical and demographic factors related to it.\nA cross-sectional study was carried out including subjects with Parkinson's disease seen during the 2011-2012 period and belonging to the Mexican National Parkinson's Registry. Time from symptom onset to the diagnosis was collected; its relation with demographic and clinical characteristics was assessed.\nA total of 1,062 subjects were included. Delay in diagnosis was 29.5 months. Predictive factors for a longer diagnostic delay were symptoms onset before 40 years of age (B: -0.350; p < 0.001) and a positive family history of Parkinson's disease (B: 0.224; p < 0.001).\nThe diagnosis of Parkinson\u00b4s disease in Mexico is two and a half times greater than what has been reported for other countries.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), which has been reported not to be restricted to striatal neurons. However, studies that analyzed mitochondrial function at the level of selected enzymatic activities in peripheral tissues have produced conflicting data. We considered the electron transport chain as a complex system with mitochondrial membrane potential as an integrative indicator for mitochondrial fitness.\nTwenty-five IPD patients (nine females; mean disease duration, 6.2\u00a0years) and 16 healthy age-matched controls (12 females) were recruited. Live platelets were purified using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and single-cell data on mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8) were measured by cytometry and challenged with a protonophore agent.\nFunctional mitochondrial membrane potential was detected in all participants. The challenge test reduced the membrane potential in all IPD patients and controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). However, the response to the challenge was not significantly different between patients and controls.\nWhile the reported protonophore challenge assay is a valid marker of overall mitochondrial function in live platelets, intact mitochondrial membrane potential in platelets derived from IPD patients suggests that presumed mitochondrial enzymatic deficiencies are compensable in this cell type. In consequence, mitochondrial membrane potential in platelets cannot be used as a diagnostic biomarker for nonstratified IPD but should be further explored in potential Parkinson's disease subtypes and tissues with higher energy demands.",

    "abstract": "Deficits in executive functions occur in up to 93% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Apathy, a reduction of motivation and goal-directed behavior is an important part of the syndrome; affecting both the patients as well as their social environment. Executive functions can be subdivided into three different processes: initiation, shifting and inhibition. We examined the hypotheses, (1) that apathy in patients with Parkinson's disease is only related to initiation and not to shifting and inhibition, and (2) that depression and severity of motor signs correlate with apathy. Fifty-one non-demented patients (19 = female) with PD were evaluated for apathy, depression and executive functions. Executive function variables were summarized with an index variable according to the defined executive processes. Linear regression with stepwise elimination procedure was used to select significant predictors. The significant model (R (2) = 0.41; p < 0.01) revealed influences of initiation (b = -0.79; p < 0.01), gender (b = -7.75; p < 0.01), age (b = -0.07; p < 0.05) and an age by gender interaction (b = 0.12; p < 0.01) on apathy in Parkinson's disease. Motor signs, depression and level of education did not influence the relation. These results support an association of apathy and deficits of executive function in PD. Initiation strongly correlates with apathy, whereas depression does not. We conclude, that initiation dysfunction in a patient with Parkinson's disease heralds apathy. Apathy and depression can be dissociated. Additionally, apathy is influenced by age and gender: older age correlates with apathy in men, whereas in women it seems to protect against it.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory performance in Parkinson's disease (PD) is closely associated with subsequent cognitive decline. In the present study, we analyzed the olfaction-dependent functional connectivity with a hypothesis that olfactory performance would influence functional connectivity within key brain areas of PD. A total of 110 nondemented drug-na\u00efve patients with PD were subdivided into three groups of high score (PD-H, n\u2009=\u200923), middle score (PD-M, n\u2009=\u200964), and low score (PD-L, n\u2009=\u200923) based on olfactory performance. We performed the resting-state functional connectivity with seed region of interest in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and caudate. An analysis of functional connectivity revealed that PD-L patients exhibited a significant attenuation of cortical functional connectivity with the PCC in the bilateral primary sensory areas, right frontal areas, and right parietal areas compared to PD-H or PD-M patients. Meanwhile, PD-L patients exhibited a significant enhancement of striatocortical functional connectivity in the bilateral occipital areas and right frontal areas compared to PD-H or PD-M patients. In the voxel-wise correlation analysis, olfactory performance was positively associated with cortical functional connectivity with the PCC in similar areas of attenuated cortical connectivity in PD-L patients relative to PD-H patients. On the other hand, the cortical functional connectivity with the caudate was negatively correlated with olfactory performance in similar areas of increased connectivity in PD-L patients relative to PD-H patients. The present study demonstrated that resting state functional connectivity exhibits a distinctive pattern depending on olfactory performance, which might shed light on a meaningful relationship between olfactory impairment and cognitive dysfunction in PD.",

    "abstract": "To observe the effect of electroacupuncture(EA) on phosphalized extracellular regulated protein kinases(p-ERK) 1/2 signaling pathway and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 protein levels in the substantia nigra (SN) in rats with Parkinson's disease (PD), so as to explore its mechanism underlying improvement of PD.\n32 male SD rats were randomly and averagely divided into normal control group, sham-operation group, model group and EA group. PD model was established by intra-dermal-injection of rotenone(1 mg/kg, dissolved in DMSO and saline, concentration: 0. 25 mg/mL) at the nape, once daily for 14 days. EA (2 Hz, 2 mA) was applied to \"Fengfu\"(GV 16)and \"Taichong\"(LR 3) for 20 min, once daily for 14 days. For sham-operation group, subcutaneous injection of the same dose of DMSO and saline was given in the same way. The expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), p-ERK 1/2, inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1P proteins of the SN tissue were detected using Western blot. The rat's horizontal and vertical movement ability was assessed using open-field tests.\nThe horizontal and vertical movement scores were significantly lower in the model group than in the normal control group, and markedly higher in the EA group than in the model group (P<0. 05). Compared with the normal control group, the expression level of TH protein in the SN was significantly reduced in the model group( P<0. 05 ),while the expression levels of p-ERK 1/2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 proteins were significantly increased in the model group(P<0. 05). After EA intervention, the expression level of TH protein was significantly increased(P<0.05),and those of p-ERK 1/2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 proteins were significantly down-regulated(P<0. 05) in the EA group compared to the model group.\nEA therapy may improve PD rats' movement ability, which may be associated with its effects in down-regulating the expression levels of p-ERK 1/2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 proteins and up-regulating the expression of TH protein in the SN.",

    "abstract": "Late stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia which inevitably emerge during the disease due to long-term use of levodopa and hinder treatment. The use of intestinal levodopa/carbidopa gel stabilizes the drug blood concentration and reduces the severity of motor parkinsonian symptoms. The literature of the last two decades on the efficacy and safety of intrarenal introduction of intestinal levodopa/carbidopa gel in PD patients is reviewed.A data analysis of intestinal levodopa/carbidopa gel revealed the efficacy of this method in the late stages of PD. The drug reduced motor symptoms, severity of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia and improved quality of life. Some studies demonstrated the decrease in PD stage, as evaluated by Hoehn and Yahr, during treatment with intestinal levodopa/carbidopa gel. The good tolerability profile allows for possibility of using this method for multiyear treatment. Side-effects were mostly related to drug delivery. All of them may be overcome in future in the process of technical improvement.",

    "abstract": "A woman started to feel intractable pain on her lower legs when she was 76. At the age of 78, she was diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease (PD). The leg pain was suspected to be a symptom of PD after eliminating other causes. The patient also suffered from nonmotor symptoms, depression, anxiety, hot flashes, and paroxysmal sweating. Though the patient had received pharmacotherapy including levodopa for 5 years, she still suffered from the nonmotor symptoms and was referred to our department. We treated her with acupuncture based on the Chinese traditional medicine and electroacupuncture five times per week. After the 2-week treatment, the assessment for the symptoms was as follows; visual analogue scale (VAS) score of the leg pain was 16\u2009mm (70\u2009mm, before), Hamilton's rating scales for depression (HAM-D) score was 9 (18, before), timed 3\u2009m Up and Go took 20 steps in 30\u2009sec (24 steps in 38\u2009sec, before), and the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part 1 score was 13 (21, before). Autonomic symptoms, hot flashes and paroxysmal sweating, were also alleviated. Acupuncture may be a good treatment modality for nonmotor symptoms in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system and is characterized by motor system disorders resulting in loss of dopamine producing brain cells. Acidic fibroblast growth factor, also called FGF1, promotes the survival of neurons. The aims of the present study were to confirm FGF1 could protect neurons cultures from 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) toxicity in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated FGF1 administration improved the motor function recovery, increased the TH-positive neurons survival and up-regulated the levels of neurotransmitters in PD rats. Meanwhile, FGF1 prevents the death of DA neuron at least in part by reducing the levels of \u03b1-synuclein and ER stress. The administration of FGF1 activated downstream signals PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2. In conclusion, FGF1 diminished \u03b1-synuclein neurotoxicity by down regulating ER stress mediators and the level of apoptosis, and these effects may underlying the activation of the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signal pathway.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate predictors of the response to doxazosin, a selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, when used for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with Parkinson's disease.\nIn a prospective study, 33 consecutive men (mean age 59.2 \u00b1 7.0 years) with Parkinson's disease and lower urinary tract symptoms were evaluated. Neurological dysfunction was assessed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Urological assessment was performed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment with 4 mg/day of extended-release doxazosin, including symptom evaluation with the International Continence Society male short-form questionnaire, an assessment of the impact of lower urinary tract symptoms on quality of life and urodynamics. Clinical and urodynamic predictors of response were specifically evaluated.\nCompared with the score at baseline, the total International Continence Society male short-form score was reduced after doxazosin administration, from 17.4 \u00b1 7.5 to 11.1 \u00b1 6.9 (p<0.001). The impact of lower urinary tract symptoms on quality of life was also significantly reduced, from 1.8 \u00b1 1.1 to 1.0 \u00b1 1.0 (p<0.001) and the maximum urinary flow varied from 9.3 \u00b1 4.4 to 11.2 \u00b1 4.6 ml/s (p=0.025). The severity of neurological impairment was the only predictor of the clinical response. Additionally, patients with a Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score lower than 70 had a significantly higher chance of clinical improvement with doxazosin treatment than those with higher Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores did (RR=3.10, 95% CI=[1.15 to 5.37], p=0.011).\nDoxazosin resulted in the improvement of lower urinary tract symptoms and the maximum flow rate and was well tolerated in men with Parkinson's disease. The response to treatment is dependent on the severity of neurological disability.",

    "abstract": "Visual hallucinations (VHs) are a very personal experience, and it is not clear whether information about them is best provided by informants or patients. Some patients may not share their hallucinatory experiences with caregivers to avoid distress or for fear of being labeled insane, and others do not have informants at all, which limits the use of informant-based questionnaires. The aim of this study was to compare patient and caregiver views about VHs in Parkinson disease (PD), using the North-East Visual Hallucinations Interview (NEVHI).\nFifty-nine PD patient-informant pairs were included. PD patients and informants were interviewed separately about VHs using the NEVHI. Informants were additionally interviewed using the four-item version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Inter-reliability and concurrent validity of the different measures were compared.\nVHs were more commonly reported by patients than informants. The inter-rater agreement between NEVHI-patient and NEVHI-informant was moderate for complex VHs (Cohen's kappa\u00a0= 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.75; t\u00a0= 3.43, df\u00a0= 58, p\u00a0= 0.001) and feeling of presence (Cohen's kappa\u00a0= 0.35; 95% CI: 0.00-0.70; t\u00a0= 2.75, df\u00a0= 58, p\u00a0= 0.006), but agreement was poor for illusions (Cohen's kappa\u00a0= 0.25; 95% CI:\u00a0-0.07-0.57; t\u00a0= 2.36, df\u00a0= 58, p\u00a0= 0.018) and passage hallucinations (Cohen's kappa\u00a0= 0.16; 95% CI:\u00a0-0.04-0.36; t\u00a0= 2.26, df\u00a0= 58, p\u00a0= 0.024).\nWhen assessing VHs in PD patients, it is best to rely on patient information, because not all patients share the details of their hallucinations with their caregivers.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive decline is a burdensome extra-motor symptom associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed at investigating intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of the brain in cognitively unimpaired (PD-CU) and impaired PD patients (PD-CI) compared with age-matched healthy controls. \"Resting-state\" functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired in 53 subjects, that is, 14 PD-CU patients, 17 PD-CI patients, and 22 control subjects. Cognition and cognitive status for patient classification were assessed using detailed neuropsychological testing. In PD-CU patients versus controls, we demonstrated significantly increased iFC (hyperconnectivity) presenting as network expansions in cortical, limbic, and basal ganglia-thalamic areas. Significantly, decreased iFC in PD-CI patients compared with control subjects was observed, predominantly between major nodes of the default mode network. In conclusion, the increased iFC might be the initial manifestation of altered brain function preceding cognitive deficits. Hyperconnectivity could be an adaptive (compensatory) mechanism by recruiting additional resources to maintain normal cognitive performance. As PD-related pathology progresses, functional disruptions within the default mode networks seem to be considerably associated with cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "To explore the variations of subpopulation of peripheral lymphocytes in Parkinson's disease (PD) and locate its potential biomarkers for clinical evaluations.\nThe methods of direct immunostaining and flow cytometry were employed to test the percentages of CD3(+), CD3(+)CD4(+), CD3(+)CD8(+), CD19(+) lymphocytes in blood samples of 77 PD patients and 82 healthy controls. And the percentages of CD3(+)CD4(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+) lymphocytes and the parameters of patients and health controls were analyzed.\nCompared to controls, the percentages of CD3(+), CD3(+)CD4(+) lymphocytes significantly decreased in PD patients ((62 \u00b1 12)% vs (66 \u00b1 9) %, P = 0.04; (35 \u00b1 9) % vs (38 \u00b1 7) %, P = 0.02), especially in males ((66 \u00b1 9)% vs (61 \u00b1 13) %, P = 0.02; (38 \u00b1 10) % vs (33 \u00b1 9) %, P = 0.01)) . Furthermore, the percentage of CD3(+) lymphocytes had a positive correlation with the course of PD in male patients (r = 0.329, P = 0.013, \u03b2 = 1.423). And a negative correlation existed between the percentage of CD3(+)CD4(+) lymphocytes and the course of PD and there was a positive correlation with NMSS scale in female PD patients (r = -0.309, P = 0.045, \u03b2 = -0.354; r = 0.370, P = 0.020, \u03b2 = 0.486).\nThe variants in subpopulation of peripheral lymphocytes in PD patients may serve as a potential biomarker for diagnosing PD and predicting its clinical course.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which is characterized by neuroinflammation, dopaminergic neuronal cell death and motor dysfunction, and for which there are no proven effective treatments. The negative correlation between tobacco consumption and PD suggests that tobacco-derived compounds can be beneficial against PD. Nicotine, the more studied alkaloid derived from tobacco, is considered to be responsible for the beneficial behavioral and neurological effects of tobacco use in PD. However, several metabolites of nicotine, such as cotinine, also increase in the brain after nicotine administration. The effect of nicotine and some of its derivatives on dopaminergic neurons viability, neuroinflammation, and motor and memory functions, have been investigated using cellular and rodent models of PD. Current evidence shows that nicotine, and some of its derivatives diminish oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the brain and improve synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival of dopaminergic neurons. In vivo these effects resulted in improvements in mood, motor skills and memory in subjects suffering from PD pathology. In this review, we discuss the potential benefits of nicotine and its derivatives for treating PD.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of molecular changes in diseased tissues gives insight into pathophysiological mechanisms and is important for therapeutic development. Genome-wide gene expression analysis has proven valuable for identifying biological processes in neurodegenerative diseases using post mortem human brain tissue and numerous datasets are publically available. However, many studies utilize heterogeneous tissue samples consisting of multiple cell types, all of which contribute to global gene expression values, confounding biological interpretation of the data. In particular, changes in numbers of neuronal and glial cells occurring in neurodegeneration confound transcriptomic analyses, particularly in human brain tissues where sample availability and controls are limited. To identify cell specific gene expression changes in neurodegenerative disease, we have applied our recently published computational deconvolution method, population specific expression analysis (PSEA). PSEA estimates cell-type-specific expression values using reference expression measures, which in the case of brain tissue comprises mRNAs with cell-type-specific expression in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia. As an exercise in PSEA implementation and hypothesis development regarding neurodegenerative diseases, we applied PSEA to Parkinson's and Huntington's disease (PD, HD) datasets. Genes identified as differentially expressed in substantia nigra pars compacta neurons by PSEA were validated using external laser capture microdissection data. Network analysis and Annotation Clustering (DAVID) identified molecular processes implicated by differential gene expression in specific cell types. The results of these analyses provided new insights into the implementation of PSEA in brain tissues and additional refinement of molecular signatures in human HD and PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is marked by neurodegenerative processes that affect the pattern of discharge of basal ganglia neurons. The main features observed in the parkinsonian globus pallidus pars interna (GPi), a subdomain of the basal ganglia that is involved in the regulation of voluntary movement, are pathologically increased and synchronized neuronal activity. How these changes affect the implemented neuronal code is not well understood. Our experimental temporal structure-function analysis shows that in parkinsonian animals the rate-coding window of GPi neurons needed for the proper performance of voluntary actions is reduced. The model of the GPi network that we develop and discuss here reveals indeed that the size of the rate-coding window shrinks as the network activity increases and is expanded if the coupling strength among the neurons is increased. This leads to the novel interpretation that the pathological neuronal synchronization in Parkinson's disease in the GPi is the result of a collective attempt to counterbalance the shrinking of the rate-coding window due to increased activity in GPi neurons.",

PD patients with the onset age of \u226450\u2009yr were defined as \"early-onset\" (EOPD) group (n = 45), while the ones with >50\u2009yr at the time of diagnosis were categorized as the \"typical-onset\" (TOPD) patients (n = 95). Different questionnaires and scales were used for between-group comparisons including PDQ39, HADS (hospital anxiety and depression scale), FSS (fatigue severity scale), MNA (mininutritional assessment), and the UPDRS. Depression score was significantly higher in EOPD group (6.3 (SD = 4.5) versus 4.5 (SD = 4.2), P = 0.02). Among different domains of QoL, emotion score was also significantly higher in the EOPD group (32.3 (SD = 21.6) versus 24.4 (SD = 22.7), P = 0.05). Our findings showed more severe depression and more impaired emotional domain of QoL in early-onset PD patients. Depression and anxiety play an important role to worsen QoL among both EOPD and TOPD patients, while no interaction was observed in the efficacy of these two psychiatric symptoms and the onset age of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Da-Bu-Yin-Wan (DBYW) and Qian-Zheng-San (QZS), two classic traditional Chinese medicinal formulas, were clinically employed to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). Our previous studies demonstrated neuroprotective effects of them on mitochondrial function in PD mice induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The purpose of this research was to investigate their possible mechanisms in the light of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (mitoKATP) channels. The neuroprotective effect of DBYW and QZS on dopamine (DA) neurons in substantia nigra (SN) in the MPTP-induced PD mice was investigated by behavioral test (pole test) and immunohistochemistry. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level in the midbrain tissue was detected by firefly luciferase method. MitoKATP channel subunits SUR1 and Kir6.2 mRNA and protein expressions were tested by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot. It was observed that DBYW and/or QZS served to ameliorate MPTP-induced behavioral impairment and prevent the loss of substantia nigra dopamine neurons, as well as increase ATP level in the midbrain tissue and downregulate SUR1 expression at mRNA and protein levels with no marked influence on Kir6.2. We concluded that DBYW and QZS exhibit neuroprotective effects probably through the regulation of ATP level and mitoKATP channel subunit expressions.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a potentially disabling motor problem in Parkinson's disease (PD) with uncertain etiology. Longitudinal studies of FOG in PD are scarce. We determined the prevalence, incidence, and associated clinical risk factors and concomitants of FOG during prospective long-term follow-up of a population-based PD cohort.\nA community-based prevalent cohort of 232 PD patients was followed prospectively over 12 years. Reassessments were conducted at 4 and 8 years, and then annually. FOG, as well as severity of parkinsonism, motor complications, and psychotic symptoms were assessed by the Unified PD Rating Scale, and cognitive impairment by the Mini-Mental State Examination. Generalized estimating equations were applied to investigate baseline risk factors and concomitants of FOG over time.\nThe point prevalence of FOG at baseline was 27% (95% confidence interval (95%-CI) 22-33%). By study end, 63% (95%-CI 56-69%) of patients had developed FOG. The incidence rate of FOG was 124.2 (95%-CI 101.5-152.1) per 1000 person-years. Motor fluctuations (odds ratio (OR) 3.45; p = 0.036) and higher levodopa dose (OR 1.30/100 mg, p = 0.009) at baseline were independent risk factors of incident FOG. Prevalent FOG over time was additionally associated with features thought to reflect extrastrial, non-dopaminergic pathologies, including PIGD (postural instability/gait difficulty, OR 6.30/10 points, p < 0.001) and psychosis (OR 1.85; p = 0.016).\nThese findings demonstrate that FOG affects the majority of patients in the general PD population and provide support to the hypothesis that alterations in both basal ganglia and extrastriatal brain areas are involved in the pathogenesis of FOG in PD.",

    "abstract": "Testing of new therapeutic strategies for Parkinson's disease (PD) is currently hampered by the lack of relevant and reproducible animal models. Here, we developed a robust rat model for PD by injection of adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAV2/7) encoding \u03b1-synuclein into the substantia nigra, resulting in reproducible nigrostriatal pathology and behavioral deficits in a 4-week time period. Progressive dopaminergic dysfunction was corroborated by histopathologic and biochemical analysis, motor behavior testing and in vivo microdialysis. L-DOPA treatment was found to reverse the behavioral phenotype. Non-invasive positron emission tomography imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy allowed longitudinal monitoring of neurodegeneration. In addition, insoluble \u03b1-synuclein aggregates were formed in this model. This \u03b1-synuclein rat model shows improved face and predictive validity, and therefore offers the possibility to reliably test novel therapeutics. Furthermore, it will be of great value for further research into the molecular pathogenesis of PD and the importance of \u03b1-synuclein aggregation in the disease process.",

    "abstract": "The pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the appearance of intracytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies in which its principal component is \u03b1-synuclein.\nThis study aimed to determine salivary \u03b1-synuclein and the extinction coefficient of the saliva protein as biomarkers of PD.\nThis observational study was done in Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine in cooperation with Department of Oral Medicine, College of Dentistry at Al-Mustansiriya University in Baghdad, Iraq from September 2013 to March 2014. A total number of 20 PD patients and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. Unstimulated saliva obtained from each participant obtained for determination of salivary flow rate, saliva protein and \u03b1-synuclein using enzyme linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) technique.\nTotal saliva protein and uncontaminated protein with nucleic acids are significantly higher in PD compared with healthy subjects. The mean extinction coefficient of that protein is 27.25 M.cm(-1) which significantly (P < 0.001) less than corresponding value of healthy subjects (33.48 M.cm(-1) ). Saliva \u03b1-synuclein level is significantly less in PD (65 \u00b1 52.2 pg/ml) than healthy subjects (314.01 \u00b1 435.9 pg/ml).\nWe conclude that saliva \u03b1-synuclein serves as a biomarker for PD if its level compared with healthy subjects, and a specific protein with extinction coefficient 27.25 M.cm-1 is detected in saliva of Parkinson's patients.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) represents a major challenge for clinicians treating patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD). Although levodopa is the most effective treatment for PD, the remodeling effects induced by disease progression and the pharmacologic treatment itself cause a narrowing of the therapeutic window because of the development of LID. Although animal models of PD provide strong evidence that striatal plasticity underlies the development of dyskinetic movements, the pathogenesis of LID is not entirely understood. In recent years, slow homeostatic adjustment of intrinsic excitability occurring during sleep has been considered fundamental for network stabilization by gradually modifying plasticity thresholds. So far, how sleep affects on LID has not been investigated. Therefore, we measured synaptic downscaling across sleep episodes in a parkinsonian animal model showing dyskinetic movements similar to LID. Our electrophysiological, molecular, and behavioral results are consistent with an impaired synaptic homeostasis during sleep in animals showing dyskinesia. Accordingly, sleep deprivation causes an anticipation and worsening of LID supporting a link between sleep and the development of LID.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), due to both the disease itself and anti-PD drugs. We hypothesized that transdermal drug administration may result in fewer GI problems. This prospective observational study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01159691) investigated effect of switching to rotigotine transdermal patch from oral anti-PD medications in patients with PD and existing GI symptoms.\nPatients were enrolled if their physician was planning to switch them to rotigotine because of GI symptoms experienced while receiving oral anti-PD medications. Effectiveness assessments included a visual analog scale (VAS) measuring intensity of GI symptoms from 0 (no disorder) to 100 mm (extremely severe disorder), a questionnaire on the frequency and intensity of six individual GI complaints (heartburn, bloating, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea), each rated 0-12 for a sum score of 0-72, and patient satisfaction regarding GI symptoms over approximately 6 weeks after switching.\nOf 75 patients who received rotigotine, 58 had follow-up data available for final analysis. Intensity of GI complaints improved numerically on both the VAS (47.5 \u00b1 24.4 mm [n = 65] at baseline, 19.7 \u00b1 23.3 mm [n = 58] after around 6 weeks) and the sum score of GI complaints (11.2 \u00b1 9.0 at baseline, 2.1 \u00b1 4.4 [n = 58] after around 6 weeks). Fifty of 58 patients were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" regarding GI symptoms over around 6 weeks following switch to the patch.\nThis study suggests that a switch from oral anti-PD medications to rotigotine transdermal patch may improve existing GI symptoms among patients with PD. Additional controlled studies are needed to confirm this finding.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the striatum. Previous studies indicated that subdivisions of the striatum with distinct functional connectivity profiles contribute to different pathogeneses in PD. Segregated structural covariance (SC) pattern between the striatum and neocortex observed in healthy subjects, however, remain unknown in PD. The purpose of this study is to map and compare the subregional striatal SC network organization between 30 healthy controls and 48 PD patients and to investigate their association with the disease severity. The striatal SC network was statistically inferred by correlating the mean gray matter (GM) volume of six striatal subdivisions (including the bilateral dorsal caudate, superior ventral striatum, inferior ventral striatum, dorsal caudal putamen, dorsal rostral putamen, and ventral rostral putamen) with the entire neocortical GM volume in voxel-wise manner. The PD patients revealed marked atrophy in the striatum, cerebellum, and extra-striatum neocortices. As predicted, segregated striatal SC network patterns were observed in both groups. This suggests that in PD, pathological processes occurring in the striatum affect the same striato-cortical networks that covary with the striatum in healthy brains. The PD patients further demonstrated atypical striatal SC patterns between the caudate, parahippocampus temporal cortices, and cerebellum, which corresponded to dopaminergic associated network. The areas with significant group differences in SC were further associated with disease severity. Our findings support previous studies indicating that PD is associated with altered striato-cortical networks, and suggest that structural changes in the striatum may result in a cascade of alterations in multiple neocortices.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin C is a major antioxidant and also is known as a neuromodulator in dopaminergic neurons. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between lymphocyte and plasma vitamin C levels in various stages of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nSixty-two individuals with PD (age 71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.8\u00a0y [mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD]) being treated at Shizuoka General Hospital from December 2007 to August 2013 were consecutively recruited. PD severity was classified using the Hoehn-Yahr scale for staging PD. Fasting blood samples were collected, and plasma and lymphocyte vitamin C levels were measured. The association between PD severity and vitamin C levels was estimated by ordinal logistic regression with confounding variables.\nThe distribution of Hoehn-Yahr stages in patients was as follows: stage I, 7; II, 28; III, 16; and IV, 11. Lymphocyte vitamin C levels in patients with severe PD were significantly lower (odds ratio [OR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.97; P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) compared with those at less severe stages. Plasma vitamin C levels also tended to be lower in patients with severe PD; however, this was not significant (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-1.00; P\u00a0=\u00a00.09).\nOur findings suggest that lymphocyte vitamin C levels in the peripheral blood may be a potentially useful biomarker for the progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the effects of selenium (Se) on locomotor activity and DNA damage in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) induced by paraquat (PQ).\nForty-eight male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control group (n\u00a0=\u00a012), Se group (n\u00a0=\u00a012), PQ group (n\u00a0=\u00a012), and Se\u00a0+\u00a0PQ group (n\u00a0=\u00a012). PQ was administered intraperitoneally (10\u00a0mg/kg). Se was offered in the drinking water at a concentration of 11.18\u00a0\u03bcg/L. Locomotor activity was evaluated weekly using the narrow beam test. The comet assay was performed to assess the level of DNA damage in leukocytes and in brain cells.\nAs expected, increased DNA damage was found in the PQ group compared with the control and Se groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Interestingly, coadministration of Se and PQ effectively prevented the harmful effects of the toxin in locomotor activity and at the molecular level, reducing bradykinesia (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and DNA damage in leukocytes compared with the PQ-only group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), whereas the levels of DNA damage were comparable to those found in the control and Se groups (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Using the comet assay to analyze brain cells, no differences were found between the groups with regard to damage index (P\u00a0=\u00a00.774), damage frequency (P\u00a0=\u00a00.817), or non-detectable cell nuclei (P\u00a0=\u00a00.481).\nIn this experimental model of PQ-induced PD, the use of Se could contribute to the maintenance of locomotor activity and the integrity of leukocytes DNA.

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that abnormal synchronization and oscillation of neuronal activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is associated with sensorimotor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the bilateral subcortico-cortical functional coupling in PD patients.\nWe simultaneously recorded local field potentials from the bilateral STN using electrodes inserted for deep brain stimulation and electroencephalograms from the bilateral motor cortices (MCx) in 11 patients at rest, and analyzed their coherences and causalities.\nSignificant coherence in the sub-beta and beta frequency bands was simultaneously observed between the STN and contralateral STN (STN-cSTN), the STN and ipsilateral MCx (STN-iMCx), and the STN and contralateral MCx (STN-cMCx). In each patient, the frequency of the peak STN-cSTN coherence was similar to that of the peak STN-iMCx and STN-cMCx coherence. The causality between the STN and MCx was strongest in the one-way direction from the MCx to the ipsilateral STN.\nAbnormal oscillations in the STN in the sub-beta and beta bands were functionally coupled among bilateral STN and MCx at the eigen-frequency in individual patients with PD.\nSynchronized activity through cortico-subcortical transmission may have an important role in the pathophysiology of PD.",

    "abstract": "Growth and development of neuroepidemiology in India during the last four decades has been documented highlighting the historical milestones. The prevalence rates of the spectrum of neurological disorders from different regions of the country ranged from 967-4,070 with a mean of 2394 per 100,000 population, providing a rough estimate of over 30 million people with neurological disorders (excluding neuroinfections and traumatic injuries). Prevalence and incidence rates of common disorders including epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson's disease and tremors determined through population-based surveys show considerable variation across different regions of the country. The need for a standardized screening questionnaire, uniform methodology for case ascertainment and diagnosis is an essential requiste for generating robust national data on neurological disorders. Higher rates of prevalence of neurological disorders in rural areas, 6-8 million people with epilepsy and high case fatality rates of stroke (27-42%) call for urgent strategies to establish outreach neurology services to cater to remote and rural areas, develop National Epilepsy Control Program and establish stroke units at different levels of health care pyramid.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine has a significant role in retinal processing, and it has been demonstrated that retinal dopamine content is decreased in parkinsonian patients. We measured the latency of the evoked discharges in the optic tract (OT) to flash stimuli during stereotactic pallidal neurosurgery in 25 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (13 women and 12 men, age 38-78 years, unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) Motor Score in the Off state 11-54, Hoehn and Yahr stage in the Off state 1.5-5) and investigated the effects of age at surgery, disease duration, levodopa dose, and severity of parkinsonian symptoms on the latency. OT discharges were evoked by monocular flash stimuli delivered from a flashlight with a krypton bulb with a tungsten filament. The luminance at the eye measured \u223c4 \u00d7 10(4) cd/m(2). The light wavelength of the stimulus was composed of a wide spectrum with its peak at around 800 nm or longer. The latency of OT discharges ranged 49-79 msec, and there was a significant positive correlation between the latencies of evoked activities in the OT to a flashlight and age (r = 0.59, P < 0.001, by Pearson correlation), but no correlation between the latency and the severity of parkinsonian symptoms and between the latency and duration of illness. These results indicate that the delay in visual processing and conduction at the level of the retina and the OT are substantially derived from age-related degenerative changes in the retina and visual pathway which are apparently unrelated to the striatal dopamine deficiency in PD.",

    "abstract": "Objective. To evaluate a new method of measuring hemoglobin (Hb) levels and quantifying the color changes in the optic nerve head of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We also compared differences in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thicknesses obtained using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) device between PD group and healthy group. Methods. One hundred and fifty-five PD patients and 91 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects were included in this cross-sectional study. OCT examinations and one photograph of the optic disc were performed. The Laguna ONhE (\"optic nerve hemoglobin\"; Insoft SL, Tenerife, Spain) software was used to analyze the Hb level on the acquired optic disc photographs. Results. PD patients exhibited significantly reduced mean optic disc Hb percentages (57.56% in PD, 67.63% in healthy subjects; P = 0.001) as well as reduced Hb in almost all analyzed sectors, with the largest differences detected in the inferior and nasal sectors. RNFL parameters were significantly reduced in PD patients compared with healthy subjects, especially in the inferior quadrant. Conclusions. Measurements of optic disc Hb levels obtained with the Laguna ONhE software had good ability to detect optic nerve color changes (more papillary paleness and consequently this could suggest optic atrophy and axonal loss) in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory mediators may reflect a role of systemic inflammation in the neurodegenerative process of Parkinson's disease (PD). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), also known as RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including PD. Serum levels of RANTES and IL-6 of 78 consecutive PD patients and age-matched 80 controls were measured. Patients with PD had higher RANTES and IL-6 levels compared with the controls. We found that serum RANTES levels strongly correlated with Hoehn-Yahr score and disease duration in PD patients. This study indicated that patients with PD have an on-going systemic inflammatory profile where the elevated peripheral production of RANTES may play a role in the neurodegenerative process.",

    "abstract": "To assess the efficacy and safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants(TCAs) in treatment of Parkinsonian\u00a0depression. A computer-based search was conducted in the databases of PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CochraneControlled Trails Register up to December 2011. The random controlled clinic trials about SSRIs and TCAs in treatment of Parkinsonian\u00a0depression were collected. Statistical analysis was completed using Review Manager, version 5.0. Five clinic controlled trials were identified for this meta-analysis. There was no significant statistical difference in the response rate of treatment [RR 0.95, 95%CI (0.78, 1.16)] and Hamilton depression\u00a0score [RR -2.54, 95%CI (-5.35, 0.26)] between two groups. In term of complications, no statistical difference was observed in the insomnia rate between two groups [RR 0.82, 95%CI (0.24, 2.84)]. Moreover, the incidence rate of xerostomia [RR 0.21, 95%CI (0.07, 0.65)] and constipation [RR 0.12, 95%CI(0.02, 0.63)] was lower in SSRIs group rather than those in TCAs group. In general, SSRIs and TCAs have comparable efficacy and equal acceptability in treatment of Parkinson's disease-induced depression. However, SSRIs are superior to TCAs in the terms of xerostomia and constipation.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent oral delivery of levodopa is a major contributing factor for motor complications in Parkinson's disease (PD). Continuous infusion of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) into the jejunum using a portable pump via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) improves motor complications and quality of life (QoL).\nTo record long-term effectiveness of advanced PD patients undergoing LCIG infusion in routine care, by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), PDQ-8 and EQ-5D questionnaires.\nOverall, 375 patients from 75 movement disorder centers in 18 countries were enrolled in this prospective non-interventional study. The 12-month interim outcomes of the first 172 included patients are presented here.\nThere were reductions of mean daily \"Off\" time from baseline (BL) (7.1 \u00b1 3.5 h) and \"On\" time with dyskinesias (5.2 \u00b1 4.5 h) at month 12 (M12) of -4.7 \u00b1 3.4 and -1.7 \u00b1 5.0 h respectively (p < 0.0001; p = 0.0228). UPDRS II and III \"On\" scores decreased from BL to M12 (p = 0.0107 and p = 0.0128). Total NMSS and PDQ-8 scores improved at M12 (p = 0.0014 and p = 0.0100). Mean LCIG dose administered through PEG at first visit (day after implantation) was 1304 \u00b1 618 mg/day and remained stable through M12. Continuous LCIG infusion tolerability and adverse drug reactions were consistent with the known safety profile of previous studies.\nThis observational, routine-care study supports long-term safety and efficacy of LCIG infusion in advanced PD including motor, non-motor and QoL improvements.",

    "abstract": "Timed single-leg-stance test (SLST) is widely used to assess postural control in the elderly. In Parkinson's disease (PD), it has been shown that an SLST around 10 seconds or below may be a sensitive indicator of future falls. However, despite its role in fall risk, whether SLST times around 10 seconds marks a clinically important stage of disease progression has largely remained unexplored.\nA cross-sectional study where 27 people with PD were recruited and instructed to undertake timed SLST for both legs was conducted. Disease motor impairment was assessed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part 3 (UPDRS-III).\nThis study found that: 1) the SLST in people with PD shows good test-retest reliability; 2) SLST values can be attributed to two non-overlapping clusters: a low (10.4 \u00b1 6.3 seconds) and a high (47.6 \u00b1 11.7 seconds) value SLST group; 3) only the low value SLST group can be considered abnormal when age-matched normative SLST data are taken into account for comparison; and 4) lower UPDRS-III motor performance, and the bradykinesia sub-score in particular, are only associated with the low SLST group.\nThese results lend further support that a low SLST time around 10 seconds marks a clinically important stage of disease progression with significant worsening of postural stability in PD.",

    "abstract": "Unlike dementia, the effect of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on outcomes after deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is less clear. We aimed to examine the effect of MCI on short- and long-term DBS outcomes.\nTo study the effect of MCI type, cognitive domains (attention, language, visuospatial, memory, executive function), and Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) score on immediate postoperative outcomes (postoperative confusion, hospitalization days), PD patients who underwent DBS at our Center from 2006 to 2011 were analyzed. To determine cognitive predictors of intermediate (6-month) and long-term (1-year) post-operative outcomes, the changes in functional and quality-of-life (QOL) scores were analyzed in a smaller group with available preoperative health status measures.\nWe identified 130 patients [71% male, mean age: 63 \u00b1 9.1, mean PD duration: 10.7 \u00b1 5.1]. At preoperative assessment, 60% of patients had multiple-domain MCI, 21% had single-domain MCI, and 19% had normal cognition. MCI presence and type as well as DRS performance did not affect immediate outcomes. Attention impairment predicted longer postoperative hospitalization (P = 0.0015) and showed a trend towards occurrence of postoperative confusion (P = 0.089). For intermediate and long-term outcomes we identified 56 patients [73.2% male, mean age: 61.3 \u00b1 9.6, mean PD duration: 10.6 \u00b1 4.7]. Visuospatial impairment showed a trend towards less improvement in 6-month functional score (P = 0.0652), and 1-year QOL score (P = 0.0517).\nThe presence of MCI did not affect DBS outcomes. However, the types of impaired domains were more detrimental. Detailed cognitive testing can help stratify low- and high-risk patients based on their pattern of cognitive dysfunction.",

At preoperative assessment, 60% of patients had multiple-domain MCI, 21% had single-domain MCI, and 19% had normal cognition. MCI presence and type as well as DRS performance did not affect immediate outcomes. Attention impairment predicted longer postoperative hospitalization (P = 0.0015) and showed a trend towards occurrence of postoperative confusion (P = 0.089). For intermediate and long-term outcomes we identified 56 patients [73.2% male, mean age: 61.3 \u00b1 9.6, mean PD duration: 10.6 \u00b1 4.7]. Visuospatial impairment showed a trend towards less improvement in 6-month functional score (P = 0.0652), and 1-year QOL score (P = 0.0517).",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation is associated with differences in the function of the brain as well as its susceptibility to disease. The common H1 haplotypic variant of the microtubule-associated protein tau gene (MAPT) has been related to an increased risk for Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, among PD patients, H1 homozygotes have an accelerated progression to dementia. We investigated the neurocognitive correlates of MAPT haplotypes using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Thirty-seven nondemented patients with PD (19 H1/H1, 18 H2 carriers) and 40 age-matched controls (21 H1/H1, 19 H2 carriers) were scanned during performance of a picture memory encoding task. Behaviorally, H1 homozygosity was associated with impaired picture recognition memory in PD patients and control subjects. These impairments in the H1 homozygotes were accompanied by an altered blood-oxygen level-dependent response in the medial temporal lobe during successful memory encoding. Additional age-related differences in blood-oxygen level-dependent response were observed in the medial temporal lobes of H1 homozygotes with PD. These results suggest that common variation in MAPT is not only associated with the dementia of PD but also differences in the neural circuitry underlying aspects of cognition in normal aging.",

    "abstract": "Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common issue in Parkinson's disease (PD), affecting about 30%-40% of PD patients. Symptoms of OH include lightheadedness, dizziness, postural instability, vertigo and blurred vision. OH considerably contributes to disease burden and reduced quality of life for PD patients.\nTo determine whether the severity of OH in PD advances significantly with the duration of the disease.\nFor 106 PD patients lying-to-standing orthostatic tests were performed to evaluate orthostasis. Severity of OH was measured as maximal drop of systolic blood pressure (SBP) after postural challenge, as the mean of three measurements. The relationship between the maximal drop of SBP and the duration of PD was tested applying ANOVA. Consecutively, 64 patients under regular ambulant supervision received appointments to evaluate their orthostasis repeatedly. From these patients a separate cohort was set up to investigate OH progression in the course of PD.\nThe lack of a correlation between the severity of OH in PD and the duration of the disease was determined (p = 0.064). The long term analysis for the patients under regular ambulant supervision demonstrated that the severity of OH does not advance in the course of PD in a statistically significant manner (p = 0.83).\nOH does not appear to be a symptom only of the late stage of PD. The presence of OH along with early motor signs does not necessarily point to multiple system atrophy.",

    "abstract": "There is no consensus on the association between exposure to hydrocarbons and the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise the epidemiological evidence and included a new large case-control study.\nData were extracted following a predefined protocol. Risk estimates regarding the association between hydrocarbon exposure and PD were consolidated to produce a summary odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and p-value. In our case-control study, 1463 PD patients and 685 controls were recruited from clinical trials and completed a structured questionnaire describing their previous working exposure to hydrocarbons and other demographic measures. The association between exposure to hydrocarbons and risk of PD was evaluated using logistic regression.\nThe systematic search identified 13 case-control studies matching the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis included 3020 PD cases and 6494 controls. The summary OR was 1.32 (95% CI 1.08-1.62, p = 0.006) for hydrocarbon exposure (ever versus never). In the PD GEN study, occupational exposure to hydrocarbons significantly increased the risk of PD (OR = 1.61; 95% CI 1.10-2.36, p = 0.014), and risk dose-dependently increased for subjects exposed greater than 10 years compared to subjects never exposed (OR = 2.19; 95% CI 1.13-4.26, p = 0.021). The addition of PD GEN data increased the total numbers to 4483 PD cases and 7179 controls and strengthened the significant association (summary OR = 1.36; 95% CI 1.13-1.63, p = 0.001).\nThis systematic review supports a positive association between hydrocarbon exposure and PD.

    "abstract": "Several functional neuroimaging studies in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have suggested that changes in the fronto-parietal-striatal networks are associated with deficits in executive functioning. However, executive functions (EF) are multifaceted and include three dissociable components: working memory, response inhibition, and task-switching. This study investigated which component of executive functioning is most strongly associated with fronto-parietal-striatal efficiency in PD. PD patients (with and without executive dysfunction), and age-matched healthy subjects, completed a battery of cognitive tests previously shown to discriminate among the three EF components. Principal component analysis conducted on the selected cognitive test variables yielded three expected EF components. The component scores were used in regression analysis to assess the relationship between the EF efficiency and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal related to performing the n-back, an experimental task that draws upon multiple components of executive functioning: working memory, response inhibition, and task-switching. We found distinct neural correlates of specific executive dysfunctions in patients with PD. However, all of them seem to be associated with fronto-parietal-striatal efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Systemic rotenone models of Parkinson's disease (PD) are highly reproducible and may provide evidence on the pathogenesis of PD. In the present study, male Sprague-Dawley rats (1-year-old) were subcutaneously administered with rotenone (1.5 mg/kg/day) for six days and observed for the following three weeks. Compared with the control rats, a significant decrease was observed in the body weight and a marked increase was observed in the areas under the behavioral scoring curves in the rotenone-treated rats. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the abundance of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons was markedly reduced following rotenone treatment. ELISA and neurochemical assays demonstrated a significant increase in the levels of nitric oxide (NO) and NO synthase, whereas a marked decrease was observed in the thiol levels in the brains of the rotenone-treated rats. Thus, subacute rotenone treatment was found to induce behavioral deficits and the loss of nigral TH-positive neurons which may be associated with the excessive levels of NO in the rat brains.",

    "abstract": "Balance problems contribute to reduced quality of life in Parkinson's disease (PD) and available treatments are often insufficient for treating axial and postural motor symptoms.\nTo investigate the safety of use and possible effects of stochastic vestibular stimulation (SVS) alone and combined with LDOPA in patients with PD.\nSVS or sham stimulation was administered to 10 PD patients in a double-blind placebo controlled cross-over pilot study. Motor symptoms and balance were evaluated in a defined off-medication state and after a 200 mg test dose of LDOPA, using UPDRS-III, Posturo-Locomotor-Manual (PLM) movement times (MT), static posturography and force plate measurements of the correcting response to a balance perturbation.\nPatients did not detect when SVS was active, but SVS increased nausea after LDOPA in two patients. Mixed model analysis demonstrated that SVS improved balance corrections after a backward perturbation and shortened the postural response time. In static posturography there was significant interaction between effects of SVS, medication and proprioceptive input (standing on foam vs. on hard support) and SVS decreased the total sway-path with eyes closed and off medication. As expected, LDOPA improved the UPDRS-III scores and MT. There was an interaction between the effect of SVS and LDOPA on UPDRS-III partly because of reduced UPDRS-III scores with SVS in the off-medication state.\nShort term use of SVS is safe, improves corrective postural responses and may have a small positive effect on motor symptoms in PD patients off treatment.",

    "abstract": "There are few large studies that have evaluated prognostic factors for mortality in Parkinson's disease (PD). This large study aimed to identify demographic and clinical features associated with early mortality in PD.\nPD patients at the National Neuroscience Institute were identified from the Movement Disorders Database from which demographic information and prospectively collected baseline disease characteristics were obtained. All study patients were linked to the Singapore Registry of Birth and Death to obtain information on vital status through December 31, 2012. The prognostic variables analyzed include patient demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and type of PD medication used. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was carried out to identify factors associated with the risk of mortality in PD.\nOf the 1786 PD patients identified, 363 (20.3%) had died during the 11-year study period. Median survival time from diagnosis was 15.8 years (range 0.3-31). Factors associated with higher mortality (HR, 95% CI) were older age at diagnosis (1.06, 1.03-1.08), male gender (2.29, 1.57-3.35), Hoehn & Yahr (HY) stage \u2265 2.5 (1.54, 1.07-2.22), UPDRS motor score \u2265 30 (1.63, 1.13-2.35), higher bradykinesia subscores (1.05, 1.01-1.09) and cognitive impairment (2.30, 1.55-3.41).\nIn the largest study to date evaluating baseline disease characteristics prognostic of mortality risk in PD, we found that male gender, older age at diagnosis, higher baseline HY stage, higher baseline UPDRS motor scores, higher bradykinesia subscores and baseline cognitive impairment were associated with early mortality in PD.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have categorized falls in early Parkinson's disease (PD) and little is known about falls incidence and evolution. Fall incidence and frequency are reported to be 'U' shaped with respect to disease severity and may be influenced by time spent engaged in ambulatory activity.\nTwelve months prospective falls in an incident PD cohort (n = 111) were reported and the relationship between falls and ambulatory activity was examined in a subgroup (n = 83). Fall events were collected using standardised protocols and were categorized by fall frequency (non-faller, single fall, recurrent falls) and also by a novel classification based on pre-fall event: (1) engaged in advanced activity; (2) ambulation; and (3) transition. Non-parametric statistics compared groups in both classifications.\nAt baseline 23 (20.7%) of the cohort had fallen, increasing to 41 (36.9%) participants over 12 months. Total time spent walking was significantly lower for transition fallers compared with non-fallers and ambulation fallers (p = 0.041), who also had significantly increased disease severity. There were no significant relationships when fallers were categorized by frequency. We present an inverted U curve model depicting the relationship between falls and activity over time in PD, and propose that at this stage transition and ambulation fallers occupy different places on the curve.\nFalls are more common than recognised in newly-diagnosed PD. Daily activity is reduced even in early disease for people who fall during transitions. Classification methods that take pre-fall event into account may be useful to understand the heterogeneity of this complex problem.",

    "abstract": "Relay cells are prevalent throughout sensory systems and receive two types of inputs: driving and modulating. The driving input contains receptive field properties that must be transmitted while the modulating input alters the specifics of transmission. Relay reliability of a relay cell is defined as the fraction of pulses in the driving input that generate action potentials at the neuron's output, and is in general a complicated function of the driving input, the modulating input and the cell's properties. In a recent study, we computed analytic bounds on the reliability of relay neurons for a class of Poisson driving inputs and sinusoidal modulating inputs. Here, we generalize our analysis and compute bounds on the relay reliability for any modulating input. Furthermore, we show that if the modulating input is generated by a colored Gaussian process, closed form expressions for bounds on relay reliability can be derived. We applied our analysis to investigate relay reliability of thalamic cells in health and in Parkinson's disease (PD). It is hypothesized that in health, neurons in the motor thalamus relay information only when needed and this capability is compromised in PD due to exaggerated beta-band oscillations in the modulating input from the basal ganglia (BG). To test this hypothesis, we used modulating and driving inputs simulated from a detailed computational model of the cortico-BG-thalamo-cortical motor loop and computed our theoretical bounds in both PD and healthy conditions. Our bounds match well with our empirically computed reliability and show that the relay reliability is larger in the healthy condition across the population of thalamic neurons. Furthermore, we show that the increase in power in the beta-band of the modulating input (output of BG) is causally related with the decrease in relay reliability in the PD condition.",

    "abstract": "Humans are living longer but morbidity has also increased; threatening to create a serious global burden. Our approach is to monitor gait for early warning signs of morbidity. Here we present highlights from a series of experiments into gait as a potential biomarker for Parkinson's disease (PD), ageing and fall risk. Using body-worn accelerometers, we developed several novel camera-less methods to analyze head and pelvis movements while walking. Signal processing algorithms were developed to extract gait parameters that represented the principal components of vigor, head jerk, lateral harmonic stability, and oscillation range. The new gait parameters were compared to accidental falls, mental state and co-morbidities. We observed: 1) People with PD had significantly larger and uncontrolled anterioposterior (AP) oscillations of the head; 2) Older people walked with more lateral head jerk; and, 3) the combination of vigorous and harmonically stable gait was demonstrated by non-fallers. Our findings agree with research from other groups; changes in human gait reflect changes to well-being. We observed; different aspects of gait reflected different functional outcomes. The new gait parameters therefore may be complementary to existing methods and may have potential as biomarkers for specific disorders. However, further research is required to validate our observations, and establish clinical utility.",

Specially, gait can benefit from repetitive sessions of exercises using auditory cues. Nevertheless, all the experiments are based on the use of a metronome as auditory stimuli. Within this work, Human-Computer Interaction methodologies have been used to design new cues that could benefit the long-term engagement of PD patients in these repetitive routines. The study has been also extended to commercial music and musical pieces by analyzing features and characteristics that could benefit the engagement of PD patients to rehabilitation tasks.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease, there exists a prodromal or a premotor phase characterized by symptoms like olfactory loss and sleep disorders, which may last for years or even decades before the onset of motor clinical symptoms. Diagnostic tools based on machine learning using these features can be very useful as they have the potential in early diagnosis of the disease. In the paper, we use olfactory loss feature from 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and Sleep behavior disorder feature from Rapid eye movement sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ), obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Marker's Initiative (PPMI) database, to develop automated diagnostic models using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and classification tree methods. The advantage of using UPSIT and RBDSQ is that they are quick, cheap, and can be self-administered. Results show that the models performed with high accuracy and sensitivity, and that they have the potential to aid in early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Two tri-axial accelerometers were placed on the wrists (one on each hand) of the patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and a non-PD control group. Subjects were asked to perform three of the upper extremity motor function tasks from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) test. The tasks were: 1) finger tapping, 2) opening and closing of palms, and 3) pronation-supination movements of the forearms. The inertia signals were wirelessly received and stored on a computer for further off-line analysis. Various features such as range, standard deviation, entropy, time to accomplish the task, and maximum frequency present in the signal were extracted and compared. The results showed that among the studied population, \"standard deviation\", \"range\", \"entropy\", \"time\" and \"max frequency\" are the best to worst features, respectively, to distinguish between the non-PD and PD subjects. Furthermore, using the mentioned features, it is more probable to distinguish between the non-PD and PD subjects from tasks 2 and 3 as opposed to task 1.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is known to lead to marked alterations in cortical-basal ganglia activity that may be amenable to serve as a biomarker for PD diagnosis. Using non-linear delay differential equations (DDE) for classification of PD patients on and off dopaminergic therapy (PD-on, PD-off, respectively) from healthy age-matched controls (CO), we show that 1 second of quasi-resting state clean and raw electroencephalogram (EEG) data can be used to classify CO from PD-on/off based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC). Raw EEG is shown to classify more robustly (AROC=0.59-0.86) than clean EEG data (AROC=0.57-0.72). Decomposition of the raw data into stereotypical and non-stereotypical artifacts provides evidence that increased classification of raw EEG time series originates from muscle artifacts. Thus, non-linear feature extraction and classification of raw EEG data in a low dimensional feature space is a potential biomarker for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment method for motor symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease. DBS-electrode is implanted to subthalamic nucleus to give precisely allocated electrical stimuli to brain. The optimal stimulus type has to be adjusted individually. Disease severity, main symptoms and biological factors play a role in correctly setting up the device. Currently there are no objective methods to assess the efficacy of DBS, hence the adjustment is based solely on clinical assessment. In optimal case an objectively measurable feature would point the right settings of DBS. Surface electromyographic and kinematic measurements have been used in Parkinson's disease research. As Parkinson's disease symptoms are known to change the EMG signal properties, these methods could be helpful aid in the clinical adjustment of DBS. In this study, 13 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received DBS treatment were measured. The patients were measured with seven different settings of the DBS in clinical range including changes in stimulation amplitude, frequency and pulse width. The EMG analysis was based on parameters that characterize EMG signal morphology. Correlation dimension and recurrence rate made the most significant difference in relation to optimal settings. In conclusion, EMG analysis is able to detect differences between the DBS setups, and can help in finding the correct parameters.",

    "abstract": "Movement-related diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), progressively affect the motor function, many times leading to severe motor impairment and dramatic loss of the patients' quality of life. Human motion analysis techniques can be very useful to support clinical assessment of this type of diseases. In this contribution, we present a RGB-D camera (Microsoft Kinect) system and its evaluation for PD assessment. Based on skeleton data extracted from the gait of three PD patients treated with deep brain stimulation and three control subjects, several gait parameters were computed and analyzed, with the aim of discriminating between non-PD and PD subjects, as well as between two PD states (stimulator ON and OFF). We verified that among the several quantitative gait parameters, the variance of the center shoulder velocity presented the highest discriminative power to distinguish between non-PD, PD ON and PD OFF states (p = 0.004). Furthermore, we have shown that our low-cost portable system can be easily mounted in any hospital environment for evaluating patients' gait. These results demonstrate the potential of using a RGB-D camera as a PD assessment tool.",

    "abstract": "Advanced hardware components embedded in modern smartphones have the potential to serve as widely available medical diagnostic devices, particularly when used in conjunction with custom software and tested algorithms. The goal of the present pilot study was to develop a smartphone application that could quantify the severity of Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms, and in particular, bradykinesia. We developed an iPhone application that collected kinematic data from a small cohort of PD patients during guided movement tasks and extracted quantitative features using signal processing techniques. These features were used in a classification model trained to differentiate between overall motor impairment of greater and lesser severity using standard clinical scores provided by a trained neurologist. Using a support vector machine classifier, a classification accuracy of 0.945 was achieved under 6-fold cross validation, and several features were shown to be highly discriminatory between more severe and less severe motor impairment by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC > 0.85). Accurate classification for discriminating between more severe and less severe bradykinesia was not achieved with these methods. We discuss future directions of this work and suggest that this platform is a first step toward development of a smartphone application that has the potential to provide clinicians with a method for monitoring patients between clinical appointments.",

    "abstract": "The Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has become a well-accepted treatment for Parkinson's disease patients around the world. However, postoperative care of the stimulators usually puts a heavy burden on the patients' families, especially in China. To solve the problem, this study developed a real-time remote monitoring system for deep brain stimulators. Based on Internet technologies, the system offers remote adjustment service so that in vivo stimulators could be programmed at patients' home by clinic caregivers. We tested the system on an experimental condition and the results have proved that this early exploration of remote monitoring deep brain stimulators was successful.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) is the best method for treating advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), leading to striking improvements in motor function and quality of life of PD patients. During DBS, online analysis of microelectrode recording (MER) signals is a powerful tool to locate the STN. Therapeutic outcomes depend of a precise positioning of a stimulator device in the target area. In this paper, we show how a sparse representation of MER signals allows to extract discriminant features, improving the accuracy in identification of STN. We apply three techniques for over-complete representation of signals: Method of Frames (MOF), Best Orthogonal Basis (BOB) and Basis Pursuit (BP). All the techniques are compared to classical methods for signal processing like Wavelet Transform (WT), and a more sophisticated method known as adaptive Wavelet with lifting schemes (AW-LS). We apply each processing method in two real databases and we evaluate its performance with simple supervised classifiers. Classification outcomes for MOF, BOB and BP clearly outperform WT and AW-LF in all classifiers for both databases, reaching accuracy values over 98%.",

    "abstract": "Akinetic crisis or acute akinesia is a life-threatening complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) with unknown pathophysiological mechanisms. Clinically, it resembles the neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and dopaminergic drugs are transiently ineffective in the acute phase of the condition. There are no published dopaminergic functional imaging studies on PD patients with akinetic crisis. Here we report 2 advanced PD patients with akinetic crisis who were scanned with SPECT using brain dopamine transporter ligand [(123)I]FP-CIT. The first patient was additionally scanned before the condition developed, and the second patient was scanned after recovery. Striatal dopamine transporter binding was lower during than before the crisis, and both patients showed a nearly complete loss of dopamine transporter binding during the crisis. Serial imaging showed that the uptake remained negligible despite an improvement in motor function after recovery. Akinetic crisis in PD appears to be associated with a particularly severe loss of presynaptic striatal dopamine function that does not improve after recovery. Apart from presynaptic dopaminergic function, other dopaminergic or nondopaminergic mechanisms are involved in the clinical improvement of motor functions after akinetic crisis in PD.",

    "abstract": "Formation and accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates are a central hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson's disease (PD), the aggregation-prone protein alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) is the culprit. In the past few years, another piece of the puzzle has been added with data suggesting that \u03b1-syn may self-propagate, thereby contributing to the progression and extension of PD. Of particular importance, it was the seminal observation of Lewy bodies (LB), a histopathological signature of PD, in grafted fetal dopaminergic neurons in the striatum of PD patients. Consequently, these findings were a conceptual breakthrough, generating the \"host to graft transmission\" hypothesis, also called the \"prion-like hypothesis.\" Several in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that \u03b1-syn can undergo a toxic templated conformational change, spread from cell to cell and from region to region, and initiate the formation of \"LB-like aggregates,\" contributing to the PD pathogenesis. Here, we will review and discuss the current knowledge for such a putative mechanism on the prion-like nature of \u03b1-syn, and discuss about the proper use of the term prion-like.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects about 1.5% of the global population over 65 years of age. A hallmark feature of PD is the degeneration of the dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the consequent striatal DA deficiency. Yet, the pathogenesis of PD remains unclear. Despite tremendous growth in recent years in our knowledge of the molecular basis of PD and the molecular pathways of cell death, important questions remain, such as: (1) why are SNc cells especially vulnerable; (2) which mechanisms underlie progressive SNc cell loss; and (3) what do Lewy bodies or \u03b1-synuclein reveal about disease progression. Understanding the variable vulnerability of the dopaminergic neurons from the midbrain and the mechanisms whereby pathology becomes widespread are some of the primary objectives of research in PD. Animal models are the best tools to study the pathogenesis of PD. The identification of PD-related genes has led to the development of genetic PD models as an alternative to the classical toxin-based ones, but does the dopaminergic neuronal loss in actual animal models adequately recapitulate that of the human disease? The selection of a particular animal model is very important for the specific goals of the different experiments. In this review, we provide a summary of our current knowledge about the different in vivo models of PD that are used in relation to the vulnerability of the dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain in the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Numerous disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) are attributed to the selective death of distinct neuronal cell populations. Interestingly, in many of these conditions, a specific subset of neurons is extremely prone to degeneration while other, very similar neurons are less affected or even spared for many years. In Parkinson's disease (PD), the motor manifestations are primarily linked to the selective, progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). In contrast, the very similar DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) demonstrate a much lower degree of degeneration. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of differential DA vulnerability in PD has proven extremely challenging. Moreover, an increasing number of studies demonstrate that considerable molecular and electrophysiologic heterogeneity exists among the DA neurons within the SNpc as well as those within the VTA, adding yet another layer of complexity to the selective DA vulnerability observed in PD. The discovery of key pathways that regulate this differential susceptibility of DA neurons to degeneration holds great potential for the discovery of novel drug targets and the development of promising neuroprotective treatment strategies. This review provides an update on the molecular basis of the differential vulnerability of midbrain DA neurons in PD and highlights the most recent developments in this field.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by loss in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and is ranked as the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Dopamine receptor D3 is considered as a potential target in drug development against PD because of its lesser side effects and higher degree of neuro-protection. One of the prominent therapies currently available for PD is the use of dopamine agonists which mimic the natural action of dopamine in the brain and stimulate dopamine receptors directly. Unfortunately, use of these pharmacological therapies such as bromocriptine, apomorphine, and ropinirole provides only temporary relief of the disease symptoms and is frequently linked with insomnia, anxiety, depression, and agitation. Thus, there is a need for an alternative treatment that not only hinders neurodegeneration, but also has few or no side effects. Since the past decade, much attention has been given to exploitation of phytochemicals and their use in alternative medicine research. This is because plants are a cheap, indispensable, and never ending resource of active compounds that are beneficial against various diseases. In the current study, 40 active phytochemicals against PD were selected through literature survey. These ligands were docked with dopamine receptor D3 using AutoDock and AutoDockVina. Binding energies were compared to docking results of drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration against PD. The compounds were further analyzed for their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion-toxicity profile. From the study it is concluded that glycyrrhetinic acid and E.resveratroloside are potent compounds having high binding energies which should be considered as potential lead compounds for drug development against PD.",

    "abstract": "Impulse Control Disorders (ICDs) are a set of behaviours characterised by impulsivity despite known harm. Related to ICDs is the dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), which is characterised by an addiction-like consumption of dopaminergic medication and punding. These behaviours all have an increased prevalence in Parkinson\u05f3s disease (PD). The aim of this review is to identify treatments available for patients suffering from ICDs, DDS and punding in PD. Searches of The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Embase, Medline and PsychInfo were conducted, using the entire timescale available. Seven out of the 688 papers retrieved met the inclusion criteria and were considered in this systematic review. One class I study, one class II study, and five class IV studies were identified. All studies demonstrated a positive effect on ICDs in PD. Research in this field is still in its early stages. At present, there is insufficient evidence to recommend any treatment over another. There is a need for more methodologically robust research, using larger, more generalisable samples, randomisation and meaningful follow-up periods. In addition, the use of a validated outcome measures should be implemented in future research efforts.",

    "abstract": "Some studies have suggested that chronic Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection can aggravate the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson's disease (PD), and targeted intervention could potentially modify the course of this disabling disease. We aimed to study the impact of HP infection on motor function, gastrointestinal symptoms, and quality of life in a large cohort of PD patients.\n102 consecutive PD patients underwent (13)C urea breath testing and blinded evaluations consisting of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) including \"On\"-medication motor examination (Part III), objective and quantitative measures of bradykinesia (Purdue Pegboard and timed gait), Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire, and PDQ-39 (a health-related quality of life questionnaire).\n32.4% of PD patients were HP-positive. HP-positive patients were older (68.4 \u00b1 7.3 vs. 63.8 \u00b1 8.6 years, P = 0.009) and had worse motor function (UPDRS Part III 34.0 \u00b1 13.0 vs. 27.3 \u00b1 10.0, P = 0.04; Pegboard 6.4 \u00b1 3.3 vs. 8.0 \u00b1 2.7 pins, P = 0.04; and timed gait 25.1 \u00b1 25.4 vs. 15.5 \u00b1 7.6 s, P = 0.08). In the multivariate analysis, HP status demonstrated significant main effects on UPDRS Part III and timed gait. The association between HP status and these motor outcomes varied according to age. Gastrointestinal symptoms and PDQ-39 Summary Index scores did not differ between the two groups.\nThis is the largest cross-sectional study to demonstrate an association between HP positivity and worse PD motor severity.",

    "abstract": "A recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) has identified the rs12456492 variant in RIT2 as a new susceptibility loci. Because the characteristics of this locus in a Han Chinese population from mainland China was still unknown, we performed a case-control replication study in this population and investigated RIT2 rs12456492 variant in a large cohort of Chinese Han individuals. In total, 933 subjects comprising 460 PD patients and 473 control subjects were genotyped. We found a significant difference in the distributions of genotype and allele between PD and control groups (genotype p = 0.008, allele p = 0.007, odds ratio = 1.296, 95% confidence interval = 1.075-1.563). This study replicates the association between rs12456492 variant and risk of developing PD in a Han Chinese population.",

Insulin signaling in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease is impaired. Preclinical studies of growth factors showed impressive neuroprotective effects. In animal models of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, insulin, glia-derived neurotrophic factor, or analogues of the incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 prevented neurodegenerative processes and improved neuronal and synaptic functionality in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. On the basis of these promising findings, several clinical trials are ongoing with the first encouraging clinical results published.

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and have a major impact on wellbeing. They nevertheless receive limited scientific attention. This study aimed to establish the symptom dimensions of anxiety in PD, and their relationship with depression, autonomic failure and motor symptoms.\nIn this cross-sectional observational study, symptoms of anxiety were measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) in 294 PD patients. Symptom dimensions of anxiety in PD were explored through principal component analysis (PCA) of BAI items. The relationship between anxiety and depressive, autonomic and motor symptoms was assessed through PCA and regression analyses.\nClinically relevant symptoms of anxiety were present in 45% of patients. PCA of the BAI resulted in five subscales, corresponding to a single affective and four somatic symptom dimensions (thermoregulation, hypotension, hyperventilation and trembling) of anxiety. Symptoms of anxiety and depression displayed a large overlap. All somatic BAI subscales were significantly influenced by motor and autonomic symptoms, while the affective subscale was not.\nAnxiety in PD comprises affective and somatic symptom dimensions. The affective subscale of the BAI is not influenced by motor or autonomic symptoms, and may therefore prove useful for future research. Scores on the somatic subscales of the BAI were associated with autonomic failure and motor impairment, demonstrating a strong interplay between motor and non-motor symptoms in PD. These results stress the importance of a holistic approach of anxiety in PD.",

    "abstract": "To investigate if community-based Irish set dancing is feasible in Irish adults with Parkinson's disease.\nOver an eight week period, ten participants attended one set dancing class per week and completed a home programme in parallel. Feasibility was assessed by monitoring adverse effects, participants' verbal feedback, compliance rates and feedback from an exit questionnaire. Participants were assessed using the Berg balance scale, 6-min walk test, UPDRS-3 and PDQ-39, before and after the intervention.\nNo adverse effects were detected. Attendance at classes was 86%. Compliance with the home programme was 67%. Findings from the exit questionnaire showed participants enjoyed participating and reported improvements in aspects of health including balance. Quality of life improved with the dance programme and there was a trend toward improvement on the UPDRS-3.\nThese findings suggest community-based Irish set dancing is a feasible form of exercise that can positively influence quality of life.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine whether the prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) continues to rise after 80 years of age.\nThis is a two-stage, multi-center, cross-sectional study using a stratified cluster sampling approach was employed. Subjects included veterans at \u2265 60 years of age living in veterans' communities for at least one month in 18 major cities across China. In the first step, possible PD was screened using a PD screening scale. Demographic and relevant information were collected. In the second step, PD diagnosis was established using the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank (UKPDSBB) diagnostic criteria.\nThe study was conducted during the period from December 2009 to December 2012. The study included 277 veterans' communities. Among the approached 11,593 subjects, 9676 subjects, (9096 men, 580 women) responded. The response rate was 83.46%.The age was \u2265 80 years in 6722 (69.47%) subjects. A diagnosis of PD was established in 228 subjects (2.36%) in the entire sample. The rate of PD was 2.65% in those with an age of \u2265 80 years. The rate of PD increased with increasing age (0%, 1.84%, 2.60% and 3.68% in the subjects at < 70, 70-79, 80-89 and \u2265 90 years of age, respectively; \u03c72 = 10.891, p = 0.001 in chi-square test). The rate of PD was higher in men (2.44%) than in women (1.46%) on the surface. However, no significant difference was detected (p = 0.241).\nThe prevalence of PD continues to increase beyond the age of 80 years. The prevalence of PD in Chinese veterans is not lower than that in other countries and regions.",

    "abstract": "Globally, there is a continuous rise in the older population (over 65 years), particularly in developed countries. As many diseases are age-related, older adults represent a highly heterogeneous cohort. This presents a major challenge for both the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare professionals. The purpose of this research was to attract attention towards the appropriateness of geriatric formulations by investigating the dosage form attributes of currently UK licensed cardiovascular and Parkinson's disease drug products. Medication available in the UK for cardiovascular disorders and Parkinson's disease were screened and the available formulations, packaging and patient information leaflets of these medicines were analysed, with the goal of raising awareness of the need to cater for elderly patients with increasing difficulty in managing their medication. It emerged that although cardiovascular disorders and Parkinson's disease are more prevalent in older people, many treatment options have not been optimised for this cohort. In particular, older patient centred dosage forms, specific dosing requirements, excipients, patient-friendly packaging and easy-to-follow patient information were highlighted as areas to be considered in order to optimise health outcomes in the ageing population.",

    "abstract": "Considering the functional organization of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), we hypothesized that subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in Parkinson's disease might have a differential impact on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in relation to the position of active stimulating contact within the STN. In addition, we searched for any STN-DBS-related morning plasma cortisol changes in association with postoperative anxiety and weight gain. A plasma cortisol measurement was performed on the day of initiation of bilateral STN-DBS and repeated after 1 and 17 months in twenty patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. The body weight change and anxiety scores following the implantation were assessed as well. The electrode positions in the STN were determined on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. After initiation of stimulation, cortisol levels significantly decreased and the cortisol changes after 1 and 17 months strongly correlated with the position of active contact in the subthalamic area. Patients with at least one contact located more medially in the STN experienced a significantly greater decrease of cortisol than those with one or both active contacts more laterally. Furthermore, the lower cortisol levels were strongly associated with higher trait anxiety and weight gain. These changes mimicked the effects of chronic stress and suggest the disturbing impact of STN-DBS on limbic and motivational systems.",

    "abstract": "The myelin-associated protein Nogo-A is among the most potent neurite growth inhibitors in the adult CNS. Recently, Nogo-A expression was demonstrated in a number of neuronal subpopulations of the adult and developing CNS but at present, little is known about the expression of Nogo-A in the nigrostriatal system, a brain structure severely affected in Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study sought to characterize the expression pattern of Nogo-A immunoreactive (ir) cells in the adult ventral mesencephalon of control rats and in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of PD. Immunohistochemical analyses of normal adult rat brain showed a distinct expression of Nogo-A in the ventral mesencephalon, with the highest level in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) where it co-localized with dopaminergic neurons. Analyses conducted 1week and 1 month after unilateral striatal injections of 6-OHDA disclosed a severe loss of the number of Nogo-A-ir cells in the SNc. Notably, at 1week after treatment, more dopaminergic neurons expressing Nogo-A were affected by the 6-OHDA toxicity than Nogo-A-negative dopaminergic neurons. However, at later time points more of the surviving dopaminergic neurons expressed Nogo-A. In the striatum, both small and large Nogo-A-positive cells were detected. The large cells were identified as cholinergic interneurons. Our results suggest yet unidentified functions of Nogo-A in the CNS beyond the inhibition of axonal regeneration and plasticity, and may indicate a role for Nogo-A in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disease, but its pathogenesis is not fully understood. The selective neuronal cell death in PD has been considered to result from a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors, but the nature of the relationship between the two chief modifiers remains to be elucidated. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the role of epigenetics in the development and progression of many neurodegenerative diseases including PD. Epigenetic modification refers to changes in gene expression or function without changes in DNA sequence, which mainly includes DNA methylation, post-modifications of histone, and non-coding RNAs. In this review, we will focus on the abnormal epigenetic modifications involved in the pathogenesis of PD and their implications for the development of future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disease that can be caused by genetic mutations in \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) or duplication of wild-type \u03b1-syn; PD is characterized by the deposition of \u03b1-syn aggregates, indicating a gain of toxicity from accumulation of \u03b1-syn. Although the major neuropathologic feature of PD is the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra, non-motor symptoms including anxiety, cognitive defect and sleep disorder precede the onset of motor impairment, and many clinical symptoms of PD are not caused by degeneration of DA neurons. Non-human primate models of PD are important for revealing the early pathology in PD and identifying effective treatments. We established transgenic PD rhesus monkeys that express mutant \u03b1-syn (A53T). Six transgenic A53T monkeys were produced via lentiviral vector expressing A53T in fertilized monkey eggs and subsequent embryo transfer to surrogates. Transgenic A53T is expressed in the monkey brain and causes age-dependent non-motor symptoms, including cognitive defects and anxiety phenotype, without detectable sleeping disorders. The transgenic \u03b1-syn monkeys demonstrate the specific early symptoms caused by mutant \u03b1-syn and provide insight into treatment of early PD.",

    "abstract": "Exercise has been shown to improve clinical measures of strength, balance and mobility, and in some cases, has improved symptoms of tremor and rigidity in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, to date, no research has examined whether improvements in trunk control can remedy deficits in dynamic postural stability in this population. The proposed randomised controlled trial aims to establish whether a 12-week exercise programme aimed at improving dynamic postural stability in people with PD; (1) is more effective than education; (2) is more effective when training frequency is increased; and (3) provides greater long-term benefits than education.\nForty-five community-dwelling individuals diagnosed with idiopathic PD with a falls history will be recruited. Participants will complete baseline assessments including tests of cognition, vision, disease severity, fear of falling, mobility and quality of life. Additionally, participants will complete a series of standing balance tasks to evaluate static postural stability, while dynamic postural control will be measured during walking using head and trunk-mounted three-dimensional accelerometers. Following baseline testing, participants will be randomly-assigned to one of three intervention groups, who will receive either exercise once per week, exercise 3 days/week, or education. Participants will repeat the same battery of tests conducted at baseline after the 12-week intervention and again following a further 12-week sustainability period.\nThis study has the potential to show that low-intensity and progressive trunk exercises can provide a non-invasive and effective means for maintaining or improving postural stability for people with PD. Importantly, if the programme is noted to be effective, it could be easily performed by patients within their home environment or under the guidance of available allied health professionals.\nThe protocol for this study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12613001175763).",

    "abstract": "To determine whether falls can be prevented with minimally supervised exercise targeting potentially remediable fall risk factors, i.e., poor balance, reduced leg muscle strength, and freezing of gait, in people with Parkinson disease.\nTwo hundred thirty-one people with Parkinson disease were randomized into exercise or usual-care control groups. Exercises were practiced for 40 to 60 minutes, 3 times weekly for 6 months. Primary outcomes were fall rates and proportion of fallers during the intervention period. Secondary outcomes were physical (balance, mobility, freezing of gait, habitual physical activity), psychological (fear of falling, affect), and quality-of-life measures.\nThere was no significant difference between groups in the rate of falls (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45-1.17, p = 0.18) or proportion of fallers (p = 0.45). Preplanned subgroup analysis revealed a significant interaction for disease severity (p < 0.001). In the lower disease severity subgroup, there were fewer falls in the exercise group compared with controls (IRR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.15-0.62, p < 0.001), while in the higher disease severity subgroup, there was a trend toward more falls in the exercise group (IRR = 1.61, 95% CI 0.86-3.03, p = 0.13). Postintervention, the exercise group scored significantly (p < 0.05) better than controls on the Short Physical Performance Battery, sit-to-stand, fear of falling, affect, and quality of life, after adjusting for baseline performance.\nAn exercise program targeting balance, leg strength, and freezing of gait did not reduce falls but improved physical and psychological health. Falls were reduced in people with milder disease but not in those with more severe Parkinson disease.\nThis study provides Class III evidence that for patients with Parkinson disease, a minimally supervised exercise program does not reduce fall risk. This study lacked the precision to exclude a moderate reduction or modest increase in fall risk from exercise.\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12608000303347).",

    "abstract": "Learning and motivation are intrinsically related, and both have been linked to dopamine. Parkinson's disease results from a progressive loss of dopaminergic inputs to the striatum and leads to impairments in motivation and learning from feedback. However, the link between motivation and learning in Parkinson's disease is not well understood. To address this gap, we leverage a well-established psychological theory of motivation, regulatory mode theory, which distinguishes between two functionally independent motivational concerns in regulating behavior: a concern with having an effect by initiating and maintaining movement (Locomotion) and a concern with establishing what is correct by critically evaluating goal pursuit means and outcomes (Assessment). We examined Locomotion and Assessment in patients with Parkinson's disease and age-matched controls. Parkinson's disease patients demonstrated a selective decrease in Assessment motivation but no change in Locomotion motivation, suggesting that Parkinson's disease leads to a reduced tendency to evaluate and monitor outcomes. Moreover, weaker Assessment motivation was correlated with poorer performance on a feedback-based learning task previously shown to depend on the striatum. Together, these findings link a questionnaire-based personality inventory with performance on a well-characterized experimental task, advancing our understanding of how Parkinson's disease affects motivation with implications for well-being and treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Its diagnosis relies solely on a clinical examination and is not straightforward because no diagnostic test exists. Large, population-based, prospective cohort studies designed to examine other outcomes that are more common than PD might provide cost-efficient alternatives for studying the disease. However, most cohort studies have not implemented rigorous systematic screening for PD. A majority of epidemiologic studies that utilize population-based prospective designs rely on secondary data sources to identify PD cases. Direct validation of these secondary sources against clinical diagnostic criteria is lacking. The Framingham Heart Study has prospectively screened and evaluated participants for PD based on clinical diagnostic criteria. We assessed the predictive value of secondary sources for PD identification relative to clinical diagnostic criteria in the Framingham Heart Study (2001-2012). We found positive predictive values of 1.0 (95% confidence interval: 0.868, 1.0), 1.0 (95% confidence interval: 0.839, 1.0), and 0.50 (95% confidence interval: 0.307, 0.694) for PD identified from self-report, use of antiparkinsonian medications, and Medicare claims, respectively. The negative predictive values were all higher than 0.99. Our results highlight the limitations of using only Medicare claims data and suggest that population-based cohorts may be utilized for the study of PD determined via self-report or medication inventories while preserving a high degree of confidence in the validity of PD case identification.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) displays an individually variable rate of progression, of which the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, but may involve genetic factors. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of ethnic origin on PD progression rate in Israeli Jews, as expressed by time from onset until reaching Hoehn and Yahr stage 3 (HY3).\nConsecutive patients with PD followed bi-annually at the Movement Disorders Institute at Sheba Medical Center, were included. Demographic data and clinical information, including age at PD onset (AO), H&Y staging, and family history of PD, were collected. Ethnicity was determined based on the parents' origin and was categorized as Ashkenazi Jews (AJ), Yemenite Jews (YJ), North African Jews (NAJ) and Oriental Jews (OJ) excluding YJ. Associations between the above variables and the time to HY3 were determined using Cox proportional hazards model. Survival curves were derived from the model.\nOf 707 patients [430 males, AJ: 458, YJ: 37, NAJ: 75 and OJ: 137] included in the analysis, 343 had reached HY3. In a multivariate analysis, a longer time to HY3 was significantly associated with a younger AO (HR = 1.07, p < 0.001). YJ showed a significantly shorter time to HY3 compared to AJ and OJ, but not compared to NAJ. Time to HY3 was significantly shorter for NAJ than for OJ.\nJewish PD patients of Yemenite and North African origin may have a more rapid progression of PD, compared to those of Ashkenazi and Oriental origin, suggesting distinctive genetic influences.",

    "abstract": "Adapted tango dancing improves mobility and balance in older adults and additional populations with balance impairments. It is composed of very simple step elements. Adapted tango involves movement initiation and cessation, multi-directional perturbations, varied speeds and rhythms. Focus on foot placement, whole body coordination, and attention to partner, path of movement, and aesthetics likely underlie adapted tango's demonstrated efficacy for improving mobility and balance. In this paper, we describe the methodology to disseminate the adapted tango teaching methods to dance instructor trainees and to implement the adapted tango by the trainees in the community for older adults and individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Efficacy in improving mobility (measured with the Timed Up and Go, Tandem stance, Berg Balance Scale, Gait Speed and 30 sec chair stand), safety and fidelity of the program is maximized through targeted instructor and volunteer training and a structured detailed syllabus outlining class practices and progression.",

    "abstract": "The clinical diagnostic criteria of Parkinson's disease (PD) have limitations in detecting the disease at early stage and in differentiating heterogeneous clinical progression. The lack of reliable biomarker(s) for early diagnosis and prediction of prognosis is a major hurdle to achieve optimal clinical care of patients and efficient design of clinical trials for disease-modifying therapeutics. Numerous efforts to discover PD biomarkers in CSF were conducted. In this review, we describe the molecular pathogenesis of PD and discuss its implication to develop PD biomarkers in CSF. Next, we summarize the clinical utility of CSF biomarkers including alpha-synuclein for early and differential diagnosis, and prediction of PD progression. Given the heterogeneity in the clinical features of PD and none of the CSF biomarkers for an early diagnosis have been developed, research efforts to develop biomarkers to predict heterogeneous disease progression is on-going. Notably, a rapid cognitive decline followed by the development of dementia is a risk factor of poor prognosis in PD. In connection to this, CSF levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers have received considerable attention. However, we still need long-term longitudinal observational studies employing large cohorts to evaluate the clinical utility of CSF biomarkers reflecting Lewy body pathology and AD pathology in the brain. We believe that current research efforts including the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative will resolve the current needs of early diagnosis and/or prediction of disease progression using CSF biomarkers, and which will further accelerate the development of disease-modifying therapeutics and optimize the clinical management of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are small organelles that produce the majority of cellular energy as ATP. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), and rare familial forms of PD provide valuable insight into the pathogenic mechanism underlying mitochondrial impairment, even though the majority of PD cases are sporadic. The regulation of mitochondria is crucial for the maintenance of energy-demanding neuronal functions in the brain. Mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagic degradation are the major regulatory pathways that preserve optimal mitochondrial content, structure and function. In this mini-review, we provide an overview of the mitochondrial quality control mechanisms, emphasizing regulatory molecules in mitophagy and biogenesis that specifically interact with the protein products of three major recessive familial PD genes, PINK1, Parkin and DJ-1.",

    "abstract": "Mutations causing genetic disorders can occur during mitotic cell division after fertilization, which is called somatic mutations. This leads to somatic mosaicism, where two or more genetically distinct cells are present in one individual. Somatic mutations are the most well studied in cancer where it plays an important role and also have been associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. The study of somatic mosaicism in Parkinson disease (PD) is only in its infancy, and a case with somatic mutation has not yet been described. However, we can speculate that a somatic mutation affecting cells in the central nervous system including substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons could lead to the development of PD through the same pathomechanisms of genetic PD even in the absence of a germ-line mutation. Theoretically, a number of genes could be candidates for genetic analysis for the presence of somatic mosaicism. Among them, SNCA and PARK2 could be the best candidates to analyze. Because analyzing brain tissues in living patients is impossible, alternative tissues could be used to indicate the genetic status of the brain. Performance of the technology is another factor to consider when analyzing the tissues.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies report a 60-70% reduced risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in smokers as compared to non-smokers. However, relationships between former smoking and PD have been poorly investigated.\nWe recruited 116 de novo PD subjects, and investigated current, former and never smoking, and reasons for smoking cessation among former smokers. Two hundred and thirty-two controls were matched by Propensity Score.\nPD subjects and controls were found to be current smokers (7.7 vs. 39.6%), former smokers (43.9 vs. 6.5%) and never smokers (48.2 vs. 53.9%). Logistic regression showed that current smokers were less likely to have PD (p < 0.001; OR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.10-0.46), while former smokers were more likely to have PD (p < 0.001; OR: 7.6; 95% CI: 4.09-15.75), as compared to never smokers. Fifty-one PD patients reported quitting smoking before PD diagnosis (mean time since cessation 9.4 \u00b1 7.3 years). Most important reasons to quit smoking in PD group were illness different from PD (26 subjects, 51.0%), knowledge of the harmful effects of smoking (24 subjects, 47.0%), and physician's advice (1 subject, 2.0%).\nThe reduced prevalence of current smokers among PD subjects as compared to healthy controls is consistent with previous findings, suggesting a possible neuroprotective effect of smoking. However, it could be due, at least in part, to the increased prevalence of former smokers among PD patients, that were more prone to quit smoking as compared to healthy controls. We suggest that smoking cessation could be an early preclinical condition occurring in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by motor deficits as well as cognitive alterations, particularly concerning frontal lobe control. Here, we were interested in whether executive function is abnormal already early in PD, as well as whether this dysfunction worsens as a part of the dementia in PD. The following groups engaged in tasks addressing action control: PD patients with mild and advanced motor symptoms (aPD) without dementia, PD patients with dementia (PDD), patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy subjects (CON). Subjects either had to perform or inhibit button presses upon go and no-go cues, respectively. These cues were preceded by pre-cues, either randomly instructive of right or left hand preparation (switch condition), or repetitively instructive for one side only (non-switch condition). PDD and aPD omitted more go responses than CON. Furthermore, PDD disproportionally committed failures upon no-go cues compared to CON. In the non-switch condition, PDD performed worse than AD, whose deficits increased to the level of PDD in the switch condition. Over all PD patients, task performance correlated with disease severity. Under the switch condition, task performance was low in both PDD and AD. In the non-switch condition, this also held true for advanced PD patients (with and without dementia), but not for AD. Thus, the deficits evident in PDD appear to develop from imbalanced inhibitory-to-excitatory action control generally inherent to PD. These results specify the concept of dysexecution in PD and differentiate the cognitive profile of PDD from that of AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) receptors play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the role of GABA-B receptor modulation in experimental models of MPTP-induced PD. MPTP was administered repeatedly on 1st, 7th and 14th day intranigrally for the induction of PD in Male Wistar rats. Baclofen (10 and 20mg/kg) and GABA-B antagonist CGP35348 (10mg/kg) were given after induction of PD for 14 days. Different behavioural tasks were performed during 1st, 14th, 21st, 28th days after MPTP injection and biochemical parameters were estimated on day 28th. Central administration of MPTP showed significant impairment of motor behaviour and marked increase of oxidative damage LPO and GSH in striatum and cortex. Pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1 and IL-\u03b2 were significantly increased in striatum region of MPTP treated rats. However, post treatment with baclofen significantly improved the motor abnormalities and attenuated the oxidative damage and neuro-inflammation in MPTP treated rats. CGP35348, GABA-B receptor antagonist, reversed the protective effect of baclofen GABA-B receptor play role in the neuroprotection. The present study concluded that baclofen produce beneficial effect against MPTP induced PD like symptoms rats through GABAergic mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The Parkinson Anxiety Scale is a new scale developed to measure anxiety severity in Parkinson's disease specifically. It consists of three dimensions: persistent anxiety, episodic anxiety, and avoidance behavior. This study aimed to assess the measurement properties of the scale while controlling for the rater (self- vs. clinician-rated) effect. The Parkinson Anxiety Scale was administered to a cross-sectional multicenter international sample of 362 Parkinson's disease patients. Both patients and clinicians rated the patient's anxiety independently. A many-facet Rasch model design was applied to estimate and remove the rater effect. The following measurement properties were assessed: fit to the Rasch model, unidimensionality, reliability, differential item functioning, item local independency, interrater reliability (self or clinician), and scale targeting. In addition, test-retest stability, construct validity, precision, and diagnostic properties of the Parkinson Anxiety Scale were also analyzed. A good fit to the Rasch model was obtained for Parkinson Anxiety Scale dimensions A and B, after the removal of one item and rescoring of the response scale for certain items, whereas dimension C showed marginal fit. Self versus clinician rating differences were of small magnitude, with patients reporting higher anxiety levels than clinicians. The linear measure for Parkinson Anxiety Scale dimensions A and B showed good convergent construct with other anxiety measures and good diagnostic properties. Parkinson Anxiety Scale modified dimensions A and B provide valid and reliable measures of anxiety in Parkinson's disease that are comparable across raters. Further studies are needed with dimension C.",

    "abstract": "Gait impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) persists despite the use of dopaminergic therapy. Motor phenotype associated with greater postural instability and gait difficulty is related to a greater risk of motor decline and may be influenced by non-dopaminergic pathology. This study documents the progression of gait impairment over 18 months in an incident cohort of PD with regard to phenotype and medication. Gait characteristics were measured in 121 PD and 184 controls, and 18 months later in 108 PD participants. Sixteen gait characteristics were examined with respect to five broad domains for PD and motor phenotype. Correlations between change in levodopa (l-dopa) equivalent daily dose and gait were used to identify dopa-responsive and nonresponsive characteristics. Pace and rhythm deteriorated over 18 months in people with PD, with other gait domains remaining stable. People with a postural instability and gait difficulty phenotype had more impaired gait at baseline compared with a tremor-dominant phenotype, which was most evident in temporal characteristics. In contrast, pace and variability deteriorated over the subsequent 18 months in the tremor-dominant phenotype only. Weak but statistically significant correlations were found between increased l-dopa medication and less deterioration in pace and asymmetry. Significant gait impairment is evident in very early disease despite optimal medication. Change over 18 months is subtle and discrete, and is more pronounced in the tremor-dominant phenotype. Some features of gait are refractory to dopaminergic therapy, implicating a non-dopaminergic contribution. This may explain more temporal gait disturbance in the postural instability and gait difficulty phenotype.",

    "abstract": "There have been limited comparative data regarding the investigations on pulmonary and respiratory muscle function in the patients with different parkinsonism disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) versus normal elderly. The present study is aiming to characterize the performance of pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength in PD and MSA, and to investigate the association with severity of motor symptoms and disease duration.\nPulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength tests were performed in 30 patients with PD, 27 with MSA as well as in 20 age-, sex-, height-, weight-matched normal elderly controls. All the patients underwent United Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) or united multiple system atrophy rating scale (UMSARS) separately as diagnosed.\nVital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity decreased, residual volume and ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity increased in both PD and MSA groups compared to controls (p<0.05). Diffusing capacity was decreased in the MSA group, compared with PD and normal elderly control groups (p<0.05). Respiratory muscle strength was lower in both PD and MSA groups than in controls (p<0.05). The values representing spirometry function and respiratory muscle strength were found to have a negative linear correlation with mean score of UPDRS-III in PD and mean score of UMSARS-I in MSA. Respiratory muscle strength showed a negative linear correlation with the mean score of UMSARS-II and disease duration in MSA patients.\nThese findings suggest that respiratory dysfunction is involved in PD and MSA. Respiratory muscle strength is remarkably reduced, and some of the parameters correlate with disease duration and illness severity. The compromised respiratory function in neurodegenerative disorders should be the focus of further researches.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to evaluate whether the predominant motor distribution pattern (ie, symmetric or asymmetric) observed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) contributes independently to disease severity and progression. We further examine whether this pattern is stable over time, and whether a potential change in pattern affects the course of the disease. We used data from the longitudinal PROPARK study (N\u2009>\u2009400) to examine the association of the predominant motor distribution pattern with motor, cognitive, depressive, psychotic, and autonomic symptoms, and with excessive daytime sleepiness. We found that a symmetrical distribution of motor features was associated with poorer performance on nearly all domains, but that this was entirely explained by confounding, in particular by higher age and longer disease duration. We also found that greater asymmetry was associated with younger age, younger age at onset, and shorter disease duration. We further observed a clear tendency to develop a more symmetric distribution pattern as the disease advanced. Conversion to a symmetric pattern was associated with more severe disease, but this conversion did not contribute independently to the less favorable disease course. With increasing age and disease duration comes a clear tendency to develop a more symmetric distribution of motor features in PD. Although this change in distribution pattern is associated with more severe disease as compared with nonconvertors, this pattern change did not contribute independently to the less favorable course. We discuss these findings in light of the evidence from the literature.",

    "abstract": "The prerequisite for an earlier diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) are markers that are both sensitive and specific for clinically definite PD and its prediagnosic phases. Promising candidates include enlarged hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra (SN+) on transcranial sonography (TCS) and hyposmia. However, despite good sensitivity and specificity, both markers have yet failed to yield reliable predictions. We pursue the possibility of combined use in an ongoing population-based cohort. Subjects were recruited from 10,000 inhabitants of Luebeck/Germany aged 50 to 79 years and additional PD patients from our outpatient clinic. After neurological examination, 715 subjects were grouped into clinically definite PD (n\u2009=\u2009106), possible prediagnostic PD (ppPD; n\u2009=\u200973), and a control group subdivided into healthy individuals (n\u2009=\u2009283) and controls with diseases other than PD (n\u2009=\u2009253). Subjects underwent TCS and smell testing. Sensitivity and specificity of SN+ and hyposmia were good for PD; however, positive predictive values (PPV) of both SN+ (5.2%) and olfaction (2.5%) were low. At least one positive/both positive markers were present in 33%/1% of healthy controls, 33%/2% of diseased controls, 62%/7% of ppPD, and 94%/51% of PD. When combining SN+ and hyposmia, PPV increased to 17.6%, with a sensitivity of 51% and a specificity of 98%. Both SN+ and hyposmia offer good enrichment towards PD and ppPD, are stable against other diseases, and the combination of markers highly increases specificity. However, if the combination of SN+ and hyposmia were used as criterion for PD diagnosis, almost half of clinically definite PD and more than 90% of ppPD would have been missed.",

    "abstract": "Depressive symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the pathophysiology and neural basis underlying depression in PD is not well understood. Abnormal functional connectivity of the amygdala with various cortical and subcortical areas has been observed in major depressive disorder, indicating that dysfunction of the corticolimbic network may be involved in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder. However, little is known about alterations of amygdala functional connectivity in depressed PD patients. In the present study, 20 depressed PD patients, 40 nondepressed PD patients, and 43 matched healthy controls underwent neuropsychological tests and resting-state functional MRI scanning. Between-group differences in amygdala functional connectivity network were examined using t tests. Compared to the nondepressed PD patients, depressed PD patients showed increased left amygdala functional connectivity with the bilateral mediodorsal thalamus, right amygdala functional connectivity with the left superior temporal gyrus, and left calcarine gyrus. Compared to the healthy controls, the depressed PD group also showed increased left amygdala functional connectivity with the bilateral mediodorsal thalamus, but decreased left amygdala functional connectivity with the left putamen, left inferior frontal gyrus, and the right cerebellum, as well as decreased right amygdala functional connectivity with the left inferior orbitofrontal gyrus, the left gyrus rectus, and the right putamen. The increased connectivity between limbic regions and decreased connectivity between the corticolimbic networks may reflect impaired high-order cortical regulatory effects on the emotion-related limbic areas, which may lead to mood dysregulation. Our study should advance the understanding of neural mechanisms underlying depression in PD.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated association between SNCA variability and susceptibility to Parkinson's disease, but causal mechanisms are unclear. We hypothesized that risk variants affect methylation of a putative promoter in SNCA intron 1, previously highlighted in epigenetic studies of Parkinson's disease.\nWe analyzed sample sets from blood (n\u2009=\u200972) and cerebral cortex (n\u2009=\u200924) in Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls. We genotyped SNCA single-nucleotide polymorphisms, examined messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and assessed intron 1 methylation levels by methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nPatients showed significant hypomethylation as compared with controls in the blood sample set. In addition, rs3756063 was associated with SNCA methylation level in both blood (P = 5.9 \u00d7 10(-5)) and brain (P\u2009=\u20090.023).\nOur findings support a link between SNCA variability, promoter methylation, and Parkinson's disease risk and indicate that methylation patterns in brain are mirrored in the blood. SNCA methylation warrants further investigation as a potential biomarker.",

    "abstract": "There is compelling evidence from over 60 epidemiological studies that smoking significantly reduces the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). In general, those who currently smoke cigarettes, as well as those with a past history of such smoking, have a reduced risk of PD compared to those who have never smoked. Recently it has been suggested that a cardinal nonmotor sensory symptom of PD, olfactory dysfunction, may be less severe in PD patients who smoke than in PD patients who do not, in contrast to the negative effect of smoking on olfaction described in the general population.\nWe evaluated University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) scores from 323 PD patients and 323 controls closely matched individually on age, sex, and smoking history (never, past, or current).\nPatients exhibited much lower UPSIT scores than did the controls (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). The relative decline in dysfunction of the current PD smokers was less than that of the never- and past-PD smokers (respective Ps\u2009=\u20090.0005 and 0.0019). Female PD patients outperformed their male counterparts by a larger margin than did the female controls (3.66 vs. 1.07 UPSIT points; respective Ps\u2009<\u20090.0001 and 0.06). Age-related declines in UPSIT scores were generally present (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). No association between the olfactory measure and smoking dose, as indexed by pack-years, was evident.\nPD patients who currently smoke do not exhibit the smoking-related decline in olfaction observed in non-PD control subjects who currently smoke. The physiological basis of this phenomenon is yet to be defined.",

    "abstract": "Motor complications in Parkinson's disease (PD) are associated with long-term oral levodopa treatment and linked to pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation. L-dopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is delivered continuously by percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy tube (PEG-J), which reduces L-dopa-plasma-level fluctuations and can translate to reduced motor complications. We present final results of the largest international, prospective, 54-week, open-label LCIG study. PD patients with severe motor fluctuations (>3 h/day \"off\" time) despite optimized therapy received LCIG monotherapy. Additional PD medications were allowed >28 days post-LCIG initiation. Safety was the primary endpoint measured through adverse events (AEs), device complications, and number of completers. Secondary endpoints included diary-assessed off time, \"on\" time with/without troublesome dyskinesia, UPDRS, and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) outcomes. Of 354 enrolled patients, 324 (91.5%) received PEG-J and 272 (76.8%) completed the study. Most AEs were mild/moderate and transient; complication of device insertion (34.9%) was the most common. Twenty-seven (7.6%) patients withdrew because of AEs. Serious AEs occurred in 105 (32.4%), most commonly complication of device insertion (6.5%). Mean daily off time decreased by 4.4 h/65.6% (P\u2009<\u20090.001). On time without troublesome dyskinesia increased by 4.8 h/62.9% (P\u2009<\u20090.001); on time with troublesome dyskinesia decreased by 0.4 h/22.5% (P\u2009=\u20090.023). Improvements persisted from week 4 through study completion. UPDRS and HRQoL outcomes were also improved throughout. In the advanced PD population, LCIG's safety profile consisted primarily of AEs associated with the device/procedure, l-dopa/carbidopa, and advanced PD. LCIG was generally well tolerated and demonstrated clinically significant improvements in motor function, daily activities, and HRQoL sustained over 54 weeks.",

    "abstract": "An inverse association between Parkinson disease (PD) and total vitamin D levels has been reported, but whether vitamin D from different sources, that is, 25(OH)D2 (from diet and supplements) and 25(OH)D3 (mainly from sunlight exposure), all contribute to the association is unknown. Plasma total 25(OH)D, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 levels were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in PD patients (n\u2009=\u2009478) and controls (n\u2009=\u2009431). Total 25(OH)D was categorized by clinical insufficiency or deficiency; 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 were analyzed in quartiles. Vitamin D deficiency (total 25[OH]D\u2009<\u200920 ng/mL) and vitamin D insufficiency (total 25[OH]D\u2009<\u200930 ng/mL) are associated with PD risk (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20092.6 [deficiency] and 2.1 [insufficiency]; P\u2009<\u20090.0001), adjusting for age, sex, and sampling season. Both 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels are inversely associated with PD (P(trend)\u2009<\u20090.0001). The association between 25(OH)D2 and PD risk is largely confined to individuals with low 25(OH)D3 levels (P(trend)\u2009=\u20090.0008 and 0.12 in individuals with 25[OH]D3\u2009<\u200920 ng/mL and 25[OH]D3\u2009\u2265\u200920 ng/mL, respectively). Our data confirm the association between vitamin D deficiency and PD, and for the first time demonstrate an inverse association of 25(OH)D2 with PD. Given that 25(OH)D2 concentration is independent of sunlight exposure, this new finding suggests that the inverse association between vitamin D levels and PD is not simply attributable to lack of sunlight exposure in PD patients with impaired mobility. The current study, however, cannot exclude the possibility that gastrointestinal dysfunction, a non-motor PD symptom, contributes to the lower vitamin D2 levels in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition often resulting in significant disability and impacting on one's ability to participate in an occupation. The present study aimed to explore how people with advanced Parkinson's disease experience the phenomenon of occupation in their daily lives in order to inform the practice of occupational therapy in palliative care.\nUsing a phenomenological approach, in-depth interviews were undertaken with a purposive sample of 10 people in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. These interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and subsequently analyzed using a thematic content analysis approach. The study received approval from the relevant university ethics committee, as well as the research network of Parkinson's UK.\nThe experience of occupation emerged as being physical, psychological, social, and spiritual with related subthemes. Within each of these themes, participants described their experience of occupation that they valued and that were important to their daily lives. They also identified the strategies they employed to continue participating in certain occupations and described others they were no longer able to engage in and the impact of that loss.\nParticipants' experiences crossed the domains of palliative care and suggest that adopting a palliative care approach would enhance an enhanced quality of life, experienced in terms of meaningful and valuable occupation. Disruption to participation in occupation caused them distress and frustration, suggesting that access to occupation-focused therapy would significantly improve quality of life for people with PD. As there is a strong link between the ethos of occupational therapy and palliative care, it is proposed that there is a valuable role for occupational therapy intervention to play within palliative care.",

    "abstract": "In late life, neurological disturbances, depression, and anxiety frequently complicate the clinical presentation but are often undertreated. An administrative database of 3,034 male veterans, age 55 years and older, with a diagnosis of dementia, Parkinson's disease, or stroke was examined for the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders and mental health service use. Those with more than one of these neurological diagnoses were most likely to have a comorbid depressive or anxiety disorder. The majority of patients with anxiety and depression were prescribed antidepressants. Mental health specialty visits were less frequent than medication treatment overall but most common for those with dementia only. These data suggest that specialty mental health care remains a significant unmet need for individuals with neurological disorders complicated by depression and anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests that microRNA (miR) dysregulation contributes to neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD). MiR-34b and miR-34c have been previously shown to be down-regulated in the brains of patients with PD. Here, we demonstrate that miR-34b and miR-34c repress the expression of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), a key protein in PD pathogenesis. Inhibition of miR-34b and miR-34c expression in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells increased \u03b1-syn levels and stimulated aggregate formation. Additionally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3'-UTR of \u03b1-syn was found to lower the miR-34b-mediated repression of the protein. Our results suggest that down-regulation of miR-34b and miR-34c in the brain, as well as an SNP in the 3'-UTR of \u03b1-syn can increase \u03b1-syn expression, possibly contributing to PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Urocortin (Ucn 1), a 40 amino acid long peptide related to corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) was discovered 19 years ago, based on its sequence homology to the parent molecule. Its existence was inferred in the CNS because of anatomical and pharmacological discrepancies between CRF and its two receptor subtypes. Although originally found in the brain, where it has opposing actions to CRF and therefore confers stress-coping mechanisms, Ucn 1 has subsequently been found throughout the periphery including heart, lung, skin, and immune cells. It is now well established that this small peptide is involved in a multitude of physiological and pathophysiological processes, due to its receptor subtype distribution and promiscuity in second messenger signalling pathways. As a result of extensive studies in this field, there are now well over one thousand peer reviewed publications involving Ucn 1. In this review, we intend to highlight some of the less well known actions of Ucn 1 and in particular its role in neuronal cell protection and maintenance of the skeletal system, both by conventional methods of reviewing the literature and using bioinformatics, to highlight further associations between Ucn 1 and disease conditions. Understanding how Ucn 1 works in these tissues, will help to unravel its role in normal and pathophysiological processes. This would ultimately allow the generation of putative medical interventions for the alleviation of important diseases such as Parkinson's disease, arthritis, and osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "The effects of dopaminergic therapy in parkinson's disease (PD) can vary depending on the class of medication selected.\nThe aim of this post hoc study was to determine if the class of dopaminergic therapy correlated with disease severity in persons with early, treated PD.\nA non-parametric global statistical test (GST) was used to assess the status of participants treated with dopamine agonist (DA) monotherapy, levodopa (LD) monotherapy or combined LD and DA therapy on multiple PD outcomes encompassing motor, cognitive, psychiatric and autonomic function, as well as disability and quality of life.\nThe outcomes measured at the beginning of the study showed lower disease burden for participants on initial DA monotherapy compared to those taking combined LD and DA therapy after controlling for age, education, taking cog-meds and amantadine.\nThis observation suggests that clinicians treating early PD patients favor combined LD and DA therapy in patients with more disabling features over DA monotherapy. As such, studies of PD progression in treated PD patients may be affected by the class of symptomatic dopaminergic therapy.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons that results in motor deficits including resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Despite decades of intensive study, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress contribute to neuronal death, which is the key feature of neurodegeneration. Mitochondria are pivotal organelles that host essential functions in neuronal viability including energy production, oxidative phosphorylation, calcium buffering, redox homeostasis and apoptosis. SIRT5, which localizes in the mitochondrial matrix, is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent histone deacetylase. The physiological and pathophysiological functions of SIRT5 in vivo remain elusive although it is known to be an important energy sensor. Here, we investigated the role of SIRT5 in the pathogenesis of PD mice induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). We present evidence that SIRT5 deficiency, by itself, does not affect motor and non-motor functions; however, lack of SIRT5 exacerbates MPTP-induced motor deficits. Consistently, MPTP-exposed SIRT5 knockout mice exhibited more severe nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration than that observed in wild-type controls. Furthermore, deletion of SIRT5 leads to a larger decrease, relative to control, in the expression level of manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2), a mitochondria-specific antioxidant enzyme, after MPTP induction. These findings indicate that SIRT5 ameliorates MPTP-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration via preserving mitochondrial antioxidant capacity.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is associated with early parasympathetic dysfunction leading to constipation and gastroparesis. It has been suggested that pathological \u03b1-synuclein aggregations originate in the gut and ascend to the brainstem via the vagus. Our understanding of the pathogenesis and time course of parasympathetic denervation in Parkinson's disease is limited and would benefit from a validated imaging technique to visualize the integrity of parasympathetic function. The positron emission tomography tracer 5-[(11)C]-methoxy-donepezil was recently validated for imaging acetylcholinesterase density in the brain and peripheral organs. Donepezil is a high-affinity ligand for acetylcholinesterase-the enzyme that catabolizes acetylcholine in cholinergic synapses. Acetylcholinesterase histology has been used for many years for visualizing cholinergic neurons. Using 5-[(11)C]-methoxy-donepezil positron emission tomography, we studied 12 patients with early-to-moderate Parkinson's disease (three female; age 64 \u00b1 9 years) and 12 age-matched control subjects (three female; age 62 \u00b1 8 years). We collected clinical information about motor severity, constipation, gastroparesis, and other parameters. Heart rate variability measurements and gastric emptying scintigraphies were performed in all subjects to obtain objective measures of parasympathetic function. We detected significantly decreased (11)C-donepezil binding in the small intestine (-35%; P = 0.003) and pancreas (-22%; P = 0.001) of the patients. No correlations were found between the (11)C-donepezil signal and disease duration, severity of constipation, gastric emptying time, and heart rate variability. In Parkinson's disease, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus undergoes severe degeneration and pathological \u03b1-synuclein aggregations are also seen in nerve fibres innervating the gastro-intestinal tract. In contrast, the enteric nervous system displays little or no loss of cholinergic neurons. Decreases in (11)C-donepezil binding may, therefore, represent a marker of parasympathetic denervation of internal organs, but further validation studies are needed.",

    "abstract": "Constipation is a frequent non-motor feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). It is the most common gastrointestinal symptom of the disease and it can precede motor symptoms by as much as 20 years. Constipation can produce discomfort and affect activities of daily living, productivity and quality of life, thus warranting early diagnosis and treatment.\nIn this review, the safety and efficacy of traditional and novel strategies for constipation management will be discussed. A treatment algorithm for constipation in PD will be presented.\nPolyethylene glycol and lubiprostone are first-line compounds recommended by evidence-based medicine guidelines for the treatment of constipation due to slow colonic transit in PD. Management of constipation secondary to defecatory dysfunction due to pelvic floor dyssynergia can be done by levodopa or apomorphine injections, botulinum toxin type A injection into the puborectalis muscle, and nonpharmacological interventions, like biofeedback therapy or functional magnetic stimulation, which showed some benefit in PD patients with constipation, but in general more extensive studies are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Obstacle crossing is a balance-challenging task and can cause falls in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, programs for people with PD that effectively target obstacle crossing and dynamic balance have not been established.\nTo examine the effects of virtual reality-based exercise on obstacle crossing performance and dynamic balance in participants with PD.\nThirty-six participants with a diagnosis of PD (Hoehn and Yahr score ranging 1 to 3) were randomly assigned to one of three groups. In the exercise groups, participants received virtual reality-based Wii Fit exercise (VRWii group) or traditional exercise (TE group) for 45 minutes, followed by 15 minutes of treadmill training in each session for a total of 12 sessions over 6 weeks. Participants in the control group received no structured exercise program. Primary outcomes included obstacle crossing performance (crossing velocity, stride length, and vertical toe obstacle clearance) and dynamic balance (maximal excursion, movement velocity, and directional control measured by the limits-of-stability test). Secondary outcomes included sensory organization test (SOT), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ39), fall efficacy scale (FES-I), and timed up and go test (TUG). All outcomes were assessed at baseline, after training, and at 1-month follow-up.\nThe VRWii group showed greater improvement in obstacle crossing velocity, crossing stride length, dynamic balance, SOT, TUG, FES-I, and PDQ39 than the control group. VRWii training also resulted in greater improvement in movement velocity of limits-of-stability test than TE training.\nVRWii training significantly improved obstacle crossing performance and dynamic balance, supporting implementation of VRWii training in participants with PD.",

    "abstract": "The role of Centella asiatica L. leaf extract was studied on the transgenic Drosophila model flies expressing normal human alpha synuclein (h-\u03b1S) in the neurons. The leaf extract was prepared in acetone and was subjected to GC-MS analysis. C. asiatica extract at final concentration of 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0\u2009\u03bcL/mL was mixed with the diet and the flies were allowed feeding on it for 24 days. The effect of extract was studied on the climbing ability, activity pattern, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl content, glutathione content, and glutathione-S-transferase activity in the brains of transgenic Drosophila. The exposure of extract to PD model flies results in a significant delay in the loss of climbing ability and activity pattern and reduced the oxidative stress (P < 0.05) in the brains of PD flies as compared to untreated PD flies. The results suggest that C. asiatica leaf extract is potent in reducing the PD symptoms in transgenic Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Several recent studies have pointed out that early impairment of executive functions (EFs) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) may be a crucial marker to detect patients at risk for developing dementia. The main objective of this study was to compare the performances of PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) with PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and a control group (CG) using a traditional assessment of EFs and the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET), a virtual reality (VR)-based tool. In order to understand which subcomponents of EFs are early impaired, this experimental study aimed to investigate specifically which instrument best discriminates among these three groups.\nThe study included three groups of 15 individuals each (for a total of 45 participants): 15 PD-NC; 15 PD-MCI, and 15 cognitively healthy individuals (CG). To assess the global neuropsychological functioning and the EFs, several tests (including the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clock Drawing Test, and Tower of London test) were administered to the participants. The VMET was used for a more ecologically valid neuropsychological evaluation of EFs.\nFindings revealed significant differences in the VMET scores between the PD-NC patients vs. the controls. In particular, patients made more errors in the tasks of the VMET, and showed a poorer ability to use effective strategies to complete the tasks. This VMET result seems to be more sensitive in the early detection of executive deficits because these two groups did not differ in the traditional assessment of EFs (neuropsychological battery).\nThis study offers initial evidence that a more ecologically valid evaluation of EFs is more likely to lead to detection of subtle executive deficits.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a selective loss of dopamine in the striatum. Problems remain in the accurate diagnosis of PD. The diagnosis of idiopathic PD is based on the interpretation of clinical signs and symptoms could be incorrect at the time of initial presentation. In vivo imaging of the dopaminergic system has the potential to improve the diagnosis of PD in its early stages. The imaging of dopamine transporter (DAT) with (99m)Tc-labeled tropane derivative (TRODAT-1) single photon emission computer tomography/computer tomography (SPECT/CT) has been proposed to be a valuable and feasible means of assessment of the integrity of dopamine neurons. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential usefulness of (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 imaging in the evaluation of patients with PD and classify into different stages of the disease. SPECT imaging with (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 was conducted in 16 consecutive PD patients (9 men; 7 women) and in 6 age matched healthy volunteers (4 men; 2 women). The images were obtained 3 h after the intra-venous injection of the tracer. Specific uptake in the striatum and its sub-regions, including the putamen and caudate nucleus was calculated and the ratios of specific striatal binding to nonspecific occipital binding were calculated. ANOVA with Dunnett C post-hoc analysis was conducted using SPSS 20. A stepwise reduction in specific striatal uptake of (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 with increasing disease severity between healthy control versus Stage I versus Stage II versus Stage III was found in PD patients (i.e., 3.77 vs. 2.56 vs. 1.57 vs. 0.63, P < 0.05). The changes were magnified by measurement of specific putaminal uptake (1.43 vs. 0.79 vs. 0.54 vs. 0.19, P < 0.05) and specific caudate uptake (1.90 vs. 1.47 vs. 0.73 vs. 0.27, P < 0.05). No remarkable adverse reactions were found in either healthy volunteers or PD patients during or after imaging. (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 is accurate and widely available for the assessment of DAT activity, which might shed light on the integrity of the presynaptic nigrostriatal function. Our preliminary study results confirm the potential of using (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 for DAT measurement, which is clinically important for the staging of PD.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence and clinical correlates of drooling in Chinese patients with Parkinson disease (PD) are unknown.\nA cross-sectional analysis of 518 Chinese patients with PD was conducted. Assessments included Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), PD Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), Frontal assessment battery (FAB) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).\nTwo hundred and seventy-three PD patients (52.7%) reported drooling (droolers). Drooling occurred more frequently in the late-onset PD patients than the early-onset PD patients (p < 0.05). Droolers had higher levodopa equivalent daily doses, higher incidences of dysarthria, dysphagia and fluctuation, higher scores for the UPDRS part III, NMSS, HAMD and HAMA, and higher scores for the mobility, activities of daily life, stigma and communication subdomains of the PDQ-39 than the non-droolers (p < 0.05). The percentage of benzhexol use in the non-droolers was significantly higher than the droolers (p < 0.05). The FAB and MoCA scores between the droolers and non-droolers were not different. The binary logistic regression analysis indicated that dysarthria, dysphagia, benzhexol use, and a lower score for the naming domain of the MoCA were associated with drooling.\nDrooling is a relatively common disabling symptom in Chinese PD patients. Patients with dysarthria, dysphagia and naming disorder are likely to experience drooling. Drooling is not correlated with disease duration and motor severity of PD.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have detailed involvement of the peripheral autonomic nervous system (PANS) in Parkinson's disease (PD). We assessed autonomic innervation of dermal annexes through quantitative fluorescence measurement from skin obtained via punch biopsies at distal leg region in PD and control subjects. We defined a ratio between the area corresponding to protein gen product (PGP) immunoreactivity and the area corresponding to blood vessel or sweat gland as a quantitative measure of autonomic innervation. Presence of alpha-synuclein (AS) deposits in dermis and hypodermis was also assessed by immunohistochemistry. Skin biopsies form six PD patients and six healthy controls were studied. Autonomic innervation scores were lower in PD than in controls in both blood vessels and sweat glands. No AS or phosphorylated AS (pAS) immunoreactivity was detected in dermis or hypodermis in any of the studied subjects. The results of this investigation suggest that autonomic innervation of dermal annexes in living patients with PD is reduced compared to controls. AS or pAS deposits were not found in dermis or hypodermis suggesting that distal leg skin study is not useful for in vivo detection of AS in PD.",

    "abstract": "Mutations of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) confer susceptibility to Parkinson's disease in several ethnical populations, with a high incidence especially in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Although there are several studies that have investigated a similar association in a Chinese population, small sample sizes and few positive outcomes have made it difficult to obtain conclusive results from these individual studies. Therefore, the present study used a meta-analysis approach, pooling the appropriate data from published studies to investigate the association of GBA mutations and Parkinson's disease in a Chinese population. Nine studies containing 6536 Chinese subjects (3438 cases and 3098 healthy controls) and examining the GBA mutations of L444P, N370S and several other mutations were included. Review Manager 5.2 software was applied to analyze the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The results showed a significant association of Parkinson's disease risk with overall GBA mutations (OR\u200a=\u200a6.34, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a3.77-10.68, p<0.00001), and with the subgroup of L444P mutation (OR\u200a=\u200a11.68, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a5.23-26.06, p<0.00001). No such association was observed for the subgroup with N370S mutation or other mutations, in part because of the small sample size or rare events. Thus, for the rare occurrence of GBA mutations, studies with larger sample size are necessary to minimize the sampling error and to obtain convincing results.",

    "abstract": "Neural tissue transplantation has been a promising strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, transplantation has the disadvantages of low-cell survival and/or development of dyskinesia. Transplantation of cell aggregates has the potential to overcome these problems, because the cells can extend their axons into the host brain and establish synaptic connections with host neurons. In this present study, aggregates of human brain-derived neural stem cells (HB-NSC) were transplanted into a PD animal model and compared to previous report on transplantation of single-cell suspensions.\nRats received an injection of 6-OHDA into the right medial forebrain bundle to generate the PD model and followed by injections of PBS only, or HB-NSC aggregates in PBS into the ipsilateral striatum. Behavioral tests, multitracer (2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]-fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]-FDG) and [(18)F]-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane ([(18)F]-FP-CIT) microPET scans, as well as immunohistochemical (IHC) and immunofluorescent (IF) staining were conducted to evaluate the results.\nThe stepping test showed significant improvement of contralateral forelimb control in the HB-NSC group from 6-10 weeks compared to the control group (p<0.05). [(18)F]-FP-CIT microPET at 10 weeks posttransplantation demonstrated a significant increase in uptake in the HB-NSC group compared to pretransplantation (p<0.05). In IHC and IF staining, tyrosine hydroxylase and human \u03b22 microglobulin (a human cell marker) positive cells were visualized at the transplant site.\nThese results suggest that the HB-NSC aggregates can survive in the striatum and exert therapeutic effects in a PD model by secreting dopamine.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is the most frequently seen non-motor symptom of Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). The aim of this study is to analyze selective olfactory dysfunction, and olfactory bulb volume (OBV) in subtypes of IPD, and compare them with those of the healthy controls.\nOur study included 41 patients with IPD and age and gender matched 19 healthy controls. IPD patients were either tremor dominant (65.9%; TDPD) or non-tremor dominant (34.1%; NTDPD) type. All patients underwent neurological, ear, nose, and throat examinations, and orthonasal olfaction testing. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique was used to measure the volume of the olfactory bulb.\nA significant decrease in olfactory identification scores was found in the patient group. The patients had difficulty in discriminating between odors of mothballs, chocolate, Turkish coffee and soap. OBV did not differ between the patient, and the control groups. In the TDPD group, odor identification ability was decreased when compared to the control group. However, odor test results of NTDPD, control and TDPD groups were similar. OBV estimates of the TDPD group were not different from those of the control group, while in the NTDPD group OBVs were found to be decreased. In all patients with Parkinson's disease OBV values did not vary with age of the patients, duration of the disease, age at onset of the disease, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores (UPDRS-m).\nOlfactory function is a complex process involving olfactory, and cortical structures as well. In Idiopathic Parkinson's disease, changes in OBV do not seem to be directly related to olfactory dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are at high risk for cognitive dysfunction. Non-pharmacological interventions have attracted increasing interest for enhancing PD patients' cognitive functions.\nOne-year follow-up data (T2 ) of a randomized controlled trial evaluating two 6-week cognitive trainings - a structured (NEUROvitalis, NV) and an unstructured (mentally fit, MF) program - compared with a waiting list control group (CG) in non-demented PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr I-III) are presented. Forty-seven PD patients were examined at T2 . Effects on overall cognitive functions (Mini-Mental State Examination and DemTect) were compared between all groups with repeated measurement analyses of variance. A combined score of the percentage change value from baseline (T0 ) to T2 was calculated to identify patients who retained or improved their cognitive state (responders). The risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was analyzed.\nSignificant time \u00d7 treatment effects on overall cognitive functions were found for both training groups, each compared separately to the CG (DemTect, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Nine patients (56.3%) of the NV group, seven (41.2%) of the MF group and three (21.4%) of the CG were responders. Comparing NV to CG the odds ratio was 4.7 [95% confidence interval (0.8; 33.3)], and comparing MF to CG it was 2.6 [95% confidence interval (0.4; 17.4)]. MCI risk for patients without prior MCI was 40.0% in CG, 18.2% in MF and 18.2% in NV. The odds ratio was 3 comparing NV to CG, MF to CG.\nThis study gives evidence that cognitive training may be effective to prevent cognitive decline and onset of MCI in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Depigmentation of the substantia nigra (SN) and locus coeruleus (LC) is a conspicuous pathological feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and is related to the loss of neuromelanin, whose paramagnetic properties result in high signal on specific T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recent studies have suggested that neuromelanin decrease in the SN and LC of PD patients may emerge as a possible diagnostic biomarker. The SN neuromelanin signal in de novo and early stage PD patients was studied to assess its diagnostic accuracy. This is the first study based on a semi-automated MRI analysis of the neuromelanin signal in de novo PD patients.\nThe inclusion criteria were untreated de novo PD and a 2-5\u00a0year disease duration; in addition, age matched healthy controls were enrolled. These were studied with a high-resolution T1-weighted MRI sequence at 3\u00a0T to visualize neuromelanin. The primary outcome was SN high signal area, length and neuromelanin/midbrain ratio obtained with semi-automated methods.\nA total of 12 de novo PD patients and 10 PD patients with a 2-5\u00a0year disease duration were evaluated. The area, length of the SN T1 high signal and the SN neuromelanin/midbrain ratio were markedly decreased in the PD groups compared with age-matched controls, with a substantial overlap between the two PD groups.\nNeuromelanin-sensitive MRI techniques can discriminate PD patients from healthy individuals with high sensitivity and specificity. Our findings are consistent with recent findings showing that PD neuromelanin changes remain stable during the course of the disease.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether, in patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD), longitudinal changes in midbrain iron content are associated with declining motor function over a period of three years.\nNineteen untreated subjects with early PD and 13 age- and sex-matched controls were followed clinically for 36 months. MRI with a 3 T magnet was performed at baseline, 18 months and 36 months with a multiple gradient echo sequence designed for rapid single-scan mapping of the proton transverse relaxation rate R2*. R2* was calculated for midbrain and forebrain basal ganglia regions.\nA difference in R2* between patients and controls was observed at baseline (p = 0.035) but not at 18 or 36 months in the lateral substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Linear regression indicated significant correlations between the change in R2* in the lateral SNc and the change score in UPDRS III (p = 0.008) and the PDQ-39 -mobility sub-score (p = 0.03) from baseline to 36 months. R2* tended to increase in those with more advanced disease and to decrease in those with milder disease.\nHigh field MRI demonstrates lateral SNc abnormalities that progress over 3 years in early PD consistent with increased iron content in those with more advanced disease, corresponding to the known distribution of neuronal loss occurring in this disorder, and correlating with motor symptomatology. Larger and longer investigations with more precise mapping of iron-containing midbrain structures are needed to fully evaluate the potential of R2* as a biomarker of disease progression in PD.",

    "abstract": "To investigate differences in urodynamic parameters between two groups: Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients.\nA retrospective study was performed in patients with PD and MSA who presented to three referral centers between 2005 and 2012. Patients referred to the urology department for lower urinary tract symptoms underwent urodynamic studies. Patients with other rare or ambiguous subtypes of PPS, urinary tract infection, urinary stones, or other neurogenic conditions were excluded from the analysis.\nA total of 581 consecutive patients (359 men and 222 women) were analyzed. The mean patient age was 69.2 (SD, 9.3) years. Among these patients, 390 (64.3%) had PD, and 191 (31.5%) had MSA. Patients with MSA showed a statistically significantly decreased maximal flow rate and increased post-void residual urine volume compared with patients with PD (P range, <0.001-0.005). In addition, voiding failure occurred more frequently in patients with MSA than in those with PD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.73). Patients with MSA showed a higher prevalence of low-compliance (P = 0.001), decreased bladder contractility (P < 0.001), and an increased rate of voiding failure (P = 0.001). In patients with MSA, decreased detrusor contractility was more prominent in the cerebellar ataxia predominant subtype (MSA-C; P = 0.038). Multivariate analysis showed that the MSA subtype was the only independent risk factor for impaired detrusor contractility (men, OR = 2.692; P = 0.006; women, OR = 2.965; P = 0.007).\nImpaired detrusor contractility was the pathognomonic urodynamic finding that distinguished MSA from PD.",

While proteins encoded by the genes, in particular RIT2, may involve in PD pathogenesis, the association of these two variants with PD remains to be further clarified.\nWe enrolled a Chinese cohort comprising 537 PD patients and 517 controls, determined the genotypes of rs12456492 and rs4889603, and analyzed these variants in relation to PD.\nBoth rs12456492 and rs4889603 were associated with PD susceptibility (P = 0.012 and 0.03, respectively). The G allele of rs12456492 and the A allele of rs4889603 served as risk alleles toward PD. Statistical differences in genotype distribution between the patients and controls were observed both in rs12456492 (marginal, P = 0.042 for GG vs. AG vs. AA) and in rs4889603 (P = 0.021 for AA + AG vs.\nOur data suggest that the RIT2 and STX1B polymorphisms are associated with PD etiology.

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has become an accepted treatment for motor symptoms in a subset of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The mechanisms why DBS is effective are incompletely understood, but previous studies show that DBS targeted in brain structures other than the STN may modify the microvasculature. However, this has not been studied in PD subjects who have received STN-DBS. Here we investigated the extent and nature of microvascular changes in post-mortem STN samples from STN-DBS PD patients, compared to aged controls and PD patients who had not been treated with STN-DBS. We used immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent methods to assess serial STN-containing brain sections from PD and STN-DBS PD cases, compared to similar age controls using specific antibodies to detect capillaries, an adherens junction and tight junction-associated proteins as well as activated microglia. Cellular features in stained sections were quantified by confocal fluorescence microscopy and stereological methods in conjunction with in vitro imaging tools. We found significant upregulation of microvessel endothelial cell thickness, length and density but lowered activated microglia density and striking upregulation of all analysed adherens junction and tight junction-associated proteins in STN-DBS PD patients compared to non-DBS PD patients and controls. Moreover, in STN-DBS PD samples, expression of an angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), was significantly upregulated compared to the other groups. Our findings suggest that overexpressed VEGF and downregulation of inflammatory processes may be critical mechanisms underlying the DBS-induced microvascular changes.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder. Functional interactions between some PD genes, like PINK1 and parkin, have been identified, but whether other ones interact remains elusive. Here we report an unexpected genetic interaction between two PD genes, VPS35 and EIF4G1. We provide evidence that EIF4G1 upregulation causes defects associated with protein misfolding. Expression of a sortilin protein rescues these defects, downstream of VPS35, suggesting a potential role for sortilins in PD. We also show interactions between VPS35, EIF4G1, and \u03b1-synuclein, a protein with a key role in PD. We extend our findings from yeast to an animal model and show that these interactions are conserved in neurons and in transgenic mice. Our studies reveal unexpected genetic and functional interactions between two seemingly unrelated PD genes and functionally connect them to \u03b1-synuclein pathobiology in yeast, worms, and mouse. Finally, we provide a resource of candidate PD genes for future interrogation.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), skill retention is poor, even when acquisition rate is generally preserved. Recent work in normal subjects suggests that 5\u00a0Hz-repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (5Hz-rTMS) may induce phenomena of long-term potentiation at the cortical level.\nWe thus verified whether, in PD, 5Hz-rTMS enhances retention of a visuo-motor skill that involves the activity of the right posterior parietal cortex.\nA group of patients with PD was tested in two two-day sessions, separated by one week (treatment and placebo sessions). The first day of each session, they learned to adapt their movements to a step-wise 60\u00b0 visual rotation. Immediately after the task, either real 5Hz-rTMS (treatment) or sham (placebo) stimulation was applied over the right posterior parietal cortex (P6). Retention of this motor skill was tested the following day.\nIn patients with PD, adaptation achieved at the end of training was comparable in the treatment and placebo sessions and was similar to that of a group of age-matched controls. However, retention indices tested on the following day were significantly lower in the placebo compared to the treatment session in which retention indices were restored to the level of the controls. Importantly, reaction and movement time as well as other kinematic measures were the same in the treatment and placebo sessions.\nThese results suggest that rTMS applied after the acquisition of a motor skill over specific areas involved in this process might enhance skill retention in PD.",

However, retention indices tested on the following day were significantly lower in the placebo compared to the treatment session in which retention indices were restored to the level of the controls. Importantly, reaction and movement time as well as other kinematic measures were the same in the treatment and placebo sessions.",

    "abstract": "This study analyze the characteristics and clinical medicine in 17 hospitals all over China, based on hospital information system diagnostic information database, including 4 497 cases of hospitalized patients with Parkinson's syndrome. Results indicate, the most common comorbidities are infarction, hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes and lung infections, including cerebral infarction, the combined incidence of hypertension in men reached 33.46% and 30.05%, respectively, it is slightly lower in the females. Men with coronary heart disease are more than women, women with diabetes and bone disease are more than men. Combined incidence of the disease increases with age, vascular factors occupy an important position. The most common combined diseases in patients with 90 years of age or older are coronary heart disease, lung infection, and often accompanied by metabolic disorders and nutritional emergency, critical care. Constipation, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment are common non-motor symptoms. The drug categories associated with Parkinson's core symptoms treatment are about 20% to 30% of clinical medicine, the others are associated with the treatment of combined disease, clinical medicine and disease spectrum consistent. Blood circulation topped Chinese agents applied frequency, reaching 44.52%; laxative drugs accounted for 11.66%; detoxification agent representing 9.46%. The first twenty Chinese medicine of the applying frequency reached 56.07% of the total utilization, including 12 kinds of traditional Chinese medicine injections, accounting for 60%. Therefore, in the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinsons syndrome, the treatment of comorbidities is very important, more attentions should be paid to vascular factors of the disease, Chinese medicine should be more concerned to improve the non-motor symptoms, give full play to the pharmaceutical multi-target, the overall regulation of advantages, integrative medicine, and improve the quality of life of patients.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have demonstrated that the pathophysiology and clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are inhomogeneous. However, the symptom-specific intrinsic neural activities underlying the PD subtypes are still not well understood. Here, 15 tremor-dominant PD patients, 10 non-tremor-dominant PD patients, and 20 matched normal controls (NCs) were recruited and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Functional brain networks were constructed based on randomly generated anatomical templates with and without the cerebellum. The regional network efficiencies (i.e., the local and global efficiencies) were further measured and used to distinguish subgroups of PD patients (i.e., with tremor-dominant PD and non-tremor-dominant PD) from the NCs using linear discriminant analysis. The results demonstrate that the subtype-specific functional networks were small-world-organized and that the network regional efficiency could discriminate among the individual PD subgroups and the NCs. Brain regions involved in distinguishing between the study groups included the basal ganglia (i.e., the caudate and putamen), limbic regions (i.e., the hippocampus and thalamus), the cerebellum, and other cerebral regions (e.g., the insula, cingulum, and calcarine sulcus). In particular, the performances of the regional local efficiency in the functional network were better than those of the global efficiency, and the performances of global efficiency were dependent on the inclusion of the cerebellum in the analysis. These findings provide new evidence for the neurological basis of differences between PD subtypes and suggest that the cerebellum may play different roles in the pathologies of different PD subtypes. The present study demonstrated the power of the combination of graph-based network analysis and discrimination analysis in elucidating the neural basis of different PD subtypes.",

    "abstract": "The association between Parkinson disease (PD) and depression remains unclear, particularly in the Asian population. The purpose of this study is to investigate the risk of depression in patients with PD using population-based data.\nBased on the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, we identified 1,698 patients with PD aged 40 years or older diagnosed in 2000-2003. With frequency matching procedure, we randomly selected 6,792 subjects without PD stratified by sex and age. Both cohorts were followed until the end of 2008 or diagnosis of depression. Risk of depression associated with PD was estimated in the multivariate Cox hazards regressions. Diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were more prevalent at baseline in patients with PD.\nCompared with the cohort without PD, the hazard ratio (HR) for depression in PD patients was 4.06 (95% CI: 3.15-5.23), which increased to 4.26 (95% CI: 3.29-5.51) after adjustment for age, sex, urbanization, income, and coexisting medical conditions. In the sex stratification, the HR of depression for men with PD was 4.42 (95% CI: 2.93-6.67) compared with men without PD. The HR for the association between PD and depression in women was 4.22 (95% CI: 3.02-5.88).\nThis study suggests that patients with PD are at an elevated risk of depression, particularly for men. Integrated care for early identification and treatment of depression are crucial for patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study is to analyse the influence that motor and non-motor symptoms have on the quality of life (QoL) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and to study the relationship between the two types of symptoms.\nThis cross-sectional study included 103 patients with PD (55 men and 48 women). Quality of life was measured on the PDQ-39 scale. The UPDRS scale (I-IV) was also used, and different items were grouped to analyse the presence of tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and axial symptoms. The non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS) was administered to assess non-motor symptoms. We performed correlation analyses between different scales to analyse the influence of motor and non-motor symptoms on QoL.\nCorrelations were observed between the PDQ-39 summary index (PDQ39_SI) and the NMSS (correlation coefficient [cc], 0.56; p<.001), UPDRS III (cc, 0.44; p<\u00a0.001) and UPDRS IV (cc, 0.37; p<.001) scores. The strongest correlation was between cognitive symptoms and mood. The analysis pointed to a direct relationship between the NMSS score and axial symptoms (cc, 0.384; p<.01), bradykinesia (cc, 0.299; p<.01), and to a lesser extent, rigidity (cc, 0.194; p<.05). No relationship was observed between presence of tremor and the NMSS score.\nCognitive symptoms and mood exert the most influence on QoL of patients with PD. We found at least two phenotypes; one with predominantly axial symptoms, with significant involvement of non-motor symptoms, and a tremor-associated phenotype in which these symptoms are less prevalent.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has argued that removal of relevant sensory information during the planning and control of simple, self-paced walking can result in increased demand on central processing resources in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, little is known about more complex gait tasks that require planning of gait adaptations to cross over an obstacle in PD.\nIn order to understand the interaction between availability of visual information relevant for self-motion and cognitive load, the current study evaluated PD participants and healthy controls while walking toward and stepping over an obstacle in three visual feedback conditions: (i) no visual restrictions; (ii) vision of the obstacle and their lower limbs while in complete darkness; (iii) vision of the obstacle only while in complete darkness; as well as two conditions including a cognitive load (with a dual task versus without a dual task). Each walk trial was divided into an early and late phase to examine changes associated with planning of step adjustments when approaching the obstacle.\nInteractions between visual feedback and dual task conditions during the obstacle approach were not significant. Patients with PD had greater deceleration and step time variability in the late phase of the obstacle approach phase while walking in both dark conditions compared to control participants. Additionally, participants with PD had a greater number of obstacle contacts when vision of their lower limbs was not available specifically during the dual task condition. Dual task performance was worse in PD compared to healthy control participants, but notably only while walking in the dark regardless of visual feedback.\nThese results suggest that reducing visual feedback while approaching an obstacle shifts processing to somatosensory feedback to guide movement which imposes a greater demand on planning resources. These results are key to fully understanding why trips and falls occur in those with PD.",

    "results": "Interactions between visual feedback and dual task conditions during the obstacle approach were not significant. Patients with PD had greater deceleration and step time variability in the late phase of the obstacle approach phase while walking in both dark conditions compared to control participants. Additionally, participants with PD had a greater number of obstacle contacts when vision of their lower limbs was not available specifically during the dual task condition. Dual task performance was worse in PD compared to healthy control participants, but notably only while walking in the dark regardless of visual feedback.",

    "abstract": "The preoperative neuroprotective effect of the 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced unilateral male animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been widely reported. However, the therapeutic approach to PD pathology would be closely associated with the post-lesion treatment by 7-NI in 6-OHDA-induced bilateral model. Also, there is a scarcity of data on neuroprotective effect of 7-NI in PD in females. We have studied the neuroprotective effects of 7-NI in 6-OHDA-induced bilaterally lesioned female rats after short-term post-lesion treatment. Sprague-Dawley female rats with bilateral intraventricular injection of either 6-OHDA (10.5\u03bcg) (n=8-11/group) or saline (sham; n=8/group) at substantia nigra (SN) were provided with 7-NI (30mg/kg/day) intraperitoneal, once a day during the 3 consecutive days of short term treatment. 6-OHDA lesioned animals developed the motor and non-motor deficits, which were evaluated by behavioral and neuro-biochemical tests from the substantia nigra. Post-lesion administration of 7-NI reduced the motor deficits induced by 6-OHDA in the behavioral tasks such as Rota rod, open field test and forced swim test. Simultaneously, the dopamine levels were restored by 7-NI in post lesion animals up to 76% in comparison to 6-OHDA lesioned animals (23%). Furthermore, antioxidant-like effect of 7-NI was observed in lipid peroxidation, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and reduced glutathione tests. Conclusively, the present study showed that early postoperative administration of 7-NI attenuates the motor deficits induced by 6-OHDA in bilaterally lesioned female rat model of PD.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) have identified a number of susceptibility loci in sporadic PD. Since the characteristics of those loci in a Han Chinese population from mainland China were unknown, we performed a case-control replication study in this population and evaluated several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in a recent GWAS-meta-analysis. In total, 933 subjects comprised of 460 PD patients and 473 controls were genotyped. We found strong evidence of an association for rs708723 in RAB7L1 in the total sample (genotype p=0.01, allele p=0.01, OR=0.78, 95% CI=0.65-0.94). With rs156429 in GPNMB, there was a significant difference in genotype and allele distribution between male PD patients and the control subgroup (genotype p=0.01, allele p=0.01, OR=0.67, 95% CI=0.49-0.92). However, we did not observe any significant difference in genotype or allele distribution between PD and control for rs34016896 in NMD3 and rs6812193 in STBD1.",

    "abstract": "The human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, is a commonly used cell line in studies related to neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and neurodegenerative diseases. Although this cell line is often used as a cellular model for Parkinson's disease, the relevance of this cellular model in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative diseases has not yet been systematically evaluated.\nWe have used a systems genomics approach to characterize the SH-SY5Y cell line using whole-genome sequencing to determine the genetic content of the cell line and used transcriptomics and proteomics data to determine molecular correlations. Further, we integrated genomic variants using a network analysis approach to evaluate the suitability of the SH-SY5Y cell line for perturbation experiments in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD.\nThe systems genomics approach showed consistency across different biological levels (DNA, RNA and protein concentrations). Most of the genes belonging to the major Parkinson's disease pathways and modules were intact in the SH-SY5Y genome. Specifically, each analysed gene related to PD has at least one intact copy in SH-SY5Y. The disease-specific network analysis approach ranked the genetic integrity of SH-SY5Y as higher for PD than for Alzheimer's disease but lower than for Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis for loss of function perturbation experiments.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade our perspective on essential tremor (ET) as a pure motor system disorder has begun to change. By virtue of recent studies of nonmotor symptoms (NMSs) that are used to characterize Parkinson's disease (PD), these symptoms have also been added to the definition of ET. There is increasing evidence to suggest that ET might not be as benign and monosymptomatic as we previously thought. The aim of this study was to evaluate nonmotor symptoms in ET, and to compare them with PD. We studied 37 ET and 23 PD patients. Tremor rate was evaluated using the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale (FTM-TRS) in ET patients. The patients with PD were scored for motor symptoms using the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS)-III and the Hoehn-Yahr scale. Cognitive functions were assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. NMSs were evaluated with the nonmotor symptoms questionnaire (NMSQuest). In the ET group, the most common NMSs were forgetting things, feeling sad, nocturia, urgency, and difficulty concentrating. The mean NMSQuest score was 8.43 \u00b1 4.14 in the ET group and 14.06 \u00b1 5.44 in the PD group (p value <0.001). However, except for 12 items in NMSQuest, in comparing items one by one there was no statistical difference between them. The mean MoCA total score was 17.81 \u00b1 4.56 in the ET group and 17.08 \u00b1 4.08 in the PD group (p value 0.675). There were no significant differences in MoCA subgroup scores. Evaluation of nonmotor symptoms in ET may help us to understand this emerging definition of ET. This study contributes evidence toward this new concept.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders seen in the United States and United Kingdom. The disease is characterised by two processes-cellular degeneration and the resulting biochemical deficiency of dopamine. Although these processes are inter-related, they are approached separately in the clinical setting. Currently, no proven neuroprotective or disease modifying treatment is available for Parkinson's disease. Several agents can be used to treat the motor symptoms associated with dopamine deficiency, and it is important to choose wisely when starting treatment. Drugs can have mild, moderate, or high potency, and the patient's goals, comorbidities, and the short and long term implications of choosing a specific agent should be taken into account when selecting the appropriate agent. Non-motor symptoms, such as depression, fatigue, and disorders of sleep and wakefulness, also need to be evaluated and treated. Research is under way to deliver dopaminergic therapy more effectively, but studies aimed at slowing or stopping disease progression have not shown promise.",

    "abstract": "There has been little attempt to summarise and synthesise qualitative studies concerning the experience and perception of living with Parkinson's disease. Bringing this information together would provide a background to understand the importance of an individual's social identity on their well-being and hope. Three primary aims were identified (a) understanding the importance of social identity and meaningful activities on individuals' well-being, (b) identifying factors and strategies that influence well-being and hope, and (c) establishing a model that relates to an individual's hope and well-being. Three stages were undertaken including a traditional electronic search, a critical appraisal of articles, and a synthesis of studies. Qualitative articles were included that considered the experience of living with Parkinson's disease. Thirty seven articles were located and included in the review. Five themes were identified and the themes were used to inform development of a new model of hope enablement. The current review furthered understanding of how physical symptoms and the experience of Parkinson's disease affect the individual's well-being and hope. Social identity was established as a key factor that influenced an individual's well-being. Being able to maintain, retain, or develop social identities was essential for the well-being and hope of individuals with Parkinson's disease. Understanding the factors which prevent or can facilitate this is essential.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD)\u2014classically characterized by severe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta\u2014has a caudal-rostral progression, beginning in the dorsal motor vagal nucleus and, in a less extent, in the olfactory system, progressing to the midbrain and eventually to the basal forebrain and the neocortex. About 90% of the cases are idiopathic. To study the molecular mechanisms involved in idiopathic PD we conducted a comparative study of transcriptional interaction networks in the dorsal motor vagal nucleus (VA), locus coeruleus (LC), and substantia nigra (SN) of idiopathic PD in Braak stages 4-5 (PD) and disease-free controls (CT) using postmortem samples. Gene coexpression networks (GCNs) for each brain region (patients and controls) were obtained to identify highly connected relevant genes (hubs) and densely interconnected gene sets (modules). GCN analyses showed differences in topology and module composition between CT and PD networks for each anatomic region. In CT networks, VA, LC, and SN hub modules are predominantly associated with neuroprotection and homeostasis in the ageing brain, whereas in the patient's group, for the three brain regions, hub modules are mostly related to stress response and neuron survival/degeneration mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Urinary dopamine fluctuations in the competitive inhibition state were first documented in 2009. At that time, it was noted that progressively higher daily dosing values of L-tyrosine decreased the magnitude of these fluctuations. While extensive statistical analysis has been performed by the authors since 2004, it was not until 2012 that a plausible explanation was formulated. In the process, correlations with L-tyrosine administration and the on/off effect of Parkinson's disease were defined. This paper documents the current knowledge with regard to the management of retrograde phase 1 dopamine fluctuations and investigates the hypothesis that they are caused by a melanin steal phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, neurons that are regulated by the development, protection and function of neuregulin-1 (NRG1)-ErbB4 signals, in the substantia nigra (SN). NRG1 is a neurotrophic differentiation factor and one of its isoforms is a sensory and motor neuron-derived factor (SMDF), mostly expressed in neurons. To examine the relationship between NRG1 SMDF and PD, we tested whether NRG1 SMDF can be detected and measured in plasma and whether their level in plasma correlates with the clinical severity of PD. We detected NRG1 SMDF to be immunoreactive in plasma. Using an ELISA method specific for NRG1 SMDF, we found that NRG1 SMDF levels were significantly reduced in sporadic PD as compared to controls. However, levels of plasma NRG1 SMDF showed no correlation with the clinical severity of PD. Additionally, we found that there was a correlation of NRG1 SMDF levels in CSF with that in plasma where levels in plasma were significantly higher, at approximately ten times that in CSF. Finally, we also examined the expression of NRG1 SMDF in the post-mortem brain using immunohistochemistry and showed that Lewy bodies in the SN of patients with PD were immunoreactive for NRG1 SMDF. In summary, we found that the reduction of plasma NRG1 SMDF is specifically associated with PD, but has no correlation with the clinical severity of PD. These findings of NRG1 SMDF may provide important complementary information for diagnosing the onset of PD.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have validated the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and reported adequate reliability and construct validity. However, the factorial validity of the HAMD has not yet been investigated. The aim of our analysis was to explore the factor structure of the HAMD in a large sample of PD patients.\nA principal component analysis of the 17-item HAMD was performed on data of 341 PD patients, available from a previous cross sectional study on anxiety. An eigenvalue \u22651 was used to determine the number of factors. Factor loadings \u22650.4 in combination with oblique rotations were used to identify which variables made up the factors. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure (KMO), Cronbach's alpha, Bartlett's test, communality, percentage of non-redundant residuals and the component correlation matrix were computed to assess factor validity.\nKMO verified the sample's adequacy for factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha indicated a good internal consistency of the total scale. Six factors had eigenvalues \u22651 and together explained 59.19% of the variance. The number of items per factor varied from 1 to 6. Inter-item correlations within each component were low. There was a high percentage of non-redundant residuals and low communality.\nThis analysis demonstrates that the factorial validity of the HAMD in PD is unsatisfactory. This implies that the scale is not appropriate for studying specific symptom domains of depression based on factorial structure in a PD population.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence supports a role for the immune system in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Importantly, recent preclinical studies are now suggesting a specific contribution of inflammation to the \u03b1-synuclein-induced pathology seen in this condition.\nWe used flow cytometry and western blots to detect toll-like receptor 2 and 4 expression in blood and brain samples of Parkinson's disease patients and mice overexpressing human \u03b1-synuclein. To further assess the effects of \u03b1-synuclein overexpression on the innate immune system, we performed a longitudinal study using Thy1.2-\u03b1-synuclein mice that expressed a bicistronic DNA construct (reporter genes luciferase and green fluorescent protein) under the transcriptional control of the murine toll-like receptor 2 promoter.\nHere, we report increases in toll-like receptors 2 and 4 expression in circulating monocytes and of toll-like receptor 4 in B cells and in the caudate/putamen of Parkinson's disease patients. Monthly bioluminescence imaging of Thy1.2-\u03b1-synuclein mice showed increasing toll-like receptor 2 expression from 10 months of age, although no change in toll-like receptor 2 and 4 expression was observed in the blood and brain of these mice at 12 months of age. Dexamethasone treatment starting at 5 months of age for 1 month significantly decreased the microglial response in the brain of these mice and promoted functional recovery as observed using a wheel-running activity test.\nOur results show that toll-like receptors 2 and 4 are modulated in the blood and brain of Parkinson's disease patients and that overexpression of \u03b1-synuclein leads to a progressive microglial response, the inhibition of which has a beneficial impact on some motor phenotypes of an animal model of \u03b1-synucleinopathy.",

    "abstract": "Cell transplantation and gene therapy each show promise to enhance the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, because cell transplantation and gene therapy generally require direct delivery to the central nervous system, clinical trial design involves unique scientific, ethical, and financial concerns related to the invasive nature of the procedure. Typically, such biologics have been tested in PD patients who have not received any neurosurgical intervention. Here, we suggest that PD patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) device implantation are an ideal patient population for the clinical evaluation of cell transplantation and gene therapy. Randomizing subjects to an experimental group that receives the biologic concurrently with the DBS implantation-or to a control group that receives the DBS treatment alone-has several compelling advantages. First, this study design enables the participation of patients likely to benefit from DBS, many of whom simultaneously meet the inclusion criteria of biologic studies. Second, the need for a sham neurosurgical procedure is eliminated, which may reduce ethical concerns, promote patient recruitment, and enhance the blinding of surgical trials. Third, testing the biologic by \"piggybacking\" onto an established, reimbursable procedure should reduce the cost of clinical trials, which may allow a greater number of biologics to reach this critical stage of research translation. Finally, this clinical trial design may lead to combinatorial treatment strategies that provide PD patients with more durable control over disabling motor symptoms. By combining neuromodulation with biologics, we may also reveal important treatment paradigms relevant to other diseases of the brain.",

    "abstract": "Our objective in this study was to evaluate the nutritional status and to identify clinical, psychosocial, and nutritional factors contributing to malnutrition in Korean patients with Parkinson's disease. We used a descriptive, cross-sectional study design. Of 102 enrolled patients, 26 (25.5%) were malnourished and 27 (26.5%) were at risk of malnutrition based on Mini-Nutritional Assessment scores. Malnutrition was related to activity of daily living score, Hoehn and Yahr stage, duration of levodopa therapy, Beck Depression Inventory and Spielberger's Anxiety Inventory scores, body weight, body weight at onset of Parkinson's disease, and body mass index. On multiple logistic regression analysis, anxiety score, duration of levodopa therapy, body weight at onset of Parkinson's disease, and loss of body weight were significant factors predicting malnutrition in Parkinson's disease patients. Therefore, nutritional assessment, including psychological evaluation, is required for Parkinson's disease patients to facilitate interdisciplinary nutritional intervention for malnourished patients.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deficits are commonly found in untreated subjects with a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Additionally, different studies report declines in olfactory performance during a short period of sleep deprivation. Mechanisms underlying these clinical manifestations are poorly understood, and impairment of dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in the olfactory bulb and the nigrostriatal pathway may have important roles in olfaction and REM sleep disturbances. Therefore, we hypothesized that modulation of the dopaminergic D2 receptors in the olfactory bulb could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the olfactory deficits in PD and REM sleep deprivation (REMSD). We decided to investigate the olfactory, neurochemical, and histological alterations generated through the administration of piribedil (a selective D2 agonist) or raclopride (a selective D2 antagonist) within the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, in rats subjected to intranigral rotenone and REMSD. Our findings provide evidence of the occurrence of a negative correlation (r = -0.52, P = 0.04) between the number of periglomerular TH-ir neurons and the bulbar levels of DA in the rotenone, but not sham, groups. A significant positive correlation (r = 0.34, P = 0.03) was observed between nigrostriatal DA levels and olfactory discrimination index (DI) for the sham groups, indicating that increased DA levels in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) are associated with enhanced olfactory discrimination performance. Also, increased levels in bulbar and striatal DA were induced by piribedil in the rotenone control and rotenone REMSD groups, consistent with reductions in the DI. The present evidence reinforce the idea that DA produced by periglomerular neurons, particularly the bulbar dopaminergic D2 receptors, is an essential participant in olfactory discrimination processes, as the SNpc, and the striatum.",

    "abstract": "Clinically, predicting the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and diagnosing dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD) are difficult. This study aims to explore an integrative electroencephalography (EEG) frequency power that could be used to predict the progression of MCI in PD patients. Twenty-six PD patients, in this study, were divided into the mild cognitive impairment group (PDMCI, 17 patients) and dementia group (PDD, 9 patients) according to cognitive performance. Beta peak frequency, alpha relative power, and alpha/theta power were recorded and analyzed for the prediction. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores at initiation, in the first year, and in the second year were examined. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, Matthew correlation coefficient, and positive likelihood ratio were calculated in both the integrative EEG biomarkers and single best biomarker. Of the 17 patients with MCI for 2 years, 6 progressed to dementia. Integrative EEG biomarkers, mainly associated with beta peak frequency, can predict conversion from MCI to dementia. These biomarkers had sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 78%, compared with sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 58% of the beta peak frequency. In conclusion, the integrative EEG frequency powers were more sensitive and specific to MCI progression in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Pathological mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) have been suggested to be associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) in various ethnic populations. Most studies on Chinese PD patients have only screened the N370S and L444P mutations in the GBA gene. To investigate the GBA mutations in Chinese population, we performed complete sequencing of the GBA gene in 184 Chinese PD patients and 130 Chinese control individuals. As a result, we identified three novel and nine reported GBA mutations. The novel mutations include 5-bp deletion (c.334_338delCAGAA), L264I and L314V and the nine reported GBA mutations are R163Q, F213I, E326K, S364S, F347L, V375L, L444P, RecNciI and Q497R. The novel 5-bp deletion (CAGAA) produces a short truncated GBA protein of 142 amino acids, which loses major function domains of the 536 amino acids. Our data also reveals that the frequency of GBA mutations within this Chinese PD cohort was 8.7%, which is significantly higher than 1.54% observed in the Chinese control cohort (\u03c7(2) = 7.22, P = 0.0072; odds ratio (OR) = 6.095, 95% confidence interval of OR = 1.546-24.030). The most common L444P mutation accounts 2.74%, which confer more genetic risk for PD in this Chinese population. In conclusion, novel and known GBA mutations were identified and were found to be associated to PD in this Chinese population.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms (NMS) ofParkinson's disease (PD) have been recently recognized to be as disabling as motor symptoms in PD. However these symptoms are still under recognized causing delay in treatment and inadequate management. This study aimed to identify NMS in Thai PD patients using the NMS screening questionnaire (NMSQuest).\nPatients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease visiting the neurology clinic in 2008 were enrolled. NMSQuest-Thai version (NMSQ-T) was applied to patients to identify NMS.\nCollected data from questionnaires completed by 165 probable idiopathic PD was analyzed. The demographic profiles showed mean age of 68.6 years with mean disease duration 5.4 years, and male 56.4%. Patients had Hoehn & Yahrstaging, stage-2: 43%, stage-3: 24.8%, stage-I: 24.2% and stage-4: 7.9%. The average dosage oflevodopa was 456.4 mg/d. Mean total NMSQ-T score was 9.5. Most prevalent of non-motor symptom was nocturia (64.2%). The domains which gained most positive answers were urinary domain (54.55%). Inter-domain correlations were significantly found in all, except the sexual domain. Multivariate analysis revealed the duration ofPD and stages were significantly correlated with the total score ofNMS. Only three percent denied having any non-motor symptoms.\nAlmost all Thai PD had NMS. Urinary domain is the most prevalent in our series. Screening using NMSQ-Tto recognize NMS would be a helpful tool to improve the quality of life in Thai Parkinson 's disease.",

    "abstract": "Considerable progress has been made in generating fully functional and transplantable dopamine neurons from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Before these cells can be used for cell replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD), it is important to verify their functional properties and efficacy in animal models. Here we provide a comprehensive preclinical assessment of hESC-derived midbrain dopamine neurons in a rat model of PD. We show long-term survival and functionality using clinically relevant MRI and PET imaging techniques and demonstrate efficacy in restoration of motor function with a potency comparable to that seen with human fetal dopamine neurons. Furthermore, we show that\u00a0hESC-derived dopamine neurons can project sufficiently long distances for use in humans, fully regenerate midbrain-to-forebrain projections, and innervate correct target structures. This provides strong preclinical support for clinical translation of hESC-derived dopamine neurons using approaches similar to those established with fetal cells for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Neuroprotective effect of scorpion venom on Parkinson's disease (PD) has already been reported. The present study was aimed to investigate whether scorpion venom heat resistant peptide (SVHRP) could attenuate ultrastructural abnormalities in mitochondria and oxidative stress in midbrain neurons of early-stage PD model. The early-stage PD model was established by injecting 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (20 \u03bcg/3 \u03bcL normal saline with 0.1% ascorbic acid) into the striatum of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats unilaterally. The rats were intraperitoneally administered with SVHRP (0.05 mg/kg per day) or vehicle (saline) for 1 week. Two weeks after 6-OHDA treatment, the rats received behavior tests for validation of model. Three weeks after 6-OHDA injection, the immunoreactivity of dopaminergic neurons were detected by immunohistochemistry staining, and the ultrastructure of neuronal mitochondria in midbrain was observed by electron microscope. In the meantime, the activities of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the mitochondria of the midbrain neurons, as well as the inhibitory ability of hydroxyl free radical and the antioxidant ability in the serum, were measured by corresponding kits. The results showed that 6-OHDA reduced the optical density of dopaminergic neurons, induced damage of mitochondrial ultrastructure of midbrain neurons, decreased SOD activity, increased MAO-B activity and MDA content, and reduced the antioxidant ability of the serum. SVHRP significantly reversed the previous harmful effects of 6-OHDA in early-stage PD model. These findings indicate that SVHRP may contribute to neuroprotection by preventing biochemical and ultrastructure damage changes which occur during early-stage PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, as well as in other brain areas. The currently available dopamine replacement therapy provides merely symptomatic benefit and is ineffective because habituation and side effects arise relatively quickly. Studying the genetic forms of PD in animal models provides novel insight that allows targeting of specific aspects of this heterogenic disease more specifically. Among others, two important cellular deficits are associated with PD; these deficits relate to (1) synaptic transmission and vesicle trafficking, and (2) mitochondrial function, relating respectively to the dominant and recessive mutations in PD-causing genes. With increased knowledge of PD, the possibility of identifying an efficient, long-lasting treatment is becoming more conceivable, but this can only be done with an increased knowledge of the specific affected cellular mechanisms. This review discusses how discoveries in animal models of PD have clarified the therapeutic potential of pathways disrupted in PD, with a specific focus on synaptic transmission, vesicle trafficking, and mitochondrial function.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate whether serum triglycerides (S-TG), cholesterol, blood pressure and waist/height ratio are risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD).\nA population-based sample within the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study (NSHDS) was used in this study (n=101\u2009790 subjects). Cases with PD were identified prospectively in a community-based study of idiopathic Parkinsonism in the period 2004-2009 in the county of V\u00e4sterbotten in northern Sweden. The case database obtained was crosslinked to the NSHDS. Eighty-four of 147 patients with PD had visited the primary health care 2-8 years before diagnosis for participation in the NSHDS. For each case, four referents from the NSHDS population were selected, matched for sex, age, year of health survey, subcohort and geographic area.\nCases had lower mean S-TG levels (P=0.007). After stratification for sex, the lower S-TG remained significant for men (P=0.006) but not for women (P=0.450), and these were confirmed by the conditional logistic regression for all cases, none adjusted (hazard ratio (HR): 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42, 0.99) and after adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.96). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was negatively associated with PD risk after adjustments for age, BMI and physical activity (HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.97-0.99). Smoking and former smoking were associated with a reduced risk for PD.\nWe found lower S-TG and SBP 2-8 years before a diagnosis of PD. Smoking was confirmed to be negatively associated with PD, whereas recreational activity indicates a risk for women.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by two major neuropathological hallmarks: the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the presence of Lewy bodies in the surviving SN neurons, as well as other regions of the central and peripheral nervous system. Animal models have been invaluable tools for investigating the underlying mechanisms of the pathogenesis of PD and testing new potential symptomatic, neuroprotective and neurorestorative therapies. However, the usefulness of these models is dependent on how precisely they replicate the features of clinical PD with some studies now employing combined gene-environment models to replicate more of the affected pathways. The rotenone model of PD has become of great interest following the seminal paper by the Greenamyre group in 2000 (Betarbet et al., 2000). This paper reported for the first time that systemic rotenone was able to reproduce the two pathological hallmarks of PD as well as certain parkinsonian motor deficits. Since 2000, many research groups have actively used the rotenone model worldwide. This paper will review rotenone models, focusing upon their ability to reproduce the two pathological hallmarks of PD, motor deficits, extranigral pathology and non-motor symptoms. We will also summarize the recent advances in neuroprotective therapies, focusing on those that investigated non-motor symptoms and review rotenone models used in combination with PD genetic models to investigate gene-environment interactions.",

    "abstract": "It is solidly established that top-down (goal-driven) and bottom-up (stimulus-driven) attention mechanisms depend on distributed cortical networks, including prefrontal and frontoparietal regions. On the other hand, it is less clear whether the BG also contribute to one or the other of these mechanisms, or to both. The current study was principally undertaken to clarify this issue. Parkinson disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting the BG, has proven to be an effective model for investigating the contribution of the BG to different brain functions; therefore, we set out to investigate deficits of top-down and bottom-up attention in a selected cohort of PD patients. With this objective in mind, we compared the performance on three computerized tasks of two groups of 12 parkinsonian patients (assessed without any treatment), one otherwise pharmacologically treated and the other also surgically treated, with that of a group of controls. The main behavioral tool for our study was an attentional capture task, which enabled us to tap the competition between top-down and bottom-up mechanisms of visual attention. This task was suitably combined with a choice RT and a simple RT task to isolate any specific deficit of attention from deficits in motor response selection and initiation. In the two groups of patients, we found an equivalent increase of attentional capture but also comparable delays in target selection in the absence of any salient distractor (reflecting impaired top-down mechanisms) and movement initiation compared with controls. In contrast, motor response selection processes appeared to be prolonged only in the operated patients. Our results confirm that the BG are involved in both motor and cognitive domains. Specifically, damage to the BG, as it occurs in PD, leads to a distinct deficit of top-down control of visual attention, and this can account, albeit indirectly, for the enhancement of attentional capture, reflecting weakened ability of top-down mechanisms to antagonize bottom-up control.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease, the long-term use of dopamine replacing agents is associated with the development of motor complications; therefore, there is a need for non-dopaminergic drugs. This study evaluated the potential therapeutic impact of six different NR2B and A2A receptor antagonists given either alone or in combination in unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned rats without (monotherapy) or with (add-on therapy) the co-administration of L-Dopa: Sch-58261+ Merck 22; Sch-58261+Co-101244; Preladenant + Merck 22; Preladenant + Radiprodil; Tozadenant + Radiprodil; Istradefylline + Co-101244. Animals given monotherapy were assessed on distance traveled and rearing, whereas those given add-on therapy were assessed on contralateral rotations. Three-way mixed ANOVA were conducted to assess the main effect of each drug separately and to determine whether any interaction between two drugs was additive or synergistic. Additional post hoc analyses were conducted to compare the effect of the combination with the effect of the drugs alone. Motor activity improved significantly and was sustained for longer when the drugs were given in combination than when administered separately at the same dose. Similarly, when tested as add-on treatment to L-Dopa, the combinations resulted in higher levels of contralateral rotation in comparison to the single drugs. Of special interest, the activity observed with some combinations could not be described by a simplistic additive effect and involved more subtle synergistic pharmacological interactions. The combined administration of A2A/NR2B-receptor antagonists improved motor behaviour in 6-OHDA rats. Given the proven translatability of this model such a combination may be expected to be effective in improving motor symptoms in patients.",

    "abstract": "Radiofrequency (RF) subthalamotomies have been proposed since the 1960s to treat patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, the magnetic resonance (MR)-guided focused ultrasound technology (MRgFUS) offers the possibility to perform subthalamic thermocoagulations with reduced risks and optimized accuracy. We describe here the initial results of the MRgFUS pallidothalamic tractotomy (PTT), an anatomical and physiological update of the earlier subthalamotomies.\nThirteen consecutive patients suffering from chronic (mean disease duration 9.7\u00a0years) and therapy-resistant PD were treated unilaterally with an MRgFUS PTT. Primary relief assessment indicators were the score reduction of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the patient estimation of global symptom relief (GSR) taken at 3\u00a0months follow-up. Final temperatures at target were between 52\u00b0C and 59\u00b0C. The MR examinations were performed before the treatment, 2\u00a0days and 3\u00a0months after it. The accuracy of the targeting was calculated on 2\u00a0days post-treatment MR pictures for each PTT lesion.\nThe first four patients received a PTT using the lesional parameters applied for thalamotomies. They experienced clear-cut recurrences at 3\u00a0months (mean UPDRS relief 7.6%, mean GSR 22.5%), and their MR showed no sign of thermal lesion in T2-weighted (T2w) images. As a consequence, the treatment protocol was adapted for the following nine patients by applying repetition of the final temperatures 4 to 5 times. That produced thermocoagulations of larger volumes (172\u00a0mm(3) against 83\u00a0mm(3) for the first four patients), which remained visible at 3\u00a0months on T2w images. These nine patients enjoyed a mean UPDRS reduction of 60.9% and a GSR of 56.7%, very close to the results obtained with radiofrequency lesioning. The targeting accuracy for the whole patient group was 0.5, 0.5, and 0.6\u00a0mm for the anteroposterior (AP), mediolateral (ML), and dorsoventral (DV) dimensions, respectively.\nThis study demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and accuracy of the MRgFUS PTT. To obtain similar results as the ones of RF PTT, it was necessary to integrate the fact that white matter, in this case, the pallidothalamic tract, requires repeated thermal exposition to achieve full lesioning and thus full therapeutic effect.",

    "results": "The first four patients received a PTT using the lesional parameters applied for thalamotomies. They experienced clear-cut recurrences at 3\u00a0months (mean UPDRS relief 7.6%, mean GSR 22.5%), and their MR showed no sign of thermal lesion in T2-weighted (T2w) images. As a consequence, the treatment protocol was adapted for the following nine patients by applying repetition of the final temperatures 4 to 5 times. That produced thermocoagulations of larger volumes (172\u00a0mm(3) against 83\u00a0mm(3) for the first four patients), which remained visible at 3\u00a0months on T2w images. These nine patients enjoyed a mean UPDRS reduction of 60.9% and a GSR of 56.7%, very close to the results obtained with radiofrequency lesioning. The targeting accuracy for the whole patient group was 0.5, 0.5, and 0.6\u00a0mm for the anteroposterior (AP), mediolateral (ML), and dorsoventral (DV) dimensions, respectively.",

    "abstract": "L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) is the gold standard for symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), but long-term therapy is associated with the emergence of L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). In the present study, L-dopa and benserazide were loaded by poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres (LBM), which can release levodopa and benserazide in a sustained manner in order to continuous stimulate dopaminergic receptors. We investigated the role of striatal DR1/PKA/P-tau signal transduction in the molecular event underlying LID in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rat model of PD. We found that animals rendered dyskinetic by L-dopa treatment, administration of LBM prevented the severity of AIM score, as well as improvement in motor function. Moreover, we also showed L-dopa elicits profound alterations in the activity of three LID molecular markers, namely DR1/PKA/P-tau (ser396). These modifications are totally prevented by LBM treatment, a similar way to achieve continuous dopaminergic delivery (CDD). In conclusion, our experiments provided evidence that intermittent administration of L-dopa, but not continuous delivery, and DR1/PKA/p-tau (ser396) activation played a critical role in the molecular and behavioural induction of LID in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. In addition, LBM treatment prevented the development of LID by inhibiting the expression of DR1/PKA/p-tau, as well as PPEB mRNA in dyskintic rats.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative disorders. For both diseases, early intervention is thought to be essential to the success of disease-modifying treatments. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can reflect some of the pathophysiological changes that occur in the brain, and the number of CSF biomarkers under investigation in neurodegenerative conditions has grown rapidly in the past 20 years. In AD, CSF biomarkers are increasingly being used in clinical practice, and have been incorporated into the majority of clinical trials to demonstrate target engagement, to enrich or stratify patient groups, and to find evidence of disease modification. In PD, CSF biomarkers have not yet reached the clinic, but are being studied in patients with parkinsonism, and are being used in clinical trials either to monitor progression or to demonstrate target engagement and downstream effects of drugs. CSF biomarkers might also serve as surrogate markers of clinical benefit after a specific therapeutic intervention, although additional data are required. It is anticipated that CSF biomarkers will have an important role in trials aimed at disease modification in the near future. In this Review, we provide an overview of CSF biomarkers in AD and PD, and discuss their role in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria play an important role in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). While mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been shown to accumulate in PD, no specific mtDNA polymorphisms have been associated with susceptibility or resistance to PD. A cytosine to adenine transversion at base pair 5178 in the mtDNA has been associated with increased longevity and resistance against a number of age related disorders and has been shown to decrease mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We sought to determine whether 5178A is associated with resistance against PD in a Han Chinese population. To assess its association with PD, we genotyped 484 idiopathic PD patients and 710 control individuals for 5178C/A. Genotyping was performed using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. There was no significant association between 5178A and PD (P=0.308) when analyzing the entire population. However, sub-group analysis revealed that in males the frequency of 5178A was significantly lower in PD patients (27.7% in controls vs 20.0% in PD patients, P=0.027). Stratification of the population by age showed that this trend held across age groups but only reached statistical significance in males aged 60-70 (29.1% in controls vs 14.05 in PD patients, P=0.011). In conclusion, we demonstrated that the frequency of 5178A was significantly decreased in male PD patients in a Han Chinese population. This polymorphism may be associated with resistance against the development of PD when in combination with loci on the Y chromosome.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of different parkinsonian syndromes is linked with high misdiagnosis rates and various confounding factors. This is particularly problematic in its early stages. With this in mind, the current pilot study aimed to distinguish between Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (iPD), other Parkinsonian syndromes (non-iPD) and healthy subjects, by a breath test that analyzes the exhaled volatile organic compounds using a highly sensitive nanoarray.\nBreath samples of 44 iPD, 16 non-iPD patients and 37 healthy controls were collected. The samples were passed over a nanoarray and the resulting electrical signals were analyzed with discriminant factor analysis as well as by a K-fold cross-validation method, to test the accuracy of the model.\nComparison of non-iPD with iPD states yielded 88% sensitivity, 88% accuracy, and 88% Receiver Operating Characteristic area under the curve in the training set samples with known identity. The validation set of this comparison scored 81% sensitivity and accuracy and 92% negative predictive value. Comparison between atypical parkinsonism states and healthy subjects scored 94% sensitivity and 85% accuracy in the training set samples with known identity. The validation set of this comparison scored 81% sensitivity and 78% accuracy. The obtained results were not affected by l-Dopa or MAO-B inhibitor treatment.\nExhaled breath analysis with nanoarray is a promising approach for a non-invasive, inexpensive, and portable technique for differentiation between different Parkinsonian states. A larger cohort is required in order to establish the clinical usefulness of the method.",

    "abstract": "Visual hallucinations are an important non-motor complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) and carry a negative prognosis. Their biological basis is uncertain, but may relate to the activity of resting state networks in brain. We therefore aimed to investigate functional activity of brain in patients with visual hallucinations (PDVH) in resting state compared to patients without hallucinations (PDnonVH) and a healthy control group (HC).\nResting state functional MRI was acquired and the primary analysis compared the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) across groups. This informed a secondary analysis, in the PD groups only, comparing functional connectivity between a 'seed' region in the occipital lobe and the rest of the brain.\nIndividuals with PDVH showed lower ALFF in bilateral lingual gyrus and cuneus and greater ALFF in temporo-parietal regions, medial temporal gyrus and cerebellum than PDnonVH and HC. PDnonVH also had lower ALFF in occipitoparietal region and greater ALFF in medial temporal gyrus, temporo-parietal and cerebellum regions than HC. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that, although both PD groups had lower occipital functional connectivity relative to the HC group, occipital - corticostriatal connectivity was significantly higher in those with PDVH compared with PDnonVH.\nOur study reveals widespread hemodynamic alterations in PD. However, within a functionally abnormal occipital lobe, those with PDVH have even lower ALFF than non-hallucinators, but have higher occipital functional connectivity with cortical-striatal regions. These findings suggest disruption of pathways underpinning both primary visual perceptual and intrinsic visual integration may contribute to visual hallucinations in PD.",

However, within a functionally abnormal occipital lobe, those with PDVH have even lower ALFF than non-hallucinators, but have higher occipital functional connectivity with cortical-striatal regions. These findings suggest disruption of pathways underpinning both primary visual perceptual and intrinsic visual integration may contribute to visual hallucinations in PD.",

    "abstract": "Impulsive actions entail (1) capture of the motor system by an action impulse, which is an urge to act and (2) failed suppression of that impulse in order to prevent a response error. Several studies indicate that dopaminergic treatment can induce action impulsivity in patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD). Whether this effect is due to increased impulse expression or to decreased impulse suppression remains to be deciphered.\nWe used a novel approach based on electromyographic (EMG) analyses to decipher the effects of the patient's usual dopaminergic therapy on the expression and suppression of subliminal erroneous impulses. To this end, we used a within-subject design and took advantage of the Simon task, that elicits prepotent response tendencies. The patients (N\u2009=\u200915) performed the task on their usual dopaminergic medication and after complete medication withdrawal (for at least 12 h).\nThe correction rate that measures the ability to suppress subthreshold impulsive muscle activity was lower when the patients were on medication as compared to their off medication state (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The incorrect activation rate that measures the capture of the motor system by action impulses was unaffected by medication.\nDopa therapy affected action impulsivity. Although medication did not influence the incidence of fast action impulses, it significantly reduced patients' ability to abort and suppress muscle activation related to the incorrect response alternative.",

    "abstract": "Sporadic or idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder of unknown origin that ranks only second behind Alzheimer's disease (AD) in prevalence and its consequent social and economic burden. PD neuropathology is characterized by a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta; however, more widespread involvement of other CNS structures and peripheral tissues now is widely documented. The onset of molecular and cellular neuropathology of PD likely occurs decades before the onset of the motor symptoms characteristic of PD. The hallmark symptoms of PD, resting tremors, rigidity and postural disabilities, are related to dopamine (DA) deficiency. Current therapies treat these symptoms by replacing or boosting existing DA. All current interventions have limited therapeutic benefit for disease progression because damage likely has progressed over an estimated period of ~5 to 15years to a loss of 60%-80% of the nigral DA neurons, before symptoms emerge. There is no accepted definitive biomarker of PD. An urgent need exists to develop early diagnostic biomarkers for two reasons: (1) to intervene at the onset of disease and (2) to monitor the progress of therapeutic interventions that may slow or stop the course of the disease. In the context of disease development, one of the promises of personalized medicine is the ability to predict, on an individual basis, factors contributing to the susceptibility for the development of a given disease. Recent advances in our understanding of genetic factors underlying or contributing to PD offer the potential for monitoring susceptibility biomarkers that can be used to identify at-risk individuals and possibly prevent the onset of disease through treatment. Finally, the exposome concept is new in the biomarker discovery arena and it is suggested as a way to move forward in identifying biomarkers of neurological diseases. It is a two-stage scheme involving a first stage of exposome-wide association studies (EWAS) to profile omic features in serum to discover molecular biomarkers. The second stage involves application of this knowledge base in follow-up studies. This strategy is unique in that it promotes the use of data-driven (omic) strategies in interrogating diseased and healthy populations and encourages a movement away from using only reductionist strategies to discover biomarkers of exposure and disease. In this short review we will examine 1) advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PD that have led to candidate biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment efficacy and 2) new technologies on the horizon that will lead to novel approaches in biomarker development.",

We evaluated 171 patients, collecting demographic and clinical data, including standardized assessments with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), activities of daily living (ADL) and motor sections, modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale, Schwab and England, eight-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire, Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I), Berg Balance Scale, Dynamic Gait Index, Functional Reach, and Timed Up and Go. ROC curves were constructed to determine the cutoff scores for all measures. Variables with P < 0.1 entered a logistic regression model. The prevalence of recurrent falls was 30% (95% CI 24%-38%). In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for recurrent falls were (P < 0.05) levodopa equivalent dose (OR = 1.283 per 100\u2009mg increase; 95% CI = 1.092-1.507), UPDRS-ADL > 16 points (OR = 10.0; 95% CI = 3.6-28.3), FES-I > 30 points (OR = 6.0; 95% CI = 1.6-22.6), and Berg \u2264 48 points (OR = 3.9; 95% CI = 1.2-12.7).We encourage the utilization of these modifiable risk factors in the screening of fall risk.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with sleep disturbances, attributed to the neurodegenerative process and therapeutic drugs. Studies have found levodopa to increase wakefulness in some patients while increasing sleepiness in others.\nTo confirm sleep disturbances in drug na\u00efve PD patients and understand the impact of levodopa on their sleep.\nTwenty-three drug na\u00efve PD patients and 31 age-gender matched controls were compared using the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). A polysomnogram objectively compared sleep quality. Of the 23 patients, the 12 initiated on levodopa were reassessed subjectively and through polysomnography after 2 months of therapy.\nData was expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, median, and range. Continuous variables were analyzed by Student's T test for normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney U test for skewed data. Discrete variables were compared by Chi Square tests (Pearson Chi square Test or Fisher's Exact Test). Wilcoxon signed ranks test was applied in the analysis of paired data pre- and post-levodopa. A P value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Statistical analysis of the data was done using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 12.\nDrug na\u00efve PD patients had lower PDSS scores than controls. The sleep architecture changes observed on polysomnogram were reduced NREM Stage III and REM sleep and increased sleep latency and wake after sleep onset time. Following levodopa, improved sleep efficiency with reduced sleep latency and wake after sleep onset time was noted, coupled with improved PDSS scores. However, NREM Stage III and REM sleep duration did not increase.\nPD patients take longer to fall asleep and have difficulty in sleep maintenance. Sleep maintenance is affected by nocturia, REM behavioral disorder, nocturnal cramps, akinesia, and tremors, as observed in PDSS scores. Levodopa improves sleep efficiency by improving motor scores without altering sleep architecture.\nPoor sleep quality and sleep architecture changes occur secondary to the neurodegenerative process in PD patients. Though levodopa improves sleep quality by reducing rigidity and tremor, it does not reverse sleep architecture changes.",

    "abstract": "Movement Disorder Society-sponsored Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) has separate items for measuring sleep problems (item 1.7) and daytime sleepiness (1.8). The aim of our study was to evaluate the screening sensitivity and specificity of these items to the PD Sleep Scale 2nd version (PDSS-2) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). In this nationwide, cross-sectional study 460 PD patients were enrolled. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated between the individual items, domains, and the total score of PDSS-2 and item 1.7 of MDS-UPDRS. Similarly, the items and the total score of ESS were contrasted to item 1.8 of MDS-UPDRS. After developing generalized ordinal logistic regression models, the transformed and observed scores were compared by Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient. Only item 3 difficulties staying asleep and the \"disturbed sleep\" domain of PDSS-2 showed high correlation with \"sleep problems\" item 1.7 of the MDS-UPDRS. Total score of PDSS-2 had moderate correlation with this MDS-UPRDS item. The total score of ESS showed the strongest, but still moderate, correlation with \"daytime sleepiness\" item 1.8 of MDS-UPDRS. As intended, the MDS-UPDRS serves as an effective screening tool for both sleep problems and daytime sleepiness and identifies subjects whose disabilities need further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Background. It is known that ultra-low doses of haloperidol can cause dopamine supersensitivity of dopamine D2 receptors and related behaviour in animals. Objective. The objective was to determine whether a daily ultra-low dose of 40 micrograms of haloperidol could enhance the clinical action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease patients. Method. While continuing their daily treatment with levodopa, 16 patients with Parkinson's disease were followed weekly for six weeks. They received an add-on daily dose of 40 micrograms of haloperidol for the first two weeks only. The SPES/SCOPA scale (short scale for assessment of motor impairments and disabilities in Parkinson's disease) was administered before treatment and weekly throughout the trial. Results. The results showed a mean decrease in SPES/SCOPA scores after one week of the add-on treatment. Conclusion. SCOPA scores decreased after the addition of low-dose haloperidol to the standard daily levodopa dose. This finding is consistent with an increase in sensitivity of dopamine D2 receptors induced by haloperidol. Such treatment for Parkinson's disease may possibly permit the levodopa dose to be reduced and, thus, delay the onset of levodopa side effects.",

    "abstract": "Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson disease (PD) may be underutilized because of limited access to care (most DBS surgeries are performed at specialized centers) or over-referral of poor candidates, leading to inequitable utilization of limited evaluative resources. There is a pressing need for a widely employable screening algorithm to aid in the evaluation of PD candidates for DBS.\nTo compare the validity and efficacy of two published screening algorithms, the Florida Surgical Questionnaire for PD and Stimulus, to predict candidacy for DBS.\nWe reviewed the clinical data at our DBS center for 147 consecutive PD DBS referrals between 9/1/2007 and 12/31/2011. Florida Surgical Questionnaire and Stimulus scores were applied retrospectively through a chart review of the Movement Disorder neurologist's initial clinical evaluation. The validity and accuracy of these two algorithms in predicting candidacy for DBS was compared to the decision to offer DBS surgery by our multidisciplinary DBS team.\nOf the 130 consecutive PD referrals who presented for initial evaluation, 50 were offered DBS after a standardized multidisciplinary evaluation. The Stimulus scale was a superior screening tool for predicting PD DBS candidacy in these referrals [Area under the Receiver operating curve = 0.8088] compared to the Florida Surgical Questionnaire for PD [Area under the Receiver operating curve = 0.6285].\nIn this single center study, Stimulus was a more appropriate screening measure than the Florida Surgical Questionnaire for PD to assess DBS candidacy for PD.",

    "abstract": "Proprioceptive deficits negatively affect postural control but their precise contribution to postural instability in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unclear. We investigated if proprioceptive manipulations differentially affect balance, measured by force plates, during quiet standing in 13 PD patients and 13 age-matched controls with a history of falls. Perceived limits of stability (LoS) were derived from the differences between maximal center of pressure (CoP) displacement in anterior-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) direction during a maximal leaning task. Task conditions comprised standing with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC): (1) on a stable surface; (2) an unstable surface; and (3) with Achilles tendon vibration. CoP displacements were calculated as a percentage of their respective LoS. Perceived LoS did not differ between groups. PD patients showed greater ML CoP displacement than elderly fallers (EF) across all conditions (p\u2009=\u20090.043) and tended to have higher postural sway in relation to the LoS (p\u2009=\u20090.050). Both groups performed worse on an unstable surface and during tendon vibration compared to standing on a stable surface with EO and even more so with EC. Both PD and EF had more AP sway in all conditions with EC compared to EO (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and showed increased CoP displacements when relying on proprioception only compared to standing with normal sensory input. This implies a similar role of the proprioceptive system in postural control in fallers with and without PD. PD fallers showed higher ML sway after sensory manipulations, as a result of which these values approached their perceived LoS more closely than in EF. We conclude that despite a similar fall history, PD patients showed more ML instability than EF, irrespective of sensory manipulation, but had a similar reliance on ankle proprioception. Hence, we recommend that rehabilitation and fall prevention for PD should focus on motor rather than on sensory aspects.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the most common surgical treatment for managing motor complications in Parkinson's disease (PD). Ultimately, outcomes depend on a variety of factors including lead location, access and expertize in programming and PD medical management. Nevertheless, achieving ideal programming settings can be difficult in certain patients, leading to suboptimal control of symptoms and stimulation-induced side effects, notably dysarthria and dyskinesia. Interleaved stimulation (ILS) is a newer programming technique that attempts to optimize the stimulation field, improving control of symptoms while minimizing stimulation-induced adverse effects. A retrospective chart review was performed on PD patients receiving STN DBS over the past 12 months. Clinical and demographic data were collected from patients identified as having received ILS. The rationale and clinical efficacy of ILS was analyzed. Nine patients received ILS due to incomplete PD symptom control or stimulation-induced side effects after attempting multiple programming options. Appropriate lead location was confirmed with postoperative MRI except in one case. Following ILS, patients reported improvement in symptoms and resolution of side effects, while preserving adequate control in Parkinsonism with a mean improvement in UPDRS-MOTOR scores of 51.2 %. ILS continues to emerge as a safe and effective programming strategy for maximizing symptom control in PD while diminishing stimulation-induced side effects.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in a model of Parkinson's disease (PD) using serial F-18 fluoropropylcarbomethoxyiodophenylnortropane (FP-CIT) PET.\nHemiparkinsonian rats were treated with intravenously injected BMSCs, and animals without stem cell therapy were used as the controls. Serial FP-CIT PET was performed after therapy. The ratio of FP-CIT uptake in the lesion side to uptake in the normal side was measured. The changes in FP-CIT uptake were also analyzed using SPM. Behavioural and histological changes were observed using the rotational test and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-reactive cells.\nFP-CIT uptake ratio was significantly different in the BMSCs treated group (n\u2009=\u200928) at each time point. In contrast, there was no difference in the ratio in control rats (n\u2009=\u200925) at any time point. SPM analysis also revealed that dopamine transporter binding activity was enhanced in the right basal ganglia area in only the BMSC therapy group. In addition, rats that received BMSC therapy also exhibited significantly improved rotational behaviour and preservation of TH-positive neurons compared to controls.\nThe therapeutic effect of intravenously injected BMSCs in a rat model of PD was confirmed by dopamine transporter PET imaging, rotational functional studies, and histopathological evaluation.\n\u2022 Mesenchymal stem cells were intravenously injected to treat the PD rats \u2022 Dopamine transporter binding activity was improved after stem cell therapy \u2022 Stem cell therapy induced functional recovery and preservation of dopaminergic neurons \u2022 The effect of stem cells was confirmed by FP-CIT PET.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) can be divided into familial (Mendelian) and sporadic forms. A number of causal genes have been discovered for the Mendelian form, which constitutes 10-20% of the total cases. Genome-wide association studies have successfully uncovered a number of susceptibility loci for sporadic cases but those only explain a small fraction (6-7%) of PD heritability. It has been observed that some genes that confer susceptibility to PD through common risk variants also contain rare causing mutations for the Mendelian forms of the disease. These results suggest a possible functional link between Mendelian and sporadic PD and led us to investigate the role that rare and low-frequency variants could have on the sporadic form. Through a targeting approach, we have resequenced at 49\u00d7 coverage the exons and regulatory regions of 38 genes (including Mendelian and susceptibility PD genes) in 249 sporadic PD patients and 145 unrelated controls of European origin. Unlike susceptibility genes, Mendelian genes show a clear general enrichment of rare functional variants in PD cases, observed directly as well as with Tajima's D statistic and several collapsing methods. Our findings suggest that rare variation on PD Mendelian genes may have a role in the sporadic forms of the disease.",

    "abstract": "This review article considers the question of whether or not levodopa is toxic in Parkinson's disease (PD). l-dopa is the most effective symptomatic treatment for PD and has provided benefit for millions of patients. However, there has been a longstanding concern that l-dopa might be toxic and accelerate neuronal degeneration and clinical progression as a consequence of reactive oxygen species generated by the drug's oxidative metabolism. In vitro, l-dopa can induce degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, but it is not clear that the effects of the drug on cultured dopamine neurons reflect what happens in the PD brain. In vivo, l-dopa has not been demonstrated to have toxic effects on dopamine neurons in normal, dopamine-lesioned, or oxidatively stressed animal models, but none of these models precisely replicates the PD condition. Clinical trials have tested the effect of l-dopa on clinical progression and have not demonstrated any findings indicative of toxicity. However, the symptomatic and long-duration effects of the drug could mask ongoing neuronal degeneration. Furthermore, l-dopa induces a greater decline in imaging measures of dopaminergic function than placebo or dopamine agonists, consistent with toxicity. Pathological studies have not demonstrated evidence of accelerated loss of dopamine neurons, but prospective and properly controlled studies with stereological unbiased counting have not been performed. Thus, although there is no hard evidence to suggest that l-dopa is toxic in PD patients, the issue has not been fully resolved. It is generally recommended that physicians continue to use l-dopa, but in the lowest dose that provides satisfactory clinical control.",

    "abstract": "The recent emergence of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) as a contender in modifying neurotoxicity in human dopaminergic cells as well as its recognized anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory potentials in various hepatic pathologies raised impetus in investigating its anti-parkinsonian effect in rat rotenone model. UDCA prominently improved motor performance in the open field test and halted the decline in the striatal dopamine content. Meanwhile, it improved mitochondrial function as verified by elevation of ATP associated with preservation of mitochondrial integrity as portrayed in the electron microscope examination. In addition, through its anti-inflammatory potential, UDCA reduced the rotenone-induced nuclear factor-\u03baB expression and tumor necrosis factor alpha level. Furthermore, UDCA amended alterations in Bax and Bcl-2 and reduced the activities of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3, indicating that it suppressed rotenone-induced apoptosis via modulating both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. In conclusion, UDCA can be introduced as a novel approach for the management of Parkinson's disease via anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. These effects are probably linked to dopamine synthesis and mitochondrial regulation.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION. The cognitive disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) have traditionally been associated with the presence of dementia in later stages of the disease. Recent studies, however, consider that cognitive impairment can appear as of early stages. Knowing the cognitive profile of PD furthers our understanding of the clinical phenotype, making it easier to reach a timely diagnosis and favouring intervention on the symptoms from the initial stages. AIM. To present a review of the literature on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia associated with PD. DEVELOPMENT. Several studies report that patients with PD who have a prolonged time to progression develop dementia. Yet, there have also been reports claiming that, as of the early stages, patients can present subtle cognitive alterations known as MCI. The initial neuropsychological profile is mainly of a non-amnesic type, characterised by executive dysfunction, alterations affecting attention, operative memory deficit and faulty retrieval of information. When patients develop dementia, disorders will arise in the storage of information, in semantic fluency, and in visuospatial and visuoperceptual skills. Currently there are criteria available for diagnosing the MCI and dementia associated with PD, as well as valid reliable instruments for detecting those disorders. CONCLUSIONS. Cognitive symptoms are frequent in PD. From the initial stages of the disease onwards patients may present MCI that is mainly characterised by a fronto-subcortical cognitive profile, whereas dementia usually develops at later stages, when a pattern of posterior cortical cognitive disorder is also observed.\nDemencia y deterioro cognitivo leve en la enfermedad de Parkinson: una revision.\nIntroduccion. Clasicamente, las alteraciones cognitivas en la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) se han asociado a la presencia de demencia en etapas tardias de la enfermedad; sin embargo, estudios recientes consideran que el deterioro cognitivo puede aparecer desde etapas tempranas. Conocer el perfil cognitivo de la EP contribuye a la comprension del fenotipo clinico, facilita el diagnostico oportuno y favorece la intervencion de los sintomas desde estadios iniciales. Objetivo. Presentar una revision de la bibliografia del deterioro cognitivo leve (DCL) y demencia asociados a la EP. Desarrollo. Diversos estudios indican que los pacientes con EP que tienen un tiempo de evolucion prolongado de la enfermedad desarrollan demencia. Sin embargo, tambien se ha descrito que, desde etapas tempranas, los pacientes pueden presentar sutiles alteraciones cognitivas conocidas como DCL; el perfil neuropsicologico inicial es principalmente de tipo no amnesico, caracterizado por disfuncion ejecutiva, alteraciones atencionales, deficit de la memoria operativa y fallas en la recuperacion de la informacion. Cuando los pacientes desarrollan demencia, surgen alteraciones en el almacenamiento de la informacion, en la fluidez semantica y en las habilidades visuoespaciales y visuoperceptuales. En la actualidad, existen criterios disponibles para el diagnostico de DCL y demencia asociados a la EP, e instrumentos validos y fiables para la deteccion de dichas alteraciones. Conclusiones. Los sintomas cognitivos son frecuentes en la EP; desde las etapas iniciales de la enfermedad, los pacientes pueden presentar DCL caracterizado principalmente por un perfil cognitivo frontosubcortical, mientras que la demencia suele desarrollarse en etapas tardias, cuando se a\u00f1ade un patron de alteracion cognitiva cortical posterior.",

    "abstract": "Auditory musical hallucinations (AMHs) are rare complex auditory hallucinations in Parkinson's disease (PD) that have been limited previously. The characteristics of AMHs in PD remain uncertain. We describe a 72-year-old woman with PD who presented with AMHs. The AMHs occurred after immediate-release pramipexole was switched to extended-release pramipexole. The AMHs were a quiet piano or often songs on a loud radio or background music over other sounds. The music was unpleasant, but not objectionable, threatening, or ego-syntonic, and it did not interrupt her daily activities. AMHs in PD were non-threatening, and dopaminergic treatment may predispose patients to AMHs or be a unique possible cause of AMHs. The hallucinations can occur after immediate-release pramipexole was switched to extended-release pramipexole.",

    "abstract": "Brain single-photon-emission-computerized tomography (SPECT) with I-ioflupane (I-FP-CIT) is useful to diagnose Parkinson disease (PD). To investigate the diagnostic performance of I-FP-CIT brain SPECT with semiquantitative analysis by Basal Ganglia V2 software (BasGan), we evaluated semiquantitative data of patients with suspect of PD by a support vector machine classifier (SVM), a powerful supervised classification algorithm.I-FP-CIT SPECT with BasGan analysis was performed in 90 patients with suspect of PD showing mild symptoms (bradykinesia-rigidity and mild tremor). PD was confirmed in 56 patients, 34 resulted non-PD (essential tremor and drug-induced Parkinsonism). A clinical follow-up of at least 6 months confirmed diagnosis. To investigate BasGan diagnostic performance we trained SVM classification models featuring different descriptors using both a \"leave-one-out\" and a \"five-fold\" method. In the first study we used as class descriptors the semiquantitative radiopharmaceutical uptake values in the left (L) and right (R) putamen (P) and in the L and R caudate nucleus (C) for a total of 4 descriptors (CL, CR, PL, PR). In the second study each patient was described only by CL and CR, while in the third by PL and PR descriptors. Age was added as a further descriptor to evaluate its influence in the classification performance.I-FP-CIT SPECT with BasGan analysis reached a classification performance higher than 73.9% in all the models. Considering the \"Leave-one-out\" method, PL and PR were better predictors (accuracy of 91% for all patients) than CL and CR descriptors; using PL, PR, CL, and CR diagnostic accuracy was similar to that of PL and PR descriptors in the different groups. Adding age as a further descriptor accuracy improved in all the models. The best results were obtained by using all the 5 descriptors both in PD and non-PD subjects (CR and CL\u200a+\u200aPR and PL + age = 96.4% and 94.1%, respectively). Similar results were observed for the \"five-fold\" method. I-FP-CIT SPECT with BasGan analysis using SVM classifier was able to diagnose PD. Putamen was the most discriminative descriptor for PD and the patient age influenced the classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic degeneration is a major finding in brains of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), together with Lewy bodies, intraneuronal inclusions mainly composed of the fibrillogenic protein \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn). The familial-PD-related protein DJ-1 was reported to reduce dopaminergic degeneration triggered by \u03b1-syn or by the dopaminergic-selective neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA).\nThe aim was to further investigate the role of DJ-1 in dopaminergic degeneration and to see whether a cell-permeable recombinant form of DJ-1 (TAT-DJ-1) could restore dopamine depletion in vivo, thus representing an innovative therapeutic approach.\nWe developed in vitro (PC12/TetOn cells and mouse primary mesencephalic neurons) and in vivo models [including DJ-1 knockout (-/-) mice] to investigate DJ-1 in dopaminergic degeneration.\nWe found that in PC12/TetOn cells overexpressing \u03b1-syn with the familial-PD linked mutation A30P, DJ-1 silencing increased \u03b1-syn (A30P) toxicity. Primary mesencephalic neurons from DJ-1 (-/-) mice were more vulnerable to a cell-permeable form of \u03b1-syn (TAT-\u03b1-syn) and to 6-OHDA. Intrastriatally administered TAT-DJ-1 reduced 6-OHDA toxicity in vivo in C57BL/6 mice. Finally, when we injected TAT-\u03b1-syn (A30P) in the striatum of DJ-1 (-/-) animals, dopamine was depleted more than in the control strain.\nDJ-1 appears to have a protective role against dopaminergic degeneration triggered by \u03b1-syn or 6-OHDA, reinforcing the possible therapeutic importance of this protein in PD.",

Non-clinical researchers and employees of pharmaceutical or medical devices companies were excluded. 1000 participants (60% PwP) provided ideas on research uncertainties, 475 (72% PwP) initially prioritised them and 27 (37% PwP) stakeholders agreed a final top 10.\nUsing a modified nominal group technique, participants were surveyed to identify what issues for the management of PD needed research. Unique research questions unanswered by current evidence were identified and participants were asked to identify their top 10 research priorities from this list. The top 26 uncertainties were presented to a consensus meeting with key stakeholders to agree the top 10 research priorities.\n1000 participants provided 4100 responses, which contained 94 unique unanswered research questions that were initially prioritised by 475 participants. A consensus meeting with 27 stakeholders agreed the top 10 research priorities. The overarching research aspiration was an effective cure for PD. The top 10 research priorities for PD management included the need to address motor symptoms (balance and falls, and fine motor control), non-motor symptoms (sleep and urinary dysfunction), mental health issues (stress and anxiety, dementia and mild cognitive impairments), side effects of medications (dyskinesia) and the need to develop interventions specific to the phenotypes of PD and better monitoring methods.\nThese research priorities identify crucial gaps in the existing evidence to address everyday practicalities in the management of the complexities of PD.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we have designed and synthesized a novel multipotent, brain-permeable iron-chelating drug, VAR10303 (VAR), possessing both propargyl and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory moieties. The present study was undertaken to determine the multiple pharmacological activities of VAR in neurodegenerative preclinical models. We demonstrate that VAR affords iron chelating/iron-induced lipid-peroxidation inhibitory potency and brain selective MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitory effects, with only limited tyramine-cardiovascular potentiation of blood pressure. The results show that in 6-hydroxydopamine rat (neuroprotection) and in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse (neurorescue) Parkinson's disease models, VAR significantly attenuated the loss of striatal dopamine levels, markedly reduced dopamine turnover, and increased tyrosine-hydroxylase levels. Furthermore, chronic systemic treatment of aged rats with VAR improved cognitive behavior deficits and enhanced the expression levels of neurotrophic factors (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, and nerve growth factor), Bcl-2 family members and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Our study indicates that the multitarget compound VAR exerted neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects in animal models of Parkinson's disease and aging, further suggesting that a drug that can regulate multiple brain targets could be an ideal treatment-strategy for age-associated neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Degeneration of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons is a key pathological change of Parkinson's disease (PD), and its motor consequences have been widely recognized. Recently, mood disorders associated with PD have begun to attract a great deal of interest, however, their pathogenesis remains unclear. PD is associated with not only degenerative changes in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra but also changes in serotonergic neurons in the raphe nuclei. The abnormalities in central 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurotransmission are thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of depression. The lateral habenula (LHb) is closely related to the substantia nigra and raphe nuclei, and its hyperactivity is closely related to the pathogenesis of depression. In this study, we screened rats with depressive-like behaviors from PD model animals and found that cytochrome c oxidase activity in the LHb of these rats was twice that seen in the control rats. In the forced swim test, LHb lesions caused a decrease in depressive-like behavior of PD rats as indexed by decreased immobility times and increased climbing times. Additionally, LHb lesions caused an enhance in 5-HT levels in the raphe nuclei. These results suggest that LHb lesions may improve depressive-like behavior in PD rats by increasing 5-HT levels in the raphe nuclei. Thus, LHb contributes to the depressive-like behavior in PD rats via mediating the effects of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra on serotonergic neurons in the raphe nuclei.",

    "abstract": "Glutamatergic hyperactivity plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Ceftriaxone increases expression of glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) and affords neuroprotection. This study was aimed at clarifying whether ceftriaxone prevented, or reversed, behavioral and neuronal deficits in an 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD rat model. Male Wistar rats were injected daily with either ceftriaxone starting 5 days before or 3 days after MPTP lesioning (day 0) or saline and underwent a bar-test on days 1-7, a T-maze test on days 9-11, and an object recognition test on days 12-14, then the brains were taken for histological evaluation on day 15. Dopaminergic degeneration in the substantia nigra pars compacta and striatum was observed on days 3 and 15. Motor dysfunction in the bar test was observed on day 1, but disappeared by day 7. In addition, lesioning resulted in deficits in working memory in the T-maze test and in object recognition in the object recognition task, but these were not observed in rats treated pre- or post-lesioning with ceftriaxone. Lesioning also caused neurodegeneration in the hippocampal CA1 area and induced glutamatergic hyperactivity in the subthalamic nucleus, and both changes were suppressed by ceftriaxone. Increased GLT-1 expression and its co-localization with astrocytes were observed in the striatum and hippocampus in the ceftriaxone-treated animals. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing a relationship between ceftriaxone-induced GLT-1 expression, neuroprotection, and improved cognition in a PD rat model. Ceftriaxone may have clinical potential for the prevention and treatment of dementia associated with PD.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) with symptom onset on the left side of the body (LPD) show a mild type of left-sided visuospatial neglect, whereas those with right-onset (RPD) generally do not. The functional mechanisms underlying these observations are unknown. Two hypotheses are that the representation of left-space in LPD is either compressed or reduced in salience. We tested these hypotheses psychophysically. Participants were 31 non-demented adults with PD (15 LPD, 16 RPD) and 17 normal control adults (NC). The spatial compression hypothesis was tested by showing two sinusoidal gratings, side by side. One grating's spatial frequency (SF) was varied across trials, following a staircase procedure, whereas the comparison grating was held at a constant SF. While fixating on a central target, participants estimated the point at which they perceived the two gratings to be equal in SF. The reduced salience hypothesis was tested in a similar way, but by manipulating the contrast of the test grating rather than its SF. There were no significant differences between groups in the degree of bias across hemifields for SF discrimination or for contrast discrimination. Results did not support either the spatial compression hypothesis or the reduced salience hypothesis. Instead, they suggest that at this perceptual level, LPD do not have a systematically biased way of representing space in the left hemifield that differs from healthy individuals, nor do they perceive stimuli on the left as less salient than stimuli on the right. Neglect-like syndrome in LPD instead presumably arises from dysfunction of higher-order attention.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is not only characterized by motor disturbances but also, by cognitive, sensory, psychiatric and autonomic dysfunction. It has been proposed that some of these symptoms might be related to the widespread pathology of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregation in different nuclei of the central and peripheral nervous system. However, the pathogenic formation of \u03b1-syn aggregates in different brain areas of PD patients is poorly understood. Most experimental models of PD are valuable to assess specific aspects of its pathogenesis, such as toxin-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. However, new models are required that reflect the widespread and progressive formation of \u03b1-syn aggregates in different brain areas. Such \u03b1-syn aggregation is induced in only a few animal models, for example perikaryon inclusions are found in rats administered rotenone, aggregates with a neuritic morphology develop in mice overexpressing either mutated or wild-type \u03b1-syn, and in Smad3 deficient mice, aggregates form extensively in the perikaryon and neurites of specific brain nuclei. In this review we focus on \u03b1-syn aggregation in the human disorder, its genetics and the availability of experimental models. Indeed, evidences show that dopamine (DA) metabolism may be related to \u03b1-syn and its conformational plasticity, suggesting an interesting link between the two pathological hallmarks of PD: dopaminergic neurodegeneration and Lewy body (LB) formation.",

    "abstract": "The Mini-BESTest is a clinical balance test that has shown a high sensitivity in detecting balance impairments in elderly with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, its reproducibility between different raters and between test occasions has yet to be investigated in a clinical context. Moreover, no one has investigated the reproducibility of the Mini-BESTest's subcomponents (i.e. anticipatory postural adjustments; postural responses; sensory orientation and dynamic gait). We aimed to investigate the inter-rater and test-retest reproducibility (reliability as well as agreement) of the Mini-BESTest, as well as its subcomponents, in elderly with mild to moderate PD, performed under conditions assimilating clinical practice.\nThis was an observational measurement study with a test-retest design. Twenty-seven individuals with idiopathic PD (66 - 80 years, mean age: 73; Hoehn & Yahr: 2-3; 1-15 years since diagnosis) were included. Two test administrators, having different experiences with the Mini-BESTest, administered the test individually, in separate rooms in a hospital setting. For the test-retest assessment, all participants returned 7 days after the first test session to perform the Mini-BESTest under similar conditions. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC2.1), standard error of measurement (SEMagreement), and smallest real difference (SRD) were analyzed.\nThe Mini-BESTest showed good reliability for both inter-rater and test-retest reproducibility (ICC = 0.72 and 0.80). Regarding agreement, the measurement error (SRD) was found to be 4.1 points (accounting for 15% of the maximal total score) for inter-rater reproducibility and 3.4 points (12% of the maximal total score) for test-retest reproducibility. The investigation of the Mini-BESTest's subcomponents showed a similar pattern for both inter-rater and test-retest reproducibility, where postural responses had the largest proportional measurement error, and sensory orientation showed the highest agreement.\nOur findings indicate that the Mini-BESTest is able to distinguish between individuals with mild to moderate PD; however, when used in clinical balance assessments, the large measurement error needs to be accounted for.",

    "abstract": "The pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is not confined to the nigrostriatal pathway, but also involves widespread cerebral cortical areas. Using seed-based resting state functional connectivity, many previous studies have demonstrated that PD patients have abnormal functional integration. However, this technique strongly relies on a priori selection of the seed regions and may miss important unpredictable findings. Using an ultrafast voxel-wise functional connectivity density approach, this study performed a whole brain functional connectivity analysis to investigate the abnormal resting-state functional activities in PD patients. Compared with healthy controls, PD patients exhibited decreased short-range functional connectivity densities in regions that were mainly located in the ventral visual pathway and decreased long-range functional connectivity densities in the right middle and superior frontal gyrus, which have been speculated to be associated with visual hallucinations and cognitive dysfunction, respectively. PD patients also exhibited increased short- and long-range functional connectivity densities in the bilateral precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, which may represent a compensatory process for maintaining normal brain function. The observed functional connectivity density alterations might be related to the disturbed structural connectivity of PD patients, leading to abnormal functional integration. Our results suggest that functional connectivity density mapping may provide a useful means to assess PD-related neurodegeneration and to study the pathophysiology of PD.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor Nrf2, encoded by the NFE2L2 gene, is an important regulator of the cellular protection against oxidative stress. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease highly associated with oxidative stress. In a previously published study, we reported associations of NFE2L2 haplotypes with risk and age at onset of idiopathic Parkinson's disease in a Swedish discovery material and a Polish replication material. Here, we have extended the replication study and performed meta-analyses including the Polish material and four new independent European patient-control materials. Furthermore, all SNPs included in the haplotype windows were investigated individually for associations with Parkinson's disease in meta-analyses including all six materials.\nTotally 1038 patients and 1600 control subjects were studied. Based on previous NFE2L2 haplotype associations with Parkinson's disease, five NFE2L2 tag SNPs were genotyped by allelic discrimination and three functional NFE2L2 promoter SNPs were genotyped by sequencing. The impact of individual SNPs and haplotypes on risk and age at onset of Parkinson's disease were investigated in each material individually and in meta-analyses of the obtained results.\nMeta-analyses of NFE2L2 haplotypes showed association of haplotype GAGCAAAA, including the fully functional promoter haplotype AGC, with decreased risk (OR\u2009=\u20090.8 per allele, p\u2009=\u20090.012) and delayed onset (+1.1 years per allele, p\u2009=\u20090.048) of Parkinson's disease. These results support the previously observed protective effect of this haplotype in the first study. Further, meta-analyses of the SNPs included in the haplotypes revealed four NFE2L2 SNPs associated with age at onset of Parkinson's disease (rs7557529 G\u2009>\u2009A, -1.0 years per allele, p\u2009=\u20090.042; rs35652124 A\u2009>\u2009G, -1.1 years per allele, p\u2009=\u20090.045; rs2886161 A\u2009>\u2009G, -1.2 years per allele, p\u2009=\u20090.021; rs1806649 G\u2009>\u2009A, +1.2 years per allele, p\u2009=\u20090.029). One of these (rs35652124) is a functional SNP located in the NFE2L2 promoter. No individual SNP was associated with risk of Parkinson's disease.\nOur results support the hypothesis that variation in the NFE2L2 gene, encoding a central protein in the cellular protection against oxidative stress, may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Functional studies are now needed to explore these results further.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the subjective cognitive complaints of individuals with Parkinson disease (PD). Such complaints have become a topic of interest recently as they play a role in the diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders. The aim of this preliminary study was to determine whether a sample of nondemented individuals with PD reported significantly more difficulties with multiple elements of cognition than a control sample and to assess the relation between their ratings and demographics, motor symptom severity, neuropsychological test performance, and measures of depression and anxiety. Forty nondemented individuals with PD and 27 healthy individuals completed a questionnaire assessing everyday cognitive difficulties. Independent t tests indicated that individuals with PD reported significantly more cognitive complaints in general and in specific tasks involving complex attention, executive function, processing speed, and verbal fluency but not memory. Questionnaire ratings significantly correlated with measures assessing anxiety, verbal memory, processing speed, and verbal fluency. Results suggest that it is important to ask individuals with PD about cognitive complaints across several cognitive domains and also inquire about symptoms of anxiety, which may be related to their self-reported cognitive difficulties.",

    "abstract": "Long-term safety of once-daily ropinirole extended/prolonged release (ropinirole XL/PR) was evaluated in subjects with early and advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) in this study, 101468/248. Subjects (n = 419) who completed one of three prior studies evaluating ropinirole XL/PR for the treatment of PD were enrolled in this open-label, multicenter, extension study, and were to be followed for up to 73 months. Ropinirole XL/PR was titrated/continued, and adjusted as appropriate during the maintenance phase (maximum 24\u00a0mg/d). Levodopa (L-dopa) and other nondopamine agonist PD medications were permitted. Safety outcomes that were investigated included frequency of adverse events (AEs). Subjects' preference regarding once daily versus three times daily study medication regimens was also investigated in a subset of the study population. The median duration of ropinirole XL/PR exposure was 1275 d. Most subjects (87%) reported at least one AE, with the most common (\u2265\u00a010%) AEs being, back pain (14%), hallucinations (13%), somnolence (11%) and peripheral edema (11%). Twenty-five percent of subjects discontinued the study prematurely due to an AE during the treatment period. Long-term treatment with ropinirole XL/PR was not associated with any new or unexpected safety concerns in patients with early and advanced PD, and a majority of subjects preferred the once-daily dosing regimen.",

    "abstract": "Prior research has shown that individuals with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) show a different pattern of error types on everyday tasks compared with individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study evaluated whether these groups would respond differently to cues designed to remind participants of task goals and improve performance of everyday tasks (i.e., goal cues).\nParticipants with PDD (n = 20) and AD (n = 20), and a comparison group of individuals with Parkinson's disease and no dementia (n = 20), were administered performance-based tasks of everyday functioning that allowed for the quantification of errors before and after the presentation of goal cues.\nAD participants showed a significantly greater response to the goal cues as compared with individuals with PDD. The goal cues facilitated the completion of task goals but did not promote error correction (i.e., the undoing of errors that had been made earlier during the task).\nNot all dementia patients respond similarly to cues designed to improve everyday functioning. Understanding patients' specific form of everyday action impairment is crucial for developing individualized interventions that target specific functional deficits.",

    "abstract": "Expression patterns of the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA) were studied across anatomy, development, and disease to better characterize its role in the brain. In this postmortem study, negative spatial co-expression between SNCA and 73 interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) signaling genes was observed across many brain regions. Recent animal studies have demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 induces loss of dopamine neurons and nigrostriatal degeneration. This opposing pattern between SNCA and IFN-\u03b3 signaling genes increases with age (rho\u200a=\u200a-0.78). In contrast, a meta-analysis of four microarray experiments representing 126 substantia nigra samples reveals a switch to positive co-expression in Parkinson's disease (p<0.005). Use of genome-wide testing demonstrates this relationship is specific to SNCA (p<0.002). This change in co-expression suggests an immunomodulatory role of SNCA that may provide insight into neurodegeneration. Genes showing similar co-expression patterns have been previously linked to Alzheimer's (ANK1) and Parkinson's disease (UBE2E2, PCMT1, HPRT1 and RIT2).",

    "abstract": "The aim was to examine the effect of dopaminergic medication on stimulus-response learning versus performing decisions based on learning.\nTo see the effect of dopaminergic therapy on stimulus-response learning and response selection, participants with Parkinson's disease (PD) were either tested on and/or off their prescribed dose of dopaminergic therapy during different testing days. Forty participants with PD and 34 healthy controls completed the experiment on consecutive days. On Day 1, participants learned to associate abstract images with spoken, \"right\" or \"left\" responses via feedback (Session 1). On Day 2, participants recalled these responses (Session 2) and indicated the location (i.e., right or left of center) of previously studied images intermixed with new images (Session 3).\nParticipants with PD off medication learned stimulus-response associations equally well compared to healthy controls. Learning was impaired by dopaminergic medication. Regardless of medication status, patients recalled the stimulus-response associations from Day 1 as well as controls. In Session 3 off medication, patients demonstrated enhanced facilitation relative to controls and patients on medication, when the stimulus location was congruent with the spoken response that was learned for the stimulus in Session 1.\nLearning in PD was comparable to that of healthy controls off medication. Learning was worsened by dopaminergic therapy in PD. We interpret greater facilitation in participants with PD off medication for congruent responses as evidence of greater impulsivity. This motor or reflexive impulsivity was normalized by medication in PD. These findings shed light on the cognitive profile of PD and have implications for dopaminergic treatment.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for severe Parkinson's disease (PD) outperforms the best medical treatment in controlling motor symptoms and improving quality of life. Nevertheless disease progression cannot be controlled, and the development of dementia over time is nearly inevitable, often resulting in nursing home placement. Ten-year survival, development of hallucinations, dementia and nursing home placement were examined and adverse events were assessed.\nPatient files were scrutinized from baseline up to 10 years of treatment or death on all 79 PD patients treated with DBS of the subthalamic nucleus from 1998 to 2003 at Aarhus University Hospital.\nTwenty-four patients died during the follow-up period of 10 years. Age above 60 years at surgery increased mortality 2.3-fold (P = 0.04). Of the 55 surviving patients 29 (53%) were demented and 19 (35%) were in nursing homes. Average time from operation to dementia was 5.6 \u00b1 2.9 years. Hallucinations and nursing home placement were associated with increased mortality.\nSurvival of 70% after a mean of 25 years of PD including 10 years with DBS illustrates that this is a selected group of PD patients. The prevalence of dementia steadily increased after surgery as expected from disease progression and can be an early event. Compared with the few similar long-term studies, the present study presents a larger cohort followed at the same DBS center for a longer period of time and none was lost to follow-up, making conclusions more valid. The present findings are of significant prognostic help for the patient, caregiver and physician when treatment with DBS has to be decided.",

    "abstract": "It took exactly 150 years since James Parkinson's description in 1817 of the illness bearing his name until the development of effective therapy for this disorder, namely, the introduction of high-dosage levodopa by George Cotzias in 1967. During the first 50 years, no effective therapy was available, but neurologists reported using different agents, including metals. Then, around 1867, Charcot found solanaceous alkaloids to be somewhat helpful, and these became the accepted and popular therapy for the next 75 years. When basic scientists discovered that these alkaloids had central antimuscarinic activity, pharmaceutical chemists developed synthetic chemical agents that were equally effective, with possibly less adverse effects, and around 1950 these synthetic drugs became the standard medical therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). The link between dopamine and PD did not take place until 1957, 140 years after Parkinson's Essay. The clue came from research on reserpine, a drug derived from the Rauwolfia plant that caused a sedative effect, now recognized as a drug-induced parkinsonian state. Initial investigations revealed that reserpine caused the release and depletion of serotonin stores in the brain. With that knowledge, Arvid Carlsson, a young pharmacologist in Sweden, decided to explore the possibility that reserpine might also affect brain catecholamines. In his now famous, elegant, and simple experiment, he showed that injecting l-dopa, the precursor of catecholamines, alleviated the reserpine-induced parkinsonian state in animals, whereas the precursor of serotonin failed to do so. Carlsson then developed a highly sensitive assay to measure dopamine, and his lab found that dopamine is selectively present in high concentrations in the striatum and that administered l-dopa could restore the dopamine depleted by reserpine. Carlsson postulated that all these findings implicate dopamine in motor disorders. Oleh Hornykiewicz, a young pharmacologist in Vienna, on being aware of the regional localization of brain dopamine, decided to measure it in the brains of people who had PD and postencephalitic parkinsonism. In 1960, he reported finding markedly depleted dopamine in the striatum in these conditions. Immediately after, Hornykiewicz teamed up with the geriatrician, Walther Birkmayer, to inject small doses of l-dopa intravenously (IV) into PD patients. They found benefit and pursued this treatment, but the gastrointestinal side effects limited the dosage, and many neurologists were doubtful that the effects from l-dopa were any better than those with antimuscarinic agents. A number of neurologists tested such low doses of IV l-dopa and even higher oral dosages, but without showing any dramatic benefit, not better than the antimuscarinics. Some of these studies were small, controlled trials. This general lack of efficacy with l-dopa prevailed, and neurologists were discouraged about l-dopa until 1967, when George C. Cotzias, a neuropharmacologist in New York, reported his results. He thought that PD may be result from the loss of neuromelanin in the substantia nigra, and he decided to try to replenish the depleted neuromelanin. Among the agents he tried was dl-dopa. He wisely began with low oral doses and increased the dosage slowly and steadily, thereby limiting the gastrointestinal complication. He also treated his patients for a long duration, months in a government-supported hospital. In the accompanying videotape of an interview Cotzias gave in 1970, he describes much of his success to be able to observe his patients over months while building up the dosage very slowly and observe for signs of toxicity. When higher doses, usually over 12 g/day, were reached, dramatic antiparkinsonian effects were observed, and a revolutionary new treatment for PD was established.",

    "abstract": "Tanshinone IIA is one of the major constituents of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge known as Danshen. Recent reports have shown that Tanshinone IIA has neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and traumatic injury of the spinal cord in rats. However, whether Tanshinone IIA has any neuroprotective effect in Parkinson's disease remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated whether Tanshinone IIA promotes the survival of nigrostriatal dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease. MPTP induced degeneration of nigrostriatal DA neurons and microglial activation as visualized by tyrosine hydroxylase and CD11b immunoreactivity. The results of Western blot and immunohistochemistry showed upregulation of NADPH oxidase and iNOS in the MPTP-treated substantia nigra pars compacta. Treatment with Tanshinone IIA prevented degeneration of nigrostriatal DA neurons and increased the level of striatal dopamine content. This neuroprotection afforded by Tanshinone IIA was associated with the suppression of microglial activation and reduced expression of NADPH oxidase and iNOS. The present findings show that Tanshinone IIA may possess anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties and may have therapeutic value in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), a wide range of non-motor symptoms (NMS) are evident. We assessed markers of NMS and explored their behavioral correlates with the tremor-dominant (TD) and postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) subtypes. 110 non-demented patients with PD were evaluated and stratified into the PIGD and TD subtypes and, using stricter criteria, into predominant subgroups: p-PIGD (n = 31) and p-TD (n = 32). Non-motor signs that were assessed included cognitive function (pen and paper and a computerized battery), autonomic function (NMSQest and SCOPA-AUT), mood, and sleep. Health-related quality of life was evaluated using the PDQ-39. The p-PIGD subgroup had a higher score on the NMSQest (p = 0.033) and a higher score (i.e., worse) on the PDQ-39 (p-PIGD: 26.28 \u00b1 12.47; p-TD: 16.93 \u00b1 12.22; p = 0.004), compared to the p-TD subgroup, while these measures did not differ in the larger PIGD and TD group. The p-PIGD subgroup used more sleep medications compared to the p-TD subgroup (1.0 \u00b1 1.39 vs. 0.41 \u00b1 0.94, p = 0.05, respectively). Most cognitive scores were similar in both subgroups; however, the visuospatial components of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the computerized catch game were significantly worse among the p-PIGD subgroup. Mild associations were found between certain non-motor symptoms, but not cognitive function, and the PIGD score. Non-demented patients from the PIGD subtype experience more non-motor symptoms and poorer quality of life compared to the TD subtype. These findings suggest that the clinical management of non-motor and motor symptoms in patients with PD may be enhanced by a personalized approach.",

    "abstract": "A relatively new strategy in drug discovery is the development of dual acting ligands. These molecules are potentially able to interact at two orthosteric binding sites of a heterodimer simultaneously, possibly resulting in enhanced subtype selectivity, higher affinity, enhanced or modified physiological response, and reduced reliance on multiple drug administration regimens. In this study, we have successfully synthesized a series of classical heterobivalent ligands as well as a series of more integrated and \"drug-like\" dual acting molecules, incorporating ropinirole as a dopamine D2 receptor agonist and ZM 241385 as an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist. The best compounds of our series maintained the potency of the original pharmacophores at both receptors (adenosine A2A and dopamine D2). In addition, the integrated dual acting ligands also showed promising results in preliminary blood-brain barrier permeability tests, whereas the classical heterobivalent ligands are potentially more suited as pharmacological tools.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents REMPARK system, a novel approach to deal with Parkinson's Disease (PD). REMPARK system comprises two closed loops of actuation onto PD. The first loop consists in a wearable system that, based on a belt-worn movement sensor, detects movement alterations that activate an auditory cueing system controlled by a smartphone in order to improve patient's gait. The belt-worn sensor analyzes patient's movement through real-time learning algorithms that were developed on the basis of a database previously collected from 93 PD patients. The second loop consists in disease management based on the data collected during long periods and that enables neurologists to tailor medication of their PD patients and follow the disease evolution. REMPARK system is going to be tested in 40 PD patients in Spain, Ireland, Italy and Israel. This paper describes the approach followed to obtain this system, its components, functionalities and trials in which the system will be validated.",

The particular features and brain functional patterns of the Parkinson's disease cause that there are regions that conveniently reveal the presence of the pathology, in this case mainly the striatum region. The selection of the brain mask makes incidence in two main aspects: the selection of the region of interest (striatum and surrounding area) for the analysis, but also the selection of the region without significance, which is the reference area for the intensity normalization, previous to the analysis. This work studies the statistical significance in the selection of ROIs in 3D brain images for Parkinson, depending on the objective to be achieved in the posterior analysis process.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) were found to be a significant cause of late-onset autosomal dominant forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). To determine the motor characteristics of LRRK2-related disease, we conducted a longitudinal study of 58 G2019S LRRK2-associated PD patients and compared them with genetically undefined (GU) PD patients. Fifty-eight patients diagnosed with PD-related LRRK2 G2019S mutation were included in the study and compared with 54 sporadic PD patients with negative tests for LRRK2 G2019S, PINK1, SNCA, PRKN, and DJ1 mutations. Patients were assessed at baseline and after a follow-up period of 6 years. The Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), the Hoehn and Yahr, and the Schwab and England scores were determined. Logistic regression was used to examine associations of G2019S mutation status with motor phenotype and rate of motor decline. The LRRK2-associated PD patients had a mean age of onset of 56.25\u2009\u00b1\u200912.05 years and in most cases (58.6%) a postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) phenotype. The mean annual decline in the MDS-UDRS III motor score and the Hoehn and Yahr staging was of 1.3% and 2%, respectively. The PIGD phenotype predicted a more rapid progression of motor impairment. The PD motor phenotype and motor scores were similar in the LRRK2-associated PD group and in the GU PD group, with no significant differences in the progression rate of motor impairment. Motor phenotype seems to be similar in LRRK2-related PD and idiopathic PD.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) results from failure of norepinephrine responses to postural change to maintain standing systolic blood pressure (s-SBP). Droxidopa is an oral prodrug of norepinephrine. Study nOH306 enrolled patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and symptomatic nOH. Subjects underwent up to 2 weeks of double-blind titration of droxidopa or placebo, followed by 8 weeks of double-blind maintenance treatment (100-600 mg thrice-daily). For the initial 51 subjects (study nOH306A, previously reported), the primary efficacy measure, Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ) composite score, did not demonstrate significant change versus placebo at maintenance week 8. For the subsequent 171 subjects (study nOH306B, reported here), the primary efficacy measure was change versus placebo on item 1 (\"dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling like you might black out\") of the Orthostatic Hypotension Symptom Assessment (OHSA) subsection of the OHQ at maintenance week 1. At week 1, mean (standard deviation) improvement on OHSA item 1 was 2.3 (2.95) for droxidopa versus 1.3 (3.16) for placebo (P\u2009=\u20090.018). In addition, mean increase in s-SBP at week 1 was 6.4 (18.85) for droxidopa versus 0.7 (20.18) mmHg for placebo (nominal P value: 0.032). Differences in change in OHSA item 1 scores from baseline to maintenance weeks 2, 4, and 8 were not statistically significant. Adverse-event (AE) incidence was similar across groups, but 12.4% of droxidopa and 6.1% of placebo subjects withdrew because of AEs. The most common AEs on droxidopa (vs. placebo) were headache (13.5% vs. 7.3%) and dizziness (10.1% vs. 4.9%). Study nOH306B demonstrated subjective (OHSA item 1) and objective (s-SBP) evidence of short-term droxidopa efficacy (vs. placebo) for symptomatic nOH in PD.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes have been implicated in the immune responses associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Inhibition of astrocyte apoptosis is a novel strategy for the treatment of PD. Recent studies suggest that \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (\u03b17-nAChRs) expressed in glial cells are critical links between inflammation and neurodegeneration in PD. However, little is known about their contribution to astrocyte apoptosis during the development of this disorder. In the present study, we showed that nicotine exerts a protective effect on H2O2-induced astrocyte apoptosis and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) downregulation, and this effect was abolished by an \u03b17-nAChR-selective antagonist. The underlying mechanisms might involve alleviation of mitochondrial membrane potential loss, stabilization of the Bax/Bcl-2 balance, and inhibition of cleaved caspase-9 activity through \u03b17-nAChR activation. Systemic administration of nicotine dramatically alleviated MPTP-induced symptoms, protected dopaminergic neurons against degeneration, inhibited astrocytes and microglia activation in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and blocked the decrease of GDNF in the striatum by activating \u03b17-nAChRs. Taken together these findings demonstrate, for the first time, that nicotine suppresses H2O2-induced astrocyte apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway through the stimulation of \u03b17-nAChRs. Targeting \u03b17-nAChRs expressed in astrocytes may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Concerns persist that deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) increases impulsivity or induces excessive reward seeking. We report here the performance of PD patients with implanted subthalamic nucleus electrodes, with stimulation on and off, on 3 laboratory tasks of risk taking and decision making. They are compared with PD patients maintained on medication and healthy participants.\nIn the Game of Dice Task, a test of \"risky\" decision making, PD patients with or without DBS made highest risk bets more often and ended up with less money than did healthy participants. There was a trend for DBS stimulation to ameliorate this effect. Deal or No-Deal is an \"ambiguous\" decision-making task that assessed preference for risk (holding on to one's briefcase) over a \"sure thing\" (accepting the banker's offer). Here, DBS patients were more conservative with stimulation on than with it off. They accepted smaller offers from the banker and won less money in the DBS-on condition. Overall, the 2 PD groups won less money than did healthy participants. The Framing Paradigm assessed willingness to gamble on a fixed (unambiguous) prize depending on whether the reward was \"framed\" as a loss or a gain. Nonsurgical PD patients tended to be more risk-averse than were healthy participants, whereas DBS patients were more willing to gamble for gains as well as losses both on and off stimulation.\nOn risky decision-making tasks, DBS patients took more risks than did healthy participants, but stimulation may temper this tendency. In contrast, in an ambiguous-risk situation, DBS patients were more risk-averse (conservative) than were healthy participants, and this tendency was greatest with stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences in Parkinson disease clinical features have been reported, but few studies have examined sex influences on use of dopaminergic medication in early Parkinson disease. The objective of this study was to test if there are differences in the type of dopaminergic medication used and levodopa equivalent daily dose between men and women with early Parkinson disease enrolled in a large multicenter study of Creatine as a potential disease modifying therapy - the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Exploratory Trials in Parkinson Disease Long-Term Study-1.\nBaseline data of 1,741 participants from 45 participating sites were analyzed. Participants from the United States and Canada were enrolled within five years of Parkinson Disease diagnosis. Two outcome variables were studied: type of dopaminergic medication used and levodopa equivalent daily dose at baseline in the Long-Term Study-1. Chi-square statistic and linear regression models were used for statistical analysis.\nThere were no statistically significant differences in the frequency of use of different types of dopaminergic medications at baseline between men and women with Parkinson Disease. A small but statistically significant difference was observed in the median unadjusted levodopa equivalent daily dose at baseline between women (300 mg) and men (325 mg), but this was not observed after controlling for disease duration (years since Parkinson disease diagnosis), disease severity (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Motor and Activities of Daily Living Scores), and body weight.\nIn this large multicenter study, we did not observe sex differences in the type and dose of dopaminergic medications used in early Parkinson Disease. Further research is needed to evaluate the influence of male or female sex on use of dopaminergic medication in mid- and late-stage Parkinson Disease.",

    "abstract": "There is considerable evidence showing that the neurodegenerative processes that lead to sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) begin many years before the appearance of the characteristic motor symptoms. Neuropsychiatric, sensorial and cognitive deficits are recognized as early non-motor manifestations of PD, and are not attenuated by the current anti-parkinsonian therapy. Although loss-of-function mutations in the parkin gene cause early-onset familial PD, Parkin-deficient mice do not display spontaneous degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway or enhanced vulnerability to dopaminergic neurotoxins such as 6-OHDA and MPTP. Here, we employed adult homozygous C57BL/6 mice with parkin gene deletion on exon 3 (parkin-/-) to further investigate the relevance of Parkin in the regulation of non-motor features, namely olfactory, emotional, cognitive and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Parkin-/- mice displayed normal performance on behavioral tests evaluating olfaction (olfactory discrimination), anxiety (elevated plus-maze), depressive-like behavior (forced swimming and tail suspension) and motor function (rotarod, grasping strength and pole). However, parkin-/- mice displayed a poor performance in the open field habituation, object location and modified Y-maze tasks suggestive of procedural and short-term spatial memory deficits. These behavioral impairments were accompanied by impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). These findings indicate that the genetic deletion of parkin causes deficiencies in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, resulting in memory deficits with no major olfactory, emotional or motor impairments. Therefore, parkin-/- mice may represent a promising animal model to study the early stages of PD and for testing new therapeutic strategies to restore learning and memory and synaptic plasticity impairments in PD.",

    "abstract": "Several types of D2R and D1R heteroreceptor complexes were discovered in the indirect and direct pathways of the striatum, respectively. The hypothesis is given that changes in the function of the dopamine heteroreceptor complexes may help us understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the motor complications of long-term therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) with l-DOPA and dopamine receptor agonists.\nIn the indirect pathway, the potential role of the A2AR-D2R, A2AR-D2R-mGluR5 and D2R-NMDAR heteroreceptor complexes in PD are covered and in the direct pathway, the D1R-D3R, A1R-D1R, D1R-NMDAR and putative A1R-D1R-D3R heteroreceptor complexes.\nOne explanation for the more powerful ability of l-DOPA treatment versus treatment with the partial dopamine receptor agonist/antagonist activity to induce dyskinesias, may be that dopamine formed from l-DOPA acts as a full agonist. The field of D1R and D2R heteroreceptor complexes in the CNS opens up a new understanding of the wearing off of the antiparkinson actions of l-DOPA and dopamine receptor agonists and the production of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. It can involve a reorganization of the D1R and D2R heteroreceptor complexes and a disbalance of the D1R and D2R homomers versus non-dopamine receptor homomers in the direct and indirect pathways.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for the management of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the coupled adjustment of pharmacologic therapy and stimulation parameter settings is a time-consuming process and treatment outcomes are not always optimal. In this study, we develop a linear function that relates the DBS parameters, the levodopa dosage, and patient-specific preoperative clinical data with the actual treatment motor outcomes. To this end, we incorporate image-based patient-specific computer models of the volume of tissue activated by DBS in a multilinear regression analysis (6 PD patients; 60 follow up visits). The resulting predictor function was highly correlated with the actual motor outcomes (r = 0.76; p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that the outcomes of a combined pharmacologic-DBS therapy can be predicted and may facilitate patient-specific treatment optimization for maximal benefits and minimal adverse effects.",

    "abstract": "A novel hybrid method named SCFW-KELM, which integrates effective subtractive clustering features weighting and a fast classifier kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM), has been introduced for the diagnosis of PD. In the proposed method, SCFW is used as a data preprocessing tool, which aims at decreasing the variance in features of the PD dataset, in order to further improve the diagnostic accuracy of the KELM classifier. The impact of the type of kernel functions on the performance of KELM has been investigated in detail. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method have been rigorously evaluated against the PD dataset in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), f-measure, and kappa statistics value. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed SCFW-KELM significantly outperforms SVM-based, KNN-based, and ELM-based approaches and other methods in the literature and achieved highest classification results reported so far via 10-fold cross validation scheme, with the classification accuracy of 99.49%, the sensitivity of 100%, the specificity of 99.39%, AUC of 99.69%, the f-measure value of 0.9964, and kappa value of 0.9867. Promisingly, the proposed method might serve as a new candidate of powerful methods for the diagnosis of PD with excellent performance.",

    "abstract": "When l-dopa use began in the early 1960s for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, nausea and reversible dyskinesias were experienced as continuing side effects. Carbidopa or benserazide was added to l-dopa in 1975 solely to control nausea. Subsequent to the increasing use of carbidopa has been the recognition of irreversible dyskinesias, which have automatically been attributed to l-dopa. The research into the etiology of these phenomena has identified the causative agent of the irreversible dyskinesias as carbidopa, not l-dopa. The mechanism of action of the carbidopa and benserazide causes irreversible binding and inactivation of vitamin B6 throughout the body. The consequences of this action are enormous, interfering with over 300 enzyme and protein functions. This has the ability to induce previously undocumented profound antihistamine dyskinesias, which have been wrongly attributed to l-dopa and may be perceived as irreversible if proper corrective action is not taken.",

    "abstract": "Numerous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies on gray matter (GM) in patients with the Parkinson variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P) and Parkinson's disease (PD) have been separately conducted. Identifying the different neuroanatomical changes in GM between MSA-P and PD through meta-analysis may aid the differential diagnosis of MSA-P and PD. A systematic review of VBM studies on patients with MSA-P and PD compared to healthy controls (HC) from the PubMed and Embase databases between January 1995 and June 2014 was conducted. Five studies comparing MSA-P with HC and twenty-three studies comparing PD with HC were included. The anatomical distribution of the coordinates of GM volume (GMV) differences was analyzed using the anatomical likelihood estimation (ALE) method. GMV reductions were present in the bilateral putamen, claustrum, insula, midbrain and left cerebellum in MSA-P. In PD, GMV decreases were present in the frontal, parietal, occipital and limbic lobes. Subtraction meta-analysis was performed to explore the differences in GM abnormalities between MSA-P and PD during the early stage of the disease. For patients with disease duration within 5 years, compared with PD, the decrease in GMV focused on the bilateral putamen and claustrum in MSA-P. In contrast, for patients with disease duration within 3 years, no significant GMV difference was found between MSA-P and PD. Our meta-analysis indicated that the atrophy of bilateral putamen or claustrum is not a neuroanatomical marker for distinguishing MSA-P from PD during the early stage by using the VBM method.",

    "abstract": "Chronic treatment with levodopa is associated with the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias particularly in young Parkinson patients. In some cases, dyskinesias become so severe that they interfere with normal movement and negatively impact quality of life.\nIn this review, we discuss benefits and limits of available therapeutic approaches aimed at delaying or managing dyskinesias as well as new strategies that are currently under investigation.\nAmong available treatments, monotherapy with dopamine agonists in the early phases of the disease reduces the risk for dyskinesias compared with levodopa. Nevertheless, dopamine agonists are unable to prevent dyskinesias once levodopa is added, which is always required once disease severity progresses. Convincing evidence of dyskinesia improvement has been shown only for deep brain stimulation and to some extent also for duodenal levodopa infusion and subcutaneous apomorphine. These approaches are expensive, have restrictive inclusion criteria and can cause potentially serious side effects. Alternative therapies include drugs targeting nondopaminergic neurotransmitter systems. Amantadine improves dyskinesias but its long-term effect is often unsatisfactory. Glutamatergic and gabaergic compounds have been tested in clinical trials, with promising results. By contrast, adrenergic drugs, fipamezole and idazoxan, did not show antidyskinetic effect.",

    "abstract": "LRRK2 mutations are a frequent cause of familial Parkinson disease (PD) and are also found in a number of sporadic PD cases. PD-linked G2019S and I2020T mutations in the kinase domain of LRRK2 result in elevated kinase activity, which is required for the toxicity of these pathogenic variants in cell and animal models of PD. We recently reported that LRRK2 interacts with and phosphorylates a number of mammalian ribosomal proteins, several of which exhibit increased phosphorylation via both G2019S and I2020T LRRK2. Blocking the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein s15 through expression of phospho-deficient T136A s15 prevents age-associated locomotor deficits and dopamine neuron loss caused by G2019S LRRK2 expression in Drosophila indicating that s15 is a pathogenic LRRK2 substrate. We previously described that G2019S LRRK2 causes an induction of bulk mRNA translation that is blocked by T136A s15 or the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. Here, we report the protective effects of the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction inhibitor 4EGI-1, in preventing neurodegenerative phenotypes in G2019S LRRK2 flies, and discuss how our findings and those of other groups provide a framework to begin investigating the mechanistic impact of LRRK2 on translation.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dynamics has recently become an area of piqued interest in neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson disease (PD); however, the contribution of astrocytes to these disorders remains unclear. Here, we show that the level of dynamin-like protein 1 (Dlp1; official name DNM1L), which promotes mitochondrial fission, is lower in astrocytes from the brains of PD patients, and that decreased astrocytic Dlp1 likely represents a relatively early event in PD pathogenesis. In support of this conclusion, we show that Dlp1 knockdown dramatically affects mitochondrial morphological characteristics and localization in astrocytes, impairs the ability of astrocytes to adequately protect neurons from the excitotoxic effects of glutamate, and increases intracellular Ca(2+) in response to extracellular glutamate, resulting from compromised intracellular Ca(2+) buffering. Taken together, our results suggest that astrocytic mitochondrial Dlp1 is a key protein in mitochondrial dynamics and decreased Dlp1 may interfere with neuron survival in PD by disrupting Ca(2+)-coupled glutamate uptake.",

    "abstract": "It is well-demonstrated that cannabinoid CB2 receptors located in glial cells are up-regulated in neurodegenerative disorders serving as a target to control glial influences to neurons. Recent evidence indicates that CB2 receptors may be also located in certain neuronal subpopulations and serve as a marker of neuronal losses. We investigated this possibility in the post-mortem substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and controls. Immunostaining for the CB2 receptor was found in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra, a fact confirmed with double-staining analyses. The signal was found in controls but also in PD patients, in which CB2 receptor labelling was significantly lower, in parallel to the losses of these neurons experienced in the disease. These data show for the first time that CB2 receptors are located in tyrosine hydroxylase-containing neurons in the substantia nigra at levels significantly lower in PD patients compared to controls.",

    "abstract": "If hallucinations are the most common of schizophrenic symptoms, they have been described in other pathologies such as Parkinson's disease (PD) but may differ considerably in their phenomenology. However, no multi-modal clinical scale with a transnosographic approach has been developed today. The purpose of this study was to create and validate a new tool for the hetero-assessment of all sensory modalities of hallucinations schizophrenia (SCZ) and in PD.\nScale items were generated by literature review and validated by medical board. A study was then made to evaluate psychometric properties of the Psycho-Sensory hAllucinations Scale (PSAS) that include four domains (auditory, visual, olfactory and gustatory, cenesthetic modalities) and one specific item 'guardian angel'.\nIt was then validated in 137 patients: 86 PD (53.5% male; mean age=53.3years) and 51 SCZ (64.7% male; mean age=38.5years). Factorial analysis of the PSAS found four factors. The PSAS showed good internal consistency [Kuder-Richardson alpha coefficient 0.49 to 0.77] and good test-retest reliability [Agreement %=0.75 to 0.97] and inter-rater reliability [Agreement %=0.78 to 1.0]. The convergent validity illustrates the concomitant evaluation of the concept between PSAS and PANSS P3 and UPDRS1 I2.\nThe PSAS can be useful to describe the whole hallucination and its evolution during the course of the disease and treatment in schizophrenia and PD. Moreover, it can allow us to undertake a clinic-pathological comparison of hallucination modalities between these two diseases, to enhance our understanding of their precise neurological mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Since brain stem regions associated with early Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology encroach upon those involved in taste function, the ability to taste may be compromised in PD. However, studies on this point have been contradictory. We administered well-validated whole-mouth and regional taste tests that incorporated multiple concentrations of sucrose, citric acid, caffeine, and sodium chloride to 29 early stage PD patients and 29 age-, sex-, and race-matched controls. Electrogustometry was also performed on the anterior tongue. The PD cohort was tested both on and off dopamine-related medications in counterbalanced test sessions. While whole-mouth taste identification test scores for all stimuli were, on average, nominally lower for the PD patients than for the controls, a trend in the opposite direction was noted for the intensity ratings at the lower stimulus concentrations for all stimuli except caffeine. Moreover, regional testing found that PD subjects tended to rate the stimuli, relative to the controls, as more intense on the anterior tongue and less intense on the posterior tongue. No significant associations were evident between taste test scores and UPDRS scores, L-DOPA medication equivalency values, or [(99m)Tc]TRODAT-1 SPECT imaging of dopamine transporter uptake within the striatum and associated regions. Our findings suggest that suprathreshold measures of taste function are influenced by PD and that this disease differentially influences taste function on anterior (CN VII) and posterior (CN IX) tongue regions. Conceivably PD-related damage to CN IX releases central inhibition on CN VII at the level of the brainstem, resulting in enhanced taste intensity on the anterior tongue.",

    "abstract": "Postural stability analysis has shown that postural control is impaired in untreated idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), even in the early stages of the disease. Vascular Parkinson's disease (VPD) lacks consensus clinical criteria or diagnostic tests. Moreover, the levodopa effect on postural balance remains undefined for IPD and even less so for VPD.\nTo characterize postural stability, using kinematic analysis with wearable inertial measurement units, in IPD and VPD patients without clinical PI, and to subsequently analyze the response to levodopa.\nTen patients with akinetic-rigid IPD and five patients with VPD were included. Clinical and postural stability kinematic analysis was performed before and after levodopa challenge, on different standing tasks: normal stance (NS), Romberg eyes open (REO) and Romberg eyes closed.\nIn the \"off state\", VPD patients had higher mean distances and higher maximal distance of p ostural sway on NS and REO tasks, respectively. VPD patients maintained a higher range of anterior-posterior (AP) postural sway after levodopa. In the absence of PI and non-significant differences in UPDRS-III, a higher mPIGD score in the VPD patients was mainly due to gait disturbance. Gait disturbance, and not UPDRS-III, influenced the degree of postural sway response to levodopa for VPD patients.\nQuantitative postural sway evaluation is useful in the investigation of Parkinsonian syndromes. VPD patients have higher AP postural sway that is correlated with their gait disturbance burden and also not responsive to levodopa. These observations corroborate the interconnection of postural control and locomotor networks.",

    "abstract": "Studies with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis have produced conflicting information about the involvement of the cerebellar hemispheres in Parkinson's disease (PD). We, thus, used a new approach for the analysis of DTI parameters in order to ascertain the involvement of the cerebellum in PD.\nWe performed a fiber tract-based analysis of cerebellar peduncles and cerebellar hemispheres in 16 healthy subjects and in 16 PD patients with more than 5 years duration of disease, using a 3T MRI scanner and a constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) approach for tractographic reconstructions. In addition, we performed statistical analysis of DTI parameters and fractional anisotropy (FA) XYZ direction samplings.\nWe found a statistically significant decrement of FA values in PD patients compared to controls (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, extrapolating and analyzing FA XYZ direction samplings for each patient and each control, we found that this result was due to a stronger decrement of FA values along the Y axis (antero-posterior direction) (p\u2009<\u20090.01); FA changes along X and Z axes were not statistically significant (p\u2009>\u20090.05). We confirmed also no statistically significant differences of FA and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for cerebellar peduncles in PD patients compared to healthy controls.\nThe DTI-based cerebellar abnormalities in PD could constitute an advance in the knowledge of this disease. We demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of FA in cerebellar hemispheres of PD patients compared to healthy controls. Our work also demonstrated that the use of more sophisticated approaches in the DTI parameter analysis could potentially have a clinical relevance.",

In addition, extrapolating and analyzing FA XYZ direction samplings for each patient and each control, we found that this result was due to a stronger decrement of FA values along the Y axis (antero-posterior direction) (p\u2009<\u20090.01); FA changes along X and Z axes were not statistically significant (p\u2009>\u20090.05).

    "abstract": "Despite widespread use of methamphetamine and other amphetamine-type stimulants (METH/AMPH), little is known about the long-term medical consequences of METH/AMPH abuse and dependence. Preclinical neurotoxicity findings raise public health concerns that these stimulants may damage dopamine neurons, resulting in dopamine-related disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD).\nA retrospective design was used to examine statewide medical records (1996 through 2011) linked to the Utah Population Database. Individuals 30 years or older on December 31, 2011 were assigned to a METH/AMPH cohort (ICD-9-CM 304.4, 305.7, 969.7, E854.2; N=4935), a cocaine cohort (ICD-9-CM 304.2, 305.6, 968.5, E855.2; N=1867) or a population cohort unexposed to drugs or alcohol for control selection. A competing-risks, proportional hazards model was used to determine whether the METH/AMPH or cocaine cohorts were at increased risk of developing PD (ICD-9-CM 332.0) or PD/parkinsonism/essential tremor (PD/PT; ICD-9-CM 332.0, 332.1, 333.0, 333.1) compared to individually sex- and age-matched controls (5:1 control to case ratio; N=34,010).\nIn METH/AMPH users, we observed an increased risk of PD and PD/PT (HRPD=2.8, 95%CI 1.6-4.8, P<10(-3); HRPD/PT=3.1, 95%CI 1.9-4.9, P<10(-4)) compared to population-based controls. Conversely, cocaine users exhibited no elevated risk of PD compared to controls.\nWe observed a near three-fold increased risk of PD in METH/AMPH users vs. controls which confirms prior observations and supports that PD risk in users may be higher than previous estimates. A suggestion that female and male users may differ in PD susceptibility warrants further study.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a difficult disease to diagnose although it is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies show that exosome isolated from urine contains LRRK2 or DJ-1, proteins whose mutations cause PD. To investigate a potential use for urine exosomes as a tool for PD diagnosis, we compared levels of LRRK2, \u03b1-synuclein, and DJ-1 in urine exosomes isolated from Korean PD patients and non-PD controls. LRRK2 and DJ-1, but not \u03b1-synuclein, were detected in the urine exosome samples, as reported previously. We initially could not detect any significant difference in these protein levels between the patient and the control groups. However, when age, disease duration, L-dopa daily dose, and gender were considered as analytical parameters, LRRK2 and DJ-1 protein levels showed clear gender-dependent differences. In addition, DJ-1 level was significantly higher (1.7-fold) in male patients with PD than that in male non-PD controls and increased in an age-dependent manner in male patients with PD. Our observation might provide a clue to lead to a novel biomarker for PD diagnosis, at least in males.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) can exhibit a reduction of spontaneous facial expression, designated as \"facial masking,\" a symptom in which facial muscles become rigid. To improve clinical assessment of facial expressivity of PD, this work attempts to quantify the dynamic facial expressivity (facial activity) of PD by automatically recognizing facial action units (AUs) and estimating their intensity. Spontaneous facial expressivity was assessed by comparing 7 PD patients with 8 control participants. To voluntarily produce spontaneous facial expressions that resemble those typically triggered by emotions, six emotions (amusement, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise, and fear) were elicited using movie clips. During the movie clips, physiological signals (facial electromyography (EMG) and electrocardiogram (ECG)) and frontal face video of the participants were recorded. The participants were asked to report on their emotional states throughout the experiment. We first examined the effectiveness of the emotion manipulation by evaluating the participant's self-reports. Disgust-induced emotions were significantly higher than the other emotions. Thus we focused on the analysis of the recorded data during watching disgust movie clips. The proposed facial expressivity assessment approach captured differences in facial expressivity between PD patients and controls. Also differences between PD patients with different progression of Parkinson's disease have been observed.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), internal cueing mechanisms are impaired leading to symptoms like hypokinesia. However, external cues can improve movement execution by using cortical resources. These cortical processes can be affected by cognitive decline in dementia. It is still unclear how dementia in PD influences external cueing. We investigated a group of 25 PD patients with dementia (PDD) and 25 non-demented PD patients (PDnD) matched by age, sex, and disease duration in a simple reaction time task using an additional acoustic cue. PDD patients benefited from the additional cue in similar magnitude as did PDnD patients. However, withdrawal of the cue led to a significantly increased reaction time in the PDD group compared to the PDnD patients. Our results indicate that even PDD patients can benefit from strategies using external cue presentation but the process of cognitive worsening can reduce the effect when cues are withdrawn.",

    "abstract": "Slowing of the electroencephalogram (EEG) is frequent in Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlates with cognitive decline. As overlap pathology plays a role in the pathogenesis of dementia, it is likely that demented patients in PD show similar physiological alterations as in AD.\nTo analyze distinctive quantitative EEG characteristics in early cognitive dysfunction in PD and AD.\nForty patients (20 PD- and 20 AD patients with early cognitive impairment) and 20 normal controls (NC) were matched for gender, age, and education. Resting state EEG was recorded from 256 electrodes. Relative power spectra, median frequency (4-14\u2009Hz), and neuropsychological outcome were compared between groups.\nRelative theta power in left temporal region and median frequency separated the three groups significantly (p\u2009=\u20090.002 and p\u2009<\u20090.001). Relative theta power was increased and median frequency reduced in patients with both diseases compared to NC. Median frequency was higher in AD than in PD and classified groups significantly (p\u2009=\u20090.02).\nIncrease of theta power in the left temporal region and a reduction of median frequency were associated with presence of AD or PD. PD patients are characterized by a pronounced slowing as compared to AD patients. Therefore, in both disorders EEG slowing might be a useful biomarker for beginning cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Upper extremity deficits are prevalent in individuals with Parkinson disease (PD). In the early stages of PD, such deficits can be subtle and challenging to document on clinical examination.\nThe purpose of this study was to use a novel force sensor system to characterize grip force modulation, including force, temporal, and movement quality parameters, during a fine motor control task in individuals with early stage PD.\nA case-control study was conducted.\nFourteen individuals with early stage PD were compared with a control group of 14 healthy older adults. The relationship of force modulation parameters with motor symptom severity and disease chronicity also was assessed in people with PD. Force was measured during both precision and power grasp tasks using an instrumented twist-cap device capable of rotating in either direction.\nCompared with the control group, the PD group demonstrated more movement arrests during both precision and power grasp and longer total movement times during the power grasp. These deficits persisted when a concurrent cognitive task was added, with some evidence of force control deficits in the PD group, including lower rates of force production during the precision grasp task and higher peak forces during the power grasp task. For precision grasp, a higher number of movement arrests in single- and dual-task conditions as well as longer total movement times in the dual-task condition were associated with more severe motor symptoms.\nThe sample was small and consisted of individuals in the early stages of PD with mild motor deficits. The group with PD was predominantly male, whereas the control group was predominantly female.\nThe results suggest that assessing grip force modulation deficits during fine motor tasks is possible with instrumented devices, and such sensitive measures may be important for detecting and tracking change early in the progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "In the course of Parkinson's disease (PD), the enteric nervous system (ENS) and parasympathetic nerves are amongst the structures earliest and most frequently affected by alpha-synuclein pathology. Accordingly, gastrointestinal dysfunction, in particular constipation, is an important non-motor symptom in PD and often precedes the onset of motor symptoms by years. Recent research has shown that intestinal microbiota interact with the autonomic and central nervous system via diverse pathways including the ENS and vagal nerve. The gut microbiome in PD has not been previously investigated. We compared the fecal microbiomes of 72 PD patients and 72 control subjects by pyrosequencing the V1-V3 regions of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Associations between clinical parameters and microbiota were analyzed using generalized linear models, taking into account potential confounders. On average, the abundance of Prevotellaceae in feces of PD patients was reduced by 77.6% as compared with controls. Relative abundance of Prevotellaceae of 6.5% or less had 86.1% sensitivity and 38.9% specificity for PD. A logistic regression classifier based on the abundance of four bacterial families and the severity of constipation identified PD patients with 66.7% sensitivity and 90.3% specificity. The relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae was positively associated with the severity of postural instability and gait difficulty. These findings suggest that the intestinal microbiome is altered in PD and is related to motor phenotype. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the temporal and causal relationships between gut microbiota and PD and the suitability of the microbiome as a biomarker.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may experience impulse control disorders (ICDs) when on dopamine agonist therapy for their motor symptoms. In the last few years, a rapid growth of interest for the recognition of these aberrant behaviors and their neurobiological correlates has occurred. Recent advances in neuroimaging are helping to identify the neuroanatomical networks responsible for these ICDs, and together with psychopharmacological assessments are providing new insights into the brain status of impulsive behavior. The genetic associations that may be unique to ICDs in PD are also being identified. Complementing human studies, electrophysiological and biochemical studies in animal models are providing insights into neuropathological mechanisms associated with these disorders. New animal models of ICDs in PD patients are being implemented that should provide critical means to identify efficacious therapies for PD-related motor deficits while avoiding ICD side effects. Here, we provide an overview of these recent advances, with a particular emphasis on the neurobiological correlates reported in animal models and patients along with their genetic underpinnings.",

    "abstract": "The commonest known cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the G2019S mutation of the LRRK2 gene, but this mutation is not sufficient for causing PD, and many carriers of the mutation never develop PD symptoms during life. Differences at the expression level of certain genes, resulting from either genetic variations or environmental interactions, might be one of the mechanisms underlying differential risks for developing both idiopathic and genetic PD. To identify the genes involved in PD pathogenesis, we compared genome-wide gene expression (RNA-seq) in peripheral blood of 20 PD patients carrying the G2019S mutation of the LRRK2 gene, 20 asymptomatic carriers of the mutation, 20 subjects with idiopathic PD, 20 controls and 7 PD patients before and after initiating dopaminergic therapy. We identified 13 common genes (ADARB2, CEACAM6, CNTNAP2, COL19A1, DEF4, DRAXIN, FCER2, HBG1, NCAPG2, PVRL2, SLC2A14, SNCA, and TCL1B) showing significant differential expression between G2019S-associated PD and asymptomatic carriers and also between idiopathic PD and controls but not between untreated and treated patients. Some of these genes are functionally involved in the processes known to be involved in PD pathogenesis, such as Akt signaling, glucose metabolism, or immunity. We consider that these genes merit further attention in future studies as potential candidate genes involved in both idiopathic and LRRK2-G2019S-associated forms of PD.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is approved for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) but has a poor evidence base in Parkinson-plus syndromes such as multiple system atrophy (MSA). We describe the clinical and neuropathological findings in a man who was initially diagnosed with IPD, in whom DBS was unsuccessful, and in whom MSA was unexpectedly diagnosed at a subsequent autopsy. This case report highlights that DBS is often unsuccessful in MSA and also demonstrates that MSA can masquerade as IPD, which may explain treatment failure in a small group of patients apparently suffering from Parkinson's disease. Additionally, it also presents a case with an unusually long duration of disease prior to death, comparable only to a handful of other cases in the literature.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) gene has been implicated in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Several studies have evaluated the association between the UCH-L1 S18Y variant and the risk of PD. However, conflicting results have been reported. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to explore whether the UCH-L1 S18Y variant is associated with susceptibility to PD in Asians. A database search in Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase and PubMed up to March 2014 identified 10 studies comprising 4,897 PD patients and 4,446 controls in total, which were included in this meta-analysis. In an updated meta-analysis, no significant associations between the S18Y polymorphism and PD in Asians were observed in recessive [p = 0.28, odds ratio (OR) = 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86-1.04] or dominant models (p = 0.46, OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.88-1.06). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, still no significant association was detected in dominant (for Chinese, OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.85-1.10; for Japanese, OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.83-1.11) and recessive models (for Chinese, OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.88-1.11; for Japanese, OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.76-1.04). The results of this meta-analysis suggested that the UCHL-1 S18Y polymorphism was not associated with the risk of PD in Asians. To our knowledge, this is the latest and largest meta-analysis assessing the association of the UCHL-1 S18Y variant with the risk of PD in Asian ancestry. \u00a9 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), which can partly be modulated by innate and adaptive immune functions, and vice versa. Here, naturally occurring \u03b1-Syn autoantibodies (\u03b1-Syn-nAbs) may be effective against \u03b1-Syn pathoetiology and may serve as a PD biomarker. However, serum and cerebrospinal fluid \u03b1-Syn-nAbs levels still lack consistent evidence as required for a reliable PD biomarker. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid \u03b1-Syn-nAbs levels of 66 PD patients and 69 healthy controls were assessed using a validated ELISA assay. Moreover, potential sources of error variance including unspecific ELISA background signals, free serum hemoglobin concentrations, \u03b1-Syn plate coating procedures, and differences in \u03b1-Syn-nAbs standards, were investigated. PD patients and controls did not differ in serum (p\u200a=\u200a.49) nor cerebrospinal fluid (p\u200a=\u200a.29) \u03b1-Syn-nAbs levels. Interestingly, free serum hemoglobin concentrations were negatively correlated with \u03b1-Syn-nAbs levels in controls (Spearman \u03c1\u200a=\u200a-.41, p<.001), but not in PD patients (\u03c1\u200a=\u200a.16, p\u200a=\u200a.21). ELISA \u03b1-Syn plate coating procedures impacted inter-assay variability (same day coating: 8-16%; coating on different days: 16-58%). \u03b1-Syn-nAbs standards from different purification batches differed regarding optical density measured in ELISAs suggesting differences in \u03b1-Syn affinity. While \u03b1-Syn-nAbs levels may represent a potential PD biomarker, several methodological issues have to be considered to increase reproducibility of \u03b1-Syn-nAbs findings. Further studies using standardized protocols minimizing sources of error variance may be necessary to establish a reliable PD \u03b1-Syn-nAbs biomarker.",

    "abstract": "Speaking louder/more intensely represents a longstanding technique employed to manage voice and intelligibility changes in people with Parkinson's. This technique has been formalized into a treatment approach and marketed as the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT\u00ae) programme. Evidence for its efficacy has been published. Studies to date are dominated by research facility reports from the original LSVT\u00ae group or closely associated groups. Evidence for the efficacy of LSVT\u00ae in routine clinical settings is lacking.\nWe conducted an audit of outcomes for consecutive people with Parkinson's who were offered and completed LSVT\u00ae in a routine hospital outpatient setting. In- and exclusion criteria, assessment and treatment protocols followed precisely the methods stipulated by LSVT\u00ae Global. Additionally, participants completed the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and 23 carers completed a visual analogue scale (VAS) for items relating to functional outcomes.\nGroup data (n = 33) revealed statistically significant increases in all objective and subjective measures at the end of treatment, though outcomes on the different measures revealed variable individual responses. Mean intensity increases on prolonged vowel were 9.3 dB post-treatment. Significant gains of mean 7.5 and 6.8 dB were maintained at 12 (n = 25) and 24 months (n = 15) respectively for those available for follow-up. Significant intensity gains occurred for reading post-therapy (mean = 8.5 dB), but changes reverted to statistically non-significant at 12 and 24 months. Intensity increase (mean = 8.5 dB) was significant for monologues post-therapy, but not at 12 and 24 months. Median VHI improvement was statistically significant post-therapy and at 12 months, but not at 24 months. Carer VAS ratings all improved significantly post-therapy; at 12 months only perceived loudness, strain, mumbling and intelligibility remained statistically significantly above baseline. No significant gains persisted to 24 months.\nLSVT\u00ae was successful for most individuals in this study. Not all patients attained significant changes by the end of treatment. Few patients who achieved significant gain at the end of treatment maintained this at 12 or 24 months. Implications for maintenance, interpretation of results in a degenerative condition and implications for further research are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The lack of cure to age associated Parkinson's disease (PD) has been challenging the efforts of researchers as well as health care providers. Recent evidences suggest that diabetic patients tend to show a higher future risk for PD advocating a strong correlation between PD and Diabetes, thus making it intriguing to decipher common genetic cues behind these ailments. We carried out studies on ida-1, the C. elegans orthologue of mammalian type-1 diabetes auto-antigen IA-2 towards achieving its functional workup vis-\u00e0-vis various associated endpoints of PD and Diabetes. Employing transgenic C. elegans strain expressing \"human\" alpha synuclein (NL5901) under normal and increased glucose concentrations, we studied aggregation of alpha synuclein, content of dopamine, expression of dopamine transporter, content of reactive oxygen species, locomotor activity, nuclear translocation of FOXO transcription factor Daf-16, and quantification of Daf2/Daf-16 mRNA. Our findings indicate that ida-1 affords protection in the studied disease conditions as absence of ida-1 resulted in higher alpha-synuclein aggregation under conditions that mimic the blood glucose levels of diabetic patients. We also observed reduced dopamine content, decreased motility, defective Daf-16 translocation and reduced expression of Daf-2 and Daf-16. Our studies establish important function of ida-1 as a modulator in Daf-2/Daf-16 insulin like signalling pathway thus possibly being a common link between PD and Diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) region of the midbrain. Oxidative damage in this region has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Human neurons have been discovered to contain hemoglobin, with an increased concentration seen in the neurons of the SN. High affinity hemoglobin is a clinical entity resulting from mutations that create a functional increase in the binding of hemoglobin to oxygen and an inability to efficiently unload it to tissues. This can result in a number of metabolic compensatory changes, including an elevation in circulating hemoglobin and an increase in the molecule 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG). Population based studies have revealed that patients with PD have elevated hemoglobin as well as 2,3-DPG levels. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the oxidative damage seen in PD is related to an underlying high affinity hemoglobin subtype.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 1.5 million Americans are affected by Parkinson's disease (Deponti et al., 2013) which includes the symptoms of postural instability and gait dysfunction. Currently, clinical evaluations of postural instability and gait dysfunction consist of a subjective rater assessment of gait patterns using items from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and assessments can be insensitive to the effectiveness of medical interventions. Current research suggests the importance of cycling for Parkinson's disease patients, and while Parkinson's gait has been evaluated in previous studies, little is known about lower extremity control during cycling. The purpose of this study is to examine the lower extremity coordination patterns of Parkinson's patients during cycling.\nTwenty five participants, ages 44-72, with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease participated in an exercise test on a cycle ergometer that was equipped with pedal force measurements. Crank torque, crank angle and power produced by right and left leg were measured throughout the test to calculate Symmetry Index at three stages of exercise (20 W, 60 W, maximum performance).\nDecreases in Symmetry Index were observed for average power output in Parkinson's patients as workload increased. Maximum power Symmetry Index showed a significant difference in symmetry between performance at both the 20 W and 60 W stage and the maximal resistance stage. Minimum power Symmetry Index did not show significant differences across the stages of the test. While lower extremity asymmetries were present in Parkinson's patients during pedaling, these asymmetries did not correlate to postural instability and gait dysfunction Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores.\nThis pedaling analysis allows for a more sensitive measure of lower extremity function than the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and may help to provide unique insight into current and future lower extremity function.",

    "abstract": "Measures from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging reflect changes in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease. It is the case, however, that partial volume effects from free water can bias diffusion measurements. The bi-tensor diffusion model was introduced to quantify the contribution of free water and eliminates its bias on estimations of tissue microstructure. Here, we test the hypothesis that free water is elevated in the substantia nigra for Parkinson's disease compared with control subjects. This hypothesis was tested between large cohorts of Parkinson's disease and control participants in a single-site study and validated against a multisite study using multiple scanners. The fractional volume of free water was increased in the posterior region of the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease compared with control subjects in both the single-site and multi-site studies. We did not observe changes in either cohort for free-water-corrected fractional anisotropy or free-water-corrected mean diffusivity. Our findings provide new evidence that the free-water index reflects alteration of the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease, and this was evidenced across both single-site and multi-site cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Aside from being measured in the context of producing facial expressions of emotion, the ability to voluntarily control a range of facial muscles in Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been systematically measured. We used in three enrollment phases an adaptation of the Upper and Lower Face Apraxia test, a measure of the ability to make voluntary movements of the upper and lower face in PD patients and healthy controls. Errors were scored due to (1) pauses prior to movement initiation, (2) loss of individuation, (3) impoverished movement, (4) no movement at all, or (5) content errors (likened to ideational apraxia errors). The results show impaired voluntary control of facial musculature in most but not all with PD (with large effect sizes) which correlated positively and highly with disease severity. Errors by PD patients were predominantly due to impoverished movement and individuation loss whereas those made by controls were predominantly due to individuation loss. Patients committed more errors than controls due to impoverishment and no movement, with negligible differences between groups in other errors. In summary, similarly to spontaneous and voluntary emotional expressions, voluntary non-emotional facial movements are impoverished in PD; impoverishment of all movement types will likely contribute to the mask-like facial appearance that is seen with disease progression. These findings also illustrate the utility of an adapted Face Apraxia test as a practical and sensitive measure of voluntary facial musculature control in PD. The test can be used to supplement clinical observations and as a research tool.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there is an association between cataracts and Parkinson's disease in Taiwan.\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted to analyze the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program from 1999 to 2002. This study consisted of 26,031 individuals aged 40-84 years with newly diagnosed cataracts as the cataract group and 25,937 randomly selected individuals without cataracts as the non-cataract group. Both groups were matched for sex, age and index year of diagnosing cataracts. The incidence of Parkinson's disease by the end of 2011 and the association of Parkinson's disease with cataracts and other comorbidities were measured.\nThe overall incidence of Parkinson's disease was 1.48-fold higher in the cataract group than the non-cataract group (3.18 vs. 2.15 per 1000 person-years, crude HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.32, 1.66). After adjusting for confounding factors, the adjusted HR of Parkinson's disease was 1.26 (95% CI 1.12, 1.42) for the cataract group, when compared with the non-cataract group. Dementia (HR 2.72, 95% CI 1.92, 3.84), depression (HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.63, 2.66), hypertension (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.26, 1.61), cerebrovascular disease (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.07, 1.63) and age (every one year, HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.07, 1.09) were other factors significantly related to Parkinson's disease.\nOverall, this study discloses a 26% increased hazard of Parkinson's disease in cataract patients. Further studies are required to investigate whether cataracts are one of non-motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Hallucinations and delusions that complicate Parkinson's disease (PD) could lead to nursing home placement and are linked to increased mortality. Cognitive impairments are typically associated with the presence of hallucinations but there are no data regarding whether such a relationship exists with delusions.\nWe hypothesized that hallucinations would be associated with executive and visuospatial disturbance. An exploratory examination of cognitive correlates of delusions was also completed to address the question of whether they differ from hallucinations.\n144 PD subjects completed a neuropsychological battery to assess cognition and the SAPS to examine psychosis. Correlational analyses assessed associations between hallucinations and delusions with cognitive domains.\n48 subjects (33%) reported psychotic symptoms: 25 (17%) experienced hallucinations without delusions, 23 (16%) had symptoms dominated by delusions. Severity and/or number of hallucination subtypes were significantly correlated with lower scores in language, memory, attention, executive functioning, and visuospatial ability. Correlations with delusions were non-significant. Tests of differences in the size of the correlations between groups revealed a significant relationship between language and visuospatial performance with hallucinations.\nCognitive correlates of hallucinations and delusions appear to be different in PD, suggesting distinct pathogenic mechanisms and possibly anatomical substrates. Hence, delusions may not share the same associations with dementia as hallucinations. Since this is a new finding, further studies will be needed to confirm our results.",

    "abstract": "The heterogeneity of non-motor symptoms (NMSs) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) has been well established. We investigated the effects of NMS as a cluster on the quality of life (QoL) of patients with PD. We recruited 180 patients with PD and used a descriptive cross-sectional study design. To determine interrelationships between non-motor symptoms, a principal component analysis with varimax rotation was performed based on the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). Among 180 PD patients, 172 patients (96.6%) had experienced at least 2 domains of concurrent non-motor symptoms. There were two types of non-motor symptom clusters (NMSCs). The first non-motor symptom cluster (NMSC1) consisted of mood, sleep/fatigue, attention/memory, urinary symptoms, and miscellaneous symptoms, while the second non-motor symptom cluster (NMSC2) consisted of perceptual problems, gastrointestinal issues, and cardiovascular symptoms. The elderly PD patients were more often categorized as experiencing NMSC2 than NMSC1. Our subgroup cluster analysis showed that PD patients with higher scoring NMS had significantly poorer QoL in both NMSC1 and NMSC2 subgroups, with subgroup-specific patterns. NMSCs also emerged differently depending on sex and the severity of PD. In conclusion, PD patients with NMS may have a specific cluster pattern of NMSC. Some NMSCs may have a negative impact on QoL. Understanding the clinical implications of NMSC in PD patients may provide better therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis and pathophysiology of a disease determine how it should be diagnosed and treated. Yet, understanding the cause and mechanisms of progression often requires intensive human efforts, especially for diseases with complex etiology. The latest genomic technology coupled with advanced, large-scale data analysis in the field known as bioinformatics has promised a high-throughput approach that can quickly identify disease-affected genes and pathways by examining tissue samples collected from patients and control subjects. Furthermore, significant biological themes indicative of genomic events can be recognized on the basis of affected genes. However, given identified biological themes, it is not clear how to organize genomic events to arrive at a coherent pathophysiological explanation about the disease. To address this important issue, we have developed an innovative method named \"Expression Data Up-Stream Analysis\" (EDUSA) that can perform a bioinformatics analysis to identify and rank upstream processes effectively. We applied it to Parkinson's disease (PD) using a genomic data set available at a public data repository known as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). In this study, disease-affected genes were identified using GEO2R software, and disease-pertinent processes were identified using EASE software. Then the EDUSA program was used to determine the upstream versus downstream hierarchy of the processes. The results confirmed the current misfolded protein theory about the pathogenesis of PD, and provided new insights as well. Particularly, our program discovered that RNA (ribonucleic acid) metabolism pathology was a potential cause of PD, which in fact, is an emerging theory of neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, it was found that the dysfunction of the transport system seemed to occur in the early phase of neurodegeneration, whereas mitochondrial dysfunction appeared at a later stage. Using this methodology, we have demonstrated how to determine the stages of disease development with single-point data collection.",

    "abstract": "Severity of PD is usually assessed by means of the motor and disability-based Hoehn and Yahr staging (HY), or clinician and patient global perceptions. Scores of more detailed assessments, as the MDS-UPDRS, have not been translated to a grading that allows assignment of score sections to severity levels. The objective of the present study is to determine cut-off points for PD severity levels based on the MDS-UPDRS.\nInternational, observational study. Applied assessments were: HY, MDS-UPDRS, Clinical Impression for Severity Index, and Clinical and Patient Global Impression of Severity. The coincidence in severity level (mild, moderate, severe) of at least two clinical classifications plus the patient's gradation was considered \"the criterion of severity\". Cut-off values for each MDS-UPDRS subscale was determined by triangulation of: 1) percentile 90 of the subscale total score; 2) receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis; and 3) ordinal logistic regression (OLR) model.\nSample was composed of 452 consecutive PD patients without dementia, 55.3% males, age 65.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.7 years and PD duration 8.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.3 years. All HY stages were represented. The \"criterion\", classified 275 patients (60.8% of the sample) as: mild PD, 149 (54.2%); moderate, 82 (29.8%); and severe, 44 (16%). The following MDS-UPDRS cut-off points between mild/moderate and moderate/severe levels were found: Part 1: 10/11 and 21/22; Part 2: 12/13 and 29/30; Part 3: 32/33 and 58/59; and Part 4: 4/5 and 12/13.\nCut-off points to classify PD patients as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of their MDS-UPDRS scores are proposed.",

    "abstract": "The Faroe Islands is a geographically isolated population in the North Atlantic with a high prevalence of Parkinson disease (PD). The disease etiology is still unknown, although dietary pollutants are considered a risk factor. The genetic risk underlying disease susceptibility has yet to be elucidated.\nSequence analysis was performed in genes previously linked with PD in 91 patients and 96 healthy control subjects.\nFourteen missense mutations, of which one was novel, were identified in six genes. One patient (1%) did carry the known pathogenic mutation LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation, 19 patients (22%) did carry mutations of unknown significance while 70 patients (78.0%) did not have any identifiable genetic risk. A total of 14 controls (14.6%) carried mutations of unknown significance.\nThis study suggests that rare variants in genes previously linked to PD are not major contributors to PD in the Faroe Islands. Further exome sequencing and comparative analyses within and among well-described pedigrees with multi-incident PD are now warranted.",

    "abstract": "To determine the prevalence and predictors of sexual dysfunction (SD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.\nAssessments of SD in the professional literature is limited. Understanding the predictors of SD can help physicians focus on this problem in vulnerable patients.\nA total of 60 PD patients and 60 controls answered the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale-Thai Version (ASEX-Thai) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) questionnaires, and were asked on 3 additional sets of questions about premature ejaculation (PE), dyspareunia, and hypersexual disorders.\nThe prevalence of SD in PD patients and controls was 81.6% and 48.3% respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). PD patients had lower BMI, lower uric acid level, higher HAMD score and had sexual intercourse (SI) less frequently. SD correlated with greater disease severity and depression. The most distressing problem in male patients was PE (51.4%) and orgasmic dissatisfaction (76%) for female patients. Logistic regression analysis found 3 factors were related to SD: no SI in the past month (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), postural instability (PI) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.028), and HAMD item 14 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.021), predicting SD with the OR of 12.2, 5.5, and 5.0 respectively.\nSD in PD is common and usually occurs with depression. Absence of SI in the past month, PI, and loss of libido are predictors of SD in PD. A simple and quick screening of SD can be routinely performed by inquiring patients about the frequency of SI and the examination of the pull test. Detailed assessment of sexual functioning and depression may guide physicians in proper management.",

    "abstract": "We compared fall frequency and prediction among People with Parkinson's Disease (PwP) with and without cognitive impairment (CI); researchers sometimes overlook the former, concerned about consent, recall and adherence and differences in fall frequency and predictability.\nWe recruited 101 PwP from one clinic, used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment to measure CI, noted repeated falls recalled retrospectively over 12 months and evaluated 'repeated falls' and 'difficulty turning' as predictors of falls over three months.\nParticipant median age was 76 years, and time since diagnosis 6 years. Of 40 participants without CI, 40% recalled falls and 55% fell during follow-up (1.9 (\u00b13.8) falls/person), the sensitivity of fall history being 57% and of turning 36%. Of 36 participants with mild CI, 42% recalled falls and 42% fell during follow-up (1.2 (\u00b11.8) falls/person), the sensitivity of fall history being 67% and of turning 69%. Of 25 participants with moderate CI, 60% recalled falls and 58% fell during follow-up (1.2 (\u00b11.8) falls/person), the sensitivity of fall history being 71% and of turning 69%.\nResearchers need not exclude people with CI assuming falls are more frequent and less predictable than among those without. Fall rates (falls/person during follow-up) were similar among people with and without CI. Falls and difficulty turning were more sensitive predictors of falling in those with CI than those without: a simple mobility test may suggest an individual's risk of falling if a history is unavailable. Most PwP with moderate CI fall repeatedly: carer involvement facilitates their inclusion in research.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a surprisingly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder. It is well established that different subtypes of PD present with different clinical courses and prognoses. However, the neural mechanism underlying these disparate presentations is uncertain.\nHere we used resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and the regional homogeneity (ReHo) method to determine neural activity patterns in the two main clinical subgroups of PD (akinetic-rigid and tremor-dominant).\nCompared with healthy controls, akinetic-rigid (AR) subjects had increased ReHo mainly in right amygdala, left putamen, bilateral angular gyrus, bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and decreased ReHo in left post cingulate gyrus/precuneus (PCC/PCu) and bilateral thalamus. In contrast, tremor-dominant (TD) patients showed higher ReHo mostly in bilateral angular gyrus, left PCC, cerebellum_crus1, and cerebellum_6, while ReHo was decreased in right putamen, primary sensory cortex (S1), vermis_3, and cerebellum_4_5. These results indicate that AR and TD subgroups both represent altered spontaneous neural activity in default-mode regions and striatum, and AR subjects exhibit more changed neural activity in the mesolimbic cortex (amygdala) but TD in the cerebellar regions. Of note, direct comparison of the two subgroups revealed a distinct ReHo pattern primarily located in the striatal-thalamo-cortical (STC) and cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) loops.\nOverall, our findings highlight the involvement of default mode network (DMN) and STC circuit both in AR and TD subtypes, but also underscore the importance of integrating mesolimbic-striatal and CTC loops in understanding neural systems of akinesia and rigidity, as well as resting tremor in PD. This study provides improved understanding of the pathophysiological models of different subtypes of PD.",

    "abstract": "Using the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Task Force Level 1 criteria, this study examined the classification of mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's Disease (PD-MCI) derived from a range of cut-off scores that have previously been suggested by the MDS Task Force. Furthermore, differences in PD-MCI frequencies were examined when comparing performance on current neuropsychological testing to the normative sample, as opposed to decline from premorbid functioning, as evidence of cognitive impairment.\nTwo hundred and thirty-four non-demented PD patients underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessment at the Parkinson's Disease Research Clinic at the Brain and Mind Research Institute, University of Sydney.\nWhen cognitive impairment was defined as 1SD and 1.5SD below premorbid intellect, 109 patients (47%) and 76 (32%) patients met criteria for PD-MCI respectively. This proportion dropped considerably to 50 patients (21%) with a 2SD cut-off score. However, when calculating impairment based on comparisons with normative data, only 68 patients (29%) and 41 patients (18%) met PD-MCI criteria when a cut-off score of 1 and 1.5SD was employed. This proportion dropped to just 22 patients (9%) with a 2SD cut-off score.\nResults from the present study suggest that the MDS PD-MCI criteria may be too broad, as substantial differences in frequencies of PD-MCI were observed with the application of differing criteria. We propose that a 1.5SD cut-off score below premorbid functioning may provide greater utility in characterizing PD-MCI than a 1.5SD cut-off below normative data, which has been widely applied in previous studies examining the MDS PD-MCI criteria.",

We propose that a 1.5SD cut-off score below premorbid functioning may provide greater utility in characterizing PD-MCI than a 1.5SD cut-off below normative data, which has been widely applied in previous studies examining the MDS PD-MCI criteria.",

It is necessary to continue the search for new miRNAs that may affect the development of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.\n20 untreated patients with Parkinson's disease and 18 treated patients with Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr scores 1-2) were studied. An analysis of the levels of 11 miRNAs in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients was carried out using reverse transcription followed by real-time PCR.\nThe levels of miR-7, miR-9-3p, miR-9-5p, miR-129, and miR-132 were increased by more than three times in treated patients with Parkinson's disease compared with those of the controls.\nIt is probable that miRNAs are very sensitive to drug therapy and that the effects of therapy observed may be associated with changes in the levels of these miRNAs and their target genes in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

Because erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in many previous studies, present study was designed to evaluate the effect of EPO on rotenone-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss. The rats in which PD was induced by stereotaxical infusion of rotenone showed increased MDA and TNF-alpha levels and decreased HVA levels. On the other hand, EPO treatment resulted in markedly decreased MDA and TNF-alpha levels and increased HVA levels. EPO treatment in rotenone-infusion group resulted in improvement of striatal neurodegeneration and a significant increase in decreased total number of neurons and immunohistochemical TH positive neurons. Results of the present study demonstrate the neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of EPO in a rotenone-induced neurodegenerative animal model.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) are neurodegenerative diseases that can be difficult to distinguish clinically. The objective of the current study was to use surface-based analysis techniques to assess cortical thickness, surface area and grey matter volume to identify unique morphological patterns of cortical atrophy in PD, MSA and PSP and to relate these patterns of change to disease duration and clinical features.\nHigh resolution 3D T1-weighted MRI volumes were acquired from 14 PD patients, 18 MSA, 14 PSP and 19 healthy control participants. Cortical thickness, surface area and volume analyses were carried out using the automated surface-based analysis package FreeSurfer (version 5.1.0). Measures of disease severity and duration were assessed for correlation with cortical morphometric changes in each clinical group.\nResults show that in PSP, widespread cortical thinning and volume loss occurs within the frontal lobe, particularly the superior frontal gyrus. In addition, PSP patients also displayed increased surface area in the pericalcarine. In comparison, PD and MSA did not display significant changes in cortical morphology.\nThese results demonstrate that patients with clinically established PSP exhibit distinct patterns of cortical atrophy, particularly affecting the frontal lobe. These results could be used in the future to develop a useful clinical application of MRI to distinguish PSP patients from PD and MSA patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology. Autopsy findings, genetics, retrospective studies, and molecular imaging all suggest a role for inflammation in the neurodegenerative process. However, relatively little is understood about the causes and implications of neuroinflammation in PD. Understanding how inflammation arises in PD, in particular the activation state of cells of the innate immune system, may provide an exciting opportunity for novel neuroprotective therapeutics. We analyze the evidence of immune system involvement in PD susceptibility, specifically in the context of M1 and M2 activation states. Tracking and modulating these activation states may provide new insights into both PD etiology and therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the second leading neurodegenerative disease in the US. As there is no known cause or cure for PD, researchers continue to investigate disease mechanisms and potential new therapies in cell culture and in animal models of PD. In PD, one of the most profoundly affected neuronal populations is the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). These DA-producing neurons undergo degeneration while neighboring DA-producing cells of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are largely spared. To aid in these studies, The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) partnered with Thomas Jefferson University and Taconic Inc. to generate new transgenic rat lines carrying the human TH gene promoter driving EGFP using a 11 kb construct used previously to create a hTH-GFP mouse reporter line. Of the five rat founder lines that were generated, three exhibited high level specific GFP fluorescence in DA brain structures (ie. SN, VTA, striatum, olfactory bulb, hypothalamus). As with the hTH-GFP mouse, none of the rat lines exhibit reporter expression in adrenergic structures like the adrenal gland. Line 12141, with its high levels of GFP in adult DA brain structures and minimal ectopic GFP expression in non-DA structures, was characterized in detail. We show here that this line allows for anatomical visualization and microdissection of the rat midbrain into SNpc and/or VTA, enabling detailed analysis of midbrain DA neurons and axonal projections after toxin treatment in vivo. Moreover, we further show that embryonic SNpc and/or VTA neurons, enriched by microdissection or FACS, can be used in culture or transplant studies of PD. Thus, the hTH-GFP reporter rat should be a valuable tool for Parkinson's disease research.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between dopamine and glutamate in the basal ganglia regulate critical aspects of motor and cognitive behavior. Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors are key modulators of glutamatergic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD). Preclinical evidence demonstrate that group I mGlu receptor antagonism and groups II and III mGlu receptor activation improve motor symptomatology of PD and decrease l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia by regulating excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the basal ganglia. Emotional and cognitive deficits are also observed in PD. Treatment of these symptoms is challenging and underscore the need for novel effective and well tolerated pharmacological treatments. This article will thus review the currently available knowledge regarding the therapeutic potential of targeting mGlu receptors to restore motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and dramatic motor and cognitive impairments. The current knowledge indicates that the strength of glutamatergic signals from the cortex to the striatum is regulated during the progression of the disease. The efficacy of ionotropic glutamate receptors to modulate synaptic transmission in the striatum indicates that modulation of the activity of these receptors may represent a key target to rescue the altered neurotransmission in PD. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that agents targeting ionotropic glutamate receptors may ameliorate the motor symptoms of PD as well as to reduce the onset of levodopa-induced dyskinetic motor behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease is a neurodegenerative disorder of aging, characterized by disabling motor symptoms resulting from the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and the decrease of dopamine in the striatum. Current therapies are directed at treating the symptoms but there is presently no cure for the disease. In order to discover neuroprotective compounds with a therapeutical potential, our research team has established original and highly regioselective methods for the synthesis of 2,3-disubstituted 6-aminoquinoxalines. To evaluate the neuroprotective activity of these molecules, we used midbrain cultures and various experimental conditions that promote dopaminergic cell loss. Among a series of 11 molecules, only compound MPAQ (2-methyl-3-phenyl-6-aminoquinoxaline) afforded substantial protection in a paradigm where dopaminergic neurons die spontaneously and progressively as they mature. Prediction of blood-brain barrier permeation by Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship studies (QSARs) suggested that MPAQ was able to reach the brain parenchyma with sufficient efficacy. HPLC-MS/MS quantification in brain homogenates and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry imaging on brain tissue sections performed in MPAQ-treated mice allowed us to confirm this prediction and to demonstrate, by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry imaging, that MPAQ was localized in areas containing vulnerable neurons and/or their terminals. Of interest, MPAQ also rescued dopaminergic neurons, which (i) acquired dependency on the trophic peptide GDNF for their survival or (ii) underwent oxidative stress-mediated insults mediated by catalytically active iron. In summary, MPAQ possesses an interesting pharmacological profile as it penetrates the brain parenchyma and counteracts mechanisms possibly contributive to dopaminergic cell death in Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "Pesticides have been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), and protective gloves and workplace hygiene can reduce pesticide exposure. We assessed whether use of gloves and workplace hygiene modified associations between pesticides and PD. The Farming and Movement Evaluation (FAME) study is a nested case-control study within the Agricultural Health Study. Use of protective gloves, other PPE, and hygiene practices were determined by questionnaire (69 cases and 237 controls were included). We considered interactions of gloves and hygiene with ever-use of pesticides for all pesticides with \u22655 exposed and unexposed cases and controls in each glove-use stratum (paraquat, permethrin, rotenone, and trifluralin). 61% of respondents consistently used protective gloves and 87% consistently used \u22652 hygiene practices. Protective glove use modified the associations of paraquat and permethrin with PD: neither pesticide was associated with PD among protective glove users, while both pesticides were associated with PD among non-users (paraquat OR 3.9 [95% CI 1.3, 11.7], interaction p=0.15; permethrin OR 4.3 [95% CI 1.2, 15.6] interaction p=0.05). Rotenone was associated with PD regardless of glove use. Trifluralin was associated with PD among participants who used <2 hygiene practices (OR 5.5 [95% CI 1.1, 27.1]) but was not associated with PD among participants who used 2 or more practices (interaction p=0.02). Although sample size was limited in the FAME study, protective glove use and hygiene practices appeared to be important modifiers of the association between pesticides and PD and may reduce risk of PD associated with certain pesticides.",

    "abstract": "Alpha synuclein is a 14 kDa intrinsically disordered, presynaptic protein whose fibrillation is a critical step in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). A structural investigation of the effect of escitalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) on \u03b1-synuclein was performed using ANS and ThT assays, CD, turbidity and Rayleigh scattering measurements as well as atomic force and transmission electron microscopy. Analysing the mechanism of \u03b1-synuclein fibril formation, helped us in elucidating the passage of an intermediate at 75 \u03bcM concentration of escitalopram. Fibrils of \u03b1-synuclein were obtained at 100 \u03bcM concentration of escitalopram. Inhibition of \u03b1-synuclein fibrillation was brought about by a polyphenolic acid known as caffeic acid which acted in a concentration dependent manner ranging from 10 to 60 \u03bcM. Maximum inhibition was achieved at a concentration of 60 \u03bcM. Fibrillation of \u03b1-synuclein in presence of escitalopram gives us clue for the negative effects of antidepressant. Inhibitory activity of caffeic acid against \u03b1-synuclein fibrillation may guide us in designing novel therapeutic drugs for PD.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the ATP13A2 (PARK9) gene cause early-onset, autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD) and Kufor-Rakeb syndrome. ATP13A2 mRNA is spliced into three distinct isoforms encoding a P5-type ATPase involved in regulating heavy metal transport across vesicular membranes. Here, we demonstrate that three ATP13A2 mRNA isoforms are expressed in the normal human brain and are modestly increased in the cingulate cortex of PD cases. ATP13A2 can mediate protection toward a number of stressors in mammalian cells and can protect against \u03b1-synuclein-induced toxicity in cellular and invertebrate models of PD. Using a primary cortical neuronal model combined with lentiviral-mediated gene transfer, we demonstrate that human ATP13A2 isoforms 1 and 2 display selective neuroprotective effects toward toxicity induced by manganese and hydrogen peroxide exposure through an ATPase-independent mechanism. The familial PD mutations, F182L and G504R, abolish the neuroprotective effects of ATP13A2 consistent with a loss-of-function mechanism. We further demonstrate that the AAV-mediated overexpression of human ATP13A2 is not sufficient to attenuate dopaminergic neurodegeneration, neuropathology, and striatal dopamine and motoric deficits induced by human \u03b1-synuclein expression in a rat model of PD. Intriguingly, the delivery of an ATPase-deficient form of ATP13A2 (D513N) to the substantia nigra is sufficient to induce dopaminergic neuronal degeneration and motor deficits in rats, potentially suggesting a dominant-negative mechanism of action. Collectively, our data demonstrate a distinct lack of ATP13A2-mediated protection against \u03b1-synuclein-induced neurotoxicity in the rat nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, and limited neuroprotective capacity overall, and raise doubts about the potential of ATP13A2 as a therapeutic target for PD.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of increased vocal intensity on interarticulator timing in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nTen individuals with mild to moderate hypophonia, secondary to PD, were selected for study. Over an 8-week treatment period, multi-talker babble noise was presented monaurally to the individuals with PD during everyday communication contexts to elicit increased vocal intensity (Lombard effect). Outcome measures included sound pressure level (SPL), voice onset time (VOT), VOT ratio, percent voicing, and speech intelligibility.\nGroup and individual participant responses to the treatment are reported and discussed. Speakers with PD were shown to significantly increase SPL in response to treatment. Six of the 10 speakers showed improved temporal coordination between the laryngeal and supralaryngeal mechanisms (interarticulator timing) in response to treatment. Four of the 10 speakers, however, showed reduced laryngeal\u2013supralaryngeal timing at the end of treatment. Group speech intelligibility scores were significantly higher post-treatment as compared to pre-treatment.\nVoice treatment during everyday communication resulted in improved temporal coordination across the laryngeal and supralaryngeal mechanisms for the majority of speakers with PD and made them easier to understand. Further investigations are planned to explore individual differences in response to treatment. The identification of speaker-specific voicing and devoicing strategies is consistent with the heterogeneous nature of PD.\nReaders will be able to: 1. Describe the speech and voice characteristics of individuals with Parkinson's disease. 2. Define the Lombard effect. 3. Describe acoustic measures of voice onset time and percent voicing. 4. Describe the effect of voice treatment on voice onset time and percent voicing in individuals with Parkinson's disease.",

NMF occurred on average 9.8 \u00b1 7.7 years after the onset of PD. Fifty patients (86%) with NMF had also MF and 10 (21%) had PDD. Twenty-five (44%) patients suffered from sensory, 28 (49%) from autonomic and 25 (44%) from neuropsychiatric symptoms.

    "abstract": "Genetic linkage studies and genome wide analysis have provided insights into complex medical diseases. Mycobacterium avium ss. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes Johne's disease, an important enteric inflammatory disease mostly studied in ruminant animals. MAP is also the putative cause of Crohn's disease. Moreover, MAP has been linked to other inflammatory diseases: sarcoidosis, Blau syndrome, autoimmune diabetes, autoimmune thyroiditis and multiple sclerosis. Genetic studies reveal an association between Parkinson's disease (PD), leprosy and Crohn's disease and since discovered, these findings have been considered \"surprising\". Autophagy and ubiquitin-proteosome systems are cellular systems that both fight intracellular pathogens (xenophagy) and maintain cellular protein quality control. PD is a common neurodegenerative disease that manifests clinically as a profound movement disorder. The recognized genetic defects of PD create disruption of cellular homeostasis that result in protein folding abnormalities of PD called Lewy bodies. Those same genetic defects are associated with susceptibility to intracellular pathogens, including mycobacteria. It is now understood that PD Lewy body pathology starts in the enteric nervous system and \"spreads\" to the brain in a retrograde fashion via the vagus nerve. This is the same process by which prions affect the brain. Lewy body pathology of the enteric nervous system predates the Lewy body pathology of the central nervous system (CNS) by years or even decades. This article proposes that genetic defects associated with PD also result in a permissive environment for MAP infection--ineffective xenophagy. It postulates that beginning as an enteric infection, MAP--via the vagus nerve--initiates a pathologic process that results in a targeted neuroinvasion of the CNS. The article proposes that MAP infection and resultant PD pathology are due, in the genetically at-risk and age dependant, to the consumptive exhaustion of the protein quality control systems.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder and it affects 4-5% of people age 85 years or older. The etiopathogenesis of PD is a consequence of interaction between two factors, environmental pathogens and genetic susceptibility. If an environmental agent such as a toxin or pathogen were to play a major role in the causality of PD, it would need to be something relatively ubiquitous in our environment since we cannot find a specific population at risk. On the other hand, all efforts to implicate specific genetic sequences in risk of PD were futile since the great majority of PD cases are sporadic; however, if the majority of the population is exposed to a culpable environmental factor and only 5% of the population 85 years or older manifest the disorder, this raises an important question: Why and how does vast majority of the population not manifest with PD? It seems that we should investigate the certain genome or epigenetic alterations of the unaffected 95%. This large non affected population might have PD but they are not yet symptomatic and some may not be so for at least another 10 or 20 years. To further address this issue, we should screen and study the population that have been exposed to the environmental factor but with high certainty are not yet affected. Therefore the perfect population would be non-PD subjects who are 90 years or older. We believe the following are the unmet research needs that deserve more attention in PD. (1) More genetic studies. Comparison should be between PD subjects and non-PD control subjects who are 90 years old and above. (2) Study the mechanism of action of the candidate genes, as a subsequent examination of their gene products may lead to the discovery of neuroprotective agents in the disease.",

    "abstract": "The clinical use of biotherapies in Parkinson disease already has 30 years' history. The transplantation of dopamine fetal cells in the striatum of advanced patients has proved to be relevant in some patients but randomized efficacy trials in the US have provided disappointing results. However, cell therapies might come back on stage with the use of stem cells in the future. Gene therapy is a more recent strategy relying on viral vectors able to transduce genes coding either for the enzymes that can increase neurotransmitters production or genes for trophic factors. Several approaches have been developed in PD and have been experimented in patients. Although, some of the studies have evidenced insufficient clinical benefit, other programs, such as those using dopamine replacement techniques are promising. We find fresh hope in this field that might be the future of PD treatment. It remains however that advanced PD might not be the ideal condition to properly benefit from biotherapies and there is a need of studies at earlier stages of the disease, a time where major change in the disease course might be expected.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) patients treated with dopamine agonist therapy can develop maladaptive reward-driven behaviors, known as impulse control disorder (ICD). In this study, we assessed if ICD patients have evidence of motor-impulsivity.\nWe used the stop-signal task in a cohort of patients with and without active symptoms of ICD to evaluate motor-impulsivity. Of those with PD, 12 were diagnosed with ICD symptoms (PD-ICD) and were assessed before clinical reduction of dopamine agonist medication; 12 were without symptoms of ICD [PD-control] and taking equivalent dosages of dopamine agonist. Levodopa, if present, was maintained in both settings. Groups were similar in age, duration, and severity of motor symptoms, levodopa co-therapy, and total levodopa daily dose. All were tested in the dopamine agonist medicated and acutely withdrawn (24 h) state, in a counterbalanced manner. Primary outcome measures were mean reaction time to correct go trials (go reaction time), and mean stop-signal reaction time (SSRT).\nICD patients produce faster SSRT than both Healthy Controls, and PD-Controls. Faster SSRT in ICD patients is apparent in both dopamine agonist medication states. Also, we show unique dopamine medication effects on Go Reaction time (GoRT). In dopamine agonist monotherapy patients, dopamine agonist administration speeds GoRT. Conversely, in those with levodopa co-therapy, dopamine agonist administration slows.\nPD patients with active ICD symptoms are significantly faster at stopping initiated motor actions, and this is not altered by acute dopamine agonist withdrawal. In addition, the effect of dopamine agonist on GoRT is strongly influenced by the presence or absence of levodopa, even though levodopa co-therapy does not appear to influence SSRT. We discuss these findings as they pertain to the multifaceted definition of 'impulsivity,' the lack of evidence for motor-impulsivity in PD-ICD, and dopamine effects on motor-control in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is one of the major neurodegenerative disorders with prevalence rates between 0.1 and 0.2 % in the global population and 1.8 % in people aged 64 years and over. Future incidence rates are estimated to increase within aging societies. The progressive course of Parkinson's disease is clinically characterised by bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. These limitations in motor functioning reduce the capacity to work, social participation and the clients' quality of life. Parkinson's disease causes incapacity to work and a large number of days off from work. The benefits clients expect from physiotherapy-led treatment include an improvement of gait, a better speed of motion and the decrease of fatigue and rigidity.\nA recent Cochrane review (Mehrholz et al., 2010) analysed seven randomised comparisons with 153 participants and found that treadmill training compared with no treatment improved gait speed (SMD 0.50; 95 % confidence interval [0.17 to 0.84]). A lack of evidence exists on how to reduce fatigue and rigidity. There is also need to evaluate long-term effects and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, an updated meta-analysis should include eleven new randomised trials on treadmill training after 2009. Physiotherapy-led treadmill training can easily be transferred into the German healthcare context since the environmental and educational preconditions are met by German physiotherapeutic care.\nWithin the German context, there is need to prepare a randomised clinical trial evaluating the impact of physiotherapy-led treadmill training on motor functioning, quality of life, costs, adverse events und long-term effects. Prior to this, a feasibility study should explore the acceptance and intensity of treadmill training as well as the access of private physiotherapy practices to people suffering from early- to mid-stage Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) is common and recent studies have focused on addressing the most suitable screening tool for its assessment. MMSE is commonly used in clinical practice and longitudinal studies found a relationship between the MMSE pentagon copying item and progression to dementia, but its neuroanatomical correlates have been poorly investigated. The aim of this study is to investigate the MRI structural correlates of the global MMSE and the pentagon item scores in PD patients in the absence of dementia.\nWe selected a sample of 92 PD patients and 36 controls. MMSE was used as a global measure of cognitive status, and the pentagon copying test as a measure of visuospatial performance. FreeSurfer software was used to assess intergroup differences in cortical thickness (CTh) and global atrophy measures, as well as their relationship with cognitive performance.\nCompared to controls, patients showed significant differences in measures of global atrophy, which correlated with performance on MMSE and the pentagon item.

    "abstract": "In recent years, non-motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD) have received increasing attention and PD is currently considered a systemic rather than a pure basal ganglia disorder. Among the systemic features, peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a recent acquisition since the first case-control study reporting increased frequency of PN in PD dates back to 2008.\nWe reviewed available literature on peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement in PD.\nEvidence of \u03b1-synuclein deposition in the PNS and small nerve fiber deterioration in both drug-na\u00efve and treated PD patients is becoming stronger. In addition, several recent reports documented a significant role of levodopa exposure together with group B vitamin deficiency in facilitating the development of PN and case reports suggested that treatment with continuous levodopa intestinal infusion may increase the risk of acute PN compared to both oral levodopa and other dopaminergic treatments.\nIt is currently debated whether PN is an intrinsic disease-related feature, a consequence of levodopa treatment or both. In this review, we will discuss the different hypotheses, as well as our perspective on open issues and controversies.",

    "abstract": "Caring for a person with Parkinson's disease (PwP) can have a variety of negative consequences that may challenge their ability to continue their caring role. It is still unknown why some individuals adapt better than others in response to such burdens. This review is the first to synthesize and evaluate the evidence on the predictive factors of psychosocial outcomes in PwP carers.\nStudies which identified predictors of psychosocial outcomes for unpaid carers were included. PsychINFO, EMBASE, AMED, BNI and CINAHL databases were searched, supplemented by scanning of references lists of included studies and relevant journals from 2008 onwards. Quality was assessed using the NICE methodology checklist for prognostic studies.\nTwenty-nine studies were included in the review, providing a low-level of evidence. Carer burden was investigated in 18 studies and mental health and quality of life (QoL) in seven studies each. PwP non-motor symptoms and QoL and carer depression were consistently identified as predictors for at least one psychosocial outcome. Demographics and disease factors were consistently found not to be predictors. Carer involvement and protective factors (e.g. social support, personality) demonstrated promising findings but studies were too few or factors measured inconsistently.\nConfident conclusions could not be drawn regarding the most important predictors that should be targeted in psychosocial interventions due to methodological weaknesses and lack of theoretical testing across the current literature. Future research should build upon psychological theory to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that explain how carers adapt to caregiving.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the medication effect of dopamine agonists of Parkinson disease on incidence of cancers from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database.\nWe conducted a population-based nested case-control study by using the resources of the Taiwanese National Health Insurance from 1996 to 2000 and analyzed the prevalence of cancer among patients with Parkinson disease. A nested analysis was then implemented among those patients with both Parkinson disease and cancer, focusing separately on the use of ergot- and nonergot-derived-dopamine agonists.\nWe reviewed 6211 patients with Parkinson's disease and found 329 patients with cancer. The ergot-derived dopamine agonists users were associated with an increased odds ratio for cancer, compared with nonergot-derived dopamine agonist users, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.16 (95% confidence interval, 1.55-2.99). Among all the cancer types, we observed the higher occurrence of liver cancer among the ergot-derived dopamine agonist users.\nThe association of ergot-derived-dopamine agonist use and cancers, especially the liver cancers, has provided us the information to further understand the drug-cancer interaction. We hope this result would prompt further investigations on the risk and benefit of the dopamine agonists use among the Parkinson's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a meta-analysis including 5 large genome-wide association studies has identified rs12456492 variant of RIT2 gene as a novel risk locus for Parkinson's disease (PD) in Caucasian populations. However, the association between RIT2 polymorphism and PD risk has not been positively replicated in Asian population yet. We detected the genotypes of rs12456492 in 524 PD patients and 521 control subjects from a Han Chinese population. The allele and genotype distribution of rs12456492 variant were significantly different between PD patients and controls (allele p = 0.001, genotype p = 0.002). Logistic regression analysis showed that the G-carrying genotype (AG + GG) individuals exhibited a nearly 1.4-fold increased risk for PD compared with the AA genotype carriers (OR = 1.390; 95% confidence interval = 1.079-1.791; p = 0.011). Our data support that the carriage of G allele of rs12456492 variant of RIT2 gene significantly increases the risk for PD in Han Chinese population, suggesting a potential role of RIT2 in the etiology of PD.",

    "abstract": "Swallowing disturbances are an important issue in Parkinson's disease (PD) as several studies have shown that they are associated with increased risk of aspiration pneumonia and mortality. Information about factors related to swallowing disturbances, such as disease duration, age at assessment and concomitant dementia, is limited and would be useful for their management.\nAll consecutive PD out-patients evaluated at a movement disorders clinic over a 7-year period (2007-2014), were included in the present retrospective study. Presence of symptomatic swallowing disturbances was assessed using the specific item of the Non Motor Symptom Questionnaire.\nIn the whole PD population (N\u00a0=\u00a06462), prevalence of symptomatic swallowing disturbances was 11.7% (95%CI, 10.9-12.5). Multivariable logistic regression analysis (adjusted for education) disclosed a significant interaction between disease duration and gender (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). In both gender strata, swallowing disturbances were significantly associated with longer disease duration and dementia (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for all). A significant effect for age at assessment was also found in male patients. In non-demented patients, swallowing disturbances were associated with male gender, age and disease duration (P\u00a0<\u00a00.02 for all). In demented patients an association was found only with male gender (P\u00a0=\u00a00.018) and disease duration (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nGender, age, disease duration and dementia all seem to contribute to the occurrence of swallowing disturbances independently. However, the role played by these factors in sub-groups of patients stratified by gender and concomitant dementia suggests that swallowing disturbances are likely related to different neuro-degenerative patterns within the brain. The underlying mechanisms deserve further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has been attributed to a combination of genetic and nongenetic factors. We studied a set of monozygotic twins harboring the heterozygous glucocerebrosidase mutation (GBA N370S) but clinically discordant for PD. We applied induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology for PD disease modeling using the twins' fibroblasts to evaluate and dissect the genetic and nongenetic contributions. Utilizing fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we obtained a homogenous population of \"footprint-free\" iPSC-derived midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. The mDA neurons from both twins had \u223c50% GBA enzymatic activity, \u223c3-fold elevated \u03b1-synuclein protein levels, and a reduced capacity to synthesize and release dopamine. Interestingly, the affected twin's neurons showed an even lower dopamine level, increased monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) expression, and impaired intrinsic network activity. Overexpression of wild-type GBA and treatment with MAO-B inhibitors normalized \u03b1-synuclein and dopamine levels, suggesting a combination therapy for the affected twin.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases are neurodegenerative diseases presently without effective drug treatments. AD is characterized by general cognitive impairment, difficulties with memory consolidation and retrieval, and with advanced stages episodes of agitation and anger. AD is increasing in frequency as life expectancy increases. Present FDA approved medications do little to slow disease progression and none address the underlying progressive loss of synaptic connections and neurons. New drug design approaches are needed beyond cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists. Patients with PD experience the symptomatic triad of bradykinesis, tremor-at-rest, and rigidity with the possibility of additional non-motor symptoms including sleep disturbances, depression, dementia, and autonomic nervous system failure. This review summarizes available information regarding the role of the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in learning and memory and motor functions, with particular emphasis on research results suggesting a link between angiotensin IV (AngIV) interacting with the AT4 receptor subtype. Currently there is controversy over the identity of this AT4 receptor protein. Albiston and colleagues have offered convincing evidence that it is the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). Recently members of our laboratory have presented evidence that the brain AngIV/AT4 receptor system coincides with the brain hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met receptor system. In an effort to resolve this issue we have synthesized a number of small molecule AngIV-based compounds that are metabolically stable, penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and facilitate compromised memory and motor systems. These research efforts are described along with details concerning a recently synthesized molecule, Dihexa that shows promise in overcoming memory and motor dysfunctions by augmenting synaptic connectivity via the formation of new functional synapses.",

    "abstract": "To assess, using a longitudinal follow-up study design, the relationship between the body site of motor symptoms onset and that of dyskinesias (LID) onset in 70 PD patients in whom LID were absent at the baseline but appeared at one of the follow-up visits; to investigate the demographic and clinical features associated with different sites of LID onset.\nMotor symptoms onset was retrospectively determined by asking patients which body part had first been affected by motor impairment. The site of LID onset was determined objectively in one of the follow-up visits.\nMotor symptoms started in the limbs in all patients (unilaterally in 91.4% and bilaterally in 8.6% of the patients). LID started unilaterally in the limbs in 25.8%, bilaterally in the limbs in 7.1%, in the cranio-cervical-axial region in 40% and in both the cranio-cervical-axial region and limbs in 27.1% of the patients. No significant association emerged between the site of motor symptoms onset and that of LID onset; a correlation did emerge between the site of motor symptoms onset and that of LID onset in patients with unilateral onset of both motor symptoms and LID. No differences were detected when the subgroups of patients with LID onset in different body regions were compared.\nThe partial association between the body site of motor symptoms and of LID onset likely reflects pathophysiological mechanisms underlying LID.",

Four-hundred and twenty PD patients whose motor symptoms were not well controlled by levodopa treatment were randomized 2:2:1 to receive rotigotine, ropinirole (up to 15\u00a0mg/day) or placebo during a 16-week treatment period followed by a 4-week taper period. The primary variable was change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III (ON state) sum score from baseline to the end of the treatment period.\nThe difference in the change in the UPDRS Part III (ON state) sum score from baseline to the end of treatment between rotigotine and placebo groups was\u00a0-6.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 (95% CI:\u00a0-8.7 to\u00a0-4.1; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), indicating superiority of rotigotine over placebo. The difference between rotigotine and ropinirole groups was\u00a0-1.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0 (95% CI:\u00a0-3.2 to 0.5), below the non-inferiority margin, indicating the non-inferiority of rotigotine to ropinirole. Application site reaction was seen in 57.7% of the patients in the rotigotine group and in 18.6% in the ropinirole group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). No other safety issue was noted.\nRotigotine was well tolerated at doses up to 16\u00a0mg/24\u00a0h and showed similar efficacy to ropinirole except that the application site reaction was much higher in the rotigotine group.",

    "abstract": "Although freezing of gait (FOG) is a common and disabling symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), the underlying mechanism of FOG has not been clearly elucidated. Using analysis of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we investigated anatomic structures associated with FOG in PD patients.\nWe enrolled 33 controls and 42 PD patients (19 patients with FOG and 23 without FOG). DTI data were compared between PD patients and controls, and also between PD patients with and without FOG. Whole brain voxel-based analysis and regions of interest analysis in the pedunculopontine nucleus were used for DTI analysis.\nCompared with normal controls, PD patients showed microstructural changes in various subcortical structures (substantia nigra, globus pallidum and thalamus), frontal and insula cortex. PD patients with FOG demonstrated altered mean diffusivities in subcortical structures connected with pedunculopontine nucleus, such as basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebellum in voxel-based analysis. Using region of interest analysis of pedunculopontine nucleus, fractional anisotropy values were reduced and mean diffusivity values were increased bilaterally in PD patients with FOG. In correlation analysis, the fractional anisotropy value of the right pedunculopontine nucleus was moderately correlated with the severity of FOG.\nBased on our results, microstructural changes of pedunculopontine nucleus and connected subcortical structures are closely related with FOG in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesize that GPR109A message and expression are up-regulated in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). GPR109A is a high-affinity niacin receptor. Niacin is a precursor for NAD-NADH which is needed for dopamine production. Thus, niacin supplementation may serve three purposes: reduce inflammation through GPR109A-related mechanisms, increase dopamine synthesis in the striatum through NADPH supply and increase NAD/NADH ratio to boost mitochondrial functions. GPR109A and its agonists are known to exert anti-inflammatory actions in the skin, gut and retina. However these roles are neither anticipated nor established in the CNS. For the first time here we propose the roles of GPR109A and its agonists including niacin in CNS pathology. Moreover we predict that the neuroprotective roles of either niacin or butyrates in CNS occur via GPR109A.",

    "abstract": "Various hallucinations are unpleasant for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Hallucinations are often related to anti-parkinsonian drugs. Tactile hallucinations rarely occur in patients with PD. In contrast to other types of hallucinations, tactile hallucinations often make physicians wonder if a physical abnormality is the underlying cause. However, the relation of tactile hallucinations to anti-parkinsonian drugs remains uncertain because studies are scant. We describe three patients with PD who had tactile hallucinations that were triggered by dopamine agonists. In our patients, tactile hallucinations occurred in a clear sensorium and persisted for a prolonged time. Two patients had clear visual hallucinations such as of insects, which were associated with tactile hallucinations such as of insects tied to the body. Clear tactile sensoria were unpleasant. Dopamine agonists were initiated or the doses were increased during several periods immediately before the onset of tactile hallucinations. Although the other anti-parkinsonian drugs used, such as amantadine, zonisamide, or trihexyphenidyl, were likely to be partly responsible for the tactile hallucinations, our observations suggest that an increase in the dose of dopamine agonists can trigger tactile hallucinations.",

The PD patients scored lower than controls on the EXAMINER Executive Composite, Cognitive Control, and Working Memory Scores.\nThe NIH EXAMINER Executive Composite and Cognitive Control Scores are sensitive measures of executive dysfunction in non-demented PD, and may be more sensitive than several widely used measures.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) contributes to cognitive impairment in the elderly but its effect in Parkinson disease (PD) is not well studied.\nTo investigate effects of comorbid DM on cognition in PD independent from PD-specific primary neurodegenerations.\nCross-sectional study. Patients with PD (n\u00a0=\u00a0148); age 65.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.4 years, Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6, with (n\u00a0=\u00a015) and without (n\u00a0=\u00a0133) comorbid type II DM, underwent [(11)C]methyl-4-piperidinyl propionate (PMP) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) PET imaging to assess cortical cholinergic denervation, [(11)C]dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) PET imaging to assess nigrostriatal denervation, and neuropsychological assessments. A global cognitive Z-score was calculated based on normative data. Analysis of covariance was performed to determine cognitive differences between subjects with and without DM while controlling for nigrostriatal denervation, cortical cholinergic denervation, levodopa equivalent dose and education covariates.\nThere were no significant differences in age, gender, Hoehn and Yahr stage or duration of disease between diabetic and non-diabetic PD subjects. There was a non-significant trend toward lower years of education in the diabetic PD subjects compared with non-diabetic PD subjects. PD diabetics had significantly lower mean (\u00b1SD) global cognitive Z-scores (-0.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.01) compared to the non-diabetics (-0.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.91; F\u00a0=\u00a07.78, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) when controlling for covariate effects of education, striatal dopaminergic denervation, and cortical cholinergic denervation (total model F\u00a0=\u00a08.39, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).\nDiabetes mellitus is independently associated with more severe cognitive impairment in PD likely through mechanisms other than disease-specific neurodegenerations.",

    "abstract": "Research on eating behaviours has extensively highlighted that cognitive systems interact with the metabolic system in driving food intake and in influencing body weight regulation. Parkinson's disease is a good model for studying these complex interactions since alterations in both body weight and cognitive domains have been frequently reported among these patients. Interestingly, even if different non-motor symptoms may characterize the course of the disease, their contribution to weight and food preference has been poorly investigated. This review describes body weight alterations and eating habits in patients with Parkinson's disease, including those who underwent deep brain stimulation surgery. In particular, the review considers the link between non-motor symptoms, affecting sensory perception, cognition, mood and motivation, and food intake and weight alterations. The take home message is twofold. First, we recommend a comprehensive approach in order to develop effective strategies in the management of patients' weight. Second, we also suggest that investigating this issue in patients with Parkinson's disease may provide some useful information about the mechanisms underlying food and weight regulation in healthy subjects.",

    "abstract": "Lewy body and Alzheimer-type pathologies often co-exist. Several studies suggest a synergistic relationship between amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) accumulation. We have explored the relationship between A\u03b2 accumulation and the phosphorylation of \u03b1-syn at serine-129 (pSer129 \u03b1-syn), in post-mortem human brain tissue and in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells transfected to overexpress human \u03b1-syn.\nWe measured levels of A\u03b240, A\u03b242, \u03b1-syn and pSer129 \u03b1-syn by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in soluble and insoluble fractions of midfrontal, cingulate and parahippocampal cortex and thalamus, from cases of Parkinson's disease (PD) with (PDD; n = 12) and without dementia (PDND; n = 23), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; n = 10) and age-matched controls (n = 17). We also examined the relationship of these measurements to cognitive decline, as measured by time-to-dementia and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score in the PD patients, and to Braak tangle stage.\nIn most brain regions, the concentration of insoluble pSer129 \u03b1-syn correlated positively, and soluble pSer129 \u03b1-syn negatively, with the levels of soluble and insoluble A\u03b2. Insoluble pSer129 \u03b1-syn also correlated positively with Braak stage. In most regions, the levels of insoluble and soluble A\u03b2 and the proportion of insoluble \u03b1-syn that was phosphorylated at Ser129 were significantly higher in the PD and DLB groups than the controls, and higher in the PDD and DLB groups than the PDND brains. In PD, the MMSE score correlated negatively with the level of insoluble pSer129 \u03b1-syn. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to aggregated A\u03b242 significantly increased the proportion of \u03b1-syn that was phosphorylated at Ser129 (aggregated A\u03b240 exposure had a smaller, non-significant effect).\nTogether, these data show that the concentration of pSer129 \u03b1-syn in brain tissue homogenates is directly related to the level of A\u03b2 and Braak tangle stage, and predicts cognitive status in Lewy body diseases.",

    "abstract": "Impulsive and compulsive behaviors (ICBs) are a heterogeneous group of conditions that may be caused by long-term dopaminergic replacement therapy (DRT) of Parkinson's disease (PD). The spectrum of ICBs includes dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), punding, and impulse control disorders (ICDs).\nWe made a detailed review regarding the epidemiology, pathology, clinical characteristics, risk factors, diagnosis as well as treatment of ICBs.\nThe prevalence of ICBs in PD patients is approximately 3-4% for DDS, 0.34-4.2% for punding, and 6-14% for ICDs, with higher prevalence in Western populations than in Asian. Those who take high dose of levodopa are more prone to have DDS, whereas, ICDs are markedly associated with dopamine agonists. Different subtypes of ICBs share many risk factors such as male gender, higher levodopa equivalent daily dose, younger age at PD onset, history of alcoholism, impulsive, or novelty-seeking personality. The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorder in Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale seems to be a rather efficacious instrument to obtain relevant information from patients and caregivers. Treatment of ICBs is still a great challenge for clinicians. Readjustment of DRT remains the primary method. Atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, amantadine, and psychosocial interventions are also prescribed in controlling episodes of psychosis caused by compulsive DRT, but attention should be drawn to balance ICBs symptoms and motor disorders. Moreover, deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus might be a potential method in controlling ICBs.\nThe exact pathophysiological mechanisms of ICBs in PD remains poorly understood. Further researches are needed not only to study the pathogenesis, prevalence, features, and risk factors of ICBs, but to find efficacious therapy for patients with these devastating consequences.",

    "results": "The prevalence of ICBs in PD patients is approximately 3-4% for DDS, 0.34-4.2% for punding, and 6-14% for ICDs, with higher prevalence in Western populations than in Asian. Those who take high dose of levodopa are more prone to have DDS, whereas, ICDs are markedly associated with dopamine agonists. Different subtypes of ICBs share many risk factors such as male gender, higher levodopa equivalent daily dose, younger age at PD onset, history of alcoholism, impulsive, or novelty-seeking personality. The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorder in Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale seems to be a rather efficacious instrument to obtain relevant information from patients and caregivers. Treatment of ICBs is still a great challenge for clinicians. Readjustment of DRT remains the primary method. Atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, amantadine, and psychosocial interventions are also prescribed in controlling episodes of psychosis caused by compulsive DRT, but attention should be drawn to balance ICBs symptoms and motor disorders. Moreover, deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus might be a potential method in controlling ICBs.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) produces progressive nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) denervation resulting in cognitive and motor impairment. However, it is unknown whether cognitive impairments, such as instrumental learning deficits, are associated with the early stage PD-induced mild DA denervation. The current study sought to model early PD-induced instrumental learning impairments by assessing the effects of low dose (5.5\u03bcg), bilateral 6OHDA-induced striatal DA denervation on acquisition of instrumental stimulus discrimination in rats. 6OHDA (n=20) or sham (n=10) lesioned rats were tested for stimulus discrimination acquisition either 1 or 2 weeks post surgical lesion. Stimulus discrimination acquisition across 10 daily sessions was used to assess discriminative accuracy, or a probability measure of the shift toward reinforced responding under one stimulus condition (Sd) away from extinction, when reinforcement was withheld, under another (S(d) phase). Striatal DA denervation was assayed by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) staining intensity. Results indicated that 6OHDA lesions produced significant loss of dorsal striatal TH staining intensity and marked impairment in discrimination acquisition, without inducing akinetic motor deficits. Rather 6OHDA-induced impairment was associated with perseveration during extinction (S(\u0394) phase). These findings suggest that partial, bilateral striatal DA denervation produces instrumental learning deficits, prior to the onset of gross motor impairment, and suggest that the current model is useful for investigating mild nigrostriatal DA denervation associated with early stage clinical PD.",

    "abstract": "There is evidence that nigrostriatal pathology may at least partly underlie mild Parkinsonian signs. We evaluated whether an increase in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) could be predicted by the presence of risk and prodromal markers for neurodegenerative diseases in elderly individuals without those diseases. Therefore, we analyzed the UPDRS-III score and various risk and prodromal markers known to antecede neurodegenerative diseases in a population-based cohort comprising 807 individuals free of neurodegenerative diseases at baseline. After 5 years, eight persons (1.0 %) were diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Of those, seven (87.5 %) had motor worsening \u22653 points on the UPDRS-III from baseline to follow-up, one had two points increase. Of the 788 people without PD, 568 (72.1 %) showed no increase in the UPDRS-III scale, 220 (27.9 %) had \u22651 point increase and out of these 104 (13.2 %) had an increase of \u22653 points in the UPDRS-III score after 5 years. We identified an age >60 years (relative risk, RR = 1.7; confidence interval, CI 1.3-2.1) and the occurrence of \u22652 risk factors (RR = 1.5; CI 1.2-1.9) as possible predictors of motor progression. After 5 years, individuals with an increase in the UPDRS-III score had more often a one-sided reduced arm swing (p < 0.001) and identified less odors in the Sniffin' sticks test (p < 0.041) than persons with stable motor performance. Our data support the assumption that progression of Parkinsonian signs assessed by the UPDRS-III parallels the development of prodromal markers for neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly population.",

    "abstract": "Overexpression of human \u03b1-synuclein gene in Drosophila can reduce lifespan, and we have performed lifespan assay for A30P and A53T\u03b1-synuclein transgenic and control (elav-GAL4, UAS-A30P, UAS-A53T) flies. Our results showed reduced lifespan of transgenic flies compared to controls. We have also investigated behavioral responses, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) and activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in a combined genetic-toxin model (Ethanol-A30P or A53T\u03b1-synuclein models) and controls. Our results showed that sedation time (ST50) of A30P or A53T\u03b1-synuclein PD model flies was significantly lower while recovery time (RC50) of them was remarkably higher compared to control flies. The levels of oxidative markers (ROS and LPO) were significantly higher and the activities of CAT and SOD were lower in transgenic flies that underwent ethanol exposure compared to control. Based on our earlier studies on antioxidant properties of isolated and characterized molecules from Decalepis hamiltonii (Dh) root extract, its protective effect in this combined toxicity model has been investigated. Surprisingly, Dh treatment increased ST50 and decreased RC50 values of transgenic flies. Moreover, we showed that Dh pre-treatment could decrease the levels of ROS and LPO and increase the activities of CAT and SOD in the ethanol-\u03b1-synuclein model. This is the first report on protective effects of natural antioxidants in A30P or A53T\u03b1-synuclein PD model flies against oxidative stress induced by ethanol.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated kinematics of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and age-matched controls during cued and uncued reaching movements. Maximum hand velocity, its variability and shoulder-to-shoulder coupling, quantified by phase locking value (PLV), were compared between PD (n=14) and Control (n=4). The PD group achieved significantly lower maximum hand velocities during the reaching movement in comparison to the Control group (p=0.05), whereas the Control group exhibited significantly greater variability (i.e., larger SDs) of maximum hand velocities across the blocks than the PD group (p=0.01). Persons with PD exhibited higher PLVs than the healthy elderly individuals when performing reaching movements with their dominant side (p=0.05), while the PLVs did not differ between groups when the movements were performed with their non-dominant hand. The present study suggests that persons with PD have a reduced ability to: (1) modulate maximum reaching velocity; and (2) alter coordination across the shoulders to different reaching actions. In persons with PD, the velocity-oriented (dominant) limb becomes slowed and less flexible, to the point that its movement dynamics are effectively similar to that of the position-oriented (non-dominant) limb.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by alterations of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotransmission. Compared to the wealth of data on the impairment of the dopamine system, relatively limited evidence is available concerning the role of major non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in PD. Therefore, we comprehensively investigated the density and distribution of neurotransmitter receptors for glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, adrenaline, serotonin, dopamine and adenosine in brains of homozygous aphakia mice being characterized by mutations affecting the Pitx3 gene. This genetic model exhibits crucial hallmarks of PD on the neuropathological, symptomatic and pharmacological level. Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to characterize 19 different receptor binding sites in eleven brain regions in order to understand receptor changes on a systemic level. We demonstrated striking differential changes of neurotransmitter receptor densities for numerous receptor types and brain regions, respectively. Most prominent, a strong up-regulation of GABA receptors and associated benzodiazepine binding sites in different brain regions and concomitant down-regulations of striatal nicotinic acetylcholine and serotonergic receptor densities were found. Furthermore, the densities of glutamatergic kainate, muscarinic acetylcholine, adrenergic \u03b11 and dopaminergic D2/D3 receptors were differentially altered. These results present novel insights into the expression of neurotransmitter receptors in Pitx3(ak) mice supporting findings on PD pathology in patients and indicating on the possible underlying mechanisms. The data suggest Pitx3(ak) mice as an appropriate new model to investigate the role of neurotransmitter receptors in PD. Our study highlights the relevance of non-dopaminergic systems in PD and for the understanding of its molecular pathology.",

GM volume loss was observed in the right hippocampus, right cuneus, and right precuneus in PD-NC compared to in the HC. PD-MCI had significantly decreased GM volume in the bilateral temporal and frontal areas compared with that of the HC. The GM volume was significantly decreased in the right temporal pole, left precuneus, medial frontal and posterior cingulated gyrus in PD-MCI compared with PD-NC.\nClinical dementia ratings and global deterioration scales could differentiate PD-MCI from PD-NC.

    "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) releasing midbrain neurons are essential for multiple brain functions, such as voluntary movement, working memory, emotion and cognition. DA midbrain neurons within the substantia nigra (SN) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) exhibit a variety of distinct axonal projections and cellular properties, and are differentially affected in diseases like schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson's disease (PD). Apart from having diverse functions in health and disease states, DA midbrain neurons display distinct electrical activity patterns, crucial for DA release. These activity patterns are generated and modulated by specific sets of ion channels. Recently, two ion channels have been identified, not only contributing to these activity patterns and to functional properties of DA midbrain neurons, but also seem to render SN DA neurons particularly vulnerable to degeneration in PD and its animal models: L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) and ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K-ATPs). In this review, we focus on the emerging physiological and pathophysiological roles of these two ion channels (and their complex interplay with other ion channels), particularly in highly vulnerable SN DA neurons, as selective degeneration of these neurons causes the major motor symptoms of PD.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation has long been associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) but the extent to which it is a cause or consequence is sill debated. Over the past decade a number of genes have been implicated in PD. Relatively rare missense mutations in genes such as LRRK2, Parkin, SNCA and PINK1 are causative for familial PD whereas more common variation in genes, including LRRK2, SNCA and GBA, comprise risk factors for sporadic PD. Determining how the function of these genes and the proteins they encode are altered in PD has become a priority, as results will likely provide much needed insights into contributing causes. Accumulating evidence indicates that many of these genes function in pathways that regulate aspects of immunity, particularly inflammation, suggesting close associations between PD and immune homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Although dopaminergic replacement therapy is believed to improve sensory processing in PD, while delayed perceptual speed is thought to be caused by a predominantly cholinergic deficit, it is unclear whether sensory-perceptual deficits are a result of corrupt sensory processing, or a delay in updating perceived feedback during movement. The current study aimed to examine these two hypotheses by manipulating visual flow speed and dopaminergic medication to examine which influenced distance estimation in PD. Fourteen PD and sixteen HC participants were instructed to estimate the distance of a remembered target by walking to the position the target formerly occupied. This task was completed in virtual reality in order to manipulate the visual flow (VF) speed in real time. Three conditions were carried out: (1) BASELINE: VF speed was equal to participants' real-time movement speed; (2) SLOW: VF speed was reduced by 50 %; (2) FAST: VF speed was increased by 30 %. Individuals with PD performed the experiment in their ON and OFF state. PD demonstrated significantly greater judgement error during BASELINE and FAST conditions compared to HC, although PD did not improve their judgement error during the SLOW condition. Additionally, PD had greater variable error during baseline compared to HC; however, during the SLOW conditions, PD had significantly less variable error compared to baseline and similar variable error to HC participants. Overall, dopaminergic medication did not significantly influence judgement error. Therefore, these results suggest that corrupt processing of sensory information is the main contributor to sensory-perceptual deficits during movement in PD rather than delayed updating of sensory feedback.",

    "abstract": "Our study was intended to demonstrate the different signal intensity (SI) pattern of the putamen seen on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) between that of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Parkinsonism-predominant multiple system atrophy (MSA-P), and to correlate it with (18)F-flurodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET). Thirty patients with PD and 17 with MSA-P underwent SWI, and (18)F-FDG PET were included. The SI was measured on SWI in the anterior and posterior halves of the putamen using a region-of-interest (ROI) on both sides. The normalized regional glucose metabolism (standardized uptake value ratio, SUVR) was measured on co-registered (18)F-FDG PET images using the ROI obtained with SWI. Analysis included a group-level comparison of the SI values obtained on SWI, and these results were correlated with the SUVR on (18)F-FDG PET. The SIs of the bilateral posterior, dominant-side of the posterior, mean values of the bilateral anterior and posterior halves of the putamen on SWI, differed significantly between the two groups (P < 0.001, respectively). The SUVR of the all locations also differed significantly between PD and MSA-P (P < 0.001, respectively). There was a moderate degree of positive correlation between the SI and the SUVR of the left posterior half, and mean value of the bilateral posterior putamen in MSA-P (r = 0.634, P = 0.006, r = 0.492, P = 0.045). In conclusion, the low SI seen on the posterior putamen may differentiate MSA-P from PD. Furthermore, low SI in the putamen correlated with hypometabolism on (18)F-FDG PET. Therefore, SWI could be a potential complementary diagnostic tool to (18)F-FDG PET for differentiating these conditions.",

The patients were observed in a five-year period (2006-2011). They underwent Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing, Functional Oral Intake Scale and therapeutic intervention every three months. In the therapeutic intervention they received orientation about exercises to improve swallowing. The Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher's tests were used. The period of time for improvement or worsening of swallowing was described by Kaplan-Meier analysis.\nDuring the follow-up, ten patients improved, five stayed the same and nine worsened their swallowing functionality. The median time for improvement was ten months. Prior to the worsening there was a median time of 33 months of follow-up. There was no associated factor with improvement or worsening of swallowing. The maneuvers frequently indicated in therapeutic intervention were: chin-tuck, bolus consistency, bolus effect, strengthening-tongue, multiple swallows and vocal exercises.\nThe swallowing management was characterized by swallowing assessment every three months with indication of compensatory and rehabilitation maneuvers, aiming to maintain the oral feeding without risks.

    "abstract": "Gait deficits are important clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) but are rarely studied. In this study we made three different rat PD models by administration of 6-hydroxydopamine into caudate putamen (CPU), medial forebrain bundle (MFB) and substantia nigra compact (SNC). We evaluated the gait changes in these models by using a computer-assisted CatWalk system. Correlations of gait parameters with tyrosine hydroxylase protein levels in the CPU and SNC were also investigated. The gait readouts were significantly impaired in both the MFB and SNC groups. However, the MFB group showed a more pronounced impairment than the SNC group. In contrast, only mild and incomplete gait impairment occurred in the CPU group. In addition, some gait parameters demonstrated close correlation with the protein levels of TH. This paper suggests that the 6-hydroxydopamine-induced MFB model is more propitious to study gait dysfunction than the other two models and the CatWalk system can provide reliable and objective criteria to stratify gait changes arising from 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats. These findings may hold promise in the study of PD disease progression and new therapeutic methods.",

    "abstract": "l-DOPA is the gold standard for treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the drug produces some serious side effects, including dyskinesia, which is characterized by repetitive involuntary movements-including chorea. In the present preclinical study using a nonhuman primate model, dyskinesia caused by repeated l-DOPA administration was investigated in the context of behavioral sensitization by objectively quantifying motor activity in the common marmoset of PD model (the Parkinsonian marmoset). Twelve male Parkinsonian marmosets previously treated with MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) and six intact male marmosets were used. The motor activity of each marmoset was measured using infrared sensors attached to each individual living cage. Parkinsonian marmosets (n=6) exhibited behavioral sensitization (enhanced motor activity) in 10weeks upon oral administration of l-DOPA (10mg/kg per day on 3days/week). These animals also exhibited dyskinesia characterized by repetitive rapid movements including chorea in 6-10weeks. Neither behavioral sensitization nor dyskinesia was observed in Parkinsonian marmosets given vehicle and in intact marmosets given l-DOPA at the same dose (both n=6 each). Behavioral sensitization was detected sensitively and objectively on motor activity only in Parkinsonian marmosets given repeated l-DOPA at a similar dose used in PD patients. The behavioral feature of the marmosets was dyskinesia similar to that of PD patients but appeared earlier than would be manifested in humans. In spite of statistically significant behavioral sensitization, some marmosets did not exhibit dyskinesia in the present limited l-DOPA administration period. Although both commonalities and differences may exist between behavioral sensitization and dyskinesia, behavioral sensitization is considered to be an objective, quantitative, sensitive and predictive measure of behavioral mechanism underlying dyskinesia in preclinical studies in evaluating compounds.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation provides benefits for people with Parkinson disease by managing some of their complications. None of the few reports in the current literature establishes the functionality of deep brain stimulation when activated during phacoemulsification.\nA 70-year-old woman with subthalamic deep brain stimulator (DBS) for advanced Parkinson disease was referred to our center for cataract surgery. To evaluate any possible interference between ultrasounds and the DBS, we registered the impedance of the electrodes before and after surgery.\nThe patient underwent uneventful phacoemulsification of her right eye under topical anesthesia with her internal pulse generator device activated. During the surgical procedure, all potential variations of the impedance of the electrodes were recorded.\nThis report demonstrates that phacoemulsification under topical anesthesia is a feasible procedure in patients with DBS, showing no interference between the ultrasounds and the internal pulse generator.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without atonia (RWA) and Parkinson's disease (PD) progression.\nWe quantified tonic and phasic RWA by performing polysomnography in 198 PD patients. We then correlated the extent of RWA with clinical patient characteristics.\nPD patients were categorized into quartiles of tonic and phasic RWA. We found that patients with more RWA tended to be older and have longer PD duration, a greater likelihood of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), more advanced Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage, a higher dose of parkinsonian medication, poorer cognitive performance, worse quality of life, and more severe sleep disturbance. After adjusting for age, sex, and PD duration, patients in the highest two RWA quartile were more likely to have severe PD (H&Y stage \u2a7e 3.0) than those in the lowest RWA quartile.\nThese findings provide evidence that RWA, especially with regard to tonic muscle activity, is associated with PD severity.\nFurther studies are warranted to determine the importance and utility of assessing RWA to evaluate sleep in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies in our laboratory revealed the neuroprotective effect of modified Yeoldahanso-tang (MYH) in models of Parkinson\u05f3s disease (PD). In this study, we investigated another traditional Korean herbal formula, modified Chungsimyeolda-tang (termed DG), as a potential treatment for PD. Chungsimyeolda-tang has been used in Korea to treat cerebrovascular diseases, such as stroke. Here, we verify the neuroprotective and autophagy-inducing effects of DG to evaluate any potential anti-parkinsonian properties.\n1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) and rotenone were used to induce cytotoxicity in nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Cell viability was measured using an MTT assay. Induction of autophagy by DG in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells was measured using an immunoblotting assay with an LC3 antibody. The proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin was used to induce ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) dysfunction in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. DG-mediated clearance of aggregated proteins was measured using an immunoblotting assay with a ubiquitin antibody.\nOur findings indicate that DG robustly protects NGF-differentiated PC12 cells against the neurotoxic effects of MPP(+) and rotenone in an in vitro model. Furthermore, DG protects NGF-differentiated PC12 cells against lactacystin-induced cell death. This effect is partially mediated by an increased autophagy associated with the enhanced degradation of aggregated proteins. This study suggests that DG is an attractive candidate drug for inducing autophagy and, therefore, may represent a promising strategy to prevent diseases associated with misfolded/aggregated proteins in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson\u05f3s disease.",

    "abstract": "Ligusticum officinale (Makino) Kitag (L. officinale) is one of the important traditional herbs used in traditional Oriental medicine for the treatment of various disorders including pain and inflammation. However, there is limited scientific basis for its activity and mechanism in brain inflammation.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the effects of L. officinale on microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and behavioral impairments using in vitro cellular and in vivo mouse model of PD, as well as investigate the molecular mechanisms involved including the finger printing analysis of its ethanol extract.\nLipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to stimulate BV-2 microglial cells. The changes in neuroinflammatory expressional levels were measured by Western blotting and immunofluorescence techniques. 1-methyl-4 phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated mice model of PD was developed to evaluate the behavioral impairments and the brain tissues were used for immunohistochemical studies. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique was performed for finger printing analysis of L. officinale extract used in the study.\nL. officinale significantly attenuated the LPS-stimulated increase in inflammatory mediators in BV-2 cells. L. officinale also inhibited the LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappa beta by blocking the degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 and suppressing the increase in p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in BV-2 cells. Furthermore, L. officinale exhibited significant antioxidant properties by inhibiting the 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals. An in vivo evaluation in MPTP (20mg/kg, four times, 1 day, i.p.) intoxicated mice resulted in brain microglial activation and significant behavioral deficits. Prophylactic treatment with L. officinale prevented microglial activation and attenuated PD-like behavioral changes as assessed by the pole test. HPLC finger printing analysis revealed that L. officinale extract contained ferulic acid (FA) as one of the major constituents compared with reference standard. FA also inhibited the LPS-stimulated excessive release of NO and suppressed the increased the expressional levels of proinflammatory mediators in BV-2 microglia.\nThe findings observed in this study indicated that L. officinale extract significantly attenuated the neuroinflammatory processes in stimulated microglia and restored the behavioral impairments in a mouse model of PD providing a scientific basis for its traditional claims.",

    "abstract": "For all its imperfections at treating Parkinson's disease (PD), orally-administered levodopa (l-dopa) can be regarded as the \"platinum\" standard of PD therapeutics for its impact on disability and discomfort and its cost-effectiveness. The past half-century has confirmed that the typical l-dopa-treated patient gains improvement for most Parkinsonian features, presumably by conversion of this amino acid into dopamine in the striatum. However, fundamental questions remain as to its full mechanism of action and how adverse reactions evolve. Various aspects of clinical phenomenology associated with chronic l-dopa use (such as dyskinesias and the long-duration anti-Parkinsonian response) present a continuing challenge for better understanding of its pharmacology. The pharmacokinetics of l-dopa tend to predict some of problems that can emerge during chronic therapy, which can be linked with its irregular uptake and marked dose-by-dose variability in plasma concentrations. Several new pharmaceutical approaches are targeted at the unique physiology of l-dopa uptake and are likely to improve the consistency of its anti-Parkinsonian effect.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is central to the pathology of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), and therapeutics designed to enhance antioxidant potential could have clinical value. In this study, we investigated whether dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has therapeutic effects in cellular and animal model of PD, and explore the role of nuclear transcription factor related to NF-E2 (Nrf2) in this process. Treatment of animals and dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells with DMF resulted in increased nuclear levels of active Nrf2, with subsequent upregulation of antioxidant target genes. The cytotoxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was reduced by pre-treatment with DMF in SH-SY5Y cells. The increase in the reactive oxygen species caused by 6-OHDA treatment was also attenuated by DMF in SH-SY5Y cells. The neuroprotective effects of DMF against 6-OHDA neurotoxicity were dependent on Nrf2, since treatment with Nrf2 siRNA failed to block against 6-OHDA neurotoxicity and induce Nrf2-dependent cytoprotective genes in SH-SY5Y cells. In vivo, DMF oral administration was shown to upregulate mRNA and protein levels of Nrf2 and Nrf2-regulated cytoprotective genes, attenuate 6-OHDA induced striatal oxidative stress and inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, DMF ameliorated dopaminergic neurotoxicity in 6-OHDA-induced PD animal models as evidenced by amelioration of locomotor dysfunction, loss in striatal dopamine, and reductions in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that DMF may be beneficial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like PD.",

    "abstract": "Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) can precede onset of motor symptoms. Relationship between premotor symptoms onset and motor features is limited. Our aim is to describe the presence and perceived onset of NMS in PD as well as their possible association with motor phenotype. Presence and onset of NMS were assessed by a custom-made questionnaire in 109 newly diagnosed untreated PD patients and 107 controls from 11 Spanish and Austrian centers. Seventeen of thirty-one NMS were more common in patients than controls (P\u2009<\u20090.05). They were usually mild and frequently reported to occur at different time-spans before motor symptoms. Anhedonia, apathy, memory complaints, and inattention occurred more frequently during the 2-year premotor period. Those reported more frequently in the 2- to 10-year premotor period were smell loss, mood disturbances, taste loss, excessive sweating, fatigue, and pain. Constipation, dream-enacting behavior, excessive daytime sleepiness, and postprandial fullness were frequently perceived more than 10 years before motor symptoms. No correlation between NMS burden and motor severity, age, or gender was observed. NMS associated in four clusters: rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder symptoms-constipation, cognition-related, mood-related, and sensory clusters. No cluster was associated with a specific motor phenotype or severity. NMS are common in early unmedicated PD and frequently reported to occur in the premotor period. They are generally mild, but a patient subgroup showed high NMS burden mainly resulting from cognition-related symptoms. Certain NMS when present at the time of assessment or in the premotor stage, either alone or in combination, allowed discriminating PD from controls.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia are critically involved in language control (LC) processes, allowing a bilingual to utter correctly in one language without interference from the non-requested language. It has been hypothesized that the neural mechanism of LC closely resembles domain-general executive control (EC). The purpose of the present study is to investigate the integrity of bilingual LC and its overlap with domain-general EC in a clinical population such as individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), notoriously associated with structural damage in the basal ganglia. We approach these issues in two ways. First, we employed a language switching task to investigate the integrity of LC in a group of Catalan-Spanish bilingual individuals with PD, as compared to a group of matched healthy controls. Second, to test the relationship between domain-general EC and LC we compared the performances of individuals with PD and healthy controls also in a non-linguistic switching task. We highlight that, compared to controls, individuals with PD report decreased processing speed, less accuracy and larger switching costs in terms of RT and errors in the language switching task, whereas in the non-linguistic switching task PD patients showed only increased switching cost in terms of errors. However, we report a positive correlation between the magnitudes of linguistic and non-linguistic mixing costs in individuals with PD. Taken together, these results support the notion of a critical role of the basal ganglia and connected structures in LC, and suggest a possible link between LC and domain-general EC.",

    "abstract": "Previous research suggests that different aspects of tool knowledge are mediated by different memory systems. It is believed that tool attributes (e.g., function, color) are represented as declarative memory while skill learning is supported by procedural memory. It has been proposed that other aspects (e.g., skilled tool use) may rely on an interaction of both declarative and procedural memory. However, the specific form of procedural memory underlying skilled tool use and the nature of interaction between declarative and procedural memory systems remain unclear. In the current study, individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy controls were trained over 2 sessions, 3 weeks apart, to use a set of novel complex tools. They were also tested on their ability to recall tool attributes as well as their ability to demonstrate grasp and use of the tools to command. Results showed that, compared to controls, participants with PD showed intact motor skill acquisition and tool use to command within sessions, but failed to retain performance across sessions. In contrast, people with PD showed equivalent recall of tool attributes and tool grasping relative to controls, both within and across sessions. Current findings demonstrate that the frontal-striatal network, compromised in PD, mediates long-term retention of motor skills. Intact initial skill learning raises the possibility of compensation from declarative memory for frontal-striatal dysfunction. Lastly, skilled tool use appears to rely on both memory systems which may reflect a cooperative interaction between the two systems. Current findings regarding memory representations of tool knowledge and skill learning may have important implications for delivery of rehabilitation programs for individuals with PD.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are vulnerable to dementia and frequently experience memory deficits. This could be the result of dopamine dysfunction in corticostriatal networks (salience, central executive networks, and striatum) and/or the medial temporal lobe. Our aim was to investigate whether dopamine dysfunction in these regions contributes to memory impairment in PD.\nWe used positron emission tomography imaging to compare D2 receptor availability in the cortex and striatal (limbic and associative) dopamine neuron integrity in 4 groups: memory-impaired PD (amnestic MCI; n\u2009=\u20099), PD with nonamnestic MCI (n\u2009=\u200910), PD without MCI (n\u2009=\u200911), and healthy controls (n\u2009=\u200914). Subjects were administered a full neuropsychological test battery for cognitive performance.\nMemory-impaired patients demonstrated more significant reductions in D2 receptor binding in the salience network (insular cortex and anterior cingulate cortex [ACC] and the right parahippocampal gyrus [PHG]) compared to healthy controls and patients with no MCI. They also presented reductions in the right insula and right ACC compared to nonamnestic MCI patients. D2 levels were correlated with memory performance in the right PHG and left insula of amnestic patients and with executive performance in the bilateral insula and left ACC of all MCI patients. Associative striatal dopamine denervation was significant in all PD patients.\nDopaminergic differences in the salience network and the medial temporal lobe contribute to memory impairment in PD. Furthermore, these findings indicate the vulnerability of the salience network in PD and its potential role in memory and executive dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "GDNF is indispensible for adult catecholaminergic neuron survival, and failure of GDNF signaling has been linked to loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study demonstrates attenuated GDNF signaling in neurons deficient in ganglio-series gangliosides, and restoration of such signaling with LIGA20, a membrane permeable analog of GM1. GM1 is shown to associate in situ with GFR\u03b11 and RET, the protein components of the GDNF receptor, this being necessary for assembly of the tripartite receptor complex. Mice wholly or partially deficient in GM1 due to disruption of the B4galnt1 gene developed PD symptoms based on behavioral and neuropathological criteria which were largely ameliorated by gene therapy with AAV2-GDNF and also with LIGA20 treatment. The nigral neurons of PD subjects that were severely deficient in GM1 showed subnormal levels of tyrosine phosphorylated RET. Also in PD brain, GM1 levels in the occipital cortex, a region of limited PD pathology, were significantly below age-matched controls, suggesting the possibility of systemic GM1 deficiency as a risk factor in PD. This would accord with our finding that mice with partial GM1 deficiency represent a faithful recapitulation of the human disease. Together with the previously demonstrated age-related decline of GM1 in human brain, this points to gradual development of subthreshold levels of GM1 in the brain of PD subjects below that required for effective GDNF signaling. This hypothesis offers a dramatically different explanation for the etiology of sporadic PD as a manifestation of acquired resistance to GDNF.",

    "abstract": "In this study we report on the outcome including overall and cause-specific mortality of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients subsequent to 38 years of surveillance. This is an extension study of our previous report on mortality.\nTwo hundred thirty-seven patients with a symptom onset between 1974 and 1984 were followed until the date of December 31, 2012 or death, representing a follow-up period of up to 38 years. Overall and cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, and predictors for survival at disease onset were estimated.\nTwo hundred thirty patients had died by December 31, 2012; a total of 3,489 person-years were available for observation. The SMR at 38 years of follow-up was 2.02 (1.76-2.29). Employing Cox's proportional hazard modeling, male sex, gait disorder, absence of classical rest tremor, and absence of asymmetry predicted poor survival in this cohort. Increased cause-specific SMRs were found for pneumonia and cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Although deep brain electrical stimulation can alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD), just a small fraction of patients with PD can take advantage of this procedure due to its invasive nature. A significantly less invasive method--epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS)--has been suggested as an alternative approach for symptomatic treatment of PD. However, the mechanisms underlying motor improvements through SCS are unknown. Here, we show that SCS reproducibly alleviates motor deficits in a primate model of PD. Simultaneous neuronal recordings from multiple structures of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loop in parkinsonian monkeys revealed abnormal highly synchronized neuronal activity within each of these structures and excessive functional coupling among them. SCS disrupted this pathological circuit behavior in a manner that mimics the effects caused by pharmacological dopamine replacement therapy or deep brain stimulation. These results suggest that SCS should be considered as an additional treatment option for patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Many agents developed for neuroprotective treatment of Parkinson disease (PD) have shown great promise in the laboratory, but none have translated to positive results in patients with PD. Potential neuroprotective drugs, such as ubiquinone, creatine and PYM50028, have failed to show any clinical benefits in recent high-profile clinical trials. This 'failure to translate' is likely to be related primarily to our incomplete understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying PD, and excessive reliance on data from toxin-based animal models to judge which agents should be selected for clinical trials. Restricted resources inevitably mean that difficult compromises must be made in terms of trial design, and reliable estimation of efficacy is further hampered by the absence of validated biomarkers of disease progression. Drug development in PD dementia has been mostly unsuccessful; however, emerging biochemical, genetic and pathological evidence suggests a link between tau and amyloid-\u03b2 deposition and cognitive decline in PD, potentially opening up new possibilities for therapeutic intervention. This Review discusses the most important 'druggable' disease mechanisms in PD, as well as the most-promising drugs that are being evaluated for their potential efficiency in treatment of motor and cognitive impairments in PD.",

    "abstract": "A number of sensory changes occur in the earliest stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), some of which precede the expression of the classic motor phenotype by years (e.g., olfactory dysfunction). Whether point pressure sensitivity (PPS), a cutaneous measure of light touch mediated by myelinated A\u03b2 fibers, is altered in early PD is not clear. Prior studies on this point are contradictory and are based on non-forced-choice threshold tests that confound the sensitivity measure with the response criterion. While \u03b1-synuclein pathology, a defining feature of PD, is present in the skin of PD patients, it is restricted to unmyelinated nerve fibers, suggesting PPS may be spared in this disease. We determined PPS thresholds using a state-of-the-art forced-choice staircase threshold test paradigm in 29 early stage PD patients and 29 matched controls at 11 body sites: the center of the forehead and the left and right forearms, index fingers, palms, medial soles of the feet, and plantar halluces. The patients were tested, in counterbalanced sessions, both on and off dopamine-related medications (DRMs). PPS was not influenced by PD and did not correlate with DRM l-DOPA equivalents, scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, side of the major motor disturbances, or SPECT imaging of the striatal dopamine transporter, as measured by technetium-99m TRODAT. However, PPS thresholds were lower on the left than on the right side of the body (p=0.008) and on the upper extremities relative to the toes and feet (ps<0.0001). Positive correlations were evident among the thresholds obtained across all body sectors, even though disparate regions of the body differed in terms of absolute sensitivity. This study indicates that PPS is not influenced in early stage PD regardless of whether patients are on or off DRMs.",

    "abstract": "Aging is considered as one of the main factors promoting the risk for Parkinson's disease (PD), and common mechanisms of dopamine neuron degeneration in aging and PD have been proposed in recent years. Here, we use a statistical meta-analysis of human brain transcriptomics data to investigate potential mechanistic relationships between adult brain aging and PD pathogenesis at the pathway and network level. The analyses identify statistically significant shared pathway and network alterations in aging and PD and an enrichment in PD-associated sequence variants from genome-wide association studies among the jointly deregulated genes. We find robust discriminative patterns for groups of functionally related genes with potential applications as combined risk biomarkers to detect aging- and PD-linked oxidative stress, e.g., a consistent over-expression of metallothioneins matching with findings in previous independent studies. Interestingly, analyzing the regulatory network and mouse knockout expression data for NR4A2, a transcription factor previously associated with rare mutations in PD and here found as the most significantly under-expressed gene in PD among the jointly altered genes, suggests that aging-related NR4A2 expression changes may increase PD risk via downstream effects similar to disease-linked mutations and to expression changes in sporadic PD. Overall, the analyses suggest mechanistic explanations for the age-dependence of PD risk and reveal significant and robust shared process alterations with potential applications in biomarker development for pre-symptomatic risk assessment or early stage diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "l-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is the most effective treatment for Parkinson's disease but can induce debilitating abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesia). Here we show that the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in the rat is accompanied by upregulation of an inflammatory cascade involving nitric oxide. Male Wistar rats sustained unilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle. After three weeks animals started to receive daily treatment with L-DOPA (30 mg/kg plus benserazide 7.5 mg/kg, for 21 days), combined with an inhibitor of neuronal NOS (7-nitroindazole, 7-NI, 30 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (saline-PEG 50%). All animals treated with L-DOPA and vehicle developed abnormal involuntary movements, and this effect was prevented by 7-NI. L-DOPA-treated dyskinetic animals exhibited an increased striatal and pallidal expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in reactive astrocytes, an increased number of CD11b-positive microglial cells with activated morphology, and the rise of cells positive for inducible nitric oxide-synthase immunoreactivity (iNOS). All these indexes of glial activation were prevented by 7-NI co-administration. These findings provide evidence that the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in the rat is associated with activation of glial cells that promote inflammatory responses. The dramatic effect of 7-NI in preventing this glial response points to an involvement of nitric oxide. Moreover, the results suggest that the NOS inhibitor prevents dyskinesia at least in part via inhibition of glial cell activation and iNOS expression. Our observations indicate nitric oxide synthase inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for preventing neuroinflammatory and glial components of dyskinesia pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are very common in neurodegenerative diseases and are a major contributor to disability and caregiver burden. There is accumulating evidence that NPS may be a prodrome and/or a \"risk factor\" of neurodegenerative diseases. The medications used to treat these symptoms in younger patients are not very effective in patients with neurodegenerative disease and may have serious side effects. An understanding of the neurobiology of NPS is critical for the development of more effective intervention strategies. Targeting these symptoms may also have implications for prevention of cognitive or motor decline. Molecular brain imaging represents a bridge between basic and clinical observations and provides many opportunities for translation from animal models and human post-mortem studies to in vivo human studies. Molecular brain imaging studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are reviewed with a primary focus on positron emission tomography studies of NPS. Future directions for the field of molecular imaging in AD and PD to understand the neurobiology of NPS will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "The neuroprotective effects of carnosic acid (CA), a phenolic diterpene isolated from rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), have been widely investigated in recent years, however, its protection in in vivo still unclear. In this study, we investigated the behavioral activity and neuroprotective effects of CA in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Rats were treated with 20mg/kg body weight of CA for 3 weeks before 6-OHDA exposure. Results indicated that CA improved the locomotor activity and reduced the apomorphine-caused rotation in 6-OHDA-stimulated rats. Significant protection against lipid peroxidation and GSH reduction was observed in the 6-OHDA rats pretreated with CA. Pretreatment with CA increased the protein expression of \u03b3-glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit, \u03b3-glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase compared with 6-OHDA-stimulated rats and SH-SY5Y cells. Immunoblots showed that the reduction of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, the induction of caspase 3 cleavage, and the induction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage by 6-OHDA was reversed in the presence of SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor) or SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) in SH-SY5Y cells. Rats treated with CA reversed the 6-OHDA-mediated the activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38, the down-regulation of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, the up-regulation of cleaved caspase 3/caspase 3 and cleaved PARP/PARP ratio, and the down-regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase protein. However, BAM7, an activator of Bax, attenuated the effect of CA on apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. These results suggest that CA protected against 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity is attributable to its anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative action. The present findings may help to clarify the possible mechanisms of rosemary in the neuroprotection of PD.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to rotenone leads to parkinsonian features, such as loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and motor impairment, however, the validity of this model has recently been questioned. In rodent and monkey models of Parkinson's disease (PD) abnormal neuronal activity in the basal ganglia motor loop has been described, with hyperactivity of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) similar to that found in PD. The present study aims at providing new and more specific evidence for the validity of the rotenone rat model of PD by examining whether neuronal activity in the STN is altered. Male Sprague Dawley rats were treated with rotenone injections (2.5mg/kg bodyweight intraperitoneally) for 60 days. Behavioral analysis showed an impairment in the rotarod and hanging wire test in the rotenone group (p<0.05), accompanied by a decline in tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons in the nigro-striatal region (p<0.001). Thereafter, single unit (SU) activities and local field potentials were recorded in the STN in urethane anesthetized rats. The SU analysis revealed a higher neuronal discharge rate (p<0.001), more bursts per minute (p=0.006) and a higher oscillatory activity (p=0.008) in the STN of rotenone treated rats. Spectral analysis showed an increase of relative beta power in the STN as well as in the motor cortex. We found electrophysiological key features of PD pathology and pathophysiology in the STN of rotenone treated rats. Therefore, the rotenone-induced rat model of PD deserves further attention since it covers more aspects than dopamine depletion and implies the reproducibility of PD specific features.",

    "abstract": "Rotenone is an environmental neurotoxin that induces accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), but the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. We investigated whether rotenone induced impairment of autophagic flux and lysosomal functions.\nAutophagy flux, accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein, lysosomal membrane integrity and neurodegeneration were assessed in the rotenone-treated rat model and PC12 cells, and the effects of the autophagy inducer trehalose on rotenone's cytotoxicity were also studied.\nRotenone administration significantly reduced motor activity and caused a loss of tyrosine hydroxylase in SNpc of Lewis rats. The degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons was accompanied by the deposition of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates, autophagosomes and redistribution of cathepsin D from lysosomes to the cytosol. In cultured PC12 cells, rotenone also induced increases in protein levels of \u03b1-synuclein, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II, Beclin 1, and p62. Rotenone increased lysosomal membrane permeability as evidenced by leakage of N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and cathepsin D, the effects were blocked by reactive oxygen species scavenger tiron. Autophagy inducer trehalose enhanced the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB, accelerated the clearance of autophagosomes and \u03b1-synuclein and attenuated rotenone-induced cell death of PC12 cells. Meanwhile, administration of trehalose to rats in drinking water (2%) decreased rotenone-induced dopaminergic neurons loss in SNpc.\nThese studies indicate that the lysosomal dysfunction contributes to rotenone's neurotoxicity and restoration of lysosomal function could be a new therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "SWEDDs (Scans Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficits) was defined from a series of pharmaceutical trials on Parkinson's disease (PD). Non-motor features including sleep-related problems are common even in early-stage PD patients; however, little is known about the burden of the non-motor symptoms in SWEDDs patients.\nThe Non-motor Symptoms Assessment Scale (NMSS), revised version of the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS-2), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) were applied to evaluate 17 SWEDDs patients and 28 de novo PD patients. The presence of clinically probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (cpRBD) was assessed using the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-Revised (ICSD-R) criteria.\nThe total NMSS score for the SWEDDs group was significantly lower than for the de novo PD group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.032). The most distinct difference was in taste or smell change (p\u00a0<\u00a00.000). Prevalence of cpRBD was higher in de novo PD patients than in SWEDDs patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.030), though no significant differences in the PDSS-2 total score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.496) or the ESS score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.517) were found. The SWEDDs patients did not significantly differ from the de novo PD patients with regard to quality of life, as measured by the EQ-5D index score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.177).\nThe patients with SWEDDs have less non-motor problems than newly diagnosed untreated PD patients. Given the difficulty distinguishing between SWEDDs and early PD, identifying some of non-motor symptoms, such as RBD or olfactory impairment, could aid clinicians in their work.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a major concern for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients because it is a leading cause of falls and is associated with poor quality of life. The pathophysiology is unknown but it is hypothesized that it relates to cognitive abnormalities; particularly executive and visuospatial dysfunction. However, prior results have been discrepant. Pharmacologic subtypes of FOG include those that are responsive and unresponsive to levodopa.\nTo determine whether executive and visuospatial dysfunction are associated specifically with the levodopa unresponsive subtype of FOG.\n135 PD subjects completed a single assessment included FOG questionnaire, UPDRS motor scale, comprehensive cognitive battery and measure of hallucinations. Analyses compared unresponsive (n\u00a0=\u00a016), responsive (n\u00a0=\u00a020) and no FOG (n\u00a0=\u00a099) subtypes.\nThe unresponsive subtype had a significantly older age of onset of PD than the responsive group (p\u00a0=\u00a0.03) and had worse motor scores (p\u00a0=\u00a0.003) than the no FOG group. Longer disease duration was associated with the responsive group compared to the no FOG group (p\u00a0=\u00a0.002). The unresponsive FOG group had significantly poorer visuospatial ability (p\u00a0=\u00a0.001) and executive functioning (p\u00a0=\u00a0.02) than both the no and responsive FOG subgroups. These latter groups were not significantly different. The responsive FOG group was associated with the presence of hallucinations.\nAside from pharmacological differences, unresponsive FOG is associated with executive and visuospatial dysfunction implicating frontostriatal pathways while responsive FOG is associated with hallucinations suggesting involvement of posterior cortical regions. Further study and treatment of FOG should include appropriate subtype classification.",

In this study, we firstly examined whether CGP42112, an AT2 receptor (AT2R) agonist, may exert direct protective effects on the rotenone-induced CATH.a cell injury in vitro. We used CATH.a cell line to evaluate changes in cultured dopaminergic neuron levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). We also evaluated expression of NADPH oxidase, AT1 and AT2 receptors in treated with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), rotenone, Ang II, AT2R agonist CGP42112, or AT2R antagonist PD123319, alone and combined (n=6, each group). Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot were used to determine messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of the AT1, AT2 receptors and NADPH oxidase. ROS generation was determined by the dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate fluorescent probe assay. The levels of SOD and GSH were measured by using available kits. In our study, CGP42112 (100nM) significantly reduced rotenone-induced oxidative stress and elevated the total SOD activity and GSH level. In addition, CGP42112 significantly increased AT2R expression and attenuated Ang II-induced NADPH oxidase activation, and these effects were completely abolished by the AT2R antagonist, PD123319 (1\u03bcM). Our results suggest that CGP42112 attenuates rotenone-induced oxidative stress in CATH.a neuron via activating AT2R and suppressing NADPH oxidase expression.",

    "abstract": "Neurogranin is a calmodulin binding protein that has been implicated in learning and memory, long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity. Neurons expressing neurogranin in the cortex degenerate in late stages of Parkinson's disease with widespread \u03b1-synuclein pathology. While analyzing neurogranin gene expression levels through rtPCR in brains of mouse models overexpressing human \u03b1-synuclein, we found levels were elevated 2.5 times when compared to nontransgenic animals. Immunohistochemistry in the cortex revealed colocalization between \u03b1-synuclein and neurogranin in mouse transgenics when compared to control mice. Coimmunoprecipitation studies in the superior temporal cortex in humans confirmed interaction between \u03b1-synuclein and neurogranin, and decreased interaction between \u03b1-synuclein and neurogranin was noticed in patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease when compared to normal control brains. Additionally, phosphorylated neurogranin levels were also decreased in the human superior temporal cortex in patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and patients diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies. Here, we show for the first time that neurogranin binds to \u03b1-synuclein in the human cortex, and this interaction decreases in Parkinson's disease along with the phosphorylation of neurogranin, a molecular process thought to be involved in learning and memory.",

    "abstract": "Chronic treatment with levodopa or antipsychotics results in manifestation of side-effects such as dyskinesia which correlates with changes in expression and function of receptors and signaling proteins. Previous studies have suggested a role for the dopamine D3 receptor in Parkinson's disease (PD) and tardive dyskinesia. Yet the expression and signaling function of D3 receptor in these disorders is not well understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that chronic levodopa treatment alters both expression and function of D3 receptors in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine plus probenecid (MPTP/p) mouse model of PD. drd3-EGFP reporter mice were injected biweekly with saline or MPTP and probenecid for a 5-week period. During the last two weeks of the 5-week period, the mice were administered saline or levodopa twice daily. Locomotor activity was measured during the treatment period. D3 receptor expression was determined by western blot analysis. D3 receptor signaling function was determined at tissue and single cell level by measuring the activation of D3 receptor-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The drd3-EGFP mice administered MPTP/p exhibited akinesia/bradykinesia. Expression of D3 receptor protein in the dorsal striatum specifically increased in the MPTP/p-treated mice administered levodopa. In the dorsal striatum of levodopa and MPTP/p-treated drd3-EGFP mice, administration of a D3 receptor-selective dose of agonist, PD128907, failed to activate D3 receptor-MAPK signaling. These results suggest that MPTP-induced lesion and chronic levodopa treatment alters D3 receptor expression and function in the dorsal striatum which could contribute to the development of dyskinesias and other motor side-effects.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to identify the contribution of additional noradrenergic depletion to forelimb akinesia and abnormal subthalamic nucleus (STN) firing activity in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nForelimb akinesia behaviors were tested in awake rats with noradrenergic N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) lesions, unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and with combined 6-OHDA and DSP-4 lesions. STN extracellular single-unit and local field potential (LFP) activities were examined in the animals that were anesthetized with urethane.\nThe adjusting steps and the contralateral touches of rats in the forelimb akinesia behavior tests were markedly inhibited by a further noradrenergic lesion with DSP-4 in 6-OHDA+DSP-4-lesioned group when compared with those of 6-OHDA-lesioned animals (P<0.05 for all comparisons). Meanwhile, the neuronal firing pattern of STN also changed significantly towards more bursty in 6-OHDA + DSP-4-lesioned group (P <0 .05). Compared with 6-OHDA-lesioned animals, an additional noradrenergic lesion increased the 0.3-2.5 Hz oscillatory activity and the spike power of STN neurons (P < 0.01 for both comparisons), and strengthened the synchronized oscillation between subthalamic neuronal firing and LFP activity in 6-OHDA + DSP-4-lesioned group (P < 0.01).\nThe results provide evidence to support the correlation between noradrenergic depletion and the further exaggerated dysfunction of STN electrical activity in PD and suggest that an aberrant noradrenergic system might play a specific role in the motor deficits of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key protein in brain plasticity and is particularly important for survival of dopaminergic neurons. The Val66Met polymorphism of BDNF (rs6265) has been associated with functional differences (mainly cognitive) between healthy adults and also with differences in the clinical expression of several other neuropsychiatric illnesses including PD. However, these studies used different outcome measures, have not been replicated, and were cross sectional, making it difficult to establish the role of BDNF in the clinical variability of PD. Here, a large cohort of 384 PD patients were followed up for 2 years, and associations between BDNF genotype and various clinical characteristics were examined. The BDNF Met-allele carriers showed a significantly smaller decline in set shifting during follow-up compared with the homozygous BDNF Val-allele carriers. Contrary to previous assumptions, these results indicate that mental flexibility is one of the cognitive processes that may benefit from the BDNF Met allele in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "In two 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, rotigotine transdermal system was well-tolerated and efficacious monotherapy in early-stage PD. This post hoc analysis of the long-term open-label extensions (NCT00594165; NCT00599196) of these studies assessed incidence and severity of dyskinesia in participants treated with rotigotine, with or without concomitant levodopa, for up to 6 years.\nOpen-label rotigotine was titrated to optimal dose (\u226416\u00a0mg/24\u00a0h). Concomitant levodopa was permitted. Dyskinesia data, recorded using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part IV, were pooled from the two open-label studies.\nOf 596 participants who received open-label rotigotine, 299 (50%) remained at trial closure; no patient discontinued due to dyskinesia. In the two studies, median exposure to rotigotine was 1910 days (\u223c5 years, 3 months), and 1564.5 days (\u223c4 years, 3 months). During up to 6 years of open-label rotigotine, 423/596 (71%) received levodopa. Dyskinesias were reported in 115/596 (19%) participants, 90/115 (78%) of who developed dyskinesia after levodopa was added; 25 reported dyskinesia in the absence of levodopa (includes patients who never received open-label levodopa, and those who reported dyskinesia before starting concomitant levodopa). Dyskinesia severity data were available for 107 of the 115 participants. In 56/107 (52%) participants, dyskinesia was considered 'not disabling' for all occurrences; the worst-case severity was 'mildly disabling' for 33/107 (31%), and 'moderately' or 'severely disabling' for 18/107 (17%; 3% of total participants).\nDuring treatment with rotigotine in patients with PD for up to 6 years the incidence of dyskinesia was low, and the dyskinesia was generally 'not disabling' or 'mildly disabling'.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of both parkinsonian signs and Parkinson's disease (PD) per se increases with age. Although the pathophysiology of PD has been studied extensively, less is known about the functional changes taking place in the basal ganglia circuitry with age. To specifically address this issue, 3 groups of rhesus macaques were studied: normal middle-aged animals (used as controls), middle-aged animals with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism, and aged animals (>20 years old) with declines in motor function. All animals underwent the same behavioral and pharmacologic magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) procedures to measure changes in basal ganglia function in response to dopaminergic drug challenges consisting of apomorphine administration followed by either a D1 (SCH23390) or a D2 (raclopride) receptor antagonist. Significant functional changes were predominantly seen in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) in aged animals and in the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) in MPTP-lesioned animals. Despite significant differences seen in the putamen and GPe between MPTP-lesioned versus aged animals, a similar response profile to dopaminergic stimulations was found between these 2 groups in the internal segment of the GP. In contrast, the pharmacologic responses seen in the control animals were much milder compared with the other 2 groups in all the examined areas. Our phMRI findings in MPTP-lesioned parkinsonian and aged animals suggest that changes in basal ganglia function in the elderly may differ from those seen in parkinsonian patients and that phMRI could be used to distinguish PD from other age-associated functional alterations in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Verifying the validity and feasibility of the WOQ-19 as a useful tool in routine clinical practice and in management of patients.\n532 consecutive Parkinson's disease (PD) patients were recruited from 6 different neurological outpatient units, specialized in movement disorders, of central Italy. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of PD and any current pharmacological treatment of PD while exclusion criteria were evident cognitive or depressive impairment, infusion with dopamine agonists or Duodopa, or Deep Brain Stimulation therapy. Patients were asked to complete the Italian version of WOQ-19 before the neurological visit. A medical form for the collection of demographic and clinical data of patients and for the evaluation of comprehensibility and usability the WOQ-19 was filled by the neurologist during the visit.\nOur data confirmed that WOQ-19 was able to identify WO in 69% of patients, a percentage similar to the recently reported in the Italian WOQ-19 validation study. Motor symptoms were more frequent than non-motor symptoms (80% vs. 20%). Patients who experienced WO had a higher age of PD onset, more severe disease, longer disease duration and were more likely to be female.\nThe WOQ-19 was understandable for the patient, easily administered and suitable for routine outpatient use. It could be also particularly useful in clinical practice in the early identification of non-motor symptoms, often under reported by patients and revealed only with clinical support.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disturbances and cognitive impairment are common non-motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent studies suggest that sleep spindles and slow waves play a role in brain plasticity mechanisms and are associated with cognitive performance. However, it remains unknown whether these sleep parameters could serve as markers of cognitive decline in PD. Therefore, we examined whether alterations in sleep spindles and slow waves at baseline visit were associated with increased likelihood of developing dementia at follow-up in PD. Sixty-eight nondemented PD patients (64.9 \u00b1 8.8 years old; 46 men) participated in the study, along with 47 healthy individuals (65.0 \u00b1 10.6 years old; 30 men). All participants underwent baseline polysomnographic recording and a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Sleep spindles (12-15 Hz) and slow waves (>75 \u03bcV and <4 Hz) were automatically detected on all-night non-rapid eye movement sleep electroencephalography. At follow-up (mean: 4.5 years later), 18 PD patients developed dementia (70.2 \u00b1 7.6 years old; 13 men) and 50 remained dementia-free (63.0 \u00b1 8.5 years old; 33 men). Sleep spindle density and amplitude were lower in PD patients who converted to dementia compared with both patients who remained dementia-free and controls, mostly in posterior cortical regions (p < 0.05). Dementia-free PD patients were intermediate between dementia patients and controls, with lower baseline sleep spindle density in all cortical areas compared with controls (p < 0.01). In demented PD patients, lower sleep spindle amplitude in parietal and occipital areas was associated with poorer visuospatial abilities. Although slow wave amplitude was lower in PD patients compared with controls (p < 0.0001), no difference was observed between those who developed or did not develop dementia. Results demonstrate non-rapid eye movement sleep electroencephalographic abnormalities in PD patients. Sleep spindle activity was particularly impaired in PD patients who developed dementia, with a more posterior topographic pattern. Sleep spindle alterations are associated with later development of dementia in PD, and thus may serve as an additional marker of cognitive decline in these patients.",

    "abstract": "High frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) has been shown to have little impact on postural control and gait improvements in Parkinson's disease (PD). There is a lack of consensus and quantitative evidence to suggest that stimulating STN at a lower frequency (LFS) as compared to HFS will be superior in improving symptoms.\nTo determine if postural control and gait characteristics of persons with PD improve at an LFS (60\u00a0Hz) compared to HFS (>100\u00a0Hz). We hypothesized that persons with PD would perform better on postural control and gait measures at LFS.\nNineteen participants with bilateral STN-DBS underwent UPDRS, static and dynamic postural control using gait initiation, and gait evaluations in three stimulation conditions (baseline voltage stable across conditions: OFF, LFS of 60\u00a0Hz, and HFS of >100\u00a0Hz). Additionally 10/19 participants were also stimulated at 30\u00a0Hz and 60\u00a0Hz and at higher voltages. A one-way ANOVA was performed to compare the conditions.\nTotal UPDRS-III score, step length and velocity during gait initiation, and gait speed significantly improved during 60\u00a0Hz and >100\u00a0Hz conditions when compared to the OFF condition (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There were no significant differences between 60\u00a0Hz and >100\u00a0Hz conditions. Using LFS at higher voltage showed no improvement over >100\u00a0Hz condition.\nThe positive effects of both LFS and HFS on postural control and gait were similar and clinical changes were relatively small. LFS may not help improve postural control, and gait particularly for persons with PD who do not develop gait-related disorders after HFS.",

    "abstract": "Sex and blood level of sex hormones play a key role not only in the susceptibility to develop Parkinson's disease (PD) but also influence the natural course of the disease. The aim of this study was to compare reproductive lifespan events in females affected with PD and in \"non-parkinsonian\" age matched subjects and to evaluate whether the whole life endogenous oestrogen level is associated with variables describing the course of the disease.\nReproductive lifespan, age at menarche, age at menopause, gynaecological interventions and parity were compared in 76 women with idiopathic PD and in the age-adjusted control group of 74 subjects. Affected women underwent neurological and psychological assessment. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney U Test and Spearman Rank Correlation Test.\nWomen affected with PD had a shorter reproductive lifespan and experienced final menstruation earlier than the control group. Early menopause was reported by 24% of the patients and only by 16% of the control subjects. Parkinsonian women reported more commonly the history of surgical menopause. Duration of reproductive lifespan, age at menopause and the type of menopause influenced both motor and cognitive functioning of patients.\nThere may be a relationship between the lifetime average endogenous oestrogen level and the susceptibility to develop PD. Longer reproductive lifespan resulting in higher \"whole life\" female sex steroids concentrations may exert a protective effect on central nervous system, resulting in milder course of the disease.",

    "abstract": "The effect of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is not well known. We evaluated the change in the incidence of probable RBD after bilateral STN DBS in PD patients. Ninety patients with PD treated with bilateral STN DBS underwent retrospective assessment of RBD by interview before and after DBS. Forty-seven (52.2%) of the 90 patients had RBD preoperatively. RBD was resolved only in one patient and persisted in 46 patients at 1 year after DBS. RBD developed de novo in 16 patients (de novo RBD group) within 1 year after DBS, resulting in 62 (68.9%) of the 90 patients having RBD 1 year after DBS. Patients with RBD at any time within 1 year after DBS (RBD group, n = 63) were older than the patients without RBD (non-RBD group, n = 27). The sum of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) axial score for the \"on\" state was lower in the RBD group than in the non-RBD group after DBS (p = 0.029). Comparing the de novo RBD group and non-RBD group, the UPDRS Part III and total score and the levodopa equivalent daily doses for the \"on\" states decreased more in the de novo RBD group than in the non-RBD group (p < 0.05). The incidence of clinical RBD increased after bilateral STN DBS because de novo RBD developed and pre-existing RBD persisted after DBS.",

    "abstract": "[Purpose] The aim of this study was to clarify the effects of guidance in home exercise on physical function and the amount of activity in home care patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). [Subjects and Methods] A 2-month home exercise intervention consisting of self-administered exercise by patients (self-exercise) and home visit exercise therapy guided by a physical therapist (home visit exercise) was conducted in 10 home care patients with PD to compare changes in physical function, activities of daily living, and postural status between before and after the intervention. [Results] A decreased number of chief complaints and alleviation of fear of falling were observed after the intervention. In terms of physical function, a significant increase in flexibility and muscle strength were observed, although no significant changes were found in activities of daily living, gait, and balance. Although there was no significant change in the total amount of daily physical activity, the analysis of daily posture changes revealed a significant reduction in the percentage of time spent lying down and a significant increase in the percentage of time spent sitting after the intervention. [Conclusion] Guidance in home exercise in home care patients with PD can be effective in making self-exercise a habit, improving range of motion and muscle strength, and reducing the time spent in a supine position.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease has an insidious onset and is diagnosed when typical motor features occur. Several motor and non-motor features can occur before diagnosis, early in the disease process. We aimed to assess the association between first presentation of several prediagnostic features in primary care and a subsequent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, and to chart the timeline of these first presentations before diagnosis.\nWe identified individuals with a first diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and those without Parkinson's disease from Jan 1, 1996, to Dec 31, 2012, from The Health Improvement Network UK primary care database. Codes were extracted for a range of possible prediagnostic or early symptoms, comprising motor features (tremor, rigidity, balance impairments, neck pain or stiffness, and shoulder pain or stiffness), autonomic features (constipation, hypotension, erectile dysfunction, urinary dysfunction, and dizziness), neuropsychiatric disturbances (memory problems, late-onset anxiety or depression, cognitive decline, and apathy), and additional features (fatigue, insomnia, anosmia, hypersalivation and rapid-eye-movement sleep behaviour disorder) in the years before diagnosis. We report the incidence of symptoms recorded in more than 1% of cases per 1000 person-years and incidence risk ratios (RRs) for individuals with and without Parkinson's disease at 2, 5, and 10 years before diagnosis.\n8166 individuals with and 46,755 individuals without Parkinson's disease were included in the study. Apathy, REM sleep behaviour disorder, anosmia, hypersalivation, and cognitive decline were all reported in less than 1% of people per 1000 person-years and were excluded from further analyses. At 2 years before Parkinson's disease diagnosis, the incidence of all studied prediagnostic features except neck pain or stiffness was higher in patients who went on to develop Parkinson's disease (n=7232) than in controls (n=40,541). At 5 years before diagnosis, compared with controls (n=25,544), patients who went on to develop Parkinson's disease (n=4769) had a higher incidence of tremor (RR 13\u00b770, 95% CI 7\u00b782-24\u00b731), balance impairments (2\u00b719, 1\u00b709-4\u00b716), constipation (2\u00b724, 2\u00b704-2\u00b746), hypotension (3\u00b723, 1\u00b785-5\u00b752), erectile dysfunction (1\u00b730, 1\u00b711-1\u00b751), urinary dysfunction (1\u00b796, 1\u00b734-2\u00b780), dizziness (1\u00b799, 1\u00b767-2\u00b737), fatigue (1\u00b756, 1\u00b727-1\u00b791), depression (1\u00b776, 1\u00b741-2\u00b717), and anxiety (1\u00b741, 1\u00b709-1\u00b779). At 10 years before diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, the incidence of tremor (RR 7\u00b759, 95% CI 1\u00b711-44\u00b783) and constipation (2\u00b701, 1\u00b762-2\u00b749) was higher in those who went on to develop Parkinson's disease (n=1680) than in controls (n=8305).\nA range of prediagnostic features can be detected several years before diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in primary care. These data can be incorporated into ongoing efforts to identify individuals at the earliest stages of the disease for inclusion in future trials and to help understand progression in the earliest phase of Parkinson's disease.\nParkinson's UK.",

    "abstract": "Prefrontal cortex plays a vital role in the theory of mind (ToM) and decision making, as shown in functional brain imaging and lesion studies. Considering the primary neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) involving the frontal lobe system, patients with PD are expected to exhibit deficits in ToM and social decision making. The aim of this study was to investigate affective ToM and decision making in patients with PD and healthy controls (HC) in a task assessing affective ToM (Reading the Mind in the Eyes, RME) and two decision-making tasks (Iowa Gambling Task, IGT; Game of Dice Task, GDT). Consistent with previous findings, patients with PD were impaired in the affective ToM task, and when making decisions under ambiguity and in risk situations. The score of emotion recognition in the RME task was negatively correlated with the severity of the disease and positively correlated with the total number of advantageous cards chosen in the IGT. However, the final capital in the GDT was correlated with memory impairment. The present study implies that affective ToM and decision making under ambiguity may share similar neural mechanisms, while decision making under ambiguity and decision making under risk may involve processing within different neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Despite of previous evidence supporting the association between impulse control disorder (ICD) and several demographic, clinical and therapeutic features in Parkinson's disease (PD), the relationships between pathological gambling (PG) or other variants of ICD (ICD-NOS) and specific neuropsychiatric or cognitive domains are not entirely defined. In this study, 155 PD patients without dementia or cognitive impairment underwent: i. the ICD diagnoses, using the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders, ii. the mood and anxiety disorders diagnoses, according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria, and iii. a comprehensive battery for measuring severity of psychopathology and neuropsychology domains. Patients were divided in those with pathological gambling (PG), ICDs not otherwise specified (ICD-NOS), or the lack of ICD (No-ICD). There was a progression in age and age at onset from the younger PG subjects throughout ICD-NOS to No-ICD. PG and ICD-NOS subjects had longer disease duration and were taking significantly higher dosages of antiparkinsonian drugs than No-ICD ones. PG subjects had significantly higher severity of depressive and anxious symptoms with respect to the other 2 groups. Both PG and ICD-NOS subjects suffer from increased severity of psychotic symptoms than No-ICD ones. The 3 groups did not differ in any cognitive measure. Our results support the concept that the different sociodemographic and neuropsychiatric profiles of PD patients are associated with different ICDs. Moreover, we clearly demonstrate the lack of relationship between ICD and cognitive performances in undemented PD patients.",

Participants in New York (n = 112) were evaluated with the entire battery. Tel Aviv participants (n = 124) were evaluated on attention, executive function and psychomotor speed tasks. The association between G2019S mutation status (predictor) and each neuropsychological test (outcome) was assessed using linear regression models adjusted for PIGD motor phenotype, site, sex, age, disease duration, education, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III, levodopa equivalent dose, and Geriatric Depression Score (GDS).\nCarriers had longer disease duration (p < 0.001) and were more likely to manifest the PIGD phenotype (p = 0.024). In adjusted regression models, carriers performed better than non-carriers in Stroop Word Reading (p < 0.001), Stroop Interference (p = 0.011) and Category Fluency (p = 0.026).\nIn AJ-PD, G2019S mutation status is associated with better attention (Stroop Word Reading), executive function (Stroop Interference) and language (Category Fluency) after adjustment for PIGD motor phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is an early and common symptom in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). Recently, the relation between olfactory dysfunction and cognitive loss in IPD has been reported. In our study, we aimed to investigate the relation between olfactory dysfunction and cognitive impairments in early IPD related with this theory.\nIn this study, we included 28 patients with stage 1 and stage 2 IPD according to the Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) scale and 19 healthy participants. The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) was performed for evaluating olfactory function. For cognitive investigation in participants, the clock drawing test, Stroop test, verbal fluency test, Benton face recognition test (BFR), Benton line judgment orientation test (BLO), and Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) were performed.\nWe found significantly lower UPSIT scores in the patient group compared to controls (p=.018). In the neuropsychological investigation, only Stroop test and BLOT test scores were significantly lower in the patient group compared to controls (p=.003, p=.002, respectively). We found a negative correlation between UPSIT scores and Stroop time (p=.033) and Stroop error (p=.037) and a positive correlation between UPSIT scores and SBST long-term memory scores (p=.016) in patients.\nIn our study, we found mild cognitive impairment related with visuospatial and executive functions in early-stage IPD compared to controls. But, in the patient group, we detected a different impairment pattern of memory and frontal functions that correlated with hyposmia. This different pattern might be indicating a subgroup of IPD characterized by low performance in episodic verbal memory, with accompanying olfactory dysfunction in the early stage.",

    "abstract": "Advances in understanding the etiology of Parkinson disease have been driven by the identification of causative mutations in families. Genetic analysis of an Australian family with three males displaying clinical features of early-onset parkinsonism and intellectual disability identified a \u223c45 kb deletion resulting in the complete loss of RAB39B. We subsequently identified a missense mutation (c.503C>A [p.Thr168Lys]) in RAB39B in an unrelated Wisconsin kindred affected by a similar clinical phenotype. In silico and in\u00a0vitro studies demonstrated that the mutation destabilized the protein, consistent with loss of function. In\u00a0vitro small-hairpin-RNA-mediated knockdown of Rab39b resulted in a reduction in the density of \u03b1-synuclein immunoreactive puncta in dendritic processes of cultured neurons. In addition, in multiple cell models, we demonstrated that knockdown of Rab39b was associated with reduced steady-state levels of \u03b1-synuclein. Post mortem studies demonstrated that loss of RAB39B resulted in pathologically confirmed Parkinson disease. There was extensive dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra and widespread classic Lewy body pathology. Additional pathological features included cortical Lewy bodies, brain iron accumulation, tau immunoreactivity, and axonal spheroids. Overall, we have shown that loss-of-function mutations in RAB39B cause intellectual disability and pathologically confirmed early-onset Parkinson disease. The loss of RAB39B results in dysregulation of \u03b1-synuclein homeostasis and a spectrum of neuropathological features that implicate RAB39B in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease and potentially other neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by motor symptoms and signs, and non-motor abnormalities such as olfactory dysfunction, pain, sleep disorders and cognitive impairment. Amongst these alterations, sleep disturbances play an important role in the pathology, but presence of disturbed sleep is not currently considered in diagnosis. However, sleeping problems may precede by many years the classic motor abnormalities of PD and should be clinically evaluated as a potential marker before disease onset. The first disturbance reported with this potential was the disorder REM sleep behaviour and currently several other disturbances have gained importance as potential markers, such as excessive daytime sleepiness, restless legs syndrome and new evidence also points to changes in circadian rhythms. Here we present a brief review of the major evidence indicating that sleep disturbances precede the motor symptoms in PD and neurodegeneration occurs in regions that could underlie these phenomena in order to provide support for the conclusion that disturbances of sleep should be considered as valuable preclinical markers for PD.",

    "abstract": "Interest in improving care for the growing number of individuals with chronic conditions is rising. However, access to care is limited by distance, disability, and distribution of doctors. Small-scale studies in Parkinson disease, a prototypical chronic condition, have suggested that delivering care using video house calls is feasible, offers similar clinical outcomes to in-person care, and reduces travel burden.\nWe are conducting a randomized comparative effectiveness study (Connect.Parkinson) comparing usual care in the community to usual care augmented by virtual house calls with a Parkinson disease specialist. Recruitment is completed centrally using online advertisements and emails and by contacting physicians, support groups, and allied health professionals. Efforts target areas with a high proportion of individuals not receiving care from neurologists. Approximately 200 individuals with Parkinson disease and their care partners will be enrolled at 20 centers throughout the United States and followed for one year. Participants receive educational materials, then are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to continue their usual care (control arm) or usual care and specialty care delivered virtually (intervention arm). Care partners are surveyed about their time and travel burden and their perceived caregiver burden. Participants are evaluated via electronic survey forms and videoconferencing with a blinded independent rater at baseline and at 12 months. All study activities are completed remotely.The primary outcomes are: (1) feasibility, as measured by the proportion of visits completed, and (2) quality of life, as measured by the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include measures of clinical benefit, quality of care, time and travel burden, and caregiver burden.\nConnect.Parkinson will evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of using technology to deliver care into the homes of individuals with Parkinson disease. The trial may serve as a model for increasing access and delivering patient-centered care at home for individuals with chronic conditions.\nThis trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov on January 8, 2014 [NCT02038959].",

    "abstract": "The circadian system in suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) involves regulated serotonin levels and coordinated expression of various clock genes. To understand circadian disfunction in the age-related neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson's disease (PD), the rotenone-induced PD (RIPD) male Wistar rat model was used. The alterations in the rhythmic dynamic equilibrium of interactions between the various components of serotonin metabolism and the molecular clock were measured. There was significant decrease in the mean 24 h levels of tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), serotonin (5-HT), N-acetyl serotonin (NAS) and melatonin (MEL) by approximately 63, 51, 76 and 96% respectively ( p \u2264 0.05). However significant increase in 5-methoxy indole acetic acid (5-MIAA), 5-methoxy tryptophol (5-MTOH), 5-hydroxy tryptophol (5-HTOH) indicated increased serotonin catabolism with the abolition of daily rhythms of MEL, 5-HTP and 5-MIAA in RIPD. 24 h mean levels of rPer1, rCry1, rBmal1 reduced by about 0.5, 0.74 and 0.39-fold and increased for rPer2 by about 1.7-fold. The daily pulse of rPer2, rCry1, rCry2 and rBmal1 significantly decreased by 0.36, 0.6, 0.14, 0.1 and 0.2-fold. As melatonin, an antioxidant and an endogenous synchronizer of rhythm declined in RIPD male Wistar rat model, the effects of melatonin-administration on the rhythmic expression of various clock genes were studied. Interestingly, melatonin-administration resulted in restoration of the phase of rPer1 daily rhythm in RIPD indicating differential sensitivity of various clock components towards melatonin. The animals which were administered both rotenone and MEL for 48 days interestingly showed neuroprotective effects in dark phase on correlations between expression of various genes.",

    "abstract": "Motor thalamus (Mthal) is a key node in the corticobasal ganglia (BG) loop that controls complex, cognitive aspects of movement. In Parkinson's disease (PD), profound alterations in neuronal activity occur in BG nuclei and cortex. Because Mthal is located between these two structures, altered Mthal activity has been assumed to underlie the pathogenesis of PD motor deficits. However, to date, inconsistent changes in neuronal firing rate and pattern have been reported in parkinsonian animals. Moreover, although a distinct firing pattern of Mthal neurons, called low-threshold calcium spike bursts (LTS bursts), is observed in reduced preparations, it remains unknown whether they occur or what their role might be in behaving animals. We recorded Mthal spiking activity in control and unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats performing a skilled forelimb-reaching task. We show for the first time that Mthal firing rate in control rats is modulated in a temporally precise pattern during reach-to-grasp movements, with a peak at the time of the reach-end and troughs just before and after it. We identified LTS-like events on the basis of LTS burst characteristics. These were rare, but also modulated, decreasing in incidence just after reach-end. The inhibitory modulations in firing rate and LTS-like events were abolished in parkinsonian rats. These data confirm that nigrostriatal dopamine depletion is accompanied by profound and specific deficits in movement-related Mthal activity. These changes would severely impair Mthal contributions to motor program development in motor cortex and are likely to be an important factor underlying the movement deficits of PD.",

    "abstract": "Paraquat (PQ) exposure causes degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in an exposed organism while altered metabolism has a role in various neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, the study presented here was conceived to depict the role of altered metabolism in PQ-induced Parkinson-like symptoms and to explore Drosophila as a potential model organism for such studies. Metabolic profile was generated in control and in flies that were fed PQ (5, 10, and 20 mM) in the diet for 12 and 24 h concurrent with assessment of indices of oxidative stress, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and behavioral alteration. PQ was found to significantly alter 24 metabolites belonging to different biological pathways along with significant alterations in the above indices. In addition, PQ attenuated brain dopamine content in the exposed organism. The study demonstrates that PQ-induced alteration in the metabolites leads to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration in the exposed organism along with movement disorder, a phenotype typical of Parkinson-like symptoms. The study is relevant in the context of Drosophila and humans because similar alteration in the metabolic pathways has been observed in both PQ-exposed Drosophila and in postmortem samples of patients with Parkinsonism. Furthermore, this study provides advocacy towards the applicability of Drosophila as an alternate model organism for pre-screening of environmental chemicals for their neurodegenerative potential with altered metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is common in PD, even in early stages. The construct of mild cognitive impairment has been used to identify clinically evident cognitive impairment without functional decline in PD patients (PD-MCI). The aim of the present study was to investigate brain connectivity associated with PD-MCI through RS-fMRI. RS-fMRI at 3T was collected in 42 PD patients and 20 matched healthy controls. Among PD patients, 21 were classified as having MCI (PD-MCI) and 21 as cognitively unimpaired (PD-nMCI) based on criteria for possible PD-MCI (level I category). Single-subject and group-level ICA was used to investigate the integrity of brain networks related to cognition in PD patients with and without MCI. Image data processing and statistical analysis were performed in BrainVoyager QX. In addition, we used VBM to test whether functional connectivity differences were related to structural abnormalities. PD-nMCI and PD-MCI patients compared with controls showed decreased DMN connectivity. PD-MCI patients, but not PD-nMCI, compared with controls, showed decreased functional connectivity of bilateral prefrontal cortex within the frontoparietal network. The decreased prefrontal cortex connectivity correlated with cognitive parameters but not with clinical variables. VBM analysis did not reveal any difference in local gray matter between patients and controls. Our findings suggest that an altered DMN connectivity characterizes PD patients, regardless of cognitive status, whereas a functional disconnection of the frontoparietal network could be associated with MCI in PD in the absence of detectable structural changes.",

    "abstract": "To observe the clinical curative effect of Chinese medicine Bushen Huoxue Granule(\u8865\u80be\u6d3b\u8840\u9897\u7c92, BHG) on Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with depressive state.\nSixty-two PD patients with depressive state were randomly assigned to two groups by using a random number table, 31 in each group. Madopar was given to all as the conventional treatment. The fluoxetine hydrochloride dispersible tablet was given to the patients in the control group and BHG was given to those in the treatment group. The therapeutic course for all was 12 weeks. Before and after treatment, Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD) was applied to judge the curative effect, and the changes of cerebral neurotransmitters levels in the brain of patients were detected by encephalofluctuograph technique.\nThe scores of HAMD in the two groups were decreased markedly after 12-week treatment. It was lower in the treatment group than that in the control group with significant difference (P<0.01). The contents of norepinephrine (NE) and 5-serotonin (5-HT) in the PD patients were obviously lower than normal value. There was no significant difference between the two groups before treatment (P>0.05). The contents of NE and 5-HT were all increased in the two groups after treatment (P<0.05), with significant differences between the two groups (P<0.01).\nBHG could increase the contents of NE and 5-HT in PD patients' brain to improve the depressive state of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a chronically developing neurodegenerative disease showing typical motor symptoms of the following triad: resting tremor, freezing of gait, and bradykinesia-hypokinesia. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a communal exercise program, using the visual and auditory feedback provided by a smart application, to assess gait ability, fear of falling, and fall efficacy in Parkinson's disease patients. Subjects consisted of 29 Parkinson's disease patients who were non-demented individuals. The subjects were randomly divided into three groups: the control group (n= 9, CG), the communal exercise group using the smart application (n= 10, CCEG), and the individual exercise group using the smart application (n= 10, ICEG). The communal exercise program consisted of a warm up (10 min) followed by communal exercise using the smart application (40 min), and a cool down (10 min) for 3 days per week over 10 weeks. The results presented here show that velocity and cadence were significantly increased among groups. Step and stride length were significantly increased among times. Fear of falling and fall efficacy were significantly different among groups and times. In particular, fear of falling was lower and fall efficacy was higher in the CCEG than in the ICEG and CG. These findings indicate that 10 weeks of the communal exercise program using the smart application can be effective in improving gait ability, fear of falling, and fall efficacy in Parkinson's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier supplies brain tissues with nutrients and filters certain compounds from the brain back to the bloodstream. In several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), there are disruptions of the blood-brain barrier. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been widely investigated in PD and in other parkinsonian syndromes with the aim of establishing useful biomarkers for an accurate differential diagnosis among these syndromes. This review article summarizes the studies reported on CSF levels of many potential biomarkers of PD. The most consistent findings are: (a) the possible role of CSF urate on the progression of the disease; (b) the possible relations of CSF total tau and phosphotau protein with the progression of PD and with the preservation of cognitive function in PD patients; (c) the possible value of CSF beta-amyloid 1-42 as a useful marker of further cognitive decline in PD patients, and (d) the potential usefulness of CSF neurofilament (NFL) protein levels in the differential diagnosis between PD and other parkinsonian syndromes. Future multicentric, longitudinal, prospective studies with long-term follow-up and neuropathological confirmation would be useful in establishing appropriate biomarkers for PD.",

    "abstract": "The pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons, leading to depletion of striatal dopamine. Recent neuroanatomical work has identified pathways for communication across striatal subdivisions, suggesting that the striatum provides a platform for integration of information across parallel corticostriatal circuits. The aim of this study was to investigate whether dopaminergic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease was associated with impairments in functional connectivity across striatal subdivisions, which could potentially reflect reduced integration across corticostriatal circuits. Utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we analyzed functional connectivity in 39 patients with Parkinson's disease, both \"on\" and \"off\" their regular dopaminergic medications, along with 40 age-matched healthy controls. Our results demonstrate widespread impairments in connectivity across subdivisions of the striatum in patients with Parkinson's disease in the \"off\" state. The administration of dopaminergic medication significantly improved connectivity across striatal subdivisions in Parkinson's disease, implicating dopaminergic deficits in the pathogenesis of impaired striatal interconnectivity. In addition, impaired striatal interconnectivity in the Parkinson's disease \"off\" state was associated with pathological decoupling of the striatum from the thalamic and sensorimotor (SM) networks. Specifically, we found that although the strength of striatal interconnectivity was positively correlated with both (i) the strength of internal thalamic connectivity, and (ii) the strength of internal SM connectivity, in both healthy controls and the Parkinson's disease \"on\" state, these relationships were absent in Parkinson's disease when in the \"off\" state. Taken together our findings emphasize the central role of dopamine in integrated striatal function and the pathological consequences of striatal dopamine denervation in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Tremor is one of the cardinal features of Parkinson disease (PD) and may cause cumulative trauma-related injury to nerves of the hands. The aim of this study was to assess the electrodiagnostic and sonographic features of patients with PD and to assess the effect of tremor in PD on the median nerve.\nWe studied 31 hands of healthy control participants (n = 16; mean age \u00b1 SD, 60.25 \u00b1 14.67 years) and 81 hands of patients with PD (n = 42; 64.95 \u00b1 11.13 years). Motor symptoms were measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III. Median nerve conduction studies and sonographic cross-sectional area measurements were performed in all participants.\nThe median nerve cross-sectional area in patients with PD (10.71 \u00b1 2.79 mm(2)) was significantly larger than that in the control group (7.40 \u00b1 1.05 mm(2); P < .05). However, there was no significant difference in median nerve electrodiagnostic findings between the PD and control groups. The median nerve cross-sectional area was associated with the severity of the tremor but not with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score.\nTremor in PD is associated with median nerve enlargement but not with impairment of median nerve conduction.",

Cutoff values for the substantia nigra echogenic area, defining substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, vary among ultrasound systems from different manufacturers. In this study we wanted to determine the cutoff criterion for a Toshiba (Tokyo, Japan) system and to assess its diagnostic value.\nThree hundred participants (controls, n = 138; patients with PD, n = 105; and patients with essential tremor, n = 57) underwent transcranial sonography following a standardized protocol.\nThe substantia nigra was assessable in 92.7% of all participants. The substantia nigra echogenic area (larger of bilateral measurements) was larger in patients with PD (mean \u00b1 SD, 0.24 \u00b1 0.05 cm(2)) than controls (0.14 \u00b1 0.05 cm(2); P < .001) and patients with essential tremor (0.14 \u00b1 0.04 cm(2); P < .001). Substantia nigra echogenicity was larger in male participants (0.20 \u00b1 0.07 cm(2)) than female participants (0.15 \u00b1 0.06 cm(2); P< .001). Age did not correlate with substantia nigra echogenicity in any group. Frontal horn width was larger and lenticular nucleus hyperechogenicity and a discontinuous raphe were more frequent in the PD group than the other groups. On multivariate analysis, only substantia nigra hyperechogenicity was associated with the diagnosis of PD. The 90th-percentile substantia nigra echogenic area in the control group, which defined marked substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, also represented the optimum cutoff value for discrimination of PD from non-PD participants on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (area under the curve, 0.913; Youden index, 0.73). This cutoff value (\u22650.21 cm(2), larger of bilateral measurements) yielded sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 90% for the diagnosis of PD.\nTranscranial sonography shows good diagnostic validity for diagnosis of PD when implemented according to a strictly standardized protocol.",

    "abstract": "Creatine is the substrate for creatine kinase in the synthesis of phosphocreatine (PCr). This energetic system is endowed of antioxidant and neuroprotective properties and plays a pivotal role in brain energy homeostasis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of creatine and PCr against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in rat striatal slices, used as an in vitro Parkinson's model. The possible involvement of the signaling pathway mediated by phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) was also evaluated. Exposure of striatal slices to 6-OHDA caused a significant disruption of the cellular homeostasis measured as 3-(4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide reduction, lactate dehydrogenase release, and tyrosine hydroxylase levels. 6-OHDA exposure increased the levels of reactive oxygen species and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances production and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in rat striatal slices. Furthermore, 6-OHDA decreased the phosphorylation of Akt (Serine(473)) and GSK3\u03b2 (Serine(9)). Coincubation with 6-OHDA and creatine or PCr reduced the effects of 6-OHDA toxicity. The protective effect afforded by creatine or PCr against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity was reversed by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. In conclusion, creatine and PCr minimize oxidative stress in striatum to afford neuroprotection of dopaminergic neurons.",

    "abstract": "We investigated early signs of Parkinson's disease-related impairment in mediolateral postural control. Thirty-six participants (18 Hoehn & Yahr stage 2 patients in the off-drug condition and 18 healthy controls) were studied in a stationary gaze condition and when performing 80\u00b0 lateral gaze shifts at 0.125 and 0.25 Hz. Body sway, coordination and postural control mechanisms were analyzed. All participants performed the visual tasks adequately. The patients were not unstable in the stationary gaze condition. In both groups, mediolateral ankle- and hip-based postural control mechanisms were significantly more active under gaze shift conditions than under the stationary gaze condition. As expected, the patients exhibited significantly greater angular movements of the lower back and significantly lower angular movements of the head (relative to controls) when performing gaze shifts. When considering linear displacements (rather than angular movements), the patients exhibited significantly greater displacements of the lower back and lower, slower displacements of the head than controls under gaze shift conditions. Relative to controls, the patients performed \"en block\" body movements. Overall, our results show that the patients' ankle- and hip-based mediolateral postural control mechanisms did not adapt to the difficulty of the visual task being performed.",

    "abstract": "Neuroprotection and neuroregeneration are two of the most promising disease-modifying therapies for the incurable and widespread Parkinson's disease. In Parkinson's disease, progressive degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons causes debilitating motor symptoms. Neurotrophic factors play important regulatory roles in the development, survival and maintenance of specific neuronal populations. These factors have the potential to slow down, halt or reverse the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. Several neurotrophic factors have been investigated in this regard. This review article discusses the neurodevelopmental roles and therapeutic potential of three dopaminergic neurotrophic factors: glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, neurturin and growth/differentiation factor 5.",

    "abstract": "Essential tremor is one of the most frequent movement disorders of humans and can be associated with substantial disability. Some but not all persons with essential tremor develop signs of Parkinson disease, and the relationship between the conditions has not been clear. In a six-generation consanguineous Turkish kindred with both essential tremor and Parkinson disease, we carried out whole exome sequencing and pedigree analysis, identifying HTRA2 p.G399S as the allele likely responsible for both conditions. Essential tremor was present in persons either heterozygous or homozygous for this allele. Homozygosity was associated with earlier age at onset of tremor (P < 0.0001), more severe postural tremor (P < 0.0001), and more severe kinetic tremor (P = 0.0019). Homozygotes, but not heterozygotes, developed Parkinson signs in the middle age. Among population controls from the same Anatolian region as the family, frequency of HTRA2 p.G399S was 0.0027, slightly lower than other populations. HTRA2 encodes a mitochondrial serine protease. Loss of function of HtrA2 was previously shown to lead to parkinsonian features in motor neuron degeneration (mnd2) mice. HTRA2 p.G399S was previously shown to lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, altered mitochondrial morphology, and decreased protease activity, but epidemiologic studies of an association between HTRA2 and Parkinson disease yielded conflicting results. Our results suggest that in some families, HTRA2 p.G399S is responsible for hereditary essential tremor and that homozygotes for this allele develop Parkinson disease. This hypothesis has implications for understanding the pathogenesis of essential tremor and its relationship to Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) mutations are responsible for an autosomal recessive, familial form of Parkinson's disease. PINK1 protein is a Ser/Thr kinase localized to the mitochondrial membrane and is involved in many processes including mitochondrial trafficking, mitophagy, and proteasomal function. Using a new PINK1 knockout (PINK1 KO) rat model, we found altered brain metabolomic markers using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, identified changes in mitochondrial pathways with quantitative proteomics using sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra (SWATH) mass spectrometry, and demonstrated mitochondrial functional alterations through measurement of oxygen consumption and acidification rates. The observed alterations included reduced creatine, decreased levels of complex I of the electron transport chain, and increased proton leak in the electron transport chain in PINK1 KO rat brains. In conjunction, these results demonstrate metabolomic and mitochondrial alterations occur during the asymptomatic phase of Parkinson's disease in this model. These results indicate both potential early diagnostic markers and therapeutic pathways that can be used in PD.",

    "abstract": "Exercise produces potential influences on physical and mental capacity in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, and can be made a viable form of therapy to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). We report the chronic effects of a regular physical exercise protocol on cognitive and motor functions, functional capacity, and symptoms in an elderly PD patient without dementia. The patient participated of a program composed of proprioceptive, aerobic and flexibility exercises, during 1 hour, three days a week, for nine months. Patient used 600 mg of L-DOPA daily, and 1 hour prior to each exercise session. Assessment was conducted in three stages, 0-3, 3-6 and 6 to 9 months, using percentual variation to the scales Hoehn and Yahr, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Parkinson Activity Scale (PAS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III). Reassessment showed clear changes in clinical parameters for Hoehn and Yahr (4 to 2.5), MMSE (14 to 22), PAS (13 to 29), BDI (9 to 7) and UPDRS-III (39 to 27) at the end of 9 months. According to our data, exercise seems to be effective in promoting the functional capacity and the maintenance of cognitive and motor functions of PD patients. Regular exercise protocols can be implemented as an adjunctive treatment for reducing the severity of PD.",

    "abstract": "Patients with freezing of gait (FOG) have more difficulty with switching tasks as well as controlling the spatiotemporal parameters of gait than patients without FOG. Objective. To compare the ability of patients with and without FOG to adjust their gait to sudden speed switching and to prolonged walking in asymmetrical conditions.\nGait characteristics of 10 freezers, 12 non-freezers, and 12 controls were collected during tied-belt conditions (3 and 4 km/h), motor switching and reswitching (increase of speed in one belt from 3 to 4 km/h and vice versa), and adaptation (adjustment to asymmetrical gait) and re-adaptation (returning to symmetrical gait) on a split-belt treadmill.\nFollowing switching, freezers showed the largest increase of step length asymmetry (P = .001). All groups gradually adapted their gait to asymmetrical conditions, but freezers were slower and demonstrated larger final asymmetry than the other 2 groups (P = .001). After reswitching, freezers again showed the largest step length asymmetry (P = .01). During re-adaptation, both controls and non-freezers reached symmetrical levels, but freezers did not. Interestingly, only immediately after switching did one episode of FOG and one episode of festination occur in 2 different patients.\nFreezers have more difficulties adapting their gait during both suddenly triggered and continued gait speed asymmetry. The impaired ability of freezers during both switching and reswitching would suggest that they have an adaptive deficit rather than difficulties with asymmetry per se. Future work needs to address whether these adaptation problems can be ameliorated with rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Vacuolar protein sorting 35 (VPS35) is a core component of the retromer complex, crucial to endosomal protein sorting and intracellular trafficking. We recently linked a mutation in VPS35 (p.D620N) to familial parkinsonism. Here, we characterize human VPS35 and retromer function in mature murine neuronal cultures and investigate neuron-specific consequences of the p.D620N mutation. We find VPS35 localizes to dendritic spines and is involved in the trafficking of excitatory AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). Fundamental neuronal processes, including excitatory synaptic transmission, AMPAR surface expression and synaptic recycling are altered by VPS35 overexpression. VPS35 p.D620N acts as a loss-of-function mutation with respect to VPS35 activity regulating synaptic transmission and AMPAR recycling in mouse cortical neurons and dopamine neuron-like cells produced from induced pluripotent stem cells of human p.D620N carriers. Such perturbations to synaptic function likely produce chronic pathophysiological stress upon neuronal circuits that may contribute to neurodegeneration in this, and other, forms of parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "It is important to elucidate the mechanism of dysautonomias in patients with Parkinson's disease; therefore, this study aimed to investigate the cardiovascular and autonomic changes that occur in an animal model of Parkinsonism. Adult male Wistar rats were anesthetized before bilateral microinfusions of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the substantia nigra. The sham group underwent the same surgical procedure but received vehicle. After 7 days, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were measured, and various drugs were injected into conscious rats through cannulas previously implanted in the femoral artery and vein. Spectral analyses of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and pulse interval (PI) were conducted with the CardioSeries software as the spontaneous baroreflex gain and effectivity. The animals were subjected to \u03b1-, \u03b2-adrenergic, or muscarinic receptor antagonism. For confirmation of the lesion, the levels of dopamine in the striatum were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Animals that underwent 6-OHDA microinfusion had lower MAP and HR compared with those in the sham group. Spectral analysis of SAP showed that 6-OHDA animals exhibited a decrease in the sympathetic component. The PI values did not differ between groups. After the administration of muscarinic and \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists, the cardiovascular measures did not differ between the groups. However, upon administration of the \u03b1-adrenergic antagonist, the 6-OHDA animals exhibited a lower decrease in the MAP. We report cardiovascular impairments in 6-OHDA animals, possibly due to decreased sympathetic activity. Determination of the origin of these changes (central or peripheral) requires further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The pathological role of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) aggregation in neurodegeneration is well recognized, but the physiological function of normal \u03b1-Syn remains unknown. As \u03b1-Syn protein contains multiple divalent metal binding sites, herein we conducted a comprehensive characterization of the role of \u03b1-Syn in manganese-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity. We established transgenic N27 dopaminergic neuronal cells by stably expressing human wild-type \u03b1-Syn at normal physiological levels. \u03b1-Syn-expressing dopaminergic cells significantly attenuated Mn-induced neurotoxicity for 24-h exposures relative to vector control cells. To further explore cellular mechanisms, we studied the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. Analysis of a key mitochondrial apoptotic initiator, cytochrome c, revealed that \u03b1-Syn significantly reduces the Mn-induced cytochrome c release into cytosol. The downstream caspase cascade, involving caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, during Mn exposure was also largely attenuated in Mn-treated \u03b1-Syn cells in a time-dependent manner. \u03b1-Syn cells also showed a dramatic reduction in the Mn-induced proteolytic activation of the pro-apoptotic kinase PKC\u03b4. The generation of Mn-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) did not differ between \u03b1-Syn and vector control cells, indicating that \u03b1-Syn exerts its protective effect independent of altering ROS generation. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) revealed no significant differences in intracellular Mn levels between treated vector and \u03b1-Syn cells. Notably, the expression of wild-type \u03b1-Syn in primary mesencephalic cells also rescued cells from Mn-induced neurotoxicity. However, prolonged exposure to Mn promoted protein aggregation in \u03b1-Syn-expressing cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that wild-type \u03b1-Syn exhibits neuroprotective effects against Mn-induced neurotoxicity during the early stages of exposure in a dopaminergic neuronal model of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and the parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy (MSAp) are neurodegenerative disorders that can be difficult to differentiate clinically. This study provides the first characterization of the patterns of task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) changes across the whole brain in MSAp. We used fMRI during a precision grip force task and also performed voxel-based morphometry (VBM) on T1 -weighted images in MSAp patients, PD patients, and healthy controls. All groups were matched on age, and the patient groups had comparable motor symptom durations and severities. There were three main findings. First, MSAp and PD had reduced fMRI activation in motor control areas, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, insula, primary sensorimotor and prefrontal cortices, and cerebellum compared with controls. Second, there were no activation differences among the disease groups in the basal ganglia, thalamus, insula, or primary sensorimotor cortices, but PD had more extensive activation deficits throughout the cerebrum compared with MSAp and controls. Third, VBM revealed reduced volume in the basal ganglia, middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles, pons, and throughout the cerebrum in MSAp compared with controls and PD, and additionally throughout the cerebellar cortex and vermis in MSAp compared with controls. Collectively, these results provide the first evidence that fMRI activation is abnormal in the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and cerebrum in MSAp, and that a key distinguishing feature between MSAp and PD is the extensive and widespread volume loss throughout the brain in MSAp.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated a higher prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) compared to controls. H. pylori infection affects levodopa absorption and its eradication significantly improves clinical response to levodopa. Here, we studied the prevalence of H. pylori infection and its eradication effects among our PD patients.\nA prospective study involving idiopathic PD patients on levodopa therapy. 13C-urea breath test (UBT) was used to detect H. pylori. UBT-positive patients were given standard eradication therapy and followed up at 6 and 12 weeks in an open label single arm design. Repeat UBT was performed at 12 weeks. The UPDRS, PD NMQ, PD NMSS and PDQ-39 were administered at baseline and post-eradication (6 and 12 weeks). Levodopa 'onset' time and ON-duration were recorded.\nOf 82 patients recruited, 27 (32.9%) had positive UBT. H. pylori-positive patients had significantly poorer total UPDRS (p\u200a=\u200a0.005) and PDQ39 (p<0.0001) scores compared to H. pylori-negative patients. At 12 weeks post-eradication, the mean levodopa onset time shortened by 14 minutes (p\u200a=\u200a0.011). The mean ON duration time increased by 56 minutes at week 6 (p\u200a=\u200a0.041) and 38 minutes at week 12 (p\u200a=\u200a0.035). The total UPDRS scores (p<0.0001), scores for parts II (p\u200a=\u200a0.001), III (p<0.0001) and IV (p\u200a=\u200a0.009) were significantly better. The total PDQ-39 scores (p\u200a=\u200a0.001) and subdomains mobility (p\u200a=\u200a0.002), ADL (p\u200a=\u200a0.001), emotional well being (p\u200a=\u200a0.026) and stigma (p\u200a=\u200a0.034) significantly improved. The PD NMSQ did not show significant improvement.\nH. pylori eradication improved levodopa onset time, ON duration, motor severity and quality of life parameters. Screening and eradication of H. pylori is inexpensive and should be recommended in PD patients, particularly those with erratic response to levodopa.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT02112812.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether certain CSF biomarkers at baseline can predict future progression of motor symptoms and cognitive decline in patients with Parkinson disease (PD).\nPatients and controls were recruited from hospitals in southern Sweden as part of the prospective and longitudinal Swedish BioFinder Study. In the present study, we included 42 patients with PD and 69 controls who had clinical assessment and lumbar puncture at baseline. Baseline CSF samples were analyzed for \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn), \u03b2-amyloid 1-42 (A\u03b242), tau, phosphorylated tau, and neurofilament light. Associations between CSF markers at baseline and change in clinical characteristics after 2 years of follow-up were investigated using multivariate models adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, and levodopa-equivalent daily dose.\nHigher levels of \u03b1Syn within the PD group were associated with progression of motor symptoms and cognitive decline over 2 years, indicated by significant relationships between \u03b1Syn and change in Hoehn and Yahr (\u03b2 = 0.394, p = 0.043), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Part III (UPDRS-III) (\u03b2 = 0.449, p = 0.013), Timed Up and Go (\u03b2 = 0.406, p = 0.023), and A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed (\u03b2 = 0.423, p = 0.018). Lower levels of A\u03b242 were associated with worsening of performance on delayed memory recall (F = 5.834, p = 0.022). Finally, high levels of phosphorylated tau were associated with worsening in motor symptoms (UPDRS-III, \u03b2 = 0.350, p = 0.045; Hoehn and Yahr, \u03b2 = 0.366, p = 0.038).\nWe found evidence of a link between higher levels of \u03b1Syn at baseline and worsening of motor symptoms and cognitive speed over 2 years in PD. Increased \u03b1Syn might be a marker of more intense synaptic degeneration in PD. The results indicate that cortical amyloid pathology (low CSF A\u03b242) is associated with memory decline.",

    "abstract": "A major trend in recent Parkinson's disease (PD) research is the investigation of biological markers that could help in identifying at-risk individuals or to track disease progression and response to therapies. Central to this is the knowledge that inflammation is a known hallmark of PD and of many other degenerative diseases. In the current work, we focus on inflammatory signalling in PD, using a systems approach that allows us to look at the disease in a more holistic way. We discuss cyclooxygenases, prostaglandins, thromboxanes and also iron in PD. These particular signalling molecules are involved in PD pathophysiology, but are also very important in an aberrant coagulation/hematology system. We present and discuss a hypothesis regarding the possible interaction of these aberrant signalling molecules implicated in PD, and suggest that these molecules may affect the erythrocytes of PD patients. This would be observable as changes in the morphology of the RBCs and of PD patients relative to healthy controls. We then show that the RBCs of PD patients are indeed rather dramatically deranged in their morphology, exhibiting eryptosis (a kind of programmed cell death). This morphological indicator may have useful diagnostic and prognostic significance.",

    "abstract": "Gait disturbances, including freezing of gait, are frequent and disabling symptoms of Parkinson's disease. They often respond poorly to dopaminergic treatments. Although recent studies have shed some light on their neural correlates, their modulation by dopaminergic treatment remains quite unknown. Specifically, the influence of levodopa on the networks involved in motor imagery (MI) of parkinsonian gait has not been directly studied, comparing the off and on medication states in the same patients. We therefore conducted an [H2 (15) 0] Positron emission tomography study in eight advanced parkinsonian patients (mean disease duration: 12.3 \u00b1 3.8 years) presenting with levodopa-responsive gait disorders and FoG, and eight age-matched healthy subjects. All participants performed three tasks (MI of gait, visual imagery and a control task). Patients were tested off, after an overnight withdrawal of all antiparkinsonian treatment, and on medication, during consecutive mornings. The order of conditions was counterbalanced between subjects and sessions. Results showed that imagined gait elicited activations within motor and frontal associative areas, thalamus, basal ganglia and cerebellum in controls. Off medication, patients mainly activated premotor-parietal and pontomesencephalic regions. Levodopa increased activation in motor regions, putamen, thalamus, and cerebellum, and reduced premotor-parietal and brainstem involvement. Areas activated when patients are off medication may represent compensatory mechanisms. The recruitment of these accessory circuits has also been reported for upper-limb movements in Parkinson's disease, suggesting a partly overlapping pathophysiology between imagined levodopa-responsive gait disorders and appendicular signs. Our results also highlight a possible cerebellar contribution in the pathophysiology of parkinsonian gait disorders through kinesthetic imagery.",

    "abstract": "Physical exercise has been associated with neuroprotective effects in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. To examine the impact of physical activity on Parkinson's disease risk prospectively, we followed 43 368 individuals who provided extensive information on physical activity at baseline. We estimated hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals using Cox proportional hazards regression. During an average of 12.6 years of follow-up, 286 incident Parkinson's disease cases were identified. In males, there was an inverse association with Parkinson's disease for total physical activity (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.35-0.87 for medium versus low level), for sum of household, commuting and leisure time exercise (hazard ratio 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.33-0.85 for high versus low level), and for household and commuting physical activity specifically (hazard ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.31-0.81 for >6 versus <2 h per week). No association was observed for leisure time exercise or occupational physical activity with Parkinson's disease, among either males or females. Meta-analysis of the present study and five previous prospective studies showed a pooled hazard ratio of 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.57-0.78) for highest versus lowest physical activity level. Our results indicate that a medium level of physical activity lowers Parkinson's disease risk.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this cross-sectional observational study was to quantify the pattern-shift visual evoked potentials (VEP) and the thickness as well as the volume of retinal layers using optical coherence tomography (OCT) across a cohort of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and age-matched controls.\nForty-three PD patients and 38 controls were enrolled. All participants underwent a detailed neurological and ophthalmologic evaluation. Idiopathic PD cases were included. Cases with glaucoma or increased intra-ocular pressure were excluded. Patients were assessed by VEP and high-resolution Fourier-domain OCT, which quantified the inner and outer thicknesses of the retinal layers. VEP latencies and the thicknesses of the retinal layers were the main outcome measures.\nThe mean age, with standard deviation (SD), of the PD patients and controls were 63.1 (7.5) and 62.4 (7.2) years, respectively. The patients were predominantly in the initial Hoehn-Yahr (HY) disease stages (34.8% in stage 1 or 1.5, and 55.8 % in stage 2). The VEP latencies and the thicknesses as well as the volumes of the retinal inner and outer layers of the groups were similar. A negative correlation between the retinal thickness and the age was noted in both groups. The thickness of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) was 102.7 \u03bcm in PD patients vs. 104.2 \u03bcm in controls.\nThe thicknesses of retinal layers, VEP, and RNFL of PD patients were similar to those of the controls. Despite the use of a representative cohort of PD patients and high-resolution OCT in this study, further studies are required to establish the validity of using OCT and VEP measurements as the anatomic and functional biomarkers for the evaluation of retinal and visual pathways in PD patients.",

An estimated 0.2% of Canadian adults in private households (55,000), and 4.9% of those in residential institutions (12,500), had Parkinson's disease. Younger age at symptom onset was associated with a longer period to disease diagnosis. As a result of the condition, 58% reported that social interactions were negatively affected, 61% reported out-of-pocket expenses, and 56% reported receiving assistance with activities such as housework, transportation or personal care. Among those receiving assistance, 84% relied at least in part on family, friends or neighbours. The primary informal caregiver tended to be a spouse (64%), female (62%), live in the same household (72%), and provide assistance on a daily basis (76%).",

    "abstract": "The orphan nuclear receptor NR4A2 (Nurr1) constitutively regulates inflammatory gene expression in glial cells by suppressing DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB. We recently reported that novel 1,1-bis(3'-indolyl)-1-(p-substitutedphenyl)methane (C-DIM) compounds that activate NR4A family nuclear receptors in cancer lines also suppress inflammatory gene expression in primary astrocytes and prevent loss of dopaminergic neurons in mice exposed to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and probenecid (MPTPp). In this study, we postulated that the basis for this neuroprotection involves blockade of glial activation and subsequent expression of NF-\u03baB-regulated inflammatory genes. To examine this mechanism, we treated transgenic NF-\u03baB/EGFP reporter mice with MPTPp for 7 days (MPTPp7d) followed by daily oral gavage with either vehicle (corn oil; MPTPp14d) or C-DIMs containing p-methoxyphenyl (C-DIM5), p-hydroxyphenyl (C-DIM8), or p-chlorophenyl (C-DIM12) groups. Each compound conferred significant protection against progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), even when given after 7 days of dosing with MPTPp. C-DIM12 had the greatest neuroprotective activity in MPTPp-treated mice, and was also the most potent compound in suppressing activation of microglia and astrocytes, expression of cytokines and chemokines in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) array studies, and in reducing expression of NF-\u03baB/EGFP in the SN. C-DIM12 prevented nuclear export of Nurr1 in dopaminergic neurons and enhanced expression of the Nurr1-regulated proteins tyrosine hydroxylase and the dopamine transporter. These data indicate that NR4A-active C-DIM compounds protect against loss of dopamine neurons in the MPTPp model of PD by preventing glial-mediated neuronal injury and by supporting a dopaminergic phenotype in TH-positive neurons in the SNpc.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often require surgery, and therefore may receive inhalation anesthesia. However, it is currently unknown whether inhalation anesthetics affect the prognosis of the disease. Leucine\u2011rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) genetic mutations are the most common cause of familial PD, contributing to ~39% of all cases in certain populations. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of inhaled anesthetics on PD, by observing the influence of sevoflurane on a LRRK2\u2011associated Drosophila model of PD. PD transgenic Drosophila overexpressing LRRK2 were generated by crossing flies expressing an LRRK2 upstream activation sequence, with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)\u2011Gal4 flies. Western blot analysis successfully verified that the transgenic Drosophila overexpressed LRRK2. Three days prior to eclosion, three genotypes of Drosophila were divided into four groups, and were exposed to air, 1, 2, or 3% sevoflurane, for 5 hours. Twenty\u2011four hours after the exposure, the electrophysiological activities of the projection neurons (PN) in the brains of the Drosophila were recorded using a patch clamp. The locomotor activities were tested on days 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 following eclosion. The frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents (mEPSCs) obtained from the PNs of the TH\u2011wild type LRRK2 (TH\u2011WT) Drosophila brain, following exposure to air (1.60\u00b10.05 Hz), was lower as compared with the wild type LRRK2 (WT) (2.51\u00b10.07 Hz) and W1118 (2.41\u00b10.10 Hz) Drosophila. After exposure to 1, 2 and 3% sevoflurane, the frequency of mEPSCs in the brains of the TH\u2011WT group decreased to 0.82\u00b10.04 Hz, 0.63\u00b10.16 Hz and 0.55\u00b10.04 Hz, respectively. The percentage decrease of the frequency of mEPSCs, from exposure to air to 1% sevoflurane, of the TH\u2011WT group (48.32%\u00b13.08%) was significantly higher, as compared with the WT (39.17%\u00b11.42%) and W1118 (35.10%\u00b12.66%) groups, and there was no statistical difference between the WT and W1118 groups. The transgenic TH\u2011WT Drosophila presented an early decrease in locomotor ability, as compared with the WT and W1118 groups. Following a 5 hour exposure to sevoflurane, the percentage decrease of the climbing abilities of the TH\u2011WT group, from exposure to air to 1% sevoflurane, were significantly lower, as compared with the WT and W1118 groups. In conclusion, sevoflurane had negative effects on the control W1118 flies, and also severely aggravated the prognosis of PD in the LRRK2\u2011associated Drosophila model, through synaptic cholinergic deficits and impairment on locomotor abilities.",

    "abstract": "Although often clinically indistinguishable in the early stages, Parkinson's disease (PD), Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) have distinct neuropathological changes. The aim of the current study was to identify white matter tract neurodegeneration characteristic of each of the three syndromes. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used to perform a whole-brain automated analysis of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data to compare differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) between the three clinical groups and healthy control subjects. Further analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between these putative indices of white matter microstructure and clinical measures of disease severity and symptoms. In PSP, relative to controls, changes in DTI indices consistent with white matter tract degeneration were identified in the corpus callosum, corona radiata, corticospinal tract, superior longitudinal fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, superior cerebellar peduncle, medial lemniscus, retrolenticular and anterior limb of the internal capsule, cerebral peduncle and external capsule bilaterally, as well as the left posterior limb of the internal capsule and the right posterior thalamic radiation. MSA patients also displayed differences in the body of the corpus callosum corticospinal tract, cerebellar peduncle, medial lemniscus, anterior and superior corona radiata, posterior limb of the internal capsule external capsule and cerebral peduncle bilaterally, as well as the left anterior limb of the internal capsule and the left anterior thalamic radiation. No significant white matter abnormalities were observed in the PD group. Across groups, MD correlated positively with disease severity in all major white matter tracts. These results show widespread changes in white matter tracts in both PSP and MSA patients, even at a mid-point in the disease process, which are not found in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) populations show that about 20% of patients meet criteria for restless legs syndrome (RLS). Nevertheless, pathological differences suggest RLS may actually prevent PD. Over 15 years, we collected patients with idiopathic RLS preceding onset of PD, as defined by onset of RLS greater than 5 years before motor symptoms of PD, or a family history of RLS and onset of RLS at least 1 year before PD. We then compared these to a control group of PD without RLS for demographics, age of onset, motor progression, dyskinesia, L-dopa equivalent dose, and PD phenotype at onset. The RLS/PD group (N = 36) had 13 females with 18 having a positive family history of RLS and six with a family history of PD. The PD control group (N = 36) had 10 females with 1 having a family history of RLS and nine with family history of PD. Age at motor onset of PD in the RLS/PD was older (64.15 \u00b1 6.44 years vs. 56.81 \u00b1 10.68) than for controls with PD (p < 0.001). After correcting for other risk factors and duration of follow-up, patients with idiopathic PD (21/36) developed dyskinesia more than RLS/PD (4/32) at final visit (p = 0.01). Our data suggest that idiopathic RLS may delay the onset of PD, reduce dyskinesia occurrence, and possibly reduce progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "Dysphagia, as a common finding in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, was estimated to be present in 80-95% of this population during different stages of the disease. The Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire (SDQ) was created as a self-rated dysphagia screening tool in PD. According to the guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation, Persian version of this questionnaire (SDQ-P) was developed. 59 Persian patients (39 men and 20 women) participated in the study. They responded to the SDQ-P and underwent videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). Aspiration during VFSS was compared with questionnaire results for each individual. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the questionnaire was 0.86 and based on SDQ-P 15 patients (25.4%) were dysphagic, while 10 patients (16.9%) showed aspiration during VFSS. SDQ-P sensitivity and specificity in predicting aspiration were 96.7 and 91.2%; therefore, the SDQ-P could be a prognostic tool for aspiration. The positive predictive value (PPV), the negative predictive value (NPV), and the pre- and posttest probabilities of aspiration were 0.67, 1, 16.9%, and 66.7%, respectively. In summary, this study demonstrated the reliability and also the feasibility of SDQ-P for screening of aspiration in Iranian patients with PD. Further evaluation of SDQ-P in larger subject population would be suggested.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, leading to a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms. Interestingly, non-motor symptoms often appear a decade or more before the first signs of motor symptoms. Some of these non-motor symptoms are remarkably similar to those observed in cases of impaired neurogenesis and several PD-related genes have been shown to play a role in embryonic or adult neurogenesis. Indeed, animal models deficient in Nurr1, Pitx3, SNCA and PINK1 display deregulated embryonic neurogenesis and LRRK2 and VPS35 have been implicated in neuronal development-related processes such as Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and neurite outgrowth. Moreover, adult neurogenesis is affected in both PD patients and PD animal models and is regulated by dopamine and dopaminergic (DA) receptors, by chronic neuroinflammation, such as that observed in PD, and by differential expression of wild-type or mutant forms of PD-related genes. Indeed, an increasing number of in vivo studies demonstrate a role for SNCA and LRRK2 in adult neurogenesis and in the generation and maintenance of DA neurons. Finally, the roles of PD-related genes, SNCA, LRRK2, VPS35, Parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1 have been studied in NSCs, progenitor cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, demonstrating a role for some of these genes in stem/progenitor cell proliferation and maintenance. Together, these studies strongly suggest a link between deregulated neurogenesis and the onset and progression of PD and present strong evidence that, in addition to a neurodegenerative disorder, PD can also be regarded as a developmental disorder.",

    "abstract": "Quality of life is poorer in Parkinson's disease than in other conditions and in the general population without Parkinson's disease. Malnutrition also results in poorer quality of life. This study aimed at determining the relationship between quality of life and nutritional status.\nCommunity-dwelling people with Parkinson's disease >18\u00a0years old were recruited. The Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) assessed nutritional status. The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39) measured quality of life. Phase I was cross-sectional. The malnourished in Phase I were eligible for a nutrition intervention phase, randomised into 2 groups: standard care (SC) with provision of nutrition education materials only and intervention (INT) with individualised dietetic advice and regular weekly follow-up. Data were collected at baseline, 6\u00a0weeks, and 12\u00a0weeks.\nPhase I consisted of 120 people who completed the PDQ-39. Phase II consisted of 9 in the SC group and 10 in the INT group. In Phase I, quality of life was poorer in the malnourished, particularly for mobility and activities of daily living domains. There was a significant correlation between PG-SGA and PDQ-39 scores (Phase I, rs\u2009=\u20090.445, p\u2009=\u2009.000; Phase II, rs\u2009=\u2009.426, p\u2009=\u2009.002). In Phase II, no significant difference in the PDQ-39 total or sub-scores was observed between the INT and SC groups; however, there was significant improvement in the emotional well-being domain for the entire group, X2(2)\u2009=\u20098.84, p\u2009=\u2009.012.\nMalnourished people with Parkinson's disease had poorer quality of life than the well-nourished, and improvements in nutritional status resulted in quality of life improvements. Attention to nutritional status is an important component of quality of life and therefore the total care of people with Parkinson's disease.\nACTRN12610000819022.",

    "abstract": "The Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS)-2 is a recently developed tool for evaluating disease-related nocturnal disturbances in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, its cutoff score has not been clinically assessed. We determined the optimal cutoff score of the Japanese version of the PDSS-2.\nPatients with PD (n = 146) and controls (n = 100) completed the PDSS-2 and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Poor sleepers were defined as having global PSQI scores >5. Optimal cutoff scores for determining poor sleepers were assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve.\nA PDSS-2 total score \u2265 14 exhibited 82.0% sensitivity and 70.6% specificity, whereas a PDSS-2 total score \u2265 15 provided 72.1% sensitivity and 72.9% specificity in distinguishing poor sleepers (PSQI score >5) from good sleepers (PSQI \u2264 5). Nocturnal disturbances were more frequently observed in patients with PD than in controls (PDSS-2 total score \u2265 14 or \u2265 15; 51.4% vs 20%; 45.9% vs 19%). Nocturnal disturbances were associated with higher Hoehn and Yahr stages and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores, impaired quality of life, daytime sleepiness, and depressive symptoms.\nWe suggest that PDSS-2 total scores \u2265 15 are useful for detecting poor sleepers among patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Muscle spindles endings are extremely sensitive to externally applied vibrations, and under such circumstances they convey proprioceptive inflows to the central nervous system that modulate the spinal reflexes excitability or the muscle responses elicited by postural perturbations. The aim of this pilot study is to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a balance training program in association with a wearable proprioceptive stabilizer (Equistasi) that emits focal mechanical vibrations in patients with PD.\nForty patients with PD were randomly divided in two groups wearing an active or inactive device. All the patients received a 2-month intensive program of balance training. Assessments were performed at baseline, after the rehabilitation period (T1), and two more months after (T2). Posturographic measures were used as primary endpoint; secondary measures of outcome included the number of falls and several clinical scales for balance and quality of life.\nBoth groups improved at the end of the rehabilitation period and we did not find significant between-group differences in any of the principal posturographic measures with the exception of higher sway area and limit of stability on the instrumental functional reach test during visual deprivation at T1 in the Equistasi group. As for the secondary outcome, we found an overall better outcome in patients enrolled in the Equistasi group: 1) significant improvement at T1 on Berg Balance Scale (+45.0%, p =\u200a.026), Activities-specific Balance Confidence (+83.7, p =\u200a.004), Falls Efficacy Scale (-33.3%, p =\u200a.026) and PDQ-39 (-48.8%, p =\u200a.004); 2) sustained improvement at T2 in terms of UPDRS-III, Berg Balance Scales, Time Up and Go and PDQ-39; 3) significant and sustained reduction of the falls rate.\nThis pilot trial shows that a physiotherapy program for training balance in association with focal mechanical vibration exerted by a wearable proprioceptive stabilizer might be superior than rehabilitation alone in improving patients' balance.\nEudraCT 2013-003020-36 and ClinicalTrials.gov (number not assigned).",

    "abstract": "Purpose. To investigate changes in vowel articulation with the electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in dysarthric speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods. Eight Quebec-French speakers diagnosed with idiopathic PD who had undergone STN DBS were evaluated ON-stimulation and OFF-stimulation (1 hour after DBS was turned off). Vowel articulation was compared ON-simulation versus OFF-stimulation using acoustic vowel space and formant centralization ratio, calculated with the first (F1) and second formant (F2) of the vowels /i/, /u/, and /a/. The impact of the preceding consonant context on articulation, which represents a measure of coarticulation, was also analyzed as a function of the stimulation state. Results. Maximum vowel articulation increased during ON-stimulation. Analyses also indicate that vowel articulation was modulated by the consonant context but this relationship did not change with STN DBS. Conclusions. Results suggest that STN DBS may improve articulation in dysarthric speakers with PD, in terms of range of movement. Optimization of the electrical parameters for each patient is important and may lead to improvement in speech fine motor control. However, the impact on overall speech intelligibility may still be small. Clinical considerations are discussed and new research avenues are suggested.",

    "abstract": "To explore the incidence of cognitive dysfunction and associated factors in 62 essential tremor (ET) cases, 60 normal controls and 61 Parkinson's disease (PD) cases.\nA total of 62 ET and 61 PD patients from September 2009 to September 2013 were recruited from our outpatient clinic. ET patients received the Tremor Rating Scale for Tremor-motor examination (items 1-15 of rating scale) while 61 PD patients were examined with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-motor examination and a modified Hoehn and Yahr scale for staging disorder severity. All participants completed Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Beijing version for measuring cognitive functions. And depression was evaluated by the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). The serum levels of uric acid were tested.\nA MoCA score <26 (at least mildly cognitive) was observed in 14 (23.3%) normal controls, compared to 24 (38.7%) ET cases and 27 (44.3%) PD cases (P = 0.045 when comparing all 3 groups, and P = 0.532 when comparing ET and PD). The factor scores of visual space/execution were 4.1 \u00b1 1.0, 3.8 \u00b1 1.1 and 3.2 \u00b1 1.6 in normal controls, ET and PD patients, the factor scores of naming 2.9 \u00b1 0.4, 2.8 \u00b1 0.6 and 2.3 \u00b1 0.8 in control, ET and PD patients, the factor scores of delay memory 3.9 \u00b1 0.9, 2.7 \u00b1 1.3 and 2.5 \u00b1 1.7 in control, ET and PD patients. Statistical differences existed in visual space/execution, naming and delay memory (P < 0.05) among 3 groups. Yet there were no statistical differences in attention, language, abstract and directional among 3 groups. Statistical differences existed in visual space/execution and naming between ET and PD patients (P < 0.05). PD cases had the lowest visual space/execution score, followed by ET (intermediate) and highest scores in controls (P < 0.05). In ET patients, cognitive scores were correlated with serum levels of uric acid, education, tremor Rating Scale for Tremor-motor subscale score and depression levels (r = 0.589, P = 0.000; r = 0.449, P = 0.010; r = 0.452, P = 0.009; r = 0.466, P = 0.025). In PD patients, cognitive scores correlated with serum levels of uric acid, education, score of UPDRS-III and depression levels (r = 0.694, P = 0.000; r = 0.614, P = 0.000; r = 0.604, P = 0.000; r = 0.376, P = 0.000).\nThe incidence of cognition is higher in ET and PD. There were no significant inter-group differences for cognition frequency. The most frequently endorsed symptoms were poor visual spatial ability, execution disturbance and delayed recall disorders. Some connition scores in ET were intermediate between those of PD cases and normal controls. Thus a mild form of connition dysregulation may be present in ET. The degree of cognition symptoms is correlated with serum levels of uric acid, education and serious motor.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration is the progressive loss of neuronal structure and function, which ultimately leads to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Even after the recent significant advances in neurobiology, the above-mentioned disorders continue to haunt the global population. Several studies have suggested the role of specific environmental and genetic risk factors associated with these disorders. However, the exact mechanism associated with the progression of these disorders still needs to be elucidated. In the recent years, sophisticated research has revealed interesting association of prominent neurodegenerative disorders such as AD and PD with chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Several common molecular mechanisms such as generation of free radicals, oxidative DNA damage, aberrations in mitochondrial DNA, and dysregulation of apoptosis have been highlighted as possible points of connection. The present review summarizes the possible mechanism of coexistence of AD and PD with other chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "To explore the effect of fucoidan treatment on oxidative stress-mediated dopaminergic neuronal damage and its potential mechanisms.\nThe effect of fucoidan was investigated in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of PD, an animal model considered appropriate for preclinical studies of PD therapy. The effects of fucoidan treatment on animal behavior and the survival ratio of dopaminergic neurons were investigated. We further observed the effect of fucoidan on microglia and the NADPH oxidases-1 (Nox1), a family of enzymes generating reactive oxygen species (ROS).\nWe found that chronic fucoidan administration mitigated the motor dysfunction induced by 6-OHDA. Similarly, fucoidan reduced the loss of DA neurons in the SNc and DA fibers in the striatum in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Moreover, we found that fucoidan inhibited the 6-OHDA-stimulating expression of Nox1 in both tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons and non-TH-positive neurons, prevented Nox1-sensitive oxidative stress and cell damage in SNc neurons. Fucoidan also effectively inhibited nigral microglial activation.\nThese results support the beneficial effect of fucoidan in 6-OHDA-lesioned rat model of PD. Fucoidan may suppress the Nox1-triggered oxidative stress in the SNc to protect DA neurons from 6-OHDA-induced toxicity and achieve its beneficial effect.",

    "abstract": "The role that oestradiol and testosterone play in Parkinson's disease and their potential to influence the course of the disease has been covered in medical literature. The aim of this work was to compare oestradiol, testosterone, sex hormone-binding protein and prolactin blood levels in males affected with Parkinson's disease and in an age-matched control group, and to show possible dependence between concentrations of plasma hormones and the progression of symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\nThe plasma levels of oestradiol, testosterone, prolactin and sex hormone-binding protein were examined in 36 patients affected with Parkinson's disease and in 69 age-matched control subjects, using chemiluminescent reactions. Patients with Parkinson's disease were examined using scales assessing their clinical state.\nThe level of prolactin was higher in the affected group. Concentrations of oestradiol and testosterone in the control group exceeded those found in patients. The level of sex hormones was positively correlated with better mood and quality of life in patients affected with Parkinson's disease; prolactin levels correlated negatively with sex steroid concentrations.\nLower blood levels of sex steroids and higher concentrations of prolactin and its antigonadotrophic activity in males affected with Parkinson's disease may result in a bigger susceptibility to the disease in men. The level of hormones may influence patients' cognition, mood and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal accumulation of iron is observed in neurodegenerative disorders. In Parkinson's disease, an excess of iron has been demonstrated in different structures of the basal ganglia and is suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Using the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of Parkinson's disease, the edematous effect of 6-OHDA and its relation with striatal iron accumulation was examined utilizing in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The results revealed that in comparison with control animals, injection of 6-OHDA into the rat striatum provoked an edematous process, visible in T2-weighted images that was accompanied by an accumulation of iron clearly detectable in T2*-weighted images. Furthermore, Prussian blue staining to detect iron in sectioned brains confirmed the existence of accumulated iron in the areas of T2* hypointensities. The presence of ED1-positive microglia in the lesioned striatum overlapped with this accumulation of iron, indicating areas of toxicity and loss of dopamine nerve fibers. Correlation analyses demonstrated a direct relation between the hyperintensities caused by the edema and the hypointensities caused by the accumulation of iron.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to assess atrial fibrillation (AF) and vulnerability in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome patients using two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE).\nAll patients were examined via transthoracic echocardiography and 2D-STE in order to assess atrial function 7 days before and 10 days after RF catheter ablation. A postoperative 3-month follow-up was performed via outpatient visit or telephone calls.\nResults showed significant differences in both body mass index (BMI) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) duration between WPW patients and DAVNP patients (both P<0.05). Echocardiography revealed that the maximum left atrial volume (LAVmax) and the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in diastole increased noticeably in patients with WPW compared to patients with DAVNP both before and after ablation (all P<0.05). Before ablation, there were obvious differences in the levels of SRs, SRe, and SRa from the 4-chamber view (LA) in the WPW patients group compared with patients in the DAVNP group (all P<0.05). In the AF group, there were significant differences in the levels of systolic strain rate (SRs), early diastolic strain rate (SRe), and late diastolic strain rate (SRa) from the 4-chamber view (LA) both before and after ablation (all P<0.05). In the non-AF group, there were decreased SRe levels from the 4-chamber view (LA/RA) pre-ablation compared to post-ablation (all P<0.05).\nOur findings provide convincing evidence that WPW syndrome may result in increased atrial vulnerability and contribute to the development of AF. Further, RF catheter ablation of AAV pathway can potentially improve atrial function in WPW syndrome patients. Two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography imaging in WPW patients would be necessary in the evaluation and improvement of the overall function of RF catheter ablation in a long-term follow-up period.",

    "abstract": "Sirtuins, NAD(+) -dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs), have recently emerged as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of a variety of diseases. The discovery of potent and isoform-selective inhibitors of this enzyme family should provide chemical tools to help determine the roles of these targets and validate their therapeutic value. Herein, we report the discovery of a novel class of highly selective SIRT2 inhibitors, identified by pharmacophore screening. We report the identification and validation of 3-((2-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)methyl)-7-((pyridin-3-ylmethyl)amino)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobenzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one (ICL-SIRT078), a substrate-competitive SIRT2 inhibitor with a Ki value of 0.62 \u00b1 0.15 \u03bcM and more than 50-fold selectivity against SIRT1, 3 and 5. Treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with ICL-SIRT078 results in hyperacetylation of \u03b1-tubulin, an established SIRT2 biomarker, at doses comparable with the biochemical IC50 data, while suppressing MCF-7 proliferation at higher concentrations. In concordance with the recent reports that suggest SIRT2 inhibition is a potential strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, we find that compound ICL-SIRT078 has a significant neuroprotective effect in a lactacystin-induced model of Parkinsonian neuronal cell death in the N27 cell line. These results encourage further investigation into the effects of ICL-SIRT078, or an optimised derivative thereof, as a candidate neuroprotective agent in in vivo models of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) can improve the life quality of patients with advanced Parkinson disease (PD). However, previous studies have stemmed mainly from Western centers. Present study analyzed the 6-month outcomes of bilateral STN-DBS therapy that were observed during a 9-year period at a Taiwanese institute. We retrospectively reviewed 72 consecutive patients, whose mean disease history was 8 years when they underwent surgery. The median \"drug-off\" Hoehn and Yahr stage was 3. The STN was targeted using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological guidance. The over-time mean differences in the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and daily levodopa-equivalent dose (LED) were assessed using the repeated measurements ANOVA at 3 and 6 months relative to those of presurgical drug-off baseline. At 6 months postsurgery, the mean UPDRS total, Part II and Part III subscores significantly decreased by 27, 30 and 25 %, respectively, with clinically high effect size. Tremors were markedly (66 %) ameliorated. Moreover, problems of akinesia, rigidity, and locomotion were significantly improved by 20 %. The mean daily LED needs decreased by 25 %; thus, drug-induced dyskinesia was markedly (80 %) diminished. STN-DBS therapy could provide similarly effective impacts to Eastern and Western PD patients. Preoperative optimal selection of patients and postoperative delicate programming ensure a better surgical improvement.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins, namely phosphorylation, induce abnormalities in the biological properties of recipient proteins, underlying neurological diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). Genome-wide studies link genes encoding \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) and Tau as two of the most important in the genesis of PD. Although several kinases are known to phosphorylate \u03b1-Syn and Tau, we focused our analysis on GSK-3\u03b2 because of its accepted role in phosphorylating Tau and to increasing evidence supporting a strong biophysical relationship between \u03b1-Syn and Tau in PD. Therefore, we investigated transgenic mice, which express a point mutant (S9A) of human GSK-3\u03b2. GSK-3\u03b2-S9A is capable of activation through endogenous natural signaling events, yet is unable to become inactivated through phosphorylation at serine-9. We used behavioral, biochemical, and in vitro analysis to assess the contributions of GSK-3\u03b2 to both \u03b1-Syn and Tau phosphorylation. Behavioral studies revealed progressive age-dependent impairment of motor function, accompanied by loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+ DA-neurons) neurons and dopamine production in the oldest age group. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed deterioration of the substantia nigra in aged mice, a characteristic feature of PD patients. At the molecular level, kinase-active p-GSK-3\u03b2-Y216 was seen at all ages throughout the brain, yet elevated levels of p-\u03b1-Syn-S129 and p-Tau (S396/404) were found to increase with age exclusively in TH+ DA-neurons of the midbrain. p-GSK-3\u03b2-Y216 colocalized with p-Tau and p-\u03b1-Syn-S129. In vitro kinase assays showed that recombinant human GSK-3\u03b2 directly phosphorylated \u03b1-Syn at a single site, Ser129, in addition to its known ability to phosphorylate Tau. Moreover, \u03b1-Syn and Tau together cooperated with one another to increase the magnitude or rate of phosphorylation of the other by GSK-3\u03b2. Together, these data establish a novel upstream role for GSK-3\u03b2 as one of several kinases associated with PTMs of key proteins known to be causal in PD.",
