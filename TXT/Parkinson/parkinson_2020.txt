    "abstract": "Impaired self-awareness of cognitive deficits (ISAcog) has rarely been investigated in Parkinson's disease (PD). ISAcog is associated with poorer long-term outcome in other diseases. This study examines ISAcog in PD with and without mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), compared to healthy controls, and its clinical-behavioral and neuroimaging correlates.\nWe examined 63 PD patients and 30 age- and education-matched healthy controls. Cognitive state was examined following the Movement Disorder Society Level II criteria. ISAcog was determined by subtracting \nPD-MCI patients (\nSimilar to Alzheimer's disease, the cingulate cortex seems to be relevant in ISAcog in PD. In PD-MCI patients, ISAcog might result from a disrupted network that regulates awareness of cognition and error processes.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory studies identified changes in the metabolism of halogens in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Parkinson's disease, which indicates the presence of \"accelerated self-halogenation\" of CSF and/or an increase in haloperoxidases, specifically serum thyroperoxidase and CSF lactoperoxidase. Furthermore, an excess of some halogenated derivatives, such as advanced oxygenation protein products (AOPP), has been detected in the CSF and serum. \"Accelerated self-halogenation\" and increased levels of haloperoxidases and AOPP proteins indicate that halogenative stress is present in Parkinson's disease. In addition, 3-iodo-L-tyrosine, a halogenated derivative, shows \"parkinsonian\" toxicity in experimental models, since it has been observed to induce \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and damage to dopaminergic neurons in the mouse brain and intestine. The hypothesis is that patients with Parkinson's disease display halogenative stress related to a haloenzymatic alteration of the synthesis or degradation of oxyacid of halogens and their halogenated derivatives. This halogenative stress would be related to nervous system damage.",

    "abstract": "Various factors, such as fear of falling, postural instability, and altered executive function, contribute to the high risk of falling in Parkinson's disease (PD). Dual-task training is an established method to reduce this risk. Motor-perceptual task combinations typically require a patient to walk while simultaneously engaging in a perceptual task. Motor-executive dual-tasking (DT) combines locomotion with executive function tasks. One augmented reality treadmill training (AR-TT) study revealed promising results of a perceptual dual-task training with a markedly reduced frequency of falls especially in patients with PD. We here propose to compare the effects of two types of concurrent tasks, perceptual and executive, on high-intensity TT). Patients will be trained with TT alone, in combination with an augmented reality ",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest movements of speech and gait in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) are impaired by a common underlying rhythmic dysfunction. If this being the case, motor deficits in speech and gait should equally benefit from rhythmic interventions regardless of whether it is a speech-specific or step-training-specific approach.\nIn this intervention trial, we studied the effects of two rhythmic interventions on speech and gait. These rhythmic intervention programs are similar in terms of intensity and frequency (i.e., 3x per week, 45 min-long sessions for 4 weeks in total), but differ regarding therapeutic approach (rhythmic speech vs. rhythmic balance-mobility training).\nThis study is a cross-over, parallel multi-arms, single blind intervention trial, in which PD patients treated with rhythmic speech-language therapy (rSLT; \nParameters in speech and gait (i.e., speaking and walking velocity, as well as speech rhythm with gait cadence) were positively correlated across groups (\nSpeech and gait deficits in PD may share a common mechanism in the underlying cortical circuits. Further, rSLT was more beneficial to dysrhythmic PD patients than rBMT, likely because of the nature of the rhythmic cue.",

    "abstract": "Comprehensive hand function in people with Parkinson disease (PD) has been underevaluated. The objectives were to compare self-perceived and objective hand functions of PD and controls, compare outcomes between more and less affected hand subgroups, and evaluate relationship between self-perceived and objective outcomes in subgroups.\nA total of 165 PD and 82 healthy participants completed the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test, Purdue Pegboard Test, grip strength test, and Manual Ability Measure-16 in a cross-sectional study. PD participants completed the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39. Associations between objective and self-perceived/quality of life outcomes in PD groups were analyzed, and nondominant and dominant more affected subgroups performance was compared.\nPD participants had significantly worse performance in most Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test and all Purdue Pegboard Test items, lower Manual Ability Measure-16 scores, and poorer handgrip strength. Weak associations were found between dexterity, but not grip strength, and self-perceived functional hand ability and Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39 scores in PD subgroups. For nondominant more affected subgroup, poorer dexterity was associated with better Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39 Activity of Daily Living domain scores.\nPeople with mild to moderate PD were shown to have poorer manual dexterity, reduced grip strength, and lower self-perceived functional hand ability than controls. Associations between dexterity and self-perceived outcomes highlight the importance of unimanual and bimanual training.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is considered as a motor disorder that affects some Parkinson's disease (PD) patients; however, sensory systems may also be involved in FOG. The pupil light reflex (PLR) is a reliable measure of the autonomic nervous system. Different dilation and constriction pupil parameters may be used to investigate the integrity of the autonomic nervous system in PD patients with and without FOG symptoms. This study aimed to look at the integrity of autonomic nervous system and to investigate the nonmotor functions mediated by the cholinergic system in Parkinson's patients with and without FOG symptoms.\nConstriction and dilation pupil light reflexes were measured by using a handheld pupillometer. Twenty-two patients with FOG symptoms, 25 patients without FOG symptoms, and 25 aged-matched healthy controls participated in this study.\nThe results showed that most of the constriction parameters and dilation latency of both patient groups differed significantly from healthy controls. FOG patients showed larger pupil size under light condition and larger deficits in constriction latency than nonFOG patients. Both the groups of PD patients had longer dilation latencies than healthy controls.\nThis study suggests that the cholinergic autonomic nervous system is affected in PD patients more than the adrenergic system. FOG patients had larger impairments in nondopaminergic mediated functions such as pupil light reflexes, which suggests that FOG patients have greater impairment in functions that involve cholinergic neurotransmitters.",

    "abstract": "In daily functional activities, the body needs the ability to perform two or more tasks at the same time (such as talking while walking). However, the gait disorder of patients with Parkinson's disease is aggravated when performing dual tasks, which seriously affects their quality of life. Therefore, the medical management plan should offer effective exercise training programming to improve Parkinson's disease patients' ability to perform dual tasks. Most traditional exercise intervention methods only focus on the perspective of exercise or cognition, ignoring their interaction, and fail to adequately resolve the dual task obstacles associated with Parkinson's disease. Some scholars put forward the concept of dual-task training and have applied dual-task training to patients with neurological disorders and have achieved good therapeutic effects. Therefore, this article summarizes the research literature concerning dual-task training to improve cognitive impairment and walking function of Parkinson's disease patients, to evaluate and discuss possible mechanisms of action, and provide a basis for adjuvant treatment and rehabilitation of Parkinson's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "This work proposes new fractional-order (FO) models of six chaotic diseases whose fractional dynamics have not been studied so far in literature. Secondly, design and analysis of suitable controllers to control chaos where present, and that of anticontrollers to generate chaos where absent, for these newly proposed FO models of diseases, are put forward. The proposed controllers and anticontrollers address the problem of the health hazards arising from the dysfunctionalities due to the impact of chaos in these biological models. Controllers to supress chaos in four diseases, namely, FO Diabetes Mellitus, FO Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), FO Ebola Virus and FO Dengue models are designed by Back-stepping, Adaptive Feedback and Sliding Mode Control strategies, whereas anticontrollers to introduce chaos in diseases, namely, FO Parkinson's illness and FO Migraine models, are carried out by Linear State Feedback, Single State Sinusoidal Feedback and Sliding Mode Anticontrol strategies. The equilibrium points, eigenvalues and Lyapunov Exponents of the FO disease models are evaluated and indicate the significance of chaos in them and necessitate upon the requirement of controllers and anticontrollers accordingly. The simulation results in terms of bifurcation diagrams, time series plots and phase portraits confirm the successful accomplishment of the control objectives.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms due to loss of striatal dopaminergic neurons and disruption of degradation signaling leading to the formation of Lewy bodies (aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein). Presently, there are no disease modifying therapy for PD despite improvement in the understanding of the disease pathogenesis. However, the drugs currently used in PD management provide symptomatic relieve for motor symptoms without significant improvement in non-motor complications, thus, a public health burden on caregivers and healthcare systems. There is therefore the need to discover disease modifying therapy with strong potential to halt the disease progression. Recent trend has shown that the dysfunction of lysosomal-autophagy pathway is highly implicated in PD pathology, hence, making autophagy a key player owing to its involvement in degradation and clearance of misfolded \u03b1-synuclein (a major hallmark in PD pathology). In this review, we described the current drugs/strategy in the management of PD including targeting the autophagy pathway as a novel approach that could serve as potential intervention for PD management. The discovery of small molecules or natural products capable of enhancing autophagy mechanism could be a promising strategy for PD treatment.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) in Western Turkey, which encompasses Edirne and its surrounding districts.\nIn this study, 9887 individuals, able to communicate and agreed to participate in the study, were evaluated. The data was obtained by answering a face-to-face questionnaire consisting of 53 questions from volunteers living at 30 randomly selected family health centers in Edirne and its counties. The questionnaire included demographic information, questions to evaluate potential concomitant conditions, and questions regarding the symptomatology used in IPD diagnosis. Following the questionnaire, it was planned to determine the degree of IPD with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Hoehn and Yahr scale (HY) clinical rating scale in patients diagnosed with IPD to assess disease severity in patients diagnosed with IPD.\nOf the 9887 individuals, 118 were diagnosed with IPD according to the questionnaire results from Edirne and its districts, and the prevalence of IPD was 1.2%. Approximately, 58.4% of the patients with IPD were male and 41.6% were female, which was not significantly different (p=0.214). Non-motor symptoms such as difficulty urinating, anxiety, depression, fatigue, REM sleep behavior disorder, and difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep were also examined in patients diagnosed with IPD. Depression was identified in 45.7% of the cases, while the control group was 4.3% (p=0.001). Fatigue was identified in 46.8% of the cases and control group was 3.5% (p=0.002).\nIPD prevalence studies will increase the awareness in the community and provide early diagnosis and treatment as well as serve as a basis to increased life expectancy, reduce morbidity, and improve life quality.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), verb-naming tasks (VNTs) have been proposed as superior to noun-naming ones in detecting language deficits, although such a hypothesis is not supported at a statistical level.\nThe main aim of this study was to provide diagnostic accuracy evidence for a VNT and noun-naming task (NNT) in detecting cognitive impairment (CI) in PD patients.\nThirty-three consecutive PD patients were subdivided into participants with (PD-CI; N = 12) or without CI (cognitively unimpaired, PD-CU; N = 21), based on a raw score \u226425 or >25 on the Mini-Mental State Examination, respectively. The NNT and VNT by Neuropsychologia [2006 Jan;44(1):73-89] were administered. Diagnostic accuracy of the NNT and VNT was assessed through receiver-operating characteristics analyses by comparing PD-CU to PD-CI patients. At the optimal cut-off, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV), and likelihood ratios (LR+, LR-) were separately tested for the NNT and VNT against PD-CU versus PD-CI classification.\nDiagnostic accuracy was higher for the NNT (AUC = 0.85; p = 0.001) versus the VNT (AUC = 0.68; p = 0.092). Consistently, the NNT yielded higher sensitivity, specificity, and post-test features than the VNT (NNT: sensitivity = 0.75, specificity = 0.81, PPV = 0.69, NPV = 0.85, LR+ = 3.94, LR- = 0.31; VNT: sensitivity = 0.67, specificity = 0.67, PPV = 0.53, NPV = 0.78, LR+ = 2, LR- = 0.5).\nIn accordance with the Movement Disorders Society guidelines, NNTs are diagnostically sound psychometric instruments to discriminate PD patients with versus without CI. However, these findings need replication by (1) employing a gold standard different from the Mini-Mental State Examination, which does not capture the full range of CI in this population and (2) subdividing PD patients into those with mild CI and dementia.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most neurodegenerative disease caused due to synucleinopathy leads to the death of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons. The approach to reduce synucleinopathy paves the therapeutic way in PD management. Recent studies highlight anti-Parkinsonism effect of Hytrin that regulates energy homeostasis via activation of mitochondrial redox regulator; IDH2 leading to attenuation of synucleinopathy. However, the burst release kinetics of Hytrin restricts its therapeutic potential. Therefore, we aimed to improve Hytrin release kinetics through nanocarrier mediated delivery, replenish dopamine and serotonin by formulating Hytrin loaded polydopamine serotonin nanohybrid for PD protection. Present study also explores IDH2 mediated neuroprotective action in retardation of synucleinopathy for PD prevention. Nanoformulation has shown effective neurotherapeutic potential by improving Hytrin release profile in the reduction of PD symptoms in vitro and ex vivo. The neuroprotective effect has been attributed to IDH2 induction and alpha-synuclein reduction against rotenone insults. The direct physical interaction of IDH2 and alpha-synuclein, PD hallmark has been uncovered. The study divulges that the restorative effect of our nanoformulation significantly retards the PD deficits byinducing IDH2 mediated alpha-synuclein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation pathway.",

Parkinson's disease is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease in which inflammation plays an important role for its progression. A vast number of studies suggest that there is a potential connection between chronic periodontitis and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Individuals with Parkinson's disease usually have poor periodontal health, and their oral flora composition differs from that of healthy people; at the same time, patients with chronic periodontitis have a higher risk of Parkinson's disease, which can be reduced with regular periodontal treatment. In fact, the mechanism of interaction between chronic periodontitis and Parkinson's disease is not clear. According to several studies, the clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease prevent patients to maintain oral hygiene effectively, increasing the risk of periodontitis. Neuroinflammation mediated by microglia may be the key to the influence of chronic periodontitis on Parkinson's disease. Periodontal pathogens and inflammatory mediators may enter the brain and activate microglia in various ways, and ultimately leading to occurrence and development of Parkinson's disease. This article reviews the recent research progress on the association between chronic periodontitis and Parkinson's disease, and its potential mechanism to provide information for further research.\nChronic periodontitis is an infectious disease, which has a reciprocal relationship with a variety of systemic disorders.

    "abstract": "Classifying SPECT images requires a preprocessing step which normalizes the images using a normalization region. The choice of the normalization region is not standard, and using different normalization regions introduces normalization region-dependent variability. This paper mathematically analyzes the effect of the normalization region to show that normalized-classification is exactly equivalent to a subspace separation of the half rays of the images under multiplicative equivalence. Using this geometry, a new self-normalized classification strategy is proposed. This strategy eliminates the normalizing region altogether. The theory is used to classify DaTscan images of 365 Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects and 208 healthy control (HC) subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI). The theory is also used to understand PD progression from baseline to year 4.",

    "abstract": "To explore the abnormal brain activity of early Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment (ePD-MCI) patients, the study analyzed the dynamic fluctuation of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and the dynamic change of information communication between EEG signals of ePD-MCI patients. In this study, we recorded resting-state EEG signals of 30 ePD-MCI patients and 37 early Parkinson's disease without mild cognitive impairment (ePD-nMCI) patients. First, we analyzed the difference of the complexity of EEG signals between the two groups. And we found that the complexity in the ePD-MCI group was significantly higher than that in the ePD-nMCI group. Then, by analyzing the dynamic functional network (DFN) topology based on the optimal sliding-window, we found that the temporal correlation coefficients of ePD-MCI patients were lower in the delta and theta bands than those in the ePD-nMCI patients. The temporal characteristic path length of ePD-MCI patients in the alpha band was higher than that of ePD-nMCI patients. In the theta and alpha bands, the temporal small world degrees of ePD-MCI patients were lower than that of patients with ePD-nMCI. In addition, the functional connectivity strength of ePD-MCI patients affected by cognitive impairment was weaker than that of ePD-nMCI patients, and the stability of dynamic functional connectivity network was decreased. This finding may serve as a biomarker to identify ePD-MCI and contribute to the early intervention treatment of ePD-MCI.",

    "abstract": "The goal of dopaminergic replacement therapy to achieve good clinical outcome in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients largely depends on the pattern of adherence to the pharmacological treatment. This study aims to find the factors affecting medication adherence in patients with PD keeping in mind the cultural, economic, and social diversities so that preventive steps can be taken to fill these gaps.\nDemographic data, disease parameters, treatment-related factors, family characteristics, educational, and employment status were assessed for relationship with the medication adherence pattern in a cohort of non-demented PD patients. Medication adherence was measured by MMAS-8; depression, and socioeconomic status were assessed by GDS-SF and Kuppuswamy scales respectively.\nFrom 134 PD subjects, high adherence was observed in 43.2%, 18.2% had moderate, and 38.6% reported low adherence level to their pharmacotherapy. The sub-optimal level of adherence was significantly correlated to compliance of follow up with the physician (p 0.03), presence of adverse events related to drugs (p 0.03), and depressive symptoms (p < 0.0001). Also, there was significant negative co-relationship between poor adherence and depression on Spearman's rank coefficient (0.702). There was no effect of demographic factors, living conditions, family type, educational qualification, associated comorbid conditions, and socioeconomic status on adherence to dopaminergic treatment in patients with PD.\nPoor adherence to prescribed medication is a menace that is more than just oversimplification of forgetfulness which should be evaluated at each visit to improve efficacy of the prescribed regimen to achieve better treatment result and thus quality of life of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder and is marked by inflammation and death of neurons in the striatum region of the midbrain. It has been reported that expression of NF-\u03baB increases during Parkinson's disease, which promotes oxidative stress, stimulates release of proinflammatory cytokines, and induces expression of nitric oxide. Therefore, in this study, we have used mangiferin a specific NF-\u03baB inhibitor. Mangiferin is a polyphenolic compound traditionally used for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\nThe study utilized male Wistar rats weighing 200-250 g (56 rats; \nTreatment with mangiferin significantly improves the key parameters of locomotor activity and oxidative stress and reduces the parameters of inflammatory stress. Also, the activity of caspases was reduced. Significant decrease in activity of both cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 was also observed. Maximum improvement in all parameters was observed in rats treated with grouping of mangiferin 45 \u00b5g/kg and levodopa 10 mg/kg. Treatment with levodopa alone has no significant effect on biochemical and molecular parameters though it significantly improves behavioral parameters.\nCurrent treatment of Parkinson's disease does not target progression of Parkinson's disease. Results of this study suggest that mangiferin has protective effect in hemi-Parkinsonian rats. Therefore, the combination therapy of mangiferin and levodopa can be helpful in management of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized classically by motor manifestations. However, nonmotor symptoms appear early in the course of the disease progression, making both diagnosis and treatment difficult. The pathology of PD is complicated by the accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins in intracellular cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies (LBs). The main toxic component of LBs is the protein \u03b1-Synuclein which plays a pivotal role in PD pathogenesis. \u03b1-Synuclein can propagate from cell-to-cell exhibiting prion-like properties and spread PD pathology throughout the central nervous system. Immunotherapeutic interventions in PD, both active and passive immunization, have targeted \u03b1-Synuclein in both experimental models and clinical trials. In addition, targeting the hyperactive inflammation in PD also holds promise in designing potential immunotherapeutics. The inflammatory and proteotoxic pathways are interlinked and contribute immensely to the disease pathology. In this chapter, we critically review the targets of immunotherapeutic interventions in PD, focusing on the pathogenetic mechanisms of PD, particularly neuroinflammation and \u03b1-Synuclein misfolding, aggregation, and propagation. We thoroughly summarized the various immunotherapeutic strategies designed to treat PD-in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials. The development of these targeted immunotherapies could open a new avenue in the treatment of patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies reported increased plasma levels of cystatin C (Cys-C) in Parkinson's disease (PD) and claimed for a possible association with disease severity and progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate plasma Cys-C in PD and healthy controls (HC) and test its association with markers of peripheral inflammation, neurodegeneration, and clinical progression in a longitudinal study.\nPlasma Cys-C, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were assessed at the baseline in 71 consecutive non-demented PD and 69 HC. PD patients underwent an extensive motor and cognitive assessment at baseline and after 2 years of follow-up. The association of Cys-C with disease severity was evaluated in a multilinear model adjusted for the effect of age, sex, disease duration, and peripheral inflammation.\nCys-C levels appeared to be higher in PD compared to controls and correlated with the plasma neuronal marker NfL (r = 0.204, p = 0.046). In longitudinal analyses, PD patients with higher Cys-C levels exhibited faster motor progression at 2 years of follow-up independently from the peripheral inflammatory profile.\nCys-C was associated with higher NfL levels and a remarkably faster motor progression in PD independently from peripheral inflammation. Further studies are needed in order to understand the mechanisms underpinning the association of Cys-C with higher neuronal damage markers in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "A multimodal connectomic analysis using diffusion and functional MRI can provide complementary information on the structure-function network dynamics involved in complex neurodegenerative network disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Deep learning-based graph neural network models generate higher-level embeddings that could capture intricate structural and functional regional interactions related to PD.\nThis study aimed at investigating the role of structure-function connections in predicting PD, by employing an end-to-end graph attention network (GAT) on multimodal brain connectomes along with an interpretability framework.\nThe proposed GAT model was implemented to generate node embeddings from the structural connectivity matrix and multimodal feature set containing morphological features and structural and functional network features of PD patients and healthy controls. Graph classification was performed by extracting topmost node embeddings, and the interpretability framework was implemented using saliency analysis and attention maps. Moreover, we also compared our model with unimodal models as well as other state-of-the-art models.\nOur proposed GAT model with a multimodal feature set demonstrated superior classification performance over a unimodal feature set.

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is involved in the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders, in particular Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Alterations in the blood-brain barrier may allow peripheral blood lymphocytes to enter the central nervous system; these may participate in disease pathogenesis.\nTo evaluate the peripheral blood lymphocyte profiles of patients with AD and PD and their association with the disease and its progression.\nThe study included 20 patients with AD, 20 with PD, and a group of healthy individuals. Ten of the patients with AD and 12 of those with PD were evaluated a second time 17 to 27 months after the start of the study. Lymphocyte subpopulations and their activation status were determined by flow cytometry. All patients underwent neurological examinations using internationally validated scales.\nCompared to healthy individuals, patients with AD and PD showed significantly higher levels of activated lymphocytes, lymphocytes susceptible to apoptosis, central memory T cells, and regulatory T and B cells. As the diseases progressed, there was a significant decrease in activated cells (CD4+ CD38+ and CD8+ CD38+ in PD and AD, CD4+ CD69+ and CD8+ CD69+ in PD), T cells susceptible to apoptosis, and some regulatory populations (CD19+ CD5+ IL10+ in PD and AD, CD19+ CD5+ IL10+ FoxP3+, CD4+ FoxP3+ CD25+ CD45RO+ in PD). In patients with AD, disease progression was associated with lower percentages of CD4+ CD38+ cells and higher percentages of effector CD4 cells at the beginning of the study. Significant differences were observed between both diseases.\nThis study provides evidence of changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotypes associated with AD and PD and their severity. Considering effective blood-brain communication, our results open new avenues of research into immunomodulation therapies to treat these diseases.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with inferior clinical outcomes after surgical management of many orthopedic conditions. The purpose of this systematic review was to define the clinical, functional, and patient-reported outcomes of shoulder arthroplasty (SA) in patients with PD.\nFollowing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic search was completed using the Ovid platform for searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, and Cochrane Systematic Reviews, with additional searches in Web of Science and Scopus. Included studies were full-length, English-language, clinical investigations reporting on SA in patients with PD with at least one clinical outcome.\nSeven studies including 7126 patients (7134 SA) met inclusion criteria with a mean age of 72.6 (range, 69.5-75.8 years), 58.9% female, and the average follow-up duration was 65 months (range, 17-119 months). Anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) was the most reported implant surgery (n\u00a0=\u00a03455, 48.4%) followed by hemiarthroplasty (HA) (n\u00a0=\u00a02840, 39.8%), and reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) (n\u00a0=\u00a0839,1.8%). SA consistently improved pain. Forward elevation, abduction, and external rotation had a pooled mean increase of 36\u00b0, 20\u00b0, and 6\u00b0, respectively. Complications occurred at a pooled rate of 22.5%, with stiffness (7.1%), need for revision (5.3%), and instability (4.7%) as the most common complications reported. Reoperations inclusive of revisions occurred at a lower pooled rate of 5.6%, with aTSA (n\u00a0=\u00a0201; 9.0%) having the highest rate, followed by HA (n\u00a0=\u00a0158; 7.1%), and then RSA (n\u00a0=\u00a042; 1.9%).\nThe results of the present systematic review demonstrate that SA in patients with PD results in consistent pain relief. However, inferior improvements in clinical outcomes may be expected when compared with patients without PD, likely due to the neurodegenerative manifestations of this disorder. In addition, RSA had a lower reoperation rate than HA and aTSA in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "This study explored the effects of Health Qigong exercise on lower limb motor function in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nA total of 40 patients with PD were recruited and randomly allocated into the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group completed an intervention of Health Qigong exercise over 12 weeks, while the control group did not perform any regular physical activity. Data relating to gait, lower-limb joint range of motion, Timed Up and Go, as well as scores for motor function scale from the Unified Parkinson's Comprehensive Rating Scale III (UPCRS III) before and after the intervention were collected for Repeated Measure ANOVA.\nCompared to the control group, Health Qigong exercise improved the constant- and high-speed stride length and gait velocity of patients, but not constant- and high-speed stride frequency. Left and right hip flexion and extension range were improved as well as left and right knee flexion range. Finally, Timed Up and Go time became significantly slower and UPCRS III score significantly decreased.\nHealth Qigong exercise can improve walking ability and lower limb joint range of motion in patients with PD, lessen motor difficulties, and improve the quality of life. This non-pharmacological exercise intervention may be a useful adjustment treatment for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevailing neurodegenerative disorder. Baicalein has neuroprotective effects on PD animals, but its mechanism is not clarified. We explored baicalein effects on PD rats. PD rat models were established by injecting 6-hydroxydopamine into the striatum of substantia nigra on the left side of the rat brain and treated with baicalein. Dopamine (DA) content, neuronal apoptosis, neuronal injury, neuronal mitochondria, and autophagy were assessed. Baicalein-treated PD rats were treated with autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine to identify the role of autophagy in PD. PD rats were injected with AgomiR-30b-5p or sh-SIRT1 plasmids and treated with baicalein. PD rats elicited decreased neurological score and DA secretion of the striatum, increased neuronal apoptosis, and injury, and reduced number of mitochondria and autophagy, whereas baicalein alleviated neuronal injury and partly recovered mitochondrial dysfunction, 3-methyladenine inhibited the protection of baicalein. miR-30b-5p was elevated and SIRT1 was diminished in PD rats and inhibited by baicalein. miR-30b-5p targeted SIRT1. miR-30b-5p overexpression or SIRT1 silencing annulled the protection of baicalein. The phosphorylation level of AMPK in the substantia nigra of PD rats was decreased and mTOR was increased, whereas baicalein annulled these trends. Briefly, baicalein activated mitochondrial autophagy ",

    "abstract": "CoronaVirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) led to social distancing and the need for alternative care models. Telehealth programs for people with Parkinson's (PWP) disease may ensure continuity of care. The goal of this observational survey study was to determine the practicability, satisfaction, and barriers to online programs, their relationship to perceived symptoms, mood, and quality of life, and program sustainability beyond the immediate pandemic.\nIn-person Parkinson's programs at New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine transitioned online at the start of the pandemic to include Rock Steady Boxing, Support Groups, and Rock Steady Buddies. A custom online survey sent to 150 participants investigated PD history, symptomatology, level of exercise before and during the pandemic, depression (PHQ-9), quality of life (PDQ-39), and practicability and perceived satisfaction related to these online programs. Descriptive statistics were reported.\nOf 69 respondents [mean age of 70.2y (SD 8.4 yrs)], >75% were satisfied with the transition to online programs. Consistent attendance and minimal barriers to programs indicated practicability, with increased adherence to exercise. Of 66 completed PHQ-9s, 22.7% had scores \u22659 (moderate to severe depression); of 61 completed PDQ-39s, scores averaged 21.4; better quality of life than national averages for PWP. Self-perceived physical and mental wellbeing were positively affected.\nResults suggest the transition to online programs met the needs of the Parkinson's community in a practicable and sustainable manner during the pandemic. With COVID-19 still prevalent, the current model of blending synchronous online and in-person classes provides a more flexible, sustainable format compared to in-person alone. Institutions may consider including online components to existing programs to promote continuity of care for aging populations as part of best practices.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by cognitive impairment and functional decline increasing with disease progression. Within non-pharmacological interventions, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) might represent a cost-effective rehabilitation strategy to implement cognitive abilities with positive implications for functional autonomy and quality-of-life of patients. Our systematic review aimed at evaluating the effects of tDCS upon cognition in people suffering from AD and PD. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) into PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Three review authors extracted data of interest, with neuropsychological tests or experimental cognitive tasks scores as outcome measures. A total of 17 RCTs (10 trials for AD and 7 trials for PD) were included. Compared with sham stimulation, tDCS may improve global cognition and recognition memory in patients with AD and also some executive functions (i.e., divided attention, verbal fluency, and reduction of sensitivity to interference) in patients with PD. Criticism remains about benefits for the other investigated cognitive domains. Despite preliminary emerging evidences, larger RCTs with common neuropsychological measures and long-term follow-ups establishing longevity of the observed effects are necessary for future research in applied psychology field, alongside improved clinical guidelines on the neurodegenerative disorders pertaining electrodes montage, sessions number, duration and intensity of the stimulation, and cognitive battery to be used.",

    "abstract": "Dance as a treatment to support physical, cognitive and emotional functioning, has gained increased acceptance as a healthcare intervention for people with Parkinson's Disease (PD). The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been far reaching with devastating effects for at-risk populations. To find alternative and safe treatment delivery options during the pandemic has been of utmost importance. The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to evaluate the feasibility and the experience of digital dance for people with PD (Dance for PD\u00a9) and to examine change in self-reported quality of life, psychological health, subjective cognitive complaints and mental fatigue.\n23 participants with PD (mean age 70) partook in 10-h weekly digital Dance for PD sessions. Feasibility outcome measures were assessed at post-test. Web-based questionnaires examining quality of life, subjective memory complaints, depression, anxiety and mental fatigue were administered at pre- and post-test. Moreover, nine participants partook in focus group discussions at post-test.\nThe results showed an acceptable feasibility to home-based digital Dance for PD, where 86% of the dance classes were completed, only minor negative side effects were reported (i.e., sore joints), and all experienced the dance classes as motivating and safe to do at home. The majority also reported positive effects on mood and physical functioning. The results from the questionnaires showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms (\nThis study showed that digital Dance for PD is feasible and holds promise as a viable and safe method to keep people with PD dancing even when physical meetings are not possible. Beyond the pandemic, digital dance could be applied to a wide variety of patient groups including rural populations and patients for whom transportation may not be feasible for practical or financial reasons.\nRetrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on 25/06/2021 with the following registration number: NCT04942392.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, manifests with motor and non-motor symptoms associated with two main pathological hallmarks, including the deterioration of dopaminergic cells and aggregation of alpha-synuclein. Yet, PD is a neurodegenerative process whose origin is uncertain and progression difficult to monitor and predict. Currently, a possibility is that PD may be secondary to long lasting peripheral affectations. In this regard, it has been shown that retinal degeneration is present in PD patients. Although it is unknown if retinal degeneration precedes PD motor symptoms, the possibility exists since degeneration of peripheral organs (e.g., olfaction, gut) have already been proven to antedate PD motor symptoms. In this paper, we explore this possibility by introducing the anatomical and functional relationship of retina and brain and providing an overview of the physiopathological changes of retinal structure and visual function in PD. On the basis of the current status of visual deficits in individuals with PD, we discuss the modalities and pathological mechanism of visual function or morphological changes in the retina and focus on the correlation between visual impairment and some representative structural features with clinical significance. To consider retinal degeneration as a contributor to PD origin and progress is important because PD evolution may be monitored and predicted by retinal studies through state-of-the-art techniques of the retina. It is significant to integrally understand the role of retinal morphological and functional changes in the neurodegenerative process for the diagnosis and therapeutic strategies of PD.",

    "abstract": "The use of self-tracking of bio-behavioral states along with prescription dosing information is increasingly popular in the care and study of many human diseases. Parkinson's Disease is particularly amenable to such tracking, as patients live with the progressive disease for many years, increasing motivation to pursue quality of life changes through careful monitoring of symptoms and self-guided management of their medications and lifestyle choices. Through the use of digital self-tracking technologies, patients independently or in conjunction with professional medical advice are modulating their medications and behavioral regimens based on self-tracking data. Self-trackers engage in self-experimentation with their health, and more broadly, in personal digital health. This paper briefly depicts notable, recent patient accounts of self-tracking and the uses of digital health in Parkinson's disease: those of Sara Riggare and Kevin Krejci. It also highlights important facets of a previously unreported case: Velva Walden's care as managed jointly by her caregiver son. Key aspects of self-tracking inherent to these cases are examined and potential opportunities to advance personalized medicine through the use of digital health and self-experimentation are outlined.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is widely used for treatment of advanced, medication-refractory Parkinson's disease (PD). However, a significant proportion of patients may suffer adverse effects; up to 10% will present one or more transient or permanent neurobehavioral events.\nIn our case study, a 44-year-old woman diagnosed with PD 6 years previously who was suffering from motor fluctuations, dyskinesia, and freezing of gait episodes was submitted for DBS and implanted with directional electrodes. Intraoperative local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded. After surgery, conventional monopolar revision was performed. Preoperative 3T MRI studies and postoperative 3D and X-ray data were integrated using the Guide DTI software application (Brainlab), and diffusion tensor imaging tractography traced from cortical areas to each subthalamic nucleus (STN) using Elements software (Brainlab).\nWe observed that left STN stimulation in the ring mode significantly improved motor symptoms, but the patient presented uncontrollable mirthful laughter. Stimulation was then switched to the directional mode; laughter remained when using the more posteromedial contact (3-C+) but not 2-C+ or 4-C+ at the same parameters. Interestingly, LFP recordings showed the highest beta-band activity over contacts 4 and 2, and very scarce beta power over contact 3. The orientation of the directional leads was selected based on the 3D postoperative X-rays. Associative fibers showed the shortest distance to contact number 3.\nStimulation of the STN can affect motor and associative loops. The use of directional electrodes is a good option to avoid not only undesirable capsular or lemniscal effects, but also limbic/associative events. Oscillatory activity in the beta range that preferentially takes place over the somatomotor STN region and is closely related to motor improvement, provides a reliable guide for optimizing the DBS programming. The importance of the exact location of electrical stimulation to determine the non-motor symptoms such as mood, apathy, attention, and memory, as well as the usefulness of biological markers such as LFP for optimal programming, is discussed in relation to this case.",

    "results": "We observed that left STN stimulation in the ring mode significantly improved motor symptoms, but the patient presented uncontrollable mirthful laughter. Stimulation was then switched to the directional mode; laughter remained when using the more posteromedial contact (3-C+) but not 2-C+ or 4-C+ at the same parameters. Interestingly, LFP recordings showed the highest beta-band activity over contacts 4 and 2, and very scarce beta power over contact 3. The orientation of the directional leads was selected based on the 3D postoperative X-rays. Associative fibers showed the shortest distance to contact number 3.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait is detrimental to patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Its pathophysiology represents a multilevel failure of motor processing in the cortical, subcortical, and brainstem circuits, ultimately resulting in ineffective motor output of the spinal pattern generator. Electrophysiological studies pointed to abnormalities of oscillatory activity in freezers that covered a broad frequency range including the theta, alpha, and beta bands. We explored muscular frequency domain activity with respect to freezing, and used deep brain stimulation to modulate these rhythms thereby evaluating the supraspinal contributions to spinal motor neuron activity.\nWe analyzed 9 PD freezers and 16 healthy controls (HC). We studied the patients after overnight withdrawal of dopaminergic medication with stimulation off, stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS\nIn stimulation off, PD freezers showed increased muscle activity of the alpha and low-beta band compared to HC in both TA and GA. This activity increase was present during straight walking and during the freezes to similar extent. STN- but not SNr-DBS decreased this activity and paralleled the clinical improvement of freezing.\nWe found increased muscle activation of the alpha and lower beta band in PD freezers compared to HC, and this was attenuated with STN-DBS. Future studies may use combined recordings of local field potentials, electroencephalography (EEG), and electromyography (EMG) to interrogate the supraspinal circuit mechanisms of the pathological activation pattern of the spinal pattern generator.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. To date, no specific treatment to halt disease progression is available, only medication to alleviate symptoms can be prescribed. The main pathological hallmark of PD is the development of neuronal inclusions, positive for \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), which are termed Lewy bodies (LBs) or Lewy neurites. However, the cause of the inclusion formation and the loss of neurons remain largely elusive. Various genetic determinants were reported to be involved in PD etiology, including ",

    "abstract": "Several studies have examined the impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) on the quality of couples' relationships. To date, few studies have explored how couples experience their relationship dynamic by taking into account the disease stage. The objectives of this study were to understand the experience of each partner and to study the mechanisms that underlie their couple organization in the advanced stage of PD.\nSemistructured individual interviews conducted with fifteen patients and their partners were the subject of a dyadic interpretative phenomenological analysis.\nThree themes were identified from the analysis: the first, \"A Closeness That Separates,\" allows the identification of different patterns of interactions that lead to emotional distancing between the partners; the second, \"The Adversity Is Not Unbearable, But Going It Alone Would Be,\" emphasizes the importance of how the assisting partner provides support; and the third, \"Be Prepared for Anything and Facing an Uncertain Future,\" reveals the extent and modes of the dyadic regulation of the emotions linked to what the future may hold.\nPsychological support is important to help couples express both their feelings and their respective needs in the evolving context of PD.",

    "abstract": "The Uniform Data Set 3.0 neuropsychological battery (UDS3NB) is well developed for research with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, and may serve as a common set of measures of cognitive decline across neurodegenerative diseases. However, the battery has not been formally assessed in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). The current research provides initial information on the convergent and ecological validity of the UDS3NB in individuals with PD.\nParticipants included 75 individuals diagnosed with PD from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders. Clinical dementia ratings, administered independently from the cognitive measures, identified individuals as having normal cognition (\nAt the group-level, UDS3NB scores followed the expected pattern with higher scores in participants with PD but no cognitive diagnosis and lower in those with dementia; scores in the MCI group were between these extremes. Convergent validity was suggested by moderate correlations between UDS specific measures (i.e., Craft story) and measures such as the RAVLT. Ecological validity was suggested by statistically significant correlations between UDS3NB performance and caregiver ratings of ADLs, with speed and executive functioning measures (Trailmaking A; \nFindings provide initial support for the convergent and ecological validity of the UDS3NB in individuals with PD. Implications and future directions for this battery are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by loss of neurons that synthesize dopamine, and subsequent impaired movement. Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) exerted neuroprotection effects in a rodent model of PD. However, the mechanism underlying UC-MSC-generated neuroprotection was not fully elucidated. In the present study, we found that intranasal administration of UC-MSCs significantly alleviated locomotor deficits and rescued dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting neuroinflammation in a PD mouse model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, a toxic agent which selectively destroys nigrostriatal neurons but does not affect dopaminergic neurons elsewhere). Furthermore, UC-MSC treatment altered gut microbiota composition characterized by decreased phylum Proteobacteria, class Gammaproteobacteria, family Enterobacteriaceae, and genus ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder caused by decreasing dopamine in the brain. Speech is one of the first functions that are disrupted. Accordingly, speech features are a promising indicator in PD diagnosis for telemedicine applications. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of Parkinson's disease on a minimal set of Jitter and Shimmer voice indicators and studying the difference between male and female speech features in noisy/noiseless environments.\nOur data includes 47 samples from nursing homes and neurology clinics, with 23 patients and 24 healthy individuals. The optimal feature for each category is studied separately for the men's and women's samples. The focus here is on the phonation in which the vowel/a/is expressed by the participants. The main features, including Jitter and Shimmer perturbations, are extracted. To find an optimal pair under both noisy and noiseless circumstance, we use the Relief feature selection strategy.\nThis research shows that the Jitter feature for men and women with Parkinson's is 21 and 33.4, respectively. While the Shimmer feature is 0.1 and 0.06. In addition, by using these two features alone, we reach a correct diagnosis rate of 79% and 81% for noisy and noiseless states, respectively.\nThe PD effects on the speech features can be accurately identified. Evaluating the extracted features suggests that the absolute value of the selected feature in men with PD is higher than for healthy ones. Whereas, in the case of women, this is the opposite.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that subthalamic nucleus (STN) and unilateral globus pallidus interna (GPi) are similarly effective in the deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment of motor symptoms. However, the counterintuitively more common clinical application of STN DBS makes us hypothesize that STN is superior to GPi in the treatment of motor symptoms.\nIn this prospective, double-blind, randomized crossover study, idiopathic PD patients treated with combined unilateral STN and contralateral GPi DBS (STN in one brain hemisphere and GPi in the other) for 2 to 3 years were enrolled. The MDS UPDRS-III total score and subscale scores for axial and bilateral limb symptoms were assessed preoperatively and at 2- to 3-year follow-up in four randomized, double-blinded conditions: (1) Med-STN+GPi-, (2) Med-STN-GPi+, (3) Med+STN+GPi-, and (4) Med+STN-GPi+.\nEight patients had completed 30 trials of assessment. Compared with the preoperative Med- state, in the Med-STN+GPi- condition, the cardinal symptoms in both sides of the body were all improved. In the Med-STN-GPi+ condition, symptoms of the GPi-stim limb were improved, while only tremor was improved on the ipsilateral side, although all axial symptoms showed aggravation. Compared with the preoperative Med+ state, in the Med+STN+GPi- state, cardinal symptoms were improved on both sides, except that tremor was worsened on the STN-stim side. In the Med+STN-GPi+ state, the overall motor symptoms were aggravated compared with the preoperative Med+ state. Most axial symptoms worsened at acute unilateral STN or GPi DBS onset, compared to both preoperative Med- and Med+ states. No side effects associated with this study were seen.\nImprovement in motor symptoms was greater in all sub-scores favoring STN. The effects of STN+ were seen on both sides of the body, while GPi+ mainly acted on the contralateral side.",

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal pain is commonly experienced in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Few studies have investigated the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with musculoskeletal pain.\nTo investigate the distribution, clinical characteristics, and factors associated with musculoskeletal pain in a large sample of patients with PD.\nWe enrolled 452 patients from two clinics and used a standardized questionnaire to collect demographic and clinical information. Musculoskeletal pain was diagnosed based on the Ford Classification System, and pain severity was assessed with the numeric rating scale (NRS). Multivariate regression models explored the association between clinical features of PD and quality of life and pain.\nTwo hundred and six patients (45.58%) reported musculoskeletal pain, typically in their lower limbs and backs. Levodopa resulted in a \u226530% reduction in pain intensity scores in 170 subjects. Female sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.57; 95% CI, 1.07-2.29) and Levodopa-equivalent daily doses (LEDDs; OR, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.63-6.59) were associated with an increased risk for musculoskeletal pain. Pain duration (\nThe lower limbs and back are common sites of musculoskeletal pain in patients with PD, and up to 82.52% of patients were responsive to Levodopa. Female sex and LEDDs are associated with musculoskeletal pain, suggesting that dopamine deficiencies, and not the motor and non-motor impairment, might be the most critical baseline risk factor of musculoskeletal pain.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the second primary neurodegenerative disease affecting human health, is mainly characterized by dopaminergic neuron damage in the midbrain and the clinical manifestation of movement disorders. Studies have shown that neuroinflammation plays an important role in the progression of PD. Excessively activated microglia produce several pro-inflammatory mediators, leading to damage to the surrounding neurons and finally inducing neurodegeneration. Echinocystic acid (EA) exhibits an anti-inflammatory effect in peripheral tissues. However, whether it inhibited neuroinflammation remains unclear. Therefore, the current study investigates the effect of EA on neuroinflammation and whether it can improve PD symptoms through inhibiting neuroinflammation. In our experiments, we discovered that EA inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in LPS-exposed BV2 cells. Further mechanism-related studies revealed that EA inhibited inflammation by activating PI3K/Akt and inhibiting NF-\u03baB and MAPK signal pathways in LPS-induced BV2 cells. Research revealed that EA eases microglia-mediated neuron death in SN4741 and SHSY5Y cells. In ",

    "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the clinical characteristics of PD psychosis (PDP) have been rarely reported in Chinese PD patients. We aimed to categorize PDP in a PD cohort and its relationship to other clinical characteristics.\nA total of 149 Chinese PD patients were consecutively enrolled, and idiopathic PD patients were recruited in the study. The symptoms of PDP were assessed with the enhanced Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms in PD. Then, the patients were classified into a PD-control group, isolated minor hallucination (MH) group, and complex MH group, and clinical and demographic data of different groups were compared.\nParkinson's disease psychosis was present in 40.3% (60/149) of our patients. The most common PDPs were MHs, present in 32.9% (49 of 149) of the cohort. Compared to patients without MHs, patients with MHs were older, had a longer disease duration, a higher levodopa equivalent daily dose, more severe motor symptoms, dyskinesia, a higher rate of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders, frontal lobe function impairments, and a higher percentage of cognitive impairment. Logistic regression analysis showed that advanced Hoehn-Yahr stage [odds ratio (OR): 2.697, \nMHs were frequent non-motor symptoms in PD patients. It was associated with increased motor and non-motor symptom burdens and reduced quality of life. MHs have been called \"minor,\" but they have major clinical and prognostic implications and need early screening.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the leading causes of dementia. These neurological disorders are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins such as amyloid-\u00df (A\u00df), tau protein and \u03b1-synuclein, contributing to mitochondrial fragmentation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Misfolded proteins activate microglia, which induces neuroinflammation, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequently facilitates synaptic damage and neuronal loss. So far, all the proposed drugs were based on the inhibition of protein aggregation and were failed in clinical trials. Therefore, the treatment options of dementia are still a challenging issue. Thus, it is worthwhile to study alternative therapeutic strategies. In this context, there is increasing data on the pivotal role of transcription factor NF- E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) on the redox homeostasis and anti-inflammatory functions in neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, Nrf2 signaling pathway has shown upregulation of antioxidant genes, inhibition of microglia-mediated inflammation, and improved mitochondrial function in neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting Nrf2 activation could be a novel therapeutic approach to target pathogenesis. The present review will examine the correlation between Nrf2 signaling with neuroinflammation in AD and PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a clinically common neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Microglia (MG), as an innate immune cell in the CNS, are involved in a variety of immunity and inflammatory responses in the CNS. A number of studies have shown that the overactivation of MG is one of the critical pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PD. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are considered to be an important class of gene expression regulators and are involved in a variety of physiological and pathological mechanisms, including immunity and inflammation. In addition, miRNAs can affect the progress of PD by regulating the expression of various MG genes and the polarization state of the MG. Here, we summarize recent articles and describe the important role of MG pathological polarization in the progression of PD, the diverse mechanisms responsible for how miRNAs regulate MG, and the potential therapeutic prospects of miRNAs for PD. We also propose that the regulation of miRNAs may be a novel protective approach against the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) protein in neurons is a renowned pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, accumulating evidence indicates that activated inflammatory responses are involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Thus, achieving a better understanding of the interaction between inflammation and synucleinopathy in relation to the PD process will facilitate the development of promising disease-modifying therapies. In this review, the evidence of inflammation in PD is discussed, and human, animal, and laboratory studies relevant to the relationship between inflammation and \u03b1Syn are explored as well as new therapeutic targets associated with this relationship.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the risk of occurrence of Parkinson's disease (PD) among subjects with type 2 diabetes and diabetic retinopathy (DR) in our large primary health care database from Catalonia (Spain). A retrospective cohort study with pseudo-anonymized routinely collected health data from SIDIAP was conducted from 2008 to 2016. We calculated the number of events, time to event, cumulative incidence, and incidence rates of PD for subjects with and without DR and for different stages of DR. The proportional hazards regression analysis was done to assess the probability of occurrence between DR and PD. In total, 26,453 type 2 diabetic subjects with DR were identified in the database, and 216,250 subjects without DR at inclusion. During the follow-up period, 1,748 PD events occurred. PD incidence rate and cumulative incidence were higher among subjects with DR (16.95 per 10,000 person-years and 0.83%, respectively). In the unadjusted analysis, subjects with DR were at 1.25 times higher risk (hazard ratio: 1.22, 95% confidence interval: 1.06; 1.41) of developing PD during the study period. However, we did not find any statistically significant HR for DR in any models after adjusting for different risk factors (age, sex, duration of diabetes, smoking, body mass index, glycosylated hemoglobin, comorbidities). In conclusion, in our primary health care population database, DR was not associated with an increased risk of PD after adjusting for different risk factors. In our retrospective cohort study, age, male sex, and diabetes duration were independent risk factors for developing PD.",

    "abstract": "Acceptance of disability (AOD) is a process that a patient must undergo to cope with altered abilities, but its effect in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. The present study aimed to determine the level of AOD, examine the influence of sociodemographic variables and disease characteristics on the AOD level, and evaluate the relation between AOD level and quality of life in a cohort of PD patients from Southwest of China.\nA total of 336 PD patients were consecutively recruited from November 2018 to October 2020. At enrollment, demographic and clinical data were obtained using a questionnaire, and the Acceptance of Disability Scale-Revised (AODS-R) scale was used to measure the AOD level.\nThe mean total score of AOD is 87.28, indicating a moderate level of disability acceptance in PD patients. Statistical analysis showed that understanding of PD, family support, and UPDRS-II score were major factors affecting AOD level, and patients with low AOD levels were more likely to have poorer quality of life.\nAOD is a serious problem in PD patients in Southwest China, especially among individuals with insufficient family support and a lack of recognition of the disease. AOD was also associated with motor function and daily living ability, thus suggesting that evaluation of the AOD and promotion of the awareness may be helpful to improve the quality of life in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) have demonstrated in the last decades to determine an important clinical improvement in advanced and selected Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, only a minority of parkinsonian patients meet the criteria to undergo DBS, and the surgical procedure itself is often stressful, especially for patients experiencing severe OFF state. Subcutaneous Apomorphine continuous administration is suitable as an adjunctive therapy capable of improving a suboptimal DBS result. Here we hypothesize a possible role for subcutaneous apomorphine infusion to alleviate severe OFF state in parkinsonian patients undergoing DBS, thus allowing intraoperative microrecording and patient's collaboration during clinical testing.\nA 68-year-old man, suffering from a very long PD-history, characterized by a severe akinetic status and dramatic non-motor features while in OFF, underwent Subthalamic-DBS keeping a slight but continuous apomorphine infusion (1.8\u2009mg/hour), able to guarantee the right degree of patient's collaboration without interfering with microelectrode recordings. There were no intra or perioperative complications and after the procedure he experienced a marked clinical benefit, being able to stop apomorphine administration.\nHere we described the first Subthalamic DBS procedure performed with a low and stable dopaminergic stimulation guaranteed by subcutaneous Apomorphine continuous infusion. For its rapidity of action and prompt reversibility, apomorphine could be particularly suitable for use during difficult surgical procedures in PD, allowing more therapeutic opportunities for patients who would otherwise be excluded from the DBS option.",

    "abstract": "Precise recognition of early Parkinson's disease (PD) has always been a challenging task requiring more feasible biomarkers to be integrated to improve diagnostic accuracy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are believed to be potential and promising candidate biomarkers for PD. However, the role of altered miRNAs of CSF play in PD is unclear. Here, we recruited patients with early stages of PD and controls to analyze the expression of miRNA in CSF by the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Furthermore, we tested the levels of these miRNA in SH-SY5Y cells treated with MPP",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) increases as the population ages. Studies have shown that some cardiometabolic comorbidities could be associated with risk or protection against developing PD. A retrospective case-control study was carried out to analyze the relationship between PD and cardiometabolic comorbidities.\nSubjects with PD and controls without PD were consecutively recruited. Data on type 2 diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension (SAH), dyslipidemia and body mass index were collected. Logistic regression analyses were carried out.\nA total of 781 subjects with PD (56.5% males) and 1,000 controls (44.4% males) were included. After adjusting for age and gender, SAH was found as an independent risk factor (OR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.05-1.67; p = 0.02), and obesity as a protective factor (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.56-0.93; p = 0.01).\nSubjects with SAH had a higher risk of having PD, while obese subjects had a lower risk of having PD. The relationship between cardiometabolic disease, its treatment, and PD etiopathogenesis appears to be extremely complex given the amount of contradictory data.\nLa prevalencia de la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) aumenta a medida que la poblaci\u00f3n envejece.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease and affects about 1% of the population over the age of 60 years in industrialised countries. The aim of this review is to examine nutrition in PD across three domains: dietary intake and the development of PD; whole body metabolism in PD and the effects of PD symptoms and treatment on nutritional status. In most cases, PD is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors and although there has been much research in the area, evidence suggests that poor dietary intake is not a risk factor for the development of PD. The evidence about body weight changes in both the prodromal and symptomatic phases of PD is inconclusive and is confounded by many factors. Malnutrition in PD has been documented as has sarcopaenia, although the prevalence of the latter remains uncertain due to a lack of consensus in the definition of sarcopaenia. PD symptoms, including those which are gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal, are known to adversely affect nutritional status. Similarly, PD treatments can cause nausea, vomiting and constipation, all of which can adversely affect nutritional status. Given that the prevalence of PD will increase as the population ages, it is important to understand the interplay between PD, comorbidities and nutritional status. Further research may contribute to the development of interventional strategies to improve symptoms, augment care and importantly, enhance the quality of life for patients living with this complex neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "Camptocormia is a complication in which the spine bends forward while walking or standing. This axial postural deformity is common in Parkinson's disease (PD), with prevalence ranging from 3 to 18 percent; it is generally associated with a more severe disease and longer duration of symptoms. Camptocormia in PD typically responds poorly to levodopa. Other treatment options are limited and are often not effective.\nWe describe an unusual case of PD presenting with camptocormia that only emerged during the \"off\" state of PD. The patient was treated with classical dopaminergic anti-Parkinson's therapy plus a new formulation of palmitoylethanolamide co-ultramicronized with luteolin (Lut) termed um-PEALut. We observed that the addition of um-PEALut to acute treatment with carbidopa/levodopa resulted in improved dyskinesia and reduced camptocormia. The patient continued treatment for four months, resulting in a complete resolution of leg and trunk dyskinesia and a marked reduction in the onset of camptocormia during the \"off\" states.\num-PEALut shows potential as an efficacious adjuvant therapy for patients with PD receiving carbidopa/levodopa to treat both dyskinesia and camptocormia in acute and chronic fashion.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance-guided high-intensity Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) for tremor has increasingly gained interest as a new non-invasive alternative to standard neurosurgery. Resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) correlates of MRgFUS have not been extensively investigated yet. A region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI rs-FC MRI \"connectomic\" analysis focusing on brain regions relevant for tremor was conducted on 15 tremor-dominant patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent MRgFUS. We tested whether rs-FC between tremor-related areas was modulated by MRgFUS at 1 and 3 months post-operatively, and whether such changes correlated with individual clinical outcomes assessed by the MDS-UPDRS-III sub items for tremor. Significant increase in FC was detected within bilateral primary motor (M1) cortices, as well as between bilateral M1 and crossed primary somatosensory cortices, and also between pallidum and the dentate nucleus of the untreated hemisphere. Correlation between disease duration and FC increase at 3 months was found between the putamen of both cerebral hemispheres and the Lobe VI of both cerebellar hemispheres, as well as between the Lobe VI of untreated cerebellar hemisphere with bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA). Drop-points value of MDS-UPDRS at 3 months correlated with post-treatment decrease in FC, between the anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral SMA, as well as between the Lobe VI of treated cerebellar hemisphere and the interpositus nucleus of untreated cerebellum. Tremor improvement at 3 months, expressed as percentage of intra-subject MDS-UPDRS changes, correlated with FC decrease between bilateral occipital fusiform gyrus and crossed Lobe VI and Vermis VI. Good responders (\u226550% of baseline tremor improvement) showed reduced FC between bilateral SMA, between the interpositus nucleus of untreated cerebellum and the Lobe VI of treated cerebellum, as well as between the untreated SMA and the contralateral putamen. Good responders were characterized at baseline by crossed hypoconnectivity between bilateral putamen and M1, as well as between the putamen of the treated hemisphere and the contralateral SMA. We conclude that MRgFUS can effectively modulate brain FC within the tremor network. Such changes are associated with clinical outcome. The shifting mode of integration among the constituents of this network is, therefore, susceptible to external redirection despite the chronic nature of PD.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) delivered via multicontact leads implanted in the basal ganglia is an established therapy to treat Parkinson disease (PD). However, the different neural circuits that can be modulated through stimulation on different DBS contacts are poorly understood. Evidence shows that electrically stimulating the subthalamic nucleus (STN) causes a therapeutic effect through antidromic activation of the hyperdirect pathway-a monosynaptic connection from the cortex to the STN. Recent studies suggest that stimulating the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) may improve gait. The advent of directional DBS leads now provides a spatially precise means to probe these neural circuits and better understand how DBS affects distinct neural networks.\nWe measured cortical evoked potentials (EPs) using electroencephalography (EEG) in response to low-frequency DBS using the different directional DBS contacts in eight patients with PD.\nA short-latency EP at 3 milliseconds originating from the primary motor cortex appeared largest in amplitude when stimulating DBS contacts closest to the dorsolateral STN (p\u00a0< 0.001). A long-latency EP at 10 milliseconds originating from the premotor cortex appeared strongest for DBS contacts closest to the SNr (p\u00a0< 0.0001).\nOur results show that at the individual patient level, electrical stimulation of different nuclei produces distinct EP signatures. Our approach could be used to identify the functional location of each DBS contact and thus help patient-specific DBS programming.\nThe ClinicalTrials.gov registration number for the study is NCT04658641.",

    "abstract": "External visual cueing is a well-known means to target freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease patients. Holocue is a wearable visual cueing application that allows the HoloLens 1 mixed-reality headset to present on-demand patient-tailored action-relevant 2D and 3D holographic visual cues in free-living environments. The aim of this study involving 24 Parkinson's disease patients with dopaminergic \"ON state\" FOG was two-fold. First, to explore unfamiliarity and habituation effects associated with wearing the HoloLens on FOG. Second, to evaluate the potential immediate effect of Holocue on alleviating FOG in the home environment. Three sessions were conducted to examine (1) the effect of wearing the unfamiliar HoloLens on FOG by comparing walking with and without the HoloLens, (2) habituation effects to wearing the HoloLens by comparing FOG while walking with HoloLens over sessions, and (3) the potential immediate effect of Holocue on FOG by comparing walking with HoloLens with and without Holocue. Wearing the HoloLens (without Holocue) did significantly increase the number and duration of FOG episodes, but this unfamiliarity effect disappeared with habituation over sessions. This not only emphasizes the need for sufficient habituation to unfamiliar devices, but also testifies to the need for research designs with appropriate control conditions when examining effects of unfamiliar wearable cueing devices. Holocue had overall no immediate effect on FOG, although objective and subjective benefits were observed for some individuals, most notably those with long and/or many FOG episodes. Our participants raised valuable opportunities to improve Holocue and confirmed our assumptions about current and anticipated future design choices, which supports ongoing Holocue development for and with end users.",

    "abstract": "Speech changes occur in the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) and cause communication difficulties, leading to social isolation. Lee Silverman voice treatment (LSVT) is a speech therapy approach designed to improve patients' language and voice capabilities.\nThe effectiveness of the LSVT was compared with that of other speech interventions or no treatment to evaluate PD patients with dysarthria.\nSystematic review with meta-analysis of randomized trials. \nAbstracts were screened and reviewed against the eligibility criteria (intervention group participants were PD assessed based on LSVT (LSVT Loud) and randomized control).\nTen randomized controlled trials were identified on speech symptoms in patients with PD. Compared with the respiratory therapy (RET) exercise, or no training group, a significant improvement was detected in the sound press level (SPL) after immediate treatment during the reading of vowel and rainbow passages and an increase in semitone standard deviation (STSD). Furthermore, the LSVT training significantly increased the participants' scores on unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS-III) and speech intelligibility.\nThis meta-analysis demonstrated the efficacy of LSVT in increasing vocal loudness and functional communication among individuals with PD. However, most studies included participants with mild-moderate PD. Thus, additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with large sample sizes are needed to validate the efficacy of LSVT in patients with different progressions of PD, including severe PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder following Alzheimer's disease. Advanced stages of PD, 4 or 5 of the Hoehn and Yahr Scale, are characterized by severe motor complications, limited mobility without assistance, risk of falling, and non-motor complications. The aim of this review was to provide a practical overview on specific artificial intelligence (AI) systems for the management of advanced stages of PD, as well as relevant technological limitations. The authors conducted a systematic search on PubMed and EMBASE with predefined keywords searching for studies published until December 2020. Full articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria were included in the systematic review. To minimize results bias, the reference list was manually searched for pertinent articles to identify any additional relevant missed publications. Exclusion criteria included the following: Other stages of PD than 4 and 5 of the Hoehn and Yahr Scale, case reports, reviews, practice guidelines, commentaries, opinions, letters, editorials, short surveys, articles in press, conference abstracts, conference papers, and abstracts published without a full article. The search identified 21 studies analyzing AI-based applications and robotic systems used for the management of advanced stages of PD, out of which 6 articles analyzed AI-based applications for autonomous management of pharmacologic therapy, 5 articles analyzed home-based telemedicine systems and 10 articles analysed robot-assisted gait training systems. The authors identified significant evidence demonstrating that current AI-based technologies are feasible for automatic management of patients with advanced stages of PD. Improving the quality of care and reducing the cost for patients and healthcare systems are the most important advantages.",

    "abstract": "Treadmill training with virtual reality (TT + VR) has been shown to improve gait performance and to reduce fall risk in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there is no consensus on the optimal training duration. This study is a sub-study of the V-TIME randomized clinical trial (NCT01732653). In this study, we explored the effect of the duration of training based on the motor-cognitive interaction on motor and cognitive performance and on fall risk in subjects with PD. Patients in Hoehn and Yahr stages II-III, aged between 40 and 70 years, were included. In total, 96 patients with PD were assigned to 6 or 12 weeks of TT + VR intervention, and 77 patients completed the full protocol. Outcome measures for gait and cognitive performance were assessed at baseline, immediately after training, and at 1- and 6-month follow-up. The incident rate of falls in the 6-month pre-intervention was compared with that in the 6-month post-intervention. Dual-task gait performance (gait speed, gait speed variability and stride length under cognitive dual task and obstacle negotiation, and the leading foot clearance in obstacle negotiation) improved similarly in both groups with gains sustained at 6-month follow-up. A higher decrease in fall rate and fear of falling were observed in participants assigned to the 12-week intervention than the 6-week intervention. Improvements in cognitive functions (i.e., executive functions, visuospatial ability, and attention) were seen only in participants enrolled in 12-week training up to 1-month follow-up but vanished at the 6-month evaluation. Our results suggest that a longer TT + VR training leads to greater improvements in cognitive functions especially those directly addressed by the virtual environment.",

    "abstract": "Patients requiring deep brain stimulation due to intracerebral metallic foreign substances have not been reported elsewhere in the world. Additionally, the long-term effects of metallic foreign bodies on deep brain stimulation (DBS) are unknown. A 79-year-old man with a 5-year history of Parkinson's disease (PD) reported that, 40 years ago, while playing with a pistol, a metallic bullet was accidentally discharged into the left brain through the edge of the left eye, causing no discomfort other than blurry vision in the left eye. DBS was performed due to the short duration of efficacy for oral medication. Because the bullet was on the left subthalamic nucleus (STN) electrode trajectory and the patient's right limb was primarily stiff, the patient received globus pallidus interna (GPi)-DBS implantation in the left hemisphere and STN-DBS implantation in the right hemisphere. During a 6-month postoperative follow-up, the patient's PD symptoms were effectively managed with no noticeable discomfort.",

    "abstract": "The 5-2-1 criteria (\u22655 levodopa doses/day, \u22652\u00a0h OFF/day, and\u00a0\u2265\u00a01-hour dyskinesia/day) propose to identify people with Parkinson's disease (PD) who are poorly controlled on oral therapies and who may therefore benefit from device-aided therapies. Amantadine-DR/ER is the only medication FDA-approved for both dyskinesia and OFF episodes in levodopa-treated patients. In this \nWeek-12 treatment differences (Amantadine-DR/ER\u00a0-\u00a0placebo) in the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) and PD motor states (patient diaries) were evaluated in pooled, phase-3, double-blind trial participants meeting 5-2-1 criteria at baseline. This 5-2-1 cohort was followed into a 2-year open-label trial, where Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rate Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part IV scores were assessed relative to double-blind baseline.\nOf 198 enrolled participants in the phase 3 trials, 65 (33%; n\u00a0=\u00a029 placebo; n\u00a0=\u00a036 amantadine-DR/ER) comprised the 5-2-1 cohort. At Week-12 endpoint, amantadine-DR/ER significantly improved UDysRS scores (treatment difference of 9.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.15 points, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and ON time without troublesome dyskinesia ('good ON', treatment difference of 2.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.90\u00a0h/day, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Improvements in good ON time resulted from significant reductions in both troublesome dyskinesia and OFF time. Treatment benefit on MDS-UPDRS-Part IV was sustained through open-label, follow-up. The most common adverse events in patients who met 5-2-1 criteria and were treated with amantadine-DR/ER included falls and peripheral edema.\nFindings suggest Amantadine-DR/ER should be considered as an option for people with PD who meet 5-2-1 criteria.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive disease that affects movement, is related to dopaminergic neuron degeneration. Tc-99m Trodat-1 brain (TRODAT) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) aids the functional imaging of dopamine transporters and is used for dopaminergic neuron enumeration. Herein, we employed a convolutional neural network to facilitate PD diagnosis through TRODAT SPECT, which is simpler than models such as VGG16 and ResNet50. We retrospectively collected the data of 3188 patients (age range 20-107 years) who underwent TRODAT SPECT between June 2011 and December 2019. We developed a set of functional imaging multiclassification deep learning algorithms suitable for TRODAT SPECT on the basis of the annotations of medical experts. We then applied our self-proposed model and compared its results with those of four other models, including deep and machine learning models. TRODAT SPECT included three images collected from each patient: one presenting the maximum absorption of the metabolic function of the striatum and two adjacent images. An expert physician determined that our model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were 0.98, 0.98, 0.98, and 0.98, respectively. Our TRODAT SPECT model provides an objective, more standardized classification correlating to the severity of PD-related diseases, thereby facilitating clinical diagnosis and preventing observer bias.",

    "abstract": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are difficult to differentiate especially in the early stages. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index (MRPI) in differentiating PSP from PD. A systematic literature search of PubMed-MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify original articles evaluating the diagnostic performance of the MRPI in differentiating PSP from PD published up to 20 February 2021. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and 95% CI were calculated using the bivariate random-effects model. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model. Meta-regression was performed to explain the effects of heterogeneity. A total of 14 original articles involving 484 PSP patients and 1243 PD patients were included. In all studies, T1-weighted images were used to calculate the MRPI. Among the 14 studies, nine studies used 3D T1-weighted images. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for the diagnostic performance of the MRPI in differentiating PSP from PD were 96% (95% CI, 87-99%) and 98% (95% CI, 91-100%), respectively. The area under the HSROC curve was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98-1.00). Heterogeneity was present (sensitivity: I",

    "abstract": "The Care4PD study examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care situation of people (PwP) with Parkinson's disease in Germany. A comprehensive, nationwide, anonymous questionnaire for PwP was distributed by the members' journal of the German Parkinson's Disease Association and in several PD specialized in- and outpatient institutions. PwP subjectively evaluated their general care situation and individual impairments during the pandemic. We analyzed 1269 eligible out of 1437 returned questionnaires (88.3%) and compared PwP with (p-LTC) and without (np-LTC) professional long-term care. Both groups rated the general pandemic-related consequences as being rather mild to moderate (e.g., worsening of symptom or concerns). However, familial/social contact restrictions were indicated as most compromising, whereas access to outpatient professional health care providers was less affected. PwP with professional LTC reported more impairment than those without. COVID-19 vaccination rates and acceptance were generally high (p-LTC: 64.3%, np-LTC: 52.3%) at the time of the study, but realization of sanitary measures-especially wearing masks as a patient during care sessions-still needs to be improved. Technical options for telemedicine were principally available but only rarely used. Altogether, during the COVID-19 pandemic, PwP in Germany seemed to have a relatively stable health care access, at least in outpatient settings, while mainly social isolation compromised them. The p-LTC group was more impaired in everyday live compared with the np-LTC group.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic causes increased mental stress and decreased mobility, which may affect people with Parkinson's disease (PD). The study aimed to investigate the secondary impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the level of activity, quality of life (QoL) and PD-related symptoms. The respondents completed an online survey in Polish in the period from December, 2020 to June, 2021. The questionnaire was completed by 47 participants aged 43 to 90 years (mean 72.1 \u00b1 1.3 years). A total of 94% reported reduced contact with family and friends. Over 90% remained active during the pandemic. However, 55% of people with PD showed subjectively lower level of activity then before the pandemic. Moreover, 36% of the respondents felt afraid to visit a doctor and reported problems with access to medication. Subjective QoL reduction was reported by 80%, and 83% declared worsening of PD symptoms. The post pandemic deterioration of motor symptoms in people with PD did not affect their QoL. However, the deterioration of contacts and feelings of isolation had a significant impact on the decline in quality of life (",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms by suppressing neuropathological oscillations. These oscillations are also modulated by inhalational anesthetics used during DBS surgery in some patients, influencing electrode placement accuracy. We sought to evaluate a method that could avoid these effects. We recorded subthalamic nucleus (STN) neuronal firings in 11 PD patients undergoing DBS under inhalational anesthesia. Microelectrode recording (MER) during DBS was collected under median nerve stimulation (MNS) delivered at 5, 20, and 90 Hz frequencies and without MNS. We analyzed the spike firing rate and neuronal activity with power spectral density (PSD), and assessed correlations between the neuronal oscillation parameters and clinical motor outcomes. No patient experienced adverse effects during or after DBS surgery. PSD analysis revealed that peripheral 20 Hz MNS produced significant differences in the dorsal and ventral subthalamic nucleus (STN) between the beta band oscillation (16.9 \u00b1 7.0% versus 13.5 \u00b1 4.8%, respectively) and gamma band oscillation (56.0 \u00b1 13.7% versus 66.3 \u00b1 9.4%, respectively) (",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease, leading to motor and non-motor complications. Autonomic alterations, including gastrointestinal symptoms, precede motor defects and act as early warning signs. Chronic exposure to dietary, environmental heavy metals impacts the gastrointestinal system and host-associated microbiome, eventually affecting the central nervous system. The correlation between dysbiosis and PD suggests a functional and bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain. The bioaccumulation of metals promotes stress mechanisms by increasing reactive oxygen species, likely altering the bidirectional gut-brain link. To better understand the differing molecular mechanisms underlying PD, integrative modeling approaches are necessary to connect multifactorial perturbations in this heterogeneous disorder. By exploring the effects of gut microbiota modulation on dietary heavy metal exposure in relation to PD onset, the modification of the host-associated microbiome to mitigate neurological stress may be a future treatment option against neurodegeneration through bioremediation. The progressive movement towards a systems toxicology framework for precision medicine can uncover molecular mechanisms underlying PD onset such as metal regulation and microbial community interactions by developing predictive models to better understand PD etiology to identify options for novel treatments and beyond. Several methodologies recently addressed the complexity of this interaction from different perspectives; however, to date, a comprehensive review of these approaches is still lacking. Therefore, our main aim through this manuscript is to fill this gap in the scientific literature by reviewing recently published papers to address the surrounding questions regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms between metals, microbiota, and the gut-brain-axis, as well as the regulation of this system to prevent neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a widespread neuronal degenerative disorder with unexplored etiology. It is associated with various pathological events. In particular, the prefrontal cortex Brodmann area 9 (BA9) region is affected in PD. This frontal lobe brain region plays an important role in cognitive, motor, and memory-related functions. BA9 develops Lewy bodies in PD patients and shows essential changes in transcriptome and proteome, connected with mitochondria related pathways, protein folding pathways, and metallothioneins. Recently, altered adenosine to inosine mRNA editing patterns have been detected in various neurological pathologies. In this article, we present an investigation of differences in A-to-I RNA editing levels and specificity of mRNA editing sites in brain tissues of healthy and PD patients based on RNA sequencing data. Overall, decreased editing levels in the brains of PD patients were observed, potential editing sites with altered editing during PD were identified, and the role of different adenosine deaminases in this process was analyzed.",

    "abstract": "Mannitol, a natural alcoholic-sugar, was recently suggested as a potential disease-modifying agent in Parkinson's disease. In animal models of the disease, mannitol interferes with the formation of \u03b1-synuclein fibrils, inhibits the formation of \u03b1-synuclein oligomers and leads to phenotypic recovery of impaired motor functions. Parkinson's patients who consume mannitol report improvements of both motor and non-motor symptoms. Safety of long-term use of oral mannitol, tolerable dose and possible benefit, however, were never clinically studied. We studied the safety of oral mannitol in Parkinson's disease and assessed the maximal tolerable oral dose by conducting a phase IIa, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, dose-escalating study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03823638). The study lasted 36 weeks and included four dose escalations of oral mannitol or dextrose to a maximal dose of 18 g per day. The primary outcome was the safety of oral mannitol, as assessed by the number of adverse events and abnormal laboratory results. Clinical and biochemical efficacy measures were collected but were not statistically-powered. Fourteen patients receiving mannitol completed the trial (in addition to eight patients on placebo). Mannitol-related severe adverse events were not observed. Gastrointestinal symptoms limited dose escalation in 6/14 participants on mannitol. None of the clinical or biochemical efficacy secondary outcome measures significantly differed between groups. We concluded that long-term use of 18 g per day of oral mannitol is safe in Parkinson's disease patients but only two third of patients tolerate this maximal dose. These findings should be considered in the design of future efficacy trials.",

    "abstract": "The limitations of current treatments in delaying dopaminergic neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) raise the need for alternative therapies that can restore these neurons. Much effort is currently directed toward a better understanding of neuroregeneration using preclinical in vivo models. This regenerative capability for self-repair is, however, inefficient in mammals. Non-mammalian animals like zebrafish have thus emerged as an excellent neuroregenerative model due to its capability to continuously self-renew and have a close brain homology to humans. As part of the effort in elucidating cellular events involved in neuroregeneration in vivo, we have established the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced adult zebrafish-based PD model. This was achieved through the optimized intracerebroventricular (ICV) microinjection of 99.96\u00a0mM 6-OHDA to specifically ablate dopaminergic neurons (DpN) in the ventral diencephalon (Dn) of zebrafish brain. Immunofluorescence indicated more than 85% of DpN ablation at day three postlesion and full restoration of DpN at lesioned site 30 days postlesion. The present study determined the impairment and subsequent recovery of zebrafish swimming behavior following lesion by using the open field test through which two parameters, distance traveled (cm) and mean speed (cm/s), were quantified. The locomotion was assessed by analyzing the recordings of individual fish of each group (n = 6) using video tracking software. The findings showed a significant (p < 0.0001) reduction in speed (cm/s) and distance traveled (cm) of lesioned zebrafish 3 days postlesion when compared to sham. The lesioned zebrafish exhibited full recovery of swimming behavior 30 days postlesion. The present findings suggest that 6-OHDA lesioned adult zebrafish is an excellent model with reproducible quality to facilitate the study of neuroregeneration in PD. Future studies on the mechanisms underlying neuroregeneration as well as intrinsic and extrinsic factors that modulate the process may provide important insight into new cell replacement treatment strategies against PD.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, has dramatically increased worldwide from 2,5 million in 1990, to 6,1 million in 2016. This condition continues to unfold its complexity, being nowadays recognized more as a syndrome rather than a disease. Beside the motor symptoms, the non-motor features, which can appear as early as twenty years before the classic onset, are now included in the diagnostic criteria. Increased public awareness, early recognition, and intervention (mostly neuroprotective) could highly increase the quality of life of people suffering from PD. We believe that these measures must be taken without delay, in order to counteract the increasing prevalence of PD worldwide. ",

    "abstract": "The Modified Parkinson Activity Scale (M-PAS) is used to identify the most important activity limitations in patients with Parkinson's disease. We developed a Japanese version of the M-PAS and evaluated its reliability and validity.\nTwenty-five patients with Parkinson's disease (median age 71 years old, range 58-83) were enrolled, and two raters used the Japanese version of M-PAS to assess the subjects. The inter-rater reliability was evaluated using Cohen's weighted kappa coefficient for the total score and three domain scores; systematic error was investigated using Bland-Altman analysis. Concurrent validity of the Japanese M-PAS was measured using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients.\nCohen's kappa coefficients for the total score and the three domain scores were in the range 0.81-0.98, and 95% confidence intervals included zero for each item, suggesting excellent agreement and no systematic errors. The scores of the Japanese version of M-PAS were significantly correlated with the scores of the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part II (Spearman's rho=-0.56, P <0.01) and Part III (Spearman's rho=-0.32, P <0.01). The percentage of patients with the highest and the lowest scores in the Japanese version of M-PAS suggested no ceiling or floor effects.\nThe Japanese version of M-PAS showed excellent inter-rater reliability and good concurrent validity without ceiling or floor effects.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and is common among the middle-aged and elderly populations. Increasing evidence shows that the gut microbiota may trigger PD through the \"gut-microbiota-brain\" axis. A previous study revealed that constipation, one of the non-motor symptoms of PD, affects gut microbiota and the progression of PD. However, whether constipation is involved in gut microbiota-associated PD is largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between gut microbiota, PD, and constipation in this study. We carried out 16S rRNA sequencing in 15 constipated PD patients (C-PD), 14 non-constipated PD (NC-PD) patients, and 15 healthy controls to evaluate the microbial population. Furthermore, co-occurrence networks were used to assess the gut ecology of the three groups. Spearman analyses were used to analyze the correlation between the differential microbiota and the clinical features. The results showed that there were differences in the composition of the gut microbiota among the C-PD group, the NC-PD group, and the healthy controls. No significant differences were observed in the alpha diversity among the three groups, but the beta diversity differed significantly among the groups. Compared with the healthy controls, the abundance of ",

    "abstract": "With a dual-tracer PET study design, this study aimed to identify the differences between PD patients with and without probable RBD (PD+RBD+/PD+RBD-) and the influence of timing of RBD onset [probable RBD anterior to PD onset (PD+RBDa)/probable RBD posterior to PD onset (PD+RBDp)].\nSeventy-four PD+RBD+\u00a0patients, sixty-three PD+RBD-patients and twenty healthy controls were enrolled. Clinical variates, striatal DAT tracer uptake, voxel-wise glucose metabolism and Parkinson's disease-related pattern (PDRP) expressions were compared among groups.\nNo significant difference were found on clinical characteristics between PD+RBD+ and PD+RBD-groups. Compared with PD+RBD-group, PD+RBD+\u00a0group had more severe dopaminergic dysfunction (p<0.05) except for posterior putamen in the more affected hemisphere (MAH) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.350). Meanwhile, it showed relative hypermetabolism in anterior putamen in the less affected hemisphere (LAH), bilateral anterior pallidum with wider involvement in the LAH, hippocampus and para-hippocampus in the LAH and bilateral olfactory gyrus, together with relative hypometabolism in limited bilateral posterio-parietal area (p<0.001). Significantly elevated PDRP expression was also seen in PD+RBD+\u00a0group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). For the timing of RBD onset, PD+RBDa patients harbored greater progression rate than PD+RBDp patients (p<0.01), greater DAT declining rates of striatal subregions and greater increasing rate of PDRP expressions than both PD+RBDp and PD+RBD-patients (p<0.05).\nOur study found that PD patients with probable RBD have worse striatal dopaminergic dysfunction and higher PDRP network activity, supporting the assumption that PD with RBD may be a specific phenotype of PD. Additionally, RBD preceding PD onset may indicate a steeper disease decline.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. A greater prevalence and incidence of PD are reported in men than in women, suggesting a potential contribution of sex, genetic difference and/or sex hormones. This review presents an overview of epidemiological and clinical studies investigating sex differences in the incidence and symptoms of PD. This sex difference is replicated in animal models of PD showing an important neuroprotective role of sex steroids. Therefore, although gender and genetic factors likely contribute to the sex difference in PD, focus here will be on sex hormones because of their neuroprotective role. Androgens receive less attention than estrogen. It is well known that endogenous androgens are more abundant in healthy men than in women and decrease with aging; lower levels are reported in PD men than in healthy male subjects. Drug treatments with androgens, androgen precursors, antiandrogens, and drugs modifying androgen metabolism are available to treat various endocrine conditions, thus having translational value for PD but none have yet given sufficient positive effects for PD. Variability in the androgen receptor is reported in humans and is an additional factor in the response to androgens. In animal models of PD used to study neuroprotective activity, the androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone have given inconsistent results. 5\u03b1-Reductase inhibitors have shown neuroprotective activity in animal models of PD and antidyskinetic activity. Hence, androgens have not consistently shown beneficial or deleterious effects in PD but numerous androgen-related drugs are available that could be repurposed for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. PD pathogenesis includes both genetic and environmental factors. Previous studies have linked the disease with several genes such as Parkin, SNCA, PINK1 and HTRA2. BiNGO software utilizes GO annotations in order to detect over-represented genes in terms of biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. Three databases were utilized for this study (Ensembl, DisGeNET and UniProt). Data processing provided 110 genes associated with PD for further analysis. The aim of this study was to identify genes associated with PD and perform a functional enrichment analysis. Cytoscape and BiNGO software analysis presented several new genes that could play a potential role in pathogenesis of the disease. Future steps include additional research in order to establish the exact mechanism of action of these genes and pathways on PD.",

    "abstract": "In patients with Parkinson Disease (PD), self-initiated or internally cued (IC) actions are thought to be compromised by the disease process, as exemplified by impairments in action initiation. In contrast, externally-cued (EC) actions which are made in response to sensory prompts can restore a remarkable degree of movement capability in PD, particularly alleviating freezing-of-gait. This study investigates the electrophysiological underpinnings of movement facilitation in PD through visuospatial cuing, with particular attention to the dynamics within the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and lateral premotor cortex (LPMC) axis of the dorsal visual stream.\nInvasive cortical recordings over the PPC and LPMC were obtained during deep brain stimulation lead implantation surgery. Thirteen PD subjects performed an action selection task, which was constituted by left or right joystick movement with directional visual cuing in the EC condition and internally generated direction selection in the IC condition. Time-resolved neural activities within and between the PPC and LPMC were compared between EC and IC conditions.\nReaction times (RT) were significantly faster in the EC condition relative to the IC condition (paired t-test, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0015). PPC-LPMC inter-site phase synchrony within the \u03b2-band (13-35\u00a0Hz) was significantly greater in the EC relative to the IC condition. Greater PPC-LPMC \u03b2 debiased phase lag index (dwPLI) prior to movement onset was correlated with faster reaction times only in the EC condition. Multivariate granger causality (GC) was greater in the EC condition relative to the IC condition, prior to and during movement.\nRelative to IC actions, we report relative increase in inter-site phase synchrony and directional PPC to LPMC connectivity in the \u03b2-band during preparation and execution of EC actions. Furthermore, increased strength of connectivity is predictive of faster RT, which are pathologically slow in PD patients. Stronger engagement of the PPC-LPMC cortical network by an EC specifically through the channel of \u03b2-modulation is implicated in correcting the pathological slowing of action initiation seen in Parkinson's patients.\nThese findings shed light on the electrophysiological mechanisms that underlie motor facilitation in PD patients through visuospatial cuing.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a disease that involves neurodegeneration and is characterised by the motor symptoms which include muscle rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia. Other non-motor symptoms include pain, depression, anxiety, and psychosis. This disease affects up to ten million people worldwide. The pathophysiology behind PD is due to the neurodegeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway. There are many conventional drugs used in the treatment of PD. However, there are limitations associated with conventional drugs. For instance, levodopa is associated with the on-off phenomenon, and it may induce wearing off as time progresses. Therefore, this review aimed to analyze the newly approved drugs by the United States-Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) from 2016-2019 as the adjuvant therapy for the treatment of PD symptoms in terms of efficacy and safety. The new drugs include safinamide, istradefylline and pimavanserin. From this review, safinamide is considered to be more efficacious and safer as the adjunct therapy to levodopa as compared to istradefylline in controlling the motor symptoms. In Study 016, both safinamide 50 mg (",

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) plays a critical role in effective disease management and delayed disease progression. This study reports a technique that could diagnose and differentiate PD from essential tremor (ET) in its earlier stage using a non-motor phenotype. Autonomic dysfunction, an early symptom in PD patients, is caused by \u03b1-synuclein pathogenesis in the central nervous system and can be diagnosed using skin vasomotor response to cold stimuli. In this study, the investigations were performed using data collected from 20 PD, 20 ET and 20 healthy subjects. Infrared thermography was used for the cold stress test to observe subjects' hand temperature before and after cold stimuli. The results show that the recovery rate of hand temperature was significantly different between the groups. The data obtained in the cold stress test were verified using Pearson's cross-correlation technique, which showed that few disease parameters like medication and motor rating score had an impact on the recovery rate of hand temperature in PD subjects. The characteristics of the three groups were compared and classified using the k-means clustering algorithm. The sensitivity and specificity of these techniques were analyzed using an Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyzer. These results show that this non-invasive technique can be used as an effective tool in the diagnosis and differentiation of PD in its early stage.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience significant impairments to gait and balance; as a result, the rate of falls in people with Parkinson's disease is much greater than that of the general population. Falls can have a catastrophic impact on quality of life, often resulting in serious injury and even death. The number (or rate) of falls is often used as a primary outcome in clinical trials on PD. However, falls data can be unreliable, expensive and time-consuming to collect. We sought to validate and test a novel digital biomarker for PD that uses wearable sensor data obtained during the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test to predict the number of falls that will be experienced by a person with PD. Three datasets, containing a total of 1057 (671 female) participants, including 71 previously diagnosed with PD, were included in the analysis. Two statistical approaches were considered in predicting falls counts: the first based on a previously reported falls risk assessment algorithm, and the second based on elastic net and ensemble regression models. A predictive model for falls counts in PD showed a mean R",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder that affects around 2% of the population over 65 years old. It is characterized by the progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, resulting in motor disabilities of the patients. At present, only symptomatic cures are available, without suppressing disease progression. In this frame, the anti-diabetic drug metformin has been investigated as a potential disease modifier for PD, being a low-cost and generally well-tolerated medication, which has been successfully used for decades in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Despite the precise mechanisms of action of metformin being not fully elucidated, the drug has been known to influence many cellular pathways that are associated with PD pathology. In this review, we present the evidence in the literature supporting the neuroprotective role of metformin, i.e., autophagy upregulation, degradation of pathological \u03b1-synuclein species, and regulation of mitochondrial functions. The epidemiological studies conducted in diabetic patients under metformin therapy aimed at evaluating the correlation between long-term metformin consumption and the risk of developing PD are also discussed. Finally, we provide an interpretation for the controversial results obtained both in experimental models and in clinical studies, thus providing a possible rationale for future investigations for the repositioning of metformin for PD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience various motor and non-motor symptoms. We conducted a post hoc analysis of a Japanese phase 2/3 study of safinamide (50 or 100\u00a0mg/day) in patients with Parkinson's disease and wearing-off to evaluate response according to background factors. Safinamide efficacy against major motor symptoms was also assessed.\nMultiple regression analyses in safinamide-treated patients (50\u00a0or 100\u00a0mg/day) assessed changes in daily ON-time without troublesome dyskinesia (hereafter referred to as ON-time) according to baseline clinical variables. Subgroup analyses by baseline Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III score were also conducted. We evaluated cardinal motor symptoms using the UPDRS.\nIn the multiple regression analysis, changes in ON-time were related to baseline non-motor symptoms (UPDRS part I score) and ON-time in the 50-mg group, but no relationships with non-motor symptoms were observed in the 100-mg group. Additionally, in the subgroup analysis of patients with more severe motor symptoms (UPDRS part III score\u00a0>\u00a020), a significant improvement in ON-time was observed only with 100\u00a0mg/day (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). At both doses, safinamide significantly improved cardinal motor symptom scores (bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, axial symptoms, and gait disturbances).\nThe observed response profile to the 50-mg/day dose may be related to baseline non-motor symptoms, but this was not true for the 100-mg/day dose. Both safinamide doses improved major motor symptoms in levodopa-treated patients with PD.",

Additionally, in the subgroup analysis of patients with more severe motor symptoms (UPDRS part III score\u00a0>\u00a020), a significant improvement in ON-time was observed only with 100\u00a0mg/day (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). At both doses, safinamide significantly improved cardinal motor symptom scores (bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, axial symptoms, and gait disturbances).",

    "abstract": "Mutation in the glucocerebrosidase encoding gene (GBA) is one of the most frequent genetic cause of Parkinson's disease. ICGi034-A induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line obtained by reprogramming peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a patient with heterozygous c.1226A > G (p.N370S) mutation in the GBA gene can be used for studying the fundamental mechanisms of the pathogenesis of GBA-associated Parkinson's disease, and for potential drug screening. The iPSCs express pluripotency markers (NANOG, SSEA4, TRA-1-60, OCT4, SOX2), have a normal karyotype, and are capable of producing derivatives of three germ layers.",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of identified Parkinson's disease (PD) risk loci contain genes highly expressed in innate immune cells, yet their role in pathology is not understood. We hypothesize that PD susceptibility genes modulate disease risk by influencing gene expression within immune cells. To address this, we have generated transcriptomic profiles of monocytes from 230 individuals with sporadic PD and healthy subjects. We observed a dysregulation of mitochondrial and proteasomal pathways. We also generated transcriptomic profiles of primary microglia from brains of 55 subjects and observed discordant transcriptomic signatures of mitochondrial genes in PD monocytes and microglia. We further identified 17 PD susceptibility genes whose expression, relative to each risk allele, is altered in monocytes. These findings reveal widespread transcriptomic alterations in PD monocytes, with some being distinct from microglia, and facilitate efforts to understand the roles of myeloid cells in PD as well as the development of biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "The sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has significantly advanced in the past decade. However, the observed unpredictability and variability of AI behavior in noisy signals is still underexplored and represents a challenge when trying to generalize AI behavior to real-life environments, especially for people with a speech disorder, who already experience reduced speech intelligibility. In the context of developing assistive technology for people with Parkinson's disease using automatic speech recognition (ASR), this pilot study reports on the performance of Google Cloud speech-to-text technology with dysarthric and healthy speech in the presence of multi-talker babble noise at different intensity levels. Despite sensitivities and shortcomings, it is possible to control the performance of these systems with current tools in order to measure speech intelligibility in real-life conditions.",

    "abstract": "Exercise has been shown to improve gait in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Stepping practice at higher intensity levels has been suggested as a beneficial treatment option to improve gait in the neurological population. Unfortunately, this mode is poorly understood and underutilized within the PD population. Information on what individuals with PD are doing for exercise would be beneficial to help tailor exercise programs to improve gait and provide exercise options in the community for intensity-based exercise.\nTo investigate the current exercise habits of individuals living with PD in the community aimed at improving walking and to understand the impact of perceived intensity on daily exercise practices.\nOne hundred thirty-eight individuals with PD living in the community were surveyed online regarding their current exercise habits.\nA total of 22 questions aimed to understand exercise selection, focus, and perceived intensity. Questions asked basic demographic, symptom presentation and management of disease related symptoms that were present while living with PD. Exercise questions focused understanding participants current function level, practice exercise habits and perceived levels of exercise intensity during daily routines.\nOf the 138 individuals surveyed for this preliminary study, eighty-seven percent of individuals with PD participated in exercise with seventy-five percent choosing walking as a mode for exercise. Sixty-five percent of the respondents noted that despite exercise, their walking speed and endurance has worsened since diagnosis. Eighty-one percent perceived exercising at moderate intensity levels, however little provocation of intensity symptoms was noted.\nOur preliminary study survey results suggest that individuals with PD are exercising but not at high enough intensity levels to promote improvements in gait performance. Individuals with PD may need to be pushed at higher intensity levels, beyond their voluntary limits, to induce gait performance changes. These findings can provide a foundation for future fitness interventions within this population to target improving gait.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is currently diagnosed based on characteristic motor dysfunctions induced by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta [1], [2]. The animal model most commonly used to reproduce PD-related motor deficits in rats is the massive degeneration of nigrostriatal neurons by using intracerebral infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) [3], [4]. This article presents data related to the research article \"Quantifying muscle alterations in a Parkinson's disease animal model using electromyographic biomarkers\" [5]. This study evaluated the effect of PD neurotoxic lesion model on muscle function of freely moving rats. The effects on muscle function considering the time post-lesion have never been described for this Parkinson's disease model. Electromyographic recordings were obtained from control and hemiparkinsonian rats walking in a circular treadmill. Chronic EMG electrodes were implanted subcutaneously in a hindlimb muscle - the biceps femoris muscle - for evaluating muscular activity during the gait. Five dataset of EMG recordings are presented in this article corresponding to control animals and four groups of lesioned animals at different time post-injury (three to six weeks after lesion). Stationarity of the EMG signals were established and the effective muscular contractions were detected by using signal processing methods described in [5]. Power spectrum density was characterized through the mean and median frequencies and signals probability distribution function analysis was also performed.These analyses have shown that PSD frequency contents progressively fall with time post-lesion suggesting muscle function changes along this enclosed time. This dataset could be reused to investigate muscular activation parameters under control and lesioned conditions in freely moving rats and for evaluating different signal processing methods for EMG patterns detection.",

    "abstract": "Younger age of onset and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are both independently associated with poorer quality of life (QOL) in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThe primary objective was to determine whether MCI differentially impacts QOL in young-onset PD (YOPD) and typical-onset PD (TOPD).\nYOPD patients (n\u00a0=\u00a077) were diagnosed at age 50 or younger, TOPD (n\u00a0=\u00a077) were diagnosed after age 50, and the groups were matched for cognitive status, education, and disease duration. Patients' cognitive status was classified as MCI or cognitively normal (CN) based on MDS Level II criteria. QOL was assessed using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). ANCOVAs were conducted for each PDQ-39 subscale, with age of onset and cognitive status as between-subjects factors and several covariates included.\nAn interaction for the Cognition domain revealed that in TOPD, PD-MCI patients reported poorer QOL than CN patients, whereas there was no effect of MCI on cognitive satisfaction in YOPD. There was a main effect of age on Emotional Well-Being, as YOPD reported poorer QOL than TOPD in this domain. There were main effects of cognitive status, with PD-MCI patients reporting worse QOL than CN patients in the domains of Social Support, Communication, ADLs, and Mobility.\nThe interaction revealed that PD-MCI has a greater impact on degree of cognitive concerns (\"cognitive QOL\") in TOPD versus YOPD. A more nuanced understanding of the effects of age of onset, MCI, and their interactions on QOL in PD will inform interventions aimed at improving quality of life in this population.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD) long-term motor outcomes of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) are well documented, while comprehensive reports on non-motor outcomes are fewer and less consistent.\nTo report motor and non-motor symptoms after 5-years of STN-DBS.\nWe performed an open 5-year extension study of a randomized trial that compared intraoperative verification versus mapping of STN using microelectrode recordings. Changes from preoperative to 5-years of STN-DBS were evaluated for motor and non-motor symptoms (MDS-UPDRS I-IV), sleep disturbances (PDSS), autonomic symptoms (Scopa-Aut), quality of life (PDQ-39) and cognition through a neuropsychological test battery. We evaluated whether any differences between the two randomization groups were still present, and assessed preoperative predictors of physical dependence after 5\u2009years of treatment using logistic regression.\nWe found lasting improvement of off-medication motor symptoms (total MDS-UPDRS III, bradykinetic-rigid symptoms and tremor), on-medication tremor, motor fluctuations, and sleep disturbances, but reduced performance across all cognitive domains, except verbal memory. Reduction of verbal fluency and executive function was most pronounced the first year and may thus be more directly related to the surgery than worsening in other domains. The group mapped with multiple microelectrode recordings had more improvement of bradykinetic-rigid symptoms and of PDQ-39 bodily discomfort sub-score, but also more reduction in word fluency. Older age was the most important factor associated with physical dependence after 5\u2009years.\nSTN-DBS offers good long-term effects, including improved sleep, despite disease progression. STN-DBS surgery may negatively impact verbal fluency and executive function.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of most common neurodegenerative disorders caused by a combination of environmental and genetic risk factors. Currently, numerous population genetic studies have shown that polymorphisms in myeloid cell-triggered receptor II (TREM2) are associated with a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, TREM2 has been verified to represent a promising candidate gene for PD susceptibility and progression. For example, the expression of TREM2 was apparently increased in the prefrontal cortex of PD patients. Moreover, the rare missense mutations in TREM2 (rs75932628, p.R47H) was confirmed to be a risk factor of PD. In addition, overexpression of TREM2 reduced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model of PD. Due to the complex pathogenesis of PD, there is still no effective drug treatment. Thus, TREM2 has received increasing widespread attention as a potential therapeutic target. This review focused on the variation of TREM2 in PD and roles of TREM2 in PD pathogenesis, such as excessive-immune inflammatory response, \u03b1-Synuclein aggregation and oxidative stress, to further provide evidence for new immune-related biomarkers and therapies for PD.",

    "abstract": "Constipation and defecatory dysfunctions are frequent symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The pathology of Lewy bodies in colonic and rectal cholinergic neurons suggests that cholinergic pathways are involved in colorectal dysmotility in PD. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of central dopaminergic denervation in rats, induced by injection 6-hydroxydopamine into the bilateral substania nigra (6-OHDA rats), on colorectal contractive activity, content of acetylcholine (ACh), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and expression of neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and muscarinic receptor (MR). Strain gauge force transducers combined with electrical field stimulation (EFS), gut transit time, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, western blot and ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry were used in this study. The 6-OHDA rats exhibited outlet obstruction constipation characterized by prolonged transit time, enhanced contractive tension and fecal retention in colorectum. Pretreatment with tetrodotoxin significantly increased the colorectal motility. EFS-induced cholinergic contractions were diminished in the colorectum. Bethanechol chloride promoted colorectal motility in a dose-dependent manner, and much stronger reactivity of bethanechol chloride was observed in 6-OHDA rats. The ACh, VIP and protein expression of nNOS was decreased, but M",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurodegeneration and has a prediagnostic phase with a lot of challenges to identify clinical and laboratory biomarkers for those in the earliest stages or those 'at risk'. Despite the current research effort, further progress in this field hinges on the more effective application of digital biomarker and artificial intelligence applications at the prediagnostic stages of PD. It is of the highest importance to stratify such prediagnostic subjects that seem to have the most neuroprotective benefit from drugs. However, current initiatives to identify individuals at risk or in the earliest stages that might be candidates for future clinical trials are still challenging due to the limited accuracy and explainability of existing prediagnostic detection and progression prediction solutions. In this brief paper, we report on a novel digital neuro signature (DNS) for prodromal-PD based on selected digital biomarkers previously discovered on preclinical Alzheimer's disease. (AD). Our preliminary results demonstrated a standard DNS signature for both preclinical AD and prodromal PD, containing a ranked selection of features. This novel DNS signature was rapidly repurposed out of 793 digital biomarker features and selected the top 20 digital biomarkers that are predictive and could detect both the biological signature of preclinical AD and the biological mechanism of a-synucleinopathy in prodromal PD. The resulting model can provide physicians with a pool of patients potentially eligible for therapy and comes along with information about the importance of the digital biomarkers that are predictive, based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Similar initiatives could clarify the stage before and around diagnosis, enabling the field to push into unchartered territory at the earliest stages of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a motor neurodegenerative disease principally manifested by motor disabilities, such as postural instability, bradykinesia, tremor, and stiffness. In clinical practice, there exist several diagnostic rating scales that coarsely allow the measurement, characterization and classification of disease progression. These scales, however, are only based on strong changes in kinematic patterns, and the classification remains subjective, depending on the expertise of physicians. In addition, even for experts, disease analysis based on independent classical motor patterns lacks sufficient sensitivity to establish disease progression. Consequently, the disease diagnosis, stage, and progression could be affected by misinterpretations that lead to incorrect or inefficient treatment plans. This work introduces a multimodal non-invasive strategy based on video descriptors that integrate patterns from gait and eye fixation modalities to assist PD quantification and to support the diagnosis and follow-up of the patient. The multimodal representation is achieved from a compact covariance descriptor that characterizes postural and time changes of both information sources to improve disease classification.\nA multimodal approach is introduced as a computational method to capture movement abnormalities associated with PD. Two modalities (gait and eye fixation) are recorded in markerless video sequences. Then, each modality sequence is represented, at each frame, by primitive features composed of (1)\u00a0kinematic measures extracted from a dense optical flow, and (2)\u00a0deep features extracted from a convolutional network. The spatial distributions of these characteristics are compactly coded in covariance matrices, making it possible to map each particular dynamic in a Riemannian manifold. The temporal mean covariance is then computed and submitted to a supervised Random Forest algorithm to obtain a disease prediction for a particular patient. The fusion of the covariance descriptors and eye movements integrating deep and kinematic features is evaluated to assess their contribution to disease quantification and prediction. In particular, in this study, the gait quantification is associated with typical patterns observed by the specialist, while ocular fixation, associated with early disease characterization, complements the analysis.\nIn a study conducted with 13 control subjects and 13 PD patients, the fusion of gait and ocular fixation, integrating deep and kinematic features, achieved an average accuracy of 100% for early and late fusion. The classification probabilities show high confidence in the prediction diagnosis, the control subjects probabilities being lower than 0.27 with early fusion and 0.3 with late fusion, and those of the PD patients, being higher than 0.62 with early fusion and 0.51 with late fusion. Furthermore, it is observed that higher probability outputs are correlated with more advanced stages of the disease, according to the H&Y scale.\nA novel approach for fusing motion modalities captured in markerless video sequences was introduced. This multimodal integration had a remarkable discrimination performance in a study conducted with PD and control patients. The representation of compact covariance descriptors from kinematic and deep features suggests that the proposed strategy is a potential tool to support diagnosis and subsequent monitoring of the disease. During fusion it was observed that devoting major attention to eye fixational patterns may contribute to a better quantification of the disease, especially at stage 2.",

The classification probabilities show high confidence in the prediction diagnosis, the control subjects probabilities being lower than 0.27 with early fusion and 0.3 with late fusion, and those of the PD patients, being higher than 0.62 with early fusion and 0.51 with late fusion. Furthermore, it is observed that higher probability outputs are correlated with more advanced stages of the disease, according to the H&Y scale.",

    "abstract": "Many people with Parkinson disease (PD) experience freezing of gait (FoG), a transient gait disturbance associated with increased fall risk and reduced quality of life. Head-mounted virtual reality (VR) systems allow overground walking and can create immersive simulations of physical environments that induce FoG.\nFor people with PD who experience FoG (PD+FoG), are kinematic gait changes observed in VR simulations of FoG-provoking environments?\nIn a cross-sectional experiment, people with PD+FoG walked at their self-selected speed in a physical laboratory and virtual laboratory, doorway, and hallway environments. Motion analysis assessed whole-body kinematics, including lower extremity joint excursions, swing phase toe clearance, trunk flexion, arm swing, sagittal plane inclination angle, and spatiotemporal characteristics. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to examine the effects of environment on gait variables, with planned contrasts between laboratory environments and the virtual doorway and hallway.\nTwelve participants with PD+FoG (mean age [standard deviation]=72.8 [6.5] years, disease duration=8.8 [8.9] years, 3 females) completed the protocol. The environment had significant and widespread effects on kinematic and spatiotemporal variables. Compared to the physical laboratory, reduced joint excursions were observed in the ankle, knee, and hip when walking in the virtual doorway and in the knee and hip when walking in the virtual hallway. In both the virtual doorway and hallway compared to the physical laboratory, peak swing phase toe clearance, arm swing, and inclination angle were reduced, and walking was slower, with shorter, wider steps.\nVirtual doorway and hallway environments induced kinematic changes commonly associated with FoG episodes, and these kinematic changes are consistent with forward falls that are common during FoG episodes. Combined with the flexibility of emerging VR technology, this research supports the potential of VR applications designed to improve the understanding, assessment, and treatment of FoG.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by the interplay of genetic and environmental factors during brain aging. About 90 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been recently discovered associations with PD, but whether they associate with the clinical features of PD have not been fully addressed yet.\nClinical data of 365 patients with PD who enrolled in Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study were obtained. Patients with rapid motor progression were determined through clinical assessments over five years follow-up. In addition, genetic information of 44 targeted SNPs was extracted from the genetic database of NeuroX for the same cohort. Logistic regression was used to analyze the genetic associations with rapid motor progression of PD.\nAmong 365 patients with PD, there are more male (66%) than female (34%). Seven SNPs (rs6808178, rs115185635, rs12497850, rs34311866, rs3793947, rs11060180, rs9568188) were associated with faster motor progression (p < 0.05), and only rs6808178 passed multiple comparison correction (p < 0.0011). In addition, the extended 44 SNPs with autonomic dysfunction reach a fair prediction of AUC at 0.821.\nGenetics and autonomic function factors contribute to the motor progression at the clinical initiation of PD.",

    "abstract": "To estimate the point prevalence and cumulative incidence of caregiver-reported aggressive behaviors among people living with advanced Parkinson disease and related disorders (PDRDs) and secondarily examine variables associated with aggression.\nCaregivers from a clinical trial of outpatient palliative care for PDRD were surveyed about patient aggression at baseline and every 3 months over 12 months. Baseline responses were used for point prevalence. Cumulative incidence was calculated using responses from caregivers with no reported baseline aggression and available data at all other time points. Measures of disease severity, quality of life, mood, and caregiver burden were included in correlation and relative risk models, adjusting for age, sex, and diagnosis.\nOf 170 caregivers, 31 (18.2%) reported physical aggression, and 18 (10.6%) reported sexual aggression. Twelve-month cumulative incidence for physical and sexual aggression was 21.1% (23/109) and 16.0% (19/119), respectively. Physical aggression cumulative incidence was associated with patient depression (\nThere was a high prevalence and incidence of aggression in our PDRD cohort. This is an understudied issue in PDRD, and our findings highlight the need for increased awareness among neurologists.

    "abstract": "To determine whether varenicline is effective for the balance in Parkinson disease (PD).\nThis was an investigator-initiated, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants with a clinical diagnosis of PD were randomized to receive varenicline or placebo for 8 weeks. After dose escalation, participants took 1 mg of drug twice daily until the end of the study. Patients with severe tremor were excluded. Primary outcome was a change on the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) from baseline to 8 weeks. The BBS is a 14-item measure consisting of basic balance tasks. The study had a secondary, exploratory outcome of a change in cognition, measured with the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) from baseline to 8 weeks. The FAB is a 6-item measure of executive functioning.\nThirty-six participants were randomized (82% men, 100% White). Average age was 71.0 years (\u00b1 8.1). Average baseline motor Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale was 34.7 (\u00b1 11.6). There were no differences between treatment groups on the BBS (F[1,28] = 2.85, \nThe results did not suggest that varenicline had an effect on balance in patients with PD. Furthermore, varenicline did not seem to affect cognition. Perhaps, if an objective measure of balance had been used in place of the BBS, the analysis would show a difference between the groups. However, the authors do not recommend further study.\nThis study provides Class III evidence that in patients with PD with Hoehn and Yahr stages 2, 3, or 4, varenicline does not improve balance as assessed by the BBS.",

    "abstract": "In addition to the classic motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), people with PD frequently experience nonmotor symptoms that can include autonomic dysfunction and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as PD psychosis (PDP). Common patient characteristics, including older age, use of multiple medications, and arrhythmias, are associated with increased risk of corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation, and treatments for PDP (antipsychotics, dementia medications) may further increase this risk. This review evaluates how medications used to treat PDP affect QTc interval from literature indexed in the PubMed and Embase databases. Although not indicated for the treatment of psychosis, dementia therapies such as donepezil, rivastigmine, memantine, and galantamine are often used with or without antipsychotics and have minimal effects on QTc interval. Among the antipsychotics, data suggesting clinically meaningful QTc interval prolongation are limited. However, many antipsychotics have other safety concerns. Aripiprazole, olanzapine, and risperidone negatively affect motor function and are not recommended for PDP. Quetiapine is often sedating, can exacerbate underlying neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, and may prolong the QTc interval. Pimavanserin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016 and remains the only FDA-approved medication available to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with PDP. However, pimavanserin can increase QTc interval by approximately 5-8 ms. The potential for QTc prolongation should be considered in patients with symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias and those receiving QT-prolonging medications. In choosing a medication to treat PDP, expected efficacy must be balanced with potential safety concerns for individual patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to a progressive loss of locomotor automaticity. Consequently, PD patients rely more on executive resources for the control of gait, resulting in increased prefrontal activity while walking. Exercise-based training programs may improve automaticity of walking and reduce prefrontal activity in this population. This study aimed to assess the effect of an intensive multidisciplinary exercise-based training program on prefrontal activity and gait performance during usual walking in PD patients.\nFourteen patients (mean age: 67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09; disease duration: 6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0years; Hoehn and Yahr score: 1.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6) were included in this study. They were assessed in ON stage at three different times at 5-week intervals: two times before the training program (T0 and T1) and once after the training program (T2). Gait performance (stride time, speed, stride length, cadence, and their respective coefficient of variation) and cortical activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) were measured during usual walking.\nPatients had reduced cortical activity of the DLPFC at T2 compared to T1 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Patients had shorter stride time at T2 compared to T1 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025) and tended to have longer stride length at T2 than at T1 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.056).\nThe training program led to positive effects on prefrontal activity and gait performance. Reduced prefrontal activity during usual walking after training program suggests that patients may have a greater reserve capacity to face more challenging walking conditions. Further studies will investigate the effect of this training on cortical activity during dual-task walking..",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for the motor impairments of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. However, mood or behavioral changes, such as mania, hypomania, and impulsive disorders, can occur postoperatively. It has been suggested that these symptoms are associated with the stimulation of the limbic subregion of the STN. Electrophysiological studies demonstrate that the low-frequency activities in ventral STN are modulated during emotional processing. In this study, we report 22 patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent STN DBS for treatment of motor impairment and presented stimulation-induced mood elevation during initial postoperative programming. The contact at which a euphoric state was elicited by stimulation was termed as the hypomania-inducing contact (HIC) and was further correlated with intraoperative local field potential recorded during the descending of DBS electrodes. The power of four frequency bands, namely, \u03b8 (4-7 Hz), \u03b1 (7-10 Hz), \u03b2 (13-35 Hz), and \u03b3 (40-60 Hz), were determined by a non-linear variation of the spectrogram using the concentration of frequency of time (conceFT). The depth of maximum \u03b8 power is located approximately 2 mm below HIC on average and has significant correlation with the location of contacts (",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies have several commonalities including neurochemical, morphological and clinical features as well as widespread of cortical and limbic \u03b1-synuclein and amyloid-\u03b2 pathologies. Thus, we evaluated the action of hesperidin on \u03b1-synuclein and amyloid-\u03b2-induced neurodegeneration in Drosophila melanogaster. The disease causing human A\u03b2 peptide or \u03b1- synuclein was expressed respectively, in Elav-GAL4 (pan-neuronally) and dopaminergic neurons (ddc-GAL4) using the UAS-GAL4 system. Flies were either grown on food media supplemented with or without hesperidin (HSD) (1, 5, or 10mM). Behavioral assays were carried to investigate the effect of treatment on fecundity, larval motility, climbing ability and lifespan. A\u03b2>Elav or \u03b1-syn>DDC caused significant decrease in fecundity, larva contraction, motility, survival rate, and climbing activities in flies indicative of neurodegeneration. However, supplementation of flies' media with hesperidin (1mM, 5mM and 10mM) showed a dose-dependent increase in the number of line crosses in the egg laying, larva motility, climbing activity in comparison with flies grown on food media only. Conversely, supplementation of fly feed with HSD caused no significant change in lifespan. Findings from this experiment showed that hesperidin could be a potential neuroprotective agent in the amelioration of PD and AD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD) has become increasingly recognized in recent years, and there is a need to identify methods for cognitive rehabilitation in PD patients.\nThe aim of this study was to explore the feasibility and effects of 2 different computer-based cognitive rehabilitation (CBCR) interventions on attention, executive functions, and quality of life (QoL) in PD patients.\nThirty nondemented PD patients were randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: one passive control group and 2 intervention groups with 2 different CBCR programmes. The intervention period was 8 weeks with follow-up visits in clinic every second week. Before and after the intervention period, patients were tested with a neuropsychological battery of attention, executive functions, and QoL.\nTwenty-four patients completed the study. Patients in one of the CBCR groups experienced a significant within-group increase on the primary measures of attention, executive functions, and QoL. However, this effect was not significant between groups. No significant differences were observed for the other CBCR group or the control group.\nCBCR is a feasible intervention for cognitive rehabilitation in nondemented PD patients. The effects of training were modest and should be further explored in larger clinical trials. Some CBCR programmes might be more effective than others for PD patients. The protocol for this study was published prospectively at ClinicalTrials.gov on September 18, 2017 with ID: NCT03285347.",

    "abstract": "Integration of omics data and deciphering the mechanism of a biological regulatory network could be a promising approach to reveal the molecular mechanism involved in the progression of complex diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Despite having an overlapping mechanism in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the exact mechanism and signaling molecules behind them are still unknown. Further, the acetylation mechanism and histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes provide a positive direction toward studying the shared phenomenon between AD and PD pathogenesis. For instance, increased expression of HDACs causes a decrease in protein acetylation status, resulting in decreased cognitive and memory function. Herein, we employed an integrative approach to analyze the transcriptomics data that established a potential relationship between AD and PD. Data preprocessing and analysis of four publicly available microarray datasets revealed 10 HUB proteins, namely, CDC42, CD44, FGFR1, MYO5A, NUMA1, TUBB4B, ARHGEF9, USP5, INPP5D, and NUP93, that may be involved in the shared mechanism of AD and PD pathogenesis. Further, we identified the relationship between the HUB proteins and transcription factors that could be involved in the overlapping mechanism of AD and PD. CREB1 and HINFP were the crucial regulatory transcription factors that were involved in the AD and PD crosstalk. Further, lysine acetylation sites and HDAC enzyme prediction revealed the involvement of 15 and 27 potential lysine residues of CREB1 and HINFP, respectively. Our results highlighted the importance of HDAC1(K292) and HDAC6(K330) association with CREB1 and HINFP, respectively, in the AD and PD crosstalk. However, different datasets with a large number of samples and wet lab experimentation are required to validate and pinpoint the exact role of CREB1 and HINFP in the AD and PD crosstalk. It is also possible that the different datasets may or may not affect the results due to analysis parameters. In conclusion, our study potentially highlighted the crucial proteins, transcription factors, biological pathways, lysine residues, and HDAC enzymes shared between AD and PD at the molecular level. The findings can be used to study molecular studies to identify the possible relationship in the AD-PD crosstalk.",

    "abstract": "In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), the occurrence of motor and non-motor symptoms increases with disease progression. The range of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) vary among individuals and can be burdensome for caregivers. Only a few studies have identified the contributing factors of NPS and caregiver burden in India.\nWe aimed to study the clinical profile, disability, and predictive factors of NPS in PD patients and associated caregiver's burden.\nThis was a cross-sectional observational study carried out in PD patients and their respective caregivers attending a movement disorder clinic in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Kerala. A total of 104 patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD receiving levodopa therapy and who had a primary caregiver were enrolled in the study. Structured questionnaires were administered to both patients and caregivers to collect data. Data analysis was done using an independent t-test, linear, and multiple regression analysis.\nAmong 104 patients recruited for the study, 61.5% of patients had shown at least one NPS and 40.44% showed multiple NPS. Results from the study showed that depression is the primary NPS occurring in IPD patients (55.8%) followed by irritability, anxiety, and apathy. On linear regression models, the prime determinant of NPS was the Everyday Abilities Scale for India (EASI). For caregiver burden, the main determinants were the presence of NPS, duration of caregiving, EASI, and RBDSQ score.\nNPS in PD are highly associated with and are determinants of caregiver burden. Detailed assessment and specific interventions aimed at NPS could alleviate caregiver burden.",

    "abstract": "Despite substantial clinical and pathophysiological differences, the characteristics of tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET) patients bear certain similarities. The presented study delineates tremor-related structural networks in these two disorders.\n42 non-advanced PD patients (18 tremor-dominant, 24 without substantial tremor), 17\u00a0ET, and 45 healthy controls underwent high-angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging acquisition to reconstruct their structural motor connectomes as a proxy of the anatomical interconnections between motor network regions, implementing state-of-the-art globally optimised probabilistic tractography.\nWhen compared to healthy controls, ET patients exhibited higher structural connectivity in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network. Interestingly, the comparison of tremor-dominant PD patients and PD patients without tremor yielded very similar results - higher structural connectivity in tremor-dominant PD sharing multiple nodes with the tremor network detected in ET, despite the generally lower structural connectivity between basal ganglia and frontal cortex in the whole PD group when compared to healthy controls.\nThe higher structural connectivity of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network seems to be the dominant tremor driver in both PD and ET. While it appears to be the only tremor-related network in ET, its combination with large scale hypoconnectivity in the frontal cortico-subcortical network in PD may explain different clinical features of tremor in these two disorders.",

    "abstract": "To explore the feasibility of using a modified power-on programming method in deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson disease (PD).\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study including 151 PD patients with bilateral robot-assisted DBS surgery from July 2017 to June 2020. Ninety-seven patients were adopted to the modified power-on programming method (Group I) and 54 patients were adopted to the traditional power-on programming method (Group II). In one-year follow-up, power-on programming duration, stimulation parameters, scores of Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) and UPDRS-III of the 2 groups were recorded and compared.\nThere were no significant differences in the postoperative UPDRS, UPDRS-III improvement rate, and stimulation parameters between the 2 groups. The duration of power-on programming of Group I (1.7 \u00b1 1.1 hours) was significantly less than that of Group II (3.5 \u00b1 1.8 hours, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).\nThe modified power-on programming method can achieve a similar clinical effect to the traditional method, with the advantage of more efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Orthostatic hypotension (OH) and abnormal blood pressure (BP) fluctuations occur mainly due to noradrenergic dysfunction and are clinically important in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). They lead to impairments of cognition function, daily activities, and quality of life. Some monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitors have a sympathomimetic amine, which can be attributed to OH. Therefore, we determined whether rasagiline, a common MAO-B inhibitor used in PD treatment, can contribute to cardiovascular autonomic BP dysregulation in patients with early or mild PD.\nNineteen patients with early or mild PD were recruited, and tilt test and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) were performed before and after rasagiline administration. Early or mild PD was defined as patients with de novo (n\u00a0=\u00a04), levodopa (n\u00a0=\u00a010), dopamine agonist (n\u00a0=\u00a01), levodopa and one dopamine agonist (n\u00a0=\u00a02), levodopa and droxidopa (n\u00a0=\u00a01), and levodopa and istradefylline (n\u00a0=\u00a01). Furthermore, patients with motor fluctuation and multiple dopamine agonists were excluded from our study.\nOH and BP frequency were not significantly exacerbated before or after rasagiline administration. No significant differences of type in BP fluctuation on ABPM and the degree of nocturnal BP falls were found before and after rasagiline administration. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score in patients (post-rasagiline administration) was significantly improved compared with before.\nRasagiline seems to be a suitable medication for Parkinsonian symptoms in patients with early and mild PD. It does not exacerbate cardiovascular autonomic responses, circadian rhythm of BP, or both.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) receiving levodopa treatment often report motor complications including wearing-off (WO), dyskinesia, and morning akinesia. As motor complications are associated with a decrease in patients' quality of life (QoL), it is important to identify their occurrence and commence immediate management. This study investigated whether differences in the perception of motor complications exist between patients and their physicians in routine clinical practice.\nAfter an Internet-based screening survey, questionnaires were distributed to physicians and their patients in Japan. The 9-item Wearing-Off Questionnaire (WOQ-9) was used to objectively assess the presence of WO; patients with WOQ-9 scores \u22652 were considered to have WO. McNemar's test was used to compare physician assessment versus WOQ-9 scores, patient self-awareness versus physician assessment, and patient self-awareness versus WOQ-9, separately. Morning akinesia and dyskinesia were assessed by both physician assessment and patient self-awareness with McNemar's test. QoL was assessed using the 8-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8) with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\nA total of 235 patients with PD and their 92 physicians participated in this survey. A significant discordance was observed between the WOQ-9 and physician assessment of WO (67.2% vs 46.0%; \nThis study investigated differences in the perception of WO between patients with PD and their physicians in routine clinical practice and highlighted that patients have a low awareness of the symptoms of WO compared with physician assessments and WOQ-9. Conversely, morning akinesia, dyskinesia, and bodily discomfort were underrecognized by physicians.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the impact of an interprofessional mock code on students' comfort and competency related to Parkinson's disease (PD) medication administration during care transitions.\nPatients with PD are at increased risk for medication errors during hospitalization. Individualization of PD medication creates vulnerability during care transitions.\nFour interprofessional groups took part in this study: baccalaureate degree senior nursing students (n = 113), master's level nurse anesthesia students (n = 35), doctor of osteopathic medicine fourth-year students (n = 32), and doctor of clinical psychology fourth-year students (n = 22). Groups participated in an unfolding case study simulation involving a mock code with a focus on the omission of time-sensitive PD medication. Pre- and postsimulation test results were compared.\nFindings indicated an increased understanding among three of the four groups relating to medication timing during care transitions.\nAll groups improved with respect to perceived comfort and competency.",

    "abstract": "Statistically and clinically significant cognitive declines are observed in a small subset of individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) following treatment with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS).\nWe examine the association between multi-domain cognitive decline (MCD) and demographic and baseline clinical variables and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAE) arising within a six-month interval following DBS for PD.\nStudy participants with PD who displayed MCD at 6-month follow-up evaluation after DBS (n\u00a0=\u00a018) were contrasted with individuals with PD from the same study who did not show cognitive decline after DBS (n\u00a0=\u00a0146). Logistic regression analyses were employed to assess relationship between predictors, including age (>70 years old), pre-DBS cognitive screening test performance, SAE, and MCD. MCD+ and MCD-groups were also compared on other baseline clinical and demographic variables.\nMCD showed modest association with older age and lower baseline neurocognitive screening performance, whereas the groups did not differ on most other baseline clinical and demographic variables. SAEs during the study interval were the most robust predictor of MCD in the DBS group. A variety of SAEs were documented in study participants experiencing MCD after DBS surgery, including, but not limited to, infections and small intracranial hemorrhages.\nOlder age and lower baseline cognition measured prior to treatment are associated with MCD measured at six-months after DBS. SAE occurring following DBS surgery are also predictive of MCD. These predictors may reflect aspects of \"frailty\" in advanced PD. Risk factors for SAE warrant careful consideration in clinical trials.",

This study assesses for the first time the efficacy, safety and feasibility of DfPD\u00ae program in Greek PD patients.\nA total of 16 early-to-mid-stage PD patients (50% men, aged 56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012) underwent a total of 16 60-min classes of adjusted to Greek music and dance culture DfPD\u00ae, twice weekly, over 8 weeks. Assessments were performed at baseline and at the end of the study period and included quality of life (PDQ-8), depressive symptoms (BDI-II), fatigue (PFS-16), cognitive functions (MoCA), balance (BBS) and body mass index (BMI). Safety (possible falls, injuries, muscle soreness or excessive fatigue) and feasibility (technical and financial parameters, willingness for participation and continuation, recruitment rates) were also assessed.\nStatistically significant improvements were found in quality of life (29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a047%, p\u00a0=\u00a00,020), depressive symptoms (26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a052%, p\u00a0=\u00a00,046), fatigue (13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020%, p\u00a0=\u00a00,021), cognitive functions (17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023%, p\u00a0=\u00a00,010), balance (5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04%, p\u00a0=\u00a00,003) and BMI (2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02%, p\u00a0=\u00a00,010). No adverse events, high adherence (93,75%) and low attrition (12,5%) rates were reported.\nA twice weekly 60-min DfPD\u00ae class for 8 weeks is a safe and feasible non-pharmacological complementary therapeutic intervention for Greek PD patients and may improve their quality of life, depressive symptoms, fatigue, cognitive functions, balance, and BMI. Further research on this intervention is warranted.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is associated with changes in brainstem neuronal pathway dysfunction as reflected by vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) and to evaluate associations between VEMPs and REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) and isolated RBD (iRBD).\nEighty-two early-stage PD patients, 40 iRBD patients, and 41 healthy control individuals underwent one-night video-polysomnography (vPSG) and VEMPs examination. We compared cervical (cVEMP), ocular (oVEMP), and masseter (mVEMP) VEMP parameters among PD with RBD (PD\u00a0+\u00a0RBD), PD without RBD (PD-RBD), iRBD, and control groups and analyzed correlations between VEMPs and RSWA in PD and iRBD groups.\nThe PD\u00a0+\u00a0RBD group showed delays in bilateral cVEMP (Lp13, Ln23, Rn23: all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and oVEMP (Ln10, Rn10, Rp15: all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) peak latencies compared with the PD-RBD group. Total cVEMP scores were higher in the PD\u00a0+\u00a0RBD group than in the iRBD group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.033). In PD patients, phasic RSWA was correlated with total cVEMP scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), and tonic RSWA was correlated with left oVEMP scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013).\nBrainstem neurophysiology as evidenced by altered VEMPs in patients with PD and iRBD could reflect disease evolvement. Moreover, VEMPs alterations may vary depending on the presence of RBD in PD patients. The associations between altered RSWA and VEMP parameters highlight the meaningfulness of detecting brainstem dysfunction in early-stage PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, which characterized by increased pathological marker protein, \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) and phosphorylated-Ser129-\u03b1-syn in the extracellular fluids. Current methods of measuring the p-Ser129-\u03b1-syn concentration in cerebrospinal fluid for PD are based on ELISA method, however, the amount of area under the curve (AUC) to predict PD is around 0.7-0.8. Higher confidence level of AUC in p-Ser129-\u03b1-syn quantification for the early diagnosis of PD would be essential.\nDetection of p-Ser129-\u03b1-syn in diluted human serum for diagnosis of PD was investigated by a modified paired surface plasma wave biosensor (PSPWB) using a quarter wave plate for better detection performance. The method combining an immunoassay and non-labeled technique measures the p-Ser129-\u03b1-syn level with high sensitivity and specificity. Ten patients with PD at early stage (Hohn & Yahr stage I and II) and 11 age-matched healthy control participants were recruited for measurement of serum p-Ser129-\u03b1-syn.\nAUC of the p-Ser129-\u03b1-syn in diluted human serum was 0.92 and it shows that p-Ser129-\u03b1-syn in diluted human serum could be used as a sensitive biomarker for the diagnosis of PD in clinics. Results clearly show that the measured p-Ser129-\u03b1-syn concentration in diluted human serum displays a statistical significance between health control subjects and PD patients.\nP-Ser129-\u03b1-syn has low abundance in human serum, high detection sensitivity and specificity are critical to the success of the diagnosis of PD in clinics. In this study, a modified PSPWB was developed that the limit of detection at 1 ng/mL for p-Ser129-\u03b1-syn (standard) spiked into diluted human serum of a healthy control was performed. This result shows that the modified PSPWB can be used as a platform for detecting p-Ser129-\u03b1-syn in diluted human serum as a potential biomarker for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common motor disorder that has become increasingly prevalent in the ageing population. Recent works have suggested that circadian rhythms disruption is a common event in PD patients. Clock genes regulate the circadian rhythm of biological processes in eukaryotic organisms, but their roles in PD remain unclear. Despite this, several lines of evidence point to the possibility that clock genes may have a significant impact on the development and progression of the disease. This review aims to consolidate recent understanding of the roles of clock genes in PD. We first summarized the findings of clock gene expression and epigenetic analyses in PD patients and animal models. We also discussed the potential contributory role of clock gene variants in the development of PD and/or its symptoms. We further reviewed the mechanisms by which clock genes affect mitochondrial dynamics as well as the rhythmic synthesis and secretion of endocrine hormones, the impairment of which may contribute to the development of PD. Finally, we discussed the limitations of the currently available studies, and suggested future potential studies to deepen our understanding of the roles of clock genes in PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by impaired mitochondrial function and decreased ATP levels. Aerobic glycolysis and lactate production have been shown to be upregulated in dopaminergic neurons to sustain ATP levels, but the effect of upregulated glycolysis on dopaminergic neurons remains unknown. Since lactate promotes apoptosis and \u03b1-synuclein accumulation in neurons, we hypothesized that the lactate produced upon upregulated glycolysis is involved in the apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in PD. In this study, we examined the expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the key enzymes in glycolysis, and lactate levels in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of a MPTP-induced mouse model of PD and in MPP",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Although mounting studies have been conducted, no effective therapy is available to halt its progression. Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a naturally occurring compound obtained by \u03b2-thioglucosidase-mediated autolysis of glucobrassicin in cruciferous vegetables. Besides its powerful antioxidant activity, I3C has shown neuroprotection against depression and chemically induced neurotoxicity via its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of I3C against rotenone (ROT)-induced PD in male albino rats. The possible protective mechanisms were also explored. PD was induced by subcutaneous administration of ROT (2\u00a0mg/kg) for 28\u00a0days. The effects of I3C (25, 50, and 100\u00a0mg/kg/day) were assessed by catalepsy test (bar test), spontaneous locomotor activity, rotarod test, weight change, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) expression, striatal dopamine (DA) content, and histological examination. The highest dose of I3C (100\u00a0mg/kg) was the most effective to prevent ROT-mediated motor dysfunctions and amend striatal DA decrease, weight loss, neurodegeneration, TH expression reduction, and \u03b1-Syn expression increase in both the midbrain and striatum. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that the neuroprotective effects of I3C are partially attributed to its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects and the activation of the sirtuin 1/AMP-activated protein kinase pathway. Altogether, these results suggested that I3C could attenuate biochemical, molecular, and functional changes in a rat PD model with following repeated rotenone exposures.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a gradually progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain area called the substantia nigra pars compacta and cytoplasmic alpha-synuclein-rich inclusions termed Lewy bodies. The etiology and pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. The development of reliable biomarkers for the early and accurate diagnosis, including biochemical, genetic, clinical, and neuroimaging markers, is crucial for unraveling the pathogenic processes of the disease as well as patients' progress surveillance. High-throughput technologies and system biology methodologies can support the identification of potent molecular fingerprints together with the establishment of dynamic network biomarkers. Emphasis is given on multi-omics datasets and dysregulated pathways associated with differentially expressed transcripts, modified protein motifs, and altered metabolic profiles. Although there is no therapy that terminates the neurodegenerative process and dopamine replacement strategy with L-DOPA represents the most effective treatment, numerous therapeutic protocols such as dopamine receptor agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, and cholinesterase inhibitors represent candidate treatments providing at the same time valuable network-based approaches to drug repositioning. Computational methodologies and bioinformatics platforms for visualization, clustering, and validating of molecular and clinical datasets provide important insights into diagnostic processing and therapeutic pipeline.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by severe motor symptoms which lead to progressive weakness of motor function caused by prominent loss of dopamine-secreting neurons within the substantia nigra. Compelling neuropathological evidence reveals the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates, such as \u03b1-synuclein and tau, which are important hallmarks of the disease. Protein biochips have great potential to be powerful tools for clinical diagnostics, whereas novel sensing methods implementing biosensors for protein quantification in body fluids are highly required. Herein, the development of a device using a thin film of conductive polymer acid-doped polyaniline that can detect specific biomolecules is examined. The polymer is shown to change conductivity in the presence of proteins, so this direct chemical to electric transduction can be used to quantify concentration alterations. The fabrication of such a device is proposed, so that it can be implemented in rapid screening tests as part of an integrated holistic point-of-care diagnostics model that brings together a multidisciplinary healthcare team of PD experts.",

This study aimed to investigate the voice changes via the CPP measures in the idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), a special case of prodromal neurodegeneration, and recently diagnosed and advanced-stage Parkinson's disease (AS-PD) patients using different speaking tasks across noise-free and noisy environments. The sustained vowel phonation, reading of passages, and monologues of 60 early stage untreated PD, 30 advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, 60 iRBD, and 60 healthy control (HC) participants were evaluated. Significant differences were found between the PD groups and controls in sustained phonation via the CPP (p < 0.05) and CPPS (p < 0.01) and the monologue via the CPP (p < 0.01), although neither the CPP nor CPPS measures were sufficiently sensitive to capture the possible prodromal dysphonia in the iRBD. The quality of the CPP and CPPS measures was influenced substantially by the addition of ambient noise. It was anticipated that the CPP measures might serve as a promising digital biomarker in assessing the dysphonia from the early stages of PD.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in Parkinson's disease is effective; however, its mechanism is unclear. To investigate the degree of neuronal terminal survival after STN-DBS, the authors examined the striatal dopamine transporter levels before and after treatment in association with clinical improvement using PET with [11C]2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane ([11C]CFT).\nTen patients with Parkinson's disease who had undergone bilateral STN-DBS were scanned twice with [11C]CFT PET just before and 1 year after surgery. Correlation analysis was conducted between [11C]CFT binding and off-period Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores assessed preoperatively and postoperatively.\n[11C]CFT uptake reduced significantly in the posterodorsal putamen contralateral to the parkinsonism-dominant side after 1 year; however, an increase was noted in the contralateral anteroventral putamen and ipsilateral ventral caudate postoperatively (p < 0.05). The percentage increase in [11C]CFT binding was inversely correlated with the preoperative binding level in the bilateral anteroventral putamen, ipsilateral ventral caudate, contralateral anterodorsal putamen, contralateral posteroventral putamen, and contralateral nucleus accumbens. The percentage reduction in UPDRS-II score was significantly correlated with the percentage increase in [11C]CFT binding in the ipsilateral anteroventral putamen (p < 0.05). The percentage reduction in UPDRS-III score was significantly correlated with the percentage increase in [11C]CFT binding in the ipsilateral anteroventral putamen, ventral caudate, and nucleus accumbens (p < 0.05).\nSTN-DBS increases dopamine transporter levels in the anteroventral striatum, which is correlated with the motor recovery and possibly suggests the neuromodulatory effect of STN-DBS on dopaminergic terminals in Parkinson's disease patients. A preoperative level of anterior striatal dopamine transporter may predict reserve capacity of STN-DBS on motor recovery.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET) are two common adult-onset tremor disorders in which prevalence increases with age. PD is a neurodegenerative condition with progressive disability. In ET, neurodegeneration is not an established etiology. We sought to determine whether an underlying metabolic pattern may differentiate ET from PD. Circulating metabolites in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. There were several disrupted pathways in PD compared to ET plasma including glycolysis, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tyrosine biosynthesis, purine and glutathione metabolism. Elevated \u03b1-synuclein levels in plasma and CSF distinguished PD from ET. The perturbed metabolic state in PD was associated with imbalance in the pentose phosphate pathway, deficits in energy production, and change in NADPH, NADH and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase levels. This work demonstrates significant metabolic differences in plasma and CSF of PD and ET patients.",

    "abstract": "Aiming at the limitations of clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, an intelligent-aided diagnosis method based on few-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) and time-frequency deep network is proposed for PD with RBD. Firstly, in order to improve the speed of the operation and robustness of the algorithm, the 6-channel scalp EEG of each subject were segmented with the same time-window. Secondly, the model of time-frequency deep network was constructed and trained with time-window EEG data to obtain the segmentation-based classification result. Finally, the output of time-frequency deep network was postprocessed to obtain the subject-based diagnosis result. Polysomnography (PSG) of 60 patients, including 30 idiopathic PD and 30 PD with RBD, were collected by Nanjing Brain Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University and the doctor's detection results of PSG were taken as the gold standard in our study. The accuracy of the segmentation-based classification was 0.902 4 in the validation set. The accuracy of the subject-based classification was 0.933 3 in the test set. Compared with the RBD screening questionnaire (RBDSQ), the novel approach has clinical application value.\n\u9488\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\uff08PD\uff09\u4f34\u5feb\u901f\u773c\u52a8\u7761\u7720\u884c\u4e3a\u969c\u788d\uff08RBD\uff09\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c11\u5bfc\u8054\u8111\u7535\u548c\u65f6\u9891\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd0\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u53ca\u7b97\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u5404\u88ab\u8bd5\u8005\u76846\u5bfc\u8054\u5934\u76ae\u8111\u7535\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7b49\u957f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u63d0\u53d6\uff1b\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u8111\u7535\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u9891\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u5f97\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5bf9\u5404\u88ab\u8bd5\u8005\u6240\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u8111\u7535\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u88ab\u8bd5\u8005\u7684PD\u4f34RBD\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ee5\u5357\u4eac\u533b\u79d1\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u5c5e\u8111\u79d1\u533b\u9662\u91c7\u96c6\u7684PD\u4f34\u548c\u4e0d\u4f34RBD\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u591a\u5bfc\u7761\u7720\u56fe\uff08PSG\uff09\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4e24\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u540430\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u533b\u751f\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a0.902 4\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u88ab\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a0.933 3\uff0c\u6bd4RBD\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b5b\u67e5\u95ee\u5377\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d ",

    "abstract": "Identifying a whole-brain connectome-based predictive model in drug-na\u00efve patients with Parkinson's disease and verifying its predictions on drug-managed patients would be useful in determining the intrinsic functional underpinnings of motor impairment and establishing general brain-behavior associations. In this study, we constructed a predictive model from the resting-state functional data of 47 drug-na\u00efve patients by using a connectome-based approach. This model was subsequently validated in 115 drug-managed patients. The severity of motor impairment was assessed by calculating Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III scores. The predictive performance of model was evaluated using the correlation coefficient (r",

    "abstract": "The constant growth of the population with mobility impairments, such as older adults and people suffering from neurological pathologies like Parkinson's disease (PD), has encouraged the development of multiple devices for gait assistance. Robotic walkers have emerged, improving physical stability and balance and providing cognitive aid in rehabilitation scenarios. Different studies evaluated human gait behavior with passive and active walkers to understand such rehabilitation processes. However, there is no evidence in the literature of studies with robotic walkers in daily living scenarios with older adults with Parkinson's disease. This study presents the assessment of the AGoRA Smart Walker using Ramps Tests and Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT). Ten older adults participated in the study, four had PD, and the remaining six had underlying conditions and fractures. Each of them underwent a physical assessment (i.e., Senior Fitness, hip, and knee strength tests) and then interacted with the AGoRA SW. Kinematic and physical interaction data were collected through the AGoRA walker's sensory interface. It was found that for lower limb strength tests, older adults with PD had increases of at least 15% in all parameters assessed. For the Sit to Stand Test, the Parkinson's group evidenced an increase of 23%, while for the Chair Sit and Reach Test (CSRT), this same group was only 0.04 m away from reaching the target. For the Ramp Up Test (RUT), the subjects had to make a greater effort, and significant differences (",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is an important cellular self-digestion and recycling pathway that helps in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation at various steps of the autophagic and endolysosomal pathway has been reported in several neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington disease (HD) and is cited as a critically important feature for central nervous system (CNS) proteostasis. Recently, another molecular target, namely transcription factor EB (TFEB) has been explored globally to treat neurodegenerative disorders. This TFEB, is a key regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis pathway. Multiple research studies suggested therapeutic potential by targeting TFEB to treat human diseases involving autophagy-lysosomal dysfunction, especially neurodegenerative disorders. A common observation involving all neurodegenerative disorders is their poor efficacy in clearing and recycle toxic aggregated proteins and damaged cellular organelles due to impairment in the autophagy pathway. This dysfunction in autophagy characterized by the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates leads to a progressive loss in structural integrity/functionality of neurons and may even result in neuronal death. In recent years TFEB, a key regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, has received considerable attention. It has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in numerous neurodegenerative disorders like AD and PD. In various neurobiology studies involving animal models, TFEB has been found to ameliorate neurotoxicity and rescue neurodegeneration. Since TFEB is a master transcriptional regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis pathway and plays a crucial role in defining autophagy activation. Studies have been done to understand the mechanisms for TFEB dysfunction, which may yield insights into how TFEB might be targeted and used for the therapeutic strategy to develop a treatment process with extensive application to neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we explore the role of different transcription factor-based targeted therapy by some natural compounds for AD and PD with special emphasis on TFEB.",

Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS-2) is one of the most reliable tools for measuring sleep difficulties in people with Parkinson's disease. This study investigated the psychometric properties of the Persian version of PDSS-2.\nFour hundred and fifty-six people with Parkinson's disease with a mean age \u00b1standard deviation of 60.7\u2009\u00b1\u200911.3 years were engaged in this study. Acceptability was assessed by floor and ceiling effects. Dimensionality was measured by exploratory factor analysis. The convergent validity of PDSS-2 with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was assessed. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were assessed with Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), respectively.\nNo noticeable ceiling and floor effect was detected. The dimensionality analysis showed three factors. A high correlation was obtained between PDSS-2 and HADS (anxiety subscale). Excellent internal consistency with \nThis study showed that the Persian version of Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale has acceptable validity and reliability for measuring sleep disturbances in people with Parkinson's disease.",

At the early stage of the disease, only a subset of individuals with PD progress quickly, while the majority have a slowly progressive form of the disease. In developing treatments that aim to slow PD progression, clinical trials aim to include individuals who are likely to progress faster, such that a treatment effect, if one exists, can be identified easier and earlier. The aim of the present study was to identify baseline predictors of clinical progression in early PD. We analyzed 12-month data acquired from the PASADENA trial Part 1 (NCT03100149, ",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) form a continuum that may explain multiple aspects of age-related neurodegeneration. Inflammaging, the long-term result of the chronic physiological stimulation of the innate immune system, is integral to this process. The gut microbiome plays an important role in inflammaging, as it can release inflammatory products and communicate with other organs and systems. Although AD and PD are molecularly and clinically distinct disorders, their causes appear to underlie LBD. All three conditions lie on a continuum related to AD, PD, or LBD in vulnerable persons. Inflammation in AD is linked to cytokines and growth factors. Moreover, cytokines and neurotrophins profoundly affect PD and LBD. Growth factors, neurotrophins and cytokines are also involved in embryo neural development. Cytokines influence gene expression, metabolism, cell stress, and apoptosis in the preimplantation embryo. The responsible genes are silenced around birth. But if activated by inflammaging and viruses in the brain decades later, they could destroy the same neural structures they created in utero. For this reason, the pathology and progression of AD, LBD, and PD would be unique. Embryonic reactivation could explain two well documented features of AD. 1) NSAIDs reduce AD risk but fail as a treatment. 2) NSAIDs reduce AD risk because they suppress inflammaging. But they are not a treatment because they cannot silence the embryonic genes that have become active and damage the brain.",

    "abstract": "Up to one-third of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience visual hallucinations (VHs). Lewy bodies are sparse in the visual cortices and seem unlikely to explain the hallucinations. Some neuroimaging studies have found that perfusion is reduced in the occipital lobe in individuals with VHs. Recent work has suggested that decreased cholinergic input may directly lead to the decreased perfusion. The investigators hypothesized that individuals with PD and VHs would have biochemical evidence of reduced microvascular perfusion and reduced cholinergic activity in areas of the brain that process visual images.\nTissue from Brodmann's area (BA) 18 and BA 19 was obtained from a well-characterized cohort matched for age, gender, and postmortem interval in 69 individuals (PD without VHs, N=11; PD without dementia plus VHs N=10, N=10; PD with dementia plus VHs, N=16; and control subjects, N=32). Von Willebrand factor, vascular endothelial growth factor A, and myelin-associated glycoprotein:proteolipid protein-1 (MAG:PLP1) ratio-a measure of tissue oxygenation relative to metabolic demand, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), choline acetyltransferase, and \u03b1-synuclein-were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The primary outcome was the MAG:PLP1 ratio.\nThere was no biochemical evidence of chronic hypoperfusion in PD, although microvessel density was decreased in ventral BA 18 and BA 19. There was no between-group difference in BChE in either dorsal BA 18 or BA 19. AChE concentration was reduced in individuals with PD compared with control subjects in dorsal and ventral BA 18 and dorsal BA 19, and it was increased in ventral BA 19. These changes were most marked in the PD plus VHs group.\nThese results suggest that changes in cholinergic activity rather than chronic hypoperfusion may underlie VHs in PD.",

    "abstract": "External cues improve walking by evoking internal rhythm formation related to gait in the brain in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). This study examined the usefulness of using a portable gait rhythmogram (PGR) in music therapy on PD-related gait disturbance. A total of 19 subjects with PD who exhibited gait disturbance were evaluated for gait speed and step length during a 10 m straight walking task. Moreover, acceleration, cadence, and trajectory of the center of the body were estimated using a PGR. Walking tasks were created while incorporating music intervention that gradually increased in tempo from 90 to 120 beats per minute (BPM). We then evaluated whether immediate improvement in gait could be recognized even without music after walking tasks by comparing pre- (pre-MT) and post-music therapy (post-MT) values. Post-MT gait showed significant improvement in acceleration, gait speed, cadence, and step length. During transitions throughout the walking tasks, acceleration, gait speed, cadence, and step length gradually increased in tasks with music. With regard to the trajectory of the center of the body, we recognized a reduction in post-MT medio-lateral amplitude. Music therapy immediately improved gait disturbance in patients with PD, and the effectiveness was objectively shown using PGR.",

    "abstract": "The use of wearable sensors allows continuous recordings of physical activity from participants in free-living or at-home clinical studies. The large amount of data collected demands automatic analysis pipelines to extract gait parameters that can be used as clinical endpoints. We introduce a deep learning-based automatic pipeline for wearables that processes tri-axial accelerometry data and extracts gait events-bout segmentation, initial contact (IC), and final contact (FC)-from a single sensor located at either the lower back (near L5), shin or wrist. The gait events detected are posteriorly used for gait parameter estimation, such as step time, length, and symmetry. We report results from a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on a pilot study dataset of five participants clinically diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) and six healthy controls (HC). Participants wore sensors at three body locations and walked on a pressure-sensing walkway to obtain reference gait data. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for the IC events ranged from 22.82 to 33.09 milliseconds (msecs) for the lower back sensor while for the shin and wrist sensors, MAE ranges were 28.56-64.66 and 40.19-72.50 msecs, respectively. For the FC-event detection, MAE ranges were 29.06-48.42, 40.19-72.70 and 36.06-60.18 msecs for the lumbar, wrist and shin sensors, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC(2,k), between the estimated parameters and the reference data resulted in good-to-excellent agreement (ICC \u2265 0.84) for the lumbar and shin sensors, excluding the double support time (ICC = 0.37 lumbar and 0.38 shin) and swing time (ICC = 0.55 lumbar and 0.59 shin). The wrist sensor also showed good agreements, but the ICCs were lower overall than for the other two sensors. Our proposed analysis pipeline has the potential to extract up to 100 gait-related parameters, and we expect our contribution will further support developments in the fields of wearable sensors, digital health, and remote monitoring in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Among the cognitive domains impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD), social cognition has received particular attention in recent years. Nevertheless, attributional bias, a social-cognitive subdomain, has not yet been studied in this population, despite its potential relationship with neuropsychiatric symptoms, and despite the possibility that deep-brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, an effective treatment for disabling motor symptoms, worsens cognitive impairment. The present study therefore compared the attributional bias of patients with PD (stimulated and nonstimulated subgroups) with that of controls. It also explored the potential correlations between patients' attributional bias and their clinical scores.\nThirty-two patients with PD (12 stimulated and 20 nonstimulated) were recruited and matched with 32 healthy controls. Attributional bias was assessed using the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire, which yields three subscores: Hostility Bias, Aggression Bias, and Blame. Depressive symptoms (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression), paranoid thoughts (Paranoia Scale), global cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), and social functioning (Social Functioning Questionnaire) were also assessed.\nPatients exhibited more hostile and aggressive biases than controls, especially in ambiguous situations. Stimulated patients had greater hostility and aggression biases and a higher blame score than controls in accidental situations. No significant differences were observed between stimulated and nonstimulated patients.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to have assessed attributional bias in patients with PD and explored the impact of deep-brain stimulation on this particular subdomain of social cognition. Results suggest that patients exhibit attributional bias, and this impairment may be exacerbated in stimulated patients.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD) leads to substantial disability. Unlike external manifestations such as tremor, the decay of cognitive function is often an underlying process, and its neuroanatomic substrates are not yet fully elucidated. Knowledge regarding cognitive-related alterations in white matter (WM) pathways helps us understand the mechanisms of cognitive decline in patients with PD. Previous voxel-based analyses with Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) have uncovered white matter differences in groupwise, but the conclusions were inconsistent. That was partially due to white matter fibers that are known to affect cognition, such as the corpus callosum (CC) and superior longitudinal fasciculus that cross in voxel, and are hard to interpreted by the abovementioned metrics. Furthermore, cognitive decay is a continuous process, it is difficult to reflect the continuous changes of white matter fibers between groups comparison. In the present work, we chose the constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) and the fixel model, which avoided the effect of crossing fibers. To compare the white matter fiber in different cognitive stages of patients with PD, the results found that the CC, the cingulum bundle (CB), and the corticospinal tract (CST) showed the same trend in the decline of cognitive function, and this change may lead to the impairment of cognitive function. Our findings can help physicians determine the cognitive stage of PD from the perspective of white matter fiber and provide a reference for clinical trials and predictions.",

We sought to determine the effect of sex on the relationship between APOE4 status and incident cognitive decline in PD.\nData from the prospectively collected longitudinal National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set (UDS) and Neuropathology Data Set (NDS) were analyzed.

Further details may be found at the NACC web site (www.alz.washington.edu). The visit at which diagnosis of PD was made was termed the baseline visit. All patients with a PD diagnosis but without dementia at the baseline visit were included in the analyses.\nPresence of APOE4 allele was associated with higher odds (OR = 7.4; \nAPOE4 allele status in PD may be a predictor of cognitive decline in PD but does not appear to be modified by sex.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex, multisystem disorder characterised by \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA) pathology, degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, multifactorial pathogenetic mechanisms and expression of a plethora of motor and non-motor symptoms. Animal models of PD have already been instructive in helping us unravel some of these aspects. However, much remains to be discovered, requiring continued interrogation by the research community. In contrast with the situation for many neurological disorders, PD benefits from of a wide range of available animal models (pharmacological, toxin, genetic and \u03b1-synuclein) but this makes selection of the optimal one for a given study difficult. This is especially so when a study demands a model that displays a specific combination of features. While many excellent reviews of animal models already exist, this review takes a different approach with the intention of more readily informing this decision-making process. We have considered each feature of PD in turn - aetiology, pathology, pathogenesis, motor dysfunctions and non-motor symptoms (NMS) - highlighting those animal models that replicate each. By compiling easily accessible tables and a summary figure, we aim to provide the reader with a simple, go-to resource for selecting the optimal animal model of PD to suit their research needs.",

    "abstract": "There has been growing interest in potential roles of the immune system in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD). The aim of the current study was to comprehensively characterize phenotypic and functional profiles of circulating immune cells in patients with PD vs controls.\nPeripheral blood was collected from patients with PD and age- and sex-matched neurologically normal controls (NCs) in 2 independent cohorts (discovery and validation). Comprehensive multicolor flow cytometry was performed on whole blood leukocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to characterize different immune subsets and their ex vivo responses.\nThe discovery cohort included 17 NCs and 12 participants with PD, and the validation cohort included 18 NCs and 18 participants with PD. Among major immune cell types, B cells appeared to be preferentially affected in PD. Proliferating B cell counts were decreased in patients with PD compared with controls. Proportions of B-cell subsets with regulatory capacity such as transitional B cells were preferentially reduced in the patients with PD, whereas proportions of proinflammatory cytokine-producing B cells increased, resulting in a proinflammatory shift of their B-cell functional cytokine responses. Unsupervised principal component analysis revealed increased expression of TNF\u03b1 and GM-CSF by both B cells and T cells of patients with PD. In addition, levels of follicular T cells, an important B-cell helper T-cell population, decreased in the patients with PD, correlating with their B-cell abnormality.\nOur findings define a novel signature of peripheral immune cells and implicate aberrant Tfh:B-cell interactions in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "To shed light on the association between restless leg syndrome (RLS) and anxiety in Parkinson's disease (PD) population.\nThis was a case-control study including 129 PD participants with and without anxiety who presented to the Aerospace Center Hospital in Beijing, China. Anxiety was evaluated by using the Beck Anxiety Index score. RLS was assessed using the minimal diagnostic criteria of the International Restless Legs Study Group and RLS symptom frequency and treatment. We then examined the relationship between RLS and anxiety by logistic regression models and subgroup as well as interaction analyses.\nThe proportion of RLS in PD with anxiety was significantly higher in the PD without anxiety (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The multivariate logistic regression models indicated that PD participants with RLS had a 5.98-fold higher risk of anxiety in PD than those without RLS (OR, 6.98; 95% CI, 2.77-17.59). Subgroup analyses indicated that PD with RLS tended to be associated with a greater risk of anxiety in all stratified subgroups (adjusted ORs >1). Furthermore, the interaction analyses revealed no interactive role in the association between RLS and anxiety.\nThe present case-control study suggests that RLS is an independent risk factor for anxiety in PD patients. Early attention and targeted treatment for RLS may be necessary for mood management in PD. Larger prospective cohort studies are wanted to validate these findings.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with gut dysbiosis. However, whether gut dysbiosis can cause motor complications is unclear.\nSubjects were enrolled from four independent movement disorder centers in Japan. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis of gut microbiota. Relative abundance of gut microbiota and relationships between them and clinical characteristics were statistically analyzed. Analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) was used to assess altered gut microbiota associated with wearing-off or dyskinesia.\nWe enrolled 223 patients with PD. Wearing-off was noted in 47.5% of patients and dyskinesia in 21.9%. We detected 98 genera of bacteria. Some changes in the gut microbiota were observed in patients with PD and motor complications. After Bonferroni correction, patients with wearing-off showed decreased relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae Blautia (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and increased relative abundance of Lactobacillaceae Lactobacillus (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), but patients with dyskinesia no longer showed significant changes in the gut microbiota. Adjustment with two models of confounding factors followed by ANCOVA revealed that age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), disease duration (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and wearing-off (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0004) were independent risks for the decreased relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae Blautia, and wearing-off (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) was the only independent risk factor for the increased relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae Lactobacillus.\nRelative abundance of Lachnospiraceae Blautia and Lactobacillaceae Lactobacillus was significantly decreased and increased, respectively, in the gut microbiota of PD patients with motor complications. This indicates that an altered gut microbiota is associated with the development of motor complications in patients with advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) may take decades to develop, during which many risk or protective factors may come into play to initiate the pathogenesis or modify its progression to clinical PD. The lack of understanding of this prodromal phase of PD and the factors involved has been a major hurdle in the study of PD etiology and preventive strategies. Although still controversial, the Braak and dual-hit hypotheses that PD may start peripherally in the olfactory structures and/or the gut provides a theoretical platform to identify the triggers and modifiers of PD prodromal development and progression. This is particularly true for the search of environmental causes of PD as the olfactory structures and gut are the major human mucosal interfaces with the environment. In this review, we lay out our personal views about how the Braak and dual-hit hypotheses may help us search for the environmental triggers and modifiers for PD, summarize available experimental and epidemiological evidence, and discuss research gaps and strategies.",

    "abstract": "Our previous investigation showed Wnt signal pathway was significantly activated during DA neuron differentiation of epiblast-derived stem cells. In this study, we next attempt to examine the therapeutic potential of the purified exosomes derived bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) by administrating exosomes into the rat striatum of parkinson's disease (PD) animal model. Results revealed that the protein levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the substantia nigra of PD rats were down regulated after injection of BMSC induced-Exosomes into the striatum of PD model compared to BMSC quiescent-Exosomes. In addition, the expression of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) mRNA was significantly decreased, while the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA was increased after injection of BMSC induced-Exosomes. Injection of BMSC induced-Exosomes into the striatum rescued the rotation behavior and climbing speed in the PD rats. More importantly, Wnt5a was found to be enriched in BMSC induced Exosomes, which could be effectively transferred to the substantia nigra of PD rats. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that exosomes isolated during dopaminergic neuron differentiation could rescue the pathogenic features of Parkinson's disease by reshaping the inflammatory microenvironment in the substantia nigra and repairing the injury to DA nerves.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein aggregates are the hallmark pathology of Parkinson's disease, which can propagate in a stereotypical pattern along the brain-body axis. Parkinson's disease patients not only display heterogeneous symptoms but also show variable patterns of alpha-synuclein pathology and affected neuronal systems during the disease course, complicating early and accurate diagnosis. Emerging data from post-mortem and imaging studies strongly suggest that disease heterogeneity could, at least in part, be explained by variable disease onset site, i.e. brain or body. This has led to the recently hypothesized formulation of two Parkinson's disease-subtypes, a body-first subtype where pathogenic alpha-synuclein arises in the body and spreads to the brain, and a brain-first subtype where pathogenic alpha-synuclein arises in the brain and spreads to the body. From a preclinical perspective, several animal models have been adapted or developed to reproduce Parkinson's disease-like pathology in the brain or periphery aiming to address the site of disease onset. Here, we review the current rodent and primate models that aim to reproduce Parkinson's disease pathology development and spreading in the brain and/or body and discuss the value and shortcomings of these models for the development of potential future applications in clinical trials and personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "One of the non-motor features of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) is sexual dysfunction (SD) which is under-recognized and, consequently, undertreated. This study aimed to evaluate SD in patients with IPD.\nThe study was conducted on 67 IPD patients; 30 healthy subjects with age and gender matching with the patients served as the control group. All participants were subjected to sexual function assessment using the Arabic version of Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), while the severity of IPD was assessed using the modified Hoehn and Yahr scoring scale and MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).\nThere were no statistically significant differences between patients with IPD and the control group regarding MMSE, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia. However, BDI scores were significantly higher in patients with IPD. The rate of SD among our patients was 64% compared to 30% in the control group. The total score and subscales of ASEX were significantly higher in IPD patients than in controls. SD showed a significant correlation with the severity of the IPD irrespective of other variables, including patient age, sex, disease duration, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, and dose of L-dopa.\nSD is a commonly underrated feature in patients with IPD; it should be investigated carefully as it is an important non-motor symptom that correlates with disease severity.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) management seeks to balance the benefits and harms of current medications and evolves as the disease progresses. The natural history of PD and associated patterns of treatment change were analyzed to identify unmet needs in treatment of PD symptoms.\nMedical charts of patients from clinics across the US diagnosed on or before June 30th, 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Index date was the first clinic visit, and the post-index period was through study end (June 30th, 2019). Outcomes included the frequency of therapy changes in the post-index period, reasons for therapy change, and adverse events (AE).\nPatients (n\u00a0=\u00a0203) at index were receiving levodopa-peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (PDDI) monotherapy (47%), dopaminergic agonist (DA) monotherapy (15%), monoamine oxidase B inhibitor (MAOBI) monotherapy (14%), or combination therapies. The percentage of patients in Hoehn-Yahr disease Stage 1-2 was 52% at index and 20% by the end of the study. Frequencies of motor, non-motor, and neuropsychiatric symptoms increased during the enrollment. Levodopa-PDDI monotherapy and levodopa-PDDI\u00a0+\u00a0MAOBI had the lowest rates of therapy changes. Symptom relapse was the most common reason for dose escalation, add-on, and dose reduction, whereas AEs were the most common reason for discontinuation and switching. Dose escalation, add-on, and forward switch were most likely to occur in the first 6\u00a0months of treatment.\nTherapy changes during the study period reflected the challenging and evolving management of PD as the disease progresses. New or add-on symptomatic treatments are needed that are well-tolerated and able to control PD symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used for the treatment of movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and essential tremor, and has shown clinical benefits in other brain disorders. A natural path for the improvement of this technique is to continuously observe the stimulation effects on patient symptoms and neurophysiological markers. This requires the evolution of conventional deep brain stimulators to bidirectional interfaces, able to record, process, store, and wirelessly communicate neural signals in a robust and reliable fashion. Here, we present the architecture, design, and first use of an implantable stimulation and sensing interface (AlphaDBS",

    "abstract": "Two hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD) are the widespread deposition of misfolded alpha-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) protein in the nervous system and loss of substantia nigra dopamine neurons. Recent research has suggested that \u03b1Syn aggregates in the enteric nervous system (ENS) lead to prodromal gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as constipation in PD, then propagating to the brain stem and eventually triggering neurodegeneration and motor symptoms. Additionally, whether the microbiome changes in PD contribute to the primary pathogenesis or, alternatively, are consequential to either the disease process or medication is still unclear. In this review, we discuss the possible roles of \u03b1Syn and microbiome changes in the GI system in PD and consider if and how the changes interact and contribute to the disease process and symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to explore the postural effect of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) in camptocormia. It is a retrospective case series of 7 Parkinson disease and camptocormia patients. Binaural monopolar GVS was administered. Main outcome variable was trunk forward flexion (TFF), assessed pre and immediately post GVS, and one month after. The TFF was assessed in the standing position, with open and closed eyes. The Berg balance scale was assessed before and 1 month after GVS. The TFF immediately after the GVS showed a reduction of 2.3 cm (p = 0.091) in the first reading, and after a 1-min stance (p = 0.025). Four of 5 patients maintained or even improved this effect a month after (p = 0.082). No changes in Berg balance scale were observed. Our results suggest an acute improvement in posture after one session of GVS, which significantly decreased TFF. Most of the results had a marginal significance due to small sample size.",

    "abstract": "Dysautonomia is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Most dysautonomic symptoms appear due to alterations in the peripheral nerves of the autonomic nervous system, including both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The degeneration of sympathetic nerve fibers and neurons leads to cardiovascular dysfunction, which is highly prevalent in PD patients. Cardiac alterations such as orthostatic hypotension, heart rate variability, modifications in cardiogram parameters and baroreflex dysfunction can appear in both the early and late stages of PD, worsening as the disease progresses. In PD patients it is generally found that parasympathetic activity is decreased, while sympathetic activity is increased. This situation gives rise to an imbalance of both tonicities which might, in turn, promote a higher risk of cardiac damage through tachycardia and vasoconstriction. Cardiovascular abnormalities can also appear as a side effect of PD treatment: L-DOPA can decrease blood pressure and aggravate orthostatic hypotension as a result of a negative inotropic effect on the heart. This unwanted side effect limits the therapeutic use of L-DOPA in geriatric patients with PD and can contribute to the number of hospital admissions. Therefore, it is essential to define the cardiac features related to PD for the monitorization of the heart condition in parkinsonian individuals. This information can allow the application of intervention strategies to improve the course of the disease and the proposition of new alternatives for its treatment to eliminate or reverse the motor and non-motor symptoms, especially in geriatric patients.",

    "abstract": "Dementia is one of the most disabling nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the risk factors contributing to its development remain unclear. To investigate genetic variants associated with dementia in PD, we performed microarray genotyping based on a customized platform utilizing variants identified in previous genetic studies. Microarray genotyping was performed in 313 PD patients with dementia, 321 PD patients without dementia, and 635 healthy controls. The primary analysis was performed using a multiple logistic regression model adjusted for age and sex. ",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex multifactorial disorder caused by the interplay of both genetic and non-genetic risk factors. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are one way to aggregate the effects of a large number of genetic variants upon the risk for a disease like PD in a single quantity. However, reassessment of the performance of a given PRS in independent data sets is a precondition for establishing the PRS as a valid tool to this end. We studied a previously proposed PRS for PD in a separate genetic data set, comprising 1914 PD cases and 4464 controls, and were able to replicate its ability to differentiate between cases and controls. We also assessed theoretically the prognostic value of the PD-PRS, i.e., its ability to predict the development of PD in later life for healthy individuals. As it turned out, the PD-PRS alone can be expected to perform poorly in this regard. Therefore, we conclude that the PD-PRS could serve as an important research tool, but that meaningful PRS-based prognosis of PD at an individual level is not feasible.",

    "abstract": "A six-month double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study was conducted to ascertain whether low-dose daily niacin supplementation would improve motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. A total of 47 PD patients were assigned to receive low-dose niacin or a placebo. At the end of the double-blind phase, all participants received open-label niacin for the next six months. All patients were evaluated at baseline, after six months, and after one year of treatment. The primary outcome measure was the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III) scores. Secondary outcome measures were depression, sleep quality, mental flexibility and cognition, and physical fatigue. Niacin treatment was well-tolerated by forty-five subjects. The mean [95% CI] change in UPDRS III scores at six months of placebo was -0.05 [95% CI, -2.4 to 2.32], and niacin was -1.06 [95% CI, -3.68 to 1.57]. From six to twelve months when both groups received open-label niacin supplementation, the average UPDRS III scores significantly decreased for the placebo group by 4.58 [95% CI, -0.85 to 8.30] and the niacin group by 4.63 [95% CI, 1.42 to 7.83] points. Low-dose niacin supplementation is a well-tolerated adjunct therapy and may improve motor function in PD when taken over a longer period.",

    "abstract": "Progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, immune activation, and \u03b1-synuclein pathology characterize Parkinson's disease (PD). We previously reported that unilateral intranigral injection of recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors encoding wild-type human \u03b1-synuclein produced a rat model of early PD with dopamine terminal dysfunction. Here we tested the hypothesis that decreases in dopamine result in increased postsynaptic dopamine D2/D3 receptor expression, neuroinflammation, and reduced synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) density. Rats were injected with rAAV encoding \u03b1-synuclein or green fluorescent protein and subjected to non-pharmacological motor tests, before euthanization at 12 weeks post-injection. We performed: (1) in situ hybridization of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA, (2) HPLC of striatal dopamine content, and (3) autoradiography with [",

    "abstract": "The SNCA (Synuclein Alpha) gene represents a major risk gene for Parkinson's disease (PD) and SNCA polymorphisms have been associated with the common sporadic form of PD. Numerous Genome-Wide Association Studies showed strong signals located in the SNCA 3' UTR (untranslated region) region indicating that variants in 3' UTRs of PD-associated genes could contribute to neurodegeneration and may regulate the risk for PD. Genetic variants in 3' UTR can affect miRNA activity and consequently change the translation process. The aim of this study was to access the differences in 3' UTR variants of SNCA genes in a cohort of PD patients and control subjects from Croatia. The cohort consisted of 52 PD patients and 23 healthy control subjects. Differences between 3' UTR allele and genotype frequencies were accessed through next generation sequencing approach from whole blood samples. In our study, we identified four previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one insertion in the 3' UTR region of SNCA gene, namely rs1045722, rs3857053, rs577490090, rs356165, and rs777296100, and five variants not reported in the literature, namely rs35270750, rs529553259, rs377356638, rs571454522, and rs750347645. Our results indicate a significantly higher occurrence of the rs571454522 variant in the PD population. To the best of our knowledge, this variant has not been reported until now in the literature. We analyzed our results in the context of previous research, creating a brief overview of the importance of 3' UTR variants of the SNCA gene. Further studies will be needed to gain a more profound insight regarding their role in PD development, which will help to assess the role and impact of post-transcriptional regulation on disease pathology.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder associated with dopamine neuron loss and motor dysfunction. Neuroprotective agents that prevent dopamine neuron death hold great promise for slowing the disease's progression. The activation of cannabinoid (CB) receptors has shown neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of neurodegenerative disease, traumatic brain injury, and stroke, and may provide neuroprotection against PD. Here, we report that the selective CB2 agonist GW842166x exerted protective effects against the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced loss of dopamine neurons and its associated motor function deficits in mice, as shown by an improvement in balance beam walking, pole, grip strength, rotarod, and amphetamine-induced rotation tests. The neuroprotective effects of GW842166x were prevented by the CB2 receptor antagonist AM630, suggesting a CB2-dependent mechanism. To investigate potential mechanisms for the neuroprotective effects of GW842166x, we performed electrophysiological recordings from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons in ex vivo midbrain slices prepared from drug-na\u00efve mice. We found that the bath application of GW842166x led to a decrease in action potential firing, likely due to a decrease in hyperpolarization-activated currents (I",

    "abstract": "Cellular quality control systems have gained much attention in recent decades. Among these, autophagy is a natural self-preservation mechanism that continuously eliminates toxic cellular components and acts as an anti-ageing process. It is vital for cell survival and to preserve homeostasis. Several cell-type-dependent canonical or non-canonical autophagy pathways have been reported showing varying degrees of selectivity with regard to the substrates targeted. Here, we provide an updated review of the autophagy machinery and discuss the role of various forms of autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on Parkinson's disease. We describe recent findings that have led to the proposal of therapeutic strategies targeting autophagy to alter the course of Parkinson's disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a widespread severe neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by pronounced deficiency of the dopaminergic system and disruption of the function of other neuromodulator systems. Although heritable genetic factors contribute significantly to PD pathogenesis, only a small percentage of sporadic cases of PD can be explained using known genetic risk factors. Due to that, it could be inferred that changes in gene expression could be important for explaining a significant percentage of PD cases. One of the ways to investigate such changes, while minimizing the effect of genetic factors on experiment, are the study of PD discordant monozygotic twins. In the course of the analysis of transcriptome data obtained from IPSC and NPCs, 20 and 1906 differentially expressed genes were identified respectively. We have observed an overexpression of ",

    "abstract": "Established disease models have helped unravel the mechanistic underpinnings of pathological phenotypes in Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. However, these discoveries have been limited to relatively simple cellular systems and animal models, which typically manifest with incomplete or imperfect recapitulation of disease phenotypes. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has provided a powerful scientific tool for investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms of both familial and sporadic PD within disease-relevant cell types and patient-specific genetic backgrounds. Overwhelming evidence supports mitochondrial dysfunction as a central feature in PD pathophysiology, and iPSC-based neuronal models have expanded our understanding of mitochondrial dynamics in the development and progression of this devastating disorder. The present review provides a comprehensive assessment of mitochondrial phenotypes reported in iPSC-derived neurons generated from PD patients' somatic cells, with an emphasis on the role of mitochondrial respiration, morphology, and trafficking, as well as mitophagy and calcium handling in health and disease. Furthermore, we summarize the distinguishing characteristics of vulnerable midbrain dopaminergic neurons in PD and report the unique advantages and challenges of iPSC disease modeling at present, and for future mechanistic and therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is mainly characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Together with the small number, the high vulnerability of the dopaminergic neurons is a major pathogenic culprit of Parkinson's disease. Our previous findings of a higher survival of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra co-expressing Nogo-A in an animal model of Parkinson's disease suggested that Nogo-A may be associated with dopaminergic neurons resilience against Parkinson's disease neurodegeneration. In the present study, we have addressed the expression of Nogo-A in the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in postmortem specimens of diseased and non-diseased subjects of different ages. For this purpose, in a collaborative effort we developed a tissue micro array (TMA) that allows for simultaneous staining of many samples in a single run. Interestingly, and in contrast to the observations gathered during normal aging and in the animal model of Parkinson's disease, increasing age was significantly associated with a lower co-expression of Nogo-A in nigral dopaminergic neurons of patients with Parkinson's disease. In sum, while Nogo-A expression in dopaminergic neurons is higher with increasing age, the opposite is the case in Parkinson's disease. These observations suggest that Nogo-A might play a substantial role in the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Diplopia is relatively common in Parkinson's disease (PD) but is still understudied. Our aim was to analyze the frequency of diplopia in PD patients from a multicenter Spanish cohort, to compare the frequency with a control group, and to identify factors associated with it.\nPD patients who were recruited from January 2016 to November 2017 (baseline visit; V0) and evaluated again at a 2-year \u00b1 30 days follow-up (V2) from 35 centers of Spain from the COPPADIS cohort were included in this longitudinal prospective study. The patients and controls were classified as \"with diplopia\" or \"without diplopia\" according to item 15 of the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) at V0, V1 (1-year \u00b1 15 days), and V2 for the patients and at V0 and V2 for the controls.\nThe frequency of diplopia in the PD patients was 13.6% (94/691) at V0 (1.9% in controls [4/206]; \nDiplopia represents a frequent symptom in PD patients and is associated with motor and non-motor severity.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that has a significant impact on people's lives. Early diagnosis is imperative since proper treatment stops the disease's progression. With the rapid development of CAD techniques, there have been numerous applications of computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) techniques in the diagnosis of PD. In recent years, image fusion has been applied in various fields and is valuable in medical diagnosis. This paper mainly adopts a multi-focus image fusion method primarily based on deep convolutional neural networks to fuse magnetic resonance images (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) neural photographs into multi-modal images. Additionally, the study selected Alexnet, Densenet, ResNeSt, and Efficientnet neural networks to classify the single-modal MRI dataset and the multi-modal dataset. The test accuracy rates of the single-modal MRI dataset are 83.31%, 87.76%, 86.37%, and 86.44% on the Alexnet, Densenet, ResNeSt, and Efficientnet, respectively. Moreover, the test accuracy rates of the multi-modal fusion dataset on the Alexnet, Densenet, ResNeSt, and Efficientnet are 90.52%, 97.19%, 94.15%, and 93.39%. As per all four networks discussed above, it can be concluded that the test results for the multi-modal dataset are better than those for the single-modal MRI dataset. The experimental results showed that the multi-focus image fusion method according to deep learning can enhance the accuracy of PD image classification.",

    "abstract": "As a neurodegenerative disease, Parkinson's disease (PD) is hard to identify at the early stage, while using speech data to build a machine learning diagnosis model has proved effective in its early diagnosis. However, speech data show high degrees of redundancy, repetition, and unnecessary noise, which influence the accuracy of diagnosis results. Although feature reduction (FR) could alleviate this issue, the traditional FR is one-sided (traditional feature extraction could construct high-quality features without feature preference, while traditional feature selection could achieve feature preference but could not construct high-quality features). To address this issue, the Hierarchical Boosting Dual-Stage Feature Reduction Ensemble Model (HBD-SFREM) is proposed in this paper. The major contributions of HBD-SFREM are as follows: (1) The instance space of the deep hierarchy is built by an iterative deep extraction mechanism. (2) The manifold features extraction method embeds the nearest neighbor feature preference method to form the dual-stage feature reduction pair. (3) The dual-stage feature reduction pair is iteratively performed by the AdaBoost mechanism to obtain instances features with higher quality, thus achieving a substantial improvement in model recognition accuracy. (4) The deep hierarchy instance space is integrated into the original instance space to improve the generalization of the algorithm. Three PD speech datasets and a self-collected dataset are used to test HBD-SFREM in this paper. Compared with other FR algorithms and deep learning algorithms, the accuracy of HBD-SFREM in PD speech recognition is improved significantly and would not be affected by a small sample dataset. Thus, HBD-SFREM could give a reference for other related studies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease affecting more than 1% of the population over 65 years old. The etiology of the disease is unknown and there are only symptomatic managements available with no known disease-modifying treatment. Aging, genes, and environmental factors contribute to PD development and key players involved in the pathophysiology of the disease include oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagic-lysosomal imbalance, and neuroinflammation. Recent epidemiology studies have shown that type-2 diabetes (T2DM) not only increased the risk for PD, but also is associated with PD clinical severity. A higher rate of insulin resistance has been reported in PD patients and is suggested to be a pathologic driver in this disease. Oral diabetic drugs including sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have been shown to provide neuroprotective effects in both PD patients and experimental models; additionally, antidiabetic drugs have been demonstrated to lower incidence rates of PD in DM patients. Among these, the most recently developed drugs, SGLT2 inhibitors may provide neuroprotective effects through improving mitochondrial function and antioxidative effects. In this article, we will discuss the involvement of mitochondrial-related oxidative stress in the development of PD and potential benefits provided by antidiabetic agents especially focusing on sglt2 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected the daily life of the worldwide population since 2020. Links between the newly discovered viral infection and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases have been investigated in different studies. This review aims to summarize the literature concerning COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease (PD) to give an overview on the interface between viral infection and neurodegeneration with regard to this current topic. We will highlight SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, neuropathology and the suspected pathophysiological links between the infection and neurodegeneration as well as the psychosocial impact of the pandemic on patients with PD. Some evidence discussed in this review suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic might be followed by a higher incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in the future. However, the data generated so far are not sufficient to confirm that COVID-19 can trigger or accelerate neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "For persons with Parkinson's disease, the loss of autonomy in daily life leads to a high level of dependency on relatives' support. Such dependency strongly correlates with high levels of perceived stress and psychosocial burden in informal caregivers. Global developments, such as demographic change and the associated thinning infrastructure in rural areas cause a continuously growing need for medical and nursing care. However, this need is not being adequately met. The resulting care gap is being made up by unpaid or underpaid work of informal caregivers. The double burden of care work and gainful employment creates enormous health-related impairments of the informal caregivers, so that they eventually become invisible patients themselves. Expectedly, those invisible patients do not receive the best care, leading to a decrease in quality of life and, in the end, to worse care for PD patients. Suggested solutions to relieve relatives, such as moving the person affected by Parkinson's to a nursing home, often do not meet the wishes of patients and informal caregivers, nor does it appear as a structural solution in the light of demographic change against an economic background. Rather, it requires the development, implementation and evaluation of new, holistic approaches to care that make invisible patients visible.",

    "abstract": "Postural abnormalities are common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and lead to gait abnormalities. Relationships between changes in the trunk posture of PD patients and gait profile score (GPS) and gait spatiotemporal parameters are poorly investigated. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationships between trunk posture, GPS, and gait spatiotemporal parameters, in patients with PD.\nTwenty-three people with PD and nineteen age-matched healthy people participated in this study. A 3D gait kinematical analysis was applied to all participants using the Plug-In Gait Full Body\nCadence, opposite foot off, step time, single support, double support, foot off, gait speed, trunk kinematics, and GPS showed significant differences between the two groups (\nFlexed posture of the trunk in patients with PD seems to influence both ankle and knee movement patterns during the gait. The GPS analysis provided direct and simplified kinematic information for the PD group. These results may have implications for understanding the importance of considering the positioning of the trunk during gait.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common and pivotal non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). It is necessary to use the appropriate tools to characterize the cognitive profiles and identify the subjects at risk of MCI in clinical practice. A cohort of 207 non-demented patients with PD and 52 age- and gender-matched cognitively normal controls (NCs) underwent the Chinese Version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-BC) evaluation. Patients with PD also received detailed motor and non-motor evaluation by serial scales. Cognitive profiles were investigated in patients with PD-MCI, relative to patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and cognitively NCs. In addition, differences in demography, major motor and non-motor symptoms were compared between patients with PD-MCI and PD-NC. There were 70 patients with PD-MCI, occupying 33.8% of the total patients. Patients with PD-MCI had impairment in multiple cognitive domains, especially in executive function, memory and visuospatial function on MoCA-BC, relative to cognitively NCs or PD-NC. Compared with PD-NC patients, PD-MCI patients were older (",

    "abstract": "Currently, there are no pharmacological treatments able to reverse nigral degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD), hence the unmet need for the provision of neuroprotective agents. Cannabis-derived phytocannabinoids (CDCs) and resveratrol (RSV) may be useful neuroprotective agents for PD due to their anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. To evaluate this, we undertook a systematic review of the scientific literature to assess the neuroprotective effects of CDCs and RSV treatments in pre-clinical in vivo animal models of PD. The literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science core collection were systematically searched to cover relevant studies. A total of 1034 publications were analyzed, of which 18 met the eligibility criteria for this review. Collectively, the majority of PD rodent studies demonstrated that treatment with CDCs or RSV produced a significant improvement in motor function and mitigated the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Biochemical analysis of rodent brain tissue suggested that neuroprotection was mediated by anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. This review highlights the neuroprotective potential of CDCs and RSV for in vivo models of PD and therefore suggests their potential translation to human clinical trials to either ameliorate PD progression and/or be implemented as a prophylactic means to reduce the risk of development of PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the COmedication Study assessing Mono- and cOmbination therapy with levodopa-carbidopa inteStinal gel (COSMOS) was to assess the use of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) as monotherapy in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (APD) in routine clinical practice. COSMOS was an international observational study with one cross-sectional visit and retrospective data collection. In Romania, 95 adult patients with APD on LCIG treatment for at least 12 months were enrolled and stratified according to their LCIG therapy after 12 months: monotherapy (without any add-on PD medication), monotherapy with night PD medication and LCIG + add-on medication. Compared to the moment of LCIG initiation, the percentage of patients on monotherapy increased at three months after LCIG initiation and remained constant up to 12 months, when 30.5% of the patients were on LCIG monotherapy and 11.6% were on monotherapy with night medication. \"Off\" time and \"On\" time with dyskinesia decreased from LCIG initiation to patient visit in all groups. LCIG monotherapy with or without night medication may provide a simplified treatment option for selected APD patients, with long-term efficacy similar to that of LCIG plus add-on medication.",

    "abstract": "Advanced Parkinson's disease (APD) has been recently defined as a stage in which certain symptoms and complications are present, with a detrimental influence on the overall patient's health conditions and with a poor response to conventional treatments. However, historically, the term APD has been controversial, thus consequently, APD prevalence has not been previously studied.\nThe main objective was to determine the prevalence of APD in patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD in hospitals of the Spanish National Healthcare System. Secondary objectives were the prevalence and incidence of PD and the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics and quality of life of patients with APD or non-APD.\nThis was a non-interventional, cross-sectional, multicenter, national study in the hospital setting.\nThe study population included 929 patients with PD (mean age 71.8 \u00b1 10.1 years; 53.8% male) and a mean time since diagnosis of 6.6 \u00b1 5.4 years. At the time of diagnosis, 613 patients (66.06%) reported having had premotor symptoms. The Hoehn and Yahr stage was 1 in 15.7% of the patients, 2 in 42.8%, 3 in 30.1%, 4 in 9.9%, and 5 in 1.4%; 46.9% of the patients had comorbidities (mean age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index 3.5 \u00b1 1.7; median 10-year survival 77%) and the mean 8-item Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire was 27.8 \u00b1 20.5. We found an APD prevalence of 38.21% (95%CI: 35.08-41.42%), a PD prevalence of 118.4 (95%CI: 117.3-119.6), and a PD incidence of 9.4 (95%CI: 5.42-13.4) all per 100,000 population. Among the APD population, a 15.2% were receiving some form of therapy for advanced stages of the disease (deep brain stimulation, levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel, or apomorphine subcutaneous infusion).\nThe percentage of patients with APD in the hospitals of the Spanish National Healthcare System was 38.2%.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the parkinson oscillation mechanism in a computational model by bifurcation analysis and numerical simulation. Oscillatory activities can be induced by abnormal coupling weights and delays. The bidirectional Hopf bifurcation phenomena are found in simulations, which can uniformly explain the oscillation mechanism in this model. The Hopf1 represents the transition between the low firing rate stable state (SS) and oscillation state (OS), the Hopf2 represents the transition between the high firing rate stable state (HSS) and the OS, the mechanisms of them are different. The Hopf1 and Hopf2 bifurcations both show that when the state transfers from the stable region to the oscillation region, oscillatory activities originate from the beta frequency band or the gamma frequency band. We find that the changing trends of the frequency (DF) and oscillation amplitude (OSAM) are contrary in many cases. The effect of the delay in inhibitory pathways is greater than that of in excitatory pathways, and appropriate delays improve the discharge activation level (DAL) of the system. In all, we infer that oscillations can be induced by the follow factors: 1. Improvement of the DAL of the globus pallidus externa (GPe); 2. Reduce the DAL of the GPe from the HSS or the discharge saturation state; 3. The GPe can also resonate with the subthalamic nucleus (STN).",

    "abstract": "In this study we investigate how \u03b2-catenin-dependent WNT signalling impacts midbrain dopaminergic neuron (mDA) specification. mDA cultures at day 65 of differentiation responded to 25 days of the tankyrase inhibitor XAV969 (XAV, 100nM) with reduced expression of markers of an A9 mDA phenotype (KCNJ6, ALDH1A1 and TH) but increased expression of the transcriptional repressors NR0B1 and NR0B2. Overexpression of NR0B1 and or NR0B2 promoted a loss of A9 dopaminergic neuron phenotype markers (KCNJ6, ALDH1A1 and TH). Overexpression of NR0B1, but not NR0B2 promoted a reduction in expression of the \u03b2-catenin-dependent WNT signalling pathway activator RSPO2. Analysis of Parkinson's disease (PD) transcriptomic databases shows a profound PD-associated elevation of NR0B1 as well as reduced transcript for RSPO2. We conclude that reduced \u03b2-catenin-dependent WNT signalling impacts dopaminergic neuron identity, in vitro, through increased expression of the transcriptional repressor, NR0B1. We also speculate that dopaminergic neuron regulatory mechanisms may be perturbed in PD and that this may have an impact upon both existing nigral neurons and also neural progenitors transplanted as PD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a common complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy. Nitric oxide in the central nervous system may have a role in its pathophysiology. The present work investigates plasma and CSF levels of nitric oxide metabolites nitrite and nitrate in patients with PD, LID, and healthy control. We measured plasma and CSF nitrite and nitrate levels in patients with PD with and without LID and in healthy controls. The levels of plasma and CSF nitrite and nitrate were measured by ozone-based chemiluminescence. Sixty-seven participants were enrolled. CSF nitrite levels in patients with PD and LID were higher than in patients with PD without LID and healthy controls. CSF/plasma ratio of nitrite was higher in patients with PD and LID than in patients with PD without LID. The CSF/plasma ratio of nitrite in patients with PD and LID was higher than 1, indicating an intrathecal production of NO in patients with this motor complication. There was an increase in nitrate levels of CSF and CSF/plasma ratio of nitrate in patients with PD and LID compared to the healthy controls. Sex, age at evaluation, disease duration, and levodopa equivalent daily doses, as well as processing and storage time, did not critically influence these results. The present study demonstrated an increase in nitrite and nitrate levels in the central nervous system of patients with PD and LID. This finding strengthens the role of NO on LID pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Differentiating between Parkinson's disease (PD) and the atypical Parkinsonian disorders of multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is difficult clinically due to overlapping symptomatology, especially at early disease stages. Consequently, there is a need to identify metabolic markers for these diseases and to develop them into viable biomarkers. In the present investigation, solution nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry metabolomics were used to quantitatively characterize the plasma metabolomes (a total of 167 metabolites) of a cohort of 94 individuals comprising 34 PD, 12 MSA, and 17 PSP patients, as well as 31 control subjects. The distinct and statistically significant differences observed in the metabolite concentrations of the different disease and control groups enabled the identification of potential plasma metabolite markers of each disorder and enabled the differentiation between the disorders. These group-specific differences further implicate disturbances in specific metabolic pathways. The two metabolites, formic acid and succinate, were altered similarly in all three disease groups when compared to the control group, where a reduced level of formic acid suggested an effect on pyruvate metabolism, methane metabolism, and/or the kynurenine pathway, and an increased succinate level suggested an effect on the citric acid cycle and mitochondrial dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "l-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), the dopamine precursor, remains the frontline treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). With the treatment progress, l-DOPA efficacy decreases, necessitating higher and more frequent doses, with higher risks of dyskinesia. l-DOPA chelates iron through its catechol group, forming the l-DOPA:Fe complex; however, the fate of this complex is unknown. Catechol siderophore-like compounds are known to bind siderocalin (Scn)/lipocalin-2 to form stable siderophore:Fe:Scn complexes. Scn is upregulated in PD patients' substantia nigra and may play a role in PD pathophysiology. Therefore, in this study, we used the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique to examine the binding properties of l-DOPA to Scn. We found that l-DOPA formed a stable complex with Scn in the presence of Fe",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common degenerative disease of the central nervous system. Although some drugs can alleviate the progress of PD, their long-term use will lead to complications, so it is still necessary to find new drugs to delay or cure PD effectively. In view of the difficulty in developing new drugs, it is imperative to discover new functions of existing compounds that could be used to treat PD. In this study, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was used to induce PD symptoms in a mouse model. Subsequently, these mice were treated with the antibiotic ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone alleviated the behavioural and neuropathological changes induced by MPTP, downregulated the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) as markers of astroglia and microglia, respectively, and reduced the expression of neuroinflammation-related Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), and phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa-B (p-NF-",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide reducing cognitive and motoric abilities of affected persons. Freezing of Gait (FoG) is one of the severe symptoms that is observed in the late stages of the disease and considerably impairs the mobility of the person and raises the risk of falls. Due to the pathology and heterogeneity of the Parkinsonian gait cycle, especially in the case of freezing episodes, the detection of the gait phases with wearables is challenging in Parkinson's disease. This is addressed by introducing a state-automaton-based algorithm for the detection of the foot's motion phases using a shoe-placed inertial sensor. Machine-learning-based methods are investigated to classify the actual motion phase as normal or FoG-affected and to predict the outcome for the next motion phase. For this purpose, spatio-temporal gait and signal parameters are determined from the segmented movement phases. In this context, inertial sensor fusion is applied to the foot's 3D acceleration and rate of turn. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and AdaBoost classifiers have been trained on the data of 16 Parkinson's patients who had shown FoG episodes during a clinical freezing-provoking assessment course. Two clinical experts rated the video-recorded trials and marked episodes with festination, shank trembling, shuffling, or akinesia. Motion phases inside such episodes were labeled as FoG-affected. The classifiers were evaluated using leave-one-patient-out cross-validation. No statistically significant differences could be observed between the different classifiers for FoG detection (",

    "abstract": "The relationship between the risk of Parkinson disease and well-water consumption has been extensively studied, but the results have been contradictory. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of observational studies to systematically assess the relationship between well-water consumption and Parkinson disease risk.\nWe followed the PRISMA checklist in completing the meta-analysis. We searched two electronic databases (PubMed, EBSCO, EMBASE and Cochrane) from establishment to October, 2021, to identify relevant studies linking well-water drinking to Parkinson risk. We used a random-effects model to calculate the overall odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). To reduce intragroup heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses according to the research design and geographic area.\nAfter careful review, a total of 15 case-control-designed studies included data suitable for our meta-analysis. The total number of cases and total controls that contribute to the combined OR were 2182 and 2456. The combined OR for ever well-water drinkers versus non-drinkers was 1.16 (95% CI: 0.97-1.39, I\nOur results indicate that there is no significant correlation between well-water consumption and PD risk.",

    "abstract": "Danon disease is typically associated with cardiomyopathy and ventricular pre-excitation. The study aimed to characterize the clinical profile of Danon disease, analyze electrocardiographic (ECG) and electrophysiologic features, and investigate their association with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and fasciculoventricular pathways (FVPs).\nClinical course, family history, ECG and electrophysiological data were collected from 16 patients with Danon disease. Over 0.4-8 years of follow up, 1 female patient died suddenly, and 5 male patients died of progressive heart failure by age 13-20 years. Family history analysis revealed that 3 mothers experienced hospitalization or death for heart failure at age 28-41 years. There was 100% penetrance for ECG abnormalities in 13 patients with original ECGs. Short PR intervals and delta waves were present in 9 and 8 patients, respectively. There were significant age-associated increases in the QRS complex width (r=0.556, P=0.048) and the number of leads with notched QRS (r=0.575, P=0.04). Four patients who underwent electrophysiological studies all had FVPs, and 2 of them still had left-side atrioventricular pathways.\nDanon disease causes a malignant clinical course characterized by early death caused by heart failure in both genders and progressive ECG changes as patients age. The pre-excited ECG pattern is related to FVPs and WPW, which is suggestive of extensive cardiac involvement.",

    "abstract": "Converging evidence suggests that intestinal inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies on fecal calprotectin in Parkinson's disease (PD) were limited by small sample sizes, and literature regarding intestinal inflammation in multiple system atrophy (MSA) is very scarce. We investigated the levels of fecal calprotectin, a marker of intestinal inflammation, in PD and MSA.\nWe recruited 169 subjects (71 PD, 38 MSA, and 60 age-similar nonneurological controls). Clinico-demographic data were collected. PD and MSA were subtyped and the severity assessed using the MDS-UPDRS and UMSARS, respectively. Fecal calprotectin and blood immune markers were analyzed.\nCompared to controls (median: 35.7 [IQR: 114.2] \u03bcg/g), fecal calprotectin was significantly elevated in PD (median: 95.6 [IQR: 162.1] \u03bcg/g, p = 0.003) and even higher in MSA (median: 129.5 [IQR: 373.8] \u03bcg/g, p = 0.002). A significant interaction effect with age was observed; between-group differences were significant only in older subjects (i.e., \u2265 61 years) and became more apparent with increasing age. A total of 28.9% of MSA and 18.3% of PD patients had highly abnormal fecal calprotectin levels (\u2265 250 \u03bcg/g); however, this difference was only significant for MSA compared to controls. Fecal calprotectin correlated moderately with selected blood immune markers in PD, but not with clinical features of PD or MSA.\ns Elevated fecal calprotectin suggests a role for intestinal inflammation in PD and MSA. A more complete understanding of gut immune alterations could open up new avenues of research and treatment for these debilitating diseases.",

    "abstract": "The loss of neuronal in the substantia nigra of the elderly contributes to striatal damage and plays a critical part in the common forms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease (PD). The deficit of dopamine is one of the most familiar neuropathological features of PD as well as \u03b1-Synuclein aggregation. The peripheral autonomic nervous system is also affected negatively during the course of the disease, although the subsistent of dyskinesias and else major motor characteristic deficits take significant role in the diagnostic methods during clinical practice, which is related to a number of non-motor symptoms that might increase aggregate risks. Multiple pathways and mechanisms are involved in the molecular pathogenesis: \u03b1-Synuclein, neuronal homeostasis, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, as well as neuroinflammation. Investigations in the last few years for diagnostic biomarkers used neuroimaging, including single photon emission computed tomography\u00a0 as well as cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging techniques, which has been presented to facilitate discrepant diagnosis. Pharmacological treatment is also important and efficient in equal measure. In addition to reliance on striatal dopamine replacement therapy, many solutions that are used for motor or nonmotor symptoms in these patients are available.",

    "abstract": "Despite our ageing populations, elderly patients are underrepresented in clinical research, and ageing research is often separate from that of Parkinson's disease (PD). To our knowledge, no previous study has focused on the most elderly ('old-old', age \u2265 85 years) patients with PD to reveal how age directly influences PD clinical progression.\nWe compared the clinical characteristics and pharmacological profiles, including complications of levodopa treatment, disease progression, disabilities, and comorbidities of the old-old with those of comparable younger ('young-old', age 60-75 years) PD patients. In addition, within the old-old group, we compared those with a short disease duration (< 10 years at the time of diagnosis) to those with a long disease duration \u226510 years to investigate whether prognosis was related to disease progression or aging.\nThis single-centre, case-control study compared 60 old-old to 92 young-old PD patients, matched for disease duration. Patients in the old-old group were also divided equally (30:30) into two subgroups (short and long disease duration) with the same mean age. We compared the groups based on several clinical measures using a conditional logistic regression.\nBy study design, there were no differences between age groups when comparing disease duration, however, the proportion of men decreased with age (p = 0.002). At a comparable length of PD duration of 10 years, the old-old PD patients predominantly had significantly greater postural instability and gait disturbance (p = 0.006), higher motor scope of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III, p<0.0001), and more advanced Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage (p<0.0001). The Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQuest) score was also significantly higher among the old-old (p<0.0001) compared to the young-old patients. Moreover, the distribution of NMS also differed between ages, with features of gastrointestinal problems (p<0.0001), urinary problems (p = 0.004), sleep disturbances and fatigue (p = 0.032), and cognitive impairment (p<0.0001) significantly more common in the old-old group, whereas sexual problems (p = 0.012), depression, and anxiety (p = 0.032) were more common in the young-old. No differences were found in visual hallucinations, cerebrovascular disease, and miscellaneous domains. While young-old PD patients received higher levodopa equivalent daily doses (p<0.0001) and developed a significant greater rate of dyskinesia (p = 0.002), no significant difference was observed in the rate of wearing-off (p = 0.378). Old-old patients also had greater disability, as measured by the Schwab and England scale (p<0.0001) and had greater milestone frequency specifically for dementia (p<0.0001), wheelchair placement (p<0.0001), nursing home placement (p = 0.019), and hospitalisation in the past 1 year (p = 0.05). Neither recurrent falls (p = 0.443) nor visual hallucinations (p = 0.607) were documented significantly more often in the old-old patients.\nAge and disease duration were independently associated with clinical presentation, course, and progression of PD. Age was the main predictor, but disease duration also had a strong effect, suggesting that factors of the ageing process beyond the disease process itself cause PD in the most elderly to be more severe.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant brain oscillations are a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology and may be related to both motor and nonmotor symptoms. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) affects many people with PD even at the time of diagnosis and conversion risks to PD dementia (PDD) are very high. Unfortunately, pharmacotherapies are not addressing cognitive symptoms in PD. Profiling PD cognitive phenotypes (e.g., MCI, PDD, etc.) may therefore help inform future treatments. Neurophysiological methods, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG), offer the advantage of observing oscillatory patterns, whose regional and temporal profiles may elucidate how cognitive changes relate to neural mechanisms. We conducted a resting-state MEG cross-sectional study of 89 persons with PD stratified into three phenotypic groups: normal cognition, MCI, and PDD, to identify brain regions and frequencies most associated with each cognitive profile. In addition, a neuropsychological battery was administered to assess each domain of cognition. Our data showed higher power in lower frequency bands (delta and theta) observed along with more severe cognitive impairment and associated with memory, language, attention, and global cognition. Of the total 119 brain parcels assessed during source analysis, widespread group differences were found in the beta band, with significant changes mostly occurring between the normal cognition and MCI groups. Moreover, bilateral frontal and left-hemispheric regions were particularly affected in the other frequencies as cognitive decline becomes more pronounced. Our results suggest that MCI and PDD may be qualitatively distinct cognitive phenotypes, and most dramatic changes seem to have happened when the PD brain shows mild cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown to reflect cognitive changes in early Parkinson's disease (PD) but the diffusion-based measure free water (FW) has not been previously assessed.\nTo assess if FW in the thalamic nuclei primarily involved with cognition (ie, the dorsomedial [DMN] and anterior [AN] nuclei), the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), and the hippocampus correlates with and is associated with longitudinal cognitive decline and distinguishes cognitive status at baseline in early PD. Also, to explore how FW compares with conventional DTI, FW-corrected DTI, and volumetric assessments for these outcomes.\nImaging data and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database were analyzed using partial correlations and ANCOVA. Primary outcome multiple comparisons were corrected for false discovery rate (q value).\nThalamic DMN FW changes over 1\u00a0year correlated with MoCA changes over both 1 and 3\u2009years (partial correlations -0.222, q\u2009=\u20090.040, n\u2009=\u2009130; and\u2009-\u20090.229, q\u2009=\u20090.040, n\u2009=\u2009123, respectively; mean PD duration at baseline\u2009=\u20096.85\u00a0months). NbM FW changes over 1\u2009year only correlated with MoCA changes over 3\u2009years (-0.222, q\u2009=\u20090.040). Baseline hippocampal FW was associated with cognitive impairment at 3\u2009years (q\u2009=\u20090.040) and baseline nbM FW distinguished PD-normal cognition (MoCA \u226526) from PD-cognitive impairment (MoCA \u226425), (q\u2009=\u20090.008). The exploratory comparisons showed FW to be the most robust assessment modality for all outcomes.\nThalamic DMN FW is a promising cognition progression biomarker in early PD that may assist in identifying cognition protective therapies in clinical trials. FW is a robust assessment modality for these outcomes. \u00a9 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Even though Parkinson's disease (PD) is typically viewed as largely affecting gray matter, there is growing evidence that there are also structural changes in the white matter. Traditional connectomics methods that study PD may not be specific to underlying microstructural changes, such as myelin loss.\nThe primary objective of this study is to investigate the PD-induced changes in myelin content in the connections emerging from the basal ganglia and the brainstem. For the weighting of the connectome, we used the longitudinal relaxation rate as a biologically grounded myelin-sensitive metric.\nWe computed the myelin-weighted connectome in 35 healthy control subjects and 81 patients with PD. We used partial least squares to highlight the differences between patients with PD and healthy control subjects. Then, a ring analysis was performed on selected brainstem and subcortical regions to evaluate each node's potential role as an epicenter for disease propagation. Then, we used behavioral partial least squares to relate the myelin alterations with clinical scores.\nMost connections (~80%) emerging from the basal ganglia showed a reduced myelin content. The connections emerging from potential epicentral nodes (substantia nigra, nucleus basalis of Meynert, amygdala, hippocampus, and midbrain) showed significant decrease in the longitudinal relaxation rate (P\u00a0<\u20090.05). This effect was not seen for the medulla and the pons.\nThe myelin-weighted connectome was able to identify alteration of the myelin content in PD in basal ganglia connections. This could provide a different view on the importance of myelination in neurodegeneration and disease progression. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder. It is also the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder and has more than doubled between 1990 and 2016. Parkinson's disease causes significant morbidity and disability from motor dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. This paper reviews recent evidence in the treatment of PD \"off\" episodes with the novel drug opicapone, including its efficacy, safety, and clinical indications. Opicapone is a novel, peripherally acting catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor used as adjunctive therapy to carbidopa/levodopa for treatment and prevention of \"off\" episodes. It has been approved for use as an adjunct to levodopa since 2016 in Europe and has recently (April 2020) gained FDA approval for use in the USA. By inhibiting COMT, opicapone slows levodopa metabolism and increases its availability. Several clinical studies demonstrated significant improvement in treatment efficacy and reduction in the duration of \"off\" episodes The main side effect demonstrated was dyskinesia, mostly with the 100 mg dose, which is higher than the approved, effective dose of 50 mg.",

    "abstract": "The composition of the intestinal flora of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) can change. However, whether reshaping the gut microbial composition can treat PD remains to be seen. The present study evaluated the effect of intestinal flora in the treatment of PD in a C57BL/6 mouse PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Chronic, low-dose, MPTP-treated mice exhibited upregulated gene expression levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in the substantia nigra (SN) of the mice, and induced intestinal microbial disorders. This indicated that the chronic low-dose MPTP model could be used to evaluate the progress of early intestinal pathology and intestinal flora imbalance in PD. After transplantation of faecal bacteria to MPTP-induced PD mice, the level of inflammation in the SN of the mice was reduced, and motor dysfunction was alleviated. Notably, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) upregulated the abundance of ",

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests nigral iron accumulation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), contributing to dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Converging evidence suggests this accumulation might be related to, or increased by, serotonergic dysfunction, a common, often early feature of the disease. We investigated whether lower plasma serotonin in PD is associated with higher nigral iron. We obtained plasma samples from 97 PD patients and 89 controls and MRI scans from a sub-cohort (62 PD, 70 controls). We measured serotonin concentrations using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and regional iron content using MRI-based quantitative susceptibility mapping. PD patients had lower plasma serotonin (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and higher nigral iron content (SNc: p\u2009<\u20090.001) overall. Exclusively in PD, lower plasma serotonin was correlated with higher nigral iron (SNc: r(58)\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.501, p\u2009<\u20090.001). This correlation was significant even in patients newly diagnosed (<\u20091\u00a0year) and stronger in the SNc than any other region examined. This study reveals an early, linear association between low serotonin and higher nigral iron in\u00a0PD patients, which is absent in controls. This is consistent with a serotonin-iron relationship in the disease process, warranting further studies to determine its cause and directionality.",

    "abstract": "Emotional states have been shown to influence cognitive processes including visual-spatial learning. Parkinson's Disease (PD), besides manifesting with the cardinal motor symptoms, presents cognitive and affective disturbances. Here we aimed at investigating whether manipulation of the emotional state by means of music was able to influence the performance of a visual-spatial learning task in a group of PD participants.\nTen PD patients and 11 healthy elderly (ELD) were asked to perform a visual-spatial learning task while listening two musical pieces evoking a neutral emotion or fear. Targets were presented on a screen in a preset order over four blocks and subjects were asked to learn the sequence order by attending to the display. At the end of each block, participants were asked to verbally recall the sequence and a score was assigned (Verbal Score, VS).\nAnalysis of variance-type statistic test on the VS disclosed a significant effect of Music and sequence Blocks (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively) and a significant interaction between Group and sequence Blocks. Sequence learning occurred across the training period in both groups, but PD patients were slower than ELD and at the end of the training period learning performance was worse in PD with respect to ELD. In PD patients, like in ELD, fear-inducing music has a detrimental effect on visual-spatial learning performances, which are slower and decreased.\nThese findings confirm an impairment in visual-spatial learning in PD and indicates that the emotional state influences this learning ability similarly to healthy controls.",

    "abstract": "To study clinical and epidemiological characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD) in Baku.\nThe authors retrospectively collected information on the newly diagnosed and all patients diagnosed with PD in outpatient clinics in Baku in 2010-2019. A prospective observation was carried out in the clinic of the Department of Neurology of the Azerbaijan Medical University in 2019, where 2% of patients diagnosed with PD, who were registered in the dispensary, respectively in 2010-2019 (a total of 125 patients), were hospitalized by random selection.\nThe trend in the dynamics of incidence (Y=0.4747x+7.0665; R\nIn Baku, there is a clearly expressed trend of growth in the incidence and prevalence of PD, the levels of which for 2010-2019 years fluctuated in the interval 7.4-12.0 and 101.4-110.6 per 100.000 population, respectively. The most noticeable clinical and epidemiological characteristic of PD in Baku is the prevalence of patients in the second stage of disease (37.5%) as well as males (59.4%).\n\u0418\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u044d\u043f\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 (\u0411\u041f) \u0432 \u0411\u0430\u043a\u0443.\n\u0420\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441 \u0411\u041f \u0432 \u0430\u043c\u0431\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e-\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0443\u0447\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u0411\u0430\u043a\u0443 \u0437\u0430 2010\u20142019 \u0433\u0433. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0431\u0434\u044e\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0432\u044b\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0437\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0444\u0435\u0434\u0440\u044b \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438 \u0410\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0432 2019 \u0433., \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0439\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043e\u0442\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e 2% \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0411\u041f, \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0445\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0432 2010\u20142019 \u0433\u0433.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative movement disorder that currently has no disease-modifying treatment, partly owing to inefficiencies in drug target identification and validation. We use Mendelian randomization to investigate over 3,000 genes that encode druggable proteins and predict their efficacy as drug targets for Parkinson's disease. We use expression and protein quantitative trait loci to mimic exposure to medications, and we examine the causal effect on Parkinson's disease risk (in two large cohorts), age at onset and progression. We propose 23 drug-targeting mechanisms for Parkinson's disease, including four possible drug repurposing opportunities and two drugs which may increase Parkinson's disease risk. Of these, we put forward six drug targets with the strongest Mendelian randomization evidence. There is remarkably little overlap between our drug targets to reduce Parkinson's disease risk versus progression, suggesting different molecular mechanisms. Drugs with genetic support are considerably more likely to succeed in clinical trials, and we provide compelling genetic evidence and an analysis pipeline to prioritise Parkinson's disease drug development.",

    "abstract": "The proximity ligation assay (PLA) is a specific and sensitive technique for the detection of \u03b1Syn oligomers (\u03b1Syn-PLA), early and toxic species implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. We aimed to evaluate by skin biopsy the diagnostic and prognostic capacity of \u03b1Syn-PLA and small nerve fiber reduction in PD in a longitudinal study. \u03b1Syn-PLA was performed in the ankle and cervical skin biopsies of PD (n\u2009=\u200930), atypical parkinsonisms (AP, n\u2009=\u200923) including multiple system atrophy (MSA, n\u2009=\u200912) and tauopathies (AP-Tau, n\u2009=\u200911), and healthy controls (HC, n\u2009=\u200922). Skin biopsy was also analyzed for phosphorylated \u03b1Syn (P-\u03b1Syn) and 5G4 (\u03b1Syn-5G4), a conformation-specific antibody to aggregated \u03b1Syn. Intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) was assessed as a measure of small fiber neuropathy. \u03b1Syn-PLA signal was more expressed in PD and MSA compared to controls and AP-Tau. \u03b1Syn-PLA showed the highest diagnostic accuracy (PD vs. HC sensitivity 80%, specificity 77%; PD vs. AP-Tau sensitivity 80%, specificity 82%), however, P-\u03b1Syn and 5G4, possible markers of later phases, performed better when considering the ankle site alone. A small fiber neuropathy was detected in PD and MSA. A progression of denervation not of pathological \u03b1Syn was detected at follow-up and a lower IENFD at baseline was associated with a greater cognitive and motor decline in PD. A skin biopsy-derived compound marker, resulting from a linear discrimination analysis model of \u03b1Syn-PLA, P-\u03b1Syn, \u03b1Syn-5G4, and IENFD, stratified patients with accuracy (77.8%), including the discrimination between PD and MSA (84.6%). In conclusion, the choice of pathological \u03b1Syn marker and anatomical site influences the diagnostic performance of skin biopsy and can help in understanding the temporal dynamics of \u03b1Syn spreading in the peripheral nervous system during the disease. Skin denervation, not pathological \u03b1Syn is a potential progression marker for PD.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and predict poorer outcomes. Reward processing dysfunction is a candidate mechanism for the development of psychiatric symptoms including depression and impulse control disorders (ICDs). We aimed to determine whether reward processing is impaired in PD and its relationship with neuropsychiatric syndromes and dopamine replacement therapy.\nThe Ovid MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase and PsycInfo databases were searched for articles published up to 5 November 2020. Studies reporting reward processing task performance by patients with PD and healthy controls were included. Summary statistics comparing reward processing between groups were converted to standardised mean difference (SMD) scores and meta-analysed using a random effects model.\nWe identified 55 studies containing 2578 participants (1638 PD and 940 healthy controls). Studies assessing three subcomponent categories of reward processing tasks were included: option valuation (n=12), reinforcement learning (n=37) and reward response vigour (n=6). Across all studies, patients with PD on medication exhibited a small-to-medium impairment versus healthy controls (SMD=0.34; 95%\u2009CI 0.14 to 0.53), with greater impairments observed off dopaminergic medication in within-subjects designs (SMD=0.43, 95%\u2009CI 0.29 to 0.57). Within-subjects subcomponent analysis revealed impaired processing off medication on option valuation (SMD=0.57, 95%\u2009CI 0.39 to 0.75) and reward response vigour (SMD=0.36, 95%\u2009CI 0.13 to 0.59) tasks. However, the opposite applied for reinforcement learning, which relative to healthy controls was impaired on-medication (SMD=0.45, 95%\u2009CI 0.25 to 0.65) but not off-medication (SMD=0.28, 95%\u2009CI -0.03 to 0.59). ICD was the only neuropsychiatric syndrome with sufficient studies (n=13) for meta-analysis, but no significant impairment was identified compared tonon-ICD patients (SMD=-0.02, 95%\u2009CI -0.43 to 0.39).\nReward processing disruption in PD differs according to subcomponent and dopamine medication state, and warrants further study as a potential treatment target and mechanism underlying associated neuropsychiatric syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease can be associated with speech deterioration and low communication confidence which in turn compromises social interaction. Therapeutic singing is an engaging method for combatting speech decline; however, face-to-face delivery can limit access to group singing. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of an online mode of delivery for a Parkinson's singing intervention (ParkinSong) as well as remote data collection procedures.\nThis ParkinSong Online feasibility trial is a single-arm, pre-post study of online singing delivery and remote data collection for 30 people living with Parkinson's. The primary outcome measure is feasibility: recruitment, retention, attendance, safety, intervention fidelity, acceptability and associated costs.

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a sensitive problem, which is caused by motor control deficits and requires greater attention during postural transitions such as turning in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the turning characteristics have not yet been extensively investigated to distinguish between people with PD with and without FOG (freezers and non-freezers) based on full-body kinematic analysis during the turning task. The objectives of this study were to identify the machine learning model that best classifies people with PD and freezers and reveal the associations between clinical characteristics and turning features based on feature selection through stepwise regression.\nThe study recruited 77 people with PD (31 freezers and 46 non-freezers) and 34 age-matched older adults. The 360\u00b0 turning task was performed at the preferred speed for the inner step of the more affected limb. All experiments on the people with PD were performed in the \"Off\" state of medication. The full-body kinematic features during the turning task were extracted using the three-dimensional motion capture system. These features were selected via stepwise regression.\nIn feature selection through stepwise regression, five and six features were identified to distinguish between people with PD and controls and between freezers and non-freezers (PD and FOG classification problem), respectively. The machine learning model accuracies revealed that the random forest (RF) model had 98.1% accuracy when using all turning features and 98.0% accuracy when using the five features selected for PD classification. In addition, RF and logistic regression showed accuracies of 79.4% when using all turning features and 72.9% when using the six selected features for FOG classification.\nWe suggest that our study leads to understanding of the turning characteristics of people with PD and freezers during the 360\u00b0 turning task for the inner step of the more affected limb and may help improve the objective classification and clinical assessment by disease progression using turning features.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), accompanied by accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein, chronic neuroinflammation and autophagy dysfunction. Previous studies suggested\u00a0that misfolded \u03b1-synuclein\u00a0induces\u00a0the inflammatory response\u00a0and\u00a0autophagy dysfunction in microglial cells.\u00a0The NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the neuroinflammatory process in the central nervous system.\u00a0However, the relationship between autophagy deficiency and NLRP3 activation induced by \u03b1-synuclein\u00a0accumulation is not well understood.\nThrough immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, ELISA and behavioral tests, we investigated the role of p38-TFEB-NLRP3 signaling pathways on neuroinflammation in the \u03b1-synuclein A53T PD models.\nOur results showed\u00a0that increased protein levels of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 in the \u03b1-synuclein A53T PD models. P38 is activated by overexpression of \u03b1-synuclein\u00a0A53T mutant, which inhibited the master transcriptional activator of autophagy TFEB. And we found that NLRP3 was degraded by\u00a0chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in microglial cells. Furthermore,\u00a0p38-TFEB pathways inhibited CMA-mediated NLRP3 degradation in Parkinson's disease. Inhibition of p38 had a protective effect on Parkinson's disease model via suppressing\u00a0the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Moreover, both p38 inhibitor SB203580 and NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 not only prevented neurodegeneration in vivo, but also alleviated movement impairment in \u03b1-synuclein\u00a0A53T-tg\u00a0mice model of Parkinson's disease.\nOur research reveals p38-TFEB pathways promote microglia activation through inhibiting CMA-mediated NLRP3 degradation in Parkinson's disease, which could be a potential therapeutic strategy for PD. p38-TFEB pathways promote microglia activation through inhibiting CMA-mediated NLRP3 degradation in Parkinson's disease. In this model, p38 activates NLRP3 inflammasome via inhibiting TFEB in microglia. TFEB signaling negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome through increasing LAMP2A expression, which binds to NLRP3 and promotes its degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). NLRP3-mediated microglial activation promotes the death of dopaminergic neurons.",

P38 is activated by overexpression of \u03b1-synuclein\u00a0A53T mutant, which inhibited the master transcriptional activator of autophagy TFEB. And we found that NLRP3 was degraded by\u00a0chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in microglial cells. Furthermore,\u00a0p38-TFEB pathways inhibited CMA-mediated NLRP3 degradation in Parkinson's disease. Inhibition of p38 had a protective effect on Parkinson's disease model via suppressing\u00a0the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Moreover, both p38 inhibitor SB203580 and NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 not only prevented neurodegeneration in vivo, but also alleviated movement impairment in \u03b1-synuclein\u00a0A53T-tg\u00a0mice model of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Biodex Balance System (BBS) is a low-cost platform used to assess balance in different populations. However, no study has used this tool to evaluate the risk of falls related to balance changes in non-faller individuals with Parkinson Disease (PD).\nThe aim of this study was to determine the changes in the balance in non-faller individuals with mild to moderate PD compared to healthy elders.\nForty-six PD patients at stages 2 and 3 were assessed in the 'on' state (fully medicated) as well as 31 age-matched healthy controls. They were submitted to the fall risk protocol of BBS and performed three 20-s trials and a 60-s rest interval between the trials.\nNon-faller PD patients had an increased instability when compared to the healthy controls in the anteroposterior (controls: 1.54\u2009\u00b1\u20091.00 vs. PD patients: 2.91\u2009\u00b1\u20090.93) and mediolateral directions (controls: 1.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.57 vs. PD patients: 1.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.46), resulting in a great overall instability in the PD patients (controls: 1.28\u2009\u00b1\u20090.61 vs. PD patients: 4.09\u2009\u00b1\u20091.22). A significant correlation between overall instability and UPDRS-III (motor symptoms) in individuals with PD was observed.\nBBS was able to identify the risk of falls in non-fallers, showing that PD patients have a greater risk of falls in unstable conditions than age-matched healthy elders, mainly due to the large sway in the anteroposterior direction. Furthermore, the severity of motor symptoms was related to overall instability which can increase the risk of falls in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Research on attitudes regarding the use and timing of deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been mostly qualitative to this date. In this study, we aim to examine attitudes and perceptions about the use and timing of DBS in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who have not had DBS. We designed an online survey comprising Likert-type, multiple choice, and rank-order questions and distributed it to PD patients. We recruited participants via flyers, the Michael J. Fox Foundation Trial Finder, and the Parkinson Alliance website. We analyzed considerations for choosing or rejecting DBS and when participants would consider such a decision to be premature. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, including a multinomial logistic regression model. Among the 285 participants who reported not having undergone DBS, the most frequent concerns were related to the efficacy of DBS and not having exhausted medication alternatives. DBS was viewed as less convenient, effective, and safe when PD symptoms were still manageable by medication. Our regression model suggests that having fewer concerns over technical problems was a positive predictor of preferring early DBS, while concerns over DBS interfering with friendships and relationships was a negative predictor. Our results suggest that patients with PD who have not undergone DBS have a wide variety of attitudes regarding DBS and its timing. Given the increasing number of therapeutic options for PD, future work should compare perceptions and preferences regarding different PD treatment modalities to provide the best counseling for patients regarding their therapeutic options.",

    "abstract": "Neuropeptides are bioactive molecules, made up of small chains of amino acids, with many neuromodulatory properties. Several lines of evidence suggest that neuropeptides, mainly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), play an important role in the onset of Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathology. The wide spread disruption of neuropeptides has been excessively demonstrated to be related to the pathophysiological symptoms in PD where impairment in motor function per example was correlated with neuropeptides dysregulation in the substantia niagra (SN). Moreover, the levels of different neuropeptides have been found modified in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood of PD patients, indicating their potential role in the manifestation of PD symptoms and dysfunctions. In this review, we outlined the neuroprotective effects of neuropeptides on dopaminergic neuronal loss, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in several models and tissues of PD. Our main focus was to elaborate the role of orexin, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), opioids, angiotensin, carnosine and many others in the protection and/or involvement in the neurodegeneration of striatal dopaminergic cells. Further studies are required to better assess the mode of action and cellular mechanisms of neuropeptides in order to shift the focus from the in vitro and in vivo testing to applicable clinical testing. This review, allows a support for future use of neuropeptides as therapeutic solution for PA pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "We recently showed that the prevalence of Parkinson's Disease (PD) in U.S. states is positively associated with the quantity of acid rain. Acid rain could play an etiologic role in PD by mobilizing metals, e.g., lead, from watersheds and pipes into drinking water. We assessed the correlation of PD with lead service lines, the underground pipes that connect homes to municipal water sources, which are a major aqueous source of lead.\nWe used multiple regression techniques to examine PD prevalence rates by state relative to the number of lead service lines. We included known or suspected aqueous risk factors, e.g., the Acid Precipitation Index (a measure of acid rain) and well water use.\nAge-, race-, and sex-adjusted prevalence rates for PD were significantly and positively correlated with the log number of lead service lines (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0004). The effect of lead service lines remained significant after adjusting for the effects of acid rain and well water use (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0019).\nThese findings are consistent with a role for lead in the etiology of PD. Studies of lead service line exposure in relation to PD at the individual level are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Young onset Parkinson's disease (YOPD) is a distinct entity from typical late onset Parkinson's disease (LOPD). The influene of non-motor features on the health - related quality of life (HRQoL) in LOPD has been previously reported, but little is known about the impact of non-motor features in YOPD.\nThe aim of this study was to explore the relationship between non-motor burden and HRQoL in patients with YOPD.\nThis was an observational, cross-sectional study in patients with a PD, whose age at disease onset ranged from 21 to 40\u00a0years (YOPD). Participants were assessed with the MDS Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) and the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39; range 0-100). Spearman's rank test was used to identify correlations between NMSS domains and several dimension of HRQoL. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify the independent predictors of HRQoL as measured by PDQ-39 summary index.\n89 patients with YOPD mean (SD) age\u00a0=\u00a042.15 (5.84) participated. Patients reported 10.17 (4.74) non-motor symptoms, the most common (75%) and severe (median\u00a0=\u00a03) of which was was fatigue (IQR\u00a0=\u00a07). The most frequently reported and severely affected NMSS domain was sleep/fatigue (89.9%, median\u00a0=\u00a08; IQR\u00a0=\u00a013) followed by mood/cognition (83.1%, median\u00a0=\u00a06; IQR\u00a0=\u00a018) and attention/memory (82%, median\u00a0=\u00a05; IQR\u00a0=\u00a08). The mean (SD) summary index of PDQ-39 was 32.89 (16.8). The means (SD) of each PDQ-39 dimensions were: mobility 37.33 (21.96), ADL 42.93 (25.33), emotional well-being 39.77 (25.47), stigma 38.19 (28.44), social support 19.03 (22.89), cognition 29.59 (20.63), communication 26.96 (23.57), and bodily discomfort 29.96 (23.19). With the exception of gastrointestinal tract and sexual function, all other NMSS domain scores were correlated with the PDQ-39 summary index. The multivariate model revealed that three NMSS domains including sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition and attention/memory accompanied with UPDRS part III were independent predictors of HRQoL as measured by PDQ-39SI.\nNon-motor symptoms pertaining to sleep disturbances/fatigue, mood/cognition and attention/memory negatively impact HRQoL in patients with YOPD.",

    "abstract": "Neurological diseases, such as MS, AD, PD and HD, are a major health concern of the elderly population, but still therapeutic options are limited. Recent advances in genomic sequencing and bioinformatics, present an opportunity to understand mechanisms of these diseases for identification of therapeutic targets. Several studies have shown association of immune dysfunction with immune system mediated neurological disease, MS, as well as neurodegenerative diseases (AD, PD and HD). However, similarities and differences in role of the immune system, immune pathways and immune cell types in these diseases remains unknown. In this study, immune cell type signature genes in gene networks associated with neurological diseases, MS, AD, PD and HD was investigated using meta-analysis and bioinformatics methods. Application of Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) on publicly available gene expression datasets (microarray and RNA-seq) revealed a ModArray_04 module (microarray) or ModRNAseq_06 module (RNA-seq), significantly associated with MS, AD, PD and HD. Hypergeometric enrichment test revealed significant enrichment of immune cell type genes in these neurological disease modules. This study demonstrates that immune system mediated neurological disease, MS and neurodegenerative diseases (AD, PD and HD), share a common gene network characterized by immune cell type signature genes (microglia, monocytes and macrophages) and are probable targets for therapeutic intervention. In summary, this work shows a connection between MS, a disease where the role of the immune system and inflammation is established, and neurodegenerative diseases (AD, PD and HD) where the role of inflammation is still a hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation and mitochondrial impairment play important roles in the neuropathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) are strictly correlated to neuroinflammation. Therefore, the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and \u03b1-Syn aggregation might have therapeutic potential. It has been indicated that Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) produces neuroprotection against some neurological diseases such as ischemic stroke. We here intended to explore whether NBP suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reduced \u03b1-Syn aggregation, thus protecting dopaminergic neurons against neuroinflammation.\nIn our study, we established a MPTP-induced mouse model and 6-OHDA-induced SH-SY5Y cell model to examine the neuroprotective actions of NBP. We then performed behavioral tests to examine motor dysfunction in MPTP-exposed mice after NBP treatment. Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry and RT-qPCR were conducted to investigate the expression of NLRP3 inflammasomes, neuroinflammatory cytokines, PARP1, p-\u03b1-Syn, and markers of microgliosis and\u00a0astrogliosis.\nThe results showed that NBP exerts a neuroprotective effect on experimental PD models. \nIn summary, NBP rescued dopaminergic neurons by reducing NLRP3 inflammasome activation and ameliorating mitochondrial impairments and increases in p-\u03b1-Syn levels. This current study may provide novel neuroprotective mechanisms of NBP as a potential therapeutic agent.",

    "abstract": "Pain is one of the most frequent non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) and it has a great impact on patient's quality of life. Thus, its quantitative evaluation is critical in establishing therapeutic evidence. The King's Parkinson's Disease Pain Scale (KPPS) was introduced as a scale of pain specific to PD in 2015. As a follow-up to the evaluator-based KPPS, the patient-based questionnaire, the King's Parkinson's Disease Pain Questionnaire (KPPQ), was introduced in 2018. We developed a linguistically validated Japanese version of the KPPS and KPPQ, and the process of its construction is reported in this study.",

    "abstract": "We conducted the multicenter questionnaire survey targeting patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in order to investigate the impacts on their daily lives and their requests to hospitals in the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Mainly using open-ended questionnaire, we asked their anxiety, troubles they are facing, and requests toward hospitals in the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2. Two hundred fifth-eight PD patients answered the questionnaire. There were various opinions about anxiety such as \"PD patients are susceptible and vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2\" (36.8%). Concerning the troubles in the pandemic, the most frequent answer was that they couldn't participate in the rehabilitation and elderly day care (38.4%). Relatively many PD patients requested telemedicine (29.5%), whereas some people hoped face-to-face medical care (8.1%). There were demands about the delivery of medications (50.0%), the establishment of telephone consultations (43.8%), resources for rehabilitation at home (43.8%). The medical care adapted to the anxiety, trouble and requests of PD patients will be required in the era when we have to live with SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The number of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients has been increasing year by year in Japan. However, there are few reports that comprehensively evaluate the symptoms and treatment details of PD patients. We collected and analyzed information on PD patients regularly visiting the Department of Neurology at Saiseikai Matsuyama Hospital as of the end of October 2020. We included 187 patients (83 males and 104 females) with a mean age of 73.6 years and a mean disease duration of 8.9 years. The disease duration was positively correlated with Hoehn & Yahr (HY) stage and the number of antiparkinsonian drugs. The L-dopa equivalent dose decreased after 20 years of disease duration or HY 5. Wearing-off phenomenon and L-dopa-induced dyskinesia were more common in patients with longer duration of disease and higher daily dose of L-dopa. This study provides an overview of the clinical picture of PD patients in a regional core hospital.",

He subsequently developed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and brain magnetic resonance imaging indicated vasogenic edema in the white matter of the left frontal subcortex. He was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome (NS) and atypical posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). LCIG cessation and corticosteroid treatment improved the NS. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of NS and atypical PRES in patients with Parkinson's disease. Patients being treated with LCIG should be closely monitored for NS.",

    "abstract": "PPAR gamma co-activator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) is known as the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. It is also a co-activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR\u03b3) and plays a role in preventing mitochondrial dysfunction in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Depletion in the levels of these proteins has been linked to oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA damage, all of which are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.\nIn the present study, combination therapy of PPAR\u03b3 agonist (GW1929) and PGC-1\u03b1 activator (alpha-lipoic acid) was employed to ameliorate cognitive deficits, oxidative stress, and inflammation associated with the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of PD.\nPD was induced using a bilateral intranigral administration of MPTP in Sprague Dawley rats, and different parameters were evaluated.\nOur study showed that MPTP-induced PD rats exhibited an increase in oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to cognitive deficits. Furthermore, MPTP-induced PD rats also exhibited reduced mitochondrial biogenesis in comparison to control and sham animals. Intraperitoneal administration of GW 1929 and alpha-lipoic acid in doses lower than those earlier reported individually in literature led to an improvement in the cognitive deficits in comparison to MPTP-induced PD rats. These improvements were accompanied by a reduction in the levels of oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis was also observed after the combination of these pharmacological agents.\nOur results provide a rationale for the development of agents targeting PPAR\u03b3 and PGC-1\u03b1 as potent therapeutics for the treatment of neurological diseases like PD.",

Furthermore, MPTP-induced PD rats also exhibited reduced mitochondrial biogenesis in comparison to control and sham animals. Intraperitoneal administration of GW 1929 and alpha-lipoic acid in doses lower than those earlier reported individually in literature led to an improvement in the cognitive deficits in comparison to MPTP-induced PD rats. These improvements were accompanied by a reduction in the levels of oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis was also observed after the combination of these pharmacological agents.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease are believed to be most prevalent and common in older people. Several data-mining approaches are employed on the neuro-degenerative data in predicting the disease. A novel method has been built and developed to diagnose Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) in early stages, which includes image acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction and selection, followed by classification. The challenge lies in selecting the optimal feature subset for classification. In this work, the Sunflower Optimisation Algorithm (SFO) is employed to select the optimal feature set, which is then fed to the Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) for classification. The method is tested on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and local dataset for AD, the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository and the Istanbul dataset for PD. Experimental outcomes have demonstrated a high accuracy level in both AD and PD diagnosis. For AD diagnosis, the highest classification rate is obtained for the AD versus NC classification using the ADNI dataset (99.32%) and local dataset (98.65%). For PD diagnosis, the highest accuracy of 99.52% and 99.45% is achieved on the UCI and Istanbul datasets, respectively. To show the robustness of the method, the method is compared with other similar methods of feature selection and classification with 10-fold cross-validation (CV) and with unseen data. The method proposed has an excellent prospect, bringing greater convenience to clinicians in making a better solid decision in clinical diagnosis of neuro-degenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurological disorder marked by characteristic poverty and dysfunction in movement. There are many mechanisms and factors which have been postulated to be associated with the neurodegenerative pathway(s) resulting in distinctive loss of neurons in the substantia nigra. Subsequently, the neuropathology is more widespread and exhibited in other areas of the brain, and enteric nervous system. Aggregates of misfolded \u03b1-synuclein or Lewy bodies are the hallmark of the illness and appear to be central in the whole cascade of cell destruction. There are many processes implicated in neuronal destruction including: oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, an imbalance in protein homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Interesting, inflammation induced by pathogens (including, bacteria and viruses) has been associated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori and Helicobacter suis appear to colonise the gut, and elicit systemic immune responses, which is them transmitted via the gut-axis to the brain, where cytotoxic cytokines induce neuroinflammation and cell death. This conforms to the bottom-top hypothesis proposed by Braak. The gut is also implicated in two other theories postulated in the development and progression of the disorder, namely, the top-down and the threshold. There is a possibility that these theories may be inter-linked and operate together to certain degree. Ultimately specific trigger factors or conditions may govern the occurrences of these processes in genetically predisposed individuals. Nevertheless, the importance of pathogen-related gut infections cannot be overlooked, since it can result in dysbiosis of gut microbes, which may orchestrate \u03b1-synuclein pathology and eventually cell destruction.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic deposition of aberrantly misfolded \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) is a common feature of synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the precise pathogenic mechanism of \u03b1-Syn in synucleinopathies remains elusive. Emerging evidence has suggested that \u03b1-Syn may contribute to PD pathogenesis in several ways; wherein the contribution of fibrillar species, for exerting toxicity and disease transmission, cannot be neglected. Further, the oligomeric species could be the most plausible neurotoxic species causing neuronal cell death. However, understanding the structural and molecular insights of these oligomers are very challenging due to the heterogeneity and transient nature of the species. In this review, we discuss the recent advancements in understanding the formation and role of \u03b1-Syn oligomers in PD pathogenesis. We also summarize the different types of \u03b1-Syn oligomeric species and potential mechanisms to exert neurotoxicity. Finally, we address the possible ways to target \u03b1-Syn as a promising approach against PD and the possible future directions.",

    "abstract": "Postural abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD) can devastatingly impair the quality of life, especially in patients with advanced disease, and are generally refractory to dopaminergic agents. The objective of this exploratory study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of istradefylline for the treatment of postural abnormalities in PD. In this open-label, 24-week, single-arm prospective trial, PD patients with postural abnormalities experiencing the wearing-off phenomenon on levodopa-containing therapies were enrolled and received a starting dose of 20\u00a0mg/day istradefylline orally for 4\u00a0weeks, which was then increased to 40\u00a0mg/day. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 24 in the 14-item Unified Dystonia Rating Scale (UDRS) total score. Pivotal secondary endpoints were changes in the sub-items of UDRS, Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Overall, 24/31 enrolled patients completed the study; mean (standard deviation) age and duration of motor complications were 73.3 (7.7) years and 3.2 (4.4) years, respectively. Mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) change in the UDRS total score was 4.84 (1.97, 7.71; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002), with significant improvements in the neck, right distal arm and hand, and trunk severity scores. Mean (95% CI) change in the MDS-UPDRS part III score was 7.84 (4.34, 11.34; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The most common ADRs were malaise, dyskinesia exacerbation, and visual hallucinations in 2 (6.5%) patients each. This exploratory study demonstrated that istradefylline could be efficacious for postural abnormalities and was generally well tolerated in patients with PD experiencing the wearing-off phenomenon with levodopa-containing therapies.",

This study aimed to verify whether adding WATSU to land-based therapy leads to additional beneficial therapeutic effects regarding quality of sleep and quality of life (QOL) in individuals with PD.\nA randomized control trial design was used. Participants completed nine-week interventions. The control group (CG) received land-based therapy, while the intervention group (IG) received the same land-based therapy and additionally WATSU. Sleep quality and QOL were measured at baseline and post-interventions by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Nottingham Health Profile, respectively.\nTwenty-eight participants completed the study. In contrast to CG, the IG presented with significant improvements in both, quality of sleep and QOL (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nWATSU has the potential to be an attractive adjunct therapy for producing positive health impacts regarding sleep quality, which may translate to an overall improvement in QOL of individuals with PD.",

    "abstract": "Greater depressive symptoms are associated with worse cognitive functions in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, it is unclear what underlying factors drive this association. Apathy commonly develops in PD and may be a pathway through which depressive symptoms negatively influence cognition. Prior research examining depressive symptoms, apathy, and cognition in PD is limited by being predominantly cross-sectional. This study examined the role of apathy as a within- and between-person mediator for the longitudinal relationships between depression severity and cognitive functioning in patients with early PD.\nParticipants included 487 individuals newly diagnosed with PD followed annually for up to 5 years by the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative. At each visit, participants completed depressive symptom measures, apathy ratings, and cognitive tests. Multi-level structural equation models examined both the within- and between-person effects of depressive symptoms on cognition through apathy, controlling for demographics and motor severity.\nAt the within-person level, apathy mediated the association between depressive symptoms and select cognitive functions (global cognition, attention/working memory, visuospatial functions, and immediate verbal memory; indirect effects, bootstrap p's <0.05). Significant between-person direct effects were found for depressive symptoms predicting apathy (boostrap p <0.001) and lower scores on most cognitive tests (bootstrap p's <0.05). However, the indirect effects did not reach significance, suggesting between-person mediation did not occur.\nFindings suggest worsening of depressive symptoms over time in patients with PD may be a risk factor for increased apathy and subsequent decline in specific cognitive functions.",

Their peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples were collected and proposed for the reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction to complete lncRNA ANRIL, miR-34a, and miR-125a measurements.\nLncRNA ANRIL was upregulated, while miR-34a and miR-125a were downregulated in PD patients compared to controls (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Further, they all showed certain values for PD risk identification by ROC curve analyses, among which lncRNA ANRIL showed the highest AUC (AUC: 0.879, 95% CI: 0.824-0.934). Furthermore, lncRNA ANRIL negatively correlated with miR-34a (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) and miR-125a (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) in PD patients, but not in controls.

    "abstract": "Sleep disorders are the main non-motor characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD). The quality of life is significantly impacted by rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). It is not clearly evidenced in the literature that some medications can reduce the dream activities of patients with PD and RBD and improve sleep quality. And, they have side effects that may increase the severity of this disease. To further understand which medication has better efficacy and fewer adverse effects for patients with PD and RBD, it is necessary to perform a network meta-analysis.\nThis protocol is performed accordingly to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols and the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook.A thorough literature selection will be conducted up to September 2021 using PubMed, Cochrane Library (The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) and Embase. We will not only include randomised controlled trials, but prospective, retrospective cohort, case-control, nested case-control, case-cohort, cross-sectional and case series. We will use the Cochrane Collaboration tool to assess the risk of bias. Pairwise and network meta-analyses will be conducted using the R netmeta package and Stata V.14.0.

    "abstract": "Gait termination (GT) is a challenging transitory task involving converting from a dynamic state of motion to a static state. These transitional locomotor tasks are particularly troublesome for populations with postural deficits, i.e., Parkinson's disease (PD) and Essential Tremor (ET). They demand greater postural control and intricate integration of the neuromuscular system. The mechanisms involved in GT in these populations have not been well studied despite the safety concerns and potential risk for falls. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the different control strategies utilized during GT between individuals with ET and PD.\nTwenty-four individuals with ET (66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0yrs), twenty-four individuals with PD (64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0yrs), and twenty healthy older adults (HOA: 63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09\u00a0yrs) participated in this study. Average self-selected gait velocity for each group was collected during the GT trial walking portion. Ground reaction force (GRF) data were used to calculate braking and propulsive forces from the last two steps during GT. GRF data measured the dynamic postural stability index (DPSI), defined as an individual's ability to maintain balance while transitioning from a dynamic to a stable state.\nPersons with ET had a significantly slower approach velocity (0.63\u00a0m/s) when compared to HOA (0.92\u00a0m/s) and PD (0.77\u00a0m/s). Persons with PD had significantly slower approach velocity when compared to HOA. Examination of GRF data found that those with ET generated significantly smaller propulsive and braking forces (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Forces increased in those with PD and then even more in the HOA group. Postural stability analysis revealed that ET had significantly worse stability scores than PD and HOA (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05).\nIndividuals with PD and ET utilize different control strategies for planned GT, which suggests both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia play central yet potentially different roles in anticipatory control during self-directed activities.",

    "abstract": "The \"dual syndrome hypothesis\" distinguished two subtypes in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Parkinson's disease: frontostriatal, characterized by attentional and executive deficits; and posterior cortical, characterized by visuospatial, memory, and language deficits.\nThe aim was to identify resting-state functional modifications associated with these subtypes.\nNinety-five nondemented patients categorized as having normal cognition (n\u00a0=\u00a031), frontostriatal (n\u00a0=\u00a014), posterior cortical (n\u00a0=\u00a020), or mixed (n\u00a0=\u00a030) cognitive subtype had a 3\u2009T resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Twenty-four age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were also included. A group-level independent component analysis was performed to identify resting-state networks, and the selected components were subdivided into 564 cortical regions in addition to 26 basal ganglia regions. Global intra- and inter-network connectivity along with global and local efficiencies was compared between groups. The network-based statistics approach was used to identify connections significantly different between groups.\nPatients with posterior cortical deficits had increased intra-network functional connectivity (FC) within the basal ganglia network compared with patients with frontostriatal deficits. Patients with frontostriatal deficits had reduced inter-network FC between several networks, including the visual, default-mode, sensorimotor, salience, dorsal attentional, basal ganglia, and frontoparietal networks, compared with HCs, patients with normal cognition, and patients with a posterior cortical subtype. Similar results were also found between patients with a mixed subtype and HCs.\nMCI subtypes are associated with specific changes in resting-state FC. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine the predictive potential of these markers regarding the risk of developing dementia. \u00a9 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Amantadine is an old, antiviral compound, which moderately improves motor behavior in Parkinson's disease. Its current resurgence results from an innovative, delayed uptake and extended release amantadine hydrochloride capsule, given at bedtime once daily. It is the only approved compound for reduction of involuntary movements, so called dyskinesia, in fluctuating orally levodopa treated patients. It additionally ameliorates 'OFF' intervals characterized by impaired motor behavior. These beneficial effects result from higher and more continuous brain delivery of amantadine. Future clinical research is warranted on preventive effects of this amantadine capsule combined with enzyme blockers of central monoamine oxidase B and peripheral catechol-O-methyltransferase on motor complications in orally levodopa treated patients, as all these pharmacological principles support the concept of continuous dopamine substitution.\nLay abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. It causes motor and non-motor symptoms and provides considerable burden on the healthcare system. Levodopa is looked upon as gold standard therapy for PD. However prolonged administration and high dosing leads to the emergence of motor complications, which are\u00a0involuntary movements, so called dyskinesia, and \u2018OFF\u2019 episodes. These are intervals with temporary onset of motor symptoms. The old, antiviral compound amantadine also moderately improves motor behavior in PD. Its current resurgence results from an innovative, delayed uptake and extended release amantadine hydrochloride capsule. It is given at bedtime once daily. This formulation provides a higher and more continuous brain delivery of amantadine. This new formulation improved motor complications in two Phase III studies. These benefits remained over long-term application. This formulation was well tolerated. No new safety concerns were observed (Table 1). This review suggests a future clinical study on preventive effects of this amantadine capsule combined with enzyme blockers of central monoamine oxidase B and peripheral catechol-O-methyltransferase in Parkinson's disease patients with a need for oral levodopa treatment. All these pharmacological principles support the concept of continuous dopamine substitution.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with non-motor complications such as sleep disturbance and depression. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) showed therapeutic effects on the motor dysfunctions. However, the potential effects of tDCS therapy on melatonin hormone, sleep dysfunctions, and depression in patients with PD still unclear. This feasibility study aimed to identify any potential changes in melatonin serum level, sleep functions and depression after the bilateral anodal tDCS in patients with PD.\nTensessions of bilateral anodal tDCS stimulation applied over left and right prefrontal and motor areas were given to twenty-five patients with PD. Melatonin serum level, Pittsburgh sleep quality index, and geriatric depression scale examined before and after tDCS stimulation.\nAfter bilateral anodal tDCS, there was a significant reduction in melatonin serum level, improvement in depression, improvements in overall sleep quality, and sleep latency. Correlations test showed significant associations between melatonin serum level reduction and changes in subjective sleep quality, and sleep duration, as well as between improvements in depression and overall sleep quality, sleep latency, and sleep disturbance.\nBilateral anodal tDCS therapy was a feasible and safe tool that showed potential therapeutic effects on melatonin serum level, sleep quality, and depression level in patients with PD. Although the further large scale and randomized-control trial studies are crucially needed, there is still a need for such a feasibility study to be established before such trials can be implemented as is recommended in the new medical research council guidelines.",

    "abstract": "In a previously healthy asymptomatic 18-year old male, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) with left ventricular hypertrabeculation/noncompaction (LVHT) and systolic dysfunction was detected. Holter monitoring disclosed multiple long episodes of supraventricular tachycardia with a heart rate of about 110/min. After radiofrequency ablation of an epicardial posteroseptal accessory pathway with ante- and retrograde conduction, systolic function gradually normalized without any pharmacotherapy. After 32 months of follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic with normal systolic function. WPW-induced tachycardiomyopathy may even occur in asymptomatic patients, who are so adapted to their arrhythmias that they do not recognize them. <",

    "abstract": "Autonomic dysfunction (AutD) is one of the non-motor symptoms (NMSs) in Parkinson's disease (PD). To investigate the prevalence and clinical features of AutD in Chinese patients with PD, a large multicenter cohort of 2,556 individuals with PD were consecutively involved in the Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Multicenter Database and Collaborative Network in China (PD-MDCNC) between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019. The assessment of AutD was performed using the Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease for Autonomic Symptoms (SCOPA-AUT). The evaluation of motor symptoms and other NMSs were performed using well-established scales recommended by the Movement Disorder Society. We found that out of 2,556 patients with PD, 2,333 patients with PD (91.28%) had AutD. Compared with the group of patients with PD without AutD, the group of patients with PD with AutD had older age, older age of onset, longer disease duration, more severe motor symptoms, motor complications, and more frequent NMSs. As for partial correlation analysis, the total SCOPA-AUT score was significantly and positively associated with motor severity scales [Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) total score] and some of the NMSs [Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder Questionnaire (RBD), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale], Fatigue Severity Scale, and Parkinson's disease questionnaire. PD Sleep Scale was significantly and negatively correlated with AutD. With logistic regression analysis for potentially related factors, age, UPDRS total score, RBD, hyposmia, depression, and fatigue may be associated with PD with AutD. In conclusion, our multicenter cohort study reported the high prevalence of AutD in Chinese PD and revealed the associated factors of PD with AutD.",

    "abstract": "In chronic disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), fear of falling (FOF) is associated with falls and reduced quality of life. With inertial measurement units (IMUs) and dedicated algorithms, different aspects of mobility can be obtained during supervised tests in the lab and also during daily activities. To our best knowledge, the effect of FOF on mobility has not been investigated in both of these settings simultaneously. Our goal was to evaluate the effect of FOF on the mobility of 26 patients with PD during clinical assessments and 14 days of daily activity monitoring. Parameters related to gait, sit-to-stand transitions, and turns were extracted from IMU signals on the lower back. Fear of falling was assessed using the Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) and the patients were grouped as with (PD-FOF+) and without FOF (PD-FOF-). Mobility parameters between groups were compared using logistic regression as well as the effect size values obtained using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The peak angular velocity of the turn-to-sit transition of the timed-up-and-go (TUG) test had the highest discriminative power between PD-FOF+ and PD-FOF- (",

    "abstract": "The finger tapping task (FTT) is commonly used in the evaluation of dyskinesia among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Past research has indicated that cortical activation during FTT is different between self-priming and cue-priming conditions. To evaluate how priming conditions affect the distribution of brain activation and the reorganization of brain function, and to investigate the differences in brain activation areas during FTT between PD patients and healthy control (HC) participants, we conducted an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on the existing literature. Analyses were based on data from 15 independent samples that included 181 participants with PD and 164 HC participants. We found that there was significantly more activation in the middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, post-central gyrus, superior parietal lobe, inferior parietal lobule, cerebellum, and basal ganglia during FTT in PD patients than in HCs. In self-priming conditions, PD patients had less activation in the parietal lobe and insular cortex but more activation in the cerebellum than the HCs. In cue-priming conditions, the PD patients showed less activation in the cerebellum and frontal-parietal areas and more activation in the superior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus than the HCs. Our study illustrates that cue-priming manipulations affect the distribution of activity in brain regions involved in motor control and motor performance in PD patients. In cue-priming conditions, brain activity in regions associated with perceptual processing and inhibitory control was enhanced, while sensory motor areas associated with attention and motor control were impaired.",

    "abstract": "Quality of life (QOL) plays an important role in independent living in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, being crucial to know what factors impact QoL throughout the course of the disease. Here we identified predictors of QoL impairment in PD patients from a Spanish cohort. PD patients recruited from 35 centers of Spain from the COPPADIS cohort from January 2016, to November 2017, were followed up during 2 years. Health-related QoL (HRQoL) and global QoL (GQoL) were assessed with the 39-item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) and the EUROHIS-QOL 8-item index (EUROHIS-QOL8), respectively, at baseline (V0) and at 24 months \u00b1 1 month (V2). Clinically significant QoL impairment was defined as presenting an increase (PDQ-39SI) or decrement (EUROHIS-QOL8) at V2 \u2265 10% of the score at baseline (V0). A comparison with a control group was conducted for GQoL. GQoL did not change significantly in PD patients (N\u2009=\u2009507; p\u2009=\u20090.686) or in the control group (N\u2009=\u2009119; p\u2009=\u20090.192). The mean PDQ-39SI was significantly increased in PD patients (62.7\u2009\u00b1\u20098.5 years old; 58.8% males; N\u2009=\u2009500) by 21.6% (from 16.7\u2009\u00b1\u200913 to 20.3\u2009\u00b1\u200916.4; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) at V2. Ninety-three patients (18.6%) presented a clinically significant HRQoL impairment at V2. To be younger (OR\u2009=\u20090.896; 95% CI 0.829-0.968; p\u2009=\u20090.006), to be a female (OR\u2009=\u20094.181; 95% CI 1.422-12.290; p\u2009=\u20090.009), and to have a greater increase in BDI-II (Beck Depression Inventory-II) (OR\u2009=\u20091.139; 95% CI 1.053-1.231; p\u2009=\u20090.001) and NMSS (Non-Motor Symptoms Scale) (OR\u2009=\u20091.052; 95% CI 1.027-1.113; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) total scores from V0 to V2 were associated with clinically significant HRQoL impairment at the 2-year follow-up (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, p\u2009=\u20090.665; R",

    "abstract": "Diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD) before the clinical onset proves difficult because the hallmark PD symptoms do not manifest until more than 60% of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta have been lost. Here we show that, by evoking a transient dopamine release and subsequently measuring the levels of dopamine metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma, a hypodopaminergic state can be revealed when less than 30% of dopamine neurons are lost in mouse PD models. These findings may lead to sensitive and practical screening and diagnostic tests for detecting early PD in the high-risk population.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in time-varying functional connectivity (FC) have been found in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. To date, very little is known about the influence of sex on brain FC in PD patients and how this could be related to disease severity. The first objective was to evaluate the influence of sex on dynamic FC characteristics in PD patients and healthy controls (HC), while the second aim was to investigate the temporal patterns of dynamic connectivity related to PD motor and non-motor symptoms. Ninety-nine PD patients and sixty-two HC underwent a neuropsychological and clinical assessment. Rs-fMRI and T1-weighted MRI were also acquired. Dynamic FC analyses were performed in the GIFT toolbox. Dynamic FC analyses identified two States: State I, characterized by within-network positive coupling; and State II that showed between-network connectivity, mostly involving somatomotor and visual networks. Sex differences were found in dynamic indexes in HC but these differences were not observed in PD. Hierarchical clustering analysis identified three phenotypically distinct PD subgroups: (1) Subgroup A was characterized by mild motor symptoms; (2) Subgroup B was characterized by depressive and motor symptoms; (3) Subgroup C was characterized by cognitive and motor symptoms. Results revealed that changes in the temporal properties of connectivity were related to the motor/non-motor outcomes of PD severity. Findings suggest that while in HC sex differences may play a certain role in dynamic connectivity patterns, in PD patients, these effects may be overcome by the neurodegenerative process. Changes in the temporal properties of connectivity in PD were mainly related to the clinical markers of PD severity.",

    "abstract": "Impaired motor function is one of the early symptoms shown in patients with Parkinson Disease (PD). For this reason, rehabilitative interventions have been used for many years to improve motor and non-motor symptoms. Among them, the use of music therapy has shown benefits in helping to overcome some of the most common motor dysfunction. Addressing the challenge of providing access to this type of therapy, this document presents the collaborative design process to develop a remote training support tool for PD based on music therapy.\nA qualitative study with creative co-design methods was used in which different groups of healthcare professionals, patients, and relatives participated in six iterative sessions. Workshops were designed and structured to incrementally discover requirements and needs and validate the proposed prototype ideas.\nThe study provided key aspects that were used for the development and validation of the proposed prototypes for the remote music-based training support tool for PD. Up to 20 factors that had a positive and/or negative influence on patient access to training were detected. These factors were classified into three common themes: daily activities and independence, participation in treatment and barriers to daily treatment, and self-management and personalization of information and telecommunication technologies (ICT).\nThis paper shows the results of a collaborative design process aimed at identifying the different factors, relevant to patients with PD, to improve their access to remote ICT-based training therapy and their expectations regarding alternative therapies, such as music. The participatory design methods and the iterative model used helped overcome many of the traditionally barriers that this type of technological support solutions usually have, facilitating the future participation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients often complain of pain, but this problem has been neglected and is poorly understood. High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), an alarmin/damage-associated molecular patterns protein, is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid in PD patients. However, little is known of the relationship between HMGB1 and pain associated with PD. Here, we investigated the role of central HMGB1 in the regulation of nociceptive hypersensitivity in a mouse model of PD. Male ddY mice were microinjected unilaterally with 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) into the striatum. These hemi-PD mice were treated with anti-HMGB1 neutralizing antibody (nAb; 10\u00a0\u00b5g in 10\u00a0\u00b5L) by intranasal (i.n.) administration. The mechanical hypersensitivity of the hind paws was evaluated with the von Frey test. Spinal microglial activity was analyzed by immunostaining for ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1. The 6OHDA-administered mice displayed unilateral loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and mechanical hypersensitivity in both hind paws. Moreover, spinal microglia were activated in these hemi-PD mice. Twenty-eight days after the 6OHDA injections, repeated i.n., but not systemic, treatment with anti-HMGB1 nAb inhibited the bilateral mechanical hypersensitivity and spinal microglial activation. However, the anti-HMGB1 nAb did not ameliorate the dopamine neuron loss. Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection with recombinant HMGB1 induced mechanical hypersensitivity. These findings indicate that HMGB1 is involved in the maintenance of nociceptive symptoms in hemi-PD mice via spinal microglial activation. Therefore, central HMGB1 may have potential as a therapeutic target for pain associated with PD.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has showed variable therapeutic effect on freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD). It is unclear which factors associated with the effect of DBS on FOG in patients with advanced PD. In this study, we investigated the correlation of pre and postoperative factors with the therapeutic effect of globus pallidus interna (GPi) DBS on FOG in PD patients.\nWe retrospectively analyzed PD patients with FOG (N\u00a0=\u00a020) who underwent GPi DBS surgery. Postoperatively, video-based analysis for FOG severity was performed at the first DBS programming and patients were categorized into two groups according to DBS effect on FOG (11 FOG responders and 9 FOG non-responders) at medication-off state. We analyzed preoperative clinical characteristics, cognitive function, striatal dopamine transporter availability, postoperative DBS programming parameters, lead locations, and volume of tissue activated in functional subregions of GPi. Bootstrap enhanced Elastic-Net logistic regression was used to select pre and postoperative factors associated with the effect of GPi DBS.\nTherapeutic effect of GPi DBS on FOG were correlated with the disease duration of PD before DBS surgery, preoperative improvement in FOG severity by levodopa medication, and the distance from active contact of DBS electrode to the prefrontal region of GPi anatomical site.\nOur study results suggest that the effect of GPi DBS on FOG is correlated with disease duration, levodopa responsiveness on FOG before DBS surgery and DBS electrode location, providing useful information to predict FOG outcome after GPi DBS in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Turning is a common trigger for freezing episodes in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Freezing during turning can lead to falls and fractures and decreased quality of life.\nDoes foot-strike contact variability also increase during turning, as previously reported in straight gait in PD patients with Freezing of Gait (FOG)?\nSubjects were instructed to walk on a gait mat, making \"normal pivot\" (180\u00b0) turns at each end. ProtoKinetics Movement Analysis Software (PKMAS) software was used for analysis. Video recordings and foot-pressure-prints were studied to identify and define turn segments. Spatiotemporal gait and turn measures were then determined only for the turn segments. A movement disorders neurologist determined clinical freezes.\n100 subjects (28 controls, 38 noFOG and 34 FOG) were included. Compared to non-freezers (noFOG), FOG subjects had a smaller foot-strike during turning (a measure of completeness of foot contact with the mat) and increased foot-strike variability. FOG subjects also had a shorter stride-length, slower stride-velocity, and greater swing phase time and percentage during turns. After adjusting for turn direction, inner/outer leg dynamics showed heavier inner leg footsteps in FOG subjects. 38% of FOG subjects experienced freezes during turning. 69% of freezes occurred during the middle third of the turn. Turn-freezers had more severe spatiotemporal gait deficits.\nDeveloping targeted therapies to retrain subjects to plant their whole foot on the ground with more consistency could help decrease episodes of freezing of gait.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause autosomal dominant Parkinson disease (PD), while polymorphic LRRK2 variants are associated with sporadic PD. PD-linked mutations increase LRRK2 kinase activity and induce neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. The small GTPase Rab8a is a LRRK2 kinase substrate and is involved in receptor-mediated recycling and endocytic trafficking of transferrin, but the effect of PD-linked LRRK2 mutations on the function of Rab8a is poorly understood. Here, we show that gain-of-function mutations in LRRK2 induce sequestration of endogenous Rab8a to lysosomes in overexpression cell models, while pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity reverses this phenotype. Furthermore, we show that LRRK2 mutations drive association of endocytosed transferrin with Rab8a-positive lysosomes. LRRK2 has been nominated as an integral part of cellular responses downstream of proinflammatory signals and is activated in microglia in postmortem PD tissue. Here, we show that iPSC-derived microglia from patients carrying the most common LRRK2 mutation, G2019S, mistraffic transferrin to lysosomes proximal to the nucleus in proinflammatory conditions. Furthermore, G2019S knock-in mice show a significant increase in iron deposition in microglia following intrastriatal LPS injection compared to wild-type mice, accompanied by striatal accumulation of ferritin. Our data support a role of LRRK2 in modulating iron uptake and storage in response to proinflammatory stimuli in microglia.",

    "abstract": "Impairment of autophagy has been strongly implicated in the progressive loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Transcription factor E3 (TFE3), an MiTF/TFE family transcription factor, has been identified as a master regulator of the genes that are associated with lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. However, whether TFE3 is involved in parkinsonian neurodegeneration remains to be determined. In this study, we found decreased TFE3 expression in the nuclei of the dopaminergic neurons of postmortem human PD brains. Next, we demonstrated that TFE3 knockdown led to autophagy dysfunction and neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in mice, implying that reduction of nuclear TFE3 may contribute to autophagy dysfunction-mediated cell death in PD. Further, we showed that enhancement of autophagy by TFE3 overexpression dramatically reversed autophagy downregulation and dopaminergic neurons loss in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of PD. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that TFE3 plays an essential role in maintaining autophagy and the survival of dopaminergic neurons, suggesting TFE3 activation may serve as a promising strategy for PD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Cognitive impairment is one of the key non-motor symptoms of PD, affecting both mortality and quality of life. However, there are few experimental studies on the pathology and treatments of PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and PD dementia (PDD) due to the lack of representative models. To identify new strategies for developing representative models, we systematically summarized previous studies on PD-MCI and PDD and compared differences between existing models and diseases. Our initial search identified 5432 articles, of which 738 were duplicates. A total of 227 articles met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Models fell into three categories based on model design: neurotoxin-induced, transgenic, and combined. Although the neurotoxin-induced experimental model was the most common type that was used during every time period, transgenic and combined experimental models have gained significant recent attention. Unfortunately, there remains a big gap between ideal and actual experimental models. While each model has its own disadvantages, there have been tremendous advances in the development of PD models of cognitive impairment, and almost every model can verify a hypothesis about PD-MCI or PDD. Finally, our proposed strategies for developing novel models are as follows: a set of plans that integrate symptoms, biochemistry, neuroimaging, and other objective indicators to judge and identify that the novel model plays a key role in new strategies for developing representative models; novel models should simulate different clinical features of PD-MCI or PDD; inducible \u03b1-Syn overexpression and SH-SY5Y-A53T cellular models are good candidate models of PD-MCI or PDD.",

    "abstract": "An increase in body weight is observed in the majority of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who undergo deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) although the mechanisms are unclear.\nTo identify the stimulation-dependent effects on reward-associated and attention-associated neural networks and to determine whether these alterations in functional connectivity are associated with the local impact of DBS on different STN parcellations.\nWe acquired functional task-related MRI data from 21 patients with PD during active and inactive STN DBS and 19 controls while performing a food viewing paradigm. Electrode placement in the STN was localised using a state-of-the-art approach. Based on the 3D model, the local impact of STN DBS was estimated.\nSTN DBS resulted in a mean improvement of motor function of 22.6%\u00b115.5% (on medication) and an increase of body weight of ~4 kg within 2 years of stimulation. DBS of the limbic proportion of the STN was associated with body weight gain and an increased functional connectivity within the salience network and at the same time with a decreased activity within the reward-related network in the context of sweet food images.\nOur findings indicate increased selective attention for high-caloric foods and a sweet food seeking-like behaviour after DBS particularly when the limbic proportion of the STN was stimulated.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsonism is one of the most common neurological disorders affecting the elderly. Several population-based studies have determined the epidemiology of parkinsonism, mainly Parkinson's disease (PD), but there is still little evidence in the Brazilian population. This protocol study aims to assess the prevalence and incidence of cases of PD and other parkinsonian syndromes in a 5-year cohort in a population-based study in the southern region of Brazil.\nA prospective population-based longitudinal study, with a cohort of development of cases of parkinsonism, divided into two phases: in phase I, two questionnaires to screen for parkinsonism (Tanner's questionnaire), Rapid Eyes Movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Single-Question Screen) and a short interview will be conducted with all elderly residents of Veran\u00f3polis (the first longevity Brazilian county located in the Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) aged 60 or over. The positive screened cases will be examined independently by at least two movement disorder-trained physicians and prevalence will be determined. A comprehensive evaluation of prodromic symptoms, risk factors and clinical characteristics will be carried out. Subjects with subtle parkinsonism and a sample of healthy subjects will be followed for 5 years in a developmental cohort of parkinsonism cases. For crude incidence, all individuals admitted at the beginning of the study will be re-evaluated.\nThe study was approved by the research ethics committee of the Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas de Porto Alegre (protocol n\u00b0 4.095.609). All participants provide their informed consent before evaluations. Findings from this survey will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and will be presented at conferences.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a long-term, complex health condition. To improve or maintain quality of life, people with Parkinson's can have an active involvement in their care through self-management techniques. Given the complexity and individualization of self-management, people with Parkinson's will need support and encouragement from their healthcare professionals (HCPs). Despite the key role HCPs have in this, research has seldom explored their perspectives and understanding of self-management for people with Parkinson's.\nMulti-disciplinary teams providing care for people with Parkinson's across London, Coventry and Hertfordshire were approached and took part in either one of four focus groups or individual interviews. Forty-two HCPs, including a range of specialist doctors, general practitioners, allied health professionals, nurses, and social workers, took part in this study. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis to identify themes.\nFour themes were developed from the data: 1) Empowerment of patients through holistic care and being person-centred; 2) Maximising motivation and capability for patients, for example using asset based approaches and increasing opportunities; 3) importance of empowerment of carers to support self-management and 4) contextual barriers to self-management such as the social context.\nThis study is the first to explore the perspectives of HCPs on self-management in people with Parkinson's. Our findings have identified important considerations surrounding empowerment, motivation, carers and contextual barriers to better understand how we enable effective self-management techniques in people with Parkinson's. Research should build on these findings on to develop acceptable and effective self-management tools for use in practice with people affected by Parkinson's.",

    "abstract": "The number of patients with Parkinson's disease among older adults is rapidly increasing. Such patients mostly take medication and require regular physician visits. However, the effect of physician visit frequency for the treatment for Parkinson's disease has not been evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of physician visit frequency for Parkinson's disease treatment on mortality, healthcare days, and healthcare and long-term care costs among older adults.\nThis study employed a retrospective cohort design utilizing claims data from the Fukuoka Prefecture Wide-Area Association of Latter-Stage Elderly Healthcare Insurance and Long-Term Care Insurance. Patients aged \u226575\u2009years who were newly diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2014 were included in this study, following the onset of Parkinson's disease to March 31, 2019. We calculated the restricted mean survival time to evaluate mortality, focusing on the frequency of physician visits for Parkinson's disease treatment. Inpatient days, outpatient days, and healthcare and long-term care costs per month were calculated using a generalized linear model.\nThere were 2224 participants, with 46.5% mortality among those with a higher frequency of physician visits and 56.4% among those with a lower frequency of physician visits. A higher frequency of physician visits was associated with a significant increase in survival time (1.57\u2009months at 24\u2009months and 5.00\u2009months at 60\u2009months) after the onset of Parkinson's disease and a decrease in inpatient days and healthcare costs compared to a lower frequency of physician visits.\nA higher frequency of physician visits was significantly associated with longer survival time, fewer inpatient days, and lower healthcare costs. Caregivers should support patients with Parkinson's disease to visit physicians regularly for their treatment.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait is a common phenomenon of advanced Parkinson's disease. Besides locomotor function per se, a role of cognitive deficits has been suggested. Limited evidence of associated dopaminergic deficits points to caudatal denervation. Further, altered functional connectivity within resting-state networks with importance for cognitive functions has been described in freezers. A potential pathophysiological link between both imaging findings has not yet been addressed. The current study sought to investigate the association between dopaminergic pathway dysintegrity and functional dysconnectivity in relation to FOG severity and cognitive performance in a well-characterized PD cohort undergoing high-resolution 6-[18F]fluoro-L-Dopa PET and functional MRI. The freezing of gait questionnaire was applied to categorize patients (n\u00a0=\u00a059) into freezers and non-freezers. A voxel-wise group comparison of 6-[18F]fluoro-L-Dopa PET scans with focus on striatum was performed between both well-matched and neuropsychologically characterized patient groups. Seed-to-voxel resting-state functional connectivity maps of the resulting dopamine depleted structures and dopaminergic midbrain regions were created and compared between both groups. For a direct between-group comparison of dopaminergic pathway integrity, a molecular connectivity approach was conducted on 6-[18F]fluoro-L-Dopa scans. With respect to striatal regions, freezers showed significant dopaminergic deficits in the left caudate nucleus, which exhibited altered functional connectivity with regions of the visual network. Regarding midbrain structures, the bilateral ventral tegmental area showed altered functional coupling to regions of the default mode network. An explorative examination of the integrity of dopaminergic pathways by molecular connectivity analysis revealed freezing-associated impairments in mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways. This study represents the first characterization of a link between dopaminergic pathway dysintegrity and altered functional connectivity in Parkinson's disease with freezing of gait and hints at a specific involvement of striatocortical and mesocorticolimbic pathways in freezers.",

    "abstract": "The sequelae of Parkinson's disease (PD) includes both motor- and cognitive-related symptoms. Although traditionally considered a subcortical disease, there is increasing evidence that PD has a major impact on cortical function as well. Prior studies have reported alterations in cortical neural function in patients with PD during movement, but to date such studies have not examined whether the complexity of multicomponent movements modulate these alterations. In this study, 23 patients with PD (medication \"off\" state) and 27 matched healthy controls performed simple and complex finger tapping sequences during magnetoencephalography (MEG), and the resulting MEG data were imaged to identify the cortical oscillatory dynamics serving motor performance. The patients with PD were significantly slower than controls at executing the sequences overall, and both groups took longer to complete the complex sequences than the simple. In terms of neural differences, patients also exhibited weaker beta complexity-related effects in the right medial frontal gyrus and weaker complexity-related alpha activity in the right posterior and inferior parietal lobules, suggesting impaired motor sequence execution. Characterizing the cortical pathophysiology of PD could inform current and future therapeutic interventions that address both motor and cognitive symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Psychosis is a prominent neuropsychiatric symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and is associated with negative outcomes, such as poorer quality of life and greater rate of functional impairment. Early identification of patients with PD at risk of developing psychosis facilitates appropriate management to improve outcomes. However, this phenomenon has not been examined locally. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of PD-associated psychosis in the local setting, identify any associated risk factors, as well as characterise the cognitive trajectory of patients with PD with psychosis.\nA retrospective cohort of 336 patients with PD, who presented to the National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore, in 2006 and 2007 and attended follow-up visits through to 2013 was analysed. The data analysed included scores from clinician assessments of cognitive function, disease severity and presence of psychotic symptoms, conducted when clinically appropriate during patients' medical visits. Survival analysis and logistic and linear regression analysis were performed.\nPsychosis was diagnosed in 63 patients with PD, indicating a prevalence of 18.8% for PD-associated psychosis. Incidence of psychosis in PD was calculated to be 40 per 1,000 person-years. No significant association was found between demographic variables and the odds of developing psychosis in PD. Regression analyses found that the presence of psychosis significantly predicted greater cognitive decline and disease severity.\nPsychosis has a significant presence among the PD population in Singapore, possibly serving as an indicator of more rapid cognitive decline and progression of PD severity.",

    "abstract": "This review gives an insight into the beginnings of dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging in the early 1990s, focussing on single photon emission tomography (SPECT). The development of the method and its consolidation as a now widely used clinical tool is described. The role of DAT-SPECT in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of PD, atypical parkinsonian syndromes and several other different neurological disorders is reviewed. Finally the clinical research using DAT-SPECT as a biomarker for the progression of PD, for the detection of a preclinical dopaminergic lesion and its correlation with neuropathological findings is outlined.",

    "abstract": "Evidence shows that metabolic syndrome (MS) is associated with a greater risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD) because of the increase in oxidative stress levels along with other factors such as neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, because some studies have reported that MS is associated with a lower risk of PD, the relationship between MS and PD should be investigated. This study aimed to investigate the effect of MS on PD. Two authors searched five electronic databases, namely, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Science Direct, for relevant articles between September and October 2020. After screening the title and abstract of all articles, 34 articles were selected for full-text review. Finally, 11 articles meeting the eligibility criteria were included in the study. The quality of articles was critically evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute. Overall, we evaluated data from 23,586,349 individuals (including healthy individuals, with MS and PD) aged 30 years or more. In cohort studies, the follow-up period varied between 2 and 30 years. MS contributed considerably to the increase in the incidence of PD. In addition, obesity, a component of MS, alone can increase the probability of developing neurodegenerative diseases. However, despite few studies on MS and PD, changes in cognitive function and more rapid progression of PD disease has been documented in patients with MS using methods commonly used in research.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation in Wolff\nWe report a case of a 43-year-old man with unremarkable cardiac history who presented due to sudden-onset feeling of palpitations and pre-syncope after strenuous lifting. Electrocardiography depicted fast pre-excited AF. The shortest pre-excited RR interval was estimated at 160 ms, indicating an accessory pathway (AP) with short antegrade refractory period at risk for mediating sudden cardiac death. Direct current cardioversion restored sinus rhythm unravelling delta waves. The patient was put on propafenone 450 mg/day having an uneventful clinical course. On Day 10 post-admission, electrophysiological study induced rapid AF but the shortest pre-excited RR interval was substantially increased to 264 ms. A left anterolateral AP was ablated. The patient remained symptom free until his latest follow-up in the 3rd-month post-ablation without manifest pre-excitation on the surface electrocardiogram.\nTreatment options of pre-excited AF include anti-arrhythmic agents but mainly electrical cardioversion. Cardioversion can safely restore sinus rhythm, while use of anti-arrhythmics often requires intensive care unit monitoring due to the risk of QT prolongation. Catheter ablation is the mainstay of therapy for symptomatic patients. Our rare report highlights the direct impact of propafenone on prolonging the refractoriness of the AP, effectively and safely, and reappraises propafenone's worthiness as a protective measure following pre-excited AF episode until ablation.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) share similar pathological mechanisms and risk factors.\nWe performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence for a relationship between IBS and PD. Risk estimates from individual studies were pooled using random-effects models.\nSix articles involving 58,645 patients with PD were included in our meta-analysis. The overall risk for PD in IBS patients was significantly higher than that in the general population (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-1.75; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed no significant differences in risk between men (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.47, 95% CI: 1.3-1.67; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and women (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.51, 95% CI: 1.29-1.75; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001); however, older (\u226565\u00a0years) IBS patients (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.44, 95% CI: 1.3-1.59; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) may be at higher risk for PD than younger (40-64\u00a0years) patients (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.64; p\u00a0=\u00a0.017).\nOverall, the PD risk was higher in IBS patients than others, indicating that the intestinal disorder may serve as a warning sign for PD.",

    "abstract": "What is the central question of this study? The respiratory frequency to hypercapnia is attenuated in an animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD): what is the therapeutic potential of inhibition of anandamide hydrolysis for this respiratory deficit? What is the main finding and its importance? In an animal model of PD there is an increased variability in resting respiratory frequency and an impaired tachypnoeic response to hypercapnia, which is accompanied by diminished expression of Phox2b immunoreactivity in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN). Inhibition of anandamide hydrolysis also impaired the response to hypercapnia and decreased the number of Phox2b immunoreactive cells in the RTN. This strategy does not reverse the respiratory deficits observed in an animal model of PD.\nParkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by severe classic motor symptoms along with various non-classic symptoms. Among the non-classic symptoms, respiratory dysfunctions are increasingly recognized as contributory factors to complications in PD. The endocannabinoid system has been proposed as a target to treat PD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Since symptom management of PD is mainly focused on the classic motor symptoms, in this work we aimed to test the hypothesis that increasing the actions of the endocannabinoid anandamide by inhibiting its hydrolysis with URB597 reverses the respiratory deficits observed in an animal model of PD. Results show that bilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine hydrochloride (6-OHDA) in the dorsal striatum leads to neurodegeneration of the substantia nigra, accompanied by reduced expression of Phox2b in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), an increase in resting respiratory frequency variability and an impaired tachypnoeic response to hypercapnia. URB597 treatment in control animals was associated with an impaired tachypnoeic response to hypercapnia and a reduced expression of Phox2b in the RTN, whereas treatment of 6-OHDA-lesioned animals with URB597 was not able to reverse the deficits observed. These results suggest that targeting anandamide may not be a suitable strategy to treat PD since this treatment mimics the respiratory deficits observed in the 6-OHDA model of PD.",

    "abstract": "For the last two decades, pathogenic concepts in Parkinson disease (PD) have revolved around the toxicity and spread of \u03b1-synuclein. Thus, \u03b1-synuclein would follow caudo-rostral propagation from the periphery to the central nervous system, first producing non-motor manifestations (such as constipation, sleep disorders and hyposmia), and subsequently impinging upon the mesencephalon to account for the cardinal motor features before reaching the neocortex as the disease evolves towards dementia. This model is the prevailing theory of the principal neurobiological mechanism of disease. Here, we scrutinize the temporal evolution of motor and non-motor manifestations in PD and suggest that, even though the postulated bottom-up mechanisms are likely to be involved, early involvement of the nigrostriatal system is a key and prominent pathophysiological mechanism. Upcoming studies of detailed clinical manifestations with newer neuroimaging techniques will allow us to more closely define, in vivo, the role of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates with respect to neuronal loss during the onset and progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) studies provide direct evidence of the important role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during walking in aging and Parkinson disease (PD). Most studies explored mean hemoglobin (HbO2) levels, while moment-to-moment variability measures have rarely been investigated. Variability measures can inform on flexibility, which is imperative for adaptive function. We hypothesized that patients with PD will show less variability in HbO2 signals during walking compared to healthy controls.\nTwo hundred six participants, 57 healthy controls (age 68.9 \u00b1 1.0 years, 27 women) and 149 patients with idiopathic PD (age 69.8 \u00b1 0.6 years, 50 women, disease duration 8.27 \u00b1 5.51 years), performed usual walking and dual-task walking (serial 3 subtractions) with an fNIRS sensor placed on the forehead. HbO2 variability was calculated from the SD, range, and mean detrended time series of fNIRS-derived HbO2 signal evaluated during each walking task. HbO2 variability was compared between groups and between walking tasks with mixed model analyses.\nHigher variability (SD, range, mean detrended time series) was observed during dual-task walking compared to usual walking (\nIn this study, we suggest a new way to interpret changes in HbO2 variability. We relate increased HbO2 variability to flexible adaptation to environmental challenges and decreased HbO2 variability to the stability of performance. Our results show that both are limited in PD; however, further investigation of these concepts is required. Moreover, HbO2 variability measures are an important aspect of brain function that add new insights into the role of PFC during walking with aging and PD.\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01732653.\nThis study provides Class III evidence that patients with PD have more variability within HbO2 signals during usual walking compared to healthy controls but not during dual-task walking.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive decline is commonly observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). Identifying PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) is crucial for early initiation of therapeutic interventions and preventing cognitive decline.\nWe aimed to develop a machine learning model trained with magnetic susceptibility values based on the multi-atlas label-fusion method to classify PD without dementia into PD-MCI and normal cognition (PD-CN).\nThis multicenter observational cohort study retrospectively reviewed 61 PD-MCI and 59 PD-CN cases for the internal validation cohort and 22 PD-MCI and 21 PD-CN cases for the external validation cohort. The multi-atlas method parcellated the quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) images into 20 regions of interest and extracted QSM-based magnetic susceptibility values. Random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting were selected as machine learning algorithms.\nAll classifiers demonstrated substantial performances in the classification task, particularly the random forest model. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for this model were 79.1%, 77.3%, 81.0%, and 0.78, respectively. The QSM values in the caudate nucleus, which were important features, were inversely correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (right caudate nucleus: r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.573, 95% CI: -0.801 to -0.298, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003; left caudate nucleus: r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.659, 95% CI: -0.894 to -0.392, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nMachine learning models trained with QSM values successfully classified PD without dementia into PD-MCI and PD-CN groups, suggesting the potential of QSM values as an auxiliary biomarker for early evaluation of cognitive decline in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed the close correlation between microRNAs (miRs) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of miR-124 in a PD mouse model.\nMiR-124 expression in human plasma was detected by qRT-PCR. PD mouse model was established by stereotactic injection of 6-hydroxydopmine. Lentivirus were used to deliver and overexpress miR-124 and Axin1 into the substantia nigra. Multiple behavioral tests and oxidative stress assays were carried out to access the protective effect of miR-124 against PD. Western blot and luciferase assay were conducted to dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms.\nMiR-124 expression was decreased in PD patients. Overexpression of miR-124 in PD mice could improve motor defects, ameliorate dopaminergic neurons loss, and reduce oxidative stress. Mechanistically, miR-124 targeted Axin1 directly, and then attenuated PD progression via suppressing Axin1 and activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathways in PD mice.\nMiR-124 is an important neuroprotective factor, which suppresses Axin1 and activates Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathways in PD mice.",

    "abstract": "Motor imagery (MI), defined as the ability to mentally represent an action without actual movement, has been used to improve motor function in athletes and, more recently, in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Several studies have investigated the neural correlates of motor imagery, which change also depending on the action imagined.\nThis review focuses on locomotion, which is a crucial activity in everyday life and is often impaired by neurological conditions. After a general discussion on the neural correlates of motor imagery and locomotion, we review the evidence highlighting the abnormalities in gait control and gait imagery in PD patients. Next, new perspectives and techniques for PD patients' rehabilitation are discussed, namely Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs), neurofeedback, and virtual reality (VR).\nDespite the few studies, the literature review supports the potential beneficial effects of motor imagery interventions in PD focused on locomotion. The development of new technologies could empower the administration of training based on motor imagery locomotor tasks, and their application could lead to new rehabilitation protocols aimed at improving walking ability in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) can produce postural abnormalities of the standing body position such as kyphosis. We investigated the effects of PD, deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), vision and adaptation on body position in a well-defined group of patients with PD in quiet standing and during balance perturbations. Ten patients with PD and 25 young and 17 old control participants were recruited. Body position was measured with 3D motion tracking of the ankle, knee, hip, shoulder and head. By taking the ankle as reference, we mapped the position of the joints during quiet standing and balance perturbations through repeated calf muscle vibration. We did this to explore the effect of PD, DBS in the STN, and vision on the motor learning process of adaptation in response to the repeated stimulus. We found that patients with PD adopt a different body position with DBS ON vs. DBS OFF, to young and old controls, and with eyes open vs. eyes closed. There was an altered body position in PD with greater flexion of the head, shoulder and knee (p\u22640.042) and a posterior position of the hip with DBS OFF (p\u22640.014). With DBS ON, body position was brought more in line with the position taken by control participants but there was still evidence of greater flexion at the head, shoulder and knee. The amplitude of movement during the vibration period decreased in controls at all measured sites with eyes open and closed (except at the head in old controls with eyes open) showing adaptation which contrasted the weaker adaptive responses in patients with PD. Our findings suggest that alterations of posture and greater forward leaning with repeated calf vibration, are independent from reduced movement amplitude changes. DBS in the STN can significantly improve body position in PD although the effects are not completely reversed. Patients with PD maintain adaptive capabilities by leaning further forward and reducing movement amplitude despite their kyphotic posture.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily characterized by the loss of dopaminergic cells and atrophy in subcortical regions. However, the impact of these pathological changes on large-scale dynamic integration and segregation of the cortex are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of subcortical dysfunction on cortical dynamics and cognition in PD. Spatiotemporal dynamics of the phase interactions of resting-state blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals in 159 PD patients and 152 normal control (NC) individuals were estimated. The relationships between subcortical atrophy, subcortical-cortical fiber connectivity impairment, cortical synchronization/metastability, and cognitive performance were then assessed. We found that cortical synchronization and metastability in PD patients were significantly decreased. To examine whether this is an effect of dopamine depletion, we investigated 45 PD patients both ON and OFF dopamine replacement therapy, and found that cortical synchronization and metastability are significantly increased in the ON state. The extent of cortical synchronization and metastability in the OFF state reflected cognitive performance and mediates the difference in cognitive performance between the PD and NC groups. Furthermore, both the thalamic volume and thalamocortical fiber connectivity had positive relationships with cortical synchronization and metastability in the dopaminergic OFF state, and mediate the difference in cortical synchronization between the PD and NC groups. In addition, thalamic volume also reflected cognitive performance, and cortical synchronization/metastability mediated the relationship between thalamic volume and cognitive performance in PD patients. Together, these results highlight that subcortical dysfunction and reduced dopamine levels are responsible for decreased cortical synchronization and metastability, further affecting cognitive performance in PD. This might lead to biomarkers being identified that can predict if a patient is at risk of developing dementia.",

    "abstract": "Excessive brain iron deposition is involved in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. However, the correlation of iron accumulation in various brain nuclei is not well-established in different stages of the disease. This cross-sectional study aims to evaluate quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) as an imaging technique to measure brain iron accumulation in PD patients in different stages compared to healthy controls.\nNinety-six PD patients grouped by their Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stages and 31 healthy controls were included in this analysis. The magnetic susceptibility values of the substantia nigra (SN), red nucleus (RN), caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus were obtained and compared.\nIron level was increased in the SN of PD patients in all stages versus controls (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), with no significant difference within stages. Iron in the RN was significantly increased in stage II versus controls (p\u00a0=\u00a0.013) and combined stages III and IV versus controls (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The iron levels in caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus were not different between any groups.\nOur data suggest iron accumulation occurs early in the disease course and only in the SN and RN of these patients. This is a large cross-sectional study of brain iron deposition in PD patients according to H&Y staging. Prospective studies are warranted to further validate QSM as a method to follow brain iron, which could serve as a disease biomarker and a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Despite a rapid increase in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) in China, studies focusing on caregiver burden remain scarce. Challenges faced by caregivers in other Asian societies are also underexplored in the PD-related research field. To addresses this gap, this study drew on the theory of resilience and examined the caregiving experiences of Chinese family caregivers for older people with PD. We conducted participant observation and semi-structured interviews with 15 family caregivers of older people with PD in Shanghai in 2018. We used thematic analysis to identify key patterns of stressors and factors affecting the capacity of caregivers to address burdens. Our analysis shows that stressors faced by Chinese PD caregivers included physical limitations, psychological and emotional problems, reduction in social connections, financial burden and lack of information and knowledge. Three levels of factors-personal, social and structural-played different roles in resilience among Chinese PD caregivers. However, resilience was unevenly developed among PD caregivers across gender, kinship, residential status and generation. Our study provides novel empirical evidence about the burden on Chinese PD caregivers. It can inform policymakers and social workers as they develop a holistic understanding of promoting resilience building in this rapidly growing group. Our study also enriches cross-cultural knowledge about factors contributing to caregivers' resilience building in Asian societies.",

    "abstract": "Nano-drug delivery systems may potentially overcome current challenges in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) by enabling targeted delivery and more efficient blood-brain penetration ability. This study investigates novel gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to be used as delivery systems for L-DOPA and dopamine by considering their binding capabilities in the presence and absence of a model protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA). Four different AuNPs were prepared by surface functionalization with polyethylene glycol (PEG), 1-adamantylamine (Ad), 1-adamantylglycine (AdGly), and peptidoglycan monomer (PGM). Fluorescence and UV-Vis measurements demonstrated the strongest binding affinity and L-DOPA/dopamine loading efficiency for PGM-functionalized AuNPs with negligible impact of the serum protein presence. Thermodynamic analysis revealed a spontaneous binding process between L-DOPA or dopamine and AuNPs that predominantly occurred through van der Waals interactions/hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions. These results represent PGM-functionalized AuNPs as the most efficient at L-DOPA and dopamine binding with a potential to become a drug-delivery system for neurodegenerative diseases. Detailed investigation of L-DOPA/dopamine interactions with different AuNPs was described here for the first time. Moreover, this study highlights a cost- and time-effective methodology for evaluating drug binding to nanomaterials.",

    "abstract": "Previous estimates of life-threatening event (LTE) risk in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome are limited by selection bias inherent to tertiary care referral-based cohorts.\nThis analysis sought to measure LTE incidence in children with WPW syndrome in a large contemporary representative population.\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted using claims data from the IBM MarketScan Research Databases, evaluating subjects with WPW syndrome (age 1-18 years) from any encounter between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2018. Subjects with congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathy were excluded. The primary outcome was diagnosis of ventricular fibrillation (VF); a composite outcome, LTE, was defined as occurrence of VF and/or cardiac arrest. VF and LTE rates were compared to matched representative controls without WPW syndrome (3:1 ratio).\nThe prevalence of WPW syndrome was 0.03% (8733/26,684,581) over a median follow-up of 1.6 years (interquartile range 0.7-2.9 years). Excluding congenital heart disease/cardiomyopathy, 6946 subjects were analyzed. An LTE occurred in 49 subjects (0.7%), including VF in 20 (0.3%). The incidence of VF was 0.8 events per 1000 person-years, and the incidence of LTE was 1.9 events per 1000 person-years. There were no occurrences of VF in controls; the rate of LTE was 70 times higher in subjects with WPW syndrome (0.7%; 95% confidence interval 0.5%-0.9%) than in controls (0.01%; 95% confidence interval 0%-0.02%).\nThe use of a large claims data set\u00a0allowed for an evaluation of VF and LTE risk in an unselected pediatric population with WPW syndrome. The observed range of 0.8-1.9 events per 1000 person-years is consistent with prior reports from selected populations. A comparison of event rates to matched controls confirms and quantifies the significant elevation in VF and LTE risk in pediatric WPW syndrome.",

    "abstract": "A classic method to evaluate autonomic dysfunction is through the evaluation of heart rate variability (HRV). HRV provides a series of coefficients, such as Standard Deviation of n-n intervals (SDNN) and Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD), which have well-established physiological associations. However, using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, it is difficult to identify proper autonomic activity, and the standard techniques are not sensitive and robust enough to distinguish pure autonomic modulation in heart dynamics from cardiac dysfunctions. In this proof-of-concept study we propose the use of Poincar\u00e9 mapping and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) to identify and characterize stochasticity and chaoticity dynamics in ECG recordings. By applying these non-linear techniques in the ECG signals recorded from a set of Parkinson's disease (PD) animal model 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), we showed that they present less variability in long time epochs and more stochasticity in short-time epochs, in their autonomic dynamics, when compared with those of the sham group. These results suggest that PD animal models present more \"rigid heart rate\" associated with \"trembling ECG\" and bradycardia, which are direct expressions of Parkinsonian symptoms. We also compared the RQA factors calculated from the ECG of animal models using four computational ECG signals under different noise and autonomic modulatory conditions, emulating the main ECG features of atrial fibrillation and QT-long syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence shows that the typical motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are often accompanied, if not preceded, by cognitive dysfunctions that are potentially linked to further complications of the disease. Notably, these cognitive dysfunctions appear to have a significant impact in the domain of action processing, as indicated by specific impairments for action-related stimuli in general, and verbs in particular. In this mini-review, we focus on the use of the action fluency test as a tool to investigate action processing, in PD patients. We discuss the current results within the embodied cognition framework and in relation to general action-related impairments in PD, while also providing an outlook on open issues and possible avenues for future research. We argue that jointly addressing action semantic processing and motor dysfunctions in PD patients could pave the way to interventions where the motor deficits are addressed to improve both motor and communicative skills since the early disease stages, with a likely significant impact on quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Opicapone is a catechol-O-methyl-transferase (iCOMT) inhibitor authorized in Europe in 2016 and indicated as adjunctive therapy to preparations of levodopa/ DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors in adult patients with Parkinson's disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations who cannot be stabilised on those combinations. The efficacy of opicapone in these patients has been demonstrated in two pivotal randomized clinical trials, BIPARK I and BIPARK II, in which it has demonstrated its superiority versus placebo and non-inferiority versus entacapone. Although they constitute the gold standard for the evaluation of interventions, randomized clinical trials present limitations of external validity due to the use of strict eligibility criteria. Therefore, it is considered necessary to have a more comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of the drug, complementing the information obtained from randomized clinical trials with that of \"real world or real clinical practice\" studies. The objective of this review has been to collect and put into perspective the information available on opicapone coming from real clinical practice studies in Spain. The data from Spain with opicapone in 18 series with more than 1,000 patients in total, confirm the safety and efficacy previously reported with this iCOMT. Furthermore, they show that opicapone is especially useful in patients with a less advanced stage of the disease and mild motor fluctuations, which would suggest that the earlier its introduction in the therapeutic scheme for the management of motor fluctuations, the better is the benefit-risk ratio for the drug.\nOpicapona para el tratamiento de la enfermedad de Parkinson: datos de vida real en Espa\u00f1a.\nResumen. La opicapona es un inhibidor de la catecol-O-metiltransferasa (iCOMT) autorizado en Europa en 2016 como terapia adyuvante a las preparaciones de levodopa/inhibidores de la dopa descarboxilasa en pacientes adultos con enfermedad de Parkinson y fluctuaciones motoras de final de dosis que no puedan ser estabilizados con esas combinaciones. La eficacia de la opicapona en estos pacientes ha sido demostrada en dos ensayos cl\u00ednicos pivotales, BIPARK I y BIPARK II, en los que se ha demostrado la superioridad frente al placebo y la no inferioridad frente a la entacapona. A pesar de que constituyen el est\u00e1ndar para la evaluaci\u00f3n de intervenciones, los ensayos cl\u00ednicos aleatorizados presentan limitaciones de validez externa debidas a la utilizaci\u00f3n de criterios estrictos de elegibilidad. Por tanto, se considera necesario disponer de una evaluaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s amplia de la eficacia general del f\u00e1rmaco, complementando la informaci\u00f3n de los ensayos cl\u00ednicos aleatorizados con estudios de \u2018vida real o pr\u00e1ctica cl\u00ednica real\u2019. El objetivo de esta revisi\u00f3n ha sido recopilar y poner en perspectiva la informaci\u00f3n disponible sobre los resultados de la opicapona en estudios de pr\u00e1ctica cl\u00ednica real en Espa\u00f1a. Los datos acumulados en Espa\u00f1a con opicapona en 18 series con m\u00e1s de 1.000 pacientes confirman la seguridad y la eficacia de este iCOMT comunicadas previamente. Adem\u00e1s, muestran que la opicapona es especialmente \u00fatil en pacientes en un estadio de la enfermedad menos avanzado y fluctuaciones motores leves, lo que sugerir\u00eda una mejor relaci\u00f3n beneficio-riesgo cuanto m\u00e1s temprana sea su introducci\u00f3n en el esquema terap\u00e9utico para el tratamiento de las fluctuaciones motoras.",

    "abstract": "The phenotype of the disease depends not only on the prevalence of certain motor signs, but also on non-motor symptoms. Determination of different profiles of Parkinson's disease improves disease prognosis and management. A clinical study was conducted in patients with Parkinson's disease. For this purpose, 64 patients with various motor subtypes of the disease were examined. Diagnosis was made according to the UK Brain Bank Criteria. The patients were divided into groups according to the motor subtype verified by the results of interference electroneuromyography. In each group, demographic data were collected, staging according to the Hoehn-Yahr scale and the overall score of the unified UPDRS scale were studied. The study of gait was evaluated using the Nonmotor Symptom Rating Scale for Parkinson's Disease (NMSS). The Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) was used to determine sleep onset, wake-up time, sleep duration, mid-sleep, average sleep duration, average weekly light exposure, chronotype, and for working patients, relative jet lag and average weekly sleep deficit. Circadian rhythm disorders were diagnosed according to the international classification of sleep disorders-3. Patients with Parkinson's disease have a more characteristic evening chronotype and a shorter sleep duration due to late sleep onset. On the other hand, the tendency towards the morning or evening chronotype is not associated with the severity of the disease or the level of daytime sleepiness. It was found that PD patients are characterized by more pronounced disorders of the gastrointestinal, genitourinary systems, sleep and cognitive-affective disorders, and others. In patients with a mixed motor subtype, mood and cognitive impairments are more pronounced, and gait disorders are more pronounced in patients with a mixed motor subtype. Thus, different motor subtypes of Parkinson's disease have differences in the severity of motor manifestations and features of the circadian rhythm. Circadian dysregulation is associated with features of daily functioning and disorders of the motor sphere.",

    "abstract": "Management of PD has largely been affected by COVID-19. Due to the restrictions posed by COVID-19, there has been a shift from in-person to online forms of assessment. This presents a challenge as not all motor symptoms can be assessed virtually. Two of the four cardinal symptoms of PD (rigidity and postural instability) cannot be assessed virtually using the gold-standard Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III). As a result, an accurate total motor severity score can not be computed from the remaining subsections. Recently, one study stated that in order for accurate scores to be calculated, only three sections could be absent. Virtually, six sections are unable to be evaluated with online assessments. This inability to compute a total motor severity score may result in poor disease management. Thus, in this study a regression equation was developed to predict total motor severity scores from partial scores.\nTotal motor severity scores (UPDRS-III) from N\u00a0=\u00a0234 individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's were retrospectively analyzed. In order to conduct a linear regression analysis predictor and outcome variables were created. The variables were then used for the linear regression. The equation was then tested on an independent data set N\u00a0=\u00a01168.\nThe regression analysis resulted in the equation to predict total motor symptom severity of PD.\nIn conclusion, the developed equation will be very useful for outreach in rural communities, as well as the continued remote management of PD during COVID-19 and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic DBS in Parkinson's disease has been associated with cognitive decline in few cases. Volume reduction of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) seems to precede cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. In this retrospective study, we evaluated NBM volume as a predictor of cognitive outcome 1 year after subthalamic DBS.\nNBM volumes were calculated from preoperative MRIs using voxel-based morphometry. Cognitive outcome was defined as the relative change of MMSE or DemTect scores from pre-to 1 year postoperatively. A multiple linear regression analysis adjusted for the number of cognitive domains affected in the preoperative neuropsychological testing and UPDRS III was conducted. To account for other variables and potential non-linear effects, an additional machine learning analysis using random forests was applied.\n55 patients with Parkinson's disease (39 male, age 61.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.5 years, disease duration 10.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7 years) who received bilateral subthalamic DBS electrodes at our center were included. Although overall cognition did not change significantly, individual change in cognitive abilities was variable. Cognitive outcome could be predicted based on NBM size (B\u00a0=\u00a0208.98, p\u00a0=\u00a00.022*) in the regression model (F(3,49)\u00a0=\u00a02.869; R\nNBM volume can be used as a simple non-invasive predictor for cognitive outcome after DBS in Parkinson's disease, especially when combined with other clinical parameters that are prognostically relevant.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) may have differential effects on cardinal motor signs of Parkinson's disease (PD) in the upper and lower extremities. In addition, sites of maximally effective DBS for each sign and extremity may be distinct. Our study seeks to elucidate these structure-function relationships.\nWe applied an ordinary least squares linear regression model to measure motor effects of STN DBS on upper (UE) and lower (LE) extremity tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. We then applied an atlas-independent electrical-field model to identify sites of maximally effective stimulation for each sign and each extremity. Distances between sites and statistical power to resolve differences were calculated.\nIn our study population (n\u00a0=\u00a078 patients), STN DBS improved all cardinal motor signs (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.64, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Improvement magnitudes were tremor\u00a0>\u00a0rigidity\u00a0>\u00a0bradykinesia. Effects of STN DBS on UE versus LE signs were statistically equal for tremor and bradykinesia, but greater for UE rigidity than LE rigidity (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.19, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). UE maximal-effect loci were lateral, anterior, and dorsal to LE loci, but were not statistically resolved, despite sufficient statistical power to resolve differences of \u22640.48\u00a0mm (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) between maximally effective loci of stimulation.\nSTN DBS produces differential effects on UE and LE rigidity, but not for tremor or bradykinesia. This finding is not explained by distinct UE and LE loci of maximally effective stimulation. Instead, we hypothesize that downstream effects of STN DBS on motor networks and limb biomechanics are responsible for observed differences in UE and LE responses.",

    "abstract": "There is a considerable variation in the reported frequency of dementia in Parkinson's disease (PDD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of PDD reported in published studies and to examine the different methodological, clinical, and demographic factors that may contribute to this variation.\nWe conducted a systematic review, searching EMBASE and MEDLINE databases for relevant articles on PDD frequency published before May 2019. A global estimation of PDD was calculated. Different subgroup analyses were performed for methodological, clinical, and demographic characteristics. Meta-regression was also conducted to identify any significant differences within the subgroups.\nWe included 295 studies. The global pooled dementia frequency was 26.3%. These estimations varied according to methodological (14%-55%), clinical (18%-46%), and demographic (21%-43%) variables. The declared primary objective of the studies (to study PDD), the follow-up length (\u22657\u00a0years), the age of the participants (\u226575\u00a0years), Parkinson's disease (PD) duration (>10\u00a0years), and the Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage (>3) were important factors affecting reported dementia frequency.\nThis systematic review found that approximately one-quarter of the PD patients were diagnosed with PDD. Dementia frequency varied according to methodological, clinical and demographic variables. We cannot examine PDD frequency without considering all these variables that have an impact on it.",

    "abstract": "Psychosis is one of the incapacitating nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although several risk factors that include older age, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, depression, and cognitive dysfunction have been identified, the exact neural correlates remain elusive. As cognitive impairment has a close association with psychosis in PD, it is useful to know the spectrum of cognitive impairment in PD patients with psychosis (PD-P).\nThis cross-sectional study compared various cognitive parameters of PD-P (visual/minor hallucinations) and PD patients with no psychosis (PD-NP). A neuropsychological battery encapsulating several cognitive domains (executive, visuospatial, learning, and memory) was used for the cognitive assessment of 37 PD-P and 51 PD-NP patients who were matched for age, gender, education, and disease duration.\nThe two groups were comparable in terms of disease severity and stage. Although the groups had a comparable mean score on Montreal cognitive assessment, the PD-P group performed poorly in tests focused on executive function (color trail test, forward digit span), verbal learning and memory (Rey auditory and verbal learning test), and visuospatial functions (complex figure test, corsi block tapping test). Those with complex visual hallucinations performed poorly in the color trial test (part A) compared to those with minor hallucinations.\nPsychosis is associated with a multidomain cognitive dysfunction in PD. All PD patients should undergo detailed cognitive assessment as cognitive dysfunction may be a marker of psychosis in the future. Additional longitudinal studies are warranted to obtain detailed insights into this issue.\nLa psychose est l\u2019un des sympt\u00f4mes non moteurs d\u00e9bilitants de la maladie de Parkinson (MP). Certes, plusieurs facteurs de risque de psychose, notamment un \u00e2ge avanc\u00e9, le trouble du comportement en sommeil paradoxal (TCSP), la d\u00e9pression et le dysfonctionnement cognitif, ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 cern\u00e9s, mais les corr\u00e9lats neuraux exacts entre ces manifestations restent obscurs. Comme le d\u00e9ficit cognitif est en association \u00e9troite avec la psychose dans la MP, il serait bon de conna\u00eetre le spectre des troubles cognitifs chez les patients souffrant de la MP aussi atteints de psychose.\nIl s\u2019agit d\u2019une \u00e9tude transversale dans laquelle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 compar\u00e9s diff\u00e9rents param\u00e8tres cognitifs chez des patients atteints de la MP (hallucinations visuelles/l\u00e9g\u00e8res) (MPP), psychotiques, et chez des patients atteints de la MP, non psychotiques (MPNP). Les sujets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 une batterie de tests neuropsychologiques qui englobaient plusieurs domaines cognitifs (fonctions ex\u00e9cutives et visuospatiales, apprentissage, m\u00e9moire) visant \u00e0 \u00e9valuer les fonctions cognitives; 37 participants \u00e9taient de type MPP, et 51, de type MPNP, tous appari\u00e9s selon l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, le degr\u00e9 d\u2019instruction et la dur\u00e9e de la maladie.\nLes deux groupes \u00e9taient comparables quant au degr\u00e9 de gravit\u00e9 de la maladie et au stade d\u2019\u00e9volution. Bien que les sujets dans les deux groupes aient obtenu un score moyen comparable au test Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA; test d\u2019\u00e9valuation cognitive de Montr\u00e9al), ceux du groupe MPP ont \u00e9t\u00e9 peu performants dans les fonctions ex\u00e9cutives (test de traits de couleur [\nLa psychose est associ\u00e9e \u00e0 un dysfonctionnement cognitif qui touche plusieurs domaines dans la MP.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges for timely outcome assessment in randomized clinical trials (RCT). Our aim was to describe our remote neurocognitive testing (NCT) protocol administered by telephone in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).\nWe studied PD patients with OSA and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score \u2264 27 participating in a RCT assessing OSA treatment impact on cognition. Trial outcomes included change in MoCA and specific cognitive domains from baseline to 3 and 6\u2009months. With COVID19 pandemic-related restrictions, 3-month visits were converted from in-person to telephone administration with materials mailed to participants for compatible tests and retrieved by courier the same day. In exploratory analyses, we compared baseline vs. 3-month results in the control arm, which were not expected to change significantly (test-re-test), using a paired t-test and assessed agreement with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).\nSeven participants were approached and agreed to remote NCT at 3-month follow-up. Compared to the in-person NCT control arm group, they were younger (60.6 versus 70.6\u2009years) and had a shorter disease course (3.9 versus 9.2\u2009years). Remote NCT data were complete. The mean test-retest difference in MoCA was similar for in-person and remote NCT control-arm groups (between group difference - 0.69; 95%CI - 3.67, 2.29). Agreement was good for MOCA and varied for specific neurocognitive tests.\nTelephone administration of the MoCA and a modified neurocognitive battery is feasible in patients with PD and OSA. Further validation will require a larger sample size.",

    "abstract": "Impaired brain energy metabolism is a key feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Terazosin (TZ) binds phosphoglycerate kinase 1 and stimulates its activity, which enhances glycolysis and increases ATP levels. Preclinical and epidemiologic data suggest that TZ may be neuroprotective in PD. We aimed to assess target engagement and safety of TZ in people with PD.\nWe performed a 12-week pilot study in people with PD. Participants were randomized to receive 5\u00a0mg TZ or placebo. Participants and study personnel were blinded. We assessed TZ target engagement by measuring brain ATP with \nThirteen participants were randomized. Mild dizziness/lightheadedness was more common in the TZ group, and three participants taking TZ dropped out because of dizziness and/or orthostatic hypotension. Compared to the placebo group, the TZ group had a significant increase in the ratio of \u03b2ATP to inorganic phosphate in the brain. The TZ group also had a significant increase in blood ATP levels compared to the placebo group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).\nThis pilot study suggests that TZ may engage its target and change ATP levels in the brain and blood of people with PD. Further studies may be warranted to test the disease-modifying potential of TZ.",

    "abstract": "The role of serum cholesterol in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the association between serum cholesterol and PD in a cohort of statin-free newly diagnosed PD patients.\nThis retrospective study used fasting lipid profiles obtained from 672 consecutive statin-free newly diagnosed PD individuals and 540 controls. These PD individuals were identified from three medical institutions during 2017-2021, and the controls were identified from three physical examination centers during the same time period. Logistic regressions were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with adjustment of age, sex, and tobacco use history.\nAmong 672 PD individuals, 112 were excluded in accordance with the current criteria, leaving 560 PD patients. The multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that LDL-C was the only variable contributing to the occurrence of PD (OR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.07-2.31, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) after adjusting for age, sex, and tobacco use history; this association persisted following further adjustment for TC and HDL-C. In the subgroup analysis of the adjusted results of LDL-C after correcting for TC and HDL-C, lower LDL-C was associated with a higher risk of PD.\nAmong selected populations of statin-free newly diagnosed PD individuals, low LDL-C might be associated with the occurrence of PD.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the outcome following continuous tactile biofeedback of voice sound level administered, with a portable voice accumulator to individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nNine out of 16 participants with PD completed a 4-week intervention program where biofeedback of voice sound level was administered with the portable voice accumulator VoxLog during speech in daily life. The feedback, a tactile vibration signal from the device, was activated when the wearer used a voice sound level below an individually predetermined threshold level, reminding the wearer to increase voice sound level during speech. Voice use was registered in daily life with the VoxLog during the intervention period as well as during one baseline week, one follow-up week post intervention and 1 week 3 months post intervention. Self-to-other ratio (SOR), which is the difference between voice sound level and environmental noise, was studied in multiple noise ranges.\nA significant increase in SOR across all noise ranges of 2.28 dB (SD: 0.55) was seen for participants with scores above the cut-off for normal function (>26 points) on the cognitive screening test Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (n = 5). No significant increase was seen for the group of participants with MoCA scores below 26 (n = 4). Forty-four percent ended their participation early, all which scored below 26 on MoCA (n = 7).\nBiofeedback administered in daily life regarding voice level may help individuals with PD to increase their voice sound level in relation to environmental noise in daily life, but only for a limited subset. Only participants with normal cognitive function as screened by MoCA improved their voice sound level in relation to environmental noise.",

    "abstract": "Late-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) often presents with neuropsychiatric symptoms such as dementia, psychosis, excessive daytime sleepiness, apathy, depression, and anxiety. However, neuropsychiatric symptoms are the cardinal features of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), raising the possibility that CJD may be an overlooked condition when it accompanies late-stage PD.\nWe describe a female autopsy case of PD with a typical clinical course of 17 years, in which CJD overlapped with PD during the final year of the patient's life. The patient died aged 85 years. Neuropathological features included widespread Lewy body-related \u03b1-synucleinopathy predominantly in the brainstem and limbic system, as well as the typical pathology of methionine/methionine type 1 CJD in the brain.\nOur case demonstrates the clinicopathological co-occurrence of PD and CJD in a sporadic patient. The possibility of mixed pathology, including prion pathology, should be taken into account when neuropsychiatric symptoms are noted during the disease course of PD.",

    "abstract": "Handwriting skills could be highly impaired in patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD), and for this reason its analysis had always been considered relevant. In handwriting assessment, Archimedes spiral drawing is one of the most proposed tasks, due to its peculiar shape and ease of execution. In the last decades, digitizing tablets had been widely employed for the evaluation of the spiral performance, providing a cheap and non-invasive way to gather quantitative information, to be combined with the classical clinical examination. Despite this advantage, such approach cannot easily be adopted in an unsupervised scenario and lacks the natural feel of the traditional pen-and-paper approach. This work aims at overcoming these limitations by employing a smart ink pen, designed to write on paper and instrumented with inertial and force sensors, to automatically collect data related to spiral drawing execution of PD patients (n=30) and age-matched healthy controls (n=30). From the raw data, several time and frequency domains features were extracted and compared between the groups. The statistical analysis revealed some significant differences, showing less smooth acceleration and force profiles for PD patients. However, given the heterogeneous symptoms presented by the PD cohort, a detailed analysis of exemplifying PD patients was conducted, showing the ability of Archimedes spiral drawing to capture and quantify PD characteristic features.Clinical Relevance- Among the first clinical manifestations of the pathology, handwriting impairment appears in PD patients. It is often underestimated and not investigated properly. This easy-to-use tool could be very useful as a large-scale screening, but also for treatment efficacy evaluation and for the identification of PD subgroups.",

    "abstract": "Stair ambulation is commonplace in daily living activities, yet biomechanically more challenging compared to level-ground walking. With reduced lower-limb muscle strength and increased rigidity of extremities, people with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience impaired balance and higher incidence of falls each year. However, the regulation of whole-body dynamic balance of individuals with PD in stair walking is unclear. Whole-body angular momentum (H) is a useful metric for assessing dynamic balance that accounts for the angular movements of all body segments about the body center-of-mass (COM). In this study we investigated the regulation of H and segmental contributions to H during stair ascent and descent walking in individuals with PD compared to healthy subjects. During stair descent, the magnitude of sagittal-plane H increased in participants with PD compared to healthy subjects in ipsilateral (most affected side) leg stance. Meanwhile, the legs contributed more to sagittal-plane H in individuals with PD compared to healthy subjects. During stair descent walking, the magnitude of transverse-plane H was also greater in participants with PD compared to healthy subjects during the second half of ipsilateral leg gait cycle. The increased magnitude of negative (i.e., forward) sagittal-plane H in the ipsilateral stance of stair descent walking suggests that individuals with PD experience greater difficulties maintaining their forward rotation during such tasks.",

Visual cues, such as the laser, have been confirmed to improve kinematic performance and alleviate FOG incidences. However, the muscular effect is unknown. In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of visual cues on muscular activity in the lower limbs of PD patients with FOG. Surface EMG signals of the tibialis anterior (TA), lateral gastrocnemius (GL), rectus femoris (RF), and biceps femoris (BF) muscles were collected from eight patients (FOGer) and eight healthy elderly (HC) in both normal walking and walking with laser cues. Results showed that visual cues improved FOGer's muscular activation pattern towards normal. The RMS of TA was significantly increased in the loading response phase (p=0.02) and decreased in the pre-swing phase for FOGer (p=0.005) under visual cue. The RMS of GL in FOGer was considerably reduced in the loading response phase (p<0.001) and increased in the pre-swing phase (p=0.008) of their gait cycle. A significant strong correlation was also observed between the decrement in GL RMS during the loading response phase and the increment in GL RMS during the pre-swing phase (R=-0.952, p<0.001) incurred by visual cue in FOGer. These results indicate that the visual cues can help FOGer to modulate their muscular activation of ankle muscles, especially to normalize GL's activation distribution during stance. For clinical purposes, future rehabilitative strategies aimed at the modulation of ankle muscles are suggested.",

This paper presents an evaluation of indices extracted from electroencephalography and Heart Rate Variability (HRV), when used to classify a sample of subjects from three groups: control (healthy), medicated and non medicated subjects diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Classification performance was measured using accuracy over these classes and a cross validation scheme was used to assess repeatability for the classification process. Results tend to prove that inclusion of an autonomic index derived from HRV analysis enhances classification, suggesting that Parkinson's disease could be related with unperceptible to mild alterations of the Autonomic Nervous System.",

Studying the relation between Band Power time series (BPts) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV), has been proposed as a tool to explore the bidirectional communication pathways between cortex and autonomic control. This work presents a primer analysis on study brain \u2194 heart interaction on a databse of PD patients under two conditions: without and after levadopa (L-dopa) intake. Additionally a healthy control population was also analyzed, and used as comparison level between both conditions. Results show PD affects pathways by reducing the number of connections, specially association of beta and power and the second faster component of HRV seems to be more sensitive to L-dopa administration.",

Currently, the best response to interventions is achieved when the disease is diagnosed at an early stage. Supervised machine learning models are a common approach to assist early diagnosis from clinical data, but their performance is highly dependent on available example data and selected input features. In this study, we explore 23 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) image features for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease on 646 subjects. We achieve 94 % balanced classification accuracy in independent test data using the full feature space and show that matching accuracy can be achieved with only eight features, including original features introduced in this study. All the presented features can be generated using a routinely available clinical software and are therefore straightforward to extract and apply.",

Postural instability is one of the primary motor symptoms of PD and contributes to falls. Measurement of postural sway through center of pressure (COP) data might be an objective indicator of Parkinson's disease. The goal of this work is to use machine learning to evaluate if different features of postural sway can differentiate PD patients from healthy controls. Time domain, frequency domain, time-frequency, and structural features were extracted from COP data collected from 19 PD patients and 13 healthy controls (HC). The calculated parameters were input to various machine-learning models to classify PD and HC. Random Forest outperformed the rest of the classifiers in terms of accuracy, false negative rate, F1-score, and precision. Time domain features had the best performance in differentiating PD from HC compared to other feature groups.",

A sample of 40 participants with PD were staged between the stages of the disease using Hoehn and Yahr Modified Scale 1.5 to 3.0 in static posture with eyes open and closed to assess stabilometry in the distance from the center of pressure (CoP), as well as anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral axis (ML). There were found no differences in the body oscillation variables on the AP and ML axis. There was a difference in CoP displacement and oscillation speed between stage 1.5 to 3.0. It was concluded that participants with PD in stage 3.0 had greater distances from the CoP and greater speed of body sway, and that these instabilities become more evident with the progression of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease presenting with both motor and non-motor symptoms. Among PD motor symptoms, gait impairments are common and evolve over time. PD motor symptoms severity can be evaluated using clinical scales such as the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Rating Scale part III (MDS-UPDRS-III), which depend on the patient's status at the time of assessment and are limited by subjectivity. Objective quantification of motor symptoms (i.e. gait) with wearable technology paired with Deep Learning (DL) techniques could help assess motor severity. The aims of this study were to: (i) apply DL techniques to wearable-based gait data to estimate MDS-UPDRS-III scores; (ii) test the DL approach on longitudinal dataset to predict the progression of MDS-UPDRSIII scores. PD gait was measured in the laboratory, during a 2 minute continuous walk, with a sensor positioned on the lower back. A DL Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on 70 PD subjects (mean disease duration: 3.5 years), validated on 58 subjects (mean disease duration: 5 years) and tested on 46 subjects (mean disease duration: 6.5 years). Model performance was evaluated on longitudinal data by quantifying the association (Pearson correlation (r)), absolute agreement (Intraclass correlation (ICC)) and mean absolute error between the predicted and true MDS-UPDRS-III. Results showed that MDS-UPDRS-III scores predicted with the proposed model, strongly correlated (r=0.82) and had a good agreement (ICC(2,1)=0.76) with true values; the mean absolute error for the predicted MDS-UPDRS-III scores was 6.29 points. The results from this study are encouraging and show that a DL-CNN model trained on baseline wearable-based gait data could be used to assess PD motor severity after 3 years.Clinical Relevance-Gait assessed with wearable technology paired with DL-CNN can estimate PD motor symptom severity and progression to support clinical decision making.",

    "abstract": "Continuous monitoring of patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) is critical for their effective management, as early detection of improvement or degradation signs play an important role on pharmaceutical and/or interventional plans. Within this work, a group of seven PD patients and a group of ten controls performed a set of exercises related to the evaluation of PD gait. Plantar pressure signals were collected and used to derive a set of analytics. Statistical tests and feature selection approaches revealed that the spatial distribution of the Center of Pressure during a static balance exercise is the most discriminative analytic and may be used for every-day monitoring of the patients. Results have revealed that out of the 28 features extracted from the collected signals, 10 were statistically significant (p < 0.05) and can be used to machine learning algorithms and/or similar approaches.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) manifests with the appearance of non-motor symptoms before motor symptoms onset. Among these, dysfunctioning visual structures have recently been reported to occur at early disease stages.\nThis study addresses effective connectivity in the visual network of PD patients.\nUsing functional MRI and dynamic causal modeling analysis, we evaluated the connectivity between the superior colliculus, the lateral geniculate nucleus and the primary visual area V1 in de novo untreated PD patients (n\u00a0=\u00a022). A subset of the PD patients (n\u00a0=\u00a08) was longitudinally assessed two times at two months and at six months after starting dopaminergic treatment. Results were compared to those of age-matched healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a022).\nOur results indicate that the superior colliculus drives cerebral activity for luminance contrast processing both in healthy controls and untreated PD patients. The same effective connectivity was observed with neuromodulatory differences in terms of neuronal dynamic interactions. Our main findings were that the modulation induced by luminance contrast changes of the superior colliculus connectivity (self-connectivity and connectivity to the lateral geniculate nucleus) was inhibited in PD patients (effect of contrast: p\u00a0=\u00a00.79 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.77 respectively). The introduction of dopaminergic medication in a subset (n\u00a0=\u00a08) of the PD patients failed to restore the effective connectivity modulation observed in the healthy controls.\nThe deficits in luminance contrast processing in PD was associated with a deficiency in connectivity adjustment from the superior colliculus to the lateral geniculate nucleus and to V1. No differences in cerebral blood flow were observed between controls and PD patients suggesting that the deficiency was at the neuronal level. Administration of a dopaminergic treatment over six months was not able to normalize the observed alterations in inter-regional coupling. These findings highlight the presence of early dysfunctions in primary visual areas, which might be used as early markers of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Little is known on the potential relationship between osteoarthritis and Parkinson's disease.\nTherefore, the objective of this retrospective cohort study was to analyze the association between osteoarthritis and the incidence of Parkinson's disease in patients followed up for up to 10\u00a0years in general practices in the United Kingdom.\nThis study included patients diagnosed for the first time with osteoarthritis in one of 256 general practices in the United Kingdom between 2000 and 2016 (index date). Patients without osteoarthritis were matched (1:1) to those with osteoarthritis using propensity scores based on sex, age and index year. In individuals without osteoarthritis, index date corresponded to a randomly selected visit date. The outcome of this study was the 10-year cumulative incidence of Parkinson's disease in patients with and without osteoarthritis. Cox regression analyses were adjusted for common comorbidities.\nThis study included 260,224 patients (62.0% women; mean [SD] age 66.4 [12.7] years). The 10-year cumulative incidence of Parkinson's disease was 1.2% in patients with osteoarthritis and 0.6% in their counterparts without osteoarthritis (log-rank p-value\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The adjusted Cox regression model further showed a positive and significant association between osteoarthritis and the incidence of Parkinson's disease (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.82, 95% CI: 1.63-2.02). Similar results were obtained in all sex and age subgroups.\nIn this retrospective cohort study conducted in the United Kingdom, there was a positive association between osteoarthritis and the incidence of Parkinson's disease. More research is warranted to confirm or refute these findings in other settings and countries.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder featuring both motor and nonmotor symptoms associated with a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Oxidative stress (OS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. Genetic and environmental factors can produce OS, which has been implicated as a core contributor to the initiation and progression of PD through the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) orchestrates activation of multiple protective genes, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which protects cells from OS. Nrf2 has also been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects and modulate both mitochondrial function and biogenesis. Recently, a series of studies have reported that different bioactive compounds were shown to be able to activate Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE) and can ameliorate PD-associated neurotoxin, both in animal models and in tissue culture. In this review, we briefly overview the sources of OS and the association between OS and the pathogenesis of PD. Then, we provided a concise overview of Nrf2/ARE pathway and delineated the role played by activation of Nrf2/HO-1 in PD. At last, we expand our discussion to the neuroprotective effects of pharmacological modulation of Nrf2/HO-1 by bioactive compounds and the potential application of Nrf2 activators for the treatment of PD. This review suggests that pharmacological modulation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway by bioactive compounds is a therapeutic target of PD.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disturbance is one of the common symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). The study of sleep disturbance used to concentrate on treated PD. This study aimed to investigate the factors that are associated with the sleep quality of drug-na\u00efve patients with PD.\nAll participants were interviewed using a standard questionnaire to collect basic information. PD severity, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, sleep quality, cognitive status, life quality, and the presence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and minor hallucination were assessed using corresponding rating scales. The patients with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score \u22646 fell into the poor sleep group, and those with REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire score \u22655 were considered to have probable RBD.\nSeventy drug-naive patients with PD and 30 healthy controls matched for age, sex, and education were recruited. Up to 41.4% of the patients suffered from sleep disturbance, and 24.3% of the patients had RBD. Poor sleepers were more likely to have left-side predominant motor symptoms. Compared with good sleepers, poor sleepers, particularly female patients, had more burden in the aspect of anxiety and depression. RBD was associated with more nonmotor symptoms, poor sleep quality, bad performance in cognition orientation domain, anxiety, depression, presence of minor hallucination, and poor life quality.\nSleep disturbances are common in drug-na\u00efve PD and require wide attention. Motor symptom laterality and gender difference in mood are associated with sleep quality. Depression, anxiety, and RBD are highly related to sleep disturbance. RBD has many comorbidities, which can influence the cognitive function and life quality of the patients.",

    "abstract": "Inequalities in mental healthcare and lack of social support during the COVID-19 pandemic have lowered quality of life and increased overall burden of disease in people with Parkinson's (PWP). Although the pandemic has brought attention to these inequalities, they are long standing and will persist unless addressed. Lack of awareness of mental health issues is a major barrier and even when recognized disparities based on race, gender, and socioeconomic factors limit access to already scarce resources. Stigma regarding mental illness is highly prevalent and is a major barrier even when adequate care exists. Limited access to mental healthcare during the pandemic and in general increases the burden on caregivers and families. Historically, initiatives to improve mental healthcare for PWP focused on interventions designed for specialty and academic centers generally located in large metropolitan areas, which has created unintended geographic disparities in access. In order to address these issues this point of view suggests a community-based wellness model to extend the reach of mental healthcare resources for PWP.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), or paralysis agitans, is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by dopaminergic deprivation in the basal ganglia because of neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Clinically, PD apparently involves both hypokinetic (e.g. akinetic rigidity) and hyperkinetic (e.g. tremor/propulsion) symptoms. The symptomatic pathogenesis, however, has remained elusive. The recent success of deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy applied to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the globus pallidus pars internus indicates that there are essential electrophysiological abnormalities in PD. Consistently, dopamine-deprived STN shows excessive burst discharges. This proves to be a central pathophysiological element causally linked to the locomotor deficits in PD, as maneuvers (such as DBS of different polarities) decreasing and increasing STN burst discharges would decrease and increase the locomotor deficits, respectively. STN bursts are not so autonomous but show a \"relay\" feature, requiring glutamatergic synaptic inputs from the motor cortex (MC) to develop. In PD,\u00a0there is an increase in overall MC activities and the corticosubthalamic input is\u00a0enhanced and contributory to excessive burst discharges in STN. The increase in MC activities may be relevant to the enhanced beta power in local field potentials (LFP) as well as the deranged motor programming at the cortical level in PD. Moreover, MC could not only drive erroneous STN bursts, but also be driven by STN discharges at specific LFP frequencies (~\u20094 to 6\u00a0Hz) to produce coherent tremulous muscle contractions. In essence, PD may be viewed as a disorder with deranged rhythms in the cortico-subcortical re-entrant loops, manifestly including STN, the major component of the oscillating core, and MC, the origin of the final common descending motor pathways. The configurations of the deranged rhythms may play a determinant role in the symptomatic pathogenesis of PD, and provide insight into the mechanism underlying normal motor control. Therapeutic brain stimulation for PD and relevant disorders should be adaptively exercised with in-depth pathophysiological considerations for each individual patient, and aim at a final normalization of cortical discharge patterns for the best ameliorating effect on the locomotor and even non-motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) among patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and its association with confounding comorbidities.\nA population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted using Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID2000). We established AMD and non-AMD cohorts from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2012 to determine the diagnosis of PD. A total of 20,848 patients were enrolled, with 10,424 AMD patients and 10,424 controls matched for age, sex, and index year at a 1:1 ratio. The follow-up period was from the index date of AMD diagnosis to the diagnosis of PD, death, withdrawal from the insurance program, or end of 2013. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed to examine the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk of PD between the AMD and non-AMD cohorts.\nAfter adjusting for potential confounders, there was a higher risk of developing PD in the AMD cohort than in the non-AMD cohort (adjusted HR\u2009=\u20091.35, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.16-1.58). A significant association could be observed in both female (aHR\u2009=\u20091.42, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.13-1.80) and male (aHR\u2009=\u20091.28, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.05-1.57) patients, aged more than 60\u2009years (60-69: aHR\u2009=\u20091.51, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.09-2.09, 70-79: aHR\u2009=\u20091.30, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.05-1.60; 80-100: aHR\u2009=\u20091.40, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.01-1.95), and with more than one comorbidity (aHR\u2009=\u20091.40, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.20-1.64). A significant association between increased risk of PD and AMD was observed among patients with comorbidities of osteoporosis (aHR\u2009=\u20091.68, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.22-2.33), diabetes (aHR\u2009=\u20091.41, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.12-1.78) and hypertension (aHR\u2009=\u20091.36, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.15-1.62) and medications of statin (aHR\u2009=\u20091.42, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.19-1.69) and calcium channel blocker (CCB) (aHR\u2009=\u20091.32, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.11-1.58). The cumulative incidence of PD was significantly higher over the 12-year follow-up period in AMD cohort (log-rank test, p\u00a0<\u20090.001).\nPatients with AMD may exhibit a higher risk of PD than those without AMD.",

    "abstract": "A growing aging population leads to a gradual increase in the number of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). This study examines how perceived health, psychological distress, and subjective well-being evolve in older adults with PD. A cross-lagged study design was employed using data from Waves 4 and 6 of the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). In total, 421 older adults diagnosed with PD at baseline (46% women; mean age 74.98\u2009 \u00b1 \u20099.05 years) were included in the study and were followed up after a four-year lag. Auto-regressive and cross-lagged associations between the measured variables were examined in reciprocal models. Individual differences in perceived health, psychological distress, and subjective well-being were relatively stable over the 4-year lag. A final reciprocal model with significant cross-lagged effects explained the underlying structure of the sample data well: \u03c72 (49) = 101.876, ",

    "abstract": "The feasibility and safety of the use of neurorehabilitation technology (SMARTfit\nUsing a cross-over study design, eight participants with mild-to-moderate idiopathic PD (including one with mild cognitive impairment) completed both training conditions (i.e., gamified DTT and STT). For each training condition, the participants attended 2-3 sessions per week over 8.8 weeks on average, with the total amount of training being equivalent to 24 1 h sessions. A washout period averaging 11.5 weeks was inserted between training conditions. STT consisted of task-oriented training involving the practice of functional tasks, whereas for gamified DTT, the same task-oriented training was implemented simultaneously with varied cognitive games using an interactive training system (SMARTfit\nGamified DTT was feasible and safe for this cohort. Across participants, significant improvements were achieved in more outcome measures after gamified DTT than they were after STT. Individually, participants with specific demographic and clinical characteristics responded differently to the two training conditions.\nPhysical therapists' utilization of technology with versatile hardware configurations and customizable software application selections was feasible and safe for implementing a tailor-made intervention and for adapting it in real-time to meet the individualized, evolving training needs of IWPD. Specifically in comparison to optimized STT, there was a preliminary signal of efficacy for gamified DTT in improving motor and cognitive function as well as perceived disability in IWPD.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) have an increased risk for falls and near falls. They have particular difficulties with maintaining balance against an external perturbation, and several retropulsion tests exist. The Unified PD Rating Scale item 30 (UPDRS30) is the most common, involving an expected shoulder pull. Others recommend using an unexpected shoulder pull, e.g., the Nutt Retropulsion Test (NRT). We aimed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of these tests for detecting future fallers. By using two different golden standards related to self-reported prospective falls and near falls over 6 months following two different time points with 3.5 years between, we estimated sensitivity/specificity, Youden index, predictive values, and likelihood ratios for each test. The different time points yielded a different prevalence of falls and near falls, as well as different predictive values. When comparing the performance of the NRT and UPDRS30 for detecting future fallers, we found that the NRT consistently performed better than UPDRS30. However, neither test exhibited optimal performance in terms of predictive values and associated likelihood ratios. Our findings speak against using either of these tests as a single assessment for this purpose and support previous recommendations of using a multifactorial approach when targeting balance problems in PwPD.",

    "abstract": "The role that oxygen desaturation plays in exercise tolerance and its rehabilitative implications in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are unclear. We aimed to test exercise tolerance and oxygen saturation levels both during exercise and at night in PD patients to better define their rehabilitative needs. In clinically stable PD patients, undergoing inpatient rehabilitation, and in \"ON\" phase, we prospectively assessed clinical data, sleepiness, comorbidities, PD severity (Hoehn&Yahr, HY), motor function (ADLs, UPDRSII and UPDRSIII, Barthel Index, Functional Independence Measure), balance, spirometry, respiratory muscles (MIP/MEP), peak cough expiratory flow (PCEF), continuous night oxygen monitoring, and meters at 6MWT. Of 55 patients analyzed (28 with moderate-severe PD, HY \u2265 2.5), 37% and 23% showed moderate-severe impairment on UPDRSII and UPDRSIII, respectively; 96% had reduced exercise tolerance and severe respiratory muscles impairment (MIP/MEP < 45% pred.); 21.8% showed desaturations during exercise; and 12.7% showed nocturnal desaturations. At multiple regression, low exercise tolerance and low mean nocturnal and exercise-induced saturation correlated with several respiratory and motor function and disability indices (all ",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests a role for circadian dysregulation in prompting disease-related phenotypes in mammals. Cancer and neurodegenerative disorders are two aging related diseases reported to be associated with circadian disruption. In this study, we investigated a possible effect of circadian disruption in Parkinson's disease (PD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). We used high-throughput data sets retrieved from whole blood of idiopathic PD (IPD) patients and time course data sets derived from an in vitro model of CRC including the wildtype and three core-clock knockout (KO) cell lines. Several gene expression alterations in IPD patients resembled the expression profiles in the core-clock KO cells. These include expression changes in ",

    "abstract": "Immunosenescence is a process of remodeling the immune system under the influence of chronic inflammation during aging. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common age-associated neurodegenerative disorder and is frequently accompanied by neuroinflammation. On the other hand, cytomegalovirus (CMV), one of the most spread infections in humans, may induce chronic inflammation which contributes to immunosenescence, differentiation and the inflation of T cells and NK cells. Currently, there is no clear understanding of immunosenescence severity in PD patients infected with CMV. In this study, we analyzed differentiation stages and immunosenescence characteristics of T cells and NK cells in 31 patients with mild and moderate PD severity, 33 age-matched and 30 young healthy donors. The PD patients were 100% CMV-seropositive compared to 76% age-matched and 73% young CMV-infected healthy donors. The proportion of effector memory T cells re-expressing CD45RA, CD57",

The presented study aimed to compare gastrointestinal microbiota composition between patients diagnosed with PD and treated only with Levodopa to healthy controls. In this prospective study, patients were recruited in 1 academic hospital from July 2019 to July 2020. The detailed demographic data and medical history were collected using a set of questionnaires. Fecal samples were obtained from all participants. Next-Generation Sequencing was used to assess the microbiota composition. The endpoint was the difference in composition of the gut microbiota. In this study, we enrolled 27 hospitalized PD patients with well-controlled symptoms. The control group included 44 healthy subjects matched for age. Among PD patients, our results presented a higher abundance of ",

    "abstract": "In an industrial society, the proportion of geriatric people increases with rising age. These people are likely to use polypharmacy and experience medical emergencies. However, their emergency care can be complicated by unclear comorbidities and medication. The aim of this prospective interventional study was to assess the demand for a drug safety tool in clinical practice and to analyze whether the emergency box can improve acute care in a geriatric cohort. Therefore, emergency room (ER) doctors in a German tertiary hospital recorded the number of geriatric patients lacking medical information and its impact on diagnostics/treatment. Furthermore, the emergency box was distributed to patients on the neurological ward and their current drug safety concepts were assessed. After 6 months, we evaluated in a follow-up whether the tool was helpful in emergency cases. Our study revealed that 27.4% (",

    "abstract": "Motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease are characterized by unpredictability in the timing and duration of dopaminergic therapeutic benefits on symptoms, including bradykinesia and rigidity. These fluctuations significantly impair the quality of life of many Parkinson's patients. However, current clinical evaluation tools are not designed for the continuous, naturalistic (real-world) symptom monitoring needed to optimize clinical therapy to treat fluctuations. Although commercially available wearable motor monitoring, used over multiple days, can augment neurological decision making, the feasibility of rapid and dynamic detection of motor fluctuations is unclear. So far, applied wearable monitoring algorithms are trained on group data. In this study, we investigated the influence of individual model training on short timescale classification of naturalistic bradykinesia fluctuations in Parkinson's patients using a single-wrist accelerometer. As part of the Parkinson@Home study protocol, 20 Parkinson patients were recorded with bilateral wrist accelerometers for a one hour OFF medication session and a one hour ON medication session during unconstrained activities in their own homes. Kinematic metrics were extracted from the accelerometer data from the bodyside with the largest unilateral bradykinesia fluctuations across medication states. The kinematic accelerometer features were compared over the 1 h duration of recording, and medication-state classification analyses were performed on 1 min segments of data. Then, we analyzed the influence of individual versus group model training, data window length, and total number of training patients included in group model training, on classification. Statistically significant areas under the curves (AUCs) for medication induced bradykinesia fluctuation classification were seen in 85% of the Parkinson patients at the single minute timescale using the group models. Individually trained models performed at the same level as the group trained models (mean AUC both 0.70, standard deviation respectively 0.18 and 0.10) despite the small individual training dataset. AUCs of the group models improved as the length of the feature windows was increased to 300 s, and with additional training patient datasets. We were able to show that medication-induced fluctuations in bradykinesia can be classified using wrist-worn accelerometry at the time scale of a single minute. Rapid, naturalistic Parkinson motor monitoring has the clinical potential to evaluate dynamic symptomatic and therapeutic fluctuations and help tailor treatments on a fast timescale.",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects more than cognition, having a temporal relationship with neuroinflammatory pathways of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although this association is supported by epidemiological and clinical studies, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Microglia and astrocytes play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of both MDD and PD. In PD, these cells can be activated by misfolded forms of the protein \u03b1-synuclein to release cytokines that can interact with multiple different physiological processes to produce depressive symptoms, including monoamine transport and availability, the hypothalamus-pituitary axis, and neurogenesis. In MDD, glial cell activation can be induced by peripheral inflammatory agents that cross the blood-brain barrier and/or c-Fos signalling from neurons. The resulting neuroinflammation can cause neurodegeneration due to oxidative stress and glutamate excitotoxicity, contributing to PD pathology. Astrocytes are another major link due to their recognized role in the glymphatic clearance mechanism. Research suggesting that MDD causes astrocytic destruction or structural atrophy highlights the possibility that accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in the brain is facilitated as the brain cannot adequately clear the protein aggregates. This review examines research into the overlapping pathophysiology of MDD and PD with particular focus on the roles of glial cells and neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in GBA, which encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, are the highest genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), although the mechanistic link between GBA mutations and PD is unknown. An attractive hypothesis is that the lipid substrate of glucocerebrosidase, glucosylceramide, accumulates in patients with PD with a GBA mutation (PD-GBA). Despite the availability of new and accurate methods to quantitatively measure brain glucosylceramide levels, there is little evidence that glucosylceramide, or its deacetylated derivative, glucosylsphingosine, accumulates in human PD or PD-GBA brain or cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, a straightforward association between glucosylceramide levels and the development of PD does not appear valid, necessitating the involvement of other cellular pathways to explain this association, which could involve defects in lysosomal function.",

    "abstract": "Observational studies suggest that Parkinson's disease (PD) is related with the risk of cardio and cerebrovascular disease. However, the causality is not yet fully established. Therefore, we employed Mendelian randomization to assess whether PD is related to risk of ischemic stroke (IS), IS subtypes, coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI).\nEighty-eight and eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with PD at the genome-wide significance level, were used as instrumental variables for PD in European and East Asian population respectively. Using a 2-sample MR, we examined associations with IS, IS related subtypes, CAD and MI in European population. We also assessed the causal association of PD with IS and CAD in East Asian population. The primary MR analyses were performed by using the random-effects inverse variance weighted approach.\nIn European population, genetic predisposition to PD was related to higher risk of IS (odds ratio [OR], 1.03 per doubling in odds of PD; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.05; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and cardioembolic stroke (OR, 1.08 per doubling in odds of PD; 95% CI, 1.04-1.12; P\u00a0=\u00a01.29\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\nThis study found that genetic predisposition to PD is related to higher risk of IS and cardioembolic stroke in European population.",

    "abstract": "Impaired copy of intersecting pentagons from the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), has been used to assess dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD). We used a digitizing tablet during the pentagon copying test (PCT) as a potential tool for evaluating early cognitive deficits in PD without major cognitive impairment. We also aimed to uncover the neural correlates of the identified parameters using whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nWe enrolled 27 patients with PD without major cognitive impairment and 25 age-matched healthy controls (HC). We focused on drawing parameters using a digitizing tablet. Parameters with between-group differences were correlated with cognitive outcomes and were used as covariates in the whole-brain voxel-wise analysis using voxel-based morphometry; familywise error (FWE) threshold p\u00a0<\u00a00.001.\nPD patients differed from HC in attention domain z-scores (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). In terms of tablet parameters, the groups differed in Shannon entropy (horizontal in-air, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), which quantifies the movements between two strokes. In PD, a correlation was found between the median of Shannon entropy (horizontal in-air) and attention z-scores (R\u00a0=\u00a0-0.55, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). The VBM revealed an association between our drawing parameter of interest and gray matter (GM) volume variability in the right superior parietal lobe (SPL).\nUsing a digitizing tablet during the PCT, we identified a novel entropy-based parameter that differed between the nondemented PD and HC groups. This in-air parameter correlated with the level of attention and was linked to GM volume variability of the region engaged in spatial attention.",

    "abstract": "NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-induced neuroinflammation is the main pathogenic mechanism of dopaminergic (DA) neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). Hyperoside (quercetin-3-O-\u03b2-D-galactoside), an active compound obtained from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Abelmoschus manihot, is a potential inflammasome inhibitor. Besides, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activated peptide (PACAP) is an endogenous neuropeptide with neuroprotective effects in various neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD. This study aimed to explore the effects of hyperoside on inflammasome-induced neuroinflammation, and its relationship with PACAP in PD. N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was used to induce PD-like lesions in mice. Behavioral methods, including the pole test and rotarod test, were used to evaluate the hyperoside effects on MPTP-induced motor dysfunction. Immunohistochemistry was done to detect the loss of DA neurons and activation of glia in the substantia nigra compacta (SNpc). Besides, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect pro-inflammatory cytokines and Western blotting to detect the inflammasome components. PACAP 6-38, a non-irritating competitive antagonist of PACAP, was used to explore the anti-inflammation mechanism of hyperoside. The results showed that hyperoside inhibited the activation of glia and reduced the secretion of inflammatory factors, protecting DA neurons and reversing the motor dysfunction caused by MPTP. Hyperoside also inhibited the inflammasome activation by reducing the expression of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing caspases recruitment domain (ASC), and caspase-1 and increased PACAP content and CREB phosphorylation in the SNpc of the mice. PACAP 6-38 reversed the inhibitory effect of hyperoside on the microglia proliferation and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. These results indicate that hyperoside can inhibit the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by up-regulating PACAP, thus effectively inhibiting MPTP-induced neuroinflammation and protecting DA neurons. Therefore, hyperoside can be used to treat PD.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of genetic risk on whole brain white matter (WM) integrity in patients with Parkinson disease (PD).\nData were acquired from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. Polygenic load was estimated by calculating weighted polygenic risk scores (PRS) using (i) all available 26 PD-risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (PRS1) and (ii) 23 SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) >\u00a00.05 (PRS2). According to the PRS2, and combined with clinical and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data over 3-year follow-up, 60 PD patients were screened and assigned to the low-PRS group (n\u00a0=\u00a030) and high-PRS group (n\u00a0=\u00a030) to investigate intergroup differences in clinical profiles and WM microstructure measured by DTI cross-sectionally and longitudinally.\nPRS were associated with younger age at onset in patients with PD (PRS1, Spearman \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0-0.190, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003; PRS2, Spearman \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0-0.189, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). The high-PRS group showed more extensive WM microstructural degeneration compared with the low-PRS group, mainly involving the anterior thalamic radiation (AThR) and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furthermore, WM microstructural changes in AThR correlated with declining cognitive function (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.401, p\u00a0=\u00a00.028) and increasing dopaminergic deficits in caudate (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.405, p\u00a0=\u00a00.030).\nThese findings suggest that PD-associated polygenic load aggravates the WM microstructural degeneration and these changes may lead to poor cognition with continuous dopamine depletion. This study provides advanced evidence that combined with a cumulative PRS and DTI methods may predict disease progression in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease which significantly influences the life quality of patients. The protein \u03b1-synuclein plays an important driving role in PD occurrence and development. Braak's hypothesis suggests that \u03b1-synuclein is produced in intestine, and then spreads into the central nervous system through the vagus nerve. The abnormal expression of \u03b1-synuclein has been found in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Intestinal inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis have been involved in the occurrence and development of PD. The present review aimed to summarize recent advancements in studies focusing on intestinal inflammation and PD, especially the mechanisms through which link intestinal inflammation and PD. The intestinal dysfunctions such as constipation have been introduced as non-motor manifestations of PD. The possible linkages between IBD and PD, including genetic overlaps, inflammatory responses, intestinal permeability, and intestinal dysbiosis, are mainly discussed. Although it is not confirmed whether PD starts from intestine, intestinal dysfunction may affect intestinal microenvironment to influence central nervous system, including the \u03b1-synuclein pathologies and systematic inflammation. It is expected to develop some new strategies in the diagnosis and treatment of PD from the aspect of intestine. It may also become an exciting direction to find better ways to regulate the composition of gut microorganism to treat PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) in the substantia nigra (SN) and the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons. Some studies have reported that the pathology of PD originates from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which also serves as an energy portal, and develops upward along the neural pathway to the central nervous system (CNS), including the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus (DMV), SN, and hypothalamus, which are also involved in energy metabolism control. Therefore, we discuss the alterations of nuclei that regulate energy metabolism in the development of PD. In addition, due to their anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic and antioxidative roles, metabolism-related peptides are involved in the progression of PD. Furthermore, abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism are common in PD patients and exacerbate the pathological changes in PD. Therefore, in this review, we attempt to explain the correlation between PD and energy metabolism, which may provide possible strategies for PD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Apathy is thought to be an important clinical feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, its prevalence ranges greatly across studies because of differing definitions, assessment tools, and patient inclusion criteria. Furthermore, it remains unclear how the presentation of apathy in PD is related to mood disorder and/or cognitive impairment. This study sought to examine the prevalence of a pure apathy syndrome in PD, distinct from both depression and anxiety, and reveal its associated cognitive profile. A retrospective study was performed on 177 PD patients who had completed measures of apathy [Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES)] and mood functioning [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)] and had undergone extensive neuropsychological assessment, using measures of intellectual functioning, memory, executive function, attention, language, visual processing, and cognitive speed; 14.7% of the sample indicated clinically significant levels of apathy, but this nearly always co-presented with depression and/or anxiety, with cases of \"pure\" apathy very rare (2.8%). On extensive cognitive assessment, patients with mood disorder performed worse on a measure of non-verbal intellectual functioning, but patients with additional apathy or apathy only demonstrated no further losses. The syndrome of apathy in PD greatly overlaps with that of depression and anxiety, suggesting that apathy in PD may be in large an epiphenomenon of mood disorder, with no specific neuropsychological features.",

    "abstract": "Identification of Parkinson's disease subtypes may help understand underlying disease mechanisms and provide personalized management. Although clustering methods have been previously used for subtyping, they have reported generic subtypes of limited relevance in real life practice because patients do not always fit into a single category. The aim of this study was to identify new subtypes assuming that patients could be grouped differently according to certain sets of related symptoms. To this purpose, a novel model-based multi-partition clustering method was applied on data from an international, multi-center, cross-sectional study of 402 Parkinson's disease patients. Both motor and non-motor symptoms were considered. As a result, eight sets of related symptoms were identified. Each of them provided a different way to group patients: impulse control issues, overall non-motor symptoms, presence of dyskinesias and pyschosis, fatigue, axial symptoms and motor fluctuations, autonomic dysfunction, depression, and excessive sweating. Each of these groups could be seen as a subtype of the disease. Significant differences between subtypes (P< 0.01) were found in sex, age, age of onset, disease duration, Hoehn & Yahr stage, and treatment. Independent confirmation of these results could have implications for the clinical management of Parkinson's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, besides Alzheimer's Disease, characterized by multiple symptoms, including the well-known motor dysfunctions. It is well-established that there are differences in the fecal microbiota composition between Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and control populations, but the mechanisms underlying these differences are not yet fully understood. To begin to close the gap between description and mechanism we studied the relationship between the microbiota and PD in a model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. First, fecal transfers were performed with a D. melanogaster model of PD that had a mutation in the parkin (park",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is a pre-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that appears years prior to diagnosis and can affect quality of life in PD. Changes in microbiota community in deep nasal cavity near the olfactory bulb may trigger the olfactory bulb-mediated neuroinflammatory cascade and eventual dopamine loss in PD. To determine if the deep nasal cavity microbiota of PD is significantly altered in comparison to healthy controls, we characterized the microbiota of the deep nasal cavity using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in PD subjects and compared it to that of spousal and non-spousal healthy controls. Correlations between microbial taxa and PD symptom severity were also explored. Olfactory microbial communities of PD individuals were more similar to those of their spousal controls than to non-household controls. In direct comparison of PD and spousal controls and of PD and non-spousal controls, significantly differently abundant taxa were identified, and this included increased relative abundance of putative opportunistic-pathobiont species such as Moraxella catarrhalis. M. catarrhalis was also significantly correlated with more severe motor scores in PD subjects. This proof-of-concept study provides evidence that potential pathobionts are detected in the olfactory bulb and that a subset of changes in the PD microbiota community could be a consequence of unique environmental factors associated with PD living. We hypothesize that an altered deep nasal microbiota, characterized by a putative pro-inflammatory microbial community, could trigger neuroinflammation in PD.",

    "abstract": "Impulse-control disorders are commonly observed during dopamine-replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease, but the majority of patients seems \"immune\" to this side effect. Epidemiological evidence suggests that a major risk factor may be a specific difference in the layout of the dopaminergic-reinforcement system, of which the ventral striatum is a central player. A series of imaging studies of the dopaminergic system point toward a presynaptic reduction of dopamine-reuptake transporter density and dopamine synthesis capacity. Here, we review current evidence for a vulnerability-stress model in which a relative reduction of dopaminergic projections to the ventral striatum and concomitant sensitization of postsynaptic neurons represent a predisposing (hypodopaminergic) vulnerability. Stress (hyperdopaminergic) is delivered when dopamine replacement therapy leads to a relative overdosing of the already-sensitized ventral striatum. These alterations are consistent with consecutive changes in reinforcement mechanisms, which stimulate learning from reward and impede learning from punishment, thereby fostering the development of impulse-control disorders. This vulnerability-stress model might also provide important insights into the development of addictions in the non-Parkinsonian population.",

    "abstract": "Identifying modifiable risk factors for cognitive impairment in the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) and estimating their impact on cognitive status may help prevent dementia (PDD) and the design of cognitive trials.\nUsing a standard approach for the assessment of global cognition in PD and controlling for the effects of age, education and disease duration, we explored the associations between cognitive status, comorbidities, metabolic variables and lifestyle variables in 533 PD participants from the COPPADIS study.\nAmong the overall sample, 21% of participants were classified as PD-MCI (n\u2009=\u2009114) and 4% as PDD (n\u2009=\u200926). The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia was significantly higher in cognitively impaired patients while no between-group differences were found for smoking, alcohol intake or use of supplementary vitamins. Better cognitive scores were significantly associated with regular physical exercise (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and cognitive stimulation (<\u20090.01). Cognitive performance was negatively associated with interleukin 2 (Il2) (p\u2009<\u20090.05), Il6 (p\u2009<\u20090.05), iron (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and homocysteine (p\u2009<\u20090.005) levels, and positively associated with vitamin B12 levels (p\u2009<\u20090.005).\nWe extend previous findings regarding the positive and negative influence of various comorbidities and lifestyle factors on cognitive status in early PD patients, and reinforce the need to identify and treat potentially modifiable variables with the intention of exploring the possible improvement of the global cognitive status of patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is common in middle-aged and elderly people, and its onset is related to multiple factors, such as heredity, environment, and age. The vesicle protein sorting 35 (VPS35) gene was found to be a late-onset autosomal dominant familial PD (PARK17) causative gene. The protein encoded by this gene is located in the endosome and aggregates with other membrane proteins to form a retromer complex, which participates in the membrane protein cycle between the endosome and the Golgi network. Increasing evidence shows that VPS35 may participate in the pathogenesis of PD by affecting autophagy, mitochondria, neurosynaptic transmission, dopamine signaling pathways, and so forth, and it can interact with other disease-causing genes of familial PD. This article aimed to review the functions of VPS35 and the mechanism of its mutations in PD that have been discovered in recent years.",

    "abstract": "Slow-wave sleep (SWS) modulation in rodent models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease alters extracellular amyloid burden. In Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), SWS appears to be closely linked with disease symptoms and progression. PD is characterized by damaging intracellular \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) deposition that propagates extracellularly, contributing to disease spread. Intracellular \u03b1Syn is sensitive to degradation, whereas extracellular \u03b1Syn may be eliminated by glymphatic clearance, a process increased during SWS. Here, we explored whether long-term slow-wave modulation in murine models of PD presenting \u03b1Syn aggregation alters pathological protein burden and, thus, might constitute a valuable therapeutic target. Sleep-modulating treatments showed that enhancing slow waves in both VMAT2-deficient and A53T mouse models of PD reduced pathological \u03b1Syn accumulation compared to control animals. Nonpharmacological sleep deprivation had the opposite effect in VMAT2-deficient mice, severely increasing the pathological burden. We also found that SWS enhancement was associated with increased recruitment of aquaporin-4 to perivascular sites, suggesting a possible increase of glymphatic function. Furthermore, mass spectrometry data revealed differential and specific up-regulation of functional protein clusters linked to proteostasis upon slow wave\u2013enhancing interventions. Overall, the beneficial effect of SWS enhancement on neuropathological outcome in murine synucleinopathy models mirrors findings in models of Alzheimer. Modulating SWS might constitute an effective strategy for modulating PD pathology in patients.",

    "abstract": "The beneficial effects of drugs that act via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on Parkinson's disease (PD) symptomatology may explain the negative correlation between cigarette smoking and risk of this neurological condition. Varenicline, an \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR partial agonist approved for smoking cessation treatments, could be valuable for PD treatment. Here, we investigated varenicline effects in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) PD mouse model. From postnatal day (PN) 90 to PN119, male C57BL/6 mice were exposed daily to varenicline (2 mg/kg) by gavage. After that, MPTP was injected (30 mg/kg, ip) once a day for five days. At PN125, locomotor and anxiety-like effects were assessed with the open field test. At PN126, immobile behavior was assessed with the forced swimming test. At PN127, the frontal cerebral cortex was collected to evaluate dopamine and DOPAC levels. To verify whether varenicline was protective during the MPTP insult, a separate group of MPTP animals received varenicline from PN90 to PN124. MPTP reduced cortical dopamine content and increased dopamine turnover. Those effects were not reversed by varenicline treatment. Interestingly, varenicline reversed the MPTP-induced hyperactivity in the open field. Both maintenance of varenicline treatment during MPTP exposure or its interruption before MPTP exposure elicited similar results. No alterations were observed in anxiety-like behavior or in immobility time. Altogether, these findings suggested that varenicline treatment reduced the MPTP-induced hyperactivity, but did not protect against dopaminergic damage. Based on this partial protective effect, varenicline could exert neuroprotective effects on circuits that control motor activity in PD.",

The Bland-Altman plot showed no systematic changes in the mean test-retest scores. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.98 (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.93-0.99), and all individual items showed good levels of reliability (>0.60). The SEM (SEM%) and MDC (MDC%) values were 3.0 (6.75%) and 8.2 (18.7%), respectively.

    "abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein is a central player in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology. Various point mutations in \u03b1-synuclein have been identified to alter the protein-phospholipid binding behavior and cause PD. Therefore, exploration of \u03b1-synuclein-phospholipid interaction is important for understanding the PD pathogenesis and helping the early diagnosis of PD. Herein, a phospholipid-decorated liquid crystal (LC)-aqueous interface is constructed to investigate the binding between \u03b1-synucleins (wild-type and six familial mutant A30P, E46K, H50Q, G51D, A53E and A53T) and phospholipid. The application of deep learning analyzes and reveals distinct LC signatures generated by the binding of \u03b1-synuclein and phospholipid. This system allows for the identification of single point mutant \u03b1-synucleins with an average accuracy of 98.3\u00b11.3% in a fast and efficient manner. We propose that this analytical methodology provides a new platform to understand \u03b1-synuclein-lipid interactions, and can be potentially developed for easy identification of \u03b1-synuclein mutations in common clinic.",

These features include movement-related cortical potentials (0.05-5 Hz) and brain oscillations (1-50 Hz).

    "abstract": "In the last\u00a0decade, metagenomic studies have shown the key role of the gut microbiome in maintaining immune and neuroendocrine systems. Malfunction of the gut microbiome can induce inflammatory processes, oxidative stress, and cytokine storm. Dysfunction of the gut microbiome can be caused by short-term (virus infection and other infectious diseases) or long-term (environment, nutrition, and stress) factors. Here, we reviewed the inflammation and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases and coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Here, we reviewed the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) involved in the processes of formation of oxidative stress and inflammation in viral and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the coronavirus uses ACE2 receptors of the RAAS to penetrate human cells. The coronavirus infection can be the trigger for neurodegenerative diseases by dysfunction of the RAAS. Pharmabiotics, postbiotics, and next-generation probiotics, are considered as a means to prevent oxidative stress, inflammatory processes, neurodegenerative and viral diseases through gut microbiome regulation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by rigidity, akinesia, postural instability and tremor. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) reduces tremor but the effects on postural instability are inconsistent. Another component of postural control is the postural strategy, traditionally referred to as the ankle or hip strategy, which is determined by the coupling between the joint motions of the body. We aimed to determine whether DBS STN and vision (eyes open vs. eyes closed) affect the postural strategy in PD in quiet stance or during balance perturbations. Linear motion was recorded from the knee, hip, shoulder and head in 10 patients with idiopathic PD with DBS STN (after withdrawal of other anti-PD medication), 25 younger adult controls and 17 older adult controls. Correlation analyses were performed on anterior-posterior linear motion data to determine the coupling between the four positions measured. All participants were asked to stand for a 30\u00a0s period of quiet stance and a 200\u00a0s period of calf vibration. The 200\u00a0s vibration period was subdivided into four 50\u00a0s periods to study adaptation between the first vibration period (30-80\u00a0s) and the last vibration period (180-230\u00a0s). Movement was recorded in patients with PD with DBS ON and DBS OFF, and all participants were investigated with eyes closed and eyes open. DBS settings were randomized and double-blindly programmed. Patients with PD had greater coupling of the body compared to old and young controls during balance perturbations (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.046). Controls adopted a strategy with greater flexibility, particularly using the knee as a point of pivot, whereas patients with PD adopted an ankle strategy, i.e., they used the ankle as the point of pivot. There was higher flexibility in patients with PD with DBS ON and eyes open compared to DBS OFF and eyes closed (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.011). During balance perturbations, controls quickly adopted a new strategy that they retained throughout the test, but patients with PD were slower to adapt. Patients with PD further increased the coupling between segmental movement during balance perturbations with DBS ON but retained a high level of coupling with DBS OFF throughout balance perturbations. The ankle strategy during balance perturbations in patients with PD was most evident with DBS OFF and eyes closed. The increased coupling with balance perturbations implies a mechanism to reduce complexity at a cost of exerting more energy. Strategic alterations of posture were altered by DBS in patients with PD and were delayed. Our findings therefore show that DBS does not fully compensate for disease-related effects on posture.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder caused by progressive degeneration of the midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Despite intense research efforts over the past decades, the etiology of PD remains largely unknown. Here, we discovered the involvement of trophoblast glycoprotein (Tpbg) in the development of PD-like phenotypes in mice. Tpbg expression was detected in the ventral midbrain during embryonic development and in mDA neurons in adulthood. Genetic ablation of Tpbg resulted in mild degeneration of mDA neurons in aged mice (12-14 months) with behavioral deficits reminiscent of PD symptoms. Through in silico analysis, we predicted potential TPBG-interacting partners whose functions were relevant to PD pathogenesis; this result was substantiated by transcriptomic analysis of the SNc of aged Tpbg knockout mice. These findings suggest that Tpbg is a new candidate gene associated with PD and provide a new insight into PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, but its nutritional problems have not received enough attention. This study aims to identify the prevalence and associated factors of malnutrition in PD patients using two simple nutritional tools.\nWe conducted a large-scale cross-sectional study with 1478 PD patients and equal healthy controls (HC). The controlling nutritional status score (CONUT) and geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) were used for malnutrition stratification.\nBy CONUT or GNRI, the prevalence of malnutrition in PD patients was higher than that in HC (40.7% vs. 25.3% and 11.1% vs. 2.1%, respectively). The binary logistic regression model showed that malnutrition in PD was associated with male sex (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.600, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), older age (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.015, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003), lower body mass index (BMI) (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.942, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), higher levodopa equivalent daily doses (LEDD) (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.001, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), worse motor symptoms (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.012, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), more serious perceptual problems/hallucinations (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.067, P\u00a0=\u00a00.019) by CONUT. In comparison, older age (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.045, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), lower blood lymphocyte count (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.607, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006), lower serum total cholesterol levels (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.991, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), dyskinesia (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.231, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002), worse motor symptoms (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.016, P\u00a0=\u00a00.015), more severe depression (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.028, P\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and perceptual problems/hallucinations (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.061, P\u00a0=\u00a00.033) were associated with malnutrition in PD by GNRI.\nOur study indicated that malnutrition is more prevalent in PD patients than HC. Multidimensional risk factors for malnutrition in PD should be taken seriously.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease affecting the elderly, but there is no blood test for PD diagnosis in the clinic currently. This study aimed to explore promising biomarkers in platelets (PLTs) for PD diagnosis.\nPLTs were isolated from whole blood samples of PD patients and healthy controls (HCs), and RNA was extracted for sequencing. RNA-seq was performed on the Illumina HiSeq platform.\nA total of 2,221 genes with differential transcript levels (GDTLs) were identified between PD patients and HCs, 1,041 of which are upregulated genes and 1,180 of which are downregulated genes. WASH5P was the most upregulated gene and AC114491.1 was the most downregulated gene. Among the top 12 most relevant genes, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (EEF1A1), and cathepsin S (CTSS) were reported to be associated with PD. Furthermore, gene ontology analysis showed that the most significant term in biological processes was neutrophil degranulation; the most enriched term in cellular components was cytoplasmic vesicle lumen; and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily binding was the most significant term in molecular functions. In the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis, inflammation-related pathway accounts for the majority.\nOur findings demonstrated WASH5P, MALAT1, EEF1A1, and CTSS may be promising biomarkers in PD, which may contribute to improving the effectiveness and accuracy of diagnosis for PD in the future.",

Homozygous and compound heterozygous VPS13C mutations are etiologically associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, recent studies linked biallelic VPS13C mutations with the development of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Neuropathological studies on two mutated subjects showed diffuse Lewy body disease. In this article, we report the clinical and genetic findings of two subjects affected by early-onset PD carrying three novel VPS13C mutations (i.e., one homozygous and one compound heterozygous), and review the previous literature on the genetic and clinical findings of VPS13C-mutated patients, contributing to the knowledge of this rare genetic alpha-synucleinopathy.",

    "abstract": "The cardiovascular risk in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains uncertain and controversial. Some studies suggest PD patients present an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease. We aimed to study the prevalence of neuroimaging cerebrovascular biomarkers in PD patients compared to controls, using an accurate and complete magnetic resonance (MR) imaging evaluation.\nNeuroimaging sub-study within a larger cross-sectional case-control study. An enriched subgroup of PD patients (\u226410 years since diagnosis) with at least a moderate cardiovascular mortality risk based on a Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) was compared to community-based controls regarding neuroimaging biomarkers. Patients underwent a high-resolution T1-weighted MR imaging sequence at 3.0\u00a0T to visualize neuromelanin. A 3D SWI FFE, sagittal 3D T1-weighted, axial FLAIR and diffusion-weighted image sequences were obtained.\nThe study included 47 patients, 24 with PD and 23 controls. PD patients presented a reduced area and signal intensity of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus on neuromelanin-sensitive MR. The median SCORE was 5% in both groups. No significant differences regarding white matter hyperintensities (OR 4.84, 95% CI 0.50, 47.06), lacunes (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.07, 2.63), microbleeds (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.13, 3.26), or infarcts (0.95, 95% CI 0.12, 7.41) was found. The frequency of these neuroimaging biomarkers was very low in both groups.\nThe present study does not support an increased prevalence of neuroimaging cerebrovascular biomarkers in PD patients.",

PD patients presented a reduced area and signal intensity of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus on neuromelanin-sensitive MR. The median SCORE was 5% in both groups. No significant differences regarding white matter hyperintensities (OR 4.84, 95% CI 0.50, 47.06), lacunes (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.07, 2.63), microbleeds (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.13, 3.26), or infarcts (0.95, 95% CI 0.12, 7.41) was found.

    "abstract": "Although there is growing literature supporting the implementation of backward walking as a potential rehabilitation tool, moving backwards may precipitate falls for persons with Parkinson's disease. We sought to better understand interlimb coordination during backward walking in comparison to forward walking in persons with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls.\nWe assessed coordination using point estimate of relative phase at each participant's preferred walking speed.\nPersons with Parkinson's disease demonstrated impaired interlimb coordination between the more affected arm and each leg compared to controls, which worsened during backward walking.\nFor those with Parkinson's disease, inability to output smooth coordinated movement of the more affected shoulder may impair coordination during forward and, especially, backward walking. Our findings provide new information about backward walking that can allow clinicians to make safer, more effective therapeutic recommendations for persons with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have elucidated the genetic components of Parkinson's Disease (PD). However, because the vast majority of GWAS association signals fall within non-coding regions, translating these results into an interpretable, mechanistic understanding of the disease etiology remains a major challenge in the field. In this review, we provide an overview of the approaches to prioritize putative causal variants and genes as well as summarise the primary findings of previous studies. We then discuss recent efforts to integrate multi-omics data to identify likely pathogenic cell types and biological pathways implicated in PD pathogenesis. We have compiled full summary statistics of cell-type, tissue, and phentoype enrichment analyses from multiple studies of PD GWAS and provided them in a standardized format as a resource for the research community (https://github.com/RajLabMSSM/PD_omics_review). Finally, we discuss the experimental, computational, and conceptual advances that will be necessary to fully elucidate the effects of functional variants and genes on cellular dysregulation and disease risk.",

    "abstract": "The main objective of this work was to review literature on compounds extracted from olive tree leaves, such as simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol) and flavonoids (Apigenin, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, luteolin.) and their diverse pharmacological activities as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-viral, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. In addition, the study discussed the key mechanisms underlying their neuroprotective effects. This study adopted an approach of collecting data through the databases provided by ScienceDirect, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar. This review revealed that there was an agreement on the great impact of olive tree leaves phenolic compounds on many metabolic syndromes as well as on the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson. These findings would be of great importance for the use of olive tree leaves extracts as a food supplement and/or a source of drugs for many diseases. In addition, this review would of great help to beginning researchers in the field since it would offer them a general overview of the studies undertaken in the last two decades on the topic.",

The general approaches for the treatment have some side effects, but probiotics are live or attenuated microorganisms attributed to ameliorating constipation effects. Moreover, as treatments are generally well tolerated and side effects are scarce, there is room for further research. Therefore this work aims at investigating the clinical effectiveness and safety of probiotics for constipation in PD.\nPublished RCTs will be retrieved by searching Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, Wan Fang database, and China Biology Medicine Database (complete bowel movement), which will be searched from establishment of the database to October 10, 2021. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines are used to design this protocol. RevMan V.5.3 software will be used for meta-analysis, risk of bias will be assessed by the Cochrane Collaboration tool and the collected evidence will be narratively synthesized. We will also perform a meta-analysis to pool estimates from studies considered to be homogenous. Subgroup analyses will be based on intervention or overall bias.\nThe meta-analysis will assess the effectiveness and safety of using probiotics to treat and heal the constipation of PD.\nEthics approval is unrequired.\nCRD42021276215.",

    "abstract": "Pramipexole (P) or levodopa (L) treatment has been suggested as a therapeutic method for Parkinson disease (PD) in many clinical studies. Nonetheless, the combined effects of 2 drugs for PD patients are not completely understood.The aim of this research was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of P plus L (P+L) combination therapy in the treatment of PD compared to that of L monotherapy, in order to confer a reference for clinical practice.\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) of P+L for PD published up to April, 2020 were retrieved. Standardized mean difference (SMD), odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated and heterogeneity was measured with the I2 test. Sensitivity analysis was also carried out. The outcomes of interest were as follows: the efficacy, unified Parkinson disease rating scale (UPDRS) scores, Hamilton depression rating scale score or adverse events.\nTwenty-four RCTs with 2171 participants were included. Clinical efficacy of P+L combination therapy was significantly better than L monotherapy (9 trials; OR 4.29, 95% CI 2.78 to 6.64, P\u200a<\u200a.00001). Compared with L monotherapy, the pooled effects of P+L combination therapy on UPDRS score were (22 trials; SMD -1.31, 95% CI -1.57 to -1.04, P\u200a<\u200a.00001) for motor UPDRS score, (16 trials; SMD -1.26, 95% CI -1.49 to -1.03, P\u200a<\u200a.00001) for activities of daily living UPDRS score, (12 trials; SMD -1.02, 95% CI -1.27 to -0.77, P\u200a<\u200a.00001) for mental UPDRS score, (10 trials; SMD -1.54, 95% CI -1.93 to -1.15, P\u200a<\u200a.00001) for complication UPDRS score. The Hamilton depression rating scale score showed significant decrease in the P+L combination therapy compared to L monotherapy (12 trials; SMD -1.56, 95% CI -1.90 to -1.22, P\u200a<\u200a.00001). In contrast to L monotherapy, P+L combination therapy reduced the number of any adverse events obviously in PD patients (16 trials; OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.50, P\u200a<\u200a.00001).\nP+L combination therapy is superior to L monotherapy for improvement of clinical symptoms in PD patients. Moreover, the safety profile of P+L combination therapy is better than that of L monotherapy. Further well-designed, multicenter RCTs needed to identify these findings.",

    "abstract": "Although housing accessibility is associated with important health outcomes in other populations, few studies have addressed this in a Parkinson's disease population.\nTo determine the most severe environmental barriers in terms of housing accessibility problems and how these evolved over 3\u2009years among people with Parkinson's disease.\n138 participants were included (men = 67%; mean age = 68\u2009years). The most severe environmental barrier were identified by the Housing Enabler instrument and ranked in descending order. The paired t-test was used to analyse changes in accessibility problems over time.\nThe top 10 barriers remained largely unchanged over 3\u2009years, but with notable changes in order and magnitude. 'No grab bar in hygiene area' and 'Stairs only route' were top-ranked in generating accessibility problems at baseline but decreased significantly (\nThe new knowledge about how accessibility problems evolve over time could be used by occupational therapists to recommend more effective housing adaptations taking the progressive nature of Parkinson's disease into account. On societal level, the results could be used to address accessibility problems systematically.",

    "abstract": "Recently, an important role in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) is assigned to the gastrointestinal tract and the enteral nervous system. In particular, the pathological process of PD begins in the gastrointestinal tract decades before progressing to the central nervous system. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a two-way connecting system between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The pathogenesis of PD can be caused or aggravated by changes in the gastrointestinal microbiota composition. It is shown that patients with PD have changes in the intestinal microbiota. A better understanding of gut-brain interactions and the role of the gut microbiota in regulation the immune response can both bring new knowledge about the pathological progression of PD, and contribute to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.\n\u0412 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0432\u0430\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 (\u0411\u041f) \u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u043a\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0443 \u0438 \u044d\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0435. \u0412 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f \u0411\u041f \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u043a\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043d\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0443 (\u0426\u041d\u0421). \u041e\u0441\u044c \u00ab\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0430\u2014\u043a\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u2014\u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u00bb \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u0432\u0443\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u0426\u041d\u0421 \u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u043a\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u043c. \u041f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0437 \u0411\u041f \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u0432\u044b\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0443\u0441\u0443\u0433\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0435 \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u043a\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e\u0442\u044b. \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0443 \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0411\u041f \u0438\u043c\u0435\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e\u0442\u044b. \u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0433\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0437\u0430\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u2014\u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433 \u0438 \u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e\u0442\u044b \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0411\u041f, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0438\u0430\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0432\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432.",

Difficulties moving the limbs, coordination and maintaining the horizontal position during swimming appear to be the main problems that prevent normal swimming. Further studies are needed to assess the frequency of swimming disorders in PD and the mechanisms of their development. Patients with PD must be educated about the potential risk of drowning and the need to evaluate and carefully monitor their swimming skills before going into deep water.\n\u0420\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044b \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044b\u0435 \u0436\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c\u044e \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 (\u0411\u041f) \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043a \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e. \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0443\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0434\u044b \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043f\u044f\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u043d\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e. \u041d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u044b \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0442\u044b \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0411\u041f \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f. \u041d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0411\u041f \u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u0443\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u044b\u043a\u0438, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0433\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u043a\u0443\u044e \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0443.",

    "abstract": "Thermoregulatory dysfunction is considered to be the least investigated among all the autonomic disorders in Parkinson disease. Pathophysiological mechanisms of this phenomena involve as central, as peripheric parts of nervous system. Dopamine deficiency in combination with peripheric autonomic dysfunction leads to temperature balance disturbance, which may be expressed by various clinical symptoms. Dopaminergic innervation of preoptic-anterior hypothalamus area plays a crucial role in thermoregulation function of central nervous system. Current thermoregulatory tests give possibility not only to reveal sudomotor and heat dissipation disorders in patients with Parkinson disease, but also to make differential diagnosis with other neurodegenerative disorders. Early detection and treatment of thermoregulatory dysfunction may improve quality of life in patients with Parkinson disease.\n\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445

    "abstract": "To study clinical features of vestibular disorders in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to develop methods of their treatment.\nThe study included 90 patients with PD who were divided into two groups: the main group (60 patients with PD and vestibular symptoms (VS)) and the control group (30 patients with PD without VS). All patients underwent clinical neurological examination, assessment of cognitive functions, affective and autonomic disorders as well as neurovestibular examination.\nIn some cases, dizziness was due to concomitant diseases of the vestibular system. Among the rest of the patients of the main group, signs of disorders of the central mechanisms of gaze control, otolith dysfunction, anxiety disorder and visuospatial dysfunction were recorded significantly more often than in the control group. The addition of vestibular rehabilitation to the complex treatment of patients of the main group helped to reduce postural instability and decreased the risk of falls.\nVestibular disorders are significantly more common in patients with PD who complain of dizziness. An early detection of these disorders is feasible with the help of neurovestibular research. It is reasonable to add individually selected vestibular exercises to the complex treatment of these disorders.\n\u0418\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435

Among the rest of the patients of the main group, signs of disorders of the central mechanisms of gaze control, otolith dysfunction, anxiety disorder and visuospatial dysfunction were recorded significantly more often than in the control group. The addition of vestibular rehabilitation to the complex treatment of patients of the main group helped to reduce postural instability and decreased the risk of falls.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms. More than two hundred years have passed since its description, but we still discover its new manifestations. Abnormal behaviors include impulse control disorders, dopamine dysregulation syndrome, psychotic disorders and others. However, two new phenomena have been recently described in patients with PD. It can manifest in the form of doing inappropriate actions which patient doesn't recognize, or pronouncing/writing unsuitable words and phrases. Patients can't remember such episodes, but find \u00absigns\u00bb of their unconscious activity or hear about it from attestors. This article represents a review of literature on unrelated communication interlude and automatic behavior in Parkinson's disease and discusses its possible reasons.\n\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f

    "abstract": "A novel coronavirus reportedly called 2019-nCoV started to spread around the world at the end of 2019. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was later renamed after links with SARS were observed. Multiple studies have reported possible connections between the COVID-19 virus and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease. Theories support that vitamin D deficiency plays a part in the pathogenicity of Parkinson's disease or the credibility of the associated dopamine system. Administration of vitamin D3 was shown to significantly enhance the motor and non-motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease and enhance the quality of life. Also, multiple recent reviews have shown specific ways in which vitamin D reduces the risk of pathogenic infections. Recent studies supported the potential role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infections and mortality. On the immunological level, immune response regulation remains one of the well-recognized actions of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to complications in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Parkinson's disease. Whereas more studies are required, Vitamin D supplementation with a moderate and well-calculated dosage of vitamin D3 in patients with Parkinson's disease can help minimize the risk and burden of COVID-19 complications.",

    "abstract": "Objective Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a neurological condition characterized by emotional lability and a discrepancy between the patient's emotional expression and emotional experience. These uncontrollable episodes cause distress in social situations resulting in embarrassment and social withdrawal. The most comprehensive study to date estimated that 26% of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients screened positive for PBA symptoms via the validated Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) screening tool. We hypothesize that the prevalence of this disabling syndrome is higher than reported, often being labeled as depression. Methods One hundred patients were enrolled in the study and screened with a CNS-LS tool, all of whom were diagnosed with PD by a fellowship-trained movement disorder specialist. Patients were also asked about previous diagnosis of depression, current antidepressant medication use, and history of PBA diagnosis and treatment. Results The percentage of PD patients (n = 100) with PBA symptoms as defined by a CNS-LS score \u226513 was 41% (n = 41) and by a CNS-LS score \u226517 was 21.0% (n = 21). In our sample, 38.0% of patients (n = 38) had a previous clinical diagnosis of depression and 25.0% (n = 25) were currently undergoing treatment for their depression. There was a significant association between previous depression diagnosis, current antidepressant use, and higher CNS-LS scores (p < 0.001). Conclusion Using either of the CNS-LS score cutoffs, a significant proportion of the PD population in our sample displayed symptoms of PBA. We also found an association between previous diagnosis of depression and higher CNS-LS scores as well as between antidepressant use and higher CNS-LS scores. This suggests both a higher prevalence than prior studies showed as well as frequent misdiagnosis or co-diagnosis with depression.",

In this study, we evaluated the serial progression of autonomic dysfunctions between different subtypes of a prospective PD cohort.\nFrom the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, 325 PD patients (age: 61.2\u2009\u00b1\u20099.7, M\u2009:\u2009F\u2009=\u2009215\u2009:\u2009110) were enrolled. Patients were subgrouped into tremor-dominant (TD), indeterminate, and postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) subtypes. The progression of autonomic dysfunctions and dopaminergic denervation from I-123 FP-CIT SPECT images of each group were analyzed and compared at baseline, 12 months, 24 months, and 48 months of follow-up periods.\nThe SCOPA-AUT score of the indeterminate subtype was significantly higher than that of the TD subtype (\nAutonomic dysfunctions were most severe in the indeterminate subtype throughout the 48 months of the follow-up period, with a significant correlation with dopaminergic denervation.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 1-2% of the population aged 65 and over. Additionally, non-motor symptoms such as pain and gastrointestinal dysregulation are also common in PD. These impairments might stem from a dysregulation within the gut-brain axis that alters immunity and the inflammatory state and subsequently drives neurodegeneration. There is increasing evidence linking gut dysbiosis to the severity of PD's motor symptoms as well as to somatosensory hypersensitivities. Altogether, these interdependent features highlight the urgency of reviewing the links between the onset of PD's non-motor symptoms and gut immunity and whether such interplays drive the progression of PD. This review will shed light on maladaptive neuro-immune crosstalk in the context of gut dysbiosis and will posit that such deleterious interplays lead to PD-induced pain hypersensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Enhanced neuronal synchronization of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is commonly found in PD patients and corresponds to decreased motor ability. Coordinated reset (CR) was developed to decouple synchronized states causing long lasting desynchronization of neural networks. Vibrotactile CR stimulation (vCR) was developed as non-invasive therapeutic that delivers gentle vibrations to the fingertips. A previous study has shown that vCR can desynchronize abnormal brain rhythms within the sensorimotor cortex of PD patients, corresponding to sustained motor relief after 3 months of daily treatment. To further develop vCR, we created a protocol that has two phases. Study 1, a double blinded randomized sham-controlled study, is designed to address motor and non-motor symptoms, sensorimotor integration, and potential calibration methods. Study 2 examines dosing effects of vCR using a remote study design. In Study 1, we will perform a 7-month double-blind sham-controlled study including 30 PD patients randomly placed into an active vCR or inactive (sham) vCR condition. Patients will receive stimulation for 4 h a day in 2-h blocks for 6 months followed by a 1-month pause in stimulation to assess long lasting effects. Our primary outcome measure is the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III off medication after 6 months of treatment. Secondary measures include a freezing of gait (FOG) questionnaire, objective motor evaluations, sensorimotor electroencephalography (EEG) results, a vibratory temporal discrimination task (VTDT), non-motor symptom evaluations/tests such as sleep, smell, speech, quality of life measurements and Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD). Patients will be evaluated at baseline, 3, 6, and 7 months. In the second, unblinded study phase (Study 2), all patients will be given the option to receive active vCR stimulation at a reduced dose for an additional 6 months remotely. The remote MDS-UPDRS part III off medication will be our primary outcome measure. Secondary measures include sleep, quality of life, objective motor evaluations, FOG and LEDD. Patients will be evaluated in the same time periods as the first study. Results from this study will provide clinical efficacy of vCR and help validate our investigational vibrotactile device for the purpose of obtaining FDA clearance. ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the prevalent neurodegenerative diseases associated with preferential loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra compacta (SNc) and accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in DA neurons. Even though the precise pathogenesis of PD is not clear, a large number of studies have shown that microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a vital role in the process of PD development. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are widely expressed in microglia and several of them act as regulators of microglial activation upon corresponding ligands stimulations. Upon \u03b1-synuclein insults, microglia would become excessively activated through some innate immune receptors. Presently, as lack of ideal drugs for treating PD, certain GPCR which is highly expressed in microglia of PD brain and mediates neuroinflammation effectively could be a prospective source for PD therapeutic intervention. Here, six kinds of GPCRs and two types of innate immune receptors were introduced, containing adenosine receptors, purinergic receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors, adrenergic receptors, cannabinoid receptors, and melatonin receptors and their roles in neuroinflammation; we highlighted the relationship between these six GPCRs and microglial activation in PD. Based on the existing findings, we tried to expound the implication of microglial GPCRs-regulated neuroinflammation to the pathophysiology of PD and their potential to become a new expectation for clinical therapeutics.",
