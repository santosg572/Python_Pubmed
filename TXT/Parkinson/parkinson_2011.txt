    "abstract": "We herein report the case of a 67-year-old Japanese man diagnosed with sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) at 52 years of age who presented with oculogyric crisis (OGC) in the off period. Ordinarily, OGC is caused by postencephalitic parkinsonism or the chronic use of antidopaminergic medications. The OGC began at 65 years of age and was associated with the wearing-off of symptoms. The dominant OGC feature was tonic deviations in eye posture induced by looking upward with prominent retrocollis. The administration of control dopaminergic medications led to improvements in the wearing-off phenomenon and OGC. This observation confirms that sporadic PD can induce OGC in the off period.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease is a prevalent progressive neurodegenerative disorder, especially in western countries and among the elderly. This study aimed at evaluating serum iron and ferritin in patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease. In this case-control study, 50 patients with clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson disease (case group) were evaluated during a 12 month period. Fifty healthy persons (control group) recruited as well. Serum iron and ferritin levels were measured by biochemical and quantitative luminance methods, respectively in the case and control group. Fifty patients, 28 males and 22 females with the mean age of 64.53 +/- 10.18 (40-84) years and 50 controls were enrolled. Serum iron levels were 70.22 +/- 25.18 mg dL(-1) and 67.62 +/- 39.53 mg dL(-1) in case and control group, respectively. Serum ferritin levels were 129.79 +/- 137.67 ng dL(-1) and 109.87 +/- 154.71 ng dL(-1) in case and control group, respectively. There was no significant difference between different grades of Parkinson disease considering the serum level of iron or ferritin. The current study showed that generally there is no significant difference between the patients with the idiopathic Parkinson disease and healthy controls in terms of serum iron and ferritin levels. The same results were attributable to different grades of the disease.",

    "abstract": "We have shown that buspirone, a partial agonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptors, improves motor dysfunctions induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and haloperidol in rats. The present work extends these findings by investigating the role of 5-HT1A receptors on catalepsy-like immobilization in rats, a model of Parkinson's disease. Catalepsy was induced by unilateral infusion of 6-OH-dopamine (8 \u03bcg/2\u03bcL/rat) into the central region of the substantia nigra, compact part (SNc) and assayed by bar-test method 5, 60, 120 and 180 min after the drugs administration. The involvement of 5-HT1A receptors in 6-OHDA-induced catalepsy was studied through intraperitoneal (0.25, 0.5 and 1mg/Kg IP) and intrasubstantia nigra, compact part (10 \u03bcg/rat, intra-SNc) injection of 8-hydroxy-2-[di-n-propylamino] tetralin (8-OHDPAT) as well as administration of 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-pthalimmido) butyl] piperazine hydrobromide (0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/Kg, NAN-190, IP). NAN-190 (1 mg/Kg, IP) and 8-OHDPAT (1 mg/Kg, IP and 10 \u03bcg/rat, intra-SNc) increased and decreased 6-OHDA-induced catalepsy respectively. In normal (non 6-OHDA-lesioned) rats, NAN-190 (1 mg/Kg, IP) increased the elapsed time in bar-test while 8-OHDPAT did not produce any significant effect. The anticataleptic effect of 8-OHDPAT (1 mg/Kg, IP) was reversed markedly by co-injection with NAN-190 (1 mg/Kg, IP). These findings suggest that 5-HT1A receptors are involved in 6-OHDA-induced catalepsy-like immobilization.",

    "abstract": "This study describes the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of Australians living with Parkinson disease (PD) and compares the findings to international reports.\nThe Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) was used to measure HRQOL in 210 individuals with PD living in Australia. In parallel, a tailored literature search identified previous studies on HROQL in people with PD. A quantitative meta-analysis with a random-effects model was used to compare the HRQOL of individuals with PD living in Australia and other countries.\nThe mean PDQ-39 summary index (SI) score for this sample of Australians with PD was 20.9 (SD 12.7). Ratings for the dimension of social support and stigma were significantly lower than ratings for bodily discomfort, mobility, activities of daily living, cognition, and emotional well-being. Comparing the Australian and international PD samples revealed a significant heterogeneity in overall HRQOL (I(2)=97%). The mean PDQ-39 SI scores for Australians were lower, indicating better HRQOL relative to samples from other countries.\nThis Australian sample with PD perceived their HRQOL as poor, although it was less severely compromised than that of international samples. While further research is required, these findings can inform the clinical decision-making processes of physiotherapists.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade we have witnessed substantial progress towards the understanding of Parkinson's disease. According to pathological and neuroimaging studies, the traditional view of Parkinson's disease that begins with the development of motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, has begun to change. It is now understood that there would be a \"premotor\" or \"preclinical\" period in which the alphasynuclein pathology begins outside of the substantia nigra in the lower brainstem and autonomic nervous system. Although the pathophysiology of this phase is still unclear, it is currently thought that its symptoms would correspond to the so-called \"non-motor symptoms\". Hyposmia, depression, constipation and REM sleep disorders are one of the most relevant non-motor symptoms at this \"premotor\" stage. The spectrum of non-motor symptoms is very broad and covers the domains of neuropsychiatric, dysautonomic, gastrointestinal and sensory symptoms as well as sleep disorders. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, impulse control disorder, psychosis and dementia, are a major cause of disability as they are directly related to quality of life.",

    "abstract": "High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is an extremely sensitive systemic marker of inflammation and tissue damage, and increased levels of hs-CRP are strongly associated with inflammatory reactions. Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation has been hypothesized to play an important role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the clinical value of the hs-CRP level in patients with PD is poorly defined. Therefore, we conducted this study to analyze the differences in the hs-CRP levels in PD patients with and without dementia.\nWe examined 72 PD patients without dementia (PDwoD) and 45 PD patients with dementia (PDD), as well as 84 control subjects. We investigated the differences in the hs-CRP and fibrinogen levels between these three groups.\nThe mean hs-CRP and fibrinogen values were not significantly different between the PDwoD and PDD groups; however, these two groups had significantly higher mean hs-CRP and fibrinogen values than the control group.\nIt is known that inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of PD and dementia. However, based on the results of this study, we cautiously speculate that although neuroinflammation plays a role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD and dementia, it may be unrelated to the pathogenesis of dementia in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "While Drs Wolff, Parkinson, and White fully described the syndrome in 1930, prior case reports had described the essentials. Over the ensuing century this syndrome has captivated the interest of anatomists, clinical cardiologists, and cardiac surgeons. Stanley Kent described lateral muscular connections over the atrioventricular (AV) groove which he felt were the normal AV connections. The normal AV connections were, however, clearly described by His and Tawara. True right-sided AV connections were initially described by Wood et al., while \u00d6hnell first described left free wall pathways. David Scherf is thought to be the first to describe our current understanding of the pathogenesis of the WPW syndrome in terms of a re-entrant circuit involving both the AV node-His axis as well as the accessory pathway. This hypothesis was not universally accepted, and many theories were applied to explain the clinical findings. The basics of our understanding were established by the brilliant work of Pick, Langendorf, and Katz who by using careful deductive analysis of ECGs were able to define the basic pathophysiological processes. Subsequently, Wellens and Durrer applied invasive electrical stimulation to the heart in order to confirm the pathophysiological processes. Sealy and his colleagues at Duke University Medical Center were the first to successfully surgically divide an accessory pathway and ushered in the modern era of therapy for these patients. Morady and Scheinman were the first to successfully ablate an accessory pathway (posteroseptal) using high-energy direct-current shocks. Subsequently Jackman, Kuck, Morady, and a number of groups proved the remarkable safety and efficiency of catheter ablation for pathways in all locations using radiofrequency energy. More recently, Gollob et al. first described the gene responsible for a familial form of WPW. The current ability to cure patients with WPW is due to the splendid contributions of individuals from diverse disciplines throughout the world.",

    "abstract": "Impulse control disorders (ICD) (most commonly pathologic gambling, hypersexuality, and uncontrollable spending) and compulsive behaviors can be triggered by dopaminergic therapies in Parkinson disease (PD). ICD are especially prevalent in patients receiving a dopamine agonist as part of their treatment regimen for PD, and have also been reported when dopamine agonists are used for other indications (e.g., restless legs syndrome). Although these iatrogenic disorders are common, affecting 1 in 7 patients with PD on dopamine agonists, they often elude detection by the treating physician. ICD lead to serious consequences, causing significant financial loss and psychosocial morbidity for many patients and families. ICD can appear at any time during treatment with dopamine agonists, sometimes within the first few months, but most often after years of treatment, particularly when patients receive dopamine agonists and levodopa together. In most cases ICD resolve if the dopamine agonist is withdrawn, and PD motor symptoms are managed with levodopa monotherapy. Familiarity with the clinical aspects, risk factors, pathophysiology, and management of ICD is essential for physicians using dopaminergic therapies to treat PD and other disorders.",

    "abstract": "Given that impulse control disorders (ICDs) have been identified among a considerable minority of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, these conditions have gained increased clinical and research attention in the past decade. Dopamine-replacement therapies, taken to ameliorate PD symptoms, have been associated with ICDs in PD. Unfortunately, there are relatively sparse empirical data regarding how best to address ICDs in PD patients. Conversely, progress has been made in understanding the clinical, neurobiological and cognitive correlates of ICDs in PD. Some of these findings may inform possible courses of action for care providers working with PD patients with ICDs. The literature on ICDs in non-PD populations may also be informative in this regard. The goals of the present article are to outline important clinical characteristics of ICDs in PD, briefly review relevant neurocognitive and neurobiological studies and discuss possible ways to prevent and manage ICDs in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease leading to movement disorders, and is characterized neuropathologically by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, intracellular \u03b1-synuclein deposition and the formation of Lewy bodies. The difficulty of making a definitive diagnosis of PD itself, as opposed to other neurodegenerative diseases associated with parkinsonism, is a central issue in clinical PD research. However, recent advances in diagnostic methods, encompassing imaging techniques, genetic testing and measurement of biological markers may permit earlier diagnosis, and thus potentially improved management of PD.\nIn addition to clinical symptoms and imaging techniques, a number of genetic and biological markers obtained from body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluids may hold promise for the early detection of PD. It is often difficult to make an accurate diagnosis and to distinguish PD from other diseases with features of parkinsonism, particularly during the early stages of the disease. In this regard, biomarkers which are specific for PD, in combination with observation of clinical symptoms, may facilitate the early diagnosis and improved management of PD.\nGood biomarkers for PD could be helpful for early diagnosis, management and tracking of disease progression. Furthermore, combined analysis using several kinds of biomarkers may allow the detection of preclinical PD, which in turn may facilitate a prevention of disease onset with the use of disease-modifying drugs.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder predominantly characterized by motor symptoms including bradykinesia and resting tremor. The gold standard of treatment for PD remains dopamine replacement therapy, which eventually fails due to continued progression of the disease and the development of debilitating side effects. Recent breakthroughs are providing the first major advances in the development of fundamentally new pharmacological strategies for the treatment of PD that do not rely on dopamine replacement strategies, but rather aim to reduce the overactive indirect pathway within the basal ganglia. In this article, we will review the role of metabotropic glutamate receptors within the basal ganglia and discuss the potential for modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors as a treatment for PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease whose pathogenesis involves a number of genes and environmental factors. The FGF20 gene encoding the fibroblast growth factor and paying an important role neuron proliferation and survival is one of candidate genes of PD. There is evidence that this gene is also involved in the control of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) gene expression. The rs12720208 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the FGF20 gene has been found to be associated with PD; it has been located to the 3'-UTR binding site for microRNA-433, which is involved in the control of FGF20 expression. Therefore, the frequency distribution of rs12720208 genotypes in the FGF20 gene has been analyzed in a sample of patients with sporadic PD and a control sample of the Russian population. The results have not shown any effect of rs12720208 in the FGF20 gene on the risk of PD in patients residing in Russia (OR = 0.95, the 95% confidence interval (CI) is 0.55-1.63, p = 0.9).",

    "abstract": "Most cases of idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD) are believed to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between toxocariasis and Parkinson disease (PD). Patients were selected from people who were admitted to the Movement Disorders Branch, Neurology Department of Elaz\u0131\u011f University Faculty of Medicine Elaz\u0131\u011f, Turkey. We studied specific IgG antibodies against Toxocara canis (T. canis) in 50 patients with idiopathic Parkinson and 50 healthy volunteers. We investigated the clinical history of three patients infected with T. canis. We also studied specific IgG antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii in these groups. Antibodies anti-Toxocara canis were found in 3 idiopathic PD (6%) (P = 0.121) and antibody titer was not found in control. A patient had history of the presence of dog in current dog ownership. We did not detect any statistically significant association between T. canis and IPD. But, we believe that further comprehensive studies are required for understanding whether there is a causal relation between toxocariasis and PD. We didn't find possible association between Toxoplasma gondii and IPD (P = 0.617).",

    "abstract": "One third of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have mentioned \"dysphonia\" as their most debilitating communication deficit. Patient-based measurements, such as Voice Handicap Index (VHI) add necessary supplementary information to clinical and physiological assessment. There are a few studies about relation between VHI and disease severity in PD, although none of them showed any significant correlation. The goal of this study was to find correlation between these variables in Iranian PD patients.\nThis cross-sectional, analytical and non-interventional study was done on 23 PD patients who reported a voice disorder related to their disease. They were selected from attendants of movement disorders clinic of Hazrat Rasool Akram Hospital. The relationship between disease severity (according to Hoehn and Yahr/H&Y and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-part3 /UPDRS-III) and VHI questionnaire (and its 3 domains) was investigated based on patients' sex, UPDRS-III score H&Y and VHI.\nTotal VHI and its 3 domains had no relationship with disease severity (H&Y) in all patients and by sex separation. However, there was a positive correlation between VHI and disease severity (UPDRS-III) (r = 0.485). There was also a relation between physical and functional domains of VHI and UPDRS (rP=0.530, rF=0.479) while no relationship observed regarding sex differences. 9 out of 18 UPDRS-III items had strong relationship with VHI (total and 3subscales).\nIranian PD patients feel handicap according to voice disorder caused by PD. Patient satisfaction of voice decreases with the disease severity and progression. A larger sample size is necessary to find relationship in genders. VHI is an important issue could be offered to be used in PD beside other assessments.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders are undoubtedly an increasing problem in the health sciences, given the increase of life expectancy and occasional vicious life style. Despite the fact that the mechanisms of such diseases are far from being completely understood, a large number of studies that derive from both the basic science and clinical approaches have contributed substantial data in that direction. In this review, it is discussed several frontiers of basic research on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, in which research groups from three departments of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo have been involved in a multidisciplinary effort. The main focus of the review involves the animal models that have been developed to study cellular and molecular aspects of those neurodegenerative diseases, including oxidative stress, insulin signaling and proteomic analyses, among others. We anticipate that this review will help the group determine future directions of joint research in the field and, more importantly, set the level of cooperation we plan to develop in collaboration with colleagues of the Nucleus for Applied Neuroscience Research that are mostly involved with clinical research in the same field.",

    "abstract": "The possible relationship between essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) has been controversial since the first description of PD. However, there is increasing evidence suggesting an overlap between these two disorders. The aim of this review is to examine the relationship between PD and ET, focusing on clinical, epidemiologic, genetic, neuroimaging, and neuropathological data, and the presence of cardinal parkinsonism symptoms in ET.\nWe conducted a PubMed search for articles published between 1966 and November 2011 regarding the relationship between ET and PD and the presence of postural tremor in PD patients; the presence of rest tremor, rigidity, and slowed movements in ET patients is reviewed.\nClinical series, follow-up studies of ET patients, and case-control and genetic epidemiological studies indicate that ET is associated with increased risk for PD. Some neuroimaging studies and neuropathological reports suggest an association between the two diseases. ET patients show high prevalence of rest tremor, and at least seven studies described slowed movements (possibly related to cerebellar dysfunction and/or bradykinesia) in patients with ET.\nThere is reasonable epidemiological and clinical evidence to support a link between ET and PD, although it is not clear what factors predict ET patient risk for developing PD or, more rarely, of PD patients developing ET. Future multicentric and multidisciplinary studies including epidemiological, clinical, neuroimaging, genetic, and neuropathological assessments are required to understand these associations.",

    "abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the most commonly chosen antidepressants in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of our study was to assess the influence of fluoxetine (Flu) on motor functions in patients with PD.\nIn this prospective, controlled, open-label study, 18 patients with PD and mild depression [(10 < or = Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HDRS) < or = 23)] without dementia [(25 < or = Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)] were treated with Flu. Both single and repeated dose effects of Flu were assessed on days 1-80. Plasma concentrations of Flu and norfluoxetine (NORFlu) were correlated with the results of selected motor function performance scores: The Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Score (UPDRS), Finger Tapping Test (FTT) and Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT). Severity of PD, depression and dementia were evaluated using standard tests [(Hoehn and Yahr stages (HY), activity of daily living (ADL), UPDRS, HDRS, MMSE)].\nSteady-state for Flu/NORFlu was reached after 18 days of treatment. Such a plateau correlated with significant improvements in both scores of depression and Parkinson's disability (HDRS, UPDRS and ADL, respectively). In addition, FTT and PPT scores also increased until day 18, with further slight fluctuations around the plateau. Optimal motor performances correlated with Flu concentrations of approximately 60-110 microg/L.\nFlu (20 mg/day) significantly reduced depression in PD patients while it did not impair their motor performances. Because substantial placebo effects may arise in studies of PD and depression, large, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease, the most common neurological disorder in the elderly, is characterized by progressive extrapyramidal motor dysfunction including resting tremors, muscle rigidity, hypolocomotion (bradykinesia and akinesia) and postural instability. Various non-motor features are also seen such as cognitive impairments (deficits in learning and memory) and mood disorders (depression and anxiety). While the 5-HT(1A) receptor has long been implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of anxiety and depression, recent research has revealed new therapeutic roles for 5-HT(1A) receptors in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. These include the modulation of parkinsonian motor symptoms, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia, cognitive impairments and emesis. Thus, 5-HT(1A) agonists improve the various motor disorders associated with dopaminergic deficits, dyskinesia induced by chronic L-DOPA treatment, mood disturbances (anxiety and depression) and dopamine agonist-induced emesis. In addition, partial 5-HT(1A) agonists are expected to improve cognitive impairment in Parkinson's patients. These findings encourage research into new 5-HT(1A) receptor ligands, which will improve efficacy and/or ameliorate adverse reactions in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. Because the current therapies only lead to temporary, limited improvement and have severe side effects, new approaches to treat PD need to be developed. To discover new targets for potential therapeutic intervention, a chemical genetic approach involving the use of small molecules as pharmacological tools has been implemented. First, a screening of an in-house chemical library on a well-established cellular model of PD was done followed by a detailed pharmacological analysis of the hits. Here, we report the results found for the small heterocyclic derivative called SC001, which after different enzymatic assays was revealed to be a new glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitor with IC(50) = 3.38 \u00b1 0.08 \u03bcM. To confirm that GSK-3 could be a good target for PD, the evaluation of a set of structurally diverse GSK-3 inhibitors as neuroprotective agents for PD was performed. Results show that inhibitors of GSK-3 have neuroprotective effects in vitro representing a new pharmacological option for the disease-modifying treatment of PD. Furthermore, we show that SC001 is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, protects dopaminergic neurons, and reduces microglia activation in in vivo models of Parkinson disease, being a good candidate for further drug development.",

Patients with PD sometimes have osteopenia and vertebral deformity due to the destruction of fragile bone can be also associated with the spinal deformity. Surgical treatment for these patients is very difficult. We encountered a patient with PD presenting severe trunk sagittal and frontal deformity. The patient had cauda equina syndrome due to progressive vertebral collapse of the lumbar spine. We performed anterior reconstruction surgery at first in order to achieve improved lordotic alignment of the lumbar spine. Then, we performed 2 posterior surgeries, resulting in total long fusion from T4 to S1. The clinical findings of this patient were presented, and the treatment options were discussed.",

    "abstract": "Several cases of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis induced by anti-Parkinson agents have been reported. Our previous study demonstrated that pergolide and pramipexole stimulated elevation of plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels in some patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but that levodopa/carbidopa (300/30 mg/day) did not affect plasma AVP levels in treatment-na\u00efve PD patients. On the basis of the binding profile of ropinirole to monoamine receptors, we hypothesized that ropinirole does not stimulate AVP secretion. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis.\nInclusion criteria were patients with probable PD suffering from a wearing-off phenomenon and who had been treated using levodopa/carbidopa with or without entacapone, but not with other classes of anti-Parkinson agents. Patients were excluded if they had at least one condition that could be associated with high AVP levels. Ropinirole was initiated at 0.5 mg 3 times daily, and daily dosages were increased by 1.5 mg/day on a biweekly basis up to 6 mg/day. Plasma AVP levels were determined every two weeks. Effects of escalating ropinirole dosage on plasma AVP levels were evaluated using a one-way analysis of variance for repeated measures, an a priori Dunnett multiple comparison test, and a regression analysis.\nOf 16 patients enrolled, 11 patients (four males and seven females) completed the study. There was no statistically significant dose-response relationship between the ropinirole dosage and plasma AVP levels.\nA minimal therapeutic dosage of ropinirole did not affect plasma AVP levels in patients with PD taking levodopa.",

    "abstract": "We studied 38 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) without dementia (mean age, 67.3\u00b14.8 years; 15 males, 23 females) with complaints on sleep disorders. Quality of sleep was assessed with the Parkinson's disease sleep scale (PDSS) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) as well as with overnight polysomnographic (PSG) study at baseline and at the end of the trial. The effectiveness of sleep was estimated as TST/TIB x100% (TIB - habitual time in bed, TST - habitual total sleeping time). REM latency (LREM), periodic limb movements (PLM) (total number and sleep index) were measured as well. All patients underwent neuropsychological testing using MMSE, five-word test, digit span and the Hamilton scale (HAM-D). Patients were allocated to 2 groups. Group 1 (n=20) received melatonin in addition to the previous dopaminergic treatment in dose 3 mg 30 minutes before bedtime for 6 weeks, group 2 (n=18) received clonazepam 2 mg at night (with gradual titration over 4 weeks from 0,5 mg). Compared to baseline, melatonin and clonazepam reduced sleep disorders in patients: PDSS scores from 89.9\u00b18.9 to 129.5\u00b19.4 (p=0.0001) and from 91.0\u00b18.7 to 110.1\u00b112.4 scores (p=0.03), respectively. However, the daytime sleepiness (ESS) was significantly increased (from 3.8\u00b11.2 to 7.3\u00b12.2 scores; p=0.0002) in the clonazepam group. In the melatonin group, ESS scores were 4.1\u00b11.4 before treatment and 4.7\u00b11.4 after treatment (p=0.06). Patients treated with melatonin had better scores on the MMSE (p=0.00009), five-word test (p=0.009), Hamilton scale (p=0.00009) at the end of the study period as compared with the clonazepam group. Changes in total point scores on the PSG at the end of week 6, as compared with the beginning of the trial, were in favor of the group treated with melatonin, with significant changes in the LS (p=0.004), total sleep time/time in bad (TST/TIB) (p=0,001) sections. The number of REM sleep epochs remained lower in patients treated with clonazepam (p=0.0001). The data suggest high treatment efficacy of melatonin in the treatment of sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease without dementia.",

The task was the same conditional associative learning task as that used previously in monkeys and healthy humans to unveil the striatum involvement in habit learning. Sixteen patients and 20 age- and education-matched healthy control subjects learned sets of 3 visuo-motor associations between complex patterns and joystick displacements during two testing sessions separated by a few hours. We distinguished errors preceding vs. following the first correct response to compare patients' performance during the earliest phase of learning dominated by goal-directed actions with that observed later on, when responses start to become habitual. The disease significantly retarded both learning phases, especially in patients under 60 years of age. However, only the late phase deficit was disease severity-dependent and persisted on the second testing session. These findings provide the first corroboration in Parkinson patients of two ideas well-established in the animal literature. The first is the idea that associating visual stimuli to motor acts is a form of habit learning that engages the striatum. It is confirmed here by the global impairment in visuo-motor learning induced by PD. The second idea is that goal-directed behaviors are predominantly caudate-dependent whereas habitual responses are primarily putamen-dependent. At the advanced PD stages tested here, dopamine depletion is greater in the putamen than in the caudate nucleus. Accordingly, the late phase of learning corresponding to the emergence of habitual responses was more vulnerable to the disease than the early phase dominated by goal-directed actions.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenic mechanism of Parkinson's disease (PD) appears to be multifactorial. However, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, including activation of NADPH-dependent oxidases, play a major role in the progression of dopaminergic cell death. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was described as a circulating humoral system that regulates blood pressure and water homeostasis. However, there exist local RAS in many tissues, and locally formed angiotensin activates NADPH-dependent oxidases, which are a major source of superoxide and are upregulated in major aging-related diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, an intracellular or intracrine RAS, with still unknown functions, has been identified in several cell types. The brain has an independent local RAS, which has been involved in several brain disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. It is particularly interesting for PD the important interaction observed between angiotensin and dopamine, which counterregulate each other in renal cells and also in the striatum and substantia nigra. In recent studies, we have observed both a local and an intracellular RAS in the rodent, monkey and human substantia nigra, and that dopamine depletion induced RAS upregulation possibly as a compensatory mechanism. However, RAS hyperactivation also exacerbated oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, which contributed to progression of dopaminergic degeneration. In addition, we observed increased RAS activity in the nigra of animals with higher vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to degeneration, such as aged males, menopausal females and rats subjected to chronic brain hypoperfusion. RAS activity and dopaminergic vulnerability were significantly reduced by treatment with angiotensin type I receptor antagonists. Manipulation of the brain RAS may constitute an effective neuroprotective strategy against dopaminergic degeneration in PD.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence indicates the role of exosomes in a variety of physiological pathways as conveyors of biological materials from cell-to-cell. However the molecular mechanism(s) of secretion and their interaction with receiving cells are yet unclear. Recently, it is emerging that exosomes are involved in pathological processes as potential carriers in the progression of neurodegenerative pathologies associated with misfolded proteins. In the current review we will discuss some recent findings on the key role of exosomes in the spreading of the aggregated products of \u03b1-synuclein from neuron-to-neuron and of inflammatory response propagation from immune cell-to-cell; we will highlight the implication of exosomes in the neurodegeneration and progression of the disease and the their potential interplay with genes related to Parkinson's disease. Increasing our knowledge on the cell-to-cell transmissions might provide new insights into mechanism of disease onset and progression and identify novel strategies for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention in Parkinson and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Fetal transplantation for Parkinson disease (PD) had been considered a promising therapeutic strategy; however, reports of Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) in engrafted tissue adds to controversy surrounding this treatment for PD.\nThe brain of a PD patient who had fetal transplantation 14 years before death was evaluated. The graft was studied with routine histologic methods, as well as immunohistochemistry for \u03b1-synuclein, neurofilament, synaptophysin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), as well as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for astrocytes and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA-1) for microglia.\nOn coronal sections of the brain, the graft extended from the putamen to the amygdala, abutting the anterior hippocampus. Microscopically, the graft consisted of neuron-rich and glia-rich portions. Neuron-rich portions, resembling a neuronal heterotopia, were located in the putamen, whereas the glia-rich portion was more ventral near the amygdala. LBs and LNs were detected in the ventral portion of the graft, especially that part of the graft within the amygdala. Areas with LBs and LNs also had astrogliosis and microgliosis. TH positive neurons were rare and their distribution did not overlap with LBs or LNs.\nLBs and LNs were detected in the transplanted tissue with \u03b1-synuclein immunohistochemistry. Unexpected outgrowth of the graft into the amygdala was accompanied by skewed distribution of LBs and gliosis, more abundant in the graft within the amygdala. The distribution of LBs within the graft may suggest the potential role of the local environment as well as gliosis in formation of \u03b1-synuclein pathology.",

    "abstract": "The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) is widely used to assess cognition and screen for dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD). In 2008, Llebaria and colleagues reported excellent sensitivity and specificity detecting dementia in PD using a DRS total score cutoff of 123. However, this study used a sample with rather low mean educational achievement (8.9 years). The 123 cutoff score was cross-validated in a sample of 51 PD patients with a rather high mean educational achievement (14.84 years). A total score cutoff of 123 correctly classified 60.7% of the sample, with 20% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Use of age- and education-corrected scaled scores improved classification accuracy, but these cutoffs corresponded to the 25th percentile. Optimal classification of 82.4% accuracy was achieved using a raw total score cutoff of 133, corresponding roughly to the 16th percentile. Neither age nor education evinced a strong correlation to DRS total score in our sample. Results suggest caution in applying the DRS-2 total score cutoff of 123 and highlight the importance of comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations for clinical diagnosis of dementia in PD.",

    "abstract": "Objective and rater independent analysis of movement impairment is one of the most challenging tasks in medical engineering. Especially assessment of motor symptoms defines the clinical diagnosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). A sensor-based system to measure the movement of the upper and lower extremities would therefore complement the clinical evaluation of PD. In this study two different sensor-based systems were combined to assess movement of 18 PD patients and 17 healthy controls. First, hand motor function was evaluated using a sensor pen with integrated accelerometers and pressure sensors, and second, gait function was assessed using a sports shoe with attached inertial sensors (gyroscopes,accelerometers).Subjects performed standardized tests for both extremities.Features were calculated from sensor signals to differentiate between patients and controls. For the latter, pattern recognition methods were used and the performance of four classifiers was compared. In a first step classification was done for every single system and in a second step for combined features of both systems. Combination of both motor task assessments substantially improved classification rates to 97%using the AdaBoost classifier for the experiment patients vs.controls.The combination of two different analysis systems led to enhanced, more stable, objective, and rater independent recognition of motor impairment. The method can be used as a complementary diagnostic tool for movement disorders.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait is a phenomenon common in Parkinson's patients and significantly affects quality of life. Sensory cues have been known to improve walking performance and reduce freezing of gait. Visual cues are reported to be particularly effective for this purpose. So far, sensory cues have generally been provided continuously, even when currently not needed. However, a recent approach suggests the provision of cues just in the case that freezing actually occurs. The arguments in favor of this \"on-demand\" cueing are reduced intrusiveness and reduced habituation to cues. Here, we analyzed the effect of visual cues on the number and duration of freezing episodes when activated either just \"on-demand\" or continuously and compare it to the baseline condition where no cue is provided. For this purpose, 7 Parkinson's patients regularly suffering from freezing of gait repeatedly walked a pre-defined course and their reaction to parallel laser lines projected in front of them on the floor was analyzed. The results show that, in comparison to the baseline condition, the mean duration of freezing was reduced by 51% in continuous cueing and by 69% in \"on-demand\" cueing. Concerning the number of freezing episodes, 43% fewer episodes were observed for continuous cueing and 9% less episodes for \"on-demand\" cueing.",

    "abstract": "We propose a linear discriminant regression analysis (LDRA) that provides an estimated severity marker for discriminating between healthy and patient groups and estimating severities of the patient group simultaneously. This method combines an evaluation function for discriminating between two groups and one for estimating severities of one group. The combined function is optimized to obtain an equation for calculating estimated severities. The method was evaluated with finger-tapping data of healthy and Parkinson's disease (PD) groups and PD severities assessed by a doctor. As a result, the discrimination ability of LDRA (AUC: 0.8835) was higher than that of discriminant analysis (DA. AUC: 0.8442), which is a conventional method for classification, and the regression ability of LDRA (mean square error (MSE): 1.27) was superior to that of multiple regression analysis (MRA. MSE: 1.68), which is a conventional method for regression. The results show that LDRA is an effective method for estimating the presence and severity of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we report on a new method for potential diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) based on the analysis of the spontaneous response of vestibular system recorded by Electrovestibulography (EVestG). EVestG data of 20 individuals with PD and 28 healthy controls were adopted from a previous study. The field potentials and their firing pattern in response to whole body tilt stimuli from both left and right ears were extracted. We investigated several statistical and fractal features of the field potentials and also their firing patterns. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to select the features showing the most significant differences between individuals with PD and the age-matched controls. Linear Discriminant analysis classification was applied to every selected feature using a leave-one-out routine. The result of each feature's classifier was used in a heuristic weighted average voting system to diagnose PD patients. The weights of the voting system were the (posterior) probabilities calculated by the designed classifier to indicate a subject related to a specific class. The results show more than 97% accuracy for PD diagnosis. Given that the patients were at different stage of disease, the high accuracy of the results encourages the use of vestibular response for PD diagnosis as a plausible quick and non-invasive screening tool.",

    "abstract": "In this study, polysomnographic left side EOG signals from ten control subjects, ten iRBD patients and ten Parkinson's patients were decomposed in time and frequency using wavelet transformation. A total of 28 features were computed as the means and standard deviations in energy measures from different reconstructed detail subbands across all sleep epochs during a whole night of sleep. A subset of features was chosen based on a cross validated Shrunken Centroids Regularized Discriminant Analysis, where the controls were treated as one group and the patients as another. Classification of the subjects was done by a leave-one-out validation approach using same method, and reached a sensitivity of 95%, a specificity of 70% and an accuracy of 86.7%. It was found that in the optimal subset of features, two hold lower frequencies reflecting the rapid eye movements and two hold higher frequencies reflecting EMG activity. This study demonstrates that both analysis of eye movements during sleep as well as EMG activity measured at the EOG channel hold potential of being biomarkers for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a highly promising therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, most patients do not get full therapeutic benefit from DBS, due to its critical dependence on electrode location in the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN). For this reason, we believe that the development of a novel surgical tool for DBS placement, i.e., an automated intraoperative closed-loop DBS localization system, is essential. In this paper, we analyze single unit spiking activity of 120 neurons in different STN locations collected from 4 PD patients. Specifically, for each neuron, we estimate a point process model (PPM) of the spiking activity for different depths within the STN by which we are able to detect pathological bursting and oscillations. Our results suggest that these signatures are more prominent in the dorsolateral part of the STN. Therefore, accurately placing the DBS electrode in this target may result in maximal therapeutic benefit with less power effort required by DBS. Furthermore, PPMs might be an effective tool for modeling of the STN neuronal activities as a function of location within the STN, which may pave the way towards developing a closed-loop navigation tool for optimal DBS electrode placement.",

    "abstract": "The success of stereotactic surgery for Deep Brain Stimulation depends critically on the exact positioning of a microelectrode recording in a target area of the brain. This paper presents the software system NEUROZONE composed of two main applications: first, it allows online recognition of brain structures by the analysis of signals from microelectrode recordings (MER), and second, it processes and analyses off-line databases allowing the inclusion of new trained classifiers for automatic identification. The software serves as a support to the analysis done by a medical specialist during surgery, and seeks to reduce the adverse side effects that may occur because of inadequate identification of the target areas. The software also allows the specialists to label recordings obtained during surgery, in order to generate a new off-line database or increase the amount of records in an already existing off-line database. NEUROZONE has been tested for Deep Brain Stimulation performed at the Institute for Epilepsy and Parkinson of the Eje Cafetero (Colombia), achieving positive identifications of the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) over to 85% using a naive Bayes classifier.",

Some research has shown that auxiliary cueing in the form of vision, audio, or vibration can improve the gait of PD patients. We have developed a new vibratory feedback shoe, known as the PDShoe, which builds on existing research. This device can modulate both frequency and amplitude of feedback for the wearer. It is untethered, and thus can be worn during daily activities. Pressure and tactor status data are transmitted wirelessly over a personal area network to a notebook computer. This computer can also control the tactor actuation and stimulation frequency. This paper describes the details of design and construction of the PDShoe. A preliminary evaluation with four Parkinson's disease subjects and two healthy subjects is included to show the usability of the device.",

    "abstract": "Over half of patients with PD eventually develop freezing of gait (FoG), an intermittent failure to initiate or maintain walking that is often associated with trembling of the legs. We tested 21 PD with FoG, 27 PD without FoG, and 21 healthy elderly people in a clinic with the Intrumented Timed Up and Go test (ITUG). FoG was quantified from the power spectral density of the antero-posterior shank acceleration from which a Frequency Ratio was calculated as the square of the total power in the 3-8 Hz band, divided by the square of the total power in the .5-3 Hz band. Spatiotemporal gait parameters calculated from synchronized gyroscopes on the two legs were also measured in these subjects. The Frequency Ratio was significantly larger in freezers than in non-freezers or control subjects. It better differentiated gait disorders between PD subjects with and without FoG than traditional gait measures such as stride length, stride velocity and double support time. The Frequency Ratio was validated as significantly correlated with self-perceived severity of gait and balance confidence. This Freezing Ratio will be useful to quantify FoG during a simple ITUG, a popular clinical test of mobility.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that alters the patients' motor performance. Patients suffer many motor symptoms: bradykinesia, dyskinesia and freezing of gait, among others. Furthermore, patients alternate between periods in which they are able to move smoothly for some hours (ON state), and periods with motor complications (OFF state). An accurate report of PD motor states and symptoms will enable doctors to personalize medication intake and, therefore, improve response to treatment. Additionally, real-time reporting could allow an automatic management of PD by means of an automatic control of drug-administration pump doses. Such a system must be able to provide accurate information without disturbing the patients' daily life activities. This paper presents the results of the MoMoPa study classifying motor states and dyskinesia from 20 PD patients by using a belt-worn single tri-axial accelerometer. The algorithms obtained will be validated in a further study with 15 PD patients and will be enhanced in the REMPARK project.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of Gait (FOG) is one of the most disabling gait disturbances of Parkinson's disease (PD). The experience has often been described as \"feeling like their feet have been glued to the floor while trying to walk\" and as such it is a common cause of falling in PD patients. In this paper, EEG subbands Wavelet Energy and Total Wavelet Entropy were extracted using the multiresolution decomposition of EEG signal based on the Discrete Wavelet Transform and were used to analyze the dynamics in the EEG during freezing. The Back Propagation Neural Network classifier has the ability to identify the onset of freezing of PD patients during walking using these features with average values of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are around 75 %. This results have proved the feasibility of utilized EEG in future treatment of FOG.",

Many studies have used a single external cue or 2 different cues to correct PD gait.\nAn aim of this study was to determine the influence of paired proprioceptive cues on gait parameters of individuals with PD.\nDouble-blind randomized controlled trial.\nSubjects were 30 PD patients who had mild to moderate impairment according to the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). They were randomly assigned to either a routine physiotherapy program or treadmill training with vibratory stimuli applied to the feet plantar surfaces and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) as well as the same physiotherapy program. All Participants received a 45-minutes session of low intensity physiotherapy program, 3 times a week, for 8 weeks. The duration of treadmill training was 5 minutes at baseline and 25 minutes at the end of treatment. Walking speed and distance were recorded from the treadmill control panel for both groups before and immediately after the end of treatment. The Qualysis ProReflex motion analysis system was used to measure cadence, stride length, hip, knee, and ankle joints' angular excursion.\nThe cadence, stride length, and lower limb joints' angular excursion showed a significant improvement in both groups (P \u2264 0.05). These improvements in spatio-temporal parameters and angular excursion were higher in the study group than in the control group (P \u2264 0.05).\nPotentiated proprioceptive feedback improves parkinsonian gait kinematics, the hip, knee, and ankle joints' angular excursion.",

Health Related Quality of Life (-HRQoL) comprises a wide spectrum of consequences of the disease. Measurement of quality of life has become increasingly relevant as an outcome parameter, especially in long-term trials. Most of the available QoL instruments depend on patient self-reports. The data can be collected by written questionnaires. There are universal questionnaires of QoL--for many diseases and the specific ones--specially created for one disease. Among universal questionnaires, the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) and the Short-Form Health Status Survey (SF-36) are the most popular in Parkinson's disease. As for specific questionnaires: the Parkinson`s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) and the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQL) have been described.",

    "abstract": "The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a widely applied index of disease severity. Our objective was to assess the utility of UPDRS for predicting peak aerobic capacity (VO2 peak) and ambulatory function. Participants (n = 70) underwent evaluation for UPDRS (Total and Motor ratings), VO2 peak, 6-minute walk distance (6MW), and 30-foot self-selected walking speed (SSWS). Using regression, we determined the extent to which the Total and Motor UPDRS scores predicted each functional capacity measure after adjusting for age and sex. We also tested whether adding the Hoehn and Yahr scale (H-Y) to the model changed predictive power of the UPDRS. Adjusted for age and sex, both the Total UPDRS and Motor UPDRS subscale failed to predict VO2 peak. The Total UPDRS did weakly predict 6MW and SSWS (both p < 0.05), but the Motor UPDRS subscale did not predict these ambulatory function tests. After adding H-Y to the model, Total UPDRS was no longer an independent predictor of 6MW but remained a predictor of SSWS. We conclude that Total and Motor UPDRS rating scales do not predict VO2 peak, but that a weak relationship exists between Total UPDRS and measures of ambulatory function.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies emphasize a key role of controlled operations, such as set-shifting and inhibition, in the occurrence of freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, FOG can also be characterized as a de-automatization disorder, showing impairments in both the execution and acquisition of automaticity. The observed deficits in automaticity and executive functioning indicate that both processes are malfunctioning in freezers. Therefore, to explain FOG from a cognitive-based perspective, we present a model describing the pathways involved in automatic and controlled processes prior to a FOG episode. Crucially, we focus on disturbances in automaticity and control, regulated by the frontostriatal circuitry. In complex situations, non-freezing PD patients may compensate for deficits in automaticity by switching to increased cognitive control. However, as both automatic and controlled processes are more severely impaired in freezers, this hampers cognitive compensation in FOG, resulting in a potential breakdown. Future directions for cognitive rehabilitation are proposed, based on the cognitive model we put forward.",

Such as chemical agents with neuromolecular effect among which is the MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6 tetra-hydropyridine), MPP (1-methyl-4-phenyl hypyridinium), paraquat, the latter used as a herbicide in the agricultural fields of our country. It has been documented in epidemiological and experimental studies the association of occupational exposure to paraquat and Parkinson's disease.

    "abstract": "We used tests for evaluation of latent period, duration, and accuracy of eyes, head, or hand movements and their coordinated movements. Comparative analysis of these parameters was performed in healthy subjects and in patients with early stages of Parkinson's disease. The pathology data significantly (p<0.05) differed from those in normal control subjects. These results can be used as neurophysiological markers of early neurodegenerative process. Increasing the number of tests would lead to better specificity of the markers. It will be possible to create a battery of neurophysiological tests most likely reflecting the predictive basis of early neurodegenerative process.",

    "abstract": "Gait impairments are prevalent among people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Instructions to focus on walking can improve walking in PD, but the use of such a cognitive strategy may be limited under dual-task walking conditions, when walking is performed simultaneously with concurrent cognitive or motor tasks. This study examined how dual-task performance of walking and a concurrent cognitive task was affected by instructions in people with PD compared to healthy young and older individuals. Dual-task walking and cognitive task performance was characterized under two sets of instructions as follows: (1) focus on walking and (2) focus on the cognitive task. People with PD and healthy adults walked faster when instructed to focus on walking. However, when focused on walking, people with PD and young adults demonstrated declines in the cognitive task. This suggests that dual-task performance is flexible and can be modified by instructions in people with PD, but walking improvements may come at a cost to cognitive task performance. The ability to modify dual-task performance in response to instructions or other task and environmental factors is critical to mobility in daily life. Future research should continue to examine factors that influence dual-task performance among people with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has traditionally been characterized by its cardinal motor symptoms of bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability. However, PD is increasingly being recognized as a multidimensional disease associated with myriad nonmotor symptoms including autonomic dysfunction, mood disorders, cognitive impairment, pain, gastrointestinal disturbance, impaired olfaction, psychosis, and sleep disorders. Sleep disturbances, which include sleep fragmentation, daytime somnolence, sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), nightmares, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), are estimated to occur in 60% to 98% of patients with PD. For years nonmotor symptoms received little attention from clinicians and researchers, but now these symptoms are known to be significant predictors of morbidity in determining quality of life, costs of disease, and rates of institutionalization. A discussion of the clinical aspects, pathophysiology, evaluation techniques, and treatment options for the sleep disorders that are encountered with PD is presented.",

Three weeks after surgery, rats demonstrated cognitive deficit and depressive-like behavior without definite motor impairment. Pretreatment with hemantane (10 mg/kg) and the reference drug amantadine (20 mg/kg) 5 days before MPTP and further administration during 3 weeks after MPTP preserve cognitive function and prevented depressive disturbances in rats. The antidepressive effect of hemantane was more pronounced than that of amantadine. Results obtained, together with data on hemantane mechanism of action, allow hemantane to be considered as a promising drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease with potential to decrease the rate of disease progression when administered on early stages.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD), and are the primary cause of disability in many PD patients. Our aim in this study was to translate the origin non-motor symptoms scale for PD (NMSS), which was written in English, into Korean (K-NMSS), and to evaluate its reliability and validity for use with Korean-speaking patients with PD.\nIn total, 102 patients with PD from 9 movement disorders sections of university teaching hospitals in Korea were enrolled in this study. They were assessed using the K-NMSS, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Korean version of the Mini-Mental Status Examination (K-MMSE), the Korean version of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (K-MADS), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ39). Test-retest reliability was assessed over a time interval of 10-14 days in all but one patient.\nThe K-NMSS was administered to 102 patients with PD. The internal consistency and reliability of this tool was 0.742 (mean Cronbach's \u03b1-coefficient). The test-retest correlation reliability was 0.941 (Guttman split-half coefficient). There was a moderate correlation between the total K-NMSS score and the scores for UPDRS part I [Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, (rS)=0.521, p<0.001] and UPDRS part II (rS=0.464, p=0.001), but there was only a weak correlation between the total K-NMSS score and the UPDRS part III score (rS=0.288, p=0.003). The total K-NMSS score was significantly correlated with the K-MADS (rS=0.594, p<0.001), K-MMSE (rS=-0.291, p=0.003), and ESS (rS=0.348, p<0.001). The total K-NMSS score was also significantly and positively correlated with the PDQ39 score (rS=0.814, p<0.001).\nThe K-NMSS exhibited good reliability and validity for the assessment of non-motor symptoms in Korean PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are rarely attributable to sustained or incessant tachyarrhythmias in infants and children with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. However, several recent reports suggested that significant LV dysfunction may develop in WPW syndrome in the absence of tachyarrhythmias. It is assumed that an asynchronous ventricular activation over the accessory pathway, especially right-sided, induces septal wall motion abnormalities, ventricular remodeling and ventricular dysfunction. The prognosis of DCM associated with asymptomatic WPW is excellent. Loss of ventricular pre-excitation results in mechanical resynchronization and reverse remodeling where LV function recovers completely. The reversible nature of LV dysfunction after loss of ventricular pre-excitation supports the causal relationship between LV dysfunction and ventricular pre-excitation. This review summarizes recent clinical and electrophysiological evidence for development of LV dysfunction or DCM in asymptomatic WPW syndrome, and discusses the underlying pathophysiological mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disorders are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and seem to be strongly associated with depression. It has been suggested that sleep disorders as well as depression are caused by a disturbed circadian rhythm. Indeed, PD patients are prone to misalignment of their circadian rhythm due to various factors, and many patients with PD display a phase advance of their circadian rhythm. Current treatment options for sleep disorders and depression in patients with PD are limited and can have serious side effects; alternative treatments are therefore badly needed. Bright light therapy (BLT) restores circadian rhythmicity effectively in mood- and sleep-disturbed patients without PD. The few studies that focused on the efficacy of BLT in patients with PD demonstrated a positive effect of BLT not only on sleep and mood but also on motor function. More research on the neurobiology and efficacy of BLT in PD is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder related to the loss or absence of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. These deficits result in slowness of movement, tremor, rigidity, and dysfunction of behaviour. These symptoms negatively influence the patient's capability to carry out the daily oral hygiene manoeuvres. The aim of this work is to record the oral health condition of PD patients evaluated at the IRCSS Bonino-Puleio in Messina. The oral health of 45 consecutive PD patients (study group) with neurologic diagnosis based on United Kingdom Brain Bank Criteria has been compared with that of another 45 no PD patients of the same age (control group). The evaluation of the general oral condition was recorded underlining tooth loss, active periodontal disease, and presence of untreated caries. The frequency of untreated caries, periodontal diseases, and missing teeth of the study group was significantly higher than in control group. Based on the data results, clinicians should direct high attention to the oral hygiene of patients with PD, above all at the early stages of the caries or periodontal disease, in order to prevent serious evolution of those pathologic dental conditions that may finally result in the tooth extraction event.",

    "abstract": "Genetic polymorphisms have been shown to be involved in dopaminergic neurotransmission. This may influence susceptibility to Parkinson's disease (PD). We performed a case-control study of the association between PD susceptibility and a genetic polymorphism of MAOB and COMT, both separately and in combination, in Iranians. The study enrolled 103 Iranian patients with PD and 70 healthy individuals. Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods were used for genotyping. Our data indicated that the MAOB genotype frequencies in PD patients did not differ significantly from the control group. However, the frequency of MAOB GG genotype was significantly lower in female patients. It has been shown that the distribution of MAOB allele A was slightly higher in PD patients. No statistically significant differences were found in the COMT allele and genotype distribution in PD patients in comparison to the controls. The combined haplotype of the MAOB A, A/A and COMT LL genotype showed a slight increase in the risk of PD in female patients in this Iranian population. The data may suggest that the MAOB and COMT genetic polymorphisms do not play any role in the pathogenesis of PD in Iranians. In addition, the combined haplotype of MAOB and COMT genes did not significantly affect the susceptibility to PD. Future studies involving larger control and case populations will undoubtedly lead to a more thorough understanding of the role of the polymorphisms involved in the dopamine pathway in PD.",

    "abstract": "The quality of life (QoL) of informal caregivers can be adversely affected by a number of factors. This issue, however, has not been well explored for carers of people with Parkinson's (PwP), with research largely restricted to the assessment of caregiver burden and caregiver strain. This study aims to determine the main influences on carer QoL in this population and consider results in the context of current clinical guidelines for the management of Parkinson's disease (PD). Carers completed the newly validated PDQ-Carer, and PwP completed the PDQ-39. The sample comprised 238 carers (mean age 68.20 years) and 238\u2009PwP (mean age 71.64). Results suggest multiple influences on caregiver QoL. These include carer age, gender, health status, and duration of the caregiving role. PwP levels of mobility and cognitive impairment are also significant influences on carer QoL. Not only should practitioners and service providers be particularly aware of the heightened impact of PD on carers over time and as PwP symptoms deteriorate, but this should also be reflected in clinical guidelines for the management of PD.",

    "abstract": "Small regulatory RNAs, such as miRNAs, are increasingly being recognized not only as regulators of developmental processes but contributors to pathological states. The number of miRNAs determined experimentally to be involved in Parkinson's disease (PD) development and progression is small and includes regulators of pathologic proteins, neurotrophic factors, and xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. PD gene-association studies have also indicated miRNAs in the pathology. In this review, we present known miRNAs and their validated targets that contribute to PD development and progression. We also incorporate data mining methods to link additional miRNAs with non-experimentally validated targets and propose additional roles of miRNAs in neurodegenerative processes. Furthermore, we present the potential contribution of next-generation-sequencing approaches to elucidate mechanisms and etiology of PD through discovery of novel miRNAs and other non-coding RNA classes.",

    "abstract": "Impulsive behaviours commonly manifest in treated Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and, are typically viewed as sequelae of dopaminergic therapy. However, recent evidence shows that impulsivity in those patients may not only depend on medication status. Instead, there is the suggestion that dopaminergic therapy interacts with existing neuroanatomical and/or neurochemical abnormalities, to produce impulsive behaviour in certain vulnerable patients.\nIn this study, we investigated whether grey matter atrophy in fronto-striatal brain regions contributes to inhibitory dysfunction - a key feature of impulsive behaviour - in PD. Importantly, we contrasted 25 PD patients with 11 behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients, who have well-established inhibitory dysfunction and related grey matter atrophy. We employed a questionnaire to assess impulsive behaviours (Barrett Impulsiveness Scale), and measures of verbal inhibitory function (Hayling Test) and response inhibitory function (a go/no-go task). Behavioural analyses were conducted to examine performance in the PD and bvFTD patients and in 15 healthy controls. Scores on the verbal and response inhibition tasks were also entered as covariates in a region of interest voxel-based morphometry analysis, to determine the grey matter correlates.\nPD patients showed impairments in inhibitory function, though to a milder degree than bvFTD patients. In the Parkinson's sample, frontal atrophy (namely, orbitofrontal and right inferior frontal cortex) was shown to correlate with verbal disinhibition, and striatal atrophy (right nucleus accumbens) was associated with response disinhibition, whereas a more distributed pattern of fronto-striatal atrophy was associated with the bvFTD patients' performance on inhibitory measures.\nThese results provide the first evidence that disinhibition in PD is related to fronto-striatal grey matter atrophy. Our study adds support to the hypothesis that impulsivity in PD is not solely mediated by dopaminergic medication effects, but that fronto-striatal structural abnormalities contribute to impulsive behaviours in these patients.",

    "abstract": "In advanced-stage Parkinson's disease (PD), motor fluctuation is a frequent and disabling problem. Assessment of motor fluctuation depends on patient's subjective self-statement. We examined whether the subjective fluctuation matched the objective motor fluctuation defined by gait disorders. Using a new device, the portable gait rhythmogram, we recorded gait cadence and acceleration continuously over the 24-hour period in 54 patients with PD and 17 normal controls, for the quantitative evaluation of motor fluctuation. The patients were asked to estimate motor fluctuation every hour. In 44 of 54 patients, changes in the cadence were associated with simultaneous changes in acceleration. We examined the subjective fluctuation in these 44 patients who were confirmed to have motor fluctuation. Nineteen (82.7%) of 23 patients who felt no fluctuation showed distinct gait disorders. During off time, they walked with marked short or bradykinetic stepping. No matching changes were observed in either the cadence or acceleration in 11 (52.4%) of 21 patients who perceived motor fluctuation. No synchronization was noted in 30 (68.2%) of the 44 patients, between the times of subjectively assessed motor fluctuation and those of quantitative analysis of gait disorder. This discrepancy suggests that the objective continuous recording of the cadence and acceleration is necessary to understand motor fluctuation.",

    "abstract": "[(11)C](R)PK11195-PET measures upregulation of translocator protein, which is associated with microglial activation, [(11)C]PIB-PET is a marker of amyloid, while [(18)F]FDG-PET measures cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMRGlc). We hypothesize that microglial activation is an early event in the Parkinson's disease (PD) spectrum and is independent of the amyloid pathology. The aim of this study is to evaluate in vivo the relationship between microglial activation, amyloid deposition, and glucose metabolism in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and PD subjects without dementia. Here, we evaluated 11 PDD subjects, 8 PD subjects without dementia, and 24 control subjects. Subjects underwent T1 and T2 MRI, [(11)C](R)PK11195, [(18)F]FDG, and [(11)C]PIB PET scans. Parametric maps of [(11)C](R)PK11195 binding potential, rCMRGlc, and [(11)C]PIB uptake were interrogated using region of interest and SPM (statistical parametric mapping) analysis. The PDD patients showed a significant increase of microglial activation in anterior and posterior cingulate, striatum, frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortical regions compared with the controls. The PD subjects also showed a statistically significant increase in microglial activation in temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. [(11)C]PIB uptake was marginally increased in PDD and PD. There was a significant reduction in glucose metabolism in PDD and PD. We have also demonstrated pixel-by-pixel correlation between mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score and microglial activation, and MMSE score and rCMRGlc. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that cortical microglial activation and reduced glucose metabolism can be detected early on in this disease spectrum. Significant microglial activation may be a factor in driving the disease process in PDD. Given this, agents that affect microglial activation could have an influence on disease progression.",

In the acupuncture + medication group, on the basic treatment as the above, electroacupuncture was applied to Baihui (GV 20), Yintang (EX-HN 3), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Taichong (LR 3) and Sanyinjiao (SP 6), etc. The level of the serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the score of Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) were observed and compared before treatment and after 3 months of treatment. The efficacy was assessed in two groups.\nThe level of BDFN was improved significantly after treatment as compared with that before treatment in two groups (both P < 0.05) and the result in the acupuncture + medication group was superior to the medication group (P < 0.05). HAMD scores were reduced significantly after treatment as compared with those before treatment in two groups (both P < 0.05) and the result in the acupuncture + medication group was superior to the medication group (P < 0.05).

    "abstract": "The dopamine transporter (DAT) regulates synaptic dopamine (DA) in striatum and modulation of DAT can affect locomotor activity. Thus, in Parkinson's disease (PD), DAT loss could affect DA clearance and locomotor activity. The locomotor benefits of L-DOPA may be mediated by transport through monoamine transporters and conversion to DA. However, its impact upon DA reuptake is unknown and may modulate synaptic DA. Using the unilateral 6-OHDA rat PD model, we examined [(3)H]DA uptake dynamics in relation to striatal DAT and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein loss compared with contralateral intact striatum. Despite >70% striatal DAT loss, DA uptake decreased only \u223c25% and increased as DAT loss approached 99%. As other monoamine transporters can transport DA, we determined if norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) differentially modulated DA uptake in lesioned striatum. Unlabeled DA, NE, and 5-HT were used, at a concentration that differentially inhibited DA uptake in intact striatum, to compete against [(3)H]DA uptake. In 6-OHDA lesioned striatum, DA was less effective, whereas NE was more effective, at inhibiting [(3)H]DA uptake. Furthermore, norepinephrine transporter (NET) protein levels increased and desipramine was \u223ctwo-fold more effective at inhibiting NE uptake. Serotonin inhibited [(3)H]DA uptake, but without significant difference between lesioned and contralateral striatum. L-DOPA inhibited [(3)H]DA uptake two-fold more in lesioned striatum and inhibited NE uptake \u223cfive-fold more than DA uptake in na\u00efve striatum. Consequently, DA uptake may be mediated by NET when DAT loss is at PD levels. Increased inhibition of DA uptake by L-DOPA and its preferential inhibition of NE over DA uptake, indicates that NET-mediated DA uptake may be modulated by L-DOPA when DAT loss exceeds 70%. These results indicate a novel mechanism for DA uptake during PD progression and provide new insight into how L-DOPA affects DA uptake, revealing possible mechanisms of its therapeutic and side effect potential.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) has become an accepted treatment for patients experiencing the motor complications of Parkinson's disease (PD). While its successes are becoming increasingly apparent, the mechanisms underlying its action remain unclear. Multiple studies using radiotracer-based imaging have investigated DBS-induced regional changes in neural activity. However, little is known about the effect of DBS on connectivity within neural networks; in other words, whether DBS impacts upon functional integration of specialized regions of cortex. In this work, we report the first findings of fMRI in 10 subjects with PD and fully implanted DBS hardware receiving efficacious stimulation. Despite the technical demands associated with the safe acquisition of fMRI data from patients with implanted hardware, robust activation changes were identified in the insula cortex and thalamus in response to therapeutic STN DBS. We then quantified the neuromodulatory effects of DBS and compared sixteen dynamic causal models of effective connectivity between the two identified nodes. Using Bayesian model comparison, we found unequivocal evidence for the modulation of extrinsic (between region), i.e. cortico-thalamic and thalamo-cortical connections. Using Bayesian model parameter averaging we found that during voluntary movements, DBS reversed the effective connectivity between regions of the cortex and thalamus. This casts the therapeutic effects of DBS in a fundamentally new light, emphasising a role in changing distributed cortico-subcortical interactions. We conclude that STN DBS does impact upon the effective connectivity between the cortex and thalamus by changing their sensitivities to extrinsic afferents. Furthermore, we confirm that fMRI is both feasible and is tolerated well by these patients provided strict safety measures are adhered to.",

    "abstract": "This article describes an open cross-sectional observational study involving 47 participants with Parkinson disease (PD) and 47 (age- and sex-matched) nondisabled controls without PD. The aim was to determine the profiles of subjective visual vertical (SVV) perception and sense of smell perception in both groups. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) between patients and controls on their smell test performance. Controls were more likely to correctly identify odors, with a median score of 10 out of 12 compared with 6.5 out of 12 for patients with PD. The median SVV error for the PD group when the frame was untilted was 0.75 degrees compared with 0.50 degrees for controls. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.02). When the frame was tilted, the median SVV error for the PD group was 2.31 degrees compared with 2.00 degrees for controls (not statistically significant), with both groups showing similar distribution pattern of errors. There was no statistical correlation between number of correctly identified odors and an individual's SVV error. However, a statistically significant negative correlation (r = -0.45, p = 0.01) was found between Mini-Mental State Examination score and mean time taken to complete each rod and frame test in patients with PD, suggesting that SVV errors might be more correlated with cognitive function than with loss of sense of smell.",

Here we present studies on interactions of Zn(II), Cu(II), Fe(II) ions with benserazide and with benserazide/levodopa in ternary system. By applying mass spectrometry and UV-vis methods we describe the interactions between selected metal ions and the drug additives in the investigated systems.

    "abstract": "The genetic variants in glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene have been previously examined as potential susceptibility factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). Although of great interest, possible role of GBA gene in PD has not been well investigated in eastern Chinese population. To explore this association, we conducted a genetic screen of three common GBA variants (p.L444P, p.N370S, and p.R120W) in a casecontrol cohort comprised of 638 subjects of Chinese ethnicity. In order to provide a more precise estimate of this association, a meta-analysis was performed. We found that the GBA p.L444P allele was significantly more frequent (P = 0.001) in the PD patients (6/195 = 3.08%) than in the controls (0/443). The p.L444P mutation, but not p.N370S and p.R120W, was found to be associated with PD. Combined analysis including all previously published ancestral Chinese data yielded a highly significant association between the GBA gene and an increased risk for PD (OR = 8.13, 95% CI, 4.43-14.92, P < 0.00001). Our study suggests that the GBA gene may be a susceptibility gene for PD in the Chinese population. Efforts to elucidate in detail this interesting and biologically plausible genetic association are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder caused by decay of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra (SN), which are basal ganglia residing within the midbrain area. In the past two decades, transcranial B-mode sonography (TCUS) has emerged as a viable tool in differential diagnosis of PD and recently has been shown to have promising potential as a screening technique for early detection of PD, even before onset of motor symptoms. In TCUS imaging, the degeneration of SN cells becomes visible as bright and hyper-echogenic speckle patches (SNE) in the midbrain. Recent research proposes the usage of 3D ultrasound imaging in order to make the application of the TCUS technique easier and more objective. In this work, for the first time, we propose an automatic 3D SNE detection approach based on random forests, with a novel formulation of SNE probability that relies on visual context and anatomical priors. On a 3D-TCUS dataset of 11 PD patients and 11 healthy controls, we demonstrate that our SNE detection approach yields promising results with a sensitivity and specificity of around 83%.",

However a procedure including rating scale of SN hyperechogenicity was required for a standard clinical setting with increased use. We applied the feature analysis method to a large TCS dataset that is relevant for clinical practice and includes the variability that is present under real conditions. In order to decrease the influence to the image properties from the different settings of ultrasound machine, we propose a local image analysis method using an invariant scale blob detection for the hyperechogenicity estimation. The local features are extracted from the detected blobs and the watershed regions in half of mesencephalon area. The performance of these features is evaluated by a feature-selection method. The cross validation results show that the local features could be used for PD detection.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) progresses relentlessly and affects approximately 4% of the population aged over 80 years old. It is difficult to diagnose in its early stages. The purpose of our study is to identify molecular biomarkers for PD initiation using a computational bioinformatics analysis of gene expression. We downloaded the gene expression profile of PD from Gene Expression Omnibus and identified differentially coexpressed genes (DCGs) and dysfunctional pathways in PD patients compared to controls. Besides, we built a regulatory network by mapping the DCGs to known regulatory data between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes and calculated the regulatory impact factor of each transcription factor. As the results, a total of 1004 genes associated with PD initiation were identified. Pathway enrichment of these genes suggests that biological processes of protein turnover were impaired in PD. In the regulatory network, HLF, E2F1 and STAT4 were found have altered expression levels in PD patients. The expression levels of other transcription factors, NKX3-1, TAL1, RFX1 and EGR3, were not found altered. However, they regulated differentially expressed genes. In conclusion, we suggest that HLF, E2F1 and STAT4 may be used as molecular biomarkers for PD; however, more work is needed to validate our result.",

    "abstract": "\u03b1-synuclein is thought to play a key role in Parkinson's disease (PD) because it is the major protein in Lewy bodies, and because its gene mutations, duplication, and triplication are associated with early-onset PD. There are conflicting reports as to whether serum and plasma concentrations of \u03b1-synuclein and anti-\u03b1-synuclein antibodies differ between PD and control subjects. The objectives of this study were to compare the levels of \u03b1-synuclein and its antibodies between individuals with typical PD (n=14), atypical Parkinson syndromes (n=11), idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (n=10), and healthy controls (n=9), to assess the strength of association between these serum proteins, and to determine group sizes needed for a high probability (80% power) of detecting statistical significance for 25% or 50% differences between typical PD and control subjects for these measurements. Analysis of log-transformed data found no statistically significant differences between groups for either \u03b1-synuclein or its antibodies. The concentrations of these proteins were weakly correlated (Spearman rho=0.16). In subjects with typical PD and atypical Parkinson syndromes, anti-\u03b1-synuclein antibody levels above 1.5 \u00b5g/ml were detected only in subjects with no more than four years of clinical disease. Power analysis indicated that 236 and 73 samples per group would be required for an 80% probability that 25% and 50% differences, respectively, in mean \u03b1-synuclein levels between typical PD and control subjects would be statistically significant; for anti-\u03b1-synuclein antibodies, 283 and 87 samples per group would be required. Our findings are consistent with those previous studies which suggested that serum concentrations of \u03b1-synuclein and its antibodies are not significantly altered in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a pathological condition characterized by a progressive neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons with the consequent reduction of dopamine content in the substantia nigra. The neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) is widely used to mimic the neuropathology of PD in both in vivo and in vitro experimental models. We found that, as expected, in dopaminergic human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells the toxin reduced cell viability causing programmed cell death as assessed by an increase in DNA fragmentation. We also examined, in these cells, the activation/inactivation of several pro and anti apoptotic signaling pathways by 6-OHDA including p-38 kinase (p-38), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), protein kinase B (also known as Akt), glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2), and Bcl-2 protein. Guanine-based purines, exert neuroprotective effects and we previously reported that guanosine activates cell survival pathways including PI3K/Akt/PKB signaling in different kinds of cells including glia and neuroblastoma cells. In the present study we found that guanosine (300 \u00b5M) protected SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells when they were exposed to 6-OHDA, promoting their survival. Guanosine reduced the 6-OHDA mediated activation of p-38 and JNK. Moreover the nucleoside potentiated the early increase in the phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic kinase Akt and the increase in the expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein induced by 6-OHDA. In summary our results show that guanosine results to be neuroprotective in a recognized in vitro model of PD thus suggesting that it could represent a new potential pharmacological tool to be studied in the therapeutic approach to PD.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the hypothesis that rule reconfiguration in task switching can isolate aspects of intact and impaired control at different stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) by comparing switches between concrete naming rules pertaining to stimulus selection, to switches between abstract rules which allocate categorization responses to these stimuli. Based on previous findings, it was hypothesized that attentional switches, where task set competition emerges at the stimulus but not response set level, highlights striatal dopaminergic function. Conversely, increasing the degree of task set competition to encompass reconfiguration of response set when switching between abstract rules, represents a condition which engages the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and renders this manipulation sensitive to frontal damage. To this end, we investigated task switching with concrete and abstract rules in unilaterally (Hoehn & Yahr stage I) and bilaterally (Hoehn & Yahr stage II) affected PD patients, as well as striatally intact frontal lesion patients. As predicted, frontal lesion patients demonstrated switching deficits only with abstract categorization rules, where switching engendered complete task set reconfiguration and a new response, as did stage II PD patients with presumed frontal cortical pathology. Replicating previous findings, stage I PD patients with relatively circumscribed striatal pathology demonstrated no such impairment. Disease severity also impacted on attentional switching indexed by naming rules, since medicated stage II but not stage I patients demonstrated switching deficits emerging from stimulus set reconfiguration, suggesting that the ameliorative efficacy of dopaminergic medication is inversely related to the severity of the striatal deficit. These findings illustrate that the nature of the rules that are switched, and its implication in terms of reconfiguring different task set elements, highlights different neural characters of cognitive flexibility. These manipulations may help decipher the differential effects of progressive neurodegeneration on parkinsonian cognition, and provide a framework in which to conceptualize the contributions of cortical and subcortical regions to cognitive control.",

    "abstract": "Patients with amygdala lesions were found to be impaired in recognizing the fear emotion both from face and from music. In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), impairment in recognition of emotions from facial expressions was reported for disgust, fear, sadness and anger, but no studies had yet investigated this population for the recognition of emotions from both face and music.\nThe ability to recognize basic universal emotions (fear, happiness and sadness) from both face and music was investigated in 24 medicated patients with PD and 24 healthy controls. The patient group was tested for language (verbal fluency tasks), memory (digit and spatial span), executive functions (Similarities and Picture Completion subtests of the WAIS III, Brixton and Stroop tests), visual attention (Bells test), and fulfilled self-assessment tests for anxiety and depression.\nResults showed that the PD group was significantly impaired for recognition of both fear and sadness emotions from facial expressions, whereas their performance in recognition of emotions from musical excerpts was not different from that of the control group. The scores of fear and sadness recognition from faces were neither correlated to scores in tests for executive and cognitive functions, nor to scores in self-assessment scales.\nWe attributed the observed dissociation to the modality (visual vs. auditory) of presentation and to the ecological value of the musical stimuli that we used. We discuss the relevance of our findings for the care of patients with PD.",

The aim of the study was to investigate whether the extent of STDT alterations differs between patients with parkinsonian type multiple system atrophy (MSA-P) and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Possible differences between the two groups may help to differentiate MSA-P from PD.\nSTDT was investigated in 20 patients with MSA-P, 21 patients with PD and 18 age-matched healthy subjects. The clinical evaluation included the Mini-Mental State Examination, Hoehn and Yahr Scale, Frontal Assessment Battery, Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale for patients with MSA-P, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale for patients with PD. STDT was investigated by delivering paired electrical stimuli starting with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 0 ms (simultaneous pair), and progressively increasing the ISIs in 10-ms steps.\nBetween-group anova showed that STDT statistically differed in MSA-P versus patients with PD and healthy subjects. Post hoc showed that STDT values in patients with MSA-P were significantly higher than those in patients with PD and healthy subjects. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that STDT testing yielded high diagnostic specificity and sensitivity.\nSTDT is abnormal in patients with MSA-P and PD. The degree of STDT abnormalities is higher in patients with MSA-P than in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Functional neurosurgical techniques provide a unique opportunity to explore patterns of interaction between the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous work using simultaneous magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and local field potential (LFP) recordings from the region of the subthalamic nucleus (STNr) has characterised resting patterns of connectivity in the alpha and beta frequency bands and their modulation by dopaminergic medication. Recently we have also characterised the effect of movement on patterns of gamma band coherence between the STNr and cortical sites. Here we specifically investigate how the prominent coherence between the STNr and temporal cortex in the alpha band is modulated by movement both on and off dopaminergic medication in patients following the insertion of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) electrodes. We show that movement is associated with a suppression of local alpha power in the temporal cortex and STNr that begins about 2s prior to a self-paced movement and is independent of dopaminergic status. In contrast, the peak reduction in coherence between these sites occurs after movement onset and is more marked in the on than in the off dopaminergic medication state. The difference in alpha band coherence on and off medication was found to correlate with the drug related improvement in clinical parameters. Overall, the movement-related behaviour of activities in the alpha band in patients with PD serves to highlight the role of dopamine in modulating large-scale, interregional synchronisation.",

    "abstract": "The goal of our study was to investigate the influence of intraoperative microelectrode recordings and clinical testing on the location of the final stimulation site in deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease.\nIn 22 patients with Parkinson's disease we compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based and atlas-based targets with the adjusted stimulation sites after intraoperative, multitrack microelectrode recording (MER) and intraoperative and postoperative clinical testing. The investigation included 176 target/stimulation sites in 44 subthalamic nuclei (STNs), which were related to a standardised three-dimensional, MRI-defined STN.\nAtlas-based targets were positioned more superior and more medial than the MRI-based targets, which were located in the centre of the MRI-STN. The optimal stimulation sites, found intraoperatively after MER and clinical testing, were located more lateral and slightly more superior than both planned targets. In the majority of the cases the location of the active contact was the most superior and most lateral of all target sites. The differences in the distributions of those four targets reached statistical significance. However, final active contacts were distributed throughout the MRI-defined STN and its immediate surroundings.\nThe adoption of microelectrode recordings and extensive clinical testing allows the adjustment of anatomical targeting even to unexpected stimulation sites in and around the MRI-defined STN.",

    "abstract": "PRKN mutations have been linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). Most of the mutational screenings have focused on the coding exons. The 3' untranslated region (UTR) could also harbor functionally relevant nucleotide changes. We performed a mutational screening of PRKN in a cohort of early-onset PD patients (n\u2009=\u2009235) from Spain. We found 16 mutations (five new): 16 patients (7\u00a0%) carried two mutations and only one mutation was found in 28 (12\u00a0%). Patients with two mutations had significantly lower mean age (30\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u00a0years) compared to patients with one (40\u2009\u00b1\u20097) or no mutation (42\u2009\u00b1\u20097). We found a total of 15 nucleotide variants (three new) in the 3' UTR region. The frequency of carriers of the rare rs62637702 G allele (*94A/G) was significantly lower among the patients compared to healthy controls (n\u2009=\u2009418) (0.03 vs. 0.004; p\u2009<\u20090.001), suggesting a protective role for this allele. In order to investigate the basal effect of this variant, we performed luciferase assays. No different basal activity was observed between the two alleles. In conclusion, the rs62637702 polymorphism was associated with PD. This could be a surrogate marker for disease risk, in linkage disequilibrium with other non-identified functional variant.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may present delusional jealousy (DJ). In a previous cross-sectional prevalence study we identified 15 cognitively preserved and five demented PD patients with DJ. The current study aimed at evaluating their clinical (motor and non-motor) characteristics and the pharmacological treatments associated with DJ, and its subsequent pharmacological management. Patients were assessed by neurologists and psychiatrists using the Hoehn and Yahr scale, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Efficacy of DJ management was evaluated in follow-up visits. All patients were in therapy with dopamine agonists. A subgroup of five cognitively preserved patients developed DJ after a short period of treatment of therapy with dopamine agonists, while other patients developed DJ after a longer period of dopaminergic treatment. Psychiatric comorbidities were common in cognitively preserved and in demented patients. The pharmacological management included the interruption of dopamine agonists in two patients and the reduction of dopamine agonist dose plus the use of antipsychotics in other patients. These clinical data suggest that the management of medicated PD patients should include investigation for the presence of DJ and the evaluation of clinical characteristics potentially relevant to the prevention or the early recognition of delusions.",

    "abstract": "Based upon the acquainted loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease (PD), we hypothesised changes in magnetic resonance imaging signal intensities of the basal ganglia to be useful as an additional technical tool in the diagnostic work-up.\nRegion-of-interest analyses (substantia nigra and globus pallidus internus) of T2-weighted scans were performed in seventy subjects with PD, 170 age- and gender-matched controls and 38 patients with an atypical form of neurodegenerative Parkinsonian syndrome (N = 11 multisystem atrophy, N = 22 progressive supranuclear palsy, N = 5 corticobasal syndrome).\nIn patients with PD, significant changes in signal intensities within the substantia nigra were observed compared to controls at p < 0.001. For the globus pallidus internus, signal alterations in PD and progressive supranuclear palsy were found to be significant (p < 0.001) if compared to controls. Furthermore, signal changes of substantia nigra correlated with signal intensities of globus pallidus internus in the ipsilateral hemisphere in both groups. Sensitivity was 86% and specificity was 90% for the combined analysis of substantia nigra and globus pallidus internus in the complete patient sample versus controls.\nSignal alterations of substantia nigra and globus pallidus internus in routine magnetic resonance imaging were useful to distinguish patients with PD from controls. In addition, signal changes in globus pallidus internus could be used to differentiate progressive supranuclear palsy patients from controls. These analyses have the potential to serve as an additional non-invasive technical tool to support the individual differential diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a multifactorial nature due to the reduction in dopamine level in the brain. The projected number of people with Parkinson's disease is expected to increase mostly due to a greater aging population. Clinicians often face challenges in controlling the effective drug concentration in a patient's body to achieve therapeutic response throughout various stages of Parkinson's disease. To meet the therapeutic goals at different levels of Parkinson's progression, various dosage form approaches are used to enhance the delivery of anti-Parkinson's disease drugs into the brain. This review provides a summary on the available anti-Parkinson's disease drug dosage forms as well as the prototypes that are still under investigation through oral, transmucosal, transdermal, intranasal, pulmonary, rectal, and parenteral routes. These novel delivery systems will be extremely important in increasing therapeutic efficacy and reducing unwanted complications in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the frequency of cognitive impairment and depression in our Parkinson's Disease (PD) and their relationship with disease severity and disability.\nA total of 40 PD patients and 40 age-, sex-, and educationally matched controls were studied. The Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Motor and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scores and the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stage were documented. Depression was assessed using the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS), while cognition was evaluated using a composite score of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score and category fluency score.\nA total of 55% (22/40) of PD and 10% (4 of 40) of controls had depression (P<0.001). A total of 60% of PD (24/40) and 5% of controls (2/40) had cognitive impairment (P<0.001). Both NMS coexisted in 16 of 40 PD (40%) compared with none of the controls (P<0.001). UPDRS (motor and ADL) scores and HY stage were significantly worse with impaired ZSDS scores - P 0.001. UPDRS ADL was significantly impaired by the presence of cognitive impairment. Coexisting depression and cognitive impairment were associated with significant worsening of all scores of severity and disability.\nCognitive impairment and depression accompany our PD and are related to disability and worsening disease severity.",

    "abstract": "Objective : Cognitive deficit and white matter alteration relationships in Parkinson's disease (PD) were investigated. Methods : Comparison of 64 patients with PD (M:F, 34:30; 64.4 \u00b1 10.4 years) classified as cognitively normal (PD-CogNL, n = 24), mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, n = 30), and dementia (PD-D, n = 10) with 21 healthy participants (M:F, 10:11; 60.1 \u00b1 13.6 years) was conducted using white matter fractional anisotropy (FA), region-of-interest analysis, and diffusion tensor imaging. Results : The PD-D and PD-MCI exhibited higher Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores (P < .001; P < .01) and Hoehn-Yahr stages (P < .001; P < .05) and FA reductions in left frontal/right temporal white matter and bilateral anterior cingulated bundles. Largest FA reductions occurred in PD-D left anterior cingulated bundle and corpus callosum splenium. Disease durations of PD-D = 6.8 \u00b1 6.86, PD-MCI = 5.1 \u00b1 2.9, and PD-CogNL = 4.7 \u00b1 3.4 years, suggesting progressive deterioration. Conclusions : Cerebral white matter deterioration may underlie progressive cognitive impairment in PD.",

    "abstract": "P73 is a member of the p53 transcription factors family with a prominent role in neurobiology, affecting brain development as well as controlling neuronal survival. Accordingly, p73 has been identified as key player in many age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, neuroAIDS and Niemann-Pick type C disease. Here we investigate possible correlations of p73 with Parkinson disease. Tyrosine hydroxylase is a crucial player in Parkinson disease being the enzyme necessary for dopamine synthesis. In this work we show that levels of tyrosine hydroxylase can be influenced by p73. We also demonstrate that p73 can protect against tyrosine hydroxylase depletion in an in vitro model of Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in 92 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) by iodine-123 N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography. Quantitative mapping of rCBF was performed using the stereotactic extraction estimation method. The clinical features of the patients were assessed according to the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The correlation between rCBF and improvement in the UPDRS score following surgery was examined. rCBF in the fusiform gyrus, superior and inferior parietal gyri, middle occipital gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus of the Talairach Daemon Level 3 was significantly correlated with UPDRS part II (off stage) and III (on stage) scores (p < 0.05). rCBF in the middle temporal gyrus (p = 0.00147), medial frontal gyrus (p = 0.00713), and cerebellum (p = 0.048) of the Talairach Daemon Level 3 was significantly greater in 47 patients with >60% improvement of UPDRS part III (off stage) score than in 37 patients with 40-60% improvement. The cutoff value of rCBF, which indicated that >40% improvement in the surgical outcome could be expected, was 38.8 \u00b1 6.2 ml/100 g/min in the frontal lobe. This study indicated that rCBF in patients with PD might be related to their clinical features, suggesting that quantitative mapping of rCBF may be useful for predicting surgical outcome.",

    "abstract": "The mutation of the leucine-rich repeat kinase2 gene (LRRK2) is the most commonly detected genetic determinant of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the specific role of the LRRK2 mutation in the occurrence of the autosomal-dominant family PD remains to be elucidated. In this study, we report a large Chinese LRRK2-related PD family with 33 members of four generations. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood specimens of 11 family members. The common LRRK2 mutations were screened by polymerase chain reaction, followed by polymorphic restriction enzyme digestion or direct DNA sequencing. We detected the G2385R mutation, a substitution at codon 2385 to produce a glycine-to-arginine phenotype, in two affected cases and one suspected case. Our data support the concept that the LRRK2 G2385R mutation may be involved in the pathogenesis of PD in this family.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress and oxidized dopamine contribute to the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway in Parkinson's disease (PD). Selenoproteins are a family of proteins containing the element selenium in the form of the amino acid selenocysteine, and many of these proteins have antioxidant functions. We recently reported changes in expression of the selenoprotein, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase GPX4 and its co-localization with neuromelanin in PD brain. To further understand the changes in GPX4 in PD, we examine here the expression of the selenium transport protein selenoprotein P (Sepp1) in postmortem Parkinson's brain tissue. Sepp1 in midbrain was expressed in neurons of the substantia nigra (SN), and expression was concentrated within the centers of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of PD. As with GPX4, Sepp1 expression was significantly reduced in SN from PD subjects compared with controls, but increased relative to cell density. In putamen, Sepp1 was found in cell bodies and in dopaminergic axons and terminals, although levels of Sepp1 were not altered in PD subjects compared to controls. Expression levels of Sepp1 and GPX4 correlated strongly in the putamen of control subjects but not in the putamen of PD subjects. These findings indicate a role for Sepp1 in the nigrostriatal pathway, and suggest that local release of Sepp1 in striatum may be important for signaling and/or synthesis of other selenoproteins such as GPX4.",

    "abstract": "Both hyposmia and substania nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity on trascranial sonography (TCS) were risk markers for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), which was beneficial to the differential diagnosis of the disease. However, each of their single diagnostic value is often limited. The purpose of present study was to explore whether the combination of olfactory test and TCS of SN could enhance the differential diagnostic power in Chinese patients with PD.\nThirty-seven patients with PD and twenty-six patients with essential tremor (ET) were evaluated on 16-item odor identification test from extended version of sniffin' sticks and TCS of SN. The frequency of hyposmia and SN hyperechogenicity in each group was compared. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the two clinical biomarkers were analyzed.\nThe frequency of hyposmia in patients with PD was significantly higher than in patients with ET (62.2% VS. 3.8%, P\u2009=\u20090.000). The frequency of SN hyperechogenicity in patients with PD was significantly higher than in ET subjects (48.6% VS. 15.4%, P\u2009=\u20090.006). The combination of hyposmia and SN hyperechogenicity (if either one or both present) discriminated patients with PD from ET with a sensitivity of 78.4% and 29.7%, specificity of 80.8% and 100%, PPV of 85.3% and 100%, and NPV of 72.4% and 50.0%, respectively.\nOur preliminary data suggested that the combination of hyposmia and SN hyperechogenicity could improve the diagnostic potential for discriminating Chinese patients with PD from ET.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder particularly characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Pesticide exposure has been associated with PD occurrence, and we previously reported that the fungicide benomyl interferes with several cellular processes potentially relevant to PD pathogenesis. Here we propose that benomyl, via its bioactivated thiocarbamate sulfoxide metabolite, inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), leading to accumulation of the reactive dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), preferential degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and development of PD. This hypothesis is supported by multiple lines of evidence. (i) We previously showed in mice the metabolism of benomyl to S-methyl N-butylthiocarbamate sulfoxide, which inhibits ALDH at nanomolar levels. We report here that benomyl exposure in primary mesencephalic neurons (ii) inhibits ALDH and (iii) alters dopamine homeostasis. It induces selective dopaminergic neuronal damage (iv) in vitro in primary mesencephalic cultures and (v) in vivo in a zebrafish system. (vi) In vitro cell loss was attenuated by reducing DOPAL formation. (vii) In our epidemiology study, higher exposure to benomyl was associated with increased PD risk. This ALDH model for PD etiology may help explain the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in PD and provide a potential mechanism through which environmental toxicants contribute to PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Herbal medicines have attracted considerable attention in recent years, which are used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) in China based on traditional Chinese medicine or modern pharmacological theories. We summarized and analyzed the anti-Parkinsonian activities of herbal medicines and herbal formulations investigated in PD models and provide future references for basic and clinical investigations. All the herbal medicines and herbal formulations were tested on PD models in vitro and in vivo. The relevant compounds and herbal extracts with anti-Parkinsonian activities were included and analyzed according to their genera or pharmacological activities. A total of 38 herbal medicines and 11 herbal formulations were analyzed. The relevant compounds, herbal extracts and formulations were reported to be effective on PD models by modulating multiple key events or signaling pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. The plant species of these herbal medicines belong to 24 genera and 18 families, such as Acanthopanax, Alpinia and Astragalus, etc. These herbal medicines can be an alternative and valuable source for anti-Parkinsonian drug discovery. The plant species in these genera and families may be the most promising candidates for further investigation and deserve further consideration in clinical trials. Active components in some of the herbal extracts and the compatibility law of herbal formulations remain to be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "Previous reports have shown an increased risk for Parkinson disease (PD) among type 1 Gaucher disease (GD) patients. However, the number of the reported cases of GD/PD is small and it is unknown whether certain GD phenotypes are associated with an increased PD risk.\nTo present GD and PD characteristics of adults affected by both diseases from a large Israeli GD clinic, and assess whether certain GD characteristics are associated with a higher risk for PD.\nMedical files of patients >18years between 1990 and 2010 were reviewed for PD signs or symptoms. Available patients with PD underwent an additional neurological examination. Demographic and GD characteristics were compared between GD patients with and without PD using t-test and Fisher exact. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate age-specific risk for PD among males and females. Age-specific risk for PD was compared between males and females using Cox Hazard ratio model.\n510 type 1 GD adults (233 males; 45.7%), were evaluated. 11 PD patients were identified (2.2%). Among those with GD/PD cognitive impairment was common (7/11). Two patients underwent successful deep brain stimulation (DBS). PD diagnosis was associated with male gender (81.8% versus 44.9% male, p=0.027) and older age (mean age, PD=62.8, non-PD=47.1, p=0.004). GD phenotype and severity did not differ between the two groups, including mean Zimran Severity Score index (7.7 versus 8.3), percent splenectomized (15.8% versus 27.3%), history of avascular necrosis (13.0% versus 27.3%) and percent ever treated with enzyme replacement (49.4% versus 45.5%).\nMale gender and older age are risk factors for PD among GD patients, but GD severity is not associated with increased risk for PD. Further research is required to assess which GD patients are at a higher risk for PD, and why.",

    "abstract": "Dual task (DT) performance assesses the ability to perform two tasks simultaneously. Difficulty with DT performance may be a sensitive indicator of early Parkinson's disease (PD) impairment. The objective of this study was to assess what elements of a DT performance (cognition or gait) are most associated with impairment and disability in PD.\nPerformance in single and DT conditions was examined in 154 PD patients. The single task assessments included the time required to walk 50 feet (gait speed) and the number of words generated in a verbal fluency task (word generation). The DT comprised simultaneous performance of the single tasks. Impairment and disability were measured with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn &Yahr, Berg Balance Scale, and Older Americans Resource and Services Scale. Age, education, and gender were control variables. Standardized residuals from regressions of DT upon single task performance were computed separately for word and gait, indicating the extent that the individual performed proportionally better/worse than predicted in DT considering their single task performance.\nMultiple regressions revealed that individuals who performed worse than expected in DT-word had greater impairment and disability. Dual task-gait was not significant in any model. Verbal fluency during DT performance is more closely associated with PD-related impairment and disability than gait speed during DT.\nThis suggests that subjects prioritize gait performance at the expense of cognitive performance, and that DT word generation may be a sensitive indicator of early PD impairment and disability.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a variety of motor symptoms including freezing of gait (FOG), in which walking is transiently halted as if the patient's feet were 'glued to the ground'. Treatment of FOG is still challenging. Although L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPS), a precursor of noradrenaline, has been on the market in Japan because of its beneficial effect for FOG, clinical use of L-DOPS has been far from satisfying. However, the fact that there were some responders to L-DOPS encouraged us to hypothesize that the enhancement of L-DOPS concentration in the brain by the co-administration of L-DOPS and a catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor, which is expected to interrupt L-DOPS metabolism in the peripheral circulation, would be beneficial for FOG. Based on our hypothesis, we conducted a preliminary study with a small number of participants with FOG. Of the 16 PD patients with FOG who completed this study, group 1 (n=6) received L-DOPS co-administered with entacapone, which is a COMT inhibitor used worldwide as an anti-parkinson drug, group 2 (n=5) received entacapone alone, and group 3 (n=5) received L-DOPS alone. Only the patients in group 1 showed a significant improvement in FOG. Moreover, the beneficial effect was observed only in patients with levodopa-resistant FOG. This result supports our hypothesis, at least in patients with levodopa-resistant FOG, and shows that the co-administration of L-DOPS and entacapone could be a new strategy for FOG treatment.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing dopaminergic neuronal development and function in novel genetic animal models might uncover strategies for researchers to develop disease-modifying treatments for neurologic disorders. Id2 is a transcription factor expressed in the developing central nervous system. Id2(-/-) mice have fewer dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb and reduced olfactory discrimination, a pre-clinical marker of Parkinson's disease. Here, we summarize behavioral, histological and in vitro molecular biological analyses to determine whether midbrain dopaminergic neurons are affected by Id2 loss. Id2(-/-) mice were hyperactive at 1 and 3 months of age, but by 6 months showed reduced activity. Id2(-/-) mice showed age-dependent histological alterations in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpC) associated with changes in locomotor activity. Reduced dopamine transporter (DAT) expression was observed at early ages in Id2(-/-) mice and DAT expression was dependent on Id2 expression in an in vitro dopaminergic differentiation model. Evidence of neurodegeneration, including activated caspase-3 and glial infiltration, were noted in the SNpC of older Id2(-/-) mice. These findings document a novel role for Id2 in the maintenance of midbrain dopamine neurons. The Id2(-/-) mouse should provide unique opportunities to study the progression of neurodegenerative disorders involving the dopamine system.",

    "abstract": "The non-motor consequences of subthalamic stimulation are largely questioned. Cognition, motivation, anxiety, depression and even occurrence of suicides have been considered as a potential consequence of the surgical intervention. Non-motor fluctuations are present in all the patients with motor fluctuations and may sometimes be even more invalidating. Interestingly, subthalamic deep brain stimulation alleviates non-motor fluctuations allowing strikingly successful effects on sensory, dysautonomic and cognitive fluctuations while psychic fluctuations respond less consistently to this treatment. Nevertheless, severe mood fluctuations, oscillating from Off dysphoria to ON hypomania, are frequently associated with addictive behaviors and improve dramatically after subthalamic stimulation. This may be a further argument to support the indication of surgery for these patients.",

    "abstract": "To quantify the thickness of the inner retinal layers in the foveal pit where the nerve fiber layer (NFL) is absent, and quantify changes in the ganglion cells and inner plexiform layer. Pixel-by-pixel volumetric measurements were obtained via Spectral-Domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) from 50 eyes of Parkinson disease (PD) (n\u00a0=\u00a030) and 50 eyes of healthy control subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a027). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were used to classify individual subjects with respect to sensitivity and specificity calculations at each perifoveolar distance. Three-dimensional topographic maps of the healthy and PD foveal pit were created. The foveal pit is thinner and broader in PD. The difference becomes evident in an annular zone between 0.5 and 2\u00a0mm from the foveola and the optimal (ROC-defined) zone is from 0.75 to 1.5\u00a0mm. This zone is nearly devoid of NFL and partially overlaps the foveal avascular zone. About 78\u00a0% of PD eyes can be discriminated from HC eyes based on this zone. ROC applied to OCT pixel-by-pixel analysis helps to discriminate PD from HC retinae. Remodeling of the foveal architecture is significant because it may provide a visible and quantifiable signature of PD. The specific location of remodeling in the fovea raises a novel concept for exploring the mechanism of oxidative stress on retinal neurons in PD. OCT is a promising quantitative tool in PD research. However, larger scale studies are needed before the method can be applied to clinical follow-ups.",

    "abstract": "To examine time trends and the influence of socio-demographic and geographic factors on incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis in a large UK population-based cohort from The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a UK primary care database. All patients aged over 50 years and contributing data to THIN between January 1999 and December 2009 were extracted and the incidence rates of PD diagnoses were determined by age, gender, time period, social deprivation score and urban/rural status. The overall incidence of PD diagnosis for people over 50 years was 84 per 100,000 person years (95 % CI 82-85). After accounting for socio-demographic factors, the adjusted incidence rates in men were 46 % higher (95 % CI 43-48 %) than in women. Adjusted incidence rates were also 12 % higher in urban than rural areas (95 % CI 4-20 %) and slightly lower in less socially deprived areas. Over time there was a downward trend in PD diagnosis with the adjusted incidence rates declining by around 6 % every calendar year (95 % CI 5-6 %) between 1999 and 2009. Broadening the definition of PD from diagnostic codes to include symptoms and antiparkinsonian drug prescriptions increased the overall incidence to 118 per 100,000 person years (95 % CI 116-120) and showed a much weaker downward trend over time of around 1 % per calendar year (95 % CI 1-2 %). With the broader definition, the adjusted incidence rates remained significantly higher in men compared to women and in urban areas compared with rural areas but not in socially deprived areas. The PD diagnosis rates in the primary care setting were, as expected, higher in men, and slightly higher in urban areas, but not different between socio-economic groups. There was a decline in PD diagnosis in the primary care setting, which may largely represent changes in diagnosis and/or coding rather than a true decline in incidence.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and has been attributed to early deposition of \u03b1-synuclein pathology in olfactory areas. The pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction in PD, however, remains poorly understood. Changes in odor identification suggest in part impairment in odor memory, possibly due to hippocampal dysfunction. Olfactory dysfunction occurs also in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and increases with severity of dementia. Cholinergic degeneration is not only a feature of AD but can also occur in PD, at least in a subset of patients with cognitive changes. We reported previously that impaired odor identification in early PD is more closely correlated with hippocampal dopaminergic than nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation. Results of our multi-tracer PET studies show that odor identification deficits in PD are best predicted by cholinergic denervation and to a lesser extent by dopaminergic denervation. These results suggest that olfactory dysfunction in PD may have multiple components including hippocampal dysfunction secondary to cholinergic and dopaminergic denervations. Olfactory dysfunction in PD may be the most marked in subjects at risk of incipient dementia, and may reflect the transition of PD toward a stage with more heterogeneous multi-system neurodegenerations. Our preliminary imaging data do not support a significant contribution of amyloidopathy or serotoninergic denervation to abnormal olfactory functions in PD, at least in the absence of dementia. We outline how progressive changes in olfaction may be used as a biomarker of cholinergic denervation and cognitive decline in PD patients. We will discuss also the utility of olfactory testing as an early screening test for neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "To assess the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) compared to control subjects and their timing of appearance in relationship to the onset of motor symptoms. There is a rostrocaudal gradient of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-SYN) neuropathology in the enteric nervous system at early stages of PD with higher burden in the upper than the lower gut. However, only constipation has been recognized as a premotor gastrointestinal manifestation of PD. 129 PD patients and 120 controls underwent a structured questionnaire to assess the presence of GIS and, in PD patients, the time of their appearance respect to the onset of motor manifestations. GIS significantly more prevalent in PD patients were dry mouth, drooling, dysphagia, constipation and defecatory dysfunction. Constipation and defecatory dysfunction preceded motor manifestations. Whereas gastroparesis symptoms preceded motor manifestations, their prevalence was not significantly different from controls. Despite evidence of a higher \u03b1-SYN burden in the upper gut, only constipation and defecatory dysfunction were prominent premotor GIS of PD.",

    "abstract": "Road-crossing safety is an important issue in an aging society. Information regarding the risk of crossing the street to pedestrians with Parkinson's disease (PD) is limited. To assess the risk and predictors of unsafe crossing behaviors in patients with PD, we compared 31 pedestrians with mild-to-moderate PD to 50 age/gender/education-matched controls using a battery of cognitive, visual, and motor tests. With a simulated simple street-crossing situation, we determined the remaining time and safety margin for each participant in different traffic situations, including variable motor vehicle speed, time gap, and time of the day. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated by logistic regression models. We found that pedestrians with PD were more vulnerable to traffic accidents than controls (OR 1.61 [1.28-2.02], P=0.01). The risk of crossing road correlated in a dose-dependent manner with the severity of PD, based on both Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stages and unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) motor scores (OR 1.13 for each increasing point of UPDSR, P<0.01). Among PD patients, scores of clock drawing test (OR 0.8 [0.74-0.88], P<0.01) and visual form discrimination (OR 1.14 [1.07-1.22], P<0.01) predicted worsening of safety errors, rather than executive function. Environmental factors, such as fast approaching motor vehicle speed (OR 4.50 [2.92-6.95], P<0.01), short time gap (OR 45.98 [27.04-78.18], P<0.01), and time of day (OR 4.45 [3.11-6.36], P<0.01) also affected road-crossing safety. Future large sample studies are needed to confirm our findings. Training programs or portable stimulator devices that compensate for the visual-spatial disabilities of PD patients are required to improve road safety for PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a motor disorder that involves death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Parkin is an autosomal recessive gene that is mutated in early onset PD. We investigated the role of parkin and autophagic clearance in postmortem nigrostriatal tissues from 22 non-familial sporadic PD patients and 15 control samples. Parkin was insoluble with altered cytosolic expression in the nigrostriatum of sporadic PD. Parkin insolubility was associated with lack of degradation of ubiquitinated proteins and accumulation of \u03b1-Synuclein and parkin in autophagosomes, suggesting autophagic defects in PD. To test parkin's role in mediating autophagic clearance, we used lentiviral gene transfer to express human wild type or mutant parkin (T240R) with \u03b1-Synuclein in the rat striatum. Lentiviral expression of \u03b1-Synuclein led to accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, while co-expression of parkin with \u03b1-Synuclein facilitated autophagic clearance. Subcellular fractionation showed accumulation of \u03b1-Synuclein and tau hyper-phosphorylation (p-Tau) in autophagosomes in gene transfer models, similar to the effects observed in PD brains, but parkin expression led to protein deposition into lysosomes. However, parkin loss of function mutation did not affect autophagic clearance. Taken together, these data suggest that functional parkin regulates autophagosome clearance, while decreased parkin solubility may alter normal autophagy in sporadic PD.",

    "abstract": "The effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on gait and balance vary and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. DBS location may alter motor benefit due to anatomical heterogeneity in STN. The purposes of this study were to (1) compare the effects of DBS of dorsal (D-STN) versus ventral (V-STN) regions on gait, balance and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and (2) examine the relationships between changes in rCBF and changes in gait and balance induced by D-STN or V-STN DBS.\nWe used a validated atlas registration to locate and stimulate through electrode contacts in D-STN and V-STN regions of 37 people with Parkinson's disease. In a within-subjects, double-blind and counterbalanced design controlled for DBS settings, we measured PET rCBF responses in a priori regions of interest and quantified gait and balance during DBS Off, unilateral D-STN DBS and unilateral V-STN DBS.\nDBS of either site increased stride length without producing significant group-level changes in gait velocity, cadence or balance. Both sites increased rCBF in subcortical regions and produced variable changes in cortical and cerebellar regions. DBS-induced changes in gait velocity are related to premotor cortex rCBF changes during V-STN DBS (r=-0.40, p=0.03) and to rCBF changes in the cerebellum anterior lobe during D-STN DBS (r=-0.43, p=0.02).\nDBS-induced changes in gait corresponded to rCBF responses in selected cortical and cerebellar regions. These relationships differed during D-STN versus V-STN DBS, suggesting DBS acts through distinct neuronal pathways dependent on DBS location.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is one of the most frequent progressive degenerative disorders with unknown origin of the nervous system. The commutation of the disease on Guam led to the discovery of a neurotoxin which was also found in other continents. This neurotoxin was identified in the common cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). Early clinical observations suggested some loose correlations with gastric and duodenal ulcer and Parkinson's disease, while recent studies revealed a toxin, almost identical to that found in cyanobacteria in one strain of Helicobacter pylori, which proved to cause Parkinson like symptoms in animals. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that there is a slowly progressive poisoning in Parkinson's disease. The disease specific alpha-sinuclein inclusions can be found in nerve cells of the intestinal mucosa far before the appearance of clinical symptoms indicating that the disease may start in the intestines. These results are strengthened by the results of Borody's fecal transplants, after which in Parkinson patients showed a symptomatic improvement. Based on these observations the Parkinson puzzle is getting complete. Although these observations are not evidence based, they may indicate a new way for basic clinical research, as well as a new way of thinking for clinicians. These new observations in psycho-neuro-immunology strengthen the fact that immunological factors may also play a critical factor facilitating local cell necrosis which may be influenced easily.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with three cardinal features of pathology: 1. Aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein into intraneuronal structures called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. 2. Dysregulated immune activation in the substantia nigra (SN). 3. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal circuit. The largely correlative nature of evidence in humans has precluded a decisive verdict on the relationship between \u03b1-synuclein pathology, inflammation, and neuronal damage. Furthermore, it is unclear whether inflammation plays a role in the early prodromal stages of PD before neuronal damage has occurred and Parkinsonian motor symptoms become apparent. To gain insight into the interaction between the inflammatory response and the development of neuronal pathology in PD, Watson et al. characterized neuroinflammation in a wild-type \u03b1-synuclein overexpressing mouse model of prodromal PD. They demonstrate, for the first time, the existence of early and sustained microglial mediated innate inflammation that precedes damage to the nigrostriatal circuit. Additionally they observe the spread of inflammation from the striatum to the SN. This study suggests that early dysregulated inflammation may contribute to progressive nigrostriatal pathology in PD, although the initiating factor that triggers the inflammatory response remains elusive. The novel concept of an early inflammatory response in the development of PD has important implications for preventive and therapeutic strategies for PD.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine is produced first by hydroxylalation of l-tyrosine to l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-dopa) and subsequently by the decarboxylation of l-dopa to dopamine catalysed by the enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) respectively. Reduced glutathione (GSH) acts as a major cellular antioxidant. We have investigated the role of dopamine in the control of GSH homeostasis in brain cells. The SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line was found to increase intracellular GSH levels in response to 50\u03bcM dopamine treatment. Similarly the 1321N1 human astrocytoma cell line was found to increase GSH release in response to 50\u03bcM dopamine. The same concentration of l-dopa was also found to increase intracellular GSH in SH-SY5Y cells, however when AADC was inhibited this affect was abolished. Furthermore 1321N1 cells which were found to have almost undetectable levels of AADC activity did not increase GSH release in response to 50\u03bcM l-dopa. These results suggest that at these concentrations dopamine has the potential to act as a signal for the upregulation of GSH synthesis within neuronal-like cells and for the increased trafficking of GSH from astrocytes to neurons. This effect could potentially relate to the activation of antioxidant response elements leading to the induction of phase II detoxifying enzymes including those involved in GSH synthesis and release. The inability of l-dopa to produce a similar effect when AADC was inhibited or when AADC activity was absent indicates that these effects are relatively specific to dopamine. Additionally dopamine but not l-dopa treatment led in an increase in complex I activity of the respiratory chain in SH-SY5Y cells which may be related to the effect of dopamine on GSH levels.",

    "abstract": "1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is a neurotoxic side product formed in the chemical synthesis of desmethylprodine opioid analgesic, which induces Parkinson disease. Monoamine oxidase B, present in the mitochondrial outer membrane of glial cells, catalyzes the oxidation of MPTP to the toxic 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+)), which then targets the dopaminergic neurons causing neuronal death. Here, we demonstrate that mitochondrion-targeted human cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), supported by mitochondrial adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase, can efficiently catalyze the metabolism of MPTP to MPP(+), as shown with purified enzymes and also in cells expressing mitochondrial CYP2D6. Neuro-2A cells stably expressing predominantly mitochondrion-targeted CYP2D6 were more sensitive to MPTP-mediated mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and complex I inhibition than cells expressing predominantly endoplasmic reticulum-targeted CYP2D6. Mitochondrial CYP2D6 expressing Neuro-2A cells produced higher levels of reactive oxygen species and showed abnormal mitochondrial structures. MPTP treatment also induced mitochondrial translocation of an autophagic marker, Parkin, and a mitochondrial fission marker, Drp1, in differentiated neurons expressing mitochondrial CYP2D6. MPTP-mediated toxicity in primary dopaminergic neurons was attenuated by CYP2D6 inhibitor, quinidine, and also partly by monoamine oxidase B inhibitors deprenyl and pargyline. These studies show for the first time that dopaminergic neurons expressing mitochondrial CYP2D6 are fully capable of activating the pro-neurotoxin MPTP and inducing neuronal damage, which is effectively prevented by the CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine.",

    "abstract": "The author suggests a hypothesis on the origin of tremor. The hypothesis is based on the results of electromyographic (EMG) study using cutaneous electrodes in patients with tremor-rigid form of Parkinson's disease before and after the stereotaxic surgery. The natural afferent impulses from receptive areas of the organism, in particular, from proprioreceptors or muscle filaments, are thought to be the energetic basis of hyperkineses. The wakeful brain conducts the excessive non-specific information along the inhibitory premotor-caudata-pallidal-thalamic-motor pathway (caudatal loop). This mechanism does not work in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the deficit of brain dopamine that affects the control over static gamma-motoneurons. On the spinal level, a myotatic unit with the involvement of the static \u03b3-motoneuron, nuclear chain intrafusal fiber, pathway 1a, phasic \u03b3-motoneuron and phasic oxidative extrafusal muscle fiber is responsible for the development of trembling hyperkinesis. The hypothesis allows to understand deeper the pathogenesis of tremor and to evaluate the results of surgical treatment as well.",

    "abstract": "Central to ethically justified clinical trial design is the need for an informed consent process responsive to how potential subjects actually comprehend study participation, especially study goals, risks, and potential benefits. This will be particularly challenging when studying deep brain stimulation and whether it impedes symptom progression in Parkinson's disease, since potential subjects will be Parkinson's patients for whom deep brain stimulation will likely have therapeutic value in the future as their disease progresses.\nAs part of an expanded informed consent process for a pilot Phase I study of deep brain stimulation in early stage Parkinson's disease, an ethics questionnaire composed of 13 open-ended questions was distributed to potential subjects. The questionnaire was designed to guide potential subjects in thinking about their potential participation.\nWhile the purpose of the study (safety and tolerability) was extensively presented during the informed consent process, in returned responses 70 percent focused on effectiveness and 91 percent included personal benefit as poten- tial benefit from enrolling. However, 91 percent also indicated helping other Parkinson's patients as motivation when considering whether or not to enroll.\nThis combination of responses highlights two issues to which investigators need to pay close attention in future trial designs: (1) how, and in what ways, informed consent processes reinforce potential subjects' preconceived understandings of benefit, and (2) that potential subjects see themselves as part of a community of Parkinson's sufferers with responsibilities extending beyond self-interest. More importantly, it invites speculation that a different paradigm for informed consent may be needed.",

    "abstract": "Biomarkers are required for the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression in Parkinson disease (PD). To date, most studies have concentrated on \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn), a protein involved in Parkinson disease pathogenesis, as a potential biomarker, with inconsistent outcomes. Recently, naturally occurring autoantibodies against \u03b1-Syn (\u03b1-Syn-nAbs) have been detected in the serum of patients with PD. They represent a putative diagnostic marker for PD.\nWe established and validated an ELISA to quantify \u03b1-Syn-nAbs in serum samples. We analyzed serum samples from 62 patients with PD, 46 healthy controls (HC), and 42 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) using this newly established ELISA. Additionally, serum levels of endogenous \u03b1-Syn were measured.\nThere was a significant difference in \u03b1-Syn-nAbs levels between the investigated groups (p = 0.005; Kruskal-Wallis test). Levels of \u03b1-Syn-nAbs were significantly lower in patients with PD compared to HC (p < 0.05; Dunn multiple comparison post hoc test) or patients with AD (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we detected no difference between patients with AD and HC. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay for patients with PD vs. HC were 85% and 25%, respectively. The \u03b1-Syn-nAbs levels did not correlate with age, Hoehn & Yahr status, or duration of disease. Endogenous \u03b1-Syn had no influence on \u03b1-Syn-nAbs levels in sera.\nUsing a well-validated assay, we detected reduced \u03b1-Syn-nAbs levels in patients with PD compared to patients with AD and HC. The assay did not achieve criteria for use as a diagnostic tool to reliably distinguish PD from HC. Further studies are needed to assess \u03b1-Syn-nAbs as a biomarker in PD.",

    "abstract": "Hypokinetic dysarthria in Parkinson's disease (PD) can be characterized by monotony of pitch and loudness, reduced stress, variable rate, imprecise consonants, and a breathy and harsh voice. Using acoustic analysis, we studied the effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied over the primary orofacial sensorimotor area (SM1) and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on motor aspects of voiced speech in PD. Twelve non-depressed and non-demented men with PD (mean age 64.58 \u00b1 8.04 years, mean PD duration 10.75 \u00b1 7.48 years) and 21 healthy age-matched men (a control group, mean age 64 \u00b1 8.55 years) participated in the speech study. The PD patients underwent two sessions of 10 Hz rTMS over the dominant hemisphere with 2,250 stimuli/day in a random order: (1) over the SM1; (2) over the left DLPFC in the \"on\" motor state. Speech examination comprised the perceptual rating of global speech performance and an acoustic analysis based upon a standardized speech task. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare acoustic speech variables between controls and PD patients. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare data prior to and after each stimulation in the PD group. rTMS applied over the left SM1 was associated with a significant increase in harmonic-to-noise ratio and net speech rate in the sentence tasks. With respect to the vowel task results, increased median values and range of Teager-Kaiser energy operator, increased vowel space area, and significant jitter decrease were observed after the left SM1 stimulation. rTMS over the left DLPFC did not induce any significant effects. The positive results of acoustic analysis were not reflected in a subjective rating of speech performance quality as assessed by a speech therapist. Our pilot results indicate that one session of rTMS applied over the SM1 may lead to measurable improvement in voice quality and intensity and an increase in speech rate and tongue movements. Nevertheless, these changes were not accompanied by changes in a perceptual evaluation of speech performance by a speech therapist. Future placebo-controlled studies in larger patient cohorts should verify if rTMS would be clinically useful for treating hypokinetic dysarthria in PD.",

    "abstract": "The applause sign has been associated with various neurodegenerative diseases. We investigate its validity in the differential diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy and Parkinson's disease, and its relationship with neuropsychological tests.\n23 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and 106 patients with Parkinson's disease were included and administered the following scales: progressive supranuclear palsy rating scale, unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), frontal assessment battery (FAB), neuropsychiatric inventory and three-clap test.\n73.9% with progressive supranuclear palsy and 21.7% with Parkinson's disease showed a positive applause sign. Only a positive applause sign, UPDRS II score and disease duration were found to be predictors of progressive supranuclear palsy. Both patient-groups showed statistically significant correlations between the applause sign and neuropsychological tests: in progressive supranuclear palsy patients MMSE correlation coefficient: 0.62 (p: 0.002) and FAB correlation coefficient: 0.48 (p: 0.02), and in Parkinson's disease patients MMSE correlation coefficient: 0.47 (p<0.001) and FAB correlation coefficient: 0.43 (p<0.001). Verbal fluency and inhibitory control (FAB) and writing and orientation in time (MMSE) discriminated between patients with normal and positive applause sign.\nA positive applause sign is not specific to progressive supranuclear palsy and may also be observed in Parkinson's disease patients with altered cognition, and it's related to cortical frontal abnormalities such as language disorders and inhibitory control.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder, and its molecular etiopathogenesis remains poorly understood. The discovery of monogenic forms has significantly advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PD, as it allows generation of cellular and animal models carrying the mutant gene to define pathological pathways. Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause dominantly inherited PD, and variations increase risk, indicating that LRRK2 is an important player in both genetic and sporadic forms of the disease. G2019S, the most prominent pathogenic mutation, maps to the kinase domain and enhances enzymatic activity of LRRK2, which in turn seems to correlate with cytotoxicity. Since kinases are druggable targets, this has raised great hopes that disease-modifying therapies may be developed around modifying LRRK2 enzymatic activity. Apart from cytotoxicity, changes in autophagy have been consistently reported in the context of G2019S mutant LRRK2. Here, we will discuss current knowledge about mechanism(s) by which mutant LRRK2 may regulate autophagy, which highlights additional putative therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental disorder. Here we identified two mutations in the G-protein-coupled receptor 37 gene (GPR37) localized on chromosome 7q31-33, called the AUTS1 region, of ASD patients; 1585-1587 ttc del (Del312F) in one Japanese patient and G2324A (R558Q) in one Caucasian patient. The Del312F was located in the conserved transmembrane domain, and the R558Q was located in a conserved region just distal to the last transmembrane domain. In addition, a potential ASD-related GPR37 variant, T589M, was found in 7 affected Caucasian men from five different families. Our results suggested that some alleles in GPR37 were related to the deleterious effect of ASD. GPR37 is associated with the dopamine transporter to modulate dopamine uptake, and regulates behavioral responses to dopaminergic drugs. Thus, dopaminergic neurons may be involved in the ASD. However, we also detected the Del321F mutation in the patient's unaffected father and R558Q in not only an affected brother but also an unaffected mother. The identification of unaffected parents that carried the mutated alleles suggested that the manifestation of ASD was also influenced by factors other than these mutations, including endoplasmic reticulum stress of the mutated proteins or gender. Our study will provide the new insight into the molecular pathogenesis of ASD.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this multicenter observational study \"Optimization levodopa therapy for patients with Parkinson's disease\" (OPTIMA) was to evaluate the current practice of prescribing levodopa to patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) by general practitioners and specialists in the treatment of extrapyramidal disorders in Russia. The study included 763 patients with PD, stages from I to V according to Hoehn and Yahr staging of PD. Patients were randomized into three groups. Group I included 230 patients not previously treated with levodopa who needed treatment with this drug due to the motor deficit progression. Group 2 consisted of 262 patients treated with levodopa/carbidopa (nakom) who needed higher doses or the dose redistribution. Group 3 included 271 patients treated earlier with other levodopa preparations and currently needed treatment with levodopa/carbidopa (nakom). Primary symptoms of parkinsonism, motor deficit (motor fluctuations, dyskinesia) and non-motor symptoms (depression) were reduced after the beginning of treatment as well as after the increase in doses. The results revealed that the addition of levodopa/carbidopa can improve daily activities with the low risk of side-effects.",

    "abstract": "The decreased ability to carry out vertical saccades is a key symptom of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). Objective measurement devices can help to reliably detect subtle eye movement disturbances to improve sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis. The present study aims at transferring findings from restricted stationary video-oculography (VOG) to a wearable head-mounted device, which can be readily applied in clinical practice.\nWe investigated the eye movements in 10 possible or probable PSP patients, 11 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and 10 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) using a mobile, gaze-driven video camera setup (EyeSeeCam). Ocular movements were analyzed during a standardized fixation protocol and in an unrestricted real-life scenario while walking along a corridor.\nThe EyeSeeCam detected prominent impairment of both saccade velocity and amplitude in PSP patients, differentiating them from PD and HCs. Differences were particularly evident for saccades in the vertical plane, and stronger for saccades than for other eye movements. Differences were more pronounced during the standardized protocol than in the real-life scenario.\nCombined analysis of saccade velocity and saccade amplitude during the fixation protocol with the EyeSeeCam provides a simple, rapid (<20 s), and reliable tool to differentiate clinically established PSP patients from PD and HCs. As such, our findings prepare the ground for using wearable eye-tracking in patients with uncertain diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have reported that antioxidants play an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD). Garcinia indica extract is a natural antioxidant, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of methanolic extract of Garcinia indica (GIM) against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) neurotoxicity for striatal dopaminergic neurons in the rat.\nThirty adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups namely control, 6-OHDA model, and GIM (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg body weight suspended in one ml of 0.1% carboxymethyl cellulose). The treatment was started three days before surgery and continued for next 14 days. The surgery was done on third day in all groups for administration of 6-OHDA into the right striatum and right substantia nigra, whereas control group injected with 6-OHDA vehicle. Various behavior and biochemical tests (Apomorphine-induced rotational behavior, Stepping test, Initiation time, Postural balance test, and Disengage time) were used to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of GIM. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's test was used to compare inter-group differences. P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\nGIM had significant (P<0.05, P<0.01) preventive effect in biochemical tests, i.e., dopamine and its metabolites measurement and in various behavior tests, i.e., apomorphine-induced rotational behavior, stepping test, initiation time, postural balance test, and disengage time as compared to 6-OHDA-treated rats.\nOur results demonstrated that GIM acted as an effective neuroprotective agent for striatal dopaminergic neurons in 6-OHDA lesioned rat model of PD.",

    "abstract": "Previous research suggests that oscillatory coupling between cortex, basal ganglia and muscles plays an important role in motor behavior. Furthermore, there is evidence that oscillatory coupling is altered in patients with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we performed simultaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG), local field potential (LFP) and electromyogram (EMG) recordings in PD patients selected for therapeutic subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation. Patients were recorded (i) after withdrawal of anti-parkinsonian medication (OFF) and (ii) after levodopa administration (ON). We analyzed STN-cortical and cortico-muscular coherence during static forearm contraction and repetitive hand movement in order to evaluate modulations of coherence by movement and medication. Based on previous results from studies investigating resting state coherence in PD patients, we selected primary motor cortex (M1) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) as regions of interest. We found beta coherence between M1 and STN to be suppressed by administration of levodopa. M1-muscular coherence was strongly reduced in the alpha and beta band during repetitive movement compared to static contraction, but was unaffected by administration of levodopa. Strong STG-STN but not STG-muscular coherence could be observed in the alpha band. Coherence with STG was modulated neither by movement nor by medication. Finally, we found both M1-STN and M1-muscular beta coherence to be negatively correlated with UPDRS akinesia and rigidity sub-scores in the OFF state. The present study provides new insights into the functional roles of STN-cortical and cortico-muscular coherence and their relationship to PD symptoms. The results indicate that STN-cortical and cortico-muscular coupling are correlated, but can be modulated independently. Moreover, they show differences in their frequency-specific topography. We conclude that they represent partly independent sub-loops within the motor system. Given their negative correlation with akinesia, neither can be considered \"antikinetic\".",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons' disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder that is a consequence of premature death of dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra. A number of observations have led to the hypothesis that environmental factors, including pesticides, play a significant role in the development of PD. Among pesticides, most commonly herbicides (paraquat in particular) and insecticides have been considered. The aim of this study is to address the uncertainties provided by epidemiological studies on the role of pesticide exposures in the development of PD, with the help of experimental toxicological data. Animal models that reproduce all clinical and pathological features of human PD are not available. In addition, the fundamental questions relate to the extrapolation from experimental to actual human exposure, taking also into account the role of genetic factors. Available measurements or estimates of human exposure levels that are significantly lower than those used in animal experimentation provide little support for a causal correlation between pesticide exposure and development of PD in humans. A possible role of acute poisonings or episodes of excessive exposure, and/or of combined exposures especially at early age and/or in the presence of certain genetic variants can be hypothesised. Follow up of survivors of acute poisonings by pesticides would provide information useful in this respect. According to the available data, from a public health point of view, prevention of \"high\" exposures, even asymptomatic ones, especially in utero and during early age is a priority.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel analysis method for positron emission tomography (PET) data that uses the spatial characteristics of the radiotracer's distribution within anatomically-defined regions of interest (ROIs) to provide an independent feature that may aid in characterizing pathological and normal states. The analysis of PET data for research purposes traditionally involves kinetic modeling of the concentration of the radiotracer over time within a ROI to derive parameters related to the uptake/binding of the radiotracer in the body. Here we describe an analysis method to quantify the spatial changes present in PET images based on 3D shape descriptors that are invariant to translation, scaling, and rotation, called 3D moment invariants (3DMIs). An ROI can therefore be characterized not only by the radiotracer's uptake rate constant or binding potential within the ROI, but also the 3D spatial shape and distribution of the radioactivity throughout the ROI. This is particularly relevant in Parkinson's disease (PD), where both the kinetic and the spatial distribution of the tracer are known to change due to disease: the posterior parts of the striatum (in particular in the putamen) are affected before the anterior parts. Here we show that 3DMIs are able to quantify the spatial distribution of PET radiotracer images allowing for discrimination between healthy controls and PD subjects. More importantly, 3DMIs are found to be well correlated with subjects' scores on the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (a clinical measure of disease severity) in all anatomical regions studied here (putamen, caudate and ventral striatum). On the other hand, kinetic parameters only show significant correlation to clinically-assessed PD severity in the putamen. We also find that 3DMI-characterized changes in spatial patterns of dopamine release in response to l-dopa medication are significantly correlated with PD severity. These findings suggest that quantitative studies of a radiotracer's spatial distribution may provide complementary information to kinetic modeling that is relatively robust to intersubject variability and may contribute novel information in PET neuroimaging studies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological disease presenting with motor and non-motor signs and symptoms. Approximately 30-50% of the patients experience pain. There is no consensus regarding the mechanisms and classification of pain in PD. This paper reviews current data on the possible mechanisms, classifications, evaluation and potential risk factors for pain in PD. Literature searches were performed to identify clinical trials and reviews covering patho-physiology, classification, type, evaluation and risk factors associated with pain in PD. Pain in PD could be related to pathologic changes in the anatomic structures involved in nociceptive mechanisms. Studies on pain mechanisms have been mostly conducted in animals. The mechanism of pain is complicated and influenced by different factors. There are several methodological differences between the studies trying to classify pain and to characterize its subtypes. Potential risk factors for pain in PD include: age, gender, and duration of the disease. Although pain is one of the non-motor symptoms most frequency experienced by patients, it is often under recognized and inadequately treated in contrast to motor symptoms Multicenter studies are needed that include a large cohort of subjects evaluated in multiple dimensions including pain in order to obtain more data and to allow improved management of pain in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is a common symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, a multidimensional scale that measures the impact of fatigue on functioning has yet to be validated in this population. The aim of this study was to examine the validity of the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), a self-report measure that assesses the effects of fatigue on physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning, in a sample of nondemented PD patients.\nPD patients (N = 100) completed the MFIS, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X), and several additional measures of psychosocial, cognitive, and motor functioning. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and item analysis using Cronbach's alpha were conducted to determine structural validity and internal consistency of the MFIS. Correlational analyses were performed between the MFIS and the PANAS-X fatigue subscale to evaluate convergent validity and between the MFIS and measures of depression, anxiety, apathy, and disease-related symptoms to determine divergent validity.\nThe PCA identified two viable MFIS subscales: a cognitive subscale and a combination of the original scale's physical and psychosocial subscales as one factor. Item analysis revealed high internal consistency of all 21 items and the items within the two subscales. The MFIS had strong convergent validity with the PANAS-X fatigue subscale and adequate divergent validity with measures of disease stage, motor function, and cognition.\nOverall, this study demonstrates that the MFIS is a valid multidimensional measure that can be used to evaluate the impact of fatigue on cognitive and physical/social functioning in PD patients without dementia.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine contributes to corticostriatal plasticity and motor learning. Dopamine denervation profoundly alters motor performance, as in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the extent to which these symptoms reflect impaired motor learning is unknown. Here, we demonstrate a D2 receptor blockade-induced aberrant learning that impedes future motor performance when dopamine signaling is restored, an effect diminished by coadministration of adenosine antagonists during blockade. We hypothesize that an inappropriate corticostriatal potentiation in striatopallidal cells of the indirect pathway underlies aberrant learning. We demonstrate synaptic potentiation in striatopallidal neurons induced by D2 blockade and diminished by application of an adenosine antagonist, consistent with behavioral observations. A neurocomputational model of the basal ganglia recapitulates the behavioral pattern and further links aberrant learning to plasticity in the indirect pathway. Thus, D2-mediated aberrant learning may contribute to motor deficits in PD, suggesting new avenues for the development of therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder with increased oxidative stress as central component. Till date, treatments related to PD are based on restoring dopamine either by targeting neurotransmitter and/or at receptor levels. These therapeutic approaches try to repair damage but do not address the underlying processes such as oxidative stress and neuroinflammation that contribute to cell death. The central nervous system maintains a robust antioxidant defense mechanism consisting of several cytoprotective genes and enzymes whose expression is controlled by antioxidant response element (ARE) which further depends on activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). In response to oxidative or electrophilic stress transcription factor Nrf2 binds to ARE and rescues the cells from oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Recently, Nrf2 has been utilized as a drug target and some agents are currently under clinical trial. Owing to the potential role of Nrf2 in counteracting oxidative stress and neuroinflammation seen in PD, here we have focused on the molecular mechanism of the Nrf2/ARE antioxidant defense pathway in PD. Further, we also summarize published reports on the potential inducers of Nrf2 that demonstrate neuroprotective effects in experimental models of PD with possible future strategies to increase the transcriptional level of Nrf2 as a therapeutic strategy to provide neuroprotection of damaged dopaminergic neurons in PD.",

The etiology of idiopathic PD is likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Despite findings from mammalian studies that have provided significant insight into the disorder, the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathophysiology are still poorly understood. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a powerful system for genetic analysis. Considering C. elegans short lifespan, fully sequenced genome, high genetic and neurobiochemical conservation with humans, as well as the availability of facile genetic tools, the nematode represents a highly efficient and effective model system to explore the molecular basis of PD. In this review we describe the utility of C. elegans for PD research, and the opportunity the model system presents to identify therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Positive correlations have been suggested between usage of pesticides and the incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD) through epidemiological as well as few experimental evidences. Organophosphorus insecticides (OPI), which are extensively used in agricultural and household insect control, have been the subject of increasing concern in the past decades due to their neurotoxic potential. However, very few studies have demonstrated the potentials of OPI to induce features of PD in model organisms. In the present study, Caenorhabditis elegans was selected as the model organism to evaluate the potential of monocrotophos (MCP), an OPI, to elicit dopaminergic features of Parkinson's disease in terms of dopamine content, basic movement and integrity of dopaminergic neurons along with its effect on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and life span. All the responses elicited by MCP were compared with that elicited by 1-methyl-4-phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in both N2 and BZ555 worms. N2 worms were exposed to varying concentrations of MCP (50, 100 and 200 \u03bcM) or MPTP (200, 300 and 400 \u03bcM) for 48 hours and locomotory rate, as measured by the number of body bends made in 20 seconds, was enumerated. Worms subjected to the same dose paradigms were also analyzed for the dopamine content by HPLC. The results indicated a significant reduction in the dopamine levels in the worms that were treated with MCP/MPTP and this correlated with the changes in locomotion compared to untreated worms. Worms treated with MCP also exhibited significant reduction in AChE activity. Both MPTP and MCP caused a marked reduction in life span in the worms. Transgenic worms (BZ555, which has GFP tagged to its 8 dopaminergic neurons) exposed to MCP and MPTP at the above concentrations showed a dose-dependent reduction in the number of green pixels in CEP and ADE neurons which also correlated with the neurodegeneration as visualized by decreased fluorescence in photomicrographs. Taken together, our data demonstrate that low levels of MCP elicits dopaminergic features of PD in C. elegans.",

Existing literature suggests a link between pesticide exposure and increased incidence of PD. We carried out the present study to look into the stress gene expression pattern of transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model of PD after exposure to pesticides from different classes. Expression level of sod-1, sod-2, sod-3, hsp-70, hsp-60, and hsp-16.2 stress responsive genes was determined using qPCR. Our findings demonstrate that the expression of stress related genes does not follow a generalized pattern to different toxicants; rather each pesticide class has a specific expression signature.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia and the cerebellum are anatomically and functionally linked to the cerebral cortex through a series of well-established circuits. The disruption of dopaminergic projections in Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to an imbalance within these circuits, leading to motor and cognitive symptoms. The cortico-cerebellar (CC) network has often been viewed as a compensatory network, helping the dysfunction of the cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuits in PD. However, evidence for this compensatory role is scarce; most changes in cerebellar activity could equally be attributed to pathophysiological changes underlying PD. This paper will review the anatomy, interaction and function of the CBG and CC circuits, the pathophysiological, metabolic, and functional changes observed in PD, as well as the effect of levodopa and deep brain stimulation on these changes. We will use this framework to discuss the pathophysiological and compensatory mechanisms behind CBG and CC circuit activity in PD.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether amyloid burden, as indexed by Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) retention, identifies patients with Parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) compared to those with normal cognition (PD-nl). A related aim is to determine whether amyloid burden predicts cognitive decline in a cohort of subjects with PD without dementia.\nIn this prospective cohort study, we examined 46 subjects with PD without dementia, of whom 35 had normal cognition and 11 met criteria for PD-MCI at study baseline. All subjects underwent standardized neurologic and neuropsychological examinations and PiB PET at baseline, and clinical examinations were conducted annually for up to 5 years.\nAt baseline, precuneus PiB retention did not distinguish PD-MCI from PD-nl. Subjects with PD-MCI declined more rapidly than PD-nl subjects on cognitive tests of memory, executive function, and activation retrieval. Of the 35 PD-nl subjects, 8 progressed to PD-MCI and 1 to dementia; of the 11 PD-MCI subjects, 5 converted to dementia. Both higher PiB retention and a diagnosis of PD-MCI predicted a greater hazard of conversion to a more severe diagnosis. Baseline PiB retention predicted worsening in executive function over time. The APOE \u03b54 allele also related to worsening in executive function, as well as visuospatial function, activation retrieval, and performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination. In contrast to its relation to cognitive decline, PiB retention did not affect progression of motor impairment.\nAt baseline measurements, amyloid burden does not distinguish between cognitively impaired and unimpaired subjects with PD without dementia, but our data suggest that amyloid contributes to cognitive, but not motor, decline over time.",

    "abstract": "Although levodopa and dopaminergic drugs remain the mainstay of therapy for the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD), they fail to address many of the non-motor symptoms of PD including orthostatic hypotension, freezing of gait (FOG) and difficulty with balance, drug-induced paranoia and hallucinations, and drug-induced dyskinesias. Droxidopa, a drug that increases norepinephrine, treats orthostatic hypotension, cholinomimetic drugs sometimes help with FOG and difficulty with balance, pimavanserin, a drug that blocks serotonin receptors, treats paranoia and hallucinations, and anti-glutaminergic drugs treat dyskinesias. Thus, there are ample opportunities for non-dopaminergic drugs in PD.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD) clinical trials, Parkinson's disease is studied using multiple outcomes of various types (e.g. binary, ordinal, continuous) collected repeatedly over time. The overall treatment effects across all outcomes can be evaluated based on a global test statistic. However, missing data occur in outcomes for many reasons, e.g. dropout, death, etc., and need to be imputed in order to conduct an intent-to-treat analysis. We propose a Bayesian method based on item response theory to perform multiple imputation while accounting for multiple sources of correlation. Sensitivity analysis is performed under various scenarios. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed method outperforms standard methods such as last observation carried forward and separate random effects model for each outcome. Our method is motivated by and applied to a Parkinson's disease clinical trial. The proposed method can be broadly applied to longitudinal studies with multiple outcomes subject to missingness.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the LRRK2 gene cause autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease. LRRK2 encodes a multi-domain protein containing a Ras-of-complex (Roc) GTPase domain, a C-terminal of Roc domain and a protein kinase domain. LRRK2 can function as a GTPase and protein kinase, although the interplay between these two enzymatic domains is poorly understood. Although guanine nucleotide binding is critically required for the kinase activity of LRRK2, the contribution of GTP hydrolysis is not known. In general, the molecular determinants regulating GTPase activity and how the GTPase domain contributes to the properties of LRRK2 remain to be clarified. Here, we identify a number of synthetic missense mutations in the GTPase domain that functionally modulate GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis and we employ these mutants to comprehensively explore the contribution of GTPase activity to the kinase activity and cellular phenotypes of LRRK2. Our data demonstrate that guanine nucleotide binding and, to a lesser extent, GTP hydrolysis are required for maintaining normal kinase activity and both activities contribute to the GTP-dependent activation of LRRK2 kinase activity. Guanine nucleotide binding but not GTP hydrolysis regulates the dimerization, structure and stability of LRRK2. Furthermore, GTP hydrolysis regulates the LRRK2-dependent inhibition of neurite outgrowth in primary cortical neurons but is unable to robustly modulate the effects of the familial G2019S mutation. Our study elucidates the role of GTPase activity in regulating kinase activity and cellular phenotypes of LRRK2 and has important implications for the validation of the GTPase domain as a molecular target for attenuating LRRK2-mediated neurodegeneration.",

The release is operated by vagal-abdominal projections and has therefore been suggested as a test for vagal nerve integrity. Pathoanatomical and clinical studies indicate vagal dysfunction in early Parkinson's disease (PD).\nWe assessed the postprandial secretion of pancreatic polypeptide and motilin in healthy controls (n = 18) and patients with idiopathic rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD, n = 10), a potential premotor stage of PD, as well as in drug-naive (n = 19) and treated (n = 19) PD patients.\nThe postprandial pancreatic polypeptide secretion showed a physiological pattern in all groups and even an enhanced response in drug-naive PD and iRBD. Motilin concentrations correlated with pancreatic polypeptide concentrations.\nPostprandial pancreatic polypeptide secretion is not a suitable test for vagal nerve integrity in PD. The unimpaired pancreatic polypeptide response in iRBD and PD might be explained by partially intact vagal-abdominal projections or compensatory mechanisms substituting a defective neuronal brain-gut axis.",

    "abstract": "Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is caused by preexcitation of the ventricular myocardium via an accessory pathway which increases the risk for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The condition is often sporadic and of unknown etiology in the majority of cases. Autosomal dominant inheritance and association with congenital heart defects or ventricular hypertrophy were described. Microdeletions of 20p12.3 have been associated with WPW syndrome with either cognitive dysfunction or Alagille syndrome. Here, we describe the association of 20p12.3 duplication with WPW syndrome in a patient who presented with non-immune hydrops. Her paternal uncle carries the duplication and has attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and electrocardiographic findings consistent with WPW. The 769\u2009kb duplication was detected by the Affymetrix Whole Genome-Human SNP Array 6.0 and encompasses two genes and the first two exons of a third gene. We discuss the potential role of the genes in the duplicated region in the pathogenesis of WPW and possible neurobehavioral abnormalities. Our data provide additional support for a significant role of 20p12.3 chromosomal rearrangements in the etiology of WPW syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Although motor impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) are attributed to nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation, postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) features are less responsive to dopaminergic medications. PIGD features are a risk factor also for the development of dementia in PD (PDD). These observations suggest that nondopaminergic mechanisms may contribute to axial motor impairments. The aim was to perform a correlative PET study to examine the relationship between neocortical \u03b2-amyloid deposition ([(11)C]-Pittsburgh Compound B), nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation ([(11)C]-dihydrotetrabenazine), and PIGD feature severity in PD patients at risk for dementia. This was a cross-sectional study of 44 PD patients (11 female and 33 male; 69.5 \u00b1 6.6 years of age; 7.0 \u00b1 4.8 years motor disease duration; mean H & Y stage: 2.7 \u00b1 0.5) who underwent PET, motor feature severity assessment using the Movement Disorder Society revised UPDRS, and the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS). Linear regression (R(2)(adj) = 0.147; F(4,39) = 2.85; P = 0.036) showed that increased PIGD feature severity was associated with increased neocortical [(11)C]-Pittsburgh Compound B binding (\u03b2 = 0.346; t(39) = 2.13; P = 0.039) while controlling for striatal [(11)C]-dihydrotetrabenazine binding, age, and DRS total score. Increased neocortical \u03b2-amyloid deposition, even at low-range levels, is associated with higher PIGD feature severity in PD patients at risk for dementia. This finding may explain why the PIGD motor phenotype is a risk factor for the development of PDD.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has documented cognitive impairment in the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). It is not known when this decline starts or if decline progresses at an accelerated rate during the premotor period of the disorder. In this population-based prospective study of older people (\u226565 years) from the Neurological Disorders in Central Spain (NEDICES) cohort, we compared the rates of cognitive decline in 3 groups: (1) non-PD elderly controls; (2) prevalent PD patients (those diagnosed with the disease at baseline, 1994-95); and (3) premotor PD subjects (those diagnosed with the disease at follow up, 1997-98, but not at baseline). A 37-item version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (37-MMSE) was administered in the 2 visits of the study. From 2487 participants (age, 72.8 \u00b1 6.0 years), including 2429 controls, we recruited 21 premotor PD cases, and 37 prevalent PD cases. At baseline, the mean 37-MMSE score was 28.5 \u00b1 4.7 in prevalent cases, 28.1 \u00b1 4.6 in premotor cases, and 29.9 \u00b1 5.0 in controls (P = .046). During the 3-year follow-up period, there was a significant score decline of 2.4 \u00b1 4.6 points in prevalent cases versus 0.2 \u00b1 4.1 points in premotor cases and 0.3 \u00b1 4.0 points in controls (Kruskal-Wallis test, P = .03). In the NEDICES cohort, cognitive test scores of prevalent PD cases declined at a rate above and beyond that observed in premotor PD cases and in controls. The rate of cognitive decline in premotor PD and controls was similar. Our data suggest that a decline in global cognitive function does not occur in premotor PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work was to study cerebral vasoreactivity to hypercapnia in Parkinson's disease (PD) before and after levodopa administration. The prospective study was conducted in 20 patients presenting with PD, using 3T blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) covering the whole brain. The hypercapnic stimulus was block-designed using carbogen inhalation, a gas mixture of 7% CO2 and 93% O2, before (OFF) and 60 minutes after administration of a suprathreshold (120%) therapeutic L-dopa dose (ON). Ten age-matched controls were enrolled for between-group comparisons. Analyses were conducted with a random effects model and corrected for multiple comparisons. No adverse reaction to the hypercapnic stimulus was reported. However, 10 patients and 2 controls were excluded because of incomplete protocol realization, inappropriate hypercapnic stimulus, or excessive movements, leaving 10 patients and 8 controls for further analyses. The hypercapnic stimulus increased whole-brain BOLD signal of 1.48% \u00b1 0.06% (mean \u00b1 standard error) in controls, 1.59% \u00b1 0.05% in patients OFF, and 1.62% \u00b1 0.09% in patients ON. Regions of interest analyses showed a signal increase in gray matter of 2.60% \u00b1 0.16% in controls, 2.89% \u00b1 0.21% in patients OFF, and 2.87% \u00b1 0.12% in patients ON. No global or regional significant difference was detected, when comparing patients OFF and ON L-dopa, or between patients and controls. Contrary to Alzheimer's disease, the vasoreactivity to hypercapnia was normal in PD before and after L-dopa administration, compared to controls. This negative result is an important finding, especially for neuroscientists using fMRI to investigate motricity and cognition, discarding a significant confounding effect.",

    "abstract": "The study was done to identify the candidate causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and candidate causal mechanisms that contribute to Parkinson's disease (PD) susceptibility and to generate a SNP to ene to pathway hypothesis using an analytical pathway-based approach. We used a PD genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis data of the genotypes of 2,525,705 SNPs in 4,238 PD cases and 4,239 controls. Identify candidate Causal SNPs and Pathways (ICSNPathway) analysis was applied to the PD GWAS dataset. The first stage involved the pre-selection of candidate causal SNPs by linkage disequilibrium analysis and the functional SNP annotation of the most significant SNPs found. The second stage involved the annotation of biological mechanisms for the pre-selected candidate causal SNPs using improved-gene set enrichment analysis. ICSNPathway analysis identified three candidate SNPs, two genes, twenty-one pathways, and three hypothetical biological mechanisms: (1) rs17651549 to microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) to protein domain specific binding (nominal p < 0.001, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.001), neurogenesis (nominal p < 0.001, FDR < 0.001), regulation of neurogenesis (nominal p < 0.001, FDR = 0.001), positive regulation of axonogenesis (nominal p < 0.001, FDR = 0.001), regulation of protein polymerization (nominal p < 0.001, FDR = 0.004), negative regulation of organelle organization (nominal p < 0.001, FDR = 0.004), hsa01510 (nominal p < 0.001, FDR = 0.005), neuron differentiation (nominal p < 0.001, FDR = 0.009), and axonogenesis (nominal p < 0.001, FDR = 0.009); (2) rs10445337 to MAPT to protein domain specific binding (nominal p < 0.001, FDR < 0.001), neurogenesis (nominal p < 0.001, FDR < 0.001), regulation of neurogenesis (nominal p < 0.001, FDR = 0.001), and positive regulation of axonogenesis (nominal p < 0.001, FDR = 0.001); (3) rs9938550 to HSD3B7 to hsa00363 (nominal p < 0.001, FDR = 0.004), bile acid metabolic process (nominal p = 0.005, FDR = 0.019), and steroid metabolic process (nominal p = 0.010, FDR = 0.039). By applying the ICSNPathway analysis to PD GWAS meta-analysis data, three candidate SNPs, two genes (MAPT and HSD3B7), and 21 pathways involving protein domain specific binding and neurogenesis were identified, which may contribute to PD susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa effectively relieves motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), but has had inconsistent effects on cognition, even worsening some aspects of cognitive functioning. Therefore, remediation of PD cognitive deficits is a major unmet need. However, drug development efforts have been hampered by lack of an animal model in which motor and cognitive deficits can be examined simultaneously.\nCynomolgus monkeys were trained to perform cognitive tasks and then chronically exposed to MPTP to slowly produce cognitive and motor deficits of parkinsonism.\nAdministration of L-dopa to these animals dose dependently improved motor functioning, but did not significantly improve cognitive performance. At doses that maximally improved motor function, additional cognitive deficits were observed. The present model of MPTP-induced parkinsonism recapitulates important motor and cognitive aspects of PD.

    "abstract": "Cellular models for Parkinson's disease (PD) represent a fast and efficient tool in the screening for drug candidates and factors involved in the disease pathogenesis. The objective of this study was to establish and characterize a survival and toxic cellular model for PD by culturing dopaminergic neurons from embryonic chicken ventral midbrain. We show that as in rodents, the common neurotrophic factors--brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)--are able to support the survival of chicken midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, after treatment with MPP\u207a or rotenone as in vitro models for PD, the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells decreased drastically. This effect could be significantly rescued by treatment with BDNF or GDNF. Together, our results indicate that mechanisms of neuroprotection of dopaminergic neurons are conserved between chicken and mammals. This supports the use of primary culture from chicken embryonic midbrain as a suitable tool for the study of neuroprotection in vitro.",

To analyze the possible biomarkers for the early diagnosis, we investigated the metabolite changes in different brain regions of PD-MCI patients as well as appropriate controls by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).\nThe metabolism in the occipital lobe, posterior cingulate, substantia nigra and basal ganglia was studied in 66 PD-MCI patients, 70 cognitively normal PD patients (PD-CN) and 74 healthy controls.\nThe N-acetylaspartate to creatine (NAA/Cr) ratio in the occipital lobe in PD-MCI patients was lower than that in healthy controls (P < 0.05). In contrast, the choline to creatine ratio in the posterior cingulate was higher in PD-MCI patients than in controls or PD-CN patients (both P < 0.05). No significant metabolite difference in the substantia nigra and basal ganglia was found. Furthermore, the decreases of the ratios of NAA/Cr in the occipital lobe were associated with PD-CN (P < 0.05) and PD-MCI (P < 0.0001) while the increase in the ratio of Cho/Cr in the posterior cingulate was associated with PD-MCI (P \u2264 0.01).\nThe metabolite changes in the occipital lobe and posterior cingulate occur in the early cognitive impairment phase of PD patients.

    "abstract": "Gait abnormalities are a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and contribute to fall risk. Therapy and exercise are often encouraged to increase mobility and decrease falls. As disease symptoms progress, assistive devices are often prescribed. There are no guidelines for choosing appropriate ambulatory devices. This unique study systematically examined the impact of a broad range of assistive devices on gait measures during walking in both a straight path and around obstacles in individuals with PD. Quantitative gait measures, including velocity, stride length, percent swing and double support time, and coefficients of variation were assessed in 27 individuals with PD with or without one of six different devices including canes, standard and wheeled walkers (two, four or U-Step). Data were collected using the GAITRite and on a figure-of-eight course. All devices, with the exception of four-wheeled and U-Step walkers significantly decreased gait velocity. The four-wheeled walker resulted in less variability in gait measures and had less impact on spontaneous unassisted gait patterns. The U-Step walker exhibited the highest variability across all parameters followed by the two-wheeled and standard walkers. Higher variability has been correlated with increased falls. Though subjects performed better on a figure-of-eight course using either the four-wheeled or the U-Step walker, the four-wheeled walker resulted in the most consistent improvement in overall gait variables. Laser light use on a U-Step walker did not improve gait measures or safety in figure-of-eight compared to other devices. Of the devices tested, the four-wheeled-walker offered the most consistent advantages for improving mobility and safety.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of Parkinson's disease (PD). Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may progress to dementia more frequently and rapidly. PD dementia (PDD) and PD-MCI have a mean prevalence up to 75% each; a four- to six-times increased incidence rate compared with controls. Recent diagnostic clinical criteria for both PDD and PD-MCI require validation. Cognitive decline in PD can be probed clinically, comprehensive neuropsychological assessment being the best way to define it. Neuroimaging in both disorders revealed cortical atrophy, hypometabolism, white matter changes, dopaminergic/cholinergic dysfunction and increased amyloid burden. Combined analysis of imaging and cerebrospinal fluid markers (tau and A\u03b2-42) is the most promising method for indentifying PD-MCI and PDD. Morphological substrates are a combination of Lewy and Alzheimer pathologies causing destruction of essential neuronal networks. PDD and dementia with Lewy bodies are considered similar parts of a disease spectrum. Treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors revealed mild-to-moderate results.",

    "abstract": "Psychiatric symptoms are now well described in Parkinson's disease (PD). Most are due to the disease pathology with exacerbation caused by dopaminergic treatment. Anxiety and depression may predate the onset of motor symptoms and can continue to occur with advancing disease. In patients with parkinsonism, well-formed hallucinations are highly specific for PD and some patients may progress to other psychotic symptoms. Cognitive impairment, ranging from mild impairment to dementia is common. Management of these symptoms involves initial recognition and secondly, appropriate medications. Pharmacological treatments are not specific for PD and are the same as those currently used in nonPD populations. The choice of agent is determined by a balance between potential benefit versus side effects, mostly in terms of worsening motor PD symptoms. This article will review current treatment approaches to mood disorders, psychosis and cognitive problems in PD, as well as management of dopamine-induced impulse control disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder leading to progressive motor impairment for which there is no cure. Currently, the diagnosis is made by the presence of cardinal motor features and several associated non-motor symptoms. However, at this point, the underlying neuropathological changes are already underway, and efforts in basic and clinical research have converged to suggest that Parkinson's disease actually begins well before symptom onset. As a result, the identification and development of disease-modifying therapies is difficult. In this review, we begin by summarizing what is known of disease pathogenesis in the context of early symptomatology. We then discuss the Parkinson's at-risk syndrome and highlight how this conceptual framework can be a useful for studies of early disease biomarkers and putative disease-modifying neurotherapeutics. With this framework, we discuss several clinical assessments, radiological studies and molecular assays that may be useful in early disease detection.",

    "abstract": "The motor and non-motor symptoms associated with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) may compromise the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of some individuals living with this debilitating condition. Although growing evidence suggests that PD may be more prevalent in rural communities, there is little information about the life quality of these individuals. This study examines whether HRQOL ratings vary in relation to rural and metropolitan life settings.\nAn analytic cross-sectional study was conducted to compare the HRQOL of two separate samples of people with PD living in metropolitan Melbourne and rural Victoria. The metropolitan sample consisted of 210 individuals who had participated in the baseline assessment for an existing clinical trial. The rural sample comprised 24 participants who attended community-based rehabilitation programs and support groups in rural Victoria. Health-related quality of life was quantified using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39).\nThe HRQOL of participants in rural Australia differed from individuals living in a large metropolitan city (p=0.025). Participants in rural Australia reported worse overall HRQOL, after controlling for differences in disease duration. Their overall HRQOL was lower than for city dwellers. Rural living was also found to be a significant negative predictor of HRQOL (\u03b2=0.14; 95% CI -1.27 to -0.08; p=0.027).\nThe findings of this study suggest that some people with PD living in rural Victoria perceive their HRQOL to be relatively poor. In order to minimise the debilitating consequences of this disease, further studies examining the factors that may contribute to the HRQOL of individuals living in rural and remote areas are required.",

    "abstract": "DJ-1 is a multifunctional protein that plays an important role in oxidative stress, cell death, and synucleinopathies, including Parkinson disease. Previous studies have demonstrated that total DJ-1 levels decrease in the cerebrospinal fluid, but do not change significantly in human plasma from patients with Parkinson disease when compared with controls. In this study, we measured total DJ-1 and its isoforms in whole blood of patients with Parkinson disease at various stages, Alzheimer disease, and healthy controls to identify potential peripheral biomarkers of PD. In an initial discovery study of 119 subjects, 7 DJ-1 isoforms were reliably detected, and blood levels of those with 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal modifications were discovered to be altered in late-stage Parkinson disease. This result was further confirmed in a validation study of another 114 participants, suggesting that, unlike total DJ-1 levels, post-translationally modified isoforms of DJ-1 from whole blood are candidate biomarkers of late-stage Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is currently based on the clinical evaluation of extrapyramidal signs with a considerable error rate. The identification of specific markers might allow PD diagnosis before the onset of classical motor symptoms. By two-dimensional electrophoresis we identified proteome alterations in T-lymphocytes of 17 control subjects and 15 PD patients. The observed changes were used to build predictive models that were verified by the leave-one-out cross-validation. We further built two functions able to stage the subjects. We chose to verify by Western blotting the identity of spots corresponding to \u03b2-fibrinogen and transaldolase, two recurrent proteins in six out of 20 spots. \u03b2-Fibrinogen levels are lowered in PD patients, whereas a heavy transaldolase set of isoforms was more abundant. Eventually, we identified a list of seven proteins showing different levels in early-onset with respect to late-onset PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Sinemet, a combination drug containing carbidopa and levodopa is considered the gold standard therapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). When approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1988, a maximum daily dosage limit of 800 mg (eight tablets) of the 25/100 carbidopa/levodopa formulation was introduced. Overall, the FDA approval was a historic success; however, the pill limit has been hardcoded into many online medical record systems. This study investigates the 800 mg threshold by using a prospectively collected database of patient information.\nA retrospective cohort study: (Part I) cross-sectional, (Part II) longitudinal.\nPD patients at a Movement Disorders Center in a large academic, tertiary medical setting.\nAn analysis was performed using carbidopa/levodopa at dosages below and above the 800 mg threshold. A secondary analysis was then performed using two consecutive clinic visits to determine the effects of crossing the 800 mg threshold. Comparisons were made on standardised scales.\nThere was no significant difference in motor, mood and quality-of-life scores in patients consuming below and above the 800 mg carbidopa/levodopa threshold, though a mild worsening in dyskinesia duration was noted without worsening in dyskinesia pain and disability. In PD patients who crossed the 800 mg threshold between two consecutive clinic visits, a significant improvement in depressive symptoms and quality-of-life measures was demonstrated, and in these patients there was no worsening of motor fluctuations or dyskinesia.\nThe data suggest that PD patients have the potential for enhanced clinical benefits when eclipsing the 800 mg carbidopa/levodopa threshold. Many patients will likely need to eclipse the 800 mg threshold and pharmacies and insurance companies should be aware of the requirements that may extend beyond approval limits.",

    "abstract": "Impulse control disorders (ICD) have been recognised in Parkinson's disease (PD) as adverse effects of dopamine replacement therapy, particularly with dopamine agonists. Although virtually all PD patients are treated with dopaminergic drugs, only a minority will develop hyperdopaminergic states, suggesting predisposing and/or protecting factors. The age at onset, the sex and the dose or type of dopaminergic drugs have been identified as clinical predictive factors. Recent genetic studies have investigated associations between ICD and polymorphisms of genes involved in the dopamine metabolism pathway (COMT, DAT), dopamine receptors (DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4), serotonin receptors and its transporter (HTR2A, 5HTT), and glutamate receptors (GRIN2B). Although validation in larger and independent cohorts is needed, the results from these studies give us some insights into the pathophysiology of hyperdopaminergic states and may be useful, at term, in personalising antiparkinsonian treatment in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Established substance addictions and impulse control disorders (ICDs) such as pathological gambling share similar underlying neurobiology, and recent data extends these commonalities to the risk factors that increase an individuals' susceptibility to develop such behaviours. In Parkinson's disease (PD), impulse control disorders (ICDs) are increasingly recognised to develop after patients begin dopamine (DA) restoration therapy, in particular DA agonists. In both the PD and non-PD population, more impulsive individuals are at increased risk for impulse control disorders. Here, we review the neuroimaging data confirming the connection between addiction and ICDs, and revealing how DA agonists might cause specific alterations of basal ganglia and cortical function that vary as a function of an individuals' propensity for impulsivity.",

    "abstract": "Beside the presence of cognitive deficits, impaired activities of daily living (ADL) are crucial for the diagnosis of dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD). Several scales can be used to evaluate PD patients' ADL (dys)function. However, only a few of them sufficiently discriminate between demented and non-demented PD patients. It is well-known that the diagnostic accuracy of ADL scales for Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is influenced by confounding variables such as motor worsening.\nTo evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ADL scales for PDD.\nIn a cohort of 106 patients (21 with dementia), we evaluated observer-based activities of daily living rating scales (e.g. Pill Questionnaire, Schwab & England Scale), caregiver assessments, and patient questionnaires (e.g. Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale).\nEach inventory showed moderate or even high specificity for dementia (>75.3%). Sensitivity was highest for the Pill Questionnaire (90.5%). Interestingly, the ratings of caregivers and trained clinical observers overestimated the presence of dementia.\nStandardized activities of daily living assessments like the Pill Questionnaire accompanied by neuropsychological testing can be a helpful tool for the diagnosis of PDD. Further studies are needed to verify these first results in larger cohorts.",

In addition, TDP-43 pathology has been observed across a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Herein we report the presence of a TDP-43 mutation in a patient with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The TDP-43 p.N267S substitution has been previously implicated in both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. Our findings widen the phenotypic presentation for the TDP-43 p.N267S substitution and support a possible role for rare TDP-43 mutations presenting with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson Disease (PD) and Huntington Disease (HD) are degenerative neurological diseases, which can result in impairments and activity limitations affecting the upper extremities from early in the disease process. The progressive nature of these diseases poses unique challenges for therapists aiming to effectively maximize physical functioning and minimize participation restrictions in these patient groups. Research is underway in both diseases to develop effective disease-modifying agents and pharmacological interventions, as well as mobility-focused rehabilitation protocols. Rehabilitation, and in particular task-specific interventions, has the potential to influence the upper extremity functional abilities of patients with these degenerative conditions. However to date, investigations of interventions specifically addressing upper extremity function have been limited in both PD, and in particular HD. In this paper, we provide an update of the known pathological features of PD and HD as they relate to upper extremity function. We further review the available literature on the use of outcome measures, and the clinical management of upper extremity function in both conditions. Due to the currently limited evidence base in both diseases, we recommend utilization of a clinical management framework specific for degenerative conditions that can serve as a guideline for disease management.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by a progressive neurodegeneration of the dopaminergic neurons. The available pharmacological therapy for PD aims to stop the progress of symptoms, reduce disability, slowing the neurodegenerative process and/or preventing long-term complications along the therapy. The main strategic developments that have led to progress in the medical management of PD have focused on improvements in dopaminergic therapies. Despite all the recent research, there are only a few classes of drugs approved for the treatment of motor related symptoms of PD which primarily act on the dopaminergic neurons system: L-dopa, dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) and catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors. Anticholinergic drugs and glutamate antagonists are also available but are not commonly used in routine practice. As no effective therapeutic strategy has yet been attended, other solutions must be investigated. Privileged structures, such as indoles, arylpiperazines, biphenyls and benzopyranes are currently ascribed as helpful approaches. Different families of nitrogen and oxygen heterocycles, such as pyrazoles, hydrazinylthiazoles, xanthones, coumarins or chromones have also been extensively used as scaffolds in medicinal chemistry programs for searching novel MAO-B inhibitors. Nitrogen derivatives play a key role in this subject with several studies pointing out hydrazines, thiazoles or indoles as important scaffolds for the development of novel MAO-B inhibitors. This review comprises an overview of the state of the art on the actual pharmacological therapy for PD followed by a specific focus on the discovery and development of nitrogen-based heterocyclic compounds analogues as promising MAO-B inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The subthalamic nucleus (STN), historically referred to as the corpus Luysii, is a relatively small nucleus located in the junction between the diencephalon and midbrain. An important discovery was made in the late 1980s by Miller and DeLong putting the focus on the STN demonstrating abnormal hyperactivity in this area in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treated non-human primates. Shortly after, Benazzouz and colleagues showed STN deep brain stimulation (DBS) to significantly improve MPTP induced parkinsonian symptoms, including rigidity and bradykinesia in monkeys. In the same year, Pollak et al. were the first to publish a French case report describing the potential of STN DBS in a patient with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) in whom they observed improvement of akinesia. Many other prospective studies showed similar improvements of motor symptoms and the lowering of required levodopa dosage. The great success of STN DBS for the treatment of advanced PD is underlined by the growing number of patients treated. STN DBS also provided additional insight into the role of the STN, which is important not only in motor control but also in cognitive and emotional functions.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of non-dopaminergic degeneration to disability in Parkinson's disease (PD) is still debated. It has been argued that no additional advance can be expected in the management of PD by the development of new dopaminergic agents and suggested that future research should mainly focus on therapies targeting the non-dopaminergic systems involved in the pathogenesis of levodopa resistant motor and non-motor symptoms. We believe this is only partially true and the achievement of a stable dopaminergic restoration and modulation of the dopaminergic system is still an important, unmet need of current pharmacological therapies in PD. Currently available oral levodopa and dopamine agonist medications provide insufficient benefit, as the therapeutic window progressively narrows and motor fluctuations eventually develop in most patients. Conversely, the application of infusion and surgical therapies is limited by selective indications and possible irreversible adverse events and device-related problems. Research of new, safer and less invasive strategies, able to modulate the dopaminergic circuits, would certainly improve the management of motor complications, and most importantly such treatments would be also beneficial to axial and non-motor symptoms, which are universally regarded as the major cause of PD functional disability. Indeed, gait and balance problems may improve with dopaminergic treatment in most patients and they become unresponsive only at the very late stages of the disease. Moreover, several non-motor disturbances, including cognition and depression are often linked to oscillation of dopamine concentrations, and are frequently relieved by treatments providing continuous dopaminergic delivery. Finally, drug trials testing non-dopaminergic treatments for motor and non-motor symptoms of PD provided so far disappointing results. Despite the impressive advances of PD therapeutic strategy, we think there is still need for safe, non-invasive and easily manageable dopaminergic treatments able to provide constant dopamine receptor stimulation and ensure a more stable control of dopamine responsive motor and non-motor symptoms at any stage of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Motor complications of Parkinson's disease (PD) are a consequence of pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation from standard oral levodopa therapy. Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is infused continuously via an intrajejunal percutaneous gastrostomy tube. This was the first study designed to characterize the full pharmacokinetic profiles of levodopa, carbidopa, and levodopa metabolite, 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) with 16-h LCIG infusion. Nineteen advanced PD patients (mean age, 65 years) who were on LCIG therapy for \u226530 days were enrolled. Patients received their individualized LCIG infusion doses, and serial pharmacokinetic samples were collected. Eighteen patients completed the study; 19 were assessed for safety. Mean (SD) total levodopa and carbidopa doses were 1,580 (403) and 395 (101) mg, respectively. Mean (SD) C(avg) (\u03bcg/mL) were 2.9 (0.84) for levodopa, 17.1 (4.99) for 3-OMD, and 0.22 (0.08) for carbidopa. The degree of fluctuation [defined as (C(max)-C(min))/C(avg)] in levodopa, 3-OMD, and carbidopa plasma concentrations was very low (0.52, 0.21, and 0.96, respectively) during hours 2-16 of infusion. Accordingly, the within-subject coefficients of variation in levodopa, 3-OMD, and carbidopa concentrations were low (13%, 6%, and 19%, respectively). Three patients (16%) reported \u22651 treatment-emergent adverse event; none were considered severe. Continuous intrajejunal LCIG infusion maintained stable plasma levodopa levels over 16 h. Consistent exposure has been shown to reduce motor and nonmotor complications associated with oral medications. LCIG was well tolerated, consistent with previous reports.",

    "abstract": "Small molecules that increase the presynaptic function of aminergic cells may provide neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression. Model genetic organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster may enhance the detection of new drugs via modifier or 'enhancer/suppressor' screens, but this technique has not been applied to processes relevant to psychiatry. To identify new aminergic drugs in vivo, we used a mutation in the Drosophila vesicular monoamine transporter (dVMAT) as a sensitized genetic background and performed a suppressor screen. We fed dVMAT mutant larvae \u223c 1000 known drugs and quantitated rescue (suppression) of an amine-dependent locomotor deficit in the larva. To determine which drugs might specifically potentiate neurotransmitter release, we performed an additional secondary screen for drugs that require presynaptic amine storage to rescue larval locomotion. Using additional larval locomotion and adult fertility assays, we validated that at least one compound previously used clinically as an antineoplastic agent potentiates the presynaptic function of aminergic circuits. We suggest that structurally similar agents might be used to development treatments for PD, depression and ADHD, and that modifier screens in Drosophila provide a new strategy to screen for neuropsychiatric drugs. More generally, our findings demonstrate the power of physiologically based screens for identifying bioactive agents for select neurotransmitter systems.",

    "abstract": "Dysautonomia symptoms of nutritional interest may often occur in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the role played in affecting the risk of malnutrition still needs to be clarified. A total of 208 consecutive PD outpatients hospitalised on a scheduled basis were assessed for nutritional risk by the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool. Presence of dysautonomia symptoms (dysphagia, sialorrhoea and constipation) was investigated using clinical rating scales. In our population, prevalence of nutritional risk was 17\u00b72 (95 % CI 12\u00b71, 24\u00b70) % and relied mainly on unintentional weight loss. Sialorrhoea, dysphagia, dysphagia to liquids and constipation were observed in 10\u00b76, 11\u00b70, 14\u00b74 and 59\u00b76 % of the patients, respectively. Nutritional risk was independently associated with the number of dysautonomia symptoms (OR 1\u00b739 (95 % CI 1\u00b700, 1\u00b796); P= 0\u00b7048) but not with single symptoms. An independent association was also found with the severity of motor symptoms (Hoehn-Yahr stage, OR 1\u00b748 (95 % CI 1\u00b700, 2\u00b755); P= 0\u00b7049) and levodopa dose (OR 1\u00b716 (95 % CI 1\u00b704, 1\u00b731) mg/kg per d; P= 0\u00b7009). Nutritional risk in PD outpatients appears to depend mainly on dysautonomic syndrome, disease severity and levodopa dosage. Implications for outcome deserve further investigation. The assessment of nutritional status and of gastrointestinal dysautonomia symptoms should be part of the routine work-up of a PD patient.",

    "abstract": "To examine the distributions of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) observed metabolites in Parkinson's disease (PD) throughout the whole brain.\nTwelve PD patients and 18 age-matched controls were studied using neuropsychological testing, MRI and volumetric MR spectroscopic imaging. Average values of signal normalized metabolite values for N-acetyl-aspartate, total-creatine, and total-choline (NAA, total-Cre, total-Cho, respectively) and their ratios were calculated for gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in each lobar brain region.\nAnalyses revealed altered metabolite values in PD subjects relative to controls within the GM of the temporal lobe (right: elevated Cre, P = .027; decreased NAA/Cre, P = .019; decreased Cho/Cre, P = .001 and left: decreased NAA/Cre; P = .001, decreased Cho/Cre, P = .007); the right occipital lobe (decreased NAA, P = .032 and NAA/Cre, P = .016); and the total cerebrum GM (decreased NAA/Cre, P = .029). No meaningful correlations were obtained between abnormal metabolite values and the neuropsychological measures.\nPD is associated with widespread alterations of brain metabolite concentrations, with a primary finding of increased creatine. Higher creatine values in our PD sample may reflect greater neuronal energy expenditure early in the disease process that is compensatory. This is the first whole brain MRS study of PD that has examined metabolite changes across a large fraction of the brain volume, including the cortical mantle.",

    "abstract": "Mutations of the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene have reportedly been associated with Parkinson disease (PD) in various ethnic populations such as Singaporean, Japanese, Formosan, Canadian, American, Portuguese, Greek, Brazilian, British, Italian, Ashkenazi Jewish, southern and southwestern Chinese. The purpose of this study is to determine in central China whether or not the reported GBA mutations remain associated with PD.\nIn this project, we conducted a controlled study in a cohort of 208 central Chinese PD patients and 298 controls for three known GBA mutations (L444P, N370S and R120W).\nOur data reveals a significantly higher frequency of L444P mutation in GBA gene of PD cases (3.4%) compared with the controls (0.3%) (P = 0.007, OR = 10.34, 95% CI = 1.26 - 84.71). Specifically, the frequency of L444P mutation was higher in the late onset PD (LOPD) cases compared with that in control subjects. The N370S and R120W mutations were detected in neither the PD group nor the control subjects.\nOur observations demonstrated that the GBA L444P mutation confers genetic risk for PD, especially LOPD, among the population in the central China area.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been reported to be successful in relieving the core motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and motor fluctuations in the more advanced stages of the disease. However, data on the effects of DBS on speech performance are inconsistent. While there are some series of patients documenting that speech function was relatively unaffected by DBS of the nucleus subthalamicus (STN), other investigators reported on improvements of distinct parameters of oral control and voice. Though, these ameliorations of single speech modalities were not always accompanied by an improvement of overall speech intelligibility. On the other hand, there are also indications for an induction of dysarthria as an adverse effect of STN-DBS occurring at least in some patients with PD. Since a deterioration of speech function has more often been observed under high stimulation amplitudes, this phenomenon has been ascribed to a spread of current-to-adjacent pathways which might also be the reason for the sporadic observation of an onset of dysarthria under DBS of other basal ganglia targets (e.g., globus pallidus internus/GPi or thalamus/Vim). The aim of this paper is to review and evaluate reports in the literature on the effects of DBS on speech function in PD.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation within the central nervous system has been recognized as a defining feature of neurodegenerative diseases since the early 20th century. Since that time, there has been a growing list of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson disease, which are characterized by inclusions of specific pathogenic proteins. This has led to the long-held dogma that these characteristic protein inclusions, which are composed of large insoluble fibrillar protein aggregates and visible by light microscopy, are responsible for cell death in these diseases. However, the correlation between protein inclusion formation and cytotoxicity is inconsistent, suggesting that another form of the pathogenic proteins may be contributing to neurodegeneration. There is emerging evidence implicating soluble oligomers, smaller protein aggregates not detectable by conventional microscopy, as potential culprits in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The protein \u03b1-synuclein is well recognized to contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease and is the major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. However, \u03b1-synuclein also forms oligomeric species, with certain conformations being toxic to cells. The mechanisms by which these \u03b1-synuclein oligomers cause cell death are being actively investigated, as they may provide new strategies for diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson disease and related disorders. Here we review the possible role of \u03b1-synuclein oligomers in cell death in Parkinson disease and discuss the potential clinical implications.",

    "abstract": "Neurotransmitters other than dopamine are recognized as having modulatory roles within the basal ganglia and can influence the basal ganglia dopaminergic system to alter activity of the direct and indirect pathways. Many nondopaminergic neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in the mechanisms contributing to the motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD). Thus, it is now well established that neurotransmitter systems, including glutamatergic, GABAergic, cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic, opioidergic, histaminergic, and adenosinergic systems, are affected in the pathogenesis of PD. Nondopaminergic neurotransmitter systems are thus targets for the development of novel therapies for motor symptoms and motor complications in PD. Over the last 5 years, more than 20 randomized, control trials (RCTs) in PD investigating drugs that target several of these nondopaminergic neurotransmitter systems for the treatment of motor features have been completed. There are at least 15 additional RCTs that are ongoing or planned. Here, we review these RCTs to highlight the potential nondopaminergic pharmacological therapies for treatment of motor features of PD. Nondopaminergic drugs are not expected to replace dopaminergic strategies, but further development of these drugs will likely yield novel approaches with positive clinical implications.",

    "abstract": "Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the acid beta-glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) gene, responsible for the recessive lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher's disease (GD), are the strongest known risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Our aim was to assess the contribution of GBA1 mutations in a series of early-onset PD.\nOne hundred and eighty-five PD patients (with an onset age of \u226450) and 283 age-matched controls were screened for GBA1 mutations by Sanger sequencing.\nWe show that the frequency of GBA1 mutations is much higher in this patient series than in typical late-onset patient cohorts. Furthermore, our results reveal that the most prevalent PD-associated GBA1 mutation is E326K, a variant that does not, when homozygous, cause GD.\nOur results confirm recent reports that the mutation, E326K, predisposes to PD and suggest that, in addition to reduced GBA1 activity, other molecular mechanisms may contribute to the development of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common age-related motoric neurodegenerative disease initially described in the 1800's by James Parkinson as the 'Shaking Palsy'. Loss of the neurotransmitter dopamine was recognized as underlying the pathophysiology of the motor dysfunction; subsequently discovery of dopamine replacement therapies brought substantial symptomatic benefit to PD patients. However, these therapies do not fully treat the clinical syndrome nor do they alter the natural history of this disorder motivating clinicians and researchers to further investigate the clinical phenotype, pathophysiology/pathobiology and etiology of this devastating disease. Although the exact cause of sporadic PD remains enigmatic studies of familial and rare toxicant forms of this disorder have laid the foundation for genome wide explorations and environmental studies. The combination of methodical clinical evaluation, systematic pathological studies and detailed genetic analyses have revealed that PD is a multifaceted disorder with a wide-range of clinical symptoms and pathology that include regions outside the dopamine system. One common thread in PD is the presence of intracytoplasmic inclusions that contain the protein, \u03b1-synuclein. The presence of toxic aggregated forms of \u03b1-synuclein (e.g., amyloid structures) are purported to be a harbinger of subsequent pathology. In fact, PD is both a cerebral amyloid disease and the most common synucleinopathy, that is, diseases that display accumulations of \u03b1-synuclein. Here we present our current understanding of PD etiology, pathology, clinical symptoms and therapeutic approaches with an emphasis on misfolded \u03b1-synuclein.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) can be manifested in many different ways. Although motor dysfunction represents the best characterised of the symptoms, the non-motor symptoms (NMS) of the condition can be equally disabling for people. These have been highlighted as being an issue of particular importance by people with PD. A comprehensive postal survey of members of the charity Parkinson's UK took place in 2008. This resulted in returns from 10,101 people with PD. The self-completed Non-Motor Questionnaire (NMSQuest) and quality of life scale (PDQ-8) were contained within the survey. The results showed that the percentage of people with PD experiencing NMS increased with the duration of the disease. However, people who had the younger onset form of the condition reported a greater impact of NMS, particularly in the areas of memory, depression and sleep function. There is an inverse correlation between NMS and (PDQ-8 scale). A significant number of people with PD reported that they experienced problems with olfaction, taste, nocturia and constipation prior to diagnosis and these may help to serve as a future biomarker for the condition. Although our understanding of PD-associated NMS has increased considerably in the recent past, there is still a general lack of awareness of the importance of NMS for people with PD. Further research is required to identify the best treatments that should be employed to address them.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) decreases the quality of life (QoL) of both caregivers and patients by increasing stress and burden, and it has a negative impact on their psychological state. In the present study, the authors examined the impact of PD-patient motor and non-motor clinical symptoms on the psychological health, burden, and QoL of Turkish caregivers. The study included 50 patients with PD and their caregivers. Patients' disease severity and disability, motor and non-motor symptoms, disease complications, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were assessed with various scales. Data were analyzed by multiple linear-regression models to identify variables associated with caregiver burden, psychological status, and QoL. Anxiety and depressive symptoms exhibited by the patients significantly affected the psychological state of the caregivers. Caregiver burden was increased by disease severity; the patient's degree of disability, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; and excessive daytime sleepiness. Caregiver QoL was significantly affected by the presence of dyskinesia, sialorrhea, and anxiety symptoms in patients with PD. These findings indicate that caregiving for patients with PD, particularly those in later stages, with psychiatric symptoms, affects caregiver psychological status, QoL, and caregiver burden. These results can be used to develop treatment approaches to improve caregivers' psychological status and QoL and decrease caregiver burden.",

    "abstract": "Apathy is one of the primary neuropsychiatric signatures in Parkinson's disease, yet little research has addressed the construct validity of two commonly used apathy measures, the Apathy Scale and the Lille Apathy Rating Scale. The authors tested the hypothesis that apathy is associated with reduced initiative/engaged behaviors on a laboratory-based measure of apathy. Support was found for the hypothesis that apathy, as indexed by the Apathy Scale and the Lille Apathy Rating Scale, is associated with reduced initiative/engagement on an experimental measure of apathy in Parkinson's disease patients. These findings provide independent evidence for the construct validity of self-report apathy scales, beyond clinician judgment.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine replacement with levodopa (L-DOPA) represents the mainstay of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) therapy. Nevertheless, this well established therapeutic intervention loses efficacy with the progression of the disease and patients develop invalidating side effects, known in their complex as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). Unfortunately, existing therapies fail to prevent LID and very few drugs are available to lessen its severity, thus representing a major clinical problem inPDtreatment. D2-like receptor (D2R) agonists are a powerful clinical option as an alternative to L-DOPA, especially in the early stages of the disease, being associated to a reduced risk of dyskinesia development. D2R agonists also find considerable application in the advanced stages of PD, in conjunction with L-DOPA, which is used in this context at lower dosages, to delay the appearance and the extent of the motor complications. In advanced stages of PD, D2R agonists are often effective in delaying the appearance and the extent of motor complications. Despite the great attention paid to the family of D2R agonists, the main reasons underlying the reduced risk of dyskinesia have not yet been fully characterized. Here we show that the striatal NMDA/AMPAreceptor ratio and theAMPAreceptor subunit composition are altered in experimental parkinsonism in rats. Surprisingly, while L-DOPA fails to restore these critical synaptic alterations, chronic treatment with pramipexole is associated not only with a reduced risk of dyskinesia development but is also able to rebalance, in a dose-dependent fashion, the physiological synaptic parameters, thus providing new insights into the mechanisms of dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting 1-2% in people >60 and 3-4% in people >80. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have now implicated significant evidence for association in at least 18 genomic regions. We have studied a large PD-meta analysis and identified a significant excess of SNPs (P < 1 \u00d7 10(-16)) that are associated with PD but fall short of the genome-wide significance threshold. This result was independent of variants at the 18 previously implicated regions and implies the presence of additional polygenic risk alleles. To understand how these loci increase risk of PD, we applied a pathway-based analysis, testing for biological functions that were significantly enriched for genes containing variants associated with PD. Analysing two independent GWA studies, we identified that both had a significant excess in the number of functional categories enriched for PD-associated genes (minimum P = 0.014 and P = 0.006, respectively). Moreover, 58 categories were significantly enriched for associated genes in both GWA studies (P < 0.001), implicating genes involved in the 'regulation of leucocyte/lymphocyte activity' and also 'cytokine-mediated signalling' as conferring an increased susceptibility to PD. These results were unaltered by the exclusion of all 178 genes that were present at the 18 genomic regions previously reported to be strongly associated with PD (including the HLA locus). Our findings, therefore, provide independent support to the strong association signal at the HLA locus and imply that the immune-related genetic susceptibility to PD is likely to be more widespread in the genome than previously appreciated.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of Parkinson disease using clinical and demographic data alone and when combined with information from genes associated with Parkinson disease.\nA total of 1,967 participants in the dbGAP NeuroGenetics Research Consortium data set were included. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with Parkinson disease at a genome-wide significance level in previous genome-wide association studies were included in risk prediction. Risk allele scores were calculated as the weighted count of the minor alleles. Five models were constructed. Discriminatory capability was evaluated using the area under the curve.\nBoth family history and genetic risk scores increased risk for Parkinson disease. Although the fullest model, which included both family history and genetic risk information, resulted in the highest area under the curve, there were no significant differences between models using family history alone and those using genetic information alone.\nAdding genome-wide association study-derived genotypes, family history information, or both to standard demographic risk factors for Parkinson disease resulted in an improvement in discriminatory capacity. In the full model, the contributions of genotype data and family history information to discriminatory capacity were similar, and both were statistically significant. This suggests that there is limited overlap between genetic risk factors identified through genome-wide association study and unmeasured susceptibility variants captured by family history. Our results are similar to those of studies of other complex diseases and indicate that genetic risk prediction for Parkinson disease requires identification of additional genetic risk factors and/or better methods for risk prediction in order to achieve a degree of risk prediction that is clinically useful.Genet Med 2013:15(5):361-367.",

    "abstract": "Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) performance is often compromised in Parkinson disease (PD).\nWe aimed to investigate (a) the role of working memory (WM) and information processing speed (IPS) in the WCST performance of PD without dementia and (b) the profile of PD without dementia optimal WCST performance.\n73 nondemented patients with PD were examined in WCST, WM (Digit Span Backwards [DSPANB] and Arithmetic subscale, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [WAIS]), and IPS (Digit Symbol subscale-WAIS and Trail Making Test, part A [TMT-A]) and compared to a group of 48 healthy participants. The group with PD was further divided into 2 subgroups on the basis of their WCST performance, number of categories achieved (CAT):0-2 and CAT:3-6, and comparisons were performed.\nThe DSPANB correlated significantly and was the only neuropsychological variable that significantly contributed to the WCST perseverative errors (WPERRORS) performed by the PD group. Differences in the cognitive performance between CAT:3-6 and CAT:0-2 PD subgroups were no longer significant after controlling for age and general level of intelligence (full IQ [FIQ]). Age and FIQ significantly contributed to the WPERRORS performed by CAT:3-6 PD subgroup, while DSPANB was the only variable that significantly contributed to their WCST overall performance.\nOur findings address the relationship between WM and inflexible behavior exhibited by PD without dementia, argue for the importance of lower age, higher education, and level of intelligence for the successful performance on WCST; yet, the differences in cognitive performance regardless of the duration of illness within our patients with PD provide support to cognitive reserve concept.",

    "abstract": "Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is the molecule responsible for autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease (PD), PARK8, but the etiologic effects of its mutation remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated a novel mechanism for the neurodegeneration induced by I2020T mutant LRRK2. Using native gel electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation, we found that wild-type (WT) LRRK2 formed a heterodimer with I2020T LRRK2 in transfected cells, and that the heterodimer exhibited a markedly lower intracellular protein level than the WT/WT-homodimer. An increased amount of I2020T LRRK2 decreased the protein level of co-transfected WT LRRK2. A pulse-chase experiment revealed that the intracellular protein lifetime of WT LRRK2 was shortened by co-transfection with I2020T LRRK2. These results suggest that I2020T LRRK2 enhances the intracellular degradation of WT LRRK2 through WT/I2020T-heterodimer formation. Overexpression of WT LRRK2 in HEK293 cells increased the phosphorylation level of Akt1 (S473), a possible physiological substrate of LRRK2, and made cells resistant to hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. However, both Akt1 phosphorylation and apoptosis resistance were reduced in WT/I2020T-expressing cells in comparison with WT/WT-expressing cells. Reduction of Akt1 phosphorylation and apoptosis resistance were also evident when a neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y clone overexpressing WT LRRK2 was transfected with the I2020T LRRK2. Altogether, these results suggest that the I2020T mutation enhances the intracellular degradation of LRRK2 through WT/I2020T-heterodimer formation, leading to reduced Akt1 phosphorylation and diminished protectivity against apoptosis. Our findings suggest the possibility of a dominant-negative mechanism of neurodegeneration in PD caused by I2020T LRRK2 mutation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative motor disorder, with its motor symptoms largely attributable to loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The causes of PD remain poorly understood, although environmental toxicants may play etiologic roles. Solvents are widespread neurotoxicants present in the workplace and ambient environment. Case reports of parkinsonism, including PD, have been associated with exposures to various solvents, most notably trichloroethylene (TCE). Animal toxicology studies have been conducted on various organic solvents, with some, including TCE, demonstrating potential for inducing nigral system damage. However, a confirmed animal model of solvent-induced PD has not been developed. Numerous epidemiologic studies have investigated potential links between solvents and PD, yielding mostly null or weak associations. An exception is a recent study of twins indicating possible etiologic relations with TCE and other chlorinated solvents, although findings were based on small numbers, and dose-response gradients were not observed. At present, there is no consistent evidence from either the toxicological or epidemiologic perspective that any specific solvent or class of solvents is a cause of PD. Future toxicological research that addresses mechanisms of nigral damage from TCE and its metabolites, with exposure routes and doses relevant to human exposures, is recommended. Improvements in epidemiologic research, especially with regard to quantitative characterization of long-term exposures to specific solvents, are needed to advance scientific knowledge on this topic.",

    "abstract": "The systems biology approach to complex diseases recognises that a potentially large number of biochemical network elements may be involved in disease progression, especially where positive feedback loops can be identified. Most of these network elements will be encoded by genes, for which different alleles may affect the network(s) differentially. A primary requirement is therefore to determine the relevant gene-network relationships. A corollary of this is that identification of the network should thereby allow one to 'explain' or account for any genetic associations. We apply this approach to Parkinson's disease, a disease characterised by apoptotic death of neurons of the substantia nigra, and coupled significantly to a derangement of iron metabolism. We thereby account for the involvement of various genes and biochemical pathways associated with Parkinsonism, including seemingly unconnected ones involving iron, \u03b1-synuclein, parkin, mitochondrial respiration and biology, ceramide production, lysosome biology, Lewy body formation, and so on. Although such an analysis necessarily recognises that there is no unitary 'cause' of Parkinson's, it also recognises that each of the elements contributing can or does effectively converge on a particular mode of apoptotic cell death in dopaminergic neurons, often involving iron-mediated hydroxyl radical formation. Overall, the systems biology approach allows us to propose at least one coherent synthesis of the rather disparate literature surrounding the aetiology of Parkinson's disease, and thereby to suggest some (synergistic) targets for ameliorating the disease and its progression.",

    "abstract": "Substantial evidence from both genetic and toxin induced animal and cellular models and postmortem human brain tissue indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in pathophysiology of the neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). This review discusses the emerging understanding of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction including bioenergetics defects, mitochondrial DNA mutations, familial nuclear DNA mutations, altered mitochondrial fusion/fission and morphology, mitochondrial transport/trafficking, altered transcription and increased interaction of pathogenic proteins with mitochondria in the pathogenesis of PD and HD. This review recapitulates some of the key therapeutic strategies applied to surmount mitochondrial dysfunction in these debilitating disorders. We discuss the therapeutic role of mitochondrial bioenergetic agents such as creatine, Coenzyme-Q10, mitochondrial targeted antioxidants and peptides, the SIRT1 activator resveratrol, and the pan-PPAR agonist bezafibrate in toxin and genetic cellular and animal models of PD and HD. We also summarize the phase II-III clinical trials conducted using some of these agents. Lastly, we discuss PGC-1\u03b1, TORC and Sirtuins as potential therapeutic targets for mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Mitochondrial function and dysfunction in neurodegeneration'.",

    "abstract": "Gait and balance disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD) can be debilitating and may lead to increased fall risk. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment option once therapeutic benefits from medication are limited due to motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. Optimizing DBS parameters for gait and balance can be significantly more challenging than for other PD motor symptoms. Furthermore, inter-rater reliability of the standard clinical PD assessment scale, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), may introduce bias and washout important features of gait and balance that may respond differently to PD therapies. Study objectives were to evaluate clinician UPDRS gait and balance scoring inter-rater reliability, UPDRS sensitivity to different aspects of gait and balance, and how kinematic features extracted from motion sensor data respond to stimulation. Forty-two subjects diagnosed with PD were recruited with varying degrees of gait and balance impairment. All subjects had been prescribed dopaminergic medication, and 20 subjects had previously undergone DBS surgery. Subjects performed seven items of the gait and balance subset of the UPDRS while wearing motion sensors on the sternum and each heel and thigh. Inter-rater reliability varied by UPDRS item. Correlation coefficients between at least one kinematic feature and corresponding UPDRS scores were greater than 0.75 for six of the seven items. Kinematic features improved (p<0.05) from DBS-OFF to DBS-ON for three UPDRS items. Despite achieving high correlations with the UPDRS, evaluating individual kinematic features may help address inter-rater reliability issues and rater bias associated with focusing on different aspects of a motor task.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait is a paroxysmal and disabling symptom that commonly affects patients in the latter stages of Parkinson's disease, however the intermittent nature of this symptom makes it difficult to study in the clinical setting. Our research group has previously reported a correlation between self-reported freezing of gait symptoms and performance on a seated virtual reality gait task. In this study, we sought to determine whether behavioral measures recorded on this task were correlated with actual clinical measures of freezing of gait recorded in a cohort of 38 Parkinson's disease patients whilst in their clinically defined 'off' state. Firstly, patients with freezing of gait had a significantly larger frequency of spontaneous motor arrests recorded on the virtual reality gait task than 'non-freezers'. In addition, in those 24 patients with clinically proven freezing of gait, the number and percentage of time spent with freezing on the virtual reality task were both moderately correlated with the duration of freezing of gait recorded on the timed up-and-go tasks. These findings suggest that the freezing behavior observed during a virtual reality gait task may share similar neural substrates to freezing of gait. Such a relationship could offer a potential avenue for modeling the phenomenon of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease, allowing for the exploration of the neural correlates of freezing.",

    "abstract": "To explore current status and choices regarding diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) among physicians, general neurologists and movement disorders specialists in China via a national survey.\nThe cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted from November, 2010 to July, 2011. Six hundreds and twelve doctors from different cities in China were recruited for this study.\n68.6% (n=420) and 23.9% (n=146) of doctors have read the national and international guidelines, respectively. There was a larger proportion of movement disorders specialists reading the guidelines, in contrast to physicians and general neurologists (P<0.001). Up to 76.4% (n=465) and 81.8% (n=498) of doctors would choose standard oral levodopa test and conventional MRI(with T1 and T2), respectively; Whereas susceptibility weighed imaging(SWI)(16.1%; n=98), transcranial sonography (TCS) (1.8%; n=11) and functional neuroimaging test, such as single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT) (10.2%; n=62) and positron emission tomography(PET)(13.3%; n=81) were less used for suspected patients with PD in clinical practice. Doctors at different levels or from different hospitals and cities would choose different medication for motor complications and non-motor symptoms of patients with PD, in addition to initial drug selection for newly diagnosed PD. Doctors who had read the guidelines had significantly better knowledge of medication selections for PD under specific circumstances.\nCompared with commonly employed standard oral levodopa test and conventional MRI, SWI complements MRI, TCS and functional neuroimaging were less performed for diagnosis of PD in clinical practice in China. The choices of diagnostic methods and therapeutic strategy of PD vary among physicians, general neurologists and movement disorders specialists. Guideline awareness is markedly beneficial to reasonable PD medications strategy in China.",

    "abstract": "The side of motor symptom predominance may influence cognitive performance in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD): PD patients with right-side motor symptom predominance typically present difficulties in tasks of language and verbal memory, whereas PD patients with left-side motor symptom predominance typically present difficulties in visuospatial tasks. The current study aimed at investigating the relationship between motor symptom lateralization and cognitive performance in PD patients without the possible confounding effect of dopaminergic drugs, which may enhance or impair cognition on the basis of assessed function and disease stage. From the initial sample of 137 consecutive newly diagnosed drug-na\u00efve (de novo) PD patients, clinical follow-ups and neurological examinations identified 108 right-handed patients with a unilateral motor presentation or a clear motor asymmetry (59 right-PD: 54.6%; 49 left-PD: 45.4%). Any cognitive difference emerged between right-PD patients and left-PD patients at this disease stage. Scores of lateralized motor impairment severity correlated with some cognitive performances: Right motor impairment correlated with a measure of set shifting (Trail Making Test B-A), and left motor impairment correlated with phonemic fluency and tasks with visuospatial material (Colored Progressive Matrices of Raven, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Copy and Immediate Recall). Findings of the current study supported the conclusion that the side of clinical motor predominance scarcely influences cognition in the early untreated stages of PD, suggesting that cognitive differences between subgroups of lateralized PD patients probably may appear in more advanced disease stages.",

    "abstract": "TRPV1 receptors and cannabinoid system are considered as important modulators of basal ganglia functions, and their pharmacologic manipulation represents a promising therapy to alleviate Parkinson-induced hypokinesia. Recent evidence suggests that the blockade of cannabinoid receptors might be beneficial to alleviate motor deficits observed in Parkinson's disease. In the present study, we have evaluated the effects of AMG9810 , a selective antagonist of TRPV1 receptors, on the motor and cognitive functions in a rat model of Parkinson's disease generated by an intracerebroventricular injection of 6- hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (200 \u03bcg per animal). The injection of 10 nmol of AMG9810 for a single dose (AMG1) and for 2 weeks (AMG14) partially attenuated the hypokinesia shown by these animals in motor function evaluation tests, whereas chronic administration of AMG had destructive effects on learning and memory in 6-OHDA-treated rats. Animals in the AMG 1 and AMG 14 groups showed an increased latency to fall in rotarod and grasping tests in each trials compared with 6-OHDA-treated rats (P < 0.01) and DMSO 1 and 14 groups (P < 0.05). Our data indicate that pharmacological blockade of TRPV1 receptors by AMG 9810 attenuates the hypokinetic effects of 6-OHDA and that TRPV1 receptors play an important role in 6-OHDA-induced hypokinesia, although elucidation of the neurochemical substrate involved in this process remains a major challenge for the future.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. We aimed to determine whether gait velocity is as useful as a balance test, a self-report measure of freezing of gait (FOG), and/or a measure of motor symptom severity for predicting falls among people with Parkinson Disease (PD). Methods. Fifty-six individuals with idiopathic PD completed a baseline assessment consisting of these measures: (1) MDS-UPDRS III, (2) Mini-BESTest, (3) gait velocity (forward, backward, dual task, and fast), and (4) FOGQ. Retrospective fall history was collected at baseline and six months later. Participants were considered fallers if they had two or more falls in the surveillance period. Ability of the tests to discriminate between fallers and nonfallers was determined using ROC curves followed by pairwise statistical noninferiority comparisons (P = .05) of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for each test. Results. At six months, 22% (n = 21) of the sample were fallers. Fallers differed significantly from nonfallers on the MDS-UPDRS III, Mini-BESTest, backward gait velocity, and FOGQ. The Mini-BESTest had the highest AUC and was superior to all gait velocity measures at identifying fallers. Conclusion. A single measure of gait velocity, even in a challenging condition, may not be as effective as the Mini-BESTest in identifying fallers among people with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has become a major health problem affecting 1.5% of the world's population over 65 years of age. As life expectancy has increased so has the occurrence of PD. The primary direct consequence of this disease is the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum. As the intensity of motor dysfunction increases, the symptomatic triad of bradykinesia, tremors-at-rest, and rigidity occur. Progressive neurodegeneration may also impact non-DA neurotransmitter systems including cholinergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic, often leading to the development of depression, sleep disturbances, dementia, and autonomic nervous system failure. L-DOPA is the most efficacious oral delivery treatment for controlling motor symptoms; however, this approach is ineffective regarding nonmotor symptoms. New treatment strategies are needed designed to provide neuroprotection and encourage neurogenesis and synaptogenesis to slow or reverse this disease process. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met receptor system is a member of the growth factor family and has been shown to protect against degeneration of DA neurons in animal models. Recently, small angiotensin-based blood-brain barrier penetrant mimetics have been developed that activate this HGF/c-Met system. These compounds may offer a new and novel approach to the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Motor Cortex Stimulation (MCS) is less efficacious than Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease. However, it might be proposed to patients excluded from DBS or unresponsive to DBS. Ten patients with advanced PD underwent unilateral MCS contralaterally to the worst clinical side. A plate electrode was positioned over the motor cortex in the epidural space through single burr hole after identification of the area with neuronavigation and neurophysiological tests. Clinical assessment was performed by total UPDRS, UPDRS III total, UPDRS III-items 27-31, UPDRS IV, and UPDRS II before implantation in off-medication and on-medication states and after surgery at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months in on-medication/on-stimulation and off-medication/on-stimulation states. We assessed changes of quality of life, throughout the Parkinson's disease quality of life scale (PDQoL-39), and the dose of anti-Parkinson's disease medications, throughout the Ldopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD). During off-medication state, we observed moderate and transitory reduction of total UPDRS and UPDRS total scores and significant and long-lasting improvement in UPDRS III items 27-31 score for axial symptoms. There was marked reduction of UPDRS IV score and LEDD. PDQL-39 improvement was also significant. No important complications and adverse events occurred.",

    "abstract": "Fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon is a common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases but little is known about the causes of this alteration. In Parkinson's disease, it is believed to be the consequence of an ER-Golgi transport imbalance and/or of cytoskeleton alterations. In the present study, we analyze the mechanisms involved in Golgi fragmentation in differentiated PC12 cells treated with 6-hydroxydopamine or methamphetamine as cellular models of Parkinson's disease. Our data demonstrate that Golgi fragmentation precedes and might trigger the aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein and the formation of inclusions, alterations in anterograde and retrograde transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, and cytoskeleton damage. In contrast, fragmentation is directly related with alterations in the levels of Rab1, 2 and 8 and the SNARE protein syntaxin 5. Thus, overexpression of Rab1 and 8 and depletion of Rab2 and syntaxin 5 rescue the Golgi morphology. In conclusion, the homeostasis of a limited number of Rab and SNARE proteins is important for understanding the cytopathology of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "There are considerable differences in cognition between individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) which might be explained by the theory of cognitive reserve. This theory states that premorbid factors, such as high intellectual capacities, provide a buffer against cognitive impairments. This study determines whether cognitive reserve influences cognition in PD. Forty-eight PD patients were included. All were assessed with two proxies of cognitive reserve, tests of cognition and both measures of disease characteristic and symptoms of depression. After accounting for age, gender, disease characteristics and depression, cognitive reserve was an independent predictor of cognitive performance. In conclusion, cognitive reserve influences cognition in PD, i.e. PD patients with a high premorbid intellectual ability show fewer cognitive impairments than patients with a low premorbid ability. This indicates that cognitive reserve needs to be taken into account when monitoring the evolution of cognition in PD, however, verification of results on a larger patient sample would be desirable.",

    "abstract": "To elucidate the dynamic effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) during activity on the dopaminergic system, 12 PD patients who had STN-DBS operations at least 1 month prior, underwent two positron emission tomography scans during right-foot movement in DBS-off and DBS-on conditions. To quantify motor performance changes, the motion speed and mobility angle of the foot at the ankle were measured twice. Estimations of the binding potential of [(11)C]raclopride (BP(ND)) were based on the Logan plot method. Significant motor recovery was found in the DBS-on condition. The STN-DBS during exercise significantly reduced the [(11)C]raclopride BP(ND) in the caudate and the nucleus accumbens (NA), but not in the dorsal or ventral putamen. The magnitude of dopamine release in the NA correlated negatively with the magnitude of motor load, indicating that STN-DBS facilitated motor behavior more smoothly and at less expense to dopamine neurons in the region. The lack of dopamine release in the putamen and the significant dopamine release in the ventromedial striatum by STN-DBS during exercise indicated dopaminergic activation occurring in the motivational circuit during action, suggesting a compensatory functional activation of the motor loop from the nonmotor to the motor loop system.",

    "abstract": "More than 1 million people in the United States have Parkinson disease (PD), more than are diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, and myasthenia gravis combined. PD affects approximately 1 in 100 Americans older than 60 years. It burdens patients, their care partners, and the overall healthcare system. This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical features, putative environmental risk and protective factors, neuropathological aspects, heterogeneity, medical management, and recent studies regarding genetics and PD. The article suggests that based on new research, the prevalence of PD varies in different regions of the United States. Some progress has been made in identifying the risk and protective factors of PD, and a newly emphasized area of study in PD is genetics. Patient care recommendations, based on American Academy of Neurology practice guidelines, are outlined to show the state of contemporary medical management of PD and related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease psychosis is a frequent and serious complication of advanced disease, but few disease-specific outcome measures exist.\nUsing baseline scores from 4 clinical trials, we identified relevant items that assessed Parkinson's disease psychosis to create a shortened version of the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms. We then analyzed the validity and treatment sensitivity of the shortened scale. Principal component analyses evaluated the underlying structure. Scores were compared across age, gender, trial, cognition, and country of origin. Sensitivity to change was assessed by comparing change in psychosis scores to the clinical global impression of improvement score, and effect sizes were calculated to evaluate treatment response.\nNine items were selected based on face-validity and symptom frequency. Principal component analysis yielded a 4-factor structure and identified delusions and visual, auditory, and somatic hallucinations as distinct constructs. Baseline total scores were similar across study, gender, region, and age group. The clinically meaningful change in the shortened scale, defined as a 1-unit change in clinical global impression, was 2.33 points, and the effect size was -0.722. The change in scores did not significantly differ between those with cognitive impairment and those without.\nThe shortened Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms for Parkinson's disease retains the reliability, sensitivity to change, and effect size of the larger scale while reducing administration time and, more importantly, score variability. The scale is an effective outcome measure for use in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The second most serious neurodegenerative disease is Parkinson's disease (PD). Over the past several decades, a strong body of evidence suggests that PD can begin years before the hallmark clinical motor symptoms appear. Biomarkers for PD are urgently needed to differentiate between neurodegenerative disorders, screen novel therapeutics, and predict eventual clinical PD before the onset of symptoms. Some clinical evaluations and neuroimaging techniques have been developed in the last several years with some success in this area. Moreover, other strategies have been utilized to identify biochemical and genetic markers associated with PD leading to the examination of PD progression and pathogenesis in cerebrospinal fluid, blood, or saliva. Finally, interesting results are surfacing from preliminary studies using known PD-associated genetic mutations to assess potential premotor PD biomarkers. The current review highlights recent advances and underscores areas of potential advancement.",

    "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are both common neurological disorders. There has been much debate over whether an etiological link between these two diseases exists and whether they share a common pathophysiology. Evidence pointing towards a link includes response to dopaminergic agents in PD and RLS, suggestive of underlying dopamine dysfunction in both conditions. The extrastriatal dopaminergic system, in particular altered spinal dopaminergic modulation, may be variably involved in PD patients with RLS symptoms. In addition, there is now evidence that the nigrostriatal system, primarily involved in PD, is also affected in RLS. Furthermore, an association of RLS with the parkin mutation has been suggested. The prevalence of RLS has also been reported to be increased in other disorders of dopamine regulation. However, clinical association studies and functional imaging have produced mixed findings. Conflicting accounts of emergence of RLS and improvement in RLS symptoms after deep brain stimulation (DBS) also contribute to the uncertainty surrounding the issue. Among the strongest arguments against a common pathophysiology is the role of iron in RLS and PD. While elevated iron levels in the substantia nigra contribute to oxidative stress in PD, RLS is a disorder of relative iron deficiency, with symptoms responding to replacement therapy. Recent ultrasonography studies have suggested that, despite overlapping clinical features, the mechanisms underlying idiopathic RLS and RLS associated with PD may differ. In this review, we provide a concise summary of the clinical, imaging and genetic evidence exploring the link between RLS and PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson`s disease (PD) is a progressive, disabling neurodegenerative disorder with onset of motor and non-motor features. Both reduce quality of life of PD patients and cause caregiver burden. This review aims to provide a survey of possible therapeutic options for treatment of motor and non motor symptoms of PD and to discuss their relation to each other. MAO-B-Inhibitors, NMDA antagonists, dopamine agonists and levodopa with its various application modes mainly improve the dopamine associated motor symptoms in PD. This armentarium of PD drugs only partially influences the onset and occurrence of non motor symptoms. These PD features predominantly result from non dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Autonomic features, such as seborrhea, hyperhidrosis, orthostatic syndrome, salivation, bladder dysfunction, gastrointestinal disturbances, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression, sleep disorders, psychosis, cognitive dysfunction with impaired execution and impulse control may appear. Drug therapy of these non motor symptoms complicates long-term PD drug therapy due to possible occurrence of drug interactions, - side effects, and altered pharmacokinetic behaviour of applied compounds. Dopamine substituting compounds themselves may contribute to onset of these non motor symptoms. This complicates the differentiation from the disease process itself and influences therapeutic options, which are often limited because of additional morbidity with necessary concomitant drug therapy.",

    "abstract": "Tissue concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) are markedly decreased in various regions of the Parkinson's disease (PD) brain. As in the substantia nigra pars compacta, neuronal dropout and Lewy bodies are prominent changes affecting the locus coeruleus, which is the source of ascending NErgic projections. Despite the major roles of NE throughout the brain, there has been only minimal exploration of pharmacological intervention with NErgic neurotransmission. Cognitive operations, \"freezing\" of gait, tremor, dyskinesia, REM sleep regulation, and other aspects of brain function are tied into signaling by NE, and there is also evidence that it may have a role in the neurodegenerative process itself.

    "abstract": "This review gives a brief insight into the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the converging pathogenic processes involved in Parkinson's disease (PD). Mitochondria provide cellular energy in the form of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation, but as an integral part of this process, superoxides and other reactive oxygen species are also produced. Excessive free radical production contributes to oxidative stress. Cells have evolved to handle such stress via various endogenous anti-oxidant proteins. One such family of proteins is the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs), which are anion carriers located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. There are five known homologues (UCP1 to 5), of which UCP4 and 5 are predominantly expressed in neural cells. In a series of previous publications, we have shown how these neuronal UCPs respond to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+; toxic metabolite of MPTP) and dopamine-induced toxicity to alleviate neuronal cell death by preserving ATP levels and mitochondrial membrane potential, and reducing oxidative stress. We also showed how their expression can be influenced by nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway specifically in UCP4. Furthermore, we previously reported an interesting link between PD and metabolic processes through the protective effects of leptin (hormone produced by adipocytes) acting via UCP2 against MPP+-induced toxicity. There is increasing evidence that these endogenous neuronal UCPs can play a vital role to protect neurons against various pathogenic stresses including those associated with PD. Their expression, which can be induced, may well be a potential therapeutic target for various drugs to alleviate the harmful effects of pathogenic processes in PD and hence modify the progression of this disease.",

    "abstract": "The A53T mutation in the \u03b1-synuclein gene causes autosomal-dominant Lewy body Parkinson's disease (PD). Cultured cell models have linked this mutation to increased cell macroautophagy, although evidence of enhanced macroautophagy in patients with this mutation has not been assessed.\nTo determine whether macroautophagy is increased by the A53T \u03b1-synuclein gene mutation in PD patients and cell models.\nFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 10 \u03bcm-thick tissue sections from the substantia nigra and anterior cingulate cortex of two PD patients with the A53T \u03b1-synuclein gene mutation were compared with four sporadic PD cases and four controls obtained from the Sydney Brain Bank. Lewy bodies were isolated from frontal cortex of a case with late stage PD (recruited from South Australian Brain Bank). Immunohistochemistry was performed for \u03b1-synuclein and the macroautophagy markers autophagy-specific gene (ATG) 5, ATG6/Beclin1 and ATG8/LC3. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with wild type or A53T mutant \u03b1-synuclein plasmids and observable changes in macroautophagy marker protein levels assessed using Western blotting.\n\u03b1-Synuclein immunoreactive neurites and dots were more numerous in patients with A53T mutations compared with late stage sporadic PD patients, and perinuclear cytoplasmic \u03b1-synuclein aggregates were observed in the \u03b1-synuclein A53T gene transfected SH-SY5Y cells compared to wild type transfections. All PD patients (with or without A53T mutations) had increased immunohistochemical evidence for macroautophagy compared with controls, and the levels of the ATG5 complex were equally increased in wild type and A53T \u03b1-synuclein gene transfected cells compared to controls.\nDespite increased \u03b1-synuclein accumulation with A53T mutations, macroautophagy is not increased above that observed in sporadic patients with PD or in cells transfected with wild type \u03b1-synuclein, suggesting that mutated \u03b1-synuclein protein is not removed by macroautophagy.",

    "abstract": "The presence and extent of structural changes in the brain as a consequence of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still poorly understood.\nHigh-resolution 3-tesla T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance images in sixty-five PD and 27 age-matched healthy control participants were examined. Putamen, caudate, and intracranial volumes were manually traced in the axial plane of 3D reconstructed images. Striatal nuclei volumes were normalized to intracranial volume for statistical comparison. Disease status was assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and Hoehn and Yahr scale. Cognitive status was assessed using global status tests and detailed neuropsychological testing.\nBoth caudate and putamen volumes were smaller in PD brains compared to controls after adjusting for age and gender. Caudate volumes were reduced by 11% (p\u2009=\u20090.001) and putamen volumes by 8.1% (p\u2009=\u20090.025). PD striatal volumes were not found to be significantly correlated with cognitive or motor decline.\nSmall, but significant reductions in the volume of both the caudate and putamen occur in PD brains. These reductions are independent of the effects of age and gender, however the relation of these reductions to the functional loss of dopamine, which is characteristic of PD, remains unclear.",

    "abstract": "Curcumin,a natural polyphenol obtained from turmeric,has been implicated to be neuroprotective in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders although the mechanism remains poorly understood. The results of our recent experiments indicated that curcumin could protect dopaminergic neurons from apoptosis in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD). The death of dopaminergic neurons and the loss of dopaminergic axon in the striatum were significantly suppressed by curcumin in MPTP mouse model. Further studies showed that curcumin inhibited JNKs hyperphosphorylation induced by MPTP treatment. JNKs phosphorylation can cause translocation of Bax to mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c which both ultimately contribute to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. These pro-apoptosis effect can be diminished by curcumin. Our experiments demonstrated that curcumin can prevent nigrostriatal degeneration by inhibiting the dysfunction of mitochondrial through suppressing hyperphosphorylation of JNKs induced by MPTP. Our results suggested that JNKs/mitochondria pathway may be a novel target in the treatment of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "A rat model of Parkinson's disease was established by 6-hydroxydopamine injection into the medial forebrain bundle. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were isolated from the femur and tibia, and were co-cultured with 10% and 60% lesioned or intact striatal extracts. The results showed that when exposed to lesioned striatal extracts, BMSCs developed bipolar or multi-polar morphologies, and there was an increase in the percentage of cells that expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), nestin and neuron-specific enolase (NSE). Moreover, the percentage of NSE-positive cells increased with increasing concentrations of lesioned striatal extracts. However, intact striatal extracts only increased the percentage of GFAP-positive cells. The findings suggest that striatal extracts from Parkinson's disease rats induce BMSCs to differentiate into neuronal-like cells in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Evidence from carefully conducted open label clinical trials suggested that therapeutic benefit can be achieved by grafting fetal dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons derived from ventral mesencephalon (VM) into the denervated striatum of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, two double-blind trials generated negative results reporting deleterious side effects such as prominent dyskinesias. Heterogeneous composition of VM grafts is likely to account for suboptimal clinical efficacy.We consider that gene expression patterns of the VM tissue needs to be better understood by comparing the genetic signature of the surviving and functioning grafts with the cell suspensions used for transplantation. In addition, it is crucial to assess whether the grafted cells exhibit the DAergic phenotype of adult substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). To investigate this further, we used a GFP reporter mouse as source of VM tissue that enabled the detection and dissection of the grafts 6 weeks post implantation. A comparative gene expression analysis of the VM cell suspension and grafts revealed that VM grafts continue to differentiate post-implantation. In addition, implanted grafts showed a mature SNpc-like molecular DAergic phenotype with similar expression levels of TH, Vmat2 and Dat. However, by comparing gene expression of the adult SNpc with dissected grafts we detected a higher expression of progenitor markers in the grafts. Finally, when compared to the VM cell suspension, post-grafting there was a higher expression of markers inherent to glia and other neuronal populations.In summary, our data highlight the dynamic development of distinctive DAergic and non-DAergic gene expression markers associated with the maturation of VM grafts in vivo. The molecular signature of VM grafts and its functional relevance should be further explored in future studies aimed at the optimization of DAergic cell therapy approaches in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease is a progressive neurological condition characterized by slowness and paucity of movement (bradykinesia), muscle rigidity, resting tremors, and disordered posture. The onset is typically in the 6th or 7th decade of life with slow progression to akinesia, severe tremors, physical disability and death within 10 to 25 years of initial symptoms. Parkinson disease is common and affects approximately 1% of Americans above the age of 60 years. The cause of Parkinson disease is unknown, but is marked by loss of dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the brainstem and loss of normal dopaminergic neurotransmission. Therapy of Parkinson disease continues to evolve and has resulted in improved quality of life and survival. The initial agents used for Parkinson disease were anticholinergic agents including trihexyphenidyl (Artane, Trihexy: 1949), benztropine (Cogentin: 1954), and biperiden (Akineton: 1959); their mechanism of action in Parkinsonism is not completely clear. With the increased understanding of the role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of Parkinsonism, agents that directly or indirectly affect dopaminergic transmission have been developed that have resulted in marked improvements in the management of symptoms of Parkinson disease. Levodopa (L-DOPA: 1970) is a metabolic precursor of dopamine and is the single most effective agent for Parkinson disease. It is usually combined with carbidopa (Sinemet: 1975), which increases the drug levels and half life of levodopa by inhibiting the amino acid decarboxylase that metabolizes levodopa peripherally. Dopaminergic receptor agonists are also beneficial in Parkinson disease and are often combined with levodopa/carbidopa. Dopamine receptor agonists currently available include bromocriptine (1978: Parlodel), pergolide (Permax: 1988), apomorphine (Apokyn: 2004) and more selective agonists for the D2 class of dopamine receptors \u2013 ropinirole (Requip: 1997), pramipexole (Mirapex: 1997) and rotigotine (Neupro which is formulated in a transdermal patch: 2007). More recently, inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) have been developed that block the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of dopamine; these agents include tolcapone (Tasmar: 1998), entacapone (Comtan: 2003), and opicapone (Ongentys: 2020). Dopamine is also metabolized by the monoamine oxidases and selegiline (Atapryl: 2006) and rasagiline (Azilect: 2007), which are specific inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B and are used as adjunctive therapy with levodopa in the management of Parkinson disease. Amantadine (Symmetrel: 1987) also has activity in Parkinson disease, perhaps through stimulation of release of dopamine in the substantial nigra. It is discussed separately as an anti-influenza agent. Istradefylline (Nourianz: 2019) is a new class of anti-Parkinson agents that is an antagonist of the adenosine 2A (A",

    "abstract": "Restorative/protective therapies to restore dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) are greatly needed to effectively change the debilitating course of Parkinson's disease. In this study, we tested the therapeutic potential of a neurogenic neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, in the restoration of the components of the nigrostriatal pathway in MPTP-lesioned mice by measuring striatal dopamine levels, total and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neuron numbers and BrdU-positive cells in the SNpc. An acute treatment (once/week for two weeks) with allopregnanolone restored the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive and total cell numbers in the SNpc of MPTP-lesioned mice, even though this did not increase striatal dopamine. It was also noted that MPTP treated mice to which allopregnanolone was administered had an increase in BrdU-positive cells in the SNpc. The effects of allopregnanolone in MPTP-lesioned mice were more apparent in mice that underwent behavioral tests. Interestingly, mice treated with allopregnanolone after MPTP lesion were able to perform at levels similar to that of non-lesioned control mice in a rotarod test. These data demonstrate that allopregnanolone promotes the restoration of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons and total cells in the nigrostriatal tract, improves the motor performance in MPTP-treated mice, and may serve as a therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disease, has been traditionally defined by its characteristic motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms, including mood disorder, psychosis, sleep disturbance, autonomic dysfunction, and cognitive impairment, have being recently recognized as symptoms of PD. Cognitive impairment or dementia is one of the critical symptoms during the advanced stages of PD and is associated with increased disability and reduced quality of life of both patients and caregivers. The point prevalence of dementia in PD is about 30%, and its incidence rate in PD patients is 4-6 times higher than that in age-matched controls. The term mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been adopted to describe the potential prodromal stage of dementia in PD, which has been gaining increasing attention. Several studies have reported the clinical features, epidemiology, biomarkers, and neuropathology of MCI in PD; however, neither the precise definitions nor the employed criteria were consistent across these studies. Recently, the Movement Disorder Society Task Force proposed new diagnostic criteria for MCI in PD to allow clinicians to identify PD patients with increased risk of dementia. Further studies are needed to validate the proposed criteria in daily clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The surgical lesion of different brain structures has been used as a treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) for several decades. More recently, the favored therapeutic approach has involved the administration of levodopa and the use of DBS. These two major therapeutic advances have greatly modified both the clinical condition of patients and the history of the disease. With the introduction of L-dopa in 1967, patients could regain mobility, because their akinesia, tremor, and rigidity were greatly improved, with consequent significant improvement in quality of life and increased life expectancy. However, after the so-called \"honeymoon\" period in which the disease seemed to be controlled, motor fluctuations and L-dopa-induced dyskinesias mitigated the initial enthusiasm. In the 1990s, unilateral pallidotomy and DBS of the globus palllidus internus and STN reduced these motor fluctuations and dyskinesias remarkably, thereby inaugurating a new era in the surgical treatment of PD. Short- and medium-term follow-up studies of patients who underwent surgery have documented sustained, significant motor benefits. However, given the progressive nature of PD and the purely symptomatic effects of pallidotomy and DBS, the long-term clinical evolution of these surgical patients currently seems to be associated with a new PD phenotype, mainly characterized by axial motor problems and cognitive impairment. Here, we analyze the long-term clinical outcomes of surgical PD patients with at least 5-year follow-up, focusing on the long-term motor symptoms that were initially responsive to surgery.",

    "abstract": "Frontal subcortical cognitive defects are predominant in Parkinson's disease (PD). Temporal lobe dysfunction seems more relevant for progression to dementia. We aimed to study the relative importance of temporal lobe defects versus executive impairment in the progression to dementia in PD by using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). The (1)H-MRS features of PD patients with intact cognition (PD-CgInt; n = 16), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 15) and dementia (PDD; n = 15) were compared, to delineate the metabolic alterations correlating with cognitive status. Metabolite concentrations were acquired from voxels localized to the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC). Cognitive status was established following the Movement Disorder Society PDD criteria, administering the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale. The Parkinson's Disease Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS) was used to correlate (1)H-MRS with neuropsychology. N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentrations in the right DL-PFC were decreased in PD-MCI compared with PD-CgInt patients (p = 0.002), and correlated with frontal subcortical tasks. Decreased NAA concentrations in the left hippocampus in PDD compared to PD-MCI (p = 0.03) correlated with confrontation naming. The present findings support that executive impairment is related to dorsolateral prefrontal dysfunction from the early stages, while progression to dementia is linked to the additional impairment of temporal lobe structures. The PD-CRS was able to capture the differential impairment of prefrontal versus temporal cortical areas.",

    "abstract": "Open-label extensions [studies SP516 (NCT00501969) and SP715 (NCT00594386)] of the CLEOPATRA-PD and PREFER studies were conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the dopaminergic agonist, rotigotine, over several years of follow-up in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Eligible subjects completing the double-blind trials received open-label adjunctive rotigotine (\u226416\u00a0mg/24\u00a0h) for up to 4 and 6\u00a0years in Studies SP516 and SP715, respectively. Safety and tolerability were assessed using adverse events, vital signs and laboratory parameters, and efficacy assessed using the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS). Of the 395 and 258 patients enrolled in the SP516 and SP715 studies, 48 and 45\u00a0% completed, respectively. Adverse events were typically dopaminergic effects [e.g., somnolence (18-25\u00a0%/patient-year), insomnia (5-7\u00a0%/patient-year), dyskinesias (4-8\u00a0%/patient-year) and hallucinations (4-8\u00a0%/patient-year)], or related to the transdermal application of a patch (application site reactions: 14-15\u00a0%/patient-year). There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs or laboratory parameters in either study. Mean UPDRS part II (activities of daily living) and part III (motor function) total scores improved from double-blind baseline during dose titration, then gradually declined over the maintenance period. In study SP516, mean UPDRS part II and III total scores were 0.8 points above and 2.8 points below double-blind baseline, respectively, at end of treatment. In study SP715, mean UPDRS part II and III total scores were 4.1 points above and 0.2 points below baseline, respectively, at end of treatment. In these open-label studies, adjunctive rotigotine was efficacious with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in patients with advanced PD for up to 6\u00a0years.",

    "abstract": "Pain occurring in Parkinson's disease (PD) may affect a large proportion of patients. Based on the results of the methodologically more robust case-control studies that detected a significantly greater frequency of pain in PD patients than in control subjects, pain should now be considered as a non-motor symptom of PD. The heterogeneous quality of pain, the variable relationship of pain with parkinsonian motor signs, and the mixed response of pain to dopaminergic drugs suggest complex mechanisms for pain in PD. Some evidence raises the possibility of common mechanisms shared by pain patients, regardless of the clinical heterogeneity of pain and its variable relationship with motor signs.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been suspected to play a key role in neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. PINK1 and Parkin, the products of two genes responsible for autosomal recessive Parkinsonian syndromes with early onset, act as a quality control system on the outer mitochondrial membrane to preserve mitochondrial integrity. While doing so, they interact with multiple molecular actors in processes regulating mitochondrial biology and cell survival. The physiological conditions that mobilize these processes in neurons, and the mechanisms underlying their integration and spatiotemporal coordination, remain to be elucidated. Understanding how dysfunction of these house-keeping pathways leads to the preferential degeneration of a specific neuronal population in Parkinson's disease is a major challenge for future research.",

    "abstract": "Despite evidence suggesting that patient attitudes towards therapy may influence treatment outcomes, the impact of these factors on treatment for Parkinson's disease is poorly understood. These two surveys, based in Japan and the US, investigated the attitudes of patients towards antiparkinsonian medications, the complications of these therapies, and how these differ across geographies.\nThe US PRELUDE survey collected data from May 13 to May 20, 2003, from 300 interviews with patients with Parkinson's disease from the National Parkinson Foundation. The Japanese survey was carried out from June to December 2008 in a stepwise manner using questionnaires (n = 3548) followed by interviews with those who had consented to participate in the questionnaire (n = 407). Both surveys assessed the attitudes of patients towards therapies for Parkinson's disease and associated complications.\nDyskinesia was not a major challenge of therapy for Parkinson's disease, and wearing-off caused greater concern in the US, while hallucinations had a greater emphasis in Japan. Patients who had previously experienced dyskinesia were less concerned about this side effect than those who had not. Although pill burden was thought to be a concern in the US, Japanese patients did not indicate that pill burden would limit their drug intake. There were also discrepancies between the perspectives and concerns of patients and those of their treating physicians.\nRecognizing patient perspectives regarding therapies for Parkinson's disease and associated complications, as well as certain cultural influences, is important in the management of parkinsonian symptoms. Acknowledging these concerns may improve the standard of care in patients with Parkinson's disease. In addition, improved patient education and effective patient-physician communication in both countries may improve compliance and treatment outcomes in patients with the disease.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disorders are frequent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD), probably due to multifactorial pathogeneses including disease progression, dopaminergic drugs, or concomitant illness. In recent years, the pedunculopontine tegmental (PPTg) nucleus has been considered a surgical target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in advanced PD patients. As it is involved in controlling the sleep-wake cycle, we investigated the long-lasting effects of PPTg-DBS on the sleep of five PD patients implanted in both the PPTg and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) by rating two subjective clinical scales for sleep: the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).\nSleep scales were administered a week before surgery (T0), three months after DBS (T1), and one year later (T2). In this study, STN-DBS was kept constantly in ON, and three different patterns of PPTg-DBS were investigated: STN-ON (PPTg switched off); PPTg-ON (PPTg stimulated 24 h/day); PPTg-cycle (PPTg stimulated only at night).\nIn post-surgery follow-up, PD patients reported a marked improvement of sleep quality in all DBS conditions. In particular, stimulation of the PPTg nucleus produced not only a remarkable long-term improvement of nighttime sleep, but unlike STN-DBS, also produced significant amelioration of daytime sleepiness.\nOur study suggests that PPTg-DBS plays an important role in reorganizing regular sleep in PD patients.",

The effects of peptide titration with the metal ions have been followed by mono- and bi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy in order to support the potentiometric results and to understand the details of metal binding. Only mononuclear complexes have been evidenced for all the checked metal ions with PK9-H peptide. Mononuclear and bis-complexes with PK9-C peptide have been evidenced with Cu(II) and Zn(II) metal ions. From the dissociation-constants and pM values obtained for the binary competition diagrams for the systems containing Cu(II), Zn(II) or Mn(II) and the two ligands, the Cu(II) ion is able to bind more efficiently than Zn(II) and Mn(II) metal ions to both ligands.",

    "abstract": "Delays in the initiation of a movement response and slowness during movement are among the hallmark motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). These impairments may result from deficits in neural structures related to perception, response programming, response initiation, or a combination of all three. However, the relative impact of each process on movement control in PD is still unclear. The present study investigated which processes might be responsible for the observed slowness. Patients performed a simple reaction time (RT) task involving arm extension where the normal 82 dB acoustic \"go\" signal was unexpectedly replaced with a 124 dB startling acoustic stimulus (SAS) on selected trials. The SAS was used as a probe of motor preparatory state since it has been shown to act as a subcortically-mediated involuntarily trigger for actions that are sufficiently prepared and waiting to be initiated by normal cortical processes. It was expected that release of the voluntary response by startle would not occur in PD patients if bradykinetic symptoms were attributable primarily to motor programming deficits. In contrast, results clearly showed that when a SAS was presented, the prepared response was elicited at a significantly shorter latency. In addition, the amplitude and timing pattern of EMG output appeared to be improved compared to control, resulting in a faster, more normalized movement. These results suggest that in PD patients motor programming processes are relatively intact, while the dysfunctional basal ganglia likely assert an inhibitory effect on the thalamo-cortical connections responsible for the initiation of motor acts.",

    "abstract": "The apoptosis pathway has been proposed to be involved in causing neuronal cell death in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. However, the details of this pathway are poorly understood. Previous research has shown increased acetylcholinesterase expression during apoptosis in various cell types, which suggests that acetylcholinesterase has a potential role in neuronal cell death. In this study, we found that acetylcholinesterase protein expression increased and caspase-3 was activated in PC12 cells treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium. Furthermore, the genetic or pharmacological inhibition of acetylcholinesterase was shown to protect PC12 cells from MPP+ induced apoptotic cell death. To study the function of acetylcholinesterase as a mechanism of neuronal cell death in vivo, we subsequently established a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine Parkinson's disease mouse model utilizing acetylcholinesterase-deficient mice. Studies in these mice revealed reduced dopaminergic neuron loss and lower expression levels of apoptotic proteins in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated heterozygous mice compared to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated wild-type mice. We conclude that it is highly probable that acetylcholinesterase is involved in the pathogenesis of the neurotoxin model of Parkinson's disease via apoptosis. Specifically, a deficiency or inhibition of acetylcholinesterase can decrease apoptosis and protect dopaminergic neurons in the neurotoxin model of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD) are the two most common age-related neurodegenerative diseases characterized by prominent neurodegeneration in selective neural systems. Although a small fraction of AD and PD cases exhibit evidence of heritability, among which many genes have been identified, the majority are sporadic without known causes. Molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and pathogenesis of these diseases remain elusive. Convincing evidence demonstrates oxidative stress as a prominent feature in AD and PD and links oxidative stress to the development of neuronal death and neural dysfunction, which suggests a key pathogenic role for oxidative stress in both AD and PD. Notably, mitochondrial dysfunction is also a prominent feature in these diseases, which is likely to be of critical importance in the genesis and amplification of reactive oxygen species and the pathophysiology of these diseases. In this review, we focus on changes in mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial dynamics, two aspects critical to the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis and function, in relationship with oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD and PD.",

    "abstract": "The present single center, double-blind, delayed start study was conducted to examine possible symptomatic and disease-modifying effects of GM1 ganglioside in Parkinson's disease (PD). Seventy-seven subjects with PD were randomly assigned to receive GM1 for 120 weeks (early-start group) or placebo for 24 weeks followed by GM1 for 96 weeks (delayed-start group). Washout evaluations occurred at 1 and 2 years after the end of treatment. Seventeen additional subjects who received standard-of-care were followed for comparative information about disease progression. Primary outcome was change from baseline Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores. At week 24, the early-start group had significant improvement in UPDRS motor scores vs. a significant worsening of scores in the delayed-start group. The early-start group also showed a sustained benefit vs. the delayed-start group at week 72 and at week 120. Both groups had significant symptom worsening during washout. This study provides evidence that GM1 use for 24 weeks was superior to placebo for improving motor symptoms and that extended GM1 use (up to 120 weeks) resulted in a lower than expected rate of symptom progression. The data from this small study suggest that GM1 may have symptomatic and potentially disease modifying effects on PD.",

We confirmed the earlier finding by observing a significant excess of GZ alleles in PD (4.8%) compared to controls (1.5%).

    "abstract": "A key feature of Parkinson's disease is the dopaminergic neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Besides inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis, a recent hypothesis suggested that degeneration of dopaminergic neurons occurs secondary to abnormal mitosis in these 'postmitotic neurons', ending up in apoptosis. Hence, recent therapies tried to prevent this mitotic cycle in dopaminergic neurons. However, most of the advocated therapies e.g., siRNA-induced silencing of cell cycle regulators, seems far from clinical application. In consequence, the use of anti-mitotic drugs could be a more practical alternative. Colchicine is one clinically approved drug that beyond its anti-mitotic effects has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. Moreover, clinical surveys proved that patients receiving colchicine for treating musculoskeletal disorders have lower incidence of Parkinson's disease. In addition, the difficult penetration of colchicines to the blood brain barrier disappears in parkinsonian patients due to depression of the p-glycoprotein efflux system. Based on these clinical data we explored the neuroprotective effects of colchicine in the rat rotenone model of Parkinson's disease. Thirty Sprague Dawley rats aged 3 months were divided into 3 equal groups. The first group received daily intraperitoneal injections of 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose 3 mL/kg. The second group received rotenone suspended in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose intraperitoneally at a dose of 3 mg/kg, daily. The third group received the same rotenone regimen plus daily oral colchicine at a dose of 20 \u03bcg/kg. All animals were evaluated regarding locomotor disturbance through a blinded investigator who monitored akinesia, tremors and performance on grid test. After 35 and 70 days the animals were sacrificed and their brains were immunostained against anti-tyrosine hydroxylase. Results showed protective effects of colchicine against rotenone induced neurotoxicity as evident by behavioral tests and immunostaining analysis. Thus, this study provides, for the first time, experimental evidence that colchicine protects against the neurotoxic effects of rotenone on dopaminergic neurons, warranting further investigation as a therapeutic option for Parkinson's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "Human adult olfactory epithelial-derived neural progenitors (hONPs) can differentiate along several neural lineages in response to morphogenic signals in vitro. A previous study optimized the transfection paradigm for the differentiation of hONPs to dopaminergic neurons. This study engrafted cells modified by the most efficient transfection paradigm for dopaminergic neural restriction and pretransfected controls into a unilateral neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine-induced parkinsonian rat model. Approximately 35% of the animals engrafted with hONPs had improved behavioral recovery as demonstrated by the amphetamine-induced rotation test, as well as a corner preference and cylinder paw preference, over a period of 24 weeks. The pre- and post-transfected groups produced equivalent responses, indicating that the toxic host environment supported hONP dopaminergic differentiation in situ. Human fibroblasts used as a cellular control did not diminish the parkinsonian rotational deficits at any point during the study. Increased numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells were detected in the engrafted brains compared with the fibroblast-implanted and medium-only controls. Engrafted TH-positive hONPs were detected for a minimum of 6 months in vivo; they were multipolar, had long processes, and migrated beyond their initial injection sites. Higher dopamine levels were detected in the striatum of behaviorally improved animals than in equivalent regions of their nonrecovered counterparts. Throughout these experiments, no evidence of tumorigenicity was observed. These results support our hypothesis that human adult olfactory epithelial-derived progenitors represent a unique autologous cell type with promising potential for future use in a cell-based therapy for patients with Parkinson's disease.",

Of the 273 male patients diagnosed between October 1, 1997, and September 30, 2009, 62 (22.7%) had a depressive disorder. The overall prevalence of anxiety disorders was 12.8%; patients with comorbid depression had a 5-fold greater prevalence of anxiety disorders than those without depression (35.5% vs 6.2%, P<.0001). Patients with comorbid depression also had increased prevalence of all physical illnesses examined and more outpatient clinic and mental health visits. Patients with Parkinson disease and comorbid depression are more likely to have anxiety disorders and several physical illnesses, to be using antipsychotic and dementia medicines, and to have increased health service utilization than those without depression.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a considerable socioeconomic burden. The pathomechanism of PD clearly involves the synergistic interaction of dopaminergic and glutamatergic dysfunctioning, including maladaptive corticostriatal synaptoplasticity. Most of the available treatment options have the aim of restoration of the physiological dopaminergic activity. Currently, the most widely used treatment is L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), which leads to the best symptomatic relief in PD. However, the long-term use of L-DOPA results in abnormal involuntary movements in almost all cases, the development of these dyskinetic movements also involving maladaptive corticostriatal synaptoplasticity. Perhaps chronic L-DOPA treatment has neurotoxic effects as well, but it has not yet been proved in clinical studies. Another important group of dopamine replacement therapy (DRT)-related side-effects consists of disinhibitory psychopathologies. Recent studies revealed that genetic polymorphisms affecting certain dopaminergic and glutamatergic receptors serve as independent risk factors for the development of these pathological conditions in PD patients. The available scientific data demonstrate that alterations in the kynurenine pathway of the tryptophan metabolism can be observed in PD and these alterations may contribute to the disease pathogenesis and to the occurrence of DRT-related side-effects. Therapeutic strategies that target the restoration of the kynurenine metabolism could therefore hold promise.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to demonstrate that application of rasagiline instead of selegiline with concomitant determination of L-amphetamine and L-methamphetamine in plasma is safe and well tolerated and influences sleep, mood, and motor behavior in patients with Parkinson's disease on a stable drug therapy. 30 patients, who took 7.5\u00a0mg selegiline daily for at least 3\u00a0months, were switched to 1\u00a0mg rasagiline. Then they were followed over an interval of 4\u00a0months. The remaining drug therapy remained stable. This changeover was safe and well tolerated. L-Amphetamine and L-methamphetamine only appeared during selegiline treatment. Motor behavior, motor complications, mood and sleep improved during rasagiline administration. Amphetamine-like derivatives of selegiline could contribute to sleep disturbances, which may be involved in worsening of mood. Motor behavior and motor complications probably became better due to the additional glutamate receptor antagonizing properties of rasagiline in this open label study.",

    "abstract": "Bladder dysfunctions are quite common in Parkinson's disease. They may occur at any stage of the illness and get worse with advancing and aggravating disease. The most prominent dysfunction is the so-called overactive bladder. Control of bladder function is part of a highly complex system subject to the interaction of predominantly the frontal and pontine micturition or continence center and the spinal cord. Besides there are some other anatomic structures involved in the complex control loop of bladder regulation. Regarding central regulation, dopamine is the essential neurotransmitter that inhibits bladder activity. All dopaminergic substances are capable of influencing automatic control systems. This also holds true for many other classes of other medications such as anticholinergics, antidepressants, and beta-blockers. The chief clinical problem of this patient consists in reduced inhibition with consequentially resulting overactivity of the detrusor muscle, meaning the urge to urinate in the absence of adequate bladder filling. The patients mostly complain of an imperative urge to urinate, of pollakisuria, nocturia and even incontinence of urine (urge incontinence). The objectives of diagnosis and therapy focus on controlled bladder evacuation and continence of urine. The most important diagnostic clues are provided by the patient's medical history. Only in rare cases urodynamic studies are indicated as well. For treatment we can avail ourselves of a number of anticholinergic drugs. We must watch out though that the medication ordered is not going to impact on cognition.We recommend tolteradine, not passing the blood brain barrier, or M3-specific antimuscarinics such as solifenacin and darifenacin. Positive therapeutic outcomes are limited. A new alternative at hand, albeit not approved for the time being, is the local injection of botulinum toxin into the detrusor muscle.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), its diagnosis, measurement of progression and response to therapeutic intervention currently rely upon clinical observation. However, there remains a critical need for validated biomarkers for PD. Among proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) there is ample biochemical, pathological, and genetic evidence that the metabolism of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PD. We first reported that PD patients had significantly lower \u03b1-syn levels in their CSF than the control groups. We then investigated the levels of \u03b1-syn oligomers in CSF using a specific self-developed ELISA. The levels of \u03b1-syn oligomers were significantly higher in the PD compared to the controls, with a sensitivity of 75.0% and a specificity of 87.5% for the diagnosis of PD, demonstrating that CSF \u03b1-syn oligomers can be a useful biomarker for diagnosis of PD. We have recently developed a proteomic profiling strategy for PD. CSF proteins were purified with C8 magnetic beads, and mass spectra were obtained by mass spectrometry. By building a Support vector machine classifier, PD and multiple system atrophy (MSA) were classified effectively with good cross-validation accuracy. A proteomic pattern classification method can increase the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of PD and MSA.",

    "abstract": "The repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been studied as a method to induce plasticity changes in the human brain. And rTMS is expected as a therapeutic tool for Parkinson's disease, depression, intractable pain and others. We reported a new rTMS protocol, quadripulse stimulation (QPS), is more effective. QPS consists of repeated trains of four monophasic TMS pulses separated by inter-stimulus intervals of 5 ms (QPS-5) and 50 ms (QPS-50), inducing bidirectional motor cortical plasticity in an ISI dependent. QPS-5 leads to the potentiation effect. QPS-50 leads to a depression effect. We investigated the changes of plasticity induced by QPS in patients with Parkinson's disease and the healthy volunteer with oral administration of levodopa. In patients with Parkinson's disease the effect of QPS-5 and QPS-50 was attenuated at Off period. However, when the On period it was recovered. In healthy subjects, effect of QPS was enhanced by levodopa, both QPS-5 and QPS-50.",

    "abstract": "Remarkable effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) has occupied the interest of many scientists and their efforts for elucidating its mechanism have given us a lot of clues for understanding of pathophysiology of PD. The early idea that DBS inhibits neuronal activity of the stimulated nucleus was based on the observation that it shows similar effects as lesions, standing behind the so-called firing rate model of PD pathophysiology. However, it has been also revealed that DBS induces changes indicative of activation of outputs from the stimulated structure, which is inconsistent with the firing rate model. On the other hand, recent studies have demonstrated abnormal discharge pattern in the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus of parkinsonian state, such as burst and oscillation, and its suppression by DBS. These support an idea that the pathological discharge interrupts normal information flow in the basal ganglia. Taken together, changes of firing pattern in the basal ganglia may be crucial for the PD pathophysiology, not a simple increase or decrease in firing rates. Besides, since DBS seems to affect the entire system of the basal ganglia and more, it is necessary to approach its mechanism with a systems-wide view.",

Several reports showed that better postoperative outcomes can be obtained when patient is managed by a neurologist who is responsible for stimulation programming and drug adjustments. The therapy should be done while adjusting both the drugs and the stimulation (DBS) simultaneously. Hence, neurologists should be familiar with programming of DBS, as well as the medical therapy.",

Appropriate patient selection, safe and precise surgery, and proper postoperative adjustment of stimulation and medication, are essential for the success of DBS. Patient selection is the most important role for the neurologist in DBS treatment. Neurologists treating PD should understand the correct indications and contraindications for DBS, and introduce it in a timely manner to patients who can be expected to benefit substantially from it. For long term treatment of PD, ideally the neurologist in charge of the patient should adjust both the stimulation parameters and medication.

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation of subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is currently the most common therapeutic surgical treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who have failed medical management. The percentage improvement in Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part II (activities of daily living) and III (motor) scores was more than 50%. Furthermore, levodopa-induced dyskinesias are dramatically improved because STN stimulation permits an approximately 50% reduction in antiparkinsonian treatment. How should we decide an appropriate candidate for DBS? It seems that there is a little difference about indication of DBS between neurosurgeons and neurologists. Since the efficacy of DBS is the improvement in dopaminergic drug-sensitive motor symptoms, we offer surgery to patients only when medical therapy has failed; (1) severe motor fluctuations, (2) severe dyskinesia, (3) tremor uncontrollable by medications, (4) painful dystonia, (5) side-effect for medication (drug-induced psychosis, nausea, vomitting). Taking account of contraindications is important to get successful outcome of the surgery. Dementia, cognitive deficits and psychosis (not drug-induced) are not improved by DBS. When patients are not able to see experienced doctors who manage in programming and dealing with postoperative problems, they are not appropriate candidates. Though benefit to mobility is evident, a risk-benefit assessment should to be made for each patient.",

    "abstract": "The current clinical trials of gene therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) are based on three strategies. 1. To restore the local production of dopamine by introducing genes associated with dopamine-synthesizing enzymes into the putamen. 2. To protect nigrostriatal projection by delivering the neurturin gene, a trophic factor for dopaminergic neurons, both in the putamen and the substantia nigra. 3. To modulate the neural activity by transducing the subthalamic nucleus with vectors expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase. A phase I clinical study was initiated in 2007 to determine the safety of intra-putaminal infusion of a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector encoding aromatic (L)-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). All six patients enrolled in the trial showed improvements from baseline in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores in the OFF medication state at 36 months after treatment. Although this trial was a small, open-label study and the use of a non-blinded, uncontrolled analysis limits interpretation, the efficacy outcomes are encouraging and indicate that the AAV vector-mediated gene transfer of AADC may benefit advanced PD patients. A similar approach, delivering AAV vector carrying AADC gene into the putamen ameliorated the symptoms in children with AADC deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment without dementia is frequent in Parkinson's disease. It often presents as a dysexecutive syndrome with deficient attentional resource allocation. The nature of attention deficits in Parkinson's disease has rarely been investigated with robust, theory-based tasks. The main objective of the present study was to investigate attention disorders in Parkinson's disease patients by applying a paradigm based on a model of attention. We also sought to identify the main demographic and clinical characteristics associated with attention deficits in Parkinson's disease.\nEighty non-demented Parkinson's disease patients and 60 healthy controls participated in the study. Attention was assessed in a computer-controlled reaction time paradigm. The test session comprised a simple reaction time task and four choice reaction time tasks: a go/no-go task, a one-dimension, focused-attention task, a two-dimension, divided-attention task and an alternating task. Performance was assessed by composite measures: (i) cognitive reaction time, corresponding to the difference between the simple reaction time and the choice reaction time in the given condition, and (ii) reaction time variability, corresponding to the sum of the coefficients of variance of the reaction times. Accuracy was also considered.\nApart from an overall slowing and greater reaction time variability, Parkinson's disease patients were only significantly impaired in the alternating condition. This set-shifting impairment was associated with their performance in the go/no-go and divided-attention conditions.\nOur systematic assessment of the different attentional subcomponents revealed that mental flexibility is particularly impaired in non-demented Parkinson's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to detect freezing of gait (FoG) events in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) using signals received from wearable sensors (six accelerometers and two gyroscopes) placed on the patients' body. For this purpose, an automated methodology has been developed which consists of four stages. In the first stage, missing values due to signal loss or degradation are replaced and then (second stage) low frequency components of the raw signal are removed. In the third stage, the entropy of the raw signal is calculated. Finally (fourth stage), four classification algorithms have been tested (Na\u00efve Bayes, Random Forests, Decision Trees and Random Tree) in order to detect the FoG events. The methodology has been evaluated using several different configurations of sensors in order to conclude to the set of sensors which can produce optimal FoG episode detection. Signals recorded from five healthy subjects, five patients with PD who presented the symptom of FoG and six patients who suffered from PD but they do not present FoG events. The signals included 93 FoG events with 405.6s total duration. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is able to detect FoG events with 81.94% sensitivity, 98.74% specificity, 96.11% accuracy and 98.6% area under curve (AUC) using the signals from all sensors and the Random Forests classification algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Neural transplantation is over a century old, but the modern era encompasses only the last 30-40 years. For most of this time period, research has focused on reversing disability engendered by neurologic disease and brain damage. Only recently was it recognized that the underlying neurological disease itself might negatively impact the grafted neurons. We have found that a subset of neurons within embryonic neural grafts that survive more than 10 years in Parkinson patients display Lewy bodies, a classical feature of Parkinson's disease neuropathology. Additionally, the grafted cells placed in the Parkinson's disease brain eventually downregulate the expression of dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase in a manner similar to what is seen in the substantia nigra dopamine neurons that are degenerating due to the disease. We discuss these findings in terms of how they might improve our understanding of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis and the effects they may have on the future of neural cell replacement strategies.",

    "abstract": "There is a major unmet need for therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) that go beyond treating symptoms and instead modify the course of the disease. The use of neural transplantation to repair the degenerating dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway is one strategy by which this might be achieved. A series of small, independent open-label studies initially reported beneficial effects in patients treated with cell transplants derived from the fetal ventral mesencephalon. However, this initial promise was subsequently tempered by negative results from two larger, randomized studies, and the emergence of complications related to the procedure. The reason for these discordant results has been debated and this has led to the development of a new, multicenter, collaborative study--TRANSEURO--which will ultimately herald the next generation of clinical trials of cell therapy in PD, including those involving stem cells. In this chapter, we discuss what has been learned from previous studies of neural transplantation and go on to consider how relevant disease-modifying effects could be demonstrated in PD. We then go on to discuss how the design of future trials of transplantation-based therapies might be better conceived and executed.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has long been considered predominantly to be a \"movement disorder,\" and it is only relatively recently that nonmotor symptoms of PD have been recognized to be a major concern to patients. Consequently, there has been surprisingly little investigation into the feasibility of utilizing cell replacement therapies to ameliorate any of the nonmotor dysfunctions of PD. In this chapter, we identify nonmotor impairments associated predominately with dopaminergic dysmodulation, evaluate the few emerging studies that have identified a role for dopamine and nigral transplantation in nonmotor performance, and consider a number of outstanding questions and considerations dominating the field of nigral transplantation today. Preliminary results obtained from rodent models of PD, despite being limited in number, give clear indications of graft effects on striatal processing beyond the simple activation of motor output and promise a major, exciting, and fruitful new avenue of research for the next decade. We can now consider the prospect of rewriting the opportunities for treating patients, with new stem cell sources to be complemented by new targets for therapeutic benefit.",

    "abstract": "Classical accounts of the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease have emphasized degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons with consequent dysfunction of cortico-striatal-thalamic loops. In contrast, post-mortem studies indicate that pathological changes in Parkinson's disease (Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies) first appear primarily in the lower brainstem with subsequent progression to more rostral parts of the neuraxis. The nigrostriatal and histological perspectives are not incompatible, but they do emphasize different anatomical structures. To address the question of which brain structures are functionally most affected by Parkinson's disease, we performed a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study focused on striatal functional connectivity. We contrasted 13 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease versus 19 age-matched control subjects, using methodology incorporating scrupulous attention to minimizing the effects of head motion during scanning. The principal finding in the Parkinson's disease group was markedly lower striatal correlations with thalamus, midbrain, pons and cerebellum. This result reinforces the importance of the brainstem in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. Focally altered functional connectivity also was observed in sensori-motor and visual areas of the cerebral cortex, as well the supramarginal gyrus. Striatal functional connectivity with the brainstem was graded (posterior putamen > anterior putamen > caudate), in both patients with Parkinson's disease and control subjects, in a manner that corresponds to well-documented gradient of striatal dopaminergic function loss in Parkinson's disease. We hypothesize that this gradient provides a clue to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons (DN) in the substantia nigra (SN). Several lines of evidence suggest that apoptotic cell death of DN is driven in part by non-cell autonomous mechanisms implicating microglial cells and inflammatory processes. Yet, how apoptotic DNs get removed by professional phagocytes and how this process modulates inflammatory processes are still unresolved issues. In this study, we investigated the role of MFGE8, a soluble factor involved in phagocytic recognition, in apoptotic DN clearance and neuroinflammation in PD. We report that glial expression of MFGE8 is enhanced in post-mortem PD brains compared to control individuals. Then, in vivo functional analysis of Mfge8 was assessed in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated mouse model of PD using wild-type (WT) and Mfge8-deficient mice. Neuropathological analysis consisted in evaluating (i) the loss of nigral DN and striatal DN terminals, (ii) the extent of glial cell activation and (iii) the number of apoptotic profiles. In vivo microglial phagocytic activity was further assessed by measuring the engulfment of apoptotic DN preloaded with fluorescent latex beads. Here we show that Mfge8 deficiency neither impact the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic bodies nor change the overall neuropathological parameters (DN cell loss and glial cell activation). In summary, our data argue that MFGE8 is not likely involved in the phagocytic clearance of neuronal debris associated with nigrostriatal pathway injury.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment is a clinical condition more frequent in patients with Parkinson's disease than in general population. The nonamnestic presentations, usually characterized by executive dysfunction, are most prevalent. We present a case report of a Parkinson's disease patient diagnosed with nonamnestic mild cognitive impairment that showed complete remission of cognitive symptoms after one year. We discuss the possible causes for the remission, focusing on the treatment of medical conditions such as a major depressive episode and vitamin B12 deficiency, in addition to the change of pharmacological treatment. In a third assessment, cognitive performance remained normal. The case report highlights the importance of controlling clinical comorbidities on the assessment and followup of mild cognitive impairment, especially on Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The role of arterial hypertension (HT) as risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) is still debated. Case-control and retrospective studies do not support an association between HT and PD and the risk of PD seems to be lower in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects. In addition, the use of calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors seems to have a protective effect on the risk of developing PD. In clinical practice, a crucial finding in subjects with PD is the high supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) coupled with orthostatic hypotension (OH). It is not clear whether this SBP load could be a risk factor for target organ damage as this load can be largely due to the drugs used to treat OH (i.e., fludrocortisone acetate, midodrine) or PD itself (i.e., monoamine oxidase inhibitors, dopamine D2-receptor antagonists). This blood pressure (BP) load is largely independent of medications as the 40 % of subjects with PD have a non-dipping pattern of BP during 24 h ambulatory monitoring (24-h ABPM). In PD, nocturnal HT is usually asymptomatic and 24-h ABPM should be used to track both supine HT and OH. Treatment of HT in PD is difficult because the reduction of supine BP could worsen OH. To avoid this, short-acting dihydropyridine CCBs, clonidine or nitrates are recommended, assuming between meals, in late afternoon or in the evening in avoiding an aggravation in the post-prandial hypotension characteristic of PD.",

    "abstract": "To assess the clinical effect of transplantation of human retinal pigment epithelial (hRPE) cells into the unilateral postcommissural putamen for treatment for Parkinson disease (PD).\nCells from postmortem human eye tissue (10-20\u00a0weeks of gestation) were cultured in vitro. Cells from -generation passage were implanted in PD postcommissural putamen with stereotactic operation in 12 patients with PD. All patients tolerated surgery well, and no major adverse events occurred. Eleven patients showed improvement in the primary outcome measure at 3\u00a0months post-treatment, particularly the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-M score in the off state. Response reached a peak at 12\u00a0months and declined during the next 24\u00a0months. At the 36-month endpoint, there were eight patients who felt better than at baseline. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed a trend with increased dopamine (DA) release during the first 6\u00a0months.\nHuman retinal pigment epithelial cells have the characteristics of neural progenitor cells and can be induced to differentiate into DA neurons. The results of this clinical trial suggest that the treatment of transplanted hRPE cells could improve symptoms of PD. These cells might serve as a useful source of DA neurons for neural graft in the treatment for PD.",

    "abstract": "There are limited data on treatment effect in early and drug-na\u00efve Parkinson's disease (PD) outside of clinical trials. We sought to review the treatment effects on motor symptoms in early, unselected PD patients.\nWe included 183 drug-na\u00efve patients from a longitudinal cohort (The Norwegian ParkWest study). At the time of diagnosis, motor symptoms were assessed and rated. Treatment was unrestricted, aimed at treating each patient optimally. Patients were reassessed after 12 months, and then grouped according to treatment: No dopaminergic treatment (NDT), dopamine agonists (DA) or levodopa. All strategies could be combined with monoamine oxidase B inhibitors.\nIn general, the chosen treatment was coherent with current practice. During follow-up, patients given NDT (n = 40) had unaltered clinical motor symptoms, as opposed to improvement in the DA- and levodopa-treated patients (n = 140). The overall improvement in these two groups was fairly similar, but axial symptoms did not improve in levodopa-treated patients as opposed to the younger DA-treated patients.\nTwelve months after the diagnosis, motor symptoms in approximately one-fifth of PD patients remained clinically stable. Tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity improved in the dopaminergic-treated patients. Axial symptoms were more treatment resistant, and the different symptomatic effects found between treatment strategies may be age related.",

    "abstract": "A 25-year-old pregnant woman was admitted with frequent episodes of supraventricular tachycardia associated with Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome. She was treated acutely with adenosine therapy during induction of labor and post-partum. Generally, pharmacologic treatment should be undertaken only for symptomatic arrhythmias or in hemodynamically compromised patients. Adenosine is the first choice for acute treatment of supraventricular tachycardia in pregnancy; several other options exist, but all have the potential for negative side effects for mother and fetus. Direct-current cardioversion is acceptable in all stages of pregnancy.",

A single-group interrupted time series design was used in this pilot study. Analyses were conducted on 22 participants, who provided data at pretest, post-test, and 3 month follow up. At each time point, participants completed a sleep diary and Parkinson's disease sleep scale. There was a significant difference between pretest and post-test (P\u2009<\u20090.01).

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a common and disabling disorder. No current therapy can slow or reverse disease progression. An important aspect of research in this field is target validation, a systematic approach to evaluating the likelihood that modification of a certain molecule, mechanism or biological pathway may be useful for the development of pharmacological or molecular treatments for the disease. TorsinA, a member of the AAA+ family of chaperone proteins, has been proposed as a potential target of neuroprotective therapy. TorsinA is found in Lewy bodies in human PD, and can suppress toxicity in cellular and invertebrate models of PD. Here, we evaluated the neuroprotective properties of torsinA in mouse models of PD based on intoxication with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) as well as recombinant adeno associated virus (rAAV) induced overexpression of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn). Using either transgenic mice with overexpression of human torsinA (hWT mice) or mice in which torsinA expression was induced using an rAAV vector, we found no evidence for protection against acute MPTP intoxication. Similarly, genetic deletion of the endogenous mouse gene for torsinA (Dyt1) using an rAAV delivered Cre recombinase did not enhance the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to MPTP. Overexpression of \u03b1-syn using rAAV in the mouse substantia nigra lead to a loss of TH positive neurons six months after administration, and no difference in the degree of loss was observed between transgenic animals expressing forms of torsinA and wild type controls. Collectively, we did not observe evidence for a protective effect of torsinA in the mouse models we examined. Each of these models has limitations, and there is no single model with established predictive value with respect to the human disease. Nevertheless, these data do seem to support the view that torsinA is unlikely to be successfully translated as a target of therapy for human PD.",

    "abstract": "The production of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain are both associated with the progression of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease. These characteristics are also observed when rodents are exposed to the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a compound that causes nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity and that has been used previously for assessing the effectiveness of neuroprotective agents. In this study, the neuroprotective effects of two coumarins, umbelliferone and esculetin, against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity were examined in C57BL/6J mice. The results show that dietary administration of umbelliferone and esculetin significantly attenuated MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in the substantia nigra pars compacta but not striatum, as measured by tyrosine hydroxylase staining. Both coumarins also prevented an MPTP-induced increase in nitrosative stress as measured by 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity and also maintained glutathione levels in MPTP-exposed mice as well as in cell lines exposed to the metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium. Umbelliferone and esculetin also prevented MPTP-dependent caspase 3 activation, an indicator of apoptosis, but did not inhibit monoamine oxidase activity. This is the first time that the neuroprotective capabilities of these coumarins have been demonstrated, and the results indicate that umbelliferone and esculetin can protect against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in the mouse. These compounds can cross the blood-brain barrier, so their effectiveness indicates that they have the potential to protect in neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease.",

The effects of DBS on the nonmotor symptoms are less well examined.

Here we review the pertinent evidence and conclude that, as a therapy, DBS has a major potential to contribute towards the holistic care of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies have provided cumulative evidence of gray matter (GM) atrophy in patients with Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) relative to healthy controls (HC). However, not all the studies reported entirely consistent findings. A systematic search for VBM studies of PDD patients and HC subjects published in PubMed and Embase databases from January 2000 to June 2012 was conducted. Meta-analysis was performed by using a newly improved voxel-based meta-analytic technique, effect size signed differential mapping, to quantitatively explore the GM abnormalities between PDD patients and HC subjects. A total of 6 cross-sectional VBM studies involving 105 PDD patients and 131 HC subjects met the inclusion criteria. Considerable regional GM decrease was detected in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and basal ganglia. The findings of the present study remained largely unchanged in the entire brain jackknife sensitivity analyses. Meta-regression showed dementia severity correlated with the left MTL. The present meta-analysis provided evidence of PDD-related GM atrophy, which suggested MTL and basal ganglia were implicated in PDD. This finding could give us further insight about the pathophysiological basis revealed by structure abnormalities in PDD.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the genes encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and \u03b1-synuclein are associated with both autosomal dominant and idiopathic forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). \u03b1-Synuclein is the main protein in Lewy bodies, hallmark inclusions present in both sporadic and familial PD. We show that in PD brain tissue, the levels of LRRK2 are positively related to the increase in \u03b1-synuclein phosphorylation and aggregation in affected brain regions (amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex), but not in the unaffected visual cortex. In disease-affected regions, we show co-localization of these two proteins in neurons and Lewy body inclusions. Further, in vitro experiments show a molecular interaction between \u03b1-synuclein and LRRK2 under endogenous and over-expression conditions. In a cell culture model of \u03b1-synuclein inclusion formation, LRRK2 co-localizes with the \u03b1-synuclein inclusions, and knocking down LRRK2 increases the number of smaller inclusions. In addition to providing strong evidence for an interaction between LRRK2 and \u03b1-synuclein, our results shed light on the complex relationship between these two proteins in the brains of patients with PD and the underlying molecular mechanisms of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the protein DJ-1 cause recessive forms of early onset familial Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, most of the causative mutations studied destabilize formation of DJ-1 homodimers, which appears to be closely linked to its normal function in oxidative stress and other cellular processes. Despite the importance of understanding the dimerization dynamics of this protein, this aspect of DJ-1 biology has not previously been directly studied in living cells. Here, we use bimolecular fluorescence complementation to study DJ-1 dimerization and find not only that DJ-1 forms homodimers in living cells but that most PD causative DJ-1 mutations disrupt this process, including the L166P, M26I, L10P, and P158\u2206 mutations. Interestingly, the E64D mutant form of DJ-1 retains the ability to form homodimers. However, while wild-type DJ-1 dimers are stabilized under oxidative stress conditions, we find that the E64D mutation blocks this stabilization. Furthermore, our data show that the E64D mutation potentiates the formation of aggresomes containing DJ-1. We also observe that while the widely studied L166P mutation prevents DJ-1 from forming homodimers or heterodimers with wild-type protein, the mutant protein is able to partially disrupt formation of wild-type homodimers. In summary, by investigating DJ-1 dimerization in living cells, we have uncovered several novel properties of PD causative mutations in DJ-1, which may ultimately provide novel insight into PD pathogenesis and possible therapeutic options.",

To provide a precise functional assignment of position to the observed activities, for each patient we mapped its classified multichannel STN MERs to a generic atlas representation with a sensorimotor part and a remaining part.\nWithin the sensorimotor part we found significantly higher mean firing rate (P < 0.05) and significantly more burst-like activity (P < 0.05) than within the remaining part. The proportion of significant coherence in the beta band (13-30 Hz) is significantly higher in the sensorimotor part of the STN than elsewhere (P = 0.015).\nThe STN sensorimotor part distinguishes itself from the remaining part with respect to beta coherence, firing rate and burst-like activity and postoperatively was found as the preferred target area.\nOur firing behavior analysis may help to discriminate the STN sensorimotor part for the placement of the DBS electrode.",

    "abstract": "Dyskinesia is a common side effect of prolonged dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease patients. Assessing the severity of dyskinesia could help develop better pharmacological and surgical interventions. We have developed a semi-automatic video-based objective dyskinesia quantifying measure called the severity score (SVS) that was evaluated on 35 patient videos. We present a study to evaluate the utility of our severity score and compare its performance to clinical ratings of neurologists. In addition to the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) score for each video, four neurologists provided three sets of time lapsed ratings and rankings of the 35 videos using a specifically developed protocol. The statistical analysis of our data using Kendall's tau-b and intra-class correlations shows that (a) ranking patient videos based on severity is suitable for studying the utility of the SVS, and (b) SVS exhibits moderate utility to quantify dyskinesia severity when compared to manual assessment of dyskinesia by neurologists using the UDysRS. These results support the effective use of SVS as an objective measure to quantify dyskinesia and the rationale for a ranking system that complements traditional rating scales.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the phospholipase A2 Group 6 (PLA2G6) gene have been identified in autosomal recessive neurodegenerative diseases classified as infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. Recently, PLA2G6 was also reported as the causative gene for early-onset PARK14-linked dystonia-parkinsonism.\nTo address whether PLA2G6 mutations are also an important cause of PD, we screened sequence variants of PLA2G6 in 250 PD patients and 550 controls in a Chinese Han populations. We identified four sequence changes: a coding synonymous c.1959T>A transition of exon13 in one patient, two missense mutations c.1966C>G in exon13 and c.2077C>G in exon14 in two different patients, which caused two amino acids change Leu656Val and Leu693Val respectively. We also found a frame-shift mutation P.His597fx69 in exon 12 in one patient. These four rare variants were not represented in 550 control individuals. Furthermore, we found that WT PLA2G6 enzyme hydrolyzed phospholipids while mutant PLA2G6 with P.His597fx69 frame-shift caused loss of enzyme activity, exhibiting less than 6% of the specific activity in phospholipase assays compared to that of WT PLA2G6. Mutant PLA2G6 with Leu656Val and Leu693Val decreased their activity by 45% and 35% in phospholipase assay respectively.\nWe identified four rare PLA2G6 mutations in 250 PD patients, enlarging the spectrum of PLA2G6 mutations in PD. Although PLA2G6 mutations account for only a small fraction of PD patients in Chinese populations, these mutations impair catalytic activity of their phospholipids-hydrolyzing function. These results indicate that PLA2G6 mutations maybe PD-causing in Chinese Han populations.",

    "abstract": "Weight loss affects more than 50% of subjects suffering from Parkinson's Disease (PD) and is associated with reduced life expectancy. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and the mechanism of PD metabolism control is unresolved. This cross-sectional study aimed to ascertain the relationship between rest energy expenditure (REE), PD duration, Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage, drug therapy and body mass index (BMI), in order to determine possible predictors of weight loss.\nWe studied fifty-eight PD subjects, after excluding conditions with a known influence on metabolism and weight (severe tremor, dyskinesias, dementia, fever, on-going infections, thyroid disease, and dysphagia). Subjects underwent REE measurement, through indirect calorimetry, in both the OFF state (12 h fasting and off medications) and in the ON state (60 min after taking dopaminergic drugs).\nOFF state. In the majority of PD patients REE values did not differ from those expected (based upon age, gender and BMI), being significantly higher in subjects in H&Y stage IV than H&Y stage II (t = 3.5; p = 0.001). Disease duration and rigidity were significantly associated with increased REE (r(2) = 0.31, F = 3.6; p = 0.0045). ON state. REE decreased by approximately 8% in all subjects, irrespective of disease duration or H&Y stage. BMI was inversely related to disease duration and UPDRS motor score in the OFF state and directly related to UPDRS motor score in the ON state (r(2) = 0.333, F = 3.5; p = 0.003).\nIn PD REE increases as a function of disease duration; its adverse role in the decrease in BMI seems to be compensated for by dopaminergic medication.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, defined by the presence of resting tremor, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. PD is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. The neuropathological hallmark of the disease is the presence of intracytoplasmic inclusions, called Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs), containing \u03b1-synuclein, a small protein which is widely expressed in the brain. The \u03b1-synuclein gene, SNCA, is located on chromosome 4q22.1; SNCA-linked PD shows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with a relatively early onset age, and it usually progresses rapidly. Three missense mutations, A53T, A30P, and E46K, in addition to gene multiplications of the SNCA have been described so far. Although it is clear that LBs and LNs contain mainly the \u03b1-synuclein protein, the mechanism(s) which leads \u03b1-synuclein to accumulate needs to be elucidated. The primary question in the molecular pathology of PD is how wild-type \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in PD, and which interacting partner(s) plays role(s) in the aggregation process. It is known that dopamine synthesis is a stressfull event, and \u03b1-synuclein expression somehow affects the dopamine synthesis. The aberrant interactions of \u03b1-synuclein with the proteins in the dopamine synthesis pathway may cause disturbances in cellular mechanisms. The normal physiological folding state of \u03b1-synuclein is also important for the understanding of pathological aggregates. Recent studies on the \u03b1-synuclein protein and genome-wide association studies of the \u03b1-synuclein gene show that PD has a strong genetic component, and both familial and idiopathic PD have a common denominator, \u03b1-synuclein, at the molecular level. It is clear that the disease process in Parkinson's disease, as in other neurodegenerative disorders, is very complicated; there can be several different molecular pathways which are responsible for diverse and possibly also unrelated functions inside the neuron, playing roles in PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine transporter scans of some patients who have been clinically diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) fail to reveal abnormal dopaminergic functioning and are referred to as scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficits (SWEDDs). In this study, we investigated the differences between SWEDDs patients and PD patients using (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scans. This study enrolled 20 patients with SWEDDs, 30 patients with early PD and 50 healthy controls. Cardiac (123)I-MIBG scans were performed on all subjects, and parameters including the early and delayed heart-to-mediastinum ratios (H/M) and the washout rate were compared among the three groups. The mean delayed H/M ratio in the PD group (mean \u00b1 standard deviation, 1.45 \u00b1 0.23) was the lowest of the three groups, and the scans in the group without evidence of dopaminergic deficits exhibited a lower mean delayed H/M ratio (2.15 \u00b1 0.48) than the control group (2.56 \u00b1 0.55) (p < 0.05). The intermediate status of cardiac MIBG uptake in the SWEDDs patients in our study may have been due to the heterogeneity of the SWEDDs patients; some of these patients had Parkinsonism with unknown characteristics, some may have had early PD with false-negative dopamine transporter imaging, and some have had primary dystonia that was misdiagnosed as PD. These uncharacterised SWEDDs patients accounted for a larger proportion of the heterogeneous SWEDDs than observed in previous studies, but our results suggest that cardiac (123)I-MIBG scans may help to differentiate patients with SWEDDs from patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a gradual loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) of the brain. Ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3) has multiple functions related to protein synthesis, antioxidative activity, and UV endonuclease III activity. We have previously shown that PEP-1-rpS3 inhibits skin inflammation and provides neuroprotection against experimental cerebral ischemic damage. In this study, we examined whether PEP-1-rpS3 can protect DA neurons against oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. PEP-1-rpS3 was efficiently delivered to SH-SY5Y cells and the SN of the brain as confirmed by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. PEP-1-rpS3 significantly inhibited reactive oxygen species generation and DNA fragmentation induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, consequently leading to the survival of SH-SY5Y cells. The neuroprotection was related to the antiapoptotic activity of PEP-1-rpS3 that affected the levels of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic mediators. In addition, immunohistochemical data collected using a tyrosine hydroxylase antibody and cresyl violet staining demonstrated that PEP-1-rpS3 markedly protected DA cells in the SN against MPTP-induced oxidative stress. Therefore, our results suggest that PEP-1-rpS3 may be a potential therapy for PD.",

    "abstract": "Local field potential recordings made from the basal ganglia of patients undergoing deep brain stimulation have suggested that frequency specific activity is involved in determining the rate of force development and the peak force at the outset of a movement. However, the extent to which the basal ganglia might be involved in motor performance later on in a sustained contraction is less clear. We therefore recorded from the subthalamic nucleus region (STNr) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) as they made maximal voluntary grips. Relative to age-matched controls they had more rapid force decrement when contraction was meant to be sustained and prolonged release reaction time and slower rate of force offset when they were supposed to release the grip. These impairments were independent from medication status. Increased STNr power over 5-12 Hz (in the theta/alpha band) independently predicted better performance-reduced force decrement, shortened release reaction time and faster rate of force offset. In contrast, lower mean levels and progressive reduction of STNr power over 55-375 Hz (high gamma/high frequency) over the period when contraction was meant to be sustained were both strongly associated with greater force decrement over time. Higher power over 13-23 Hz (low beta) was associated with more rapid force decrement during the period when grip should have been sustained, and with a paradoxical shortening of the release reaction time. These observations suggest that STNr activities at 5-12 Hz and 55-375 Hz are necessary for optimal grip performance and that deficiencies of such activities lead to motor impairments. In contrast, increased levels of 13-25 Hz activity both promote force decrement and shorten the release reaction time, consistent with a role in antagonising (and terminating) voluntary movement. Frequency specific oscillatory activities in the STNr impact on motor performance from the beginning to the end of a voluntary grip.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease, affecting 1-2% of the population over the age of 65. Both genetic and environmental factors trigger risks of and protection from PD. However, the molecular mechanism of PD is far from being clear. In this study, we downloaded the gene expression profile of PD from Gene Expression Omnibus and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and dysfunctional pathways in PD patients compared with controls. To further understand how these pathways act together to account for the initiation of PD, we constructed a pathway crosstalk network by calculating the Jaccard index among pathways. A total of 873 DEGs and 16 dysfunctional pathways between PD patients and controls were identified. Through constructing a network of pathways, the relationships among PD pathways were visually presented by their interactions. Our results demonstrate the existence of crosstalk between different pathways in PD pathogenesis. These results not only may explain the causes of PD, but could also open the door to new therapeutic approaches for this disease.",

    "abstract": "A relation between the side of motor onset and cognitive impairment in early PD has been reported, suggesting that the asymmetric degeneration affecting subcortical regions may play a pivotal role in lateralized cognitive function. However, evidences are controversial and all previous studies were performed on treated patients, though it is known that dopaminergic therapy can affect cognition in PD.\nSixty-nine early untreated PD patients underwent an extensive neuropsychological battery exploring memory, visuospatial and attention/executive functions. Patients were divided with respect of the side of onset (right vs. left) and further grouped according to motor phenotype (tremor vs. rigidity-bradykinesia). Multivariate analysis of variance has been carried out to compare clinical and neuropsychological data between subgroups.\nThere were no differences in any neuropsychological task between right-sided and left-sided onset subgroups, irrespective of tremor dominant or rigid-bradykinetic phenotype. Age at onset was significantly higher in patients with any cognitive impairment as compared with patients without (66.7 \u00b1 3.2 vs. 56.3 \u00b1 6.8 years, p = 0.001).\nSide of motor onset is not a major determinant for developing lateralized cognitive deficits in newly diagnosed untreated PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine cell loss and increased iron in the substantia nigra (SN) characterize Parkinson's disease (PD), with cerebellar involvement increasingly recognized, particularly in motor compensation and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) development. Because the red nucleus (RN) mediates cerebellar circuitry, we hypothesized that RN iron changes might reflect cerebellum-related compensation, and/or the intrinsic capacity for LID development. We acquired high resolution magnetic resonance images from 23 control and 38 PD subjects (12 with PD and history of LID [PD+DYS]) and 26 with PD and no history of LID (PD-DYS). Iron content was estimated from bilateral RN and SN transverse relaxation rates (R2*). PD subjects overall displayed higher R2* values in both the SN and RN. RN R2* values correlated with off-drug Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-motor scores, but not disease duration or drug dosage. RN R2* values were significantly higher in PD+DYS compared with control and PD-DYS subjects; control and PD-DYS subjects did not differ. The association of higher RN iron content with PD-related dyskinesia suggests increased iron content is involved in, or reflects, greater cerebellar compensatory capacity and thus increased likelihood of LID development.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress has been reported as one of the pathogeneses of Parkinson's disease (PD). Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of the target genes involved in antioxidant pathway. The promoter polymorphisms of the Nrf2-encoding gene, NFE2L2, have been shown to affect the promoter activity. Inconsistent findings of the associations between NFE2L2 promoter polymorphisms and PD have been reported in a multiple candidate gene study, a whole-genome association study, and a case-control study in multiple ethnicity groups. This study enrolled a total of 1006 individuals composed of 480 PD patients and 526 controls to evaluate if there was an association of the NFE2L2 promoter polymorphisms with PD susceptibility in the Taiwan population. Three promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs35652124, rs6706649, and rs6721961 were examined using polymerase chain reaction and restriction analysis. The associations of each of the SNPs and the haplotypes constructed by the variations with PD susceptibility were examined. In spite of adequate statistic power, we observe no association of the three SNPs and their haplotypes with PD in a Taiwanese population. One of the reasons for the association disparity may include the genomic differences in ethnicities and environmental factors in different geographical regions.",

It included i) acceptability, ii) dimensionality construct validity, and iii) a complete general correlation structure of data. Finally, criterion validity of the final version of the instrument was assessed.\nThe initial questionnaire was reduced to five items (PD-SAST) with a cut-off score of 2. Psychometric analysis revealed three factors corresponding to \"Preoccupation\", \"Cannot stop\" and \"Relationship disturbance\". The discriminant validity of the PD-SAST was high (ROC area under the curve: 0.96).\nThe PD-SAST performs well as a screening instrument. It has been found to be acceptable to patients and is ready for use. Moreover, it tests multidimensional aspects of hypersexuality.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's (PwP) experience frequent and recurrent falls. As these falls may have devastating consequences, there is an urgent need to identify cost-effective interventions with the potential to reduce falls in PwP. The purpose of this economic evaluation is to compare the costs and cost-effectiveness of a targeted exercise programme versus usual care for PwP who were at risk of falling.\nOne hundred and thirty participants were recruited through specialist clinics, primary care and Parkinson's support groups and randomised to either an exercise intervention or usual care. Health and social care utilisation and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D) were assessed over the 20 weeks of the study (ten-week intervention period and ten-week follow up period), and these data were complete for 93 participants. Incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was estimated. The uncertainty around costs and QALYs was represented using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.\nThe mean cost of the intervention was \u00a376 per participant. Although in direction of favour of exercise intervention, there was no statistically significant differences between groups in total healthcare (-\u00a3128, 95% CI: -734 to 478), combined health and social care costs (\u00a3-35, 95% CI: -817 to 746) or QALYs (0.03, 95% CI: -0.02 to 0.03) at 20 weeks. Nevertheless, exploration of the uncertainty surrounding these estimates suggests there is more than 80% probability that the exercise intervention is a cost-effective strategy relative to usual care.\nWhilst we found no difference between groups in total healthcare, total social care cost and QALYs, analyses indicate that there is high probability that the exercise intervention is cost-effective compared with usual care. These results require confirmation by larger trial-based economic evaluations and over the longer term.",

    "abstract": "It has been recently discovered that transposable elements show high activity in the brain of mammals, however, the magnitude of their influence on its functioning is unclear so far. In this paper, I use flux balance analysis to examine the influence of somatic retrotransposition on brain metabolism, and the biosynthesis of its key metabolites, including neurotransmitters. The analysis shows that somatic transposition in the human brain can influence the biosynthesis of more than 250 metabolites, including dopamine, serotonin and glutamate, shows large inter-individual variability in metabolic effects, and may contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.\nThis article was reviewed by Dr Kenji Kojima (nominated by Dr Jerzy Jurka) and Dr Eugene Koonin.",

    "abstract": "Rasagiline is a second-generation, irreversible MAO-B inhibitor (MAOB-I) previously shown to be efficacious and well-tolerated compared to placebo in the treatment of early Parkinson's disease (PD). ACTOR (ACceptabilit\u00e9 TOl\u00e9rance Rasagiline) was a 15-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind study aimed to assess the safety and tolerability of rasagiline compared to the dopaminergic agonist pramipexole in the treatment of early PD.\nPatients with early, untreated idiopathic PD were randomized to receive 1\u2009mg rasagiline (n\u2009=\u200953) or 1.5\u2009mg pramipexole (n\u2009=\u200956) daily. The primary outcome was the number of patients experiencing a 'clinically important adverse event' (classified as a serious adverse event, an event leading to withdrawal or severe according to the patient). Safety outcomes were evaluated by the investigator and the patient. Analysis of the primary criterion was a comparative analysis using the chi-squared test. The Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test was conducted to test the severity of patient-reported adverse events. Other tests performed include a covariance analysis and Student's t-tests.\nMean disease duration was 3.4 months, and mean age was 62.6 years. Of patients taking pramipexole, 44.6% reported at least one 'clinically important' adverse event compared to 32.1% of patients taking rasagiline; non-inferiority of rasagiline was reached, with a difference in proportions of -12.6% [confidence interval of -27.8%; 2.6%]. There were no significant differences in clinical effectiveness between the treatments, measured by clinical and patient global impression of improvement (CGI-I, PGI-I) and PDQ-8 scales. A significant decrease in the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms (p\u2009=\u20090.015) and sleep disorders (p\u2009=\u20090.027) was reported by physicians in the rasagiline group compared to the pramipexole group; the propensity to sleepiness improved significantly in the rasagiline group (p\u2009=\u20090.020), and worsened in the pramipexole group (p\u2009=\u20090.042).\nLimitations of this study include the limited sample size due to the lower than anticipated recruitment and the accidental inclusion of a patient who had taken contraindicated medication.\nIn this study, the safety profile of rasagiline had clinically favorable differences in gastrointestinal and sleep adverse events compared to pramipexole, whilst showing comparable clinician and patient-rated clinical effectiveness as a monotherapy for the treatment of early idiopathic PD.",

We carried out a cross-sectional study including 177 healthy controls and 177 PD patients attending a tertiary care center. We recorded weight and height for all participants. A statistically significant difference was found in body mass index (BMI) between controls and PD patients (29.1\u00b15.4 versus 27.2\u00b14.7, p<0.001). In the PD Group, two patients were underweight, 32.7% were within normal range, 46.9% had overweight, and 19.2% were obese. Overweight and normal weight were more prevalent in the PD Group (p=<0.01 and <0.001, respectively) when compared to controls.

    "abstract": "The newly developed brief-balance evaluation system test (brief-BESTest) may be useful for measuring balance and predicting falls in individuals with Parkinson disease (PD).\nThe purposes of this study were: (1) to describe the balance performance of those with PD using the brief-BESTest, (2) to determine the relationships among the scores derived from the 3 versions of the BESTest (i.e., full BESTest, mini-BESTest, and brief-BESTest), and (3) to compare the accuracy of the brief-BESTest with that of the mini-BESTest and BESTest in identifying recurrent fallers among people with PD.\nThis was a prospective cohort study.\nEighty participants with PD completed a baseline balance assessment. All participants reported a fall history during the previous 6 months. Fall history was again collected 6 months (n=51) and 12 months (n=40) later.\nAt baseline, participants had varying levels of balance impairment, and brief-BESTest scores were significantly correlated with mini-BESTest (r=.94, P<.001) and BESTest (r=.95, P<.001) scores. Six-month retrospective fall prediction accuracy of the Brief-BESTest was moderately high (area under the curve [AUC]=0.82, sensitivity=0.76, and specificity=0.84). Prospective fall prediction accuracy over 6 months was similarly accurate (AUC=0.88, sensitivity=0.71, and specificity=0.87), but was less sensitive over 12 months (AUC=0.76, sensitivity=0.53, and specificity=0.93).\nThe sample included primarily individuals with mild to moderate PD. Also, there was a moderate dropout rate at 6 and 12 months.\nAll versions of the BESTest were reasonably accurate in identifying future recurrent fallers, especially during the 6 months following assessment. Clinicians can reasonably rely on the brief-BESTest for predicting falls, particularly when time and equipment constraints are of concern.",

    "abstract": "Hypovitaminosis D and K due to malnutrition or sunlight deprivation, increased bone resorption due to immobilization, low bone mineral density (BMD) and an increased risk of falls may contribute to an increased risk of hip fractures in patients with Parkinson's disease. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the efficacy of interventions intended to prevent hip fractures in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease. PubMed was used to search the literature for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding Parkinson's disease and hip fractures. The inclusion criteria were 50 or more subjects per group and a study period of 1 year or longer. Five RCTs were identified and the relative risk and 95% confidence interval were calculated for individual RCTs. Sunlight exposure increased serum hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration, improved motor function, decreased bone resorption and increased BMD. Alendronate or risedronate with vitamin D supplementation increased serum 25(OH)D concentration, strongly decreased bone resorption and increased BMD. Menatetrenone (vitamin K(2)) decreased serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin concentration, decreased bone resorption and increased BMD. Sunlight exposure (men and women), menatetrenone (women), alendronate and risedronate with vitamin D supplementation (women) significantly reduced the incidence of hip fractures. The respective RRs (95% confidence intervals) according to the intention-to-treat analysis were 0.27 (0.08, 0.96), 0.13 (0.02, 0.97), 0.29 (0.10, 0.85) and 0.20 (0.06, 0.68). Interventions, including sunlight exposure, menatetrenone and oral bisphosphonates with vitamin D supplementation, have a protective effect against hip fractures elderly patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "We compared caregiver burden in Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD) to that in Alzheimer disease (AD) and examined the factors contributing to the burden in PDD. Totally, 42 patients with PDD and 109 patients with AD and their caregivers participated in this study. The caregiver burden was measured using the Burden Interview (BI). Scores of Barthel activities of daily living (BADLs), Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating of patients, and score of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, and Euro-quality of life of the caregivers were examined. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr stage of the patients were administered to assess burden relating to parkinsonism on PDD. We used multiple linear regression to assess the predictors. The BI of caregivers was higher in PDD (47.9, Standard deviation [SD]: 3.8) than in AD (36.3, SD:2.1). In the AD group, the BI was predicted by cognitive function ((\u03b2\u00b1SE: -0.8\u00b10.4, P value=04) and basic ADL status of patients (\u03b2\u00b1SE: -1.3\u00b10.1, P<.001), depressive symptoms (\u03b2\u00b1SE: 1.1\u00b10.1, P<.001), and poor quality of life (\u03b2\u00b1SE: -0.2\u00b10.1, P=.017) in caregivers. In PDD group, BI was predicted only by scores of Part 1 on the UPDRS (\u03b2\u00b1SE: 2.9\u00b11.3, P=.03) of patients and depressive symptoms (\u03b2\u00b1SE: 1.1\u00b10.2, P<.001) of the caregivers. We concluded the caregiver burden is higher in PDD than in AD and factors predicting burden are different in AD and PDD. In patients with PDD, the neuropsychiatric problems are the major contributor to caregiver burden.",

    "abstract": "In recent years we have witnessed a growing tendency to opt for the use of dopamine agonists (DA) as treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), with the aim of delaying as far as possible the development of fluctuations and dyskinesias. Yet, levodopa continues to be the most effective antiparkinson drug and is probably the one that improves the greatest number of symptoms of the disease. This article reports on the results of a comprehensive review of the literature dealing with the benefits and risks of levodopa treatment in patients with PD which was conducted by a group of expert neurologists and members of the Spanish Neurology Society's Movement Disorder Group. The main conclusion reached in this article is that levodopa continues to be the most effective treatment for PD. Although the risk and incidence of developing dyskinesias remains at a lower level in the group initially treated with DA, the number of patients who develop disabling dyskinesias is very low in all the studies and is similar for DA and for levodopa. Scores on the quality of life scales are also similar in the two groups, which casts some doubt on the impact that these motor complications have on the quality of life of patients with PD. In view of these findings, we should consider whether there is any real justification for depriving patients of the good control of their symptoms offered by levodopa owing to the fear of developing dyskinesias or mild motor fluctuations that are not really going to have any negative effect on their quality of life. There is also the possibility of their developing severe side effects, which are more frequent with the use of DA.",

Since genetic factors could play a role in determining the occurrence of these problems, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether possible functional polymorphisms among DRD2 and ANKK1 genes are associated with the risk of developing dyskinesia and motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease patients.\nOne hundred and ninety nine patients in treatment with levodopa were genotyped for the -141CIns/Del, rs2283265, rs1076560, C957T, TaqIA and rs2734849 polymorphisms at the DRD2/ANKK1 gene region.\nCarriers of the TTCTA haplotype showed an increased risk for the presence of dyskinesia (p = 0.007; 1.538 [95% CI: 1.126-2.101]).\nOur data suggest an influence of the DRD2/ANKK1 gene region on levodopa-induced dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated how Parkinson's disease alters haptic perception and the underlying mechanisms of somatosensory and sensorimotor integration. Changes in haptic sensitivity and acuity (the abilities to detect and to discriminate between haptic stimuli) due to Parkinson's disease were systematically quantified and contrasted to the performance of healthy older and young adults. Using a robotic force environment, virtual contours of various curvatures were presented. Participants explored these contours with their hands and indicated verbally whether they could detect or discriminate between two contours. To understand what aspects of sensory or sensorimotor integration are altered by ageing and disease, we manipulated the sensorimotor aspect of the task: the robot either guided the hand along the contour or the participant actively moved the hand. Active exploration relies on multimodal sensory and sensorimotor integration, while passive guidance only requires sensory integration of proprioceptive and tactile information. The main findings of the study are as follows: first, a decline in haptic precision can already be observed in adults before the age of 70 years. Parkinson's disease may lead to an additional decrease in haptic sensitivity well beyond the levels typically seen in middle-aged and older adults. Second, the haptic deficit in Parkinson's disease is general in nature. It becomes manifest as a decrease in sensitivity and acuity (i.e. a smaller perceivable range and a diminished ability to discriminate between two perceivable haptic stimuli). Third, thresholds during both active and passive exploration are elevated, but not significantly different from each other. That is, active exploration did not enhance the haptic deficit when compared to passive hand motion. This implies that Parkinson's disease affects early stages of somatosensory integration that ultimately have an impact on processes of sensorimotor integration. Our results suggest that the known motor problems in Parkinson's disease that are generally characterized as a failure of sensorimotor integration may, in fact, have a sensory origin.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that can, at least partly, be mimicked by the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. S100B is a calcium-binding protein expressed in, and secreted by, astrocytes. There is increasing evidence that S100B acts as a cytokine or damage-associated molecular pattern protein not only in inflammatory but also in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we show that S100B protein levels were higher in post-mortem substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease compared with control tissue, and cerebrospinal fluid S100B levels were higher in a large cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease compared with controls. Correspondingly, mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine showed upregulated S100B messenger RNA and protein levels. In turn, ablation of S100B resulted in neuroprotection, reduced microgliosis and reduced expression of both the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1. Our results demonstrate a role of S100B in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. Targeting S100B may emerge as a potential treatment strategy in this disorder.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system and is regarded as one of the most common neurologic diseases. Myxobacterial metabolites have been shown to possess a wide range of beneficial physiological effects, including anti-fungal, antibiotic, and anti-tumor activities. We aimed to determine whether myxobacterial metabolites exhibit a potential therapeutic effect in cells from a Parkinson's disease mouse model. The screening process identified 4 compounds, which were found to increase cell growth rate by >1.3 times that observed on the vehicle. These compounds promoted regeneration of the cells from a Parkinson's mouse model following the appearance of acute lesions, and reduced the levels of proteins associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptotic cell death. These compounds could lead to the development of novel therapies for Parkinson's disease and provide insight into the mechanisms through which apoptotic cell death takes place in this disorder.",

    "abstract": "Patients with advanced Parkinson's disease often have rapid swings between mobility and immobility, and many respond unsatisfactorily to adjustments in pharmacological treatment. We assessed whether globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) gives greater functional improvement than does subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS.\nWe recruited patients from five centres in the Netherlands who were aged 18 years or older, had idiopathic Parkinson's disease, and had, despite optimum pharmacological treatment, at least one of the following symptoms: severe response fluctuations, dyskinesias, painful dystonias, or bradykinesia. By use of a computer-generated randomisation sequence, we randomly assigned patients to receive either GPi DBS or STN DBS (1:1), applying a minimisation procedure according to drug use (levodopa equivalent dose <1000 mg vs \u22651000 mg) and treatment centre. Patients and study assessors (but not those who assessed adverse events) were masked to treatment allocation. We had two primary outcomes: functional health as measured by the weighted Academic Medical Center Linear Disability Scale (ALDS; weighted by time spent in the off phase and on phase) and a composite score for cognitive, mood, and behavioural effects up to 1 year after surgery. Secondary outcomes were symptom scales, activities of daily living scales, a quality-of-life questionnaire, the occurrence of adverse events, and drug use. We used the intention-to-treat principle for all analyses. This trial is registered with www.controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN85542074.\nBetween Feb 1, 2007, and March 29, 2011, we enrolled 128 patients, assigning 65 to GPi DBS and 63 to STN DBS. We found no statistically significant difference in either of our primary outcomes: mean change in weighted ALDS (3\u00b70 [SD 14\u00b75] in the GPi group vs 7\u00b77 [23\u00b72] in the STN group; p=0\u00b728) and the number of patients with cognitive, mood, and behavioural side-effects (36 [58%] of 62 patients in the GPi group vs 35 [56%] of 63 patients in the STN group; p=0\u00b794). Secondary outcomes showed larger improvements in off-drug phase in the STN group compared with the GPi group in the mean change in unified Parkinson's disease rating scale motor examination scores (20\u00b73 [16\u00b73] vs 11\u00b74 [16\u00b71]; p=0\u00b703), the mean change in ALDS scores (20\u00b73 [27\u00b71] vs 11\u00b78 [18\u00b79]; p=0\u00b704), and medication (mean levodopa equivalent drug reduction: 546 [SD 561] vs 208 [521]; p=0\u00b701). We recorded no difference in the occurrence of adverse events between the two groups. Other secondary endpoints showed no difference between the groups.\nAlthough there was no difference in our primary outcomes, our findings suggest that STN could be the preferred target for DBS in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.\nStichting Internationaal Parkinson Fonds, Prinses Beatrix Fonds, and Parkinson Vereniging.",

    "abstract": "Multidisciplinary care is considered an optimal model to manage Parkinson's disease (PD), but supporting evidence is limited. We performed a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to establish whether a multidisciplinary/specialist team offers better outcomes, compared to stand-alone care from a general neurologist. Patients with PD were randomly allocated to an intervention group (care from a movement disorders specialist, PD nurses, and social worker) or a control group (care from general neurologists). Both interventions lasted 8 months. Clinicians and researchers were blinded for group allocation. The primary outcome was the change in quality of life (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire; PDQ-39) from baseline to 8 months. Other outcomes were the UPDRS, depression (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale; MADRS), psychosocial functioning (Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease-Psychosocial; SCOPA-PS), and caregiver strain (Caregiver Strain Index; CSI). Group differences were analyzed using analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline values and presence of response fluctuations. A total of 122 patients were randomized and 100 completed the study (intervention, n = 51; control, n = 49). Compared to controls, the intervention group improved significantly on PDQ-39 (difference, 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5-6.2) and UPDRS motor scores (4.1; 95% CI: 0.8-7.3). UPDRS total score (5.6; 95% CI: 0.9-10.3), MADRS (3.7; 95% CI: 1.4-5.9), and SCOPA-PS (2.1; 95% CI: 0.5-3.7) also improved significantly. This RCT gives credence to a multidisciplinary/specialist team approach. We interpret these positive findings cautiously because of the limitations in study design. Further research is required to assess teams involving additional disciplines and to evaluate cost-effectiveness of integrated approaches. \u00a9 2012 Movement Disorder Society.",

Eight patients were bilaterally implanted in the cZi (ages 49-71 years; M = 60.8 years). Preoperative assessments were made after a levodopa challenge (approximately 1.5 times the ordinary dose). All postoperative examinations were made off and on stimulation with a clinically optimized dose of levodopa. Measurements of pitch range and variability were obtained from each utterance in a recorded read speech passage.\nPitch range and coefficient of variation showed an increase in patients under STN-DBS.

    "abstract": "We investigated the hypothesis that variation in endogenous dopamine (DA) across brain regions explains dissimilar effects of dopaminergic therapy on aspects of cognition in early Parkinson's disease (PD). Extensive degeneration of DA-producing cells in the substantia nigra cause dorsal striatum (DS) DA deficiency and movement abnormalities. Particularly in early PD, this contrasts with relative sparing of the dopaminergic cells of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The hypothesis predicts that DS-mediated cognitive functions are deficient at baseline and improved by DA replacement, whereas functions depending upon VTA-innervated brain regions are normal off medication and worsen with treatment. The latter pattern presumably owes to overdose of relatively DA-replete VTA-supplied brain regions with medication levels titrated to DS-mediated motor symptoms. As PD progresses, however, VTA degeneration increases. Impairment in cognitive operations performed by VTA-innervated brain regions, such as the ventral striatum (VS), is expected. We compared the performance of early and late PD patients, on and off dopaminergic medication, relative to age-matched controls, on reward learning, previously shown to implicate the VS. As expected, in early PD, stimulus-reward learning was normal off medication, but worsened with DA replacement. At more advanced disease stages, PD patients learned stimulus-reward contingencies more poorly than controls and early PD patients off medication. Furthermore, dopaminergic medication did not worsen reward learning in late PD patients, in line with the dopamine overdose hypothesis. Unlike its effect on DS-mediated functions, however, DA-replacement therapy did not improve reward learning in late PD patients.",

We recommend a stepwise approach with two levels of standardized evaluation to establish a common battery, as well as an alternative testing recommendation for severely impaired subjects, and review supplemental tests that may be useful in specific research settings. Our flexible approach may be applied to studies with varying emphasis on cognition and behavior, does not place undue burden on participants or resources, and has a high degree of compatibility with existing test batteries to promote collaboration.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the level of care of Parkinson's disease patients based on the 10 American Academy of Neurology quality measures. We reviewed 1,367 charts and final analysis was completed on 123 subjects. A total of 1,461 outpatient neurology visits from 33 neurologists were reviewed and 544 were included in the final analysis. Out of all 10 quality measures (13 individual questions addressed), \"annual review of Parkinson's medications\" was the most frequently documented (97.2%) and \"annual review of safety issues appropriate to the patient's stage of disease\" was the least frequently documented item (7.2%). Movement disorders specialists recorded significantly more items than other neurologists (4.7 \u00b1 2.86 vs 3.3 \u00b1 1.97, p = .0437); the provider with the highest number of items addressed was a movement disorders nurse practitioner (8.22 out of 13). None of the patient characteristics influenced the rates of documentation of the 10 quality measures. The wide variation of documentation rates could be addressed by comprehensive standardized templates to be reviewed and updated at each visit.",

    "abstract": "This mini-review summarizes the evidence of the cognitive and behavioral features of dysexecutive syndrome in Parkinson's disease (PD). Deficits in response inhibition, set-shifting, mental flexibility, and strategy have been frequently described from the earliest stages of PD, although there are inconsistencies in study findings due to the complexity of the executive function (EF) construct and methodological limitations. Behavioral disorders of PD, e.g., apathy, distractibility, perseverative behavior, and impulse-control disorders, may be viewed as the other side of dysexecutive syndrome. Despite the interrelationship between the cognitive and behavioral domains, some reports reveal that the two syndromes may be dissociated, suggesting that both aspects must be clinically assessed. EFs are widely associated with the prefrontal areas, although dysexecutive syndrome may be observed in patients with damage to other brain regions. EFs drive numerous abilities essential to daily life, such as prospective remembering and language comprehension, which may be impaired in PD subjects. Considering the impact of dysexecutive syndrome on independence and quality of life, early detection of executive impairment is crucial in the management of PD.",

    "abstract": "Mobile phones with built-in accelerometers promise a convenient, objective way to quantify everyday movements and classify those movements into activities. Using accelerometer data we estimate the following activities of 18 healthy subjects and eight patients with Parkinson's disease: walking, standing, sitting, holding, or not wearing the phone. We use standard machine learning classifiers (support vector machines, regularized logistic regression) to automatically select, weigh, and combine a large set of standard features for time series analysis. Using cross validation across all samples we are able to correctly identify 96.1% of the activities of healthy subjects and 92.2% of the activities of Parkinson's patients. However, when applying the classification parameters derived from the set of healthy subjects to Parkinson's patients, the percent correct lowers to 60.3%, due to different characteristics of movement. For a fairer comparison across populations we also applied subject-wise cross validation, identifying healthy subject activities with 86.0% accuracy and 75.1% accuracy for patients. We discuss the key differences between these populations, and why algorithms designed for and trained with healthy subject data are not reliable for activity recognition in populations with motor disabilities.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by abundant \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) neuronal inclusions, known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, and the massive loss of midbrain dopamine neurons. However, a cause-and-effect relationship between Lewy inclusion formation and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we found that in wild-type nontransgenic mice, a single intrastriatal inoculation of synthetic \u03b1-Syn fibrils led to the cell-to-cell transmission of pathologic \u03b1-Syn and Parkinson's-like Lewy pathology in anatomically interconnected regions. Lewy pathology accumulation resulted in progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, but not in the adjacent ventral tegmental area, and was accompanied by reduced dopamine levels culminating in motor deficits. This recapitulation of a neurodegenerative cascade thus establishes a mechanistic link between transmission of pathologic \u03b1-Syn and the cardinal features of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Figural fluency refers to the ability to internally generate appropriate non-verbal behaviour. Whereas deficits in verbal fluency rank among the most prominent cognitive sequelae in Parkinson's disease (PD), little is known about figural fluency and its assessment in PD. This is the first comprehensive comparison of the psychometric properties of figural fluency tasks in PD. PD patients (n = 22) and matched normal controls (n = 27) were compared in widely used figural fluency measures. The ability to assess PD-specific cognitive morbidity was assessed via comparison with a matched neurological sample of various aetiologies (n = 22). Construct validity was assessed by means of linear regression analyses of figural fluency measures and an extensive cognitive test battery. PD patients were impaired in all measures of figural fluency tasks. PD-specific impairments were identified regarding perseverative and strategic behaviour. Importantly, only perseverative, but not repetitive, behaviour was able to identify PD-specific cognitive morbidity. Quantitative fluency can be predicted by basic cognitive functions (e.g. visuospatial ability, visuomotor speed) as well as other measures of executive functioning. However, qualitative test scores, especially of the Five-Point Test (FPT), yield important and additional diagnostic information in PD. Qualitative test parameters of figural fluency measures, especially of the FPT, offer the unique possibility to assess PD-specific cognitive impairments in the areas of perseverative and strategic behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Impulse control disorders (ICDs) are frequent in Parkinson's disease (PD). Aim of the present study was to investigate cognition and behaviour in PD patients with and without ICDs, in order to identify potential early clinical features which might be associated to the development of ICDs. We recruited 17 PD patients with ICDs and 17 without ICDs, matched for several clinical variables, without clinically significant cognitive deficits. Assessments included behavioural scales and a neuropsychological battery, including the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). In patients with ICDs, the total score of the BIS and the Motor Impulsivity subscore were significantly higher than in patients without ICDs. In patients with ICDs, we observed only statistical trends towards a worse performance on neuropsychological tasks (go-no-go subtest of the Frontal Assessment Battery, oral verb naming task, copying of drawings with landmarks) sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction (FLD) and on the IGT (loss of a greater amount of money, more risky choices). As compared to patients without ICDs, they reported a more than threefold number of errors on the interference subtest of Stroop test, which is also sensitive to FLD. Although this study did not show any significant difference between PD patients presenting ICDs as compared with patients without ICDs on neuropsychological variables, some preliminary evidence was detected suggesting a trend toward a worse performance of the PD-ICD group on few neuropsychological tasks which are at least partially sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction, including tasks sensitive to dysfunction of ventral fronto-striatal loops.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder manifesting in motor, cognitive and behavioral anomalies. Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain is the hallmark feature of PD, which is attributed to oxidative and inflammatory stress besides other diverse factors and hence drugs targeting these pathways hold promise as neuro-therapeutics. The anti-oxidative as well as anti-inflammatory properties of sodium salicylate (SS), suggest its neuroprotective potentials in PD. Since PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, the mechanistic basis for utilizing SS as a neuroprotectant in PD could be better understood in the chronic models. The present study utilizes a rotenone-based model of PD to evaluate the neuro-modulatory efficacy of SS. Subcutaneous injection of rotenone (2mg/kg body weight) was given to male SD rats every day, for a period of 5 weeks, which developed all the essential features of PD in these animals. Simultaneously, another group was injected SS intraperitoneally at the dose of 100mg/kg body weight, in addition to the rotenone. In the animals receiving rotenone+SS, significant improvement was observed in the various characteristic hallmarks of PD such as dopamine and tyrosine hydroxylase levels as well as the motor dysfunction symptoms. It attenuated the reactive oxygen species levels significantly but failed to reduce the levels of protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation. However, SS effectively abridged the levels of inflammatory mediators like cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor kappa B and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Correspondingly, a significant decrease in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, interleukin-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 was also observed following SS co-treatment. Thus, neuroprotective efficacy of SS in this chronic model of PD can be largely attributed to its anti-inflammatory effects rather than its free radical-scavenging properties.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, which occurs mainly in the elderly. Recent studies have demonstrated that apoptosis plays an important role in the occurrence and development of PD. Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) has been recognized as an effective treatment for PD. Recent clinical observations have shown that STN-DBS was able to delay early PD progression, and experiments in animal models have also demonstrated a protective effect of STN-DBS on neurons. However, the correlation between the neuron-protective effect of STN-DBS and the progression of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) neuronal apoptosis is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect and potential mechanism of STN-DBS on SNc neurons in PD rats.\nAfter the establishment of a PD rat model by unilateral/2-point injection of 6-hydroxydopamine in the medial forebrain bundle of the brain, DBS by implanting electrodes in the STN was administered. Behavioral changes were observed, and morphological changes of SNc neurons were analyzed by Nissl staining and DNA in situ end-labeling. Through extracellular recording of single neuron discharges and microelectrophoresis, the causes of and changes in SNc excitability during STN-DBS were analyzed, and the protective effect and potential mechanism of action of STN-DBS on SNc neurons in PD rats was investigated.\nSNc neuron apoptosis was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the stimulation group, compared with the sham stimulation PD group. Spontaneous discharges of SNc neurons were observed in normal rats and PD model rats, and the mean frequency of spontaneous discharges of SNc neurons in normal rats ((40.65 \u00b1 11.08) Hz) was higher than that of residual SNc neurons in PD rats ((36.71 \u00b1 9.23) Hz). Electrical stimulation of the STN in rats was associated with elevated excitation in unilateral SNc neurons. However, administering the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor blocker, bicuculline significantly reduced SNc neuron excitation, but the change in SNc neuron excitation was not present when MK801, a glutamate receptor blocker, was administered.\nHigh-frequency stimulation of the STN has a protective effect on SNc neurons in PD rats. The possible molecular mechanism may be related to changes in the distribution and metabolism of neurotransmitters in the SNc region.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is highly effective neurosurgery for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), essential tremor (ET) and primary dystonia. DBS involves stereotactic surgical implantation of a battery-operated stimulator into deep brain nuclei. Irish patients are referred abroad for DBS and have to travel repeatedly for pre and post-operative care resulting in stress, anxiety and hardship. Safe pre and post-operative care of these complex, ageing patients is compromised by the absence of a DBS service in Ireland. Moreover, both DBS surgery and the subsequent post-operative care abroad incurs substantial cost to the state. The Dublin Neurological Institute at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (DNI) is a non-profit institute for the care of patients with neurological diseases. The DNI developed, in collaboration with the Mater Private Hospital (MPH) and the Walton Centre, Liverpool, a DBS programme in 2008/2009. We performed DBS at the Mater Campus on three carefully selected patients from a cohort of movement disorder patients attending the DNI and continue to provide pre-operative assessment and post operative care for patients following DBS in Ireland and abroad.",

Early recognition and treatment of constipation in PD patients may alter complications like sigmoid volvulus. Treatment of sigmoid volvulus in PD patients does not differ from other patients and involves endoscopic detorsion. If feasible, secondary sigmoidal resection should be performed. However, if the expected surgical morbidity and mortality is unacceptably high or if the patient refuses surgery, percutaneous endoscopic colostomy (PEC) should be considered. We describe an elderly PD patient who presented with sigmoid volvulus. She was treated conservatively with endoscopic detorsion. Surgery was consistently refused by the patient. After recurrence of the sigmoid volvulus a PEC was placed.",

    "abstract": "We investigated lower-extremity isometric tremor Approximate Entropy (irregularity), torque steadiness and rate of force development (RFD) and their associations to muscle activation strategy during isometric knee extensions in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Thirteen male patients with idiopathic PD and 15 neurologically healthy matched controls performed isometric maximal contractions (extension/flexion) as well as steady submaximal and powerful isometric knee extensions. The patients with PD showed decreased isometric tremor irregularity. Torque steadiness was reduced in PD and the patients had increased muscle coactivation. A markedly lower RFD was found in PD and the decreased RFD correlated with reduced agonist muscle activation. Furthermore, patient RFD correlated with the Movement-Disorder-Society-Unified-Parkinson's-Disease-Rating-Scale 3 (motor part) scores. We concluded that both knee isometric tremor Approximate Entropy and torque steadiness clearly differentiate between patients with PD and healthy controls. Furthermore, severely compromised RFD was found in patients with PD and was associated with decreased agonist muscle activation.",

    "abstract": "Many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease show similar characteristics. They typically show deposits of protein aggregates, the formation of which is considered important in their pathogenesis. Recently, aggregation-prone proteins have been shown to spread between cells and so may contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases like prion disease. Such a pathogenesis pathway is possibly common to many neurodegenerative diseases. If confirmed, it could allow the development of therapeutic interventions against many such diseases. In Parkinson disease, \u03b1-synuclein, a major component of cytosolic protein inclusions named Lewy body, has been shown to be released and taken up by cells, which may facilitate its progressive pathological spreading between cells. Accordingly, inhibition of spreading by targeting extracellular \u03b1-synuclein may represent a new therapy against Parkinson disease. Research into the intercellular spreading of extracellular protein aggregations of \u03b1-synuclein and its clearance pathway are reviewed here with a focus on the proteolytic clearance pathway as a therapeutic target for the treatment of Parkinson disease. Considering the similar characteristics of aggregation-prone proteins, these clearance systems might allow treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases beyond Parkinson disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, which arises from a yet elusive concurrence between genetic and environmental factors. The protein \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn), the principle toxic effector in PD, has been shown to interfere with neuronal Ca(2+) fluxes, arguing for an involvement of deregulated Ca(2+) homeostasis in this neuronal demise. Here, we identify the Golgi-resident Ca(2+)/Mn(2+) ATPase PMR1 (plasma membrane-related Ca(2+)-ATPase 1) as a phylogenetically conserved mediator of \u03b1Syn-driven changes in Ca(2+) homeostasis and cytotoxicity. Expression of \u03b1Syn in yeast resulted in elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) levels and increased cell death, both of which could be inhibited by deletion of PMR1. Accordingly, absence of PMR1 prevented \u03b1Syn-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons in nematodes and flies. In addition, \u03b1Syn failed to compromise locomotion and survival of flies when PMR1 was absent. In conclusion, the \u03b1Syn-driven rise of cytosolic Ca(2+) levels is pivotal for its cytotoxicity and requires PMR1.",

    "abstract": "Elevation of serum uric acid (UA) is correlated with a decreased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the association and clinical relevance of serum UA levels in patients with PD and vascular parkinsonism (VP) are unknown.\nWe performed a cross-sectional study of 160 Chinese patients with PD and VP to determine whether UA levels in patients could predict the outcomes.\nSerum UA levels were divided into quartiles and the association between UA and the severity of PD or VP was investigated in each quartile.\nThe serum levels of UA in PD were significantly lower than those in normal subjects and VP. The serum UA levels in PD patients were significantly correlated with some clinical parameters. Strong correlations were observed in male PD patients, but significant correlations were observed only between UA and the non-motor symptoms (NMS) of burden of sleep/fatigue and mood in female PD patients. PD patients in the lowest quartile of serum UA levels had significant correlations between UA and the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale, the modified Hoehn and Yahr staging scale and NMS burden for attention/memory.\nOur findings support the hypothesis that subjects with low serum UA levels may be more prone to developing PD and indicate that the inverse relationship between UA and severity of PD was robust for men but weak for women. Our results strongly imply that either low serum UA level is a deteriorative predictor or that serum UA level serves as an indirect biomarker of prediction in PD but not in VP patients.",

    "conclusions": "Our findings support the hypothesis that subjects with low serum UA levels may be more prone to developing PD and indicate that the inverse relationship between UA and severity of PD was robust for men but weak for women. Our results strongly imply that either low serum UA level is a deteriorative predictor or that serum UA level serves as an indirect biomarker of prediction in PD but not in VP patients.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment, including impairment of episodic memory, is frequently found in newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease (PD). In this longitudinal observational study we investigated whether performance in memory encoding, retention, recognition and free recall is associated with reduced hippocampal radial distance.\nWe analysed baseline T1-weighted brain MRI data from 114 PD subjects without cognitive impairment, 29 PD subjects with mild cognitive impairment and 99 normal controls from the ParkWest study. Age- and education-predicted scores for the California Verbal Learning Test 2 (CVLT-2) and tests of executive function were regressed against hippocampal radial distance while adjusting for imaging centre.\nThere was no association between encoding or performance on executive tests and hippocampal atrophy in the PD group. In the full PD sample we found bilaterally significant associations between lower delayed free recall scores and hippocampal atrophy in the CA1, CA3 and subiculum area (left, p=0.0013; right, p=0.0082). CVLT-2 short delay free recall scores were associated with bilateral hippocampal CA1 and subicular atrophy in the full PD sample (left, p=0.013; right, p=0.047). CVLT-2 recognition scores showed a significant association with right-sided subicular and CA1 atrophy in the full PD sample (p=0.043).\nAt the time of PD diagnosis, subjects' verbal memory performance in recall and recognition are associated with atrophy of the hippocampus, while encoding is not associated with hippocampal radial distance. We postulate that impaired recall and recognition might reflect deficient memory consolidation at least partly due to structural hippocampal changes.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have identified a number of susceptibility loci in sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent larger studies and meta-analyses have greatly expanded the list of proposed association signals. We performed a case-control replication study in a Scandinavian population, analyzing samples from 1345 unrelated PD patients and 1225 control subjects collected by collaborating centers in Norway and Sweden. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms representing 18 loci previously reported at genome-wide significance levels were genotyped, as well as 4 near-significant, suggestive, loci. We replicated 11 association signals at p < 0.05 (SNCA, STK39, MAPT, GPNMB, CCDC62/HIP1R, SYT11, GAK, STX1B, MCCC1/LAMP3, ACMSD, and FGF20). The more recently nominated susceptibility loci were well represented among our positive findings, including 3 which have not previously been validated in independent studies. Conversely, some of the more well-established loci failed to replicate. While future meta-analyses should corroborate disease associations further on the level of common markers, efforts to pinpoint functional variants and understand the biological implications of each risk locus in PD are also warranted.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, is etiologically heterogeneous, with most cases thought to arise from a combination of environmental factors and genetic predisposition; about 10% of cases are caused by single gene mutations. While neurotoxin models replicate many of the key behavioral and neurological features, they often have limited relevance to human exposures. Genetic models replicate known disease-causing mutations, but are mostly unsuccessful in reproducing major features of PD. In this study, we created a BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) transgenic rat model of PD expressing the E46K mutation of \u03b1-synuclein, which is pathogenic in humans. The mutant protein was expressed at levels ~2-3-fold above endogenous \u03b1-synuclein levels. At 12 months of age, there was no overt damage to the nigrostriatal dopamine system; however, (i) alterations in striatal neurotransmitter metabolism, (ii) accumulation and aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein in nigral dopamine neurons, and (iii) evidence of oxidative stress suggest this model replicates several preclinical features of PD. Further, when these animals were exposed to rotenone, a mitochondrial toxin linked to PD, they showed heightened sensitivity, indicating that \u03b1-synuclein expression modulates the vulnerability to mitochondrial impairment. We conclude that these animals are well-suited to examination of gene-environment interactions that are relevant to PD.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, neuroimaging has been increasingly used as an objective method for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Most previous studies were based on invasive imaging modalities or on a single modality which was not an ideal diagnostic tool. In this study, we developed a non-invasive technology intended for use in the diagnosis of early PD by integrating the advantages of various modals.\nNineteen early PD patients and twenty-seven normal volunteers participated in this study. For each subject, we collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and structural images. For the rsfMRI images, we extracted the characteristics at three different levels: ALFF (amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations), ReHo (regional homogeneity) and RFCS (regional functional connectivity strength). For the structural images, we extracted the volume characteristics from the gray matter (GM), the white matter (WM) and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A two-sample t-test was used for the feature selection, and then the remaining features were fused for classification. Finally a classifier for early PD patients and normal control subjects was identified from support vector machine training. The performance of the classifier was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation method.\nUsing the proposed methods to classify the data set, good results (accuracy \u200a=\u200a86.96%, sensitivity \u200a=\u200a78.95%, specificity \u200a=\u200a92.59%) were obtained.\nThis method demonstrates a promising diagnosis performance by the integration of information from a variety of imaging modalities, and it shows potential for improving the clinical diagnosis and treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. However, the etiology of PD remains largely unknown. Macroautophagy is known to play an essential role in the degradation of abnormal proteins and organelles. Furthermore, the loss of autophagy-related (Atg) genes results in neurodegeneration and abnormal protein accumulation. Since these are also pathologic features of Parkinson's disease, the conditional impairment of autophagy may lead to improved animal models for the study of PD. Using transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of either the dopamine transporter or the engrailed-1 promoters, we generated mice with the conditional deletion of Atg7 in the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, other regions of the midbrain, and also the hindbrain. This conditional impairment of autophagy results in the age-related loss of dopaminergic neurons and corresponding loss of striatal dopamine, the accumulation of low-molecular-weight \u03b1-synuclein, and the presence of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, recapitulating many of the pathologic features of PD. These conditional knock-out animals provide insight into the process of autophagy in Parkinson's disease pathology.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether evidence of neuronal dysfunction or demise preceded deposition of Lewy pathology in vulnerable neurons in Parkinson disease (PD).\nWe examined the extent of nigral dysfunction and degeneration among 63 normal, incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD), and PD cases based on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity and neuron densities, respectively. The relationship between these markers and Lewy pathology (LP) burden in the substantia nigra (SN) and Braak PD stage was assessed.\nCompared with normal subjects, ILBD cases displayed a significantly higher percentage of TH-negative cells and lower neuronal densities in the SN as early as Braak PD stages 1 and 2, before LP deposition in the nigrostriatal system. ILBD nigral neuron densities were intermediate between normal subjects and PD cases, and TH-negative percentages were higher in ILBD than either normal or PD cases. Furthermore, neuron density and neuronal dysfunction levels remained relatively constant across Braak PD stages in ILBD.\nThese results suggest that significant neurodegeneration and cellular dysfunction precede LP in the SN, challenging the pathogenic role of LP in PD and the assumption that ILBD always represents preclinical PD.",

Differences in age, age at PD onset, disease duration, years from PD onset to Hoehn and Yahr stage 5, cognitive state, the levodopa equivalent dose (LED) for dopaminergic drugs, and rigidity of the neck and upper and lower extremities were examined to determine the clinical correlates of abnormal neck posture. We also evaluated retrocollis in 356 patients with PD at Hoehn and Yahr stage 1, 2, 3, and 4 and 65 age matched normal controls.\nOf the 74 patients with PD at Hoehn and Yahr stage 5 examined, 21 (28.4%) had retrocollis, 3 (4.1%) had antecollis, and 1 (1.4%) had antecollis and torticollis. Whereas, only one patient had retrocollis in PD patients at Hoehn and Yahr stage 4 and under. Patients with antecollis were significantly younger than those with normal neck posture and retrocollis. There were no differences in age at PD onset, disease duration, sex, years from PD motor symptom onset to Hoehn and Yahr stage 5, cognitive state, or LED between patients with and without abnormal neck postures. Neck rigidity scores were significantly higher in patients with retrocollis and antecollis than in those with normal neck posture.\nRetrocollis is not rare in patients with PD at Hoehn and Yahr stage 5, and the incidence appeared to increase as axial rigidity increased.",

    "abstract": "Gait deficits are important clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, existing behavioral tests for the detection of motor impairments in rodents with systemic dopamine depletion only measure akinesia and dyskinesia, and data focusing on gait are scarce. We evaluated gait changes in the methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced C57BL/6 murine model of PD by using a computer-assisted CatWalk system. Correlations of gait parameters with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein levels in the substantia nigra (SN) were also investigated.\nThe gait readouts, including the walking duration, variation of walking speed, step cycle, duty cycle, stance, initial dual stance, terminal dual stance, three- and four-point supports, and the base of support between hind limbs was noted to increase significantly one week after MPTP injection. In contrast, values of the stride length, cadence, swing speed, and diagonal dual support decreased substantially following MPTP treatment (p < 0.05). All of these changes lasted for three weeks after the last MPTP administration. Except for the stance in the fore limbs and the swing speed in the hind limbs, the gait variability in the PD mice showed a closer correlation with the protein levels of TH in the SN than the walking distances in the conventional open field test. Coordination parameters of the regularity index and step pattern were not affected in mice treated with MPTP.\nData of the study suggest that the computer-assisted CatWalk system can provide reliable and objective criteria to stratify gait changes arising from MPTP-induced bilateral lesions in C57/BL6 mice. The extent of gait changes was noted to correlate with the expression of the biomarker for dopaminergic neurons. This novel analytical method may hold promise in the study of disease progression and new drug screening in a murine PD model.",

    "results": "The gait readouts, including the walking duration, variation of walking speed, step cycle, duty cycle, stance, initial dual stance, terminal dual stance, three- and four-point supports, and the base of support between hind limbs was noted to increase significantly one week after MPTP injection. In contrast, values of the stride length, cadence, swing speed, and diagonal dual support decreased substantially following MPTP treatment (p < 0.05). All of these changes lasted for three weeks after the last MPTP administration. Except for the stance in the fore limbs and the swing speed in the hind limbs, the gait variability in the PD mice showed a closer correlation with the protein levels of TH in the SN than the walking distances in the conventional open field test. Coordination parameters of the regularity index and step pattern were not affected in mice treated with MPTP.",

    "abstract": "The growing literature on driving in Parkinson disease (PD) has shown that driving is impaired in PD compared to healthy comparison drivers. PD is a complex neurodegenerative disorder leading to motor, cognitive, and visual impairments, all of which can affect fitness to drive. In this review, we examined studies of driving performance (on-road tests and simulators) in PD for outcome measures and their predictors. We searched through various databases and found 25 (of 99) primary studies, all published in English. Using the American Academy of Neurology criteria, a study class of evidence was assigned (I-IV, I indicating the highest level of evidence) and recommendations were made (Level A: predictive or not; B: probably predictive or not; C: possibly predictive or not; U: no recommendations). From available Class II and III studies, we identified various cognitive, visual, and motor measures that met different levels of evidence (usually Level B or C) with respect to predicting on-road and simulated driving performance. Class I studies reporting Level A recommendations for definitive predictors of driving performance in drivers with PD are needed by policy makers and clinicians to develop evidence-based guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) increased risk of Parkinson disease (PD) in many but not all epidemiologic studies, giving rise to speculations about modifying factors. A recent animal study suggested that the combination of TBI with subthreshold paraquat exposure increases dopaminergic neurodegeneration. The objective of our study was to investigate PD risk due to both TBI and paraquat exposure in humans.\nFrom 2001 to 2011, we enrolled 357 incident idiopathic PD cases and 754 population controls in central California. Study participants were asked to report all head injuries with loss of consciousness for >5 minutes. Paraquat exposure was assessed via a validated geographic information system (GIS) based on records of pesticide applications to agricultural crops in California since 1974. This GIS tool assesses ambient pesticide exposure within 500 m of residences and workplaces.\nIn logistic regression analyses, we observed a 2-fold increase in risk of PD for subjects who reported a TBI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-3.14) and a weaker association for paraquat exposures (AOR 1.36, 95% CI 1.02-1.81). However, the risk of developing PD was 3-fold higher (AOR 3.01, 95% CI 1.51-6.01) in study participants with a TBI and exposure to paraquat than those exposed to neither risk factor.\nWhile TBI and paraquat exposure each increase the risk of PD moderately, exposure to both factors almost tripled PD risk. These environmental factors seem to act together to increase PD risk in a more than additive manner.",

    "abstract": "Delusional jealousy (DJ) has been described in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) on dopaminergic therapy, but a role for dopaminergic therapy in DJ has not been established.\nThe current cross-sectional study on DJ investigated its association with dopaminergic therapies compared with their associations with hallucinations and its prevalence in PD patients. Eight hundred five consecutive patients with PD were enrolled between January 2009 and June 2010.\nDJ was identified in 20 patients (2.48%) and hallucinations in 193 patients (23.98%).

    "abstract": "Several studies demonstrated reduced CSF \u03b1-synuclein values in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Values in drug-na\u00efve PD subjects and healthy controls (HC) have not yet been reported. We measured CSF values including \u03b1-synuclein in a cohort of 78 previously untreated PD patients and 48 HC subjects. Measurements of total \u03b1-synuclein concentrations were performed using two independently operated immunoassays, i.e., one academia-based and previously validated (ELISA 1), the other industry-based, renewable and commercially available (ELISA 2). Mean values for CSF \u03b1-synuclein were significantly lower in de novo PD patients when compared to HC subjects, as demonstrated by both assays (ELISA 1, p=0.049; ELISA 2, p=0.005; combined, p=0.002). Using the renewable ELISA 2, CSF \u03b1-synuclein concentrations of 1884.31 pg/ml or less showed a sensitivity of 0.91 and a specificity of 0.25 for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The corresponding area-under-the-curve value was 0.65 (confidence interval, 0.554-0.750), which was statistically significant (p=0.004). Total CSF \u03b1-synuclein is reduced early in the course of Parkinson's disease, as measured by two independent ELISA platforms at the time of enrolment, and this reduction appears independent from drug treatment. Follow-up investigations will determine the usefulness of CSF \u03b1-synuclein values as markers of progression in individual subjects.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has broadly been associated with mild cognitive impairment (PDMCI) and dementia (PDD). Researchers have studied surrogate, neuroanatomic biomarkers provided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that may help in the early diagnosis of this condition. In this article, four classification models (na\u00efve Bayes, multivariate filter-based na\u00efve Bayes, filter selective na\u00efve Bayes and support vector machines, SVM) have been applied to evaluate their capacity to discriminate between cognitively intact patients with Parkinson's disease (PDCI), PDMCI and PDD. For this purpose, the MRI studies of 45 subjects (16 PDCI, 15 PDMCI and 14 PDD) were acquired and post-processed with Freesurfer, obtaining 112 variables (volumes of subcortical structures and thickness of cortical parcels) per subject. A multivariate filter-based na\u00efve Bayes model was found to be the best classifier, having the highest cross-validated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Additionally, the most relevant variables related to dementia in PD, as predicted by our classifiers, were cerebral white matter, and volumes of the lateral ventricles and hippocampi.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammatory processes have been shown to be a key component of this neurodegeneration and, as such, small molecule compounds which inhibit these inflammatory events are a critical research focus.\nCNI-1493 is an anti-inflammatory compound that strongly inhibits macrophages and also stimulates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. We have examined whether CNI-1493 has a neuroprotective effect in the acute 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD.\nCNI-1493 (8 mg/kg i.p.) or placebo administration was started 1 day before MPTP intoxication and repeated daily until sacrifice after MPTP intoxication. C57/Bl6 mice - either treated with CNI-1493 or with placebo - were injected intraperitoneally 4 times at 2-hour intervals with either 20 mg/kg MPTP-HCl or a corresponding volume of saline. Two or 7 days after the end of the MPTP intoxication, the animals were killed and their brains were processed for further analysis.\nAdministration of CNI-1493 markedly protected tyrosine hydroxylase-positive substantia nigra neurons against MPTP neurotoxicity. CNI-1493 treatment in the MPTP model was also accompanied by a profound reduction of activated microglia within the substantia nigra, as measured by ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 staining.\nThese findings support that CNI-1493 could reduce the MPTP-induced toxicity likely by inhibition of neuroinflammatory responses. The neuroprotective effect of CNI-1493 suggests that CNI-1493 might be a valuable neuroprotective candidate in the future treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Color discrimination deficit is a common nonmotor manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the pathophysiology of this dysfunction remains poorly understood. Although retinal structure changes found in PD have been suggested to cause color discrimination deficits, the impact of cognitive impairment and cortical alterations remains to be determined. We investigated the contribution of cognitive impairment to color discrimination deficits in PD and correlated them with cortical anomalies. Sixty-six PD patients without dementia and 20 healthy controls performed the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test and underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment for mild cognitive impairment diagnosis. In a subgroup of 26 PD patients, we also used high-definition neuroanatomical magnetic resonance imaging for cortical thickness and diffusion tensor analysis. PD patients with mild cognitive impairment performed poorly on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test compared with PD patients without mild cognitive impairment and controls. In PD patients, performance on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test was correlated with measures of visuospatial abilities and executive functions. Neuroimaging analysis revealed higher mean and radial diffusivity values in right posterior white-matter structures that correlated with poor performance on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test. No cortical thickness correlation reached significance. This study showed that cognitive impairment makes a major contribution to the color discrimination deficits reported in PD. Thus, performance on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test may reflect cognitive impairment more than color discrimination deficits in PD. Poor performance on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test was also associated with white-matter alterations in right posterior brain regions.",

    "abstract": "A patient with a history of Parkinson's disease and severe bilateral peripheral vision loss due to vitreous hemorrhages had complex visual hallucinations that persisted for three days and appeared every morning on awakening. The persistent nature of these hallucinations, the patient's preserved insight, and the presence of severe visual impairment was suggestive for Charles Bonnet syndrome rather than Parkinson-related hallucinations. A treatment with carbamazepine was started and proved to be successful. Physicians treating Parkinson patients should be familiar with Charles Bonnet syndrome and consider it as a potential alternative etiology for visual hallucinations, especially when the patient has severely impaired vision and when the hallucinations are sustained during wakefulness.",

    "abstract": "Nocebo refers to adverse events (AEs) generated by patient's negative expectations that medical treatment will likely harm instead of heal and can be assessed in placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Of 3544 placebo-treated patients, 64.7% (95% CI: 53.6-74.4) reported at least one AE and 8.8% (95% CI: 6.8-11.5) discontinued placebo treatment due to intolerance.

    "abstract": "Electrode implantation into the subthalamic nucleus for deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a temporary motor improvement occurring prior to neurostimulation. We studied this phenomenon by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) when considering the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) and collateral oedema. Twelve patients with PD (age 55.9\u00b1 (SD)6.8 years, PD duration 9-15 years) underwent bilateral electrode implantation into the subthalamic nucleus. The fMRI was carried out after an overnight withdrawal of levodopa (OFF condition): (i) before and (ii) within three days after surgery in absence of neurostimulation. The motor task involved visually triggered finger tapping. The OFF/UPDRS-III score dropped from 33.8\u00b18.7 before to 23.3\u00b14.8 after the surgery (p<0.001), correlating with the postoperative oedema score (p<0.05). During the motor task, bilateral activation of the thalamus and basal ganglia, motor cortex and insula were preoperatively higher than after surgery (p<0.001). The results became more enhanced after compensation for the oedema and UPDRS-III scores. In addition, the rigidity and axial symptoms score correlated inversely with activation of the putamen and globus pallidus (p<0.0001). One month later, the OFF/UPDRS-III score had returned to the preoperative level (35.8\u00b17.0, p = 0.4).In conclusion, motor improvement induced by insertion of an inactive electrode into the subthalamic nucleus caused an acute microlesion which was at least partially related to the collateral oedema and associated with extensive impact on the motor network. This was postoperatively manifested as lowered movement-related activation at the cortical and subcortical levels and differed from the known effects of neurostimulation or levodopa. The motor system finally adapted to the microlesion within one month as suggested by loss of motor improvement and good efficacy of deep brain stimulation.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) increases with age. Up to 50% of PD show cognitive decline in terms of a mild cognitive impairment already in early stages that predict the development of dementia, which can occur in up to 80% of PD patients over the long term, called Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). So far, diagnosis of PD/PDD is made according to clinical and neuropsychological examinations while laboratory data is only used for exclusion of other diseases. The aim of this study was the identification of possible biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PD, PDD and controls (CON) which predict the development of dementia in PD. For this, a proteomic approach optimized for CSF was performed using 18 clinically well characterized patients in a first step with subsequent validation using 84 patients. Here, we detected differentially sialylated isoforms of Serpin A1 as marker for differentiation of PD versus PDD in CSF. Performing 2D-immunoblots, all PDD patients could be identified correctly (sensitivity 100%). Ten out of 24 PD patients showed Serpin A1 isoforms in a similar pattern like PDD, indicating a specificity of 58% for the test-procedure. In control samples, no additional isoform was detected. On the basis of these results, we conclude that differentially sialylated products of Serpin A1 are an interesting biomarker to indicate the development of a dementia during the course of PD.",

    "abstract": "Palliative care is increasingly offered earlier in the cancer trajectory but rarely in Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease(IPD), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy(PSP) or Multiple System Atrophy(MSA). There is little longitudinal data of people with late stage disease to understand levels of need. We aimed to determine how symptoms and quality of life of these patients change over time; and what demographic and clinical factors predicted changes.\nWe recruited 82 patients into a longitudinal study, consenting patients with a diagnosis of IPD, MSA or PSP, stages 3-5 Hoehn and Yahr(H&Y). At baseline and then on up to 3 occasions over one year, we collected self-reported demographic, clinical, symptom, palliative and quality of life data, using Parkinson's specific and generic validated scales, including the Palliative care Outcome Scale (POS). We tested for predictors using multivariable analysis, adjusting for confounders.\nOver two thirds of patients had severe disability, over one third being wheelchair-bound/bedridden. Symptoms were highly prevalent in all conditions - mean (SD) of 10.6(4.0) symptoms. More than 50% of the MSA and PSP patients died over the year. Over the year, half of the patients showed either an upward (worsening, 24/60) or fluctuant (8/60) trajectory for POS and symptoms. The strongest predictors of higher levels of symptoms at the end of follow-up were initial scores on POS (AOR 1.30; 95%CI:1.05-1.60) and being male (AOR 5.18; 95% CI 1.17 to 22.92), both were more predictive than initial H&Y scores.\nThe findings point to profound and complex mix of non-motor and motor symptoms in patients with late stage IPD, MSA and PSP. Symptoms are not resolved and half of the patients deteriorate. Palliative problems are predictive of future symptoms, suggesting that an early palliative assessment might help screen for those in need of earlier intervention.",

    "abstract": "Ceruloplasmin (Cp) concentration and oxidative activity in serum are lowered in Parkinson's disease (PD). In most PD patients, iron increases in the substantia nigra in the midbrain. In PD, the low Cp concentration and activity in serum and the high iron amounts in the substantia nigra appears to be correlated. An hereditary background is common in PD and variations in the Cp gene that have been found in PD are associated with high iron levels in the substantia nigra. Variations in Cp synthesis and in the incorporation of copper into the Cp molecule are essential features of PD. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the Cp activity in serum is lowered but not the concentration, except in the advanced stages of the disease. Generally, iron is not increased in the AD brain. In the AD brain, iron accumulates in neuritic plaques and in neurofibrillary tangles. There is also increased risk of iron-mediated tissue damage, which may possibly be counteracted by Cp. At the same time, the AD brain is short in copper, which presumably results in the deficient activity of many copper enzymes in the brain, in addition to Cp. Lowered Cp activity in serum most likely stems from lessened incorporation of copper in the Cp molecule and similar incorporation defects might also apply to other copper enzymes in AD.",

    "abstract": "Variability in severity and progression of Parkinson's disease symptoms makes it challenging to design therapy interventions that provide maximal benefit. Previous studies showed that forced cycling, at greater pedaling rates, results in greater improvements in motor function than voluntary cycling. The precise mechanism for differences in function following exercise is unknown. We examined the complexity of biomechanical and physiological features of forced and voluntary cycling and correlated these features to improvements in motor function as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Heart rate, cadence, and power were analyzed using entropy signal processing techniques. Pattern variability in heart rate and power were greater in the voluntary group when compared to forced group. In contrast, variability in cadence was higher during forced cycling. UPDRS Motor III scores predicted from the pattern variability data were highly correlated to measured scores in the forced group. This study shows how time series analysis methods of biomechanical and physiological parameters of exercise can be used to predict improvements in motor function. This knowledge will be important in the development of optimal exercise-based rehabilitation programs for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Reduced dopamine input to cortical and subcortical brain structures, particularly those in the sensorimotor network, is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). The extent to which dopamine dysfunction affects connectivity within this and other brain networks remains to be investigated. The purpose of this study was to measure anatomical and functional connectivity in groups of PD patients and controls to determine whether connectivity deficits within the cortico-basal ganglia thalamocortical system could be attributed to PD, particularly in sensorimotor connections. A neuroimaging paradigm involving diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resting-state functional MRI was implemented in a large cohort of PD patients and control subjects. Probabilistic tractography and functional correlation analyses were performed to map connections between brain structures and to derive indices of connectivity that were then used to compare groups. Anatomical connectivity deficits were demonstrated in PD patients, specifically for sensorimotor connections. Functional deficits were also found in some of the same connections. In addition, functional connectivity was found to increase in associative and limbic connections in PD patients compared with controls. This study lends support to findings regarding the dysfunction of the sensorimotor circuit in PD. As deficits in anatomical and functional connectivity within this circuit were in some cases concordant in PD patients, a possible link between brain structure and function is suggested. Increases in functional connectivity in other cortico-basal ganglia thalamocortical circuits may be indicative of compensatory effects in response to system deficits elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "Dementia is an important consequence of Parkinson's disease (PD), with few known modifiable risk factors. Cumulative exposure to lead, at levels experienced in the community, may exacerbate PD-related neural dysfunction, resulting in impaired cognition. Among 101 persons with PD (\"cases\") and, separately, 50 persons without PD (\"controls\"), we evaluated cumulative lead exposure, gauged by tibia and patella bone lead concentrations, in relation to cognitive function, assessed using a telephone battery developed and validated in a separate sample of PD patients. We also assessed the interaction between lead and case-control status. After multivariable adjustment, higher tibia bone lead concentration among PD cases was associated with worse performance on all of the individual telephone tests. In particular, tibia lead levels corresponded to significantly worse performance on a telephone analog of the Mini-Mental State Examination and tests of working memory and attention. Moreover, higher tibia bone lead concentration was associated with significantly worse global composite score encompassing all the cognitive tests (P = 0.04). The magnitude of association per standard deviation increment in tibia bone lead level was equivalent to the difference in global scores among controls in our study, who were approximately 7 years apart in age. The tibia lead-cognition association was notably stronger within cases than within controls (P(difference) = 0.06). Patella bone lead concentration was not consistently associated with performance on the tests. These data provide evidence suggesting that cumulative exposure to lead may result in worsened cognition among persons with PD.",

To explore the relationships between polymorphisms of the HLA-DR region and sporadic PD in Chinese Han population, we genotyped 567 sporadic PD patients and 746 healthy controls in two independent series for the HLA-DRB1 locus with Polymerase chain reaction-sequence based typing(PCR-SBT). The \u03c7(2) test was used to evaluate the distribution of allele frequencies between the patients and healthy controls. The impact of HLA-DRB1 alleles on PD risk was estimated by unconditional logistic regression. We found a significant higher frequency of HLA-DRB1*0301 in sporadic PD patients than in healthy controls and a positive association, which was independent of onset age, between HLA-DRB1*0301 and PD risk. Conversely, a lower frequency of HLA-DRB1*0406 was found in sporadic PD patients than in healthy controls, with a negative association between HLA-DRB1*0406 and PD risk. Furthermore, a meta-analysis involving 195205 individuals was conducted to summarize the frequencies of these two alleles in populations from various ethnic regions, we found a higher frequency of HLA-DRB1*0301, but a lower frequency of HLA-DRB1*0406 in European ancestry populations than that in Asians, this was consistent with the higher prevalence of sporadic PD in European ancestry populations. Based on these results, we speculate that HLA-DRB1 alleles are associated with the susceptibility to sporadic PD in Chinese Han population, among them HLA-DRB1*0301 is a risk allele while the effect of HLA-DRB1*0406 deserves debate.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that people with Parkinson disease (PD) have difficulty performing the sit-to-stand task because of mobility and stability-related impairments. Despite its importance, literature on the quantification of dynamic stability control in people with PD during this task is limited.\nThe study objective was to examine differences in dynamic stability control between people with PD and people who were healthy and the extent to which externally cued training could improve such control during the sit-to-stand task in people with PD.\nThis was a quasi-experimental controlled trial.\nThe performance of 21 people with PD was compared with that of 12 older adults who dwelled in the community. People with PD were randomly assigned to 2 groups: a group that did not receive training and a group that received audiovisually cued training (3 times per week for 4 weeks) for speeding up performance on the sit-to-stand task. Outcome measures recorded at baseline and after 4 weeks included center-of-mass position, center-of-mass velocity, and stability against either backward or forward balance loss (backward or forward stability) at seat-off and movement termination.\nCompared with people who were healthy, people with PD had greater backward stability resulting from a more anterior center-of-mass position at seat-off. This feature, combined with decreased forward stability at movement termination, increased their risk of forward balance loss at movement termination. After training, people with PD achieved greater backward stability through increased forward center-of-mass velocity at seat-off and reduced the likelihood of forward balance loss at movement termination through a posterior shift in the center-of-mass position.\nThe study applied stability limits derived from adults who were healthy to people with PD, and the suggested impact on the risk of balance loss and falling is based on these theoretical stability limits.\nFor people with PD, postural stability against backward balance loss at task initiation was increased at the expense of possible forward balance loss at task termination. Task-specific training with preparatory audiovisual cues resulted in improved overall dynamic stability against both forward and backward balance loss.",

    "abstract": "Normal subjects show an increase of sleepiness in the morning, early afternoon and before sleep. In the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) the mean level of sleepiness is quite high, while with respect to healthy subjects it seems to be unchanged in the early stages. The aim of this study was to evaluate the time-course of the sleepiness level during the wakefulness period in untreated patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease. Eighteen Parkinson's disease patients who had never been treated before with dopaminergic drugs (male\u00a0=\u00a09, female\u00a0=\u00a09, age: 68.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.89, mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard error) and 18 healthy subjects (male\u00a0=\u00a09, female\u00a0=\u00a09, age: 67.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.98) were recruited for this study. All subjects underwent continuous actigraphic recording for three consecutive days, during which they also completed the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) once an hour throughout wakefulness. Our results showed a higher level of sleepiness in the patients than the controls in the hours following awakening and in the early afternoon, specifically at 08:00 and 14:00\u00a0hours (08:00\u00a0hours, PD patients, KSS: 3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 versus healthy subjects, KSS: 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05; 14:00\u00a0hours, PD patients, KSS: 4.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 versus healthy subjects, KSS: 3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). We suggest that some daytime hours are sensitive windows showing the first increase of sleepiness which will spread later to the whole daytime.",

    "abstract": "The motor examination section of the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) is widely used in research but few studies have examined whether subscales exist that tap relatively distinct motor abnormalities. We analyzed data from 193 persons enrolled in a population-based study in Central California. Patients were examined after overnight PD medication washout (\"OFF\" state) and approximately one hour after taking medication (\"ON\" state). We performed confirmatory factor analysis of the UPDRS for OFF and ON state examinations; correlations, reliability, and relative validity of resulting subscales were evaluated. A model with five factors (gait/posture, tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia affecting the left extremities, bradykinesia affecting the right extremities) fit the data well, with similar results for OFF and ON states. Internal consistency reliability coefficients were 0.90 or higher for all subscales. The gait/posture subscale most strongly discriminated across levels of patient reported PD symptom severity and of how PD affects them on a daily basis. Compared to the right sided bradykinesia subscale, the left sided bradykinesia subscale had higher discrimination across levels of self-reported PD symptom severity and functional impairment. This supports motor UPDRS containing multiple subscales that can be analyzed separately and provide information distinct from the total score that may be useful in clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Conventional swallowing therapy for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and swallowing difficulties has poor carryover to everyday life. Herein, we test the effectiveness of visual information while treating swallowing disturbances in patients with PD.\nForty two non-demented PD patients with swallowing disturbances were randomly divided into two groups. An experimental group received video-assisted swallowing therapy (VAST) and a control group (n = 21) was given conventional therapy. Both groups were given 6 interventional sessions by the same speech and swallowing therapist. Patients in the VAST group were exposed to video of the swallowing process in general as well as of their own, as part of all therapy sessions. Swallowing function was assessed before and post-intervention by fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Quality of life, quality of care and the degree of pleasure from eating were also assessed by questioners pre and post-intervention.\nThere was a significant improvement in swallowing functions following both interventions. The FEESs demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in food residues in the pharynx in the VAST group compared to the conventional treatment group. There were significant group improvement in some parameters of the quality of life, quality of care and pleasure of eating scales.\nIn cognitively intact patients with PD with swallowing disturbances VAST was associated with improved swallowing related QOL and less food residues in the pharynx.",

    "abstract": "The most prominent pathological feature in Parkinson's disease (PD) is the progressive and selective loss of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal tract. The present study was conducted in order to investigate whether naive and or genetically modified neural stem/precursor cells (NPCs) can survive, differentiate and functionally integrate in the lesioned striatum. To this end, stereotaxic injections of 6-OHDA in the right ascending nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway of mice and subsequent NPC transplantations were performed, followed by apomorphine-induced rotations and double-immunofluorescence experiments. Our results demonstrate that transplanted embryonic NPCs derived from the cortical ventricular zone of E14.5 transgenic mouse embryos expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of the beta-actin promoter and cultured as neurospheres can survive in the host striatum for at least three weeks after transplantation. The percentage of surviving GFP-positive cells in the host striatum ranges from 0.2% to 0.6% of the total transplanted NPCs. Grafted cells functionally integrate in the striatum, as indicated by the statistically significant decrease of contralateral rotations after apomorphine treatment. Furthermore, we show that within the striatal environment GFP-positive cells differentiate into beta-III tubulin-expressing neurons, but not glial cells. Most importantly, GFP-positive cells further differentiate to dopaminergic (TH-positive) and medium size spiny (DARPP-32- positive) neuronal phenotypes. Over-expression of the cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation protein Cend1 in NPCs enhances the generation of GABAergic, but not dopaminergic, neuronal phenotypes after grafting in the lesioned striatum. Our results encourage the development of strategies involving NPC transplantation for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder traditionally characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) at the midbrain. The potential use of adult or embryonic stem cells, induced pluriputent stem (iPS) cells and endogenous neurogenesis in cell replacement strategies has lead to numerous studies and clinical trials in this direction. It is now possible to differentiate stem cells into dopaminergic neurons in vitro and clinical trials have shown an improvement in PD-related symptoms after intra-striatal embryonic transplants and acceptable cell survival rates on the mid term. However, clinical improvement is transitory and associated with a strong placebo effect. Interestingly, recent pathological studies in PD patients who received embryonic stem cells show that in PD patients, grafted neurons show PD-related pathology. In this manuscript we review the latest findings regarding PD pathophysiology and give an outlook on the implications of these findings in how cell replacement strategies for PD treatment should be tested. These include changes in the type of animal models used, the preparation/conditioning of the cells before intracerebral injection, specially regarding backbone chronic diseases in iPS cells and determining the optimal proliferation, survival, differentiation and migration capacity of the grafted cells.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and its projections. Reports show a lower incidence of PD in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Nicotine reduce motor symptoms of patients already diagnosed with PD. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of nicotine in the dopamine (DA) depleted striatum remain elusive. This study evaluates the effects of chronic nicotine administration on PD motor symptoms in an attempt to mimic the chronic self-administration of nicotine in smokers. To achieve this, we used the 6-OHDA hemiparkinson rat model evaluating the amphetamine/apomorphine induced circling behavior, in rats whose daily water intake included nicotine. We found that chronic nicotine reduced amphetamine (AMPH) induced circling behavior by 40%, whereas apomorphine (APO) increased this behavior by 230%. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed that AMPH produced a 50% decrease of DA release in the intact hemisphere, while on the striatum of the lesioned side, receptor binding assays showed an increased affinity to D1 receptors and a concurrent decrease in D2 receptors. c-Fos activity showed through double labeling, that cell types involved in nicotine action were low threshold (LTS) and fast spiking (FS) inter-neurons, which increased in the DA-depleted striatum. We also observed an increase in the activity of D1 medium spiny neurons (D1 MSN), a striatal population with a major role in motor control. Our results show that chronic nicotine does not specifically protect against degeneration, but rather modifies DA receptor dynamics, suggesting that it could be used as a therapeutic element in PD pathology.",

Galantamine dose gradually increase to maximum of 16 mg/day (8 weeks) before rTMSand after that we start rTMS for 10 consecutive days. Cognitive, neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms were assessed clinically at baseline and at end of 10 weeks combined therapy using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Freezing Of Gait (FOG), Clinical Gait And Balance Scale (GABS), Tinetti scale, the clock drawing test, the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), PDQ-39 and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The metabolism in the frontal lobes, caudate nucleus, thalamus were assessed in 9 patients at baseline and end of rTMS by [18F]FDG-PET. Changes in total point scores on the scales at the ends of 10 weeks were compared with the baseline. Results were significant in the FOG (p = 0.00002), GABS (p = 0.000006), MMSE (p = 0.0001), FAB (0 = 0.003), PDQ-39 (p = 0.00009), BDI (p = 0.00004). Improvements in gait and decreases in freezing and falls were seen in the end of study period.

    "abstract": "This study was to determine the effect of exercise on the recovery of dopaminergic neuron loss and muscle atrophy in 6-OHDA-induced hemi Parkinson's disease model. Exercise was loaded twice per day for 30 minutes each time, at 5 days after 6-OHDA lesioning and continued for 16 days using a treadmill. Exercise significantly increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neuron in the lesioned substantia nigra and the expression level of tyrosine hydroxylase in the striatum compared with the control group. To examine which signaling pathways may be involved in the exercise, the phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 and ERK were observed in the striatum. In the control group, basal level of GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation was less than in both striatum, but exercise increased it. ERK phosphorylation decreased in the lesioned striatum, but exercise recovered it. These findings suggest that exercise inactivates GSK3\u03b2 by phosphorylation which may be involved in the neuroprotective effect of exercise on the 6-OHDA-induced cell death. In the exercise group, weight, and Type I and II fiber cross-sectional area of the contralateral soleus significantly recovered and expression of myosin heavy chain and Akt and ERK phosphorylation significantly increased by exercise. These results suggest that exercise recovers Parkinson's disease induced dopaminergic neuron loss and contralateral soleus muscle atrophy.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson\u2019s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that results primarily from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. However, other neurotransmitter systems (noradrenergic,cholinergic and serotoninergic) are also involved in the disease. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence for a role of histamine as a neuromodulator in the mammalian central nervous system. Histamine-releasing neurons are exclusively located in the tuberomammilary nucleus of the hypothalamus, project to all major areas of the brain and participate in functions such as the regulation of sleep/wakefulness, locomotor activity, autonomic and vestibular functions, feeding and drinking, analgesia, learning and memory. In this work we review the pathophysiological characteristics of Parkinson's disease and the emerging information about alterations in histaminergic transmission reported for parkinsonian patients and animal models of the disease. In particular, we focus on the role of histamine H3 receptors, expressed at high density in the basal ganglia, in the normal function of these nuclei and their possible participation in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "A 10-year-old girl presented to the emergency department of a regional hospital with 1 episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Postictal monitoring followed by a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed fast atrial fibrillation with intermittent wide QRS regular tachycardia. Immediately following this, her rhythm changed to wide QRS irregular tachycardia without hemodynamic compromise. She was suspected to have ventricular tachycardia and was treated with intravenous amiodarone with cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Subsequent electrocardiogram in sinus rhythm showed typical features of manifest Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) accessory pathway. This case illustrates the diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in patients with atrial fibrillation, wide QRS tachycardia, and undiagnosed WPW syndrome with antidromic conduction of atrial arrhythmias through the accessory pathway. Furthermore, this case demonstrates that undiagnosed wide QRS tachycardias need to be treated with drugs acting on the accessory pathway, thus keeping in mind underlying WPW syndrome as a possibility to avoid potentially catastrophic events.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) using a sole gene to express multiple transcripts with diverse protein coding sequences and/or RNA regulatory elements raises genomic complexities. In the nervous system, several thousand AS events play important roles in ion transportation, receptor recognition, neurotransmission, memory, and learning. Not surprisingly, AS influences human physiology, development, and disease. Many research studies have focused on aberrant AS in nervous system diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. PD affects the lives of several million people globally. It is caused by protein aggregation, such as in Lewy bodies, and the loss of dopaminecontaining neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. To our knowledge, six genes, including PARK2, SNCAIP, LRRK2, SNCA, SRRM2, and MAPT, are involved in aberrant AS events in PD patients. In this review, we highlight the relevance of aberrant AS in PD and discuss the use of an aberrant AS profile as a potential diagnostic or prognostic marker for PD and as a possible means of applying therapy.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease and typically presents with tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. The hallmark pathological features of PD are loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the presence of neuronal intracellular Lewy body (LB) inclusions. In general, PD is sporadic; however, familial PD, while uncommon, can be inherited in an autosomal dominant (AD) or autosomal recessive (AR) manner. The molecular investigations of proteins encoded by PD-linked genes have clarified that ADPD is associated with \u03b1-synuclein and LRRK2, while ARPD is linked to Parkin, PINK1, DJ1, and ATP13A2. Understanding these genes can bring insights into this disease and create possible genetic tests for early diagnosis. Long-term pharmacological treatment is so far disappointing, probably due to unwanted complications and decreasing drug efficacy. Several strategies have been proposed and tested as alternatives for PD. Cellular transplantation of dopamine-secreting stem cells opens the door to new therapeutic avenues for restoration of the functions of degenerative and/or damaged neurons in PD.",

    "abstract": "To compare the relative efficacy of visual versus auditory cueing on gait among individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nA systematic search was completed up to September 2011, using the following databases: EMBASE, Scopus, Medline, CINAHL, and PubMed.\nFour authors searched the databases using the following terms: Parkinson's disease (including abbreviations), gait, cadence, step, pace, cueing, cues, and prompt. All studies that evaluated the effect of cueing on gait in PD were selected by consensus of 2 pairs of authors who reviewed the titles and abstracts. Each pair of authors then applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to each study, and 25 articles were chosen. Inclusion criteria were cueing studies that reported pre- and postoutcome measures of gait parameters. Exclusion criteria were lack of data and studies that evaluated gait aids.\nGait measures of cadence, stride length, and velocity, before and after cueing, were collected from each study. If data were represented in graphs, a pair of authors extracted the data points individually, then compared and averaged values.\nThe data were synthesized using a meta-analysis based on cue type. Auditory cueing demonstrated significant improvement of cadence (Hedge g=.556; 95% confidence interval [CI], .291-.893), stride length (Hedge g=.497; 95% CI, .289-.696), and velocity (Hedge g=.544; 95% CI, .294-.795). In contrast, visual cueing significantly improved stride length only (Hedge g=.554; 95% CI, .072-1.036).\nThe findings suggest that auditory cueing is more effective for treating gait disorders in PD. Further research is needed to determine the optimum auditory cueing strategy for gait improvements.",

    "abstract": "Dyskinetic disorders are characterized by excess of motor activity that may interfere with normal movement control. In patients with Parkinson's disease, the chronic levodopa treatment induces dyskinetic movements known as levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID). This paper analyzed the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, pharmacological treatments, and surgical procedures to treat hyperkinetic disorders. Surgery is currently the only treatment available for Parkinson's disease that may improve both parkinsonian motor syndrome and LID. However, this paper shows the different mechanisms involved are not well understood.",

    "abstract": "It is generally accepted that a correlation between neurodegenerative disease and protein aggregation in the brain exists; however, a causal relationship has not been elucidated. In neurons, failure of autophagy may result in the accumulation of aggregate-prone proteins and subsequent neurodegeneration. Thus, pharmacological induction of autophagy to enhance the clearance of intracytoplasmic aggregate-prone proteins has been considered as a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate pathology in cell and animal models of neurodegenerative disorders. However, autophagy has also been found to be a factor in the onset of these diseases, which raises the question of whether autophagy induction is an effective therapeutic strategy, or, on the contrary, can result in cell death. In this paper, we will first describe the autophagic machinery, and we will consider the literature to discuss the neuroprotective effects of autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Two recent studies identified a mutation (p.Asp620Asn) in the vacuolar protein sorting 35 gene as a cause for an autosomal dominant form of Parkinson disease . Although additional missense variants were described, their pathogenic role yet remains inconclusive.\nWe performed the largest multi-center study to ascertain the frequency and pathogenicity of the reported vacuolar protein sorting 35 gene variants in more than 15,000 individuals worldwide. p.Asp620Asn was detected in 5 familial and 2 sporadic PD cases and not in healthy controls, p.Leu774Met in 6 cases and 1 control, p.Gly51Ser in 3 cases and 2 controls. Overall analyses did not reveal any significant increased risk for p.Leu774Met and p.Gly51Ser in our cohort.\nOur study apart from identifying the p.Asp620Asn variant in familial cases also identified it in idiopathic Parkinson disease cases, and thus provides genetic evidence for a role of p.Asp620Asn in Parkinson disease in different populations worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Recent genome-wide association studies indicate that a simple alteration of Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene expression may contribute to the etiology of sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the expression and regulation of LRRK2 protein in the sporadic PD brains remain to be determined. Here, we found that the expression of LRRK2 protein was enhanced in the sporadic PD patients using the frontal cortex tissue from a set of 16 PD patients and 7 control samples. In contrast, no significant difference was detected in the level of LRRK2 mRNA expression between the control and PD cases, suggesting a potential post-transcriptional modification of the LRRK2 protein expression in the sporadic PD brains. Indeed, it was identified that microRNA-205 (miR-205) suppressed the expression of LRRK2 protein through a conserved-binding site at the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of LRRK2 gene. Interestingly, miR-205 expression was significantly downregulated in the brains of patients with sporadic PD, showing the enhanced LRRK2 protein levels. Also, in vitro studies in the cell lines and primary neuron cultures further established the role of miR-205 in modulating the expression of LRRK2 protein. In addition, introduction of miR-205 prevented the neurite outgrowth defects in the neurons expressing a PD-related LRRK2 R1441G mutant. Together, these findings suggest that downregulation of miR-205 may contribute to the potential pathogenic elevation of LRRK2 protein in the brains of patients with sporadic PD, while overexpression of miR-205 may provide an applicable therapeutic strategy to suppress the abnormal upregulation of LRRK2 protein in PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the progression of cortical thinning and gray-matter (GM) volume loss in early Parkinson's disease (PD). MRI and neuropsychological assessment were obtained at baseline and follow-up (mean \u00b1 standard deviation = 35.50 \u00b1 1.88 months) in a group of 16 early-PD patients (H & Y stage \u2264II and disease duration \u22645 years) and 15 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and years of education. FreeSurfer software was used for the analysis of cortical thickness as well as for cortical and subcortical volumetric analyses. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was performed using SPM8. Compared to controls, PD patients showed greater regional cortical thinning in bilateral frontotemporal regions as well as greater over-time total GM loss and amygdalar volume reduction. PD patients and controls presented similar over-time changes in cognitive functioning. In early-PD patients, global GM loss, amygdalar atrophy, and cortical thinning in frontotemporal regions are specifically associated with the PD-degenerative process.",

    "abstract": "ATP13A2 is a lysosome-specific transmembrane ATPase protein of unknown function. This protein was initially linked to Kufor-Rakeb syndrome where it is absent or mutated. More recently, point mutations in ATP13A2 were linked to familial cases of Parkinson's disease. Zebrafish is commonly used as a vertebrate model for the study of different neurodegenerative diseases and has homologues of several Parkinson's disease associated proteins. Here, we describe for the first time the zebrafish homologue of human ATP13A2, demonstrating the homology between the protein sequences, which supports a conserved biological role. Furthermore, the spatial pattern of protein expression was studied and the lethality of the knockdown of ATP13A2 suggests it plays a crucial role during embryonic development. Our findings bring new insight into the biology of ATP13A2 and open novel opportunities for its study using zebrafish as a model organism.",

    "abstract": "Previously we demonstrated that systemically administered neuregulin-1-\u03b21, a nerve growth and differentiation factor, passed the blood-brain barrier and accumulated in brain areas with expression of its receptor ErbB4. In substantia nigra (SN), neuregulin-1-\u03b21 phosphorylated ErbB4 and protected dopaminergic neurons in a toxin-based mouse model of Parkinson disease (PD). We studied ErbB4 in the context of human midbrain dopaminergic degeneration in vivo and in vitro. Post-mortem ventral midbrain tissue sections of neuropsychiatric healthy individuals and PD patients (matched for age, gender and post-mortem delay) were immunostained for ErbB4. Cultured Lund human mesencephalic (LUHMES) post-mitotic dopaminergic neurons were treated with dopaminergic toxins and analyzed for ErbB4 expression. In control individuals, 85.0\u00b15.0% of dopaminergic neurons, containing cytoplasmic neuromelanin, expressed ErbB4 in the SN. In PD cases, the percentage of ErbB4-positive nigral dopaminergic neurons was increased to 94.9\u00b12.5%. The mean ErbB4 immunoreactivity of melanized neurons was higher in PD than controls. LUHMES neurons upregulated ErbB4 when exposed to toxins 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium and 6-hydroxydopamine. Increased rate of ErbB4-positive dopaminergic neurons in PD may either reflect a better survival of ErbB4-positive neurons or an increased expression of ErbB4 by remaining neurons to seek trophic support. Enhanced ErbB4 expression in human in vitro toxin-based PD models supports the latter interpretation. Thus, dopaminergic neurons in SN might be susceptible to neuregulin-1 treatment in PD.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common symptom in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) representing a major cause of disability and falls. Although the pathophysiology of FOG remains poorly understood, nondopaminergic pathways have been implicated. Treatment studies of levodopa and selegiline have shown limited benefit for FOG. Limited data suggest that amantadine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, may be beneficial for FOG in PD.\nTo examine the relationship between treatment with oral amantadine and FOG in patients with PD.\nWe conducted a retrospective chart review of PD patients who received amantadine specifically for FOG and had a follow-up assessment of FOG. The primary outcome measure was self-reported effectiveness of amantadine (improvement, worsening, or no change in FOG) based on records from the follow-up assessment.\nEleven patients with PD with median age of PD onset of 67 years (range, 51-84 years) and median Hoehn and Yahr stage 3 (range, 2-4) met the study population selection criteria. Ten of 11 patients reported improvement in FOG after initiation of amantadine, whereas FOG worsened in one patient. Median amantadine dosage was 100 mg twice daily, and treatment duration was 20 months (range, 6-66 months). Four patients reported reduction in benefit after 4 months. Three patients reported adverse effects, including blurred vision, visual hallucinations, and peripheral edema; the latter 2 effects resulted in discontinuation of amantadine.\nAmantadine is associated with self-reported improvement in FOG in PD, but this effect may be transient. Further studies, including a randomized placebo-controlled trial, are needed to better evaluate this association.",

    "abstract": "Senescence marker protein 30 (SMP30) was recently identified as gluconolactonase, which is involved in vitamin C (VC) biosynthesis. Therefore, the antioxidant property of SMP30 is thought to be mediated by its gluconolactonase function. However, pathologic effects of SMP30 deficiency independent of VC biosynthesis have not been studied in models of neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of SMP30 deficiency on Parkinson's disease (PD) in SMP30 knockout (KO) mice. Wild type and SMP30 KO mice supplemented with VC were treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Our results showed that MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor function impairment were more significant in the SMP30 KO mice. Reactive oxygen species generation and microglia activation were higher in MPTP-treated SMP30 KO mice. However, SMP30 deficiency mitigated MPTP-induced astrocyte activation and glia-derived neurotrophic factor production. Cultures of astrocytes recovered from wild type and SMP30 KO mice revealed that SMP30 deficiency abolished 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium-induced astroglial activation by blocking the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Taken together, our findings demonstrate for the first time that SMP30 deficiency increases the severity of PD and suggest a beneficial role of SMP30 in protective astrocyte activation in response to neurodegeneration. The present study shows that modulation of astrocytic SMP30 can be a promising target for treating PD.",

    "abstract": "Protein and amine halogenation is a type of oxidative stress induced by phagocytic overstimulation, and its role in Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been discerned. We have detected that advanced oxidized protein products, markers of protein halogenation, are reliably enhanced in serum of patients with PD (n=60) relative to control subjects (n=45, p<0.012), and to a lesser extent in the cerebrospinal fluid. Amine halogenation, as evaluated through 3-chlorotyrosine, is not affected. Mieloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide levels, halogenative factors of phagocytes, are devoid of changes. Levels of advanced oxidized protein products are progressively reduced over time, and the duration of PD is larger in the Hoehn-Yahr-stage-2/3 patients (n=34) with low serum levels (R(2)=0.0145, p<0.003). Levodopa treatment contributes to this reduction (R(2)=0.259, p<0.001). These protein products are not cytotoxic, unlike 3-chlorotyrosine, but they are known to form inflammatory mediators after conjugation with serum albumin. Our observations lead to the hypothesis that the serum level of advanced oxidized protein products is a prognostic marker of PD duration, and these oxidized proteins could participate in the development of parkinsonian neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have shown that Parkinson's disease (PD) affects not only the ability to generate voluntary saccades but also the ability to suppress reflexive saccades (hyper-reflexivity). To further investigate these apparently contradictory effects of PD on the saccade system we adapted a well-known dual-task paradigm (Deubel, 2008) to measure saccades with and without a peripheral discrimination task. Previously we reported that the concurrent performance of a perceptual discrimination task abnormally reduced the latencies of reflexive saccades in PD. Here we report the effects of the concurrent discrimination task on the generation of voluntary saccades in a PD and a control group. As expected, when saccades were performed without the discrimination task the PD group made voluntary saccades with longer latencies and smaller gain than the control group. The concurrent performance of the perceptual discrimination task facilitated the initiation of voluntary saccades in both groups, but, surprisingly, this facilitatory effect was stronger in the PD group than in the control group. In addition, in the PD group voluntary saccades were abnormally facilitated by the peripheral symbol-changes that occur during saccade planning in this paradigm. The results of this study may help to clarify apparently contradictory oculomotor abnormalities observed in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by a substantial cognitive heterogeneity, which is apparent in different profiles and levels of severity. To date, a distinct clinical profile for patients with a potential risk of developing dementia still has to be identified. We introduce a data-driven approach to detect different cognitive profiles and stages. Comprehensive neuropsychological data sets from a cohort of 121 Parkinson's disease patients with and without dementia were explored by a factor analysis to characterize different cognitive domains. Based on the factor scores that represent individual performance in each domain, hierarchical cluster analyses determined whether subgroups of Parkinson's disease patients show varying cognitive profiles. A six-factor solution accounting for 65.2% of total variance fitted best to our data and revealed high internal consistencies (Cronbach's alpha coefficients >0.6). The cluster analyses suggested two independent patient clusters with different cognitive profiles. They differed only in severity of cognitive impairment and self-reported limitation of activities of daily living function but not in motor performance, disease duration, or dopaminergic medication. Based on a data-driven approach, divers cognitive profiles were identified, which separated early and more advanced stages of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease without dementia. Importantly, these profiles were independent of motor progression.",

    "abstract": "We present the case of a 2-year-old asthmatic boy with atrioventricular (AV)-reentry tachycardia following albuterol inhalation, who was later diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale score for this adverse event was 7, indicating that the association between his AV-reentry tachycardia and inhalation of albuterol is probable. To our knowledge, this is the first case report that shows the potential arrhythmogenic effects of albuterol in a child with WPW syndrome. We urge clinicians to be aware of this potentially life-threatening adverse effect and to closely monitor these patients when they need beta-adrenergic drugs in case of emergency. Furthermore, this report highlights the dilemma regarding the safe treatment of pediatric patients with both asthma and WPW syndrome.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), the motor presentation characterised by postural instability/gait difficulties (PIGD) heralds accelerated motor, functional and cognitive decline, as compared with the more benign tremor-dominant (TD) variant. This makes the PIGD complex an attractive target for the discovery of prognostic biomarkers in PD.\nTo explore in vivo whether variability in brain amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) metabolism affects the initial motor presentation in PD.\nWe quantified cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations and ratios of A\u03b242, A\u03b240 and A\u03b238 using a triplex immunoassay in 99 patients with de novo PD with the PIGD phenotype (n=39) or the TD phenotype (n=60). All patients underwent standardised assessments of motor and neuropsychological function and cerebral MRI. 46 age-matched normal controls served as external reference.\nPatients with PD with the PIGD phenotype had significantly reduced CSF A\u03b242, A\u03b238, A\u03b242/40 and A\u03b238/40 levels compared with patients with the TD phenotype and controls. CSF marker levels in patients with PD-TD did not differ from those in controls. Multivariate regression models demonstrated significant associations of CSF A\u03b2 markers with severity of PIGD and lower limb bradykinesia in patients with PD, independently from age, MRI white matter hyperintensities and cognition. No associations were found between CSF markers and other motor features.\nMotor heterogeneity in de novo PD independently relates to CSF A\u03b2 markers, with low levels found in patients with the PIGD presentation. This suggests that disturbed A\u03b2 metabolism has an effect on PD beyond cognition and may contribute to the variable rate of motor and functional decline in PD.",

    "abstract": "In a previous functional MRI (fMRI) study, we found that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) presented with dysfunctions in the recruitment of recognition memory networks. We aimed to investigate the changes in these networks over time.\nWe studied 17 PD patients and 13 age and sex matched healthy subjects. In both groups fMRI (recognition memory paradigm) and neuropsychological assessments were obtained at baseline and at follow-up. To analyse changes over time in functional networks, model free (independent component analysis) analyses of the fMRI data were carried out. Then, a cross correlation approach was used to assess the changes in the strength of functional connectivity.\nAt follow-up, patients showed reduced recruitment of one network, including decreased activation in the orbitofrontal cortices, middle frontal gyri, frontal poles, anterior paracingulate cortex, superior parietal lobes and left middle temporal gyrus, as well as decreased deactivation in the anterior paracingulate gyrus and precuneus. Cross correlation analyses over time showed a decrease in the strength of functional connectivity between the middle frontal gyrus and the superior parietal lobe in PD patients.\nModel free fMRI and cross correlation connectivity analyses were able to detect progressive changes in functional networks involved in recognition memory in PD patients at early disease stages and without overt clinical deterioration. Functional connectivity analyses could be useful to monitor changes in brain networks underlying neuropsychological deficits in PD.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) contribute significantly to global disease burden. PD can be categorised into early-onset PD (EOPD) with an age at onset (AAO) of \u226450 years and late-onset PD (LOPD) with an AAO of 50 years.\nTo identify factors influencing EOPD and LOPD development in a group of patients in South Africa (SA).\nA total of 397 unrelated PD patients were recruited from the Movement Disorders Clinic at Tygerberg Hospital and via the Parkinson's Association of SA. Patient demographic and environmental data were recorded and associations with PD onset (EOPD v. LOPD) were analysed with a Pearson's Chi-squared test. The English- and Afrikaans-speaking (Afrikaner) white patients were analysed separately.\nLogistic regression analysis showed that ethnicity (p<0.001) and family history (p=0.004) were independently associated with AAO of PD. Average AAO was younger in black, coloured and Afrikaner patients than English-speaking white patients. A positive family history of PD, seen in 31.1% of LOPD patients, was associated with a younger AAO in the study population.\nThese associations may be attributed to specific genetic and/or environmental risk factors that increase PD susceptibility and influence the clinical course of the disorder. More studies on PD in the unique SA populations are required to provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying this debilitating condition.",

    "abstract": "In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) is well recognized in improving limb function, but the outcome on swallowing function has rarely been studied. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of STN DBS on pharyngeal swallowing function in patients with PD using self-estimation and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing.\nEleven patients (aged 41-72, median 61 years) were evaluated preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months after STN DBS surgery. All patients were evaluated with self-estimation on a visual analogue scale, and eight of them with a fiberoptic endoscopic examination with a predefined swallowing protocol including Rosenbek's Penetration-Aspiration Scale, Secretion Severity Scale, preswallow spillage, pharyngeal residue, and pharyngeal clearance.\nThe self-assessments of swallowing function revealed a subjective improvement with STN DBS stimulation, whereas the data from the swallowing protocol did not show any significant effect of the STN DBS treatment itself. The prevalence of aspiration was not affected by the surgery.\nThe results show that swallowing function was not negatively affected by STN DBS and the risk of aspiration did not increase. Self-estimation of swallowing function showed a subjective improvement due to stimulation.",

    "abstract": "The link between Parkinson's disease (PD) and certain primary sleep disorders has yet to be clarified. We performed a systematic review of case-control polysomnography studies to evaluate the relationship between PD and sleep disorders. A PubMed literature search and bibliography review yielded 15 case-control polysomnography studies in patients with PD. Studies differed by recruitment methods, duration of polysomnography monitoring, and sleep parameters measured. Subjective sleepiness was greater in patients than controls (50%-66% vs 2.9%-12%) despite lack of objective increase in daytime sleepiness by mean sleep latency testing. The 4 case-control polysomnography studies investigating rapid eye movement behavior disorder support a higher prevalence in PD (0%-47% vs 0%-1.8% in controls), although differences in diagnostic criteria hamper interpretation. The preponderance of evidence did not support an increased incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (27%-60% vs 13%-65%) or periodic leg movements of sleep in patients compared to controls. Adequately powered, prospective studies with uniform methodology and healthy controls are needed to further address the association and pathophysiological significance between PD and sleep problems.",

    "abstract": "A hyperechogenicity of the (SN+) in transcranial sonography corroborates the diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD). Although it is thought to represent a biomarker of the disease that is independent of disease severity and progression, differing results have been reported describing a positive correlation of the size and advancing clinical stage. In 50 parkinsonian patients, transcranial ultrasound and clinical examination was performed twice with a mean time interval of 6.4 years. SN+ did not change in size significantly between the first and second examination, whereas clinical parkinsonian symptoms--as determined by the motor part of the UPDRS--significantly worsened (P < 0.001). We found a highly significant intraindividual correlation in SN+ sizes between both examinations (P < 0.001). The size of SN+ did not correlate with the UPDRS part III at the time of first or second ultrasound examination. Progression of motor symptoms between the first and second investigation did not correlate with the size of SN+ at baseline. Furthermore, even in the subgroup of patients with an interval of \u2265 8 years between examinations, there was no significant change in SN+ size. SN+ represents a largely stable biomarker in iPD and does not reflect disease progression. The size of SN+ does not predict the further course of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Improved symptomatic and disease-modifying treatments are needed for Parkinson's disease (PD). Although significant advances have been made in the understanding of PD etiology, the translation of these discoveries into novel transformative therapies has been limited as a result of systemic challenges in PD drug development. Preclinical testing lacks clear standards and prioritization criteria for advancing therapies to the clinic. Clinical testing is marked by expensive, long, and uninformative studies. In parallel to these scientific challenges, funding of late-stage drug development has become increasingly scarce and risk averse. In this context, novel models of collaboration and funding are opening up new avenues for pursuing treatments. This review will discuss the most critical challenges in PD drug development and the innovative approaches being developed to overcome these hurdles.",

    "abstract": "Although dysphagia is a common problem for many Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, the effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on swallowing is unclear. Fourteen subjects with advanced PD underwent videofluorographic swallowing studies prior to bilateral DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and at 3 and 12 months postprocedure. They were tested under several stimulation and medication conditions. Subjects completed the Dysphagia Handicap Index at each time. There was a strong trend toward improved swallowing response for solid intake in the medication-free condition with the stimulator on compared with the stimulator off (P = .0107). Also, there was a trend toward improved oral preparation of thin liquids (P = .0368) in the medication-free condition when the stimulator was on versus off 12 months later. The remaining swallowing parameters showed no change or worsening of swallowing function regardless of stimulator or medication status. Results of the Dysphagia Handicap Index revealed significant improvement in subject self-perception of swallowing 3 and 12 months following the procedure compared with baseline on the functional subscale (P = .020 and P = .010, respectively), the emotional subscale (P = .013 and P = .003, respectively), and the total score (P = .025 and P = .003, respectively). These data suggest that bilateral STN-DBS does not substantively impair swallowing in PD. In addition, it may improve motor sequencing of the oropharyngeal swallow for solid consistencies (which are known to provide increased sensory feedback to assist motor planning of the oropharyngeal swallow). Subjects with advanced PD who are undergoing DBS may perceive significant improvement in swallowing ability despite the lack of objective improvements in swallowing function.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is part of a complex clinical picture in Parkinson's disease (PD) and is largely refractory to standard care. Diverging hypotheses exist about its origins, but a consolidated view on what determines FOG is lacking. The aim of this study was to develop an integrative model of FOG in people with PD. This cross-sectional study included 51 Parkinson subjects: 24 patients without FOG and 27 with FOG matched for age, gender, and disease severity. Subjects underwent an extensive clinical test battery evaluating general disease characteristics, gait and balance, nongait freezing, and cognitive functions. The relative contribution of these outcomes to FOG was determined using logistic regression analysis. The combination of the following four independent contributors provided the best explanatory model of FOG (R(2) = 0.49): nongait freezing; levodopa equivalent dose (LED); cognitive impairment; and falls and balance problems. The model yields a high-risk profile for FOG (P > 95%) when Parkinson patients are affected by at least one type of nongait freezing (e.g., freezing of other repetitive movements), falls or balance problems during the last 3 months, and a Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Cognition score below 28. A high LED further increases the risk of FOG to 99%. Nongait freezing, increased dopaminergic drug dose, cognitive deficits, and falls and balance problems are independent determinants of FOG in people with PD and may play a synergistic role in its manifestation.",

    "abstract": "The appearance of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) and ongoing degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons are two key features of Parkinson's disease (PD) that current treatments fail to address. Increased glutamate transmission contributes to the motor symptoms in PD, to the striatal plasticity that underpins LID and to the progression of neurodegeneration through excitotoxic mechanisms. Glutamate receptors have therefore long been considered as potential targets for pharmacological intervention in PD, with emphasis on either blocking activation of 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2-oxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or excitatory metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) 5 receptors or promoting the activation of group II/III mGlu receptors. Following a brief summary of the role of glutamate in PD and LID, this article explores the current status of pharmacological studies in pre-clinical rodent and primate models through to clinical trials, where applicable, that support the potential of glutamate-based therapeutic interventions. To date, AMPA antagonists have shown good efficacy against LID in rat and primate models, but the failure of perampanel to lessen LID in clinical trials casts doubt on the translational potential of this approach. In contrast, antagonists selective for NR2B-containing NMDA receptors were effective against LID in animal models and in small-scale clinical trials, though observed adverse cognitive effects need addressing. So far, mGlu5 antagonists or negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) look set to become the first introduced for tackling LID, with AFQ-056 reported to exhibit good efficacy in phase II clinical trials. NR2B antagonists and mGlu5 NAMs may subsequently prove to also be effective disease-modifying agents if their protective effects in rat and primate models of PD, respectively, are replicated in the next stages of investigation. Finally, group III mGlu4 agonists or positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), although in the early pre-clinical stages of investigation, are showing good efficacy against motor symptoms, neurodegeneration and LID. It is anticipated that the recent development of mGlu4 PAMs with improved systemic bioavailability will facilitate progression of these agents into the primate model of PD where their potential can be further explored.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms including depression are important features of Parkinson's disease (PD). We aim to address the relationship between major life events and depression amongst PD patients free of depressive symptoms at baseline.\nNew-onset PD patients from California were recruited in 2001-2007 and followed up for 3-4 years. The participants (n=221) were examined by neurologists and responded to comprehensive interviews that included major life events, social support, and coping measures from validated scales. Major depression was assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV depression module (SCID).\nMore than half of all patients had experienced major life events since diagnosed with PD, and 22 patients developed a major depression. The number of life events was associated with risk of depression in an exposure-dependent manner, with each additional event being associated with a 56% higher risk of depression (95% CI: 1.23-1.98). Most individual life events were associated with a two- to eight-fold higher risk of depression. Patients with low social support or coping capacities seemed to be particularly susceptible to developing depression after experiencing major life events.\nLife events play an important role for onset of depression in patients with PD; an effect that seems to be modulated by social support and coping capacities and these factors may therefore be important to assess in order to identify patients with PD at high risk of depression and provide effective interventions.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, however, intractable neurodegenerative disorder in the aging population. Levodopa (l-dopa) administration is regarded as the most effective strategy in treating PD with prominent motor side-effects after undergoing long-term treatment. Surgical therapies such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) show certain efficacy, yet there are several limitations in adopting such surgical procedures. Therefore, performing electrical stimulation out of the brain, namely peripheral stimulation for PD has been a dream of many clinicians. Recently, the efficacy of dorsal column stimulation was verified in animal PD models; on the other hand, tons of acupunctural studies from East Asia claim good efficacy in treating PD both in bench and clinical studies. This review will introduce the progress of peripheral stimulation for PD, and will discuss the potential mechanisms involved in these strategies.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests a crucial role for the unfolded protein response (UPR) in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we investigated the relevance of the UPR in a mouse model of chronic MPTP/probenecid (MPTP/P) injection, which causes severe and persistent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Enhanced activation of the UPR branches, including ATF6\u03b1 and PERK/eIF2\u03b1/ATF4, was observed after MPTP/P injections into mice. Deletion of the ATF6\u03b1 gene accelerated neuronal degeneration and ubiquitin accumulation relatively early in the MPTP/P injection course. Surprisingly, astroglial activation was strongly suppressed, and production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and anti-oxidative genes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and xCT, in astrocytes were reduced in ATF6\u03b1 -/- mice after MPTP/P injections. Decreased BDNF expression in ATF6\u03b1 -/- mice was associated with decreased expression of GRP78, an ATF6\u03b1-dependent molecular chaperone in the ER. Decreased HO-1 and xCT levels were associated with decreased expression of the ATF4-dependent pro-apoptotic gene CHOP. Consistent with these results, administration of the UPR-activating reagent tangeretin (5,6,7,8,4'-pentamethoxyflavone; IN19) into mice enhanced the expression of UPR-target genes in both dopaminergic neurons and astrocytes, and promoted neuronal survival after MPTP/P injections. These results suggest that the UPR is activated in a mouse model of chronic MPTP/P injection, and contributes to the survival of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, in part, through activated astrocytes.",

    "abstract": "Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitory potential of adenosine A(2A) receptor (AA(2A)R) antagonists has raised the possibility of designing dual-target-directed drugs that may provide enhanced symptomatic relief and that may also slow the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) by protecting against further neurodegeneration. To explain the dual inhibition of MAO-B and AA(2A)R at the molecular level, molecular docking technique was employed. Lamarckian genetic algorithm methodology was used for flexible ligand docking studies. A good correlation (R(2)= 0.524 and 0.627 for MAO-B and AA(2A)R, respectively) was established between docking predicted and experimental K(i) values, which confirms that the molecular docking approach is reliable to study the mechanism of dual interaction of caffeinyl analogs with MAO-B and AA(2A)R. Parameters for Lipinski's \"Rule-of-Five\" were also calculated to estimate the pharmacokinetic properties of dual-target-directed drugs where both MAO-B inhibition and AA(2A)R antagonism exhibited a positive correlation with calculated LogP having a correlation coefficient R(2) of 0.535 and 0.607, respectively. These results provide some beneficial clues in structural modification for designing new inhibitors as dual-target-directed drugs with desired pharmacokinetic properties for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in the nigrostriatal pathway of animals and humans and is responsible for most of the movement disorders, including rigidity. The present study aimed to determine the effect of chronic cigarette smoke, alcohol intake, and frequent sexual mating on 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tertahydro pyridine (MPTP)-induced rat model of PD. After treatment, the effect of these factors was determined by biochemical and molecular evaluation. Dopamine (DA) concentration, antioxidant enzymes, and mitochondrial activity decreased after treatment with cigarette smoke, alcohol, and frequent sexual mating when compared to the values in the control group. Excessive exposure of these factors may lead to neurodegeneration, dopaminergic toxicities, and, ultimately, clinical parkinsonism. Earlier literature from different publisher suggested that nicotine and cigarette smoke can protect the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra against MPTP toxicity. In this study, we assessed the effect of the above three factors on an MPTP-treated rat model and concluded that they have a neurodegenerative effect and were found to be toxic to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Further investigation is required to understand the exact etiology of clinical parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has evolved from an experimental procedure to a major treatment option for Parkinson's disease (PD). Although its underlying mechanism is still not fully understood, a growing body of evidence supports the role of DBS as an effective treatment option for carefully selected patients. Over time, the ever-expanding DBS patient cohort has also revealed the risks and challenges of the surgery. Major goals of this approach include identifying and reaching the correct target of stimulation, as well as delivering electrical current to the appropriate location in an appropriate manner. The safety concerns and adverse outcomes continue to be addressed with ever-improving operative strategies. Imminent developments in biomedical engineering hold the promise of more sophisticated and intelligent DBS devices, and improved imaging technology is providing unprecedented anatomical and functional resolution. Further advances in our understanding of physiology and pathology of the deep brain structures--guided not in small part by experience and access gained with DBS surgery in PD--will shape the future of this field.",

The BMS group included 27 women and 6 men (median age, 60.0 years), and the Parkinson disease group included 15 women and 5 men (median age, 66.5 years). In the control group, there were 20 women and 10 men (median age, 59.0 years). All patients were subjected to autonomic nervous system testing. In addition to the Low autonomic disorder questionnaire, heart rate variability (HRV), deep breathing (exhalation/inspiration [E/I] ratio), and sympathetic skin response (SSR) tests were performed in all cases. Parametric and nonparametric tests (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Scheffe tests) were used in the statistical analysis.\nThe mean values for HRV and E/I ratios were significantly lower in the burning mouth syndrome and Parkinson disease groups. Significant prolongation of SSR latency in the foot was revealed in both burning mouth syndrome and Parkinson disease patients, and lowering of the SSR amplitude occurred in only the Parkinson disease group. The autonomic questionnaire score was significantly higher in burning mouth syndrome and Parkinson disease patients than in the control subjects, with the Parkinson disease group having the highest scores.\nIn patients with burning mouth syndrome, a significant impairment of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems was found but sympathetic/parasympathetic balance was preserved. The incidence and intensity of autonomic nervous system dysfunction was similar in patients with burning mouth syndrome and Parkinson disease, which may suggest some similarity in their pathogeneses.",

    "abstract": "Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is found in 33-46% of patients with Parkinson's disease and was shown to be associated with cognitive deficits. Our goal was to improve our understanding of the role of this sleep disorder in cerebral dysfunction occurring in Parkinson's disease using a visual cognitive task and event-related potentials.\nSixteen patients with Parkinson's disease and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, 15 patients with Parkinson's disease without rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and 16 healthy control subjects were included. The amplitude and latency of event-related potentials were compared between groups.\nNo group differences were found for reaction times or accuracy. A Group effect was found for P2 wave amplitude; patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder had increased P2 in comparison with the control group (p < 0.05). Patients with Parkinson's disease alone were not different from the two other groups for this component. Prolonged novelty P3 latencies on Cz were associated with longer disease durations among patients with Parkinson's disease (p < 0.01).\nCo-morbid Parkinson's disease and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder were associated with abnormal visual P2 component of event-related potentials. Although patients with Parkinson's disease alone were not significantly different from patients with combined Parkinson's disease and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, their P2 amplitudes were not sufficiently abnormal to differ from that of control subjects. This study confirms that rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder accentuates cerebral dysfunctions in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most disabling symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), with a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Clinical studies using ad hoc questionnaires showed that in PD fatigue is associated with non-motor as well motor symptoms. Neurophysiological observations suggest that motor mechanisms play a role in the pathophysiology of fatigue but there is no clear correlation between fatigue measured with clinical instruments and fatigue assessed with neurophysiological tests. Neuroimaging studies show that fatigue is associated with an involvement of non-dopaminergic or extrastriatal dopaminergic pathways. It is conceivable that both motor and non-motor mechanisms underlie the pathophysiology of fatigue.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson 's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway, but this seems to constitute only part of the whole pathological process of the disease. Accumulating data have documented the concomitant degeneration of other dopaminergic pathways and of the serotonergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems. In addition, pathologic process is not only restricted in the brain, since the spinal cord and the peripheral autonomic nervous system are also affected. The pathogenesis of PD remains unclear. The use of positron emission tomography and single photon emission tomography may contribute to the understanding of these aspects of the disease. This review will discuss the role of PET and SPET in imaging the extrastriatal dopaminergic system and other neurotransmitter systems as well as the imaging of microglial activation and cardiac sympathetic denervation in PD. In conclusion, several PET and SPET ligands can detect changes in extrastriatal dopaminergic system as well as in the serotonergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic systems in PD and also explore its possible correlation with motor and non motor symptoms. The use of PET scintigraphy allows the detection of microglial activation in PD, while (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy depicts cardiac sympathetic denervation in PD and is a useful imaging tool for differentiating PD from other types of parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "Though previous studies have suggested that the basal ganglia are necessarily involved in action imitation, their precise role is unclear. An important source of evidence concerns patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who suffer basal ganglia impairments. Some studies report poor execution of observed meaningful (MF) transitive (tool-related) actions but normal performance with intransitive (non-tool-related) MF and meaningless (ML) actions (Leiguarda et al. in Brain 120:75-90, 1997; Leiguarda 2001 in Neuroimage 14:137-141). In other cases, though, patients with lesions involving the basal ganglia appear impaired in imitating ML as compared to meaningful MF transitive pantomimes. Here, we tested a group of PD patients in a full 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 design with MF transitive and intransitive pantomimes and matched ML movements. PD patients generated higher scores when imitating MF transitive actions than ML-matched actions. On the other hand, ML than MF intransitive actions did not differ significantly. The performance of the patients on imitating ML transitive actions also correlated with their performance on the Corsi block test of visuospatial memory and their scores at the test of verbal fluency for phonemic categories (FAS) while MF intransitive actions correlated with FAS and the neurological evaluation (UPDRS) The results are discussed in terms of the factors that load on visual memory for action reproduction, as well as the possible role of the basal ganglia in communicative actions (for MF intransitive actions).",

To elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the anti-parkinsonism effects of zonisamide, we examined the effect of zonisamide co-administered with levodopa in the striata of rats with 6-hydoroxydopamine hemiparkinsonism by using a DNA microarray for genome-wide gene expression profiling. We found that the expression of some genes related to metabolism and nervous system development and function were upregulated by zonisamide; expression of these genes was downregulated by levodopa. Furthermore, many genes related to the immune system and inflammation were downregulated by zonisamide, and their expression was upregulated by levodopa. These results indicate that zonisamide has a protective effect when co-administered with levodopa.",

This study evaluates the impact of testing protocol and pathology on the reliability of gait variability.\nTo (i) estimate the reliability of gait variability during continuous and intermittent walking protocols in older adults and people with Parkinson's disease (PD), (ii) determine optimal number of steps for acceptable levels of reliability of gait variability and (iii) provide sample size estimates for use in clinical trials.\nGait variability was measured twice, one week apart, in 27 older adults and 25 PD participants. Participants walked at their preferred pace during: (i) a continuous 2 min walk and (ii) 3 intermittent walks over a 12 m walkway. Gait variability was calculated as the within-person standard deviation for step velocity, length and width, and step, stance and swing duration.\nReliability of gait variability ranged from poor to excellent (intra class correlations .041-.860; relative limits of agreement 34-89%). Gait variability was more reliable during continuous walks. Control and PD participants demonstrated similar reliability. Increasing the number of steps improved reliability, with most improvement seen across the first 30 steps.\nIn this study, we identified testing protocols that improve the reliability of measuring gait variability. We recommend using a continuous walking protocol and to collect no fewer than 30 steps. Early PD does not appear to impact negatively on the reliability of gait variability.",

    "abstract": "Nonmotor symptoms (NMSs) commonly occur in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study sought to explore the domains of NMSs that are more closely related to PD using nonmotor symptoms scale (NMSS), through a quantitative comparison of NMSs' prevalence and NMSS scores of PD patients with normal controls, and clinical implications. We performed a prospective case-control study on PD patients (n=131) and age- and gender-matched normal controls (n=129). We compared NMSs' prevalence and NMSS scores of the PD patients with those of normal controls, and obtained the ratio to identify the domains that were more closely related to PD than normal aging using the NMSS. NMSs are very common among normal elderly as well as PD patients. The domains with the highest ratio of NMSs' prevalence and NMSS scores between the patient and control groups were the miscellaneous, perceptual problems/hallucinations, and sexual function. These three domains were found to be most closely related to PD. NMSs with higher prevalence in PD patients do not always relate more to PD. As NMSs in PD can also commonly occur among the normal elderly, the NMS prevalence should be interpreted with extreme caution. To properly manage the NMSs in PD, it should be kept in mind that avoiding the overestimation of NMSs as part of PD is as important as their early recognition in PD.",

    "abstract": "By permitting remote assessments of patients and research participants, telemedicine has the potential to reshape clinical care and clinical trials for Parkinson disease. While the majority of the motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) items can be conducted visually, rigidity and retropulsion pull testing require hands-on assessment by the rater and are less feasible to perform remotely in patients' homes.\nIn a secondary data analysis of the Comparison of the Agonist pramipexole vs. Levodopa on Motor complications in Parkinson's Disease (CALM-PD) study, a randomized clinical trial, we assessed the cross-sectional (baseline and 2 years) and longitudinal (change from baseline to 2 years) reliability of a modified motor UPDRS (removing rigidity and retropulsion items) compared to the standard motor UPDRS (all items) using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), stratified by treatment group. Internal consistency of the modified UPDRS (mUPDRS) was measured using Cronbach's alpha, and concurrent validity was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between the standard motor UPDRS and mUPDRS.\nThe mUPDRS versus standard motor UPDRS is cross-sectionally (ICC \u2265 0.92) and longitudinally (ICC \u2265 0.92) reliable for both treatment groups. High internal consistencies were also observed (\u03b1 \u2265 0.96). The mUPDRS had high concurrent validity with the standard UPDRS at both time points and longitudinally (r \u2265 0.93, p < 0.0001).\nA modified version of the motor UPDRS without rigidity and retropulsion pull testing is reliable and valid and may lay the foundation for its use in remote assessments of patients and research participants.",

    "abstract": "A series of compounds related to piperine and antiepilepsirine was screened in a monoamine oxidase A and B assay. Piperine is an alkaloid from the source plant of both black and white pepper grains, Piper nigrum. Piperine has been shown to have a wide range of activity, including MAO inhibitory activity. The z-factor for the screening assay was found to be greater than 0.8 for both assays. Notably, the compounds tested were selective towards MAO-B, with the most potent compound having an IC(50) of 498 nM. To estimate blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, we used a PAMPA assay, which suggested that the compounds are likely to penetrate the BBB. A fluorescent bovine serum albumin (BSA) high-throughput screening (HTS) binding assay showed an affinity of 8 \u03bcM for piperine, with more modest binding for other test compounds. Taken together, the data described here may be useful in gaining insight towards the design of selective MAO-B inhibitory compounds devoid of MAO-A activity.",

    "abstract": "Studies suggest that drivers with Parkinson's disease (PD) are more likely than controls to restrict their exposure and avoid challenging situations possibly to compensate for declining abilities; however it is questionable whether patient reports should be taken at face value. To address this issue, this study examined agreement between self-reported and actual driving practices in drivers with and without PD.\nTwo electronic devices (one with GPS) were installed in the vehicles of 26 drivers with PD (mean age 71.5 \u00b1 6.8, 77% men) and 20 controls (mean age 70.6 \u00b1 7.9, 80% men) for two weeks. Participants completed a questionnaire on usual driving patterns, scales on Situational Driving Frequency (SDF) and Avoidance (SDA), the MoCA and an interview.\nSelf-estimates of distance driven (km) over the two weeks were inaccurate in both groups; however the tendency to under-estimate was more pronounced in PD drivers. Drivers with PD reported more self-restrictions (higher SDA scores, p < .01; lower SDF scores, p < .05), yet drove more at night, in bad weather, in rush hour and on highways than they reported. Drivers with PD had significantly lower MoCA scores overall (p < .01) and on the memory subtest (p < .05), however, MoCA scores were not correlated with self-reported restrictions, or actual driving distance in either group.\nThese findings indicate that patient reports of driving behavior should not be taken at face value by researchers or clinicians. Patients with PD may be more likely than drivers in general to have problems with recall and possibly less awareness of their driving practices.",

    "abstract": "Using resting-state (RS) fMRI, we investigated the functional integrity of the default-mode network (DMN) in cognitively unimpaired patients with Parkinson disease (PD).\nRS fMRI at 3 T was collected in 16 cognitively unimpaired patients with PD and 16 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Single-subject and group-level independent component analysis was used to investigate differences in functional connectivity within the DMN in patients with PD and healthy controls. Statistical analysis was performed using BrainVoyager QX. In addition, we used voxel-based morphometry to test whether between-group differences in RS functional connectivity were related to structural abnormalities.\nPatients with PD compared with controls showed a decreased functional connectivity of the right medial temporal lobe and bilateral inferior parietal cortex within the DMN. Although patients with PD were cognitively unimpaired, the decreased DMN connectivity significantly correlated with cognitive parameters but not with disease duration, motor impairment, or levodopa therapy. The analysis of regional volume differences did not reveal any differences in local gray matter between patients and controls.\nOur findings revealed a functional disruption of the DMN in cognitively unimpaired patients with PD, in the absence of significant structural differences between patients and controls. We hypothesize that a dysfunction of the DMN connectivity may have a role in the development of cognitive decline in PD.",

    "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) is an environmental risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Recessive inheritance of PARK2 mutations is strongly associated with early onset PD (EOPD). It is widely assumed that the influence of PD environmental risk factors may be enhanced by the presence of PD genetic risk factors in the genetic background of individuals. However, such interactions may be difficult to predict owing to the complexities of genetic and environmental interactions. Here we examine the potential of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived early neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to model differences in Mn neurotoxicity between a control subject (CA) with no known PD genetic risk factors and a subject (SM) with biallelic loss-of-function mutations in PARK2 and family history of PD but no evidence of PD by neurological exam. Human iPS cells were generated from primary dermal fibroblasts of both subjects. We assessed several outcome measures associated with Mn toxicity and PD. No difference in sensitivity to Mn cytotoxicity or mitochondrial fragmentation was observed between SM and CA NPCs. However, we found that Mn exposure was associated with significantly higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in SM compared to CA NPCs despite significantly less intracellular Mn accumulation. Thus, this report offers the first example of human subject-specific differences in PD-relevant environmental health related phenotypes that are consistent with pathogenic interactions between known genetic and environmental risk factors for PD.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to evaluate and compare clinical management, utilisation of health services and quality of life (QoL) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) attending clinics in urban and regional Victoria. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 210 patients with PD attending specialist neurological clinics in a regional area (Ballarat) (n=97), and an urban area (Melbourne) (n=113), Victoria. Demographic characteristics of patients with PD, QoL, patterns of disease and management and utilisation of medical and allied health services were analysed. Compared to patients with PD from urban clinics, patients in the regional clinic were significantly older and were diagnosed at a later age with a shorter duration of treatment (all p<0.05). Despite no significant difference in disease severity (measured by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores) between the groups, patients in the urban clinic reported a lower QoL (p=0.003). Patients in the regional clinic were more satisfied with their treatment, despite seeing their medical specialist less frequently (p<0.001) and having a higher rate of early misdiagnosis (p=0.015). Patients from regional clinics reported a poorer understanding of their illness than patients in the urban clinic (p=0.049). Half of all respondents were interested in using telemedicine services. Two-thirds (71%) of all patients used allied health services, with patients in the urban clinic utilising more and desiring greater access to these services (p<0.05). In conclusion, we found significant differences in the presentation, management and use of health services between patients accessing regional and urban PD clinics in Victoria. Telemedicine may be an effective, and even desirable, method for facilitating improved diagnosis and referral for appropriate therapies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders of the elderly population. Few therapeutic options are available for patients with PD requiring palliative care. Treatment of the early stages of PD is entirely different from later stages. During the later stages, the palliative care model is introduced to provide the patient with comfort and support. Early palliative care in PD requires minimization of dyskinesias and decreasing occurrence of motor and non-motor off times in an effort to maximize independent motor function. In the later stages, the focus of treatment shifts to treating the predominant non-motor symptoms and having a more supportive and palliative nature. The purpose of this review is to provide a summary of the palliative care management issues and palliative care management options of end-stage PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has no known cause. Although recent research has focused particularly on genetic causes of PD, environmental causes also play a role in developing the disease. This article reviews environmental factors that may increase the risk of PD, as well as the evidence behind those factors. Enough evidence exists to suggest that age has a causal relationship to PD. Significant evidence exists that gender, tobacco use, and caffeine consumption are also associated with the development of PD. Other environmental factors (pesticide exposure, occupation, blood urate levels, NSAID use, brain injury, and exercise) have limited or conflicting evidence of a relationship to PD. Future research must not neglect the impact of these environmental factors on the development of PD, especially with respect to potential gene-environment interactions.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the neural substrates involved in visual working memory (WM) and the resulting effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation in Parkinson's disease (PD). Cerebral activation revealed by positron emission tomography was compared among Parkinson patients with (PD-ON) or without (PD-OFF) STN stimulation, and a group of control subjects (CT) in two visual WM tasks with spatial (SP) and nonspatial (NSP) components. PD-OFF patients displayed significant reaction time (RT) deficits for both memory tasks. Although there were no significant differences in RT between patients with PD-ON and -OFF stimulation, patients with PD-ON stimulation performed comparably to controls. The memory tasks were executed with normal error rates in PD-ON and -OFF stimulation. In contrast to these behavioral results, whether the corresponding prefrontal activation was differentially affected by deep brain stimulation status in patients depended on whether the WM modality was SP versus NSP. Thus, SP WM was associated with (1) abnormal reduction in dorsolateral prefrontal activity in PD-OFF and -ON stimulation and (2) abnormal overactivation in parieto-temporal cortex in PD-OFF and in limbic circuits in PD-ON stimulation. In NSP WM, normal activation of the ventral prefrontal cortex was restored in PD-ON stimulation. In both visual modalities the posterior cerebral regions including fusiform cortex and cerebellum, displayed abnormally reduced activity in PD. These results indicate that PD induces a prefrontal hypoactivation that STN stimulation can partially restore in a modality selective manner by additional recruitment of limbic structures in SP WM or by recovery of the ventral prefrontal activation in NSP WM.",

    "abstract": "Higher plasma urate level is reported to be associated with a reduced risk and slower progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we explored the effects of urate on dopaminergic neurons in nigrostriatal pathway in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) unilaterally lesioned rats. Uric acid (UA), when given twice daily at 200 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 10 consecutive days, elevated urate (the anionic form of UA) in plasma and striatum by 55% and 36.8%, respectively, as compared with vehicle group. This regimen of UA was found to ameliorate the behavioral deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss as well as dopamine depletion in the nigrostriatal system. Moreover, UA administration was capable of increasing glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity while decreasing malondialdehyde accumulation in striatum. In addition, the phosphorylation of both protein kinase B (Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3\u03b2) in the lesioned striata of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats was dramatically reduced as compared with sham-operated rats. This reduction was attenuated in the Parkinsonian rats receiving UA treatment. Similarly, in vitro findings showed that UA alleviated the decrease in Akt activation and the increase in GSK3\u03b2 activity caused by 6-OHDA. Furthermore, neuroprotection by urate and its regulation on GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation at Ser9 was found to be abolished in the presence of PI3K inhibitor. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that urate was able to protect dopaminergic neurons in rat nigrostriatal pathway against the neurotoxicity of 6-OHDA, and showed that its beneficial effects may be related to its regulation on Akt/GSK3\u03b2 signaling.",

    "abstract": "L-type calcium channels expressed in the brain are heterogeneous. The predominant class of L-type calcium channels has a Ca(V)1.2 pore-forming subunit. L-type calcium channels with a Ca(V)1.3 pore-forming subunit are much less abundant, but have been implicated in the generation of mitochondrial oxidant stress underlying pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease. Thus, selectively antagonizing Ca(V)1.3 L-type calcium channels could provide a means of diminishing cell loss in Parkinson's disease without producing side effects accompanying general antagonism of L-type calcium channels. However, there are no known selective antagonists of Ca(V)1.3 L-type calcium channel. Here we report high-throughput screening of commercial and 'in-house' chemical libraries and modification of promising hits. Pyrimidine-2,4,6-triones were identified as a potential scaffold; structure-activity relationship-based modification of this scaffold led to 1-(3-chlorophenethyl)-3-cyclopentylpyrimidine-2,4,6-(1H,3H,5H)-trione (8), a potent and highly selective Ca(V)1.3 L-type calcium channel antagonist. The biological relevance was confirmed by whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. These studies describe the first highly selective Ca(V)1.3 L-type calcium channel antagonist and point to a novel therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients vary widely in their response to levodopa treatment, and this may be partially genetic in origin. Recent studies suggest that catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), G1947A and monoamine oxidase B (MAOB), A644G polymorphisms might influence the risk and treatment of PD. Herein, we aimed to test the possible influence of MAOB and COMT genetic polymorphisms on the effective daily dose of levodopa administered in the fifth year of treatment. We also examined the effect of COMT and MAOB haplotypes on levodopa therapy outcome. There were 31 females and 72 males of Iranian origin diagnosed with sporadic PD included into the study. The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1: patients received daily doses of levodopa below 500 mg in the fifth year of treatment. Group 2: those patients receiving daily doses exceeding 500 mg in the fifth year of treatment. MAOB and COMT polymorphism genotyping was performed by using PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. Our data show that the first group suffered less frequently from dyskinesia than patients from the second group. No statistically significant differences were found in allele frequencies and genotype distributions of the studied genes between two groups. In addition, the incidence of the specific haplotypes between the two groups did not show any difference. The present data suggest that pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic factors other than the investigated genetic variants of the MAOB and COMT enzymes seem to determine the response to levodopa in the Iranian PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive motor debilitation, which affects several million people worldwide. Recent evidence suggests that glial cell activation and its inflammatory response may contribute to the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD. Currently, there are no neuroprotective agents available that can effectively slow the disease progression. Herein, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant efficacy of diapocynin, an oxidative metabolite of the naturally occurring agent apocynin, in a pre-clinical 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD.\nBoth pre-treatment and post-treatment of diapocynin were tested in the MPTP mouse model of PD. Diapocynin was administered via oral gavage to MPTP-treated mice. Following the treatment, behavioral, neurochemical and immunohistological studies were performed. Neuroinflammatory markers, such as ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), gp91phox and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), were measured in the nigrostriatal system. Nigral tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons as well as oxidative markers 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and striatal dopamine levels were quantified for assessment of the neuroprotective efficacy of diapocynin.\nOral administration of diapocynin significantly attenuated MPTP-induced microglial and astroglial cell activation in the substantia nigra (SN). MPTP-induced expression of gp91phox and iNOS activation in the glial cells of SN was also completely blocked by diapocynin. Notably, diapocynin markedly inhibited MPTP-induced oxidative markers including 3-NT and 4-HNE levels in the SN. Treatment with diapocynin also significantly improved locomotor activity, restored dopamine and its metabolites, and protected dopaminergic neurons and their nerve terminals in this pre-clinical model of PD. Importantly, diapocynin administered 3 days after initiation of the disease restored the neurochemical deficits. Diapocynin also halted the disease progression in a chronic mouse model of PD.\nCollectively, these results demonstrate that diapocynin exhibits profound neuroprotective effects in a pre-clinical animal model of PD by attenuating oxidative damage and neuroinflammatory responses. These findings may have important translational implications for treating PD patients.",

MPTP-induced expression of gp91phox and iNOS activation in the glial cells of SN was also completely blocked by diapocynin. Notably, diapocynin markedly inhibited MPTP-induced oxidative markers including 3-NT and 4-HNE levels in the SN. Treatment with diapocynin also significantly improved locomotor activity, restored dopamine and its metabolites, and protected dopaminergic neurons and their nerve terminals in this pre-clinical model of PD. Importantly, diapocynin administered 3 days after initiation of the disease restored the neurochemical deficits. Diapocynin also halted the disease progression in a chronic mouse model of PD.",

All of the PD patients were questioned regarding the presence of anorectal symptoms.\nAnorectal manometry was abnormal in 12 of the 19 patients. These abnormalities were more common in patients with more severe anorectal symptoms, as measured using a self-reported scale.

    "abstract": "Nonmotor symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is negatively affected by different factors, of which pain and sleep disturbances are important contributors. This study was performed to evaluate and describe subjective experiences of pain, sleeping patterns, and HRQoL in a cohort of PD patients with chronic pain.\nA total of 45 participants with established PD for more than 2 years, and PD-related pain for the preceding three months, were recruited from three sites in Sweden. Data regarding time point for onset, duration and degree of pain parameters, body localization of pain, external influences, and treatments were obtained. HRQoL was evaluated with the Short Form-36(\u00ae) Health Survey, and sleeping patterns were registered with the Parkinson's disease Sleep Scale, both completed along with a questionnaire.\nIn one-third of participants, pain preceded the PD diagnosis. Median pain score measured with a visual analog scale was 6.6 and 5.9 (for females and males, respectively) the week before the study. In almost half of the participants, pain was present during all their waking hours. Significantly more females described their pain as troublesome, while more males described their pain as irritating. Feelings of numbness and creeping sensations at night were strongly associated with the maximal visual analog scale scores. Polypharmacy was common; 89% used medication for anxiety/insomnia, and 18% used antidepressants. Only one-third of patients who reported pain relief with analgesics had these prescribed on their drug lists. Sleep was characterized by frequent awakenings. Urinary urgency and restless legs were frequently reported as troublesome. Patients rated HRQoL as significantly worse in all items compared with a healthy reference population matched for age and sex.\nExperiences of chronic PD-related pain are complex; there is substantial sleep fragmentation and negative impact on HRQoL.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by severe loss of substantia nigra dopamine (DA) neurons. The target region of substantia nigra DA neurons is the dorsal striatum. According to the classic model, activation of DA receptors on striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) modulates their intrinsic excitability. Activation of D1 receptors makes MSNs in the direct \"Go\" pathway more excitable, whereas activation of D2 receptors makes MSNs in the indirect \"NoGo\" pathway less excitable. Therefore increased DA increases the responsiveness of the Go pathway while decreases the responsiveness of the NoGo pathway. Both mechanisms increase motor output. Conversely, diminished DA will favor the inhibitory NoGo pathway. Therefore, DA has direct, \"on-line\" effect on motor performance. However, in addition to modulating the intrinsic excitability of MSNs \"on-line\", DA also modulates corticostriatal plasticity, therefore could potentially produce cumulative and long-lasting changes in corticostriatal throughput. Studies in my lab suggest that DA blockade leads to both direct motor performance impairment and D2 receptor dependent NoGo learning (\"learned\" motor inhibition) that gradually deteriorates motor performance. NoGo learning is experience dependent and task specific. It is different from blocked learning since NoGo learning impairs future performance even after DA is restored. More recent data from my lab suggest that NoGo learning in the absence of DA arises from increased LTP at the indirect pathway corticostriatal synapses and contributes significantly to PD-like motor symptoms. Our data and hypotheses suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for PD that targets directly signaling molecules for corticostriatal plasticity (e.g. the cAMP pathway and downstream signaling molecules) and prevents aberrant plasticity under conditions of DA denervation.",

    "abstract": "For the past 40 years Parkinson's disease (PD) has been intrinsically associated with dopamine (DA) deficiency of the nigrostriatal DA system. One of the fundamental strengths of this theoretical approach is based on a presumed relationship between the degree of DA deficiency and the severity of motor impairment in the disease and its models. However, detailed examination of a substantial number of exemplary preclinical and clinical studies reveals that any such interpretation is overoptimistic and suggests that DA deficiency may be merely an epiphenomenon of a larger process underlying this disorder. Such a conclusion is based on numerous examples of miscarriage of basic principles of good scientific practice including (i) failure to thoroughly examine the adverse effects of DA replacement, (ii) drawing of statistical inference without recognising excessive spread of measure thereby lessening the importance of outliers, (iii) confounding independent and dependent variables within the scientific paradigm, (iv) overlooking fundamental principles of modern pharmacology, (v) confusing correlation with causation in linking cause and effect and (vi) disinclination to incorporate conflicting findings thereby infringing the quintessential scientific principle of tertium quid. This review demonstrates the inherent risks and dangers in the incontrovertible defence of DA deficiency theory and serves to address the ethical problems that emerge from the clinical application of scientific findings. There is increasing interest in new directions for PD research by dimming down the current emphasis on the importance of DA deficiency and its replacement. This would provide genuine hope and a new direction for the sufferers of a most debilitating disease.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the evidence for pre-death grief in caregivers (CGs) of persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to compare non-motor PD symptoms (cognitive decline, depression, hallucinations) versus motor symptoms (fluctuations of mobility) for associations with CG grief reactions.\nProlonged grief in response to loss has been associated with negative outcomes and decreased well-being in caregivers (i.e. spouse or adult child) of relatives with dementia. In Parkinson's disease (PD) the negative impact of providing care has been referred to as caregiver strain. Grief has not been explored in PD caregivers, and understanding grief may offer new insights for future intervention.\nVolunteer caregivers (n = 74) filled out the Marwit and Meuser Caregiver Grief Inventory (MM-CGI-SF) which measures 3 types (i.e. subscales) of grief: Personal Sacrifice and Burden, Heartfelt Sadness and Longing, Worry and Felt Isolation. This scale also provided a total grief score. Volunteer caregivers also responded to self-reported UPDRS questions about the motor and non-motor symptoms of their PD relative (i.e. spouse or parent). T-tests were used to correlate CG subscales of grief with patient variables. A hierarchical regression analysis was used to determine the predictive contribution of motor and nonmotor symptoms to grief.\nGrief based on the total score was found in 17% of CGs. Grief was significantly higher in CG's whose relative had more severe symptoms. The type of grief experienced was similar across all three subscales. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that nonmotor symptoms explained slightly more of the variance (14-23%) than motor symptoms (11-17%).\nThis study revealed that pre-death grief is a significant finding in PD caregivers. The severity of symptoms and the presence of nonmotor symptoms, especially cognitive decline, predict caregivers who are at greatest risk of prolonged grief; however it should be kept in mind that motor symptoms also contribute.",

    "abstract": "Axonal degeneration is one of the earliest features of Parkinson's disease pathology, which is followed by neuronal death in the substantia nigra and other parts of the brain. Inhibition of axonal degeneration combined with cellular neuroprotection therefore seem key to targeting an early stage in Parkinson's disease progression. Based on our previous studies in traumatic and neurodegenerative disease models, we have identified rho kinase as a molecular target that can be manipulated to disinhibit axonal regeneration and improve survival of lesioned central nervous system neurons. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective potential of pharmacological rho kinase inhibition mediated by fasudil in the in vitro 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium cell culture model and in the subchronic in vivo 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Application of fasudil resulted in a significant attenuation of dopaminergic cell loss in both paradigms. Furthermore, dopaminergic terminals were preserved as demonstrated by analysis of neurite network in vitro, striatal fibre density and by neurochemical analysis of the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in the striatum. Behavioural tests demonstrated a clear improvement in motor performance after fasudil treatment. The Akt survival pathway was identified as an important molecular mediator for neuroprotective effects of rho kinase inhibition in our paradigm. We conclude that inhibition of rho kinase using the clinically approved small molecule inhibitor fasudil may be a promising new therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The most distinguishing feature of neurons is their capacity for regenerative electrical activity. This activity imposes a significant mitochondrial burden, especially in neurons that are autonomously active, have broad action potentials, and exhibit prominent Ca(2+) entry. Many of the genetic mutations and toxins associated with Parkinson's disease compromise mitochondrial function, providing a mechanistic explanation for the pattern of neuronal pathology in this disease. Because much of the neuronal mitochondrial burden can be traced to L-type voltage-dependent channels (channels for which there are brain-penetrant antagonists approved for human use), a neuroprotective strategy to reduce this burden is available.",

    "abstract": "Iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy provides useful diagnostic information in differentiating Parkinson's disease (PD) from other neurological diseases. Moreover, a number of studies have reported that 123I-MIBG imaging provides powerful diagnostic and prognostic information in congestive heart failure (HF) patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cardiovascular predictive value of cardiac 123I-MIBG imaging in patients with PD.\nSeventy-eight patients with PD were retrospectively studied. All patients underwent 123I-MIBG imaging at 30 min (early) and 240 min (delayed) after the tracer injection, and clinical parameters were also investigated.\nDuring a mean follow-up of 27 \u00b1 12 months, 5 patients required hospitalization for HF. There were no occurrences of myocardial infarction, fatal arrhythmia or sudden death. There was no significant coronary artery stenosis, significant valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy in the HF patients. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was normal in the HF patients. (123)I-MIBG delayed heart to mediastinal ratio (delayed H/M) was lower and washout rate (WR) was higher in HF patients than non-HF patients (1.62 \u00b1 0.21 vs. 1.34 \u00b1 0.08, p = 0.019; 31.9 \u00b1 5.5 vs. 38.2 \u00b1 3.3, p = 0.005, respectively). Both WR and delayed H/M did not correlate with Hoehn and Yahr stage. The WR showed a weak negative correlation with delayed H/M (R = -0.357, p < 0.001) upon simple linear regression analysis. A multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that WR and delayed H/M were independently associated with HF (p = 0.014, p = 0.029, respectively). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with abnormal WR (> 37%) and delayed H/M (< 1.48) had a higher incidence of HF than those with normal WR and delayed H/M (p = 0.014, p = 0.04, respectively).\nWR showed stronger predictive power than delayed H/M in Kaplan-Meier analysis. WR has more useful cardiovascular predictive value than delayed H/M in Japanese patients with PD. Further studies are needed to clarify the significance of abnormal MIBG uptake in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Acorus gramineus Solander (Acoraceae, AG), is a widely distributed plant in Asian countries. Rhizome part of this plant has long been used as a traditional medicine for treating various symptoms including central nervous system (CNS) disorders.\nThe anti-neuroinflammatory effect of AG aqueous extract was investigated using in vitro cellular and in vivo Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model.\nLipopolysaccharide (LPS) is used to stimulate BV-2 microglial cells in vitro and the changes in neuroinflammatory expressional levels were measured using ELISA, Western blotting, RT-PCR and immunofluorescence techniques. In in vivo experiments, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated mouse model of PD was developed followed by immunohistochemical analysis of specific brain tissues.\nLPS-stimulation to BV-2 cells increased the production of nitric oxide (NO) and proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1\u03b2. Pretreatment with AG extract inhibited the increased levels of NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells. Mechanistic study revealed that AG acts via the regulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and TRIF-dependent signaling pathways. Further, AG protected MPTP-induced neuronal cell death and inhibited neuroinflammation in vivo.\nOur results indicated that AG extract exerted anti-neuroinflammatory effects against activated microglia mediated insults through multiple signaling pathways and prevented in vivo neuronal cell death in mouse model of PD substantiating the traditional claims for its use in CNS disorders.",

    "abstract": "Little is known whether and how chronic exposure to dopaminergic treatment alters physiological mechanisms in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nTwo clinically similar groups of PD patients, one consisting of drug-na\u00efve patients and another of patients already on chronic dopaminergic medication (when off medication), were compared to each other and to a control group. Plasticity and excitability of the hand primary motor cortex of the more affected side were evaluated using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques.\nThere was little difference between two patient groups, and both groups showed similar differences in comparison to controls: decreased facilitatory sensory-motor plasticity (as measured by paired associative stimulation [PAS] protocol), impaired short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and diminished slope of input-output curves at higher TMS intensities. The exception was that 30 min after PAS, intracortical facilitation (ICF) was significantly reduced in drug-na\u00efve patients, whereas it changed much less in other two groups.\nChronic exposure to dopaminergic drugs does not affect substantially the features of motor cortex excitability and plasticity in PD. There is little interaction between plasticity and excitability features of motor cortex in PD.\nReduced response to facilitatory PAS protocol, reduced SICI, and reduced slope of the input-output curve at higher TMS pulse intensities, seem to be physiological markers for the presence of the pathological disease process in PD. Long term treatment does not seem to change the underlying physiology of the disease.",
