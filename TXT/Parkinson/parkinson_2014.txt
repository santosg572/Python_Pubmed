    "abstract": "In this article an attempt has been made to postulate a possible link between Parkinson's disease and periodontal disease.\nVarious systemic diseases such as cardiac disease, diabetes, renal diseases, low birth weight and Alzheimer's disease have been proposed to be linked with periodontal disease on the basis of systemic inflammation. Parkinson's disease is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder with multifactorial aetiology. Until now, periodontal disease and Parkinson's disease has been linked only on the basis of poor motor and cognitive control in Parkinson's patient which leads to poor oral health maintenance. Evidence now suggests that chronic neuroinflammation is consistently associated with the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. Also, recently, systemic inflammation has been suggested as one of the contributing factors for neurodegeneration.\nDental and medical literature especially those dealing with neurosciences were selected which highlighted the link between systemic inflammation and infection.\nSo far there is no direct evidence implicating an effect of periodontitis in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. To clarify this link, studies on population based case-control or cohort design are needed. This would be especially significant in the present era where there is paucity for preventive measures as far as a cognitive disorder such as Parkinson's disease is concerned.\nWe cannot cure Parkinson's disease, but if in future this missing link is established, an attempt can be made to prevent it by tackling one of its possible contributors (periodontitis) for systemic inflammation by simple preventive oral hygiene measures.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that emotional facial expressions alter temporal judgments. Moreover, while some studies conducted with Parkinson's disease (PD) patients suggest dysfunction in the recognition of emotional facial expression, others have shown a dysfunction in time perception. In the present study, we investigate the magnitude of temporal distortions caused by the presentation of emotional facial expressions (anger, shame, and neutral) in PD patients and controls. Twenty-five older adults with PD and 17 healthy older adults took part in the present study. PD patients were divided into two sub-groups, with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI), based on their neuropsychological performance. Participants were tested with a time bisection task with standard intervals lasting 400 ms and 1600 ms. The effect of facial emotional stimuli on time perception was evident in all participants, yet the effect was greater for PD-MCI patients. Furthermore, PD-MCI patients were more likely to underestimate long and overestimate short temporal intervals than PD-non-MCI patients and controls. Temporal impairment in PD-MCI patients seem to be mainly caused by a memory dysfunction. (JINS, 2016, 22, 890-899).",

    "abstract": "This review highlights the most important discovery in the reticular activating system (RAS) in the last 10 years, the manifestation of gamma (\u03b3) band activity in cells of the RAS, especially in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), which is in charge of the high frequency states of waking and rapid eye movement sleep. This discovery is critical to understanding the modulation of movement by the RAS and how it sets the background over which we generate voluntary and triggered movements. The presence of \u03b3 band activity in the RAS is proposed to participate in the process of preconscious awareness, and provide the essential stream of information for the formulation of many of our actions. Early findings using stimulation of this region to induce arousal, and also to elicit stepping, are placed in this context. This finding also helps explain the novel use of PPN deep brain stimulation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, although considerable work remains to be done.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that infects all nucleate cells of vertebrates. Human infected by vertical transmission and also using raw or undercooked meat or food and water that contaminated with mature oocysts. Parkinson's disease as neurodegenerative disease affects people above 60\u00a0years. Due to high prevalence of toxoplasmosis in Iran and evidence about effects of T. gondii on neurodegenerative diseases, this study has been conducted to investigate possible correlation between Toxoplasma and Parkinson's disease in Iran. Seventy five Parkinson's patients and equal healthy volunteers were enrolled. After obtaining informed consent and sociodemographic features, 5\u00a0ml blood sample were collected and then anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM levels were examined by ELISA method. Data was analyzed with Chi-squre and Fisher's test by usig stata 11 software. Binary logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis in assessing the correlation between toxoplasmosis and Parkinson. Eighty five percent of Parkinson's group and 90.3\u00a0% of control group were positive for anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibody. In this investigation no statically differences were observed between groups and age, gender, residency and using raw or undercooked meat. There is no significant association between IgG positive titer and Parkinson's disease. However, statistically significant association was found between Parkinson and keeping cat (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) as well as the using of undercooked egg (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Although there is high level of anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibody in Parkinson's patients which reflects chronic Toxoplasma infection; we couldn't detect any statistical association between T. gondii infection and Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects fitness to drive. Research that has examined clinical predictors of fitness to drive in PD, using the on-road assessment as the gold standard, has generally used a dichotomous pass/fail decision. However, on-road assessments may also result in one of two additional outcomes (pass with recommendations, or fail-remediable). Individuals within these subgroups may benefit from interventions to improve their fitness to drive abilities. This study investigated clinical predictors that could be indicative of the pass, pass with recommendations, or fail-remediable categories for drivers with PD (N = 99). Trails B, Left Finger to Nose Test, and contrast sensitivity measures were identified as significant predictors for the pass, and pass with recommendations subgroups. No significant predictors were identified for the fail-remediable subgroup. Results from this study provide a foundation for clinicians to identify drivers who can benefit from recommendations to preserve their driving abilities.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, increasing in incidence, with a known impact on fitness to drive. Although great progress has been made on evidence-based guidelines for assessing fitness to drive of persons with PD, a need remains for early identification of at-risk drivers in need of comprehensive assessment. This study investigated whether caregivers of drivers with PD could predict the driver's on-road outcome. We also investigated whether the predictive value of their impressions differed from that of drivers themselves, their neurologist, or from information provided by standardized measures of visual and divided attention. Caregivers' risk impressions (odds ratio [OR] = 13.76, p = .03) and Trail Making Test Part B (Trails B; OR = 0.41, p = .02) emerged as significant predictors of passing an on-road assessment. Our findings suggest that caregiver impressions, with a measure of set shifting, may be used as an efficient screen to identify drivers with PD who are potentially at risk for failing an on-road assessment.",

    "abstract": "This study applies diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to determine differences in neuronal integrity between motor phenotypes in Parkinson's disease.\nOne hundred and twenty-two patients (47 females, mean age = 70.3 years) were included at baseline. Forty patients were tremor dominant (TD), 64 had postural imbalance and gait difficulty (PIGD), and 18 patients were indeterminate. The DTI was repeated after one, three and 5 years, including reassessment of phenotype. DTI was quantified using fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean, radial and axial diffusion. Targeted white matter involved six regions of interests (ROIs) in prefrontal cortex (PFC), the entrance to the external capsule (EEC) and lateral to the horn of the anterior ventricle (LVAH). Grey matter involved the basal ganglia. Data were analysed using mixed linear models with P < 0.05 (Bonferroni corrected) as significance threshold.\nPIGD and Indeterminate had reduced FA and axial diffusion in PFC, EEC and LVAH compared to Tremor dominant (P < 0.05). Basal ganglia showed no differences. Post hoc analysis showed that FA correlated negatively, and mean and radial diffusion positively, to PIGD symptoms in EEC, LVAH and four ROIs in PFC (P < 0.05). Tremor symptoms showed no correlations. Patients converting to PIGD and Indeterminate had lower FA, and higher mean and radial diffusion, at baseline in EEC, LVAH and four areas in PFC compared to non-converting patients (P < 0.05).\nDegeneration in frontal white matter is connected to PIGD symptoms in Parkinson's disease and if present at an early stage, the risk for conversion to the PIGD phenotype increases.",

    "abstract": "A broad range of tremors occur in patients with essential tremor and Parkinson's disease; despite this, there are virtually no published data that focus on the patient perspective. The aims were to (1) assess the subjective experience of tremor, comparing essential tremor and Parkinson's disease patients, and (2) assess the clinical correlates of that experience (i.e., what specific clinical characteristics were associated with more experienced tremor)?\n121 essential tremor and 100 Parkinson's disease cases enrolled in a cross-sectional, clinical-epidemiological study underwent a detailed clinical assessment, which included a series of standardized questionnaires and neurological examination. The question, \"On a typical day, how many waking hours do you have tremor in any body part?\", was also administered.\nEssential tremor cases reported more than three times the median number of waking hours experiencing tremor than Parkinson's disease cases: 10.1 \u00b1 7.8 (median 10.0) vs. 5.5 \u00b1 6.3 (median 3.0) hours (p<0.001). A small number of cases (esp., essential tremor) reported spending \u226516 hours/day shaking. Greater number of hours experiencing tremor was associated with female gender, higher Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale scores, greater perceived disability and, in essential tremor, higher Essential Tremor Embarrassment Assessment scores.\nEssential tremor patients reported more than three times the median number of waking hours experiencing tremor than Parkinson's disease patients. Certain clinical characteristics tracked with more reported tremor, and the number of such hours had clear clinical ramifications - greater number of hours was associated with both psycho-social and functional consequences.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate whether combining diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) techniques would provide a sensitive method for differentiating between 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced rhesus monkey model of Parkinson's disease (PD) and wild-type controls.\nSeventeen rhesus monkeys were divided into two groups. A series of intramuscular injections of either saline (control group, n = 8) or MPTP (0.2 mg/kg body weight; PD group, n = 9) were given to the monkeys, twice a week. Then, SWI and DTI scans were obtained from the monkeys with Siemens Magnetom Verio 3.0T superconductive MRI system. Region of interest analysis was performed on substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). In addition, immunohistochemical staining of tyrosine hydroxylase was applied to assess degeneration of SN dopaminergic neurons.\nMonkeys in the PD group displayed mild to moderate motor symptoms assessed using Kurlan's scale. With SWI scans, decreased width of SNc but increased width of SNr was found in PD group monkeys compared to controls. Calculation of the ratios of widths of SNc and SNr to the anterior and posterior mesencephalic diameter also reflected narrower SNc but wider SNr than controls. Decreased SWI signal intensity of SNc and SNr suggested iron deposition in both subregions of SN. The DTI scans showed lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values in SNc of the PD group monkeys, while no change of FA values in SNr was detected. Immunohistochemical test displayed generalized loss of dopaminergic neurons in SN of PD group monkeys.\nCombining the use of DTI and SWI can provide a sensitive method for differentiating between MPTP-induced rhesus monkey model of PD and wild-type controls. This effective imaging modality might provide additional information for characteristic identification of PD at early stages, thus enhancing the ability to make early diagnosis, and monitor progression of the natural history and treatment effects.\nEl objetivo de este estudio fue evaluar si las t\u00e9cnicas de imagen por resonancia magn\u00e9tica con tensores de difusi\u00f3n (ITD) combinadas con las de imagen por susceptibilidad magn\u00e9tica ponderada (ISP), proporcionar\u00edan un m\u00e9todo sensible para diferenciar entre el modelo de la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) inducida mediante 1-metil-4-fenil-1,2,3,6-tetrahidropiridina (MPTP) en monos rhesus y los controles de tipo salvaje.\nDiecisietes monos rhesus fueron divididos en dos grupos. Dos veces por semana, los monos recibieron inyecciones intramusculares, bien de soluci\u00f3n salina (grupo control, n = 8), o MPTP (0.2 mg/kg por peso corporal; grupo EP, n = 9). Entonces, se obtuvieron escaneos por ISP y ITD de los monos, usando un sistema superconductor IRM Siemens Magnetom Verio 3.0 T. Se realiz\u00f3 un an\u00e1lisis ROI (regi\u00f3n de inter\u00e9s) de la sustancia negra pars compacta (SNc) y de la sustancia negra pars reticulata (SNr). Adem\u00e1s, se aplic\u00f3 la coloraci\u00f3n inmunohistoqu\u00edmica de la tirosina hidroxilasa con el prop\u00f3sito de evaluar la degeneraci\u00f3n de las neuronas dopamin\u00e9rgicas de la SN.\nLos monos en el grupo EP mostraron s\u00edntomas motores de leves a moderados, evaluados seg\u00fan la escala de Kurlan. En el an\u00e1lisis con ISP, se hall\u00f3 una disminuci\u00f3n del ancho de la SNc, pero un aumento de ancho de la SNr en los monos del grupo EP, en comparaci\u00f3n con los controles. El c\u00e1lculo de los cocientes de las anchuras de la SNc y la SNr en relaci\u00f3n con el di\u00e1metro mesencef\u00e1lico anterior y posterior, tambi\u00e9n reflej\u00f3 una SNc m\u00e1s estrecha pero una SNr m\u00e1s amplia que las de los controles. La disminuci\u00f3n de la intensidad de la se\u00f1al ISP de la SNc y la SNr sugiere dep\u00f3sito de hierro en ambas subregiones de la SN. Los escaneos de ITD mostraron valores de anisotrop\u00eda fraccional (FA) m\u00e1s bajos en la SNc de los monos del grupo EP, mientras que no se detectaron cambios en los valores FA en la SNr. La prueba inmunohistoqu\u00edmica mostr\u00f3 una p\u00e9rdida generalizada de las neuronas dopamin\u00e9rgicas en la SN de los monos del grupo con EP.\nCombinar el uso de ITD e ISP puede proporcionar un m\u00e9todo sensible para diferenciar entre el modelo de la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) inducida por MPTP en monos rhesus y los controles de tipo salvaje. Esta modalidad efectiva de obtenci\u00f3n de im\u00e1genes puede proporcionar informaci\u00f3n adicional para la identificaci\u00f3n de caracter\u00edsticas de la EP en etapas tempranas, aumentando as\u00ed la capacidad para hacer un diagn\u00f3stico precoz y monitorear el progreso de la historia natural y los efectos del tratamiento.",

    "abstract": "The effects of levodopa on articulatory dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease remain inconclusive. This study aimed to investigate the effects of levodopa on isolated vowel articulation and motor performance in patients with moderate to severe Parkinson's disease, excluding speech fluctuations caused by dyskinesia.\n21 patients (14 males and 7 females) and 21 age- and sex- matched healthy subjects were enrolled. Together with motor assessment, the patients phonated five Japanese isolated vowels (/a/, /i/, /u/, /e/, and /o/) 20 times before and 1 h after levodopa treatment. We made the frequency analysis of each vowel and measured the first and second formants. From these formants we constructed the pentagonal vowel space area which should be the good indicator for articulatory dysfunction of vowels. In control subjects, only speech samples were analyzed. To investigate the sequential relationship between plasma levodopa concentrations, motor performances, and acoustic measurements after treatment, entire drug cycle tests were performed in 4 patients.\nThe pentagonal vowel space area was significantly expanded together with motor amelioration after levodopa treatment, although the enlargement is not enough for the space area of control subjects. Drug cycle tests revealed that sequential increases or decreases in plasma levodopa levels after treatment correlated well with expansion or decrease of the vowel space areas and improvement or deterioration of motor manifestations.\nLevodopa expanded the vowel space area and ameliorated motor performance, suggesting that dysfunctions in vowel articulation and motor performance in patients with Parkinson's disease are based on dopaminergic pathology.",

    "abstract": "Physical therapy can improve motor function in patients with PD. Music performance may be used to improve motor skills by rhythmic entrainment. Drumming has long been a part of traditional healing rituals worldwide, and is increasingly being utilized as a therapeutic strategy.\nThis pilot controlled prospective cohort trial assessed feasibility and effects of twice-weekly group West African drum circle classes for 6 weeks on PD patients' quality of life, symptoms, motor findings, cognition, and mood. Ten patients with PD were recruited into the drum circle group. Ten patients with PD were matched pairwise to each of the drum circle participants, and enrolled in a no-intervention control group. Both groups completed the PD-specific Parkinson Disease Questionnaire (PDQ)-39 quality of life assessment and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and underwent motor and cognitive assessments by a rater blinded to group at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks.\nDrummers had significantly improved PDQ-39 scores from baseline to 6 weeks (-5.8, p=0.042), whereas the control group's scores were unchanged. Walking performance was significantly faster at baseline for controls; after 6 weeks of drumming this difference was no longer significant, and remained non-significant at 12 weeks. The drummers trended (p=0.069) toward improvement in walking from baseline to 12 weeks. Other outcomes did not significantly change from baseline to 6 or 12 weeks.\nDrum circle classes significantly and reversibly improved quality of life in patients with PD. This pilot trial's findings merit larger controlled investigations comparing drumming classes to established interventions in PD, such as physical therapy.",

    "abstract": "Low health literacy (HL) indicates a limited ability to understand and use basic information to make appropriate healthcare decisions. While low HL is associated with higher morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs in multiple chronic conditions, little is known about HL and its associations in Parkinson's disease (PD).\nCross-sectional study of non-demented adults with PD participating in the National Parkinson Foundation Parkinson's Outcomes Project at the University of Pennsylvania. Subjects were administered two brief HL assessments-the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine-Short Form (REALM-SF), a word-recognition test, and the Newest Vital Sign (NVS), a test of literacy, numeracy and understanding of health information-as well as demographic and clinical questionnaires. Adverse outcomes included falls in the 3 months preceding the study visit, and hospital admissions, emergency room visits, infections, or injuries in the preceding year. Caregiver burden was measured using the Multidimensional Caregiver Strain Index.\n168 subjects completed both HL screens (mean 65.8 years, 65.5% male, 65.2% Hoehn & Yahr Stage 2). Using the REALM-SF, 97.6% of subjects had adequate HL. Using the NVS, however, 29.8% had low HL, which was associated with older age, lower education, male gender, greater disease severity, and poorer cognition. Low HL was associated with hospital admission and increased caregiver burden.\nLow HL is common and associated with greater caregiver burden and a higher likelihood of hospitalization in patients with PD. Since HL is associated with both disease severity and adverse outcomes, it may be an important, modifiable contributor to morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies in rehabilitation of Parkinson's disease (PD) have shown that cycling on a tandem bike at a high pedaling rate can reduce the symptoms of the disease. In this research, a smart motorized bicycle has been designed and built for assisting Parkinson's patients with exercise to improve motor function. The exercise bike can accurately control the rider's experience at an accelerated pedaling rate while capturing real-time test data. Here, the design and development of the electronics and hardware as well as the software and control algorithms are presented. Two control algorithms have been developed for the bike; one that implements an inertia load (static mode) and one that implements a speed reference (dynamic mode). In static mode the bike operates as a regular exercise bike with programmable resistance (load) that captures and records the required signals such as heart rate, cadence and power. In dynamic mode the bike operates at a user-selected speed (cadence) with programmable variability in speed that has been shown to be essential to achieving the desired motor performance benefits for PD patients. In addition, the flexible and extensible design of the bike permits readily changing the control algorithm and incorporating additional I/O as needed to provide a wide range of riding experiences. Furthermore, the network-enabled controller provides remote access to bike data during a riding session.",

    "abstract": "This study determined the effects of single doses of opicapone (OPC), a novel third-generation catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, on levodopa and 3-O-methyl-levodopa (3-OMD) pharmacokinetics (PK), COMT activity and motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Subjects received, in a double-blind manner, 25, 50, and 100\u2009mg OPC or placebo (PLC) in 4 separate treatment periods. The washout period between doses was at least 10 days. During each period, the OPC/PLC capsules were to be coadministered with the morning dose of 100/25\u2009mg levodopa/carbidopa (LC) or levodopa/benserazide (LB) on day 3. In relation to PLC, levodopa exposure increased 3.7%, 16.4%, and 34.8% following 25, 50, or 100\u2009mg OPC, respectively. Maximum S-COMT inhibition (Emax ) ranged from 67.8% (25\u2009mg OPC) to 100% (100\u2009mg OPC). Peak and extent of S-COMT inhibition were dose-dependent. Maximum decrease in the plasma 3-OMD was observed following administration of 100\u2009mg OPC. Opicapone administered concomitantly with standard-release 100/25\u2009mg LC or LB improved motor performance. Treatments were generally well tolerated and safe. It was concluded that OPC is a new COMT inhibitor that significantly decreased COMT activity and increased systemic exposure to levodopa in PD patients with motor fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Evidence from clinical and pathological studies suggests a role for both alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta in the pathophysiology of dementia associated with PD. Recent work demonstrated improvement in memory and reduced amyloid-beta burden in transgenic murine Alzheimer's models given subcutaneous apomorphine. The aim of this work was to determine whether antemortem exposure to apomorphine was associated with lower levels of amyloid-beta in brain tissue in a clinicopathological study of PD.\nThe case notes of donors with pathologically proven PD who had (n\u2009=\u200936) and had not received apomorphine (n\u2009=\u200935) during life for motor complications were reviewed to determine presence or absence of cognitive impairment. The four groups were well matched for disease duration, age at death, sex, and apolipoprotein E4 genotype. The severity of amyloid-beta mature/diffuse plaque load, tau pathology, and alpha-synuclein pathology were all established. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy was determined based on a four-tier grading system.\nWithin the cognitively normal cases, significantly reduced amyloid-beta deposition was present in those with antemortem apomorphine exposure; this finding was not replicated in those with cognitive impairment plus previous apomorphine use. In the apomorphine cognitively normal group only, a significant negative association was observed between maximum apomorphine dose received and amyloid-beta burden. Early and maximum doses of apomorphine plus apolipoprotein genotype and sex were significant predictors of total plaque load in an explanatory model.\nThis exploratory study suggests that apomorphine may have a modifying effect on amyloid deposition in nondemented PD cases and thus may represent a potential therapy to reduce cognitive impairment in PD. \u00a9 2015 Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of ultrasound strain elastography (SE) for the assessment of resting biceps brachii muscle (BBM) stiffness in patients with Parkinson's diseases (PD). From May 2014 to December 2014, we prospectively performed SE of BBM in 14 patients with PD and 10 healthy controls. Based on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale for scoring muscle rigidity (UPDRS, part III), muscle rigidity scores in 14 patients with PD included 3 patients with high rigidity (UPDRS III-IV) and 11 patients with low rigidity (UPDRS I-II). Ultrasound strain was represented by the deformation of the BBM and subcutaneous soft tissues that was produced by external compression with a sand bag (1.5 kg) tied onto an ultrasound transducer. Deformation was estimated with two-dimensional speckle tracking. The difference in strain ratio (SR, defined as mean BBM strain divided by mean subcutaneous soft tissue strain) between PD and healthy controls was tested by unpaired t test. The correlation between SR and muscle rigidity score was analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficient. The reliability of SR in assessment of BBM stiffness was tested using intraclass correlation coefficient. In our result, the SR in PD and healthy controls measured 2.65\u00b10.36 and 3.30\u00b10.27, respectively. A significant difference in SR was noted between the healthy controls and PD (P=.00011). A negative correlation was found between SR and UPDRS rigidity score (r=-0.78). Our study suggests that the SR of BBM to reference tissue can be used as a quantitative biomarker in assessing resting muscle stiffness associated with muscle rigidity in PD.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to identify risk factors that influence regular exercise among patients with Parkinson's disease in Korea. Parkinson's disease is prevalent in the elderly, and may lead to a sedentary lifestyle. Exercise can enhance physical and psychological health. However, patients with Parkinson's disease are less likely to exercise than are other populations due to physical disability.\nA secondary data analysis and cross-sectional descriptive study were conducted. A convenience sample of 106 patients with Parkinson's disease was recruited at an outpatient neurology clinic of a tertiary hospital in Korea. Demographic characteristics, disease-related characteristics (including disease duration and motor symptoms), self-efficacy for exercise, balance, and exercise level were investigated. Negative binomial regression and zero-inflated negative binomial regression for exercise count data were utilized to determine factors involved in exercise.\nThe mean age of participants was 65.85 \u00b1 8.77 years, and the mean duration of Parkinson's disease was 7.23 \u00b1 6.02 years. Most participants indicated that they engaged in regular exercise (80.19%). Approximately half of participants exercised at least 5 days per week for 30 min, as recommended (51.9%). Motor symptoms were a significant predictor of exercise in the count model, and self-efficacy for exercise was a significant predictor of exercise in the zero model.\nSeverity of motor symptoms was related to frequency of exercise. Self-efficacy contributed to the probability of exercise. Symptom management and improvement of self-efficacy for exercise are important to encourage regular exercise in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "To describe the clinical features and brain imaging findings of autosomal dominant Parkinson disease (PD) associated with a recently reported mutation in SNCA.\nA Finnish family with PD in 3 successive generations, in accordance with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, was identified. We examined 2 available members of the family, the female proband and her daughter (both with early-onset PD), clinically and using dopamine transporter imaging ([(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT). A possible causative genetic defect was investigated by molecular genetic analyses.\nA heterozygous c.158C>A (p.A53E) point mutation in SNCA was revealed in both patients. The patients presented with PD clinically characterized by severe bradykinesia but with very little tremor and early onset of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. No cognitive decline or dysautonomic features have emerged during more than 5 years of follow-up. Both patients presented with a severe striatal binding defect in dopamine transporter SPECT imaging.\nThe results of this observational study add evidence to the suggestion that the p.A53E mutation in SNCA is indeed pathogenic and results in autosomal dominant PD. Bradykinesia and early onset of levodopa-induced dyskinesia are the characteristic clinical features associated with the A53E mutation, but the patients did not exhibit dementia or dysautonomia. The [(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT findings indicated a profound, symmetric dopaminergic defect, in contrast to those observed in patients with idiopathic PD.",

    "abstract": "To test the hypothesis of an increased incidence of antiparkinson drug prescribing or Parkinson disease (PD) diagnostic codes after chronic lithium treatment compared with chronic valproic acid or antidepressant treatment among older adults.\nA retrospective cohort study using healthcare administrative databases in Ontario, Canada included 1,749 lithium users, 1,787 valproic acid users, and 285,154 other antidepressant users\u2009\u2265\u200966 years old having used the drug continuously in monotherapy for at least 1 year. Outcome measures were start of (1) a dopaminergic medication (levodopa or a dopamine agonist), (2) any antiparkinson drug (levodopa, dopamine agonists, anticholinergic medication, amantadine, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors), (3) any antiparkinson drug or a diagnostic code for PD, and (4) any antiparkinson drug in the absence of a diagnostic code for PD.\nFor patients with no previous antipsychotic use, lithium monotherapy was associated with an increased incidence of dopaminergic drug use (adjusted HR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.06-3.30) and an increased incidence of antiparkinson drug use or a PD diagnosis (adjusted HR: 1. 68; 95% CI: 1.13-2.48) compared with antidepressant monotherapy.\nChronic lithium use is associated with an increased incidence of dopaminergic drug use compared with antidepressants, identifying a prescribing cascade related to lithium use in the elderly. Whether this reflects inappropriate treatment of action tremor or treatment of drug-induced parkinsonism should be addressed by a close examination of prescribing practices.",

    "abstract": "Green tea catechins have extensively been studied for their imminent role in reducing the risk of various neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Understanding the molecular interaction of these compounds with various anti-Parkinsonian drug targets is of interest. The present study is intended to explore binding modes of catechins with molecular targets having potential role in PD. Lamarckian genetic algorithm methodology was adopted for molecular docking simulations employing AutoDock 4.2 program. Toxicity potential and molecular properties responsible for good pharmacokinetic profile were calculated by Osiris property explorer and Molinspiration online toolkit, respectively. A strong correlation coefficient (r(2) = 0.893) was obtained between experimentally reported and docking predicted activities of native co-crystallized ligands of the 18 target receptors used in current study. Analysis of docked conformations revealed monoamine oxidase-B as most promising, while N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor was recognized as the least favorable target for catechins. Benzopyran skeleton with a phenyl group substituted at the 2-position and a hydroxyl (or ester) function at the 3-position has been identified as common structural requirements at majority of the targets. The present findings suggest that epigallocatechin gallate is the most promising lead to be developed as multitarget drug for the design and development of novel anti-Parkinsonian agents.",

    "abstract": "A cross-sectional study was carried out at a medical centre to determine the cognitive profiles of 30 Parkinson's disease patients with age of 69.76 \u00b1 7.39 years. Thirty-seven percent of the patients were found to be at risk for dementia. The scores on subscales of working memory and alternating verbal fluency were significantly lower in Parkinson's disease patients who were older than 77 years old. The scores on a subtest of working memory on the Parkinson's Disease Cognitive Rating Scale (PDCRS) were significantly lower in Parkinson's disease patients with a duration of illness of more than 10 years. In cognitive measurement, the subtests of verbal memory, delayed free recall and verbal fluency on the PD\u00acCRS were significantly lower in patients with less than six years of education. The patients who had difficulty with sustained attention, working memory and movement had significant anxiety and depression symptoms. In conclusion, multiple patterns in cognitive profiles influence the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease in multi-dimensional ways.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still unclear, but mutations in PRKN have provided some biological insights. The role of PRKN mutations and other genetic variation in determining the clinical features of PD remains unresolved. The aim of the study was to analyze PRKN mutations in PD and controls in the Polish population and to try to correlate between the presence of genetic variants and clinical features. We screened for PRKN mutations in 90 PD patients and 113 controls and evaluated clinical features in these patients. We showed that in the Polish population 4% of PD patients had PRKN mutations (single or with additional polymorphism) while single heterozygous polymorphisms (S167N, E310D, D394N) of PRKN were present in 21% of sporadic PD. Moreover, 5% PD patients had more than one PRKN change (polymorphisms and mutations). Detected PRKN variants moderately correlated with PD course and response to L-dopa. It also showed that other PARK genes (SNCA, HTRA2, SPR) mutations probably may additionally influence PD risk and clinical features. PRKN variants are relatively common in our Polish series of patients with PD. Analysis of the PRKN gene may be useful in determining clinical phenotype, and helping with diagnostic and prognostic procedures in the future.",

    "abstract": "Postural instability is one of most disabling motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Indices of multi-muscle synergies are new measurements of movement and postural stability.\nMulti-muscle synergies stabilizing vertical posture were studied in Parkinson's disease patients without clinical symptoms of postural instability (Hoehn-Yahr \u2264 II) and age-matched controls. We tested the hypothesis that both synergy indices during quiet standing and synergy adjustments to self-triggered postural perturbations would be reduced in patients.\nEleven Parkinson's disease patients and 11 controls performed whole-body tasks while standing. Surface electromyography was used to quantify synergy indices stabilizing center of pressure shifts in the anterior-posterior direction during a load-release task.\nParkinson's disease patients showed a significantly lower percentage of variance in the muscle activation space accounted for by the first four principal components, significantly reduced synergy indices during steady state, and significantly reduced anticipatory synergy adjustments (a drop in the synergy index prior to the self-triggered unloading).\nThe study demonstrates for the first time that impaired synergic control in Parkinson's disease can be quantified in postural tasks, even in patients without clinical manifestations of postural instability. Synergy measurements may provide a biomarker sensitive for early problems with postural stability in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Axial rigidity and postural instability in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) may contribute to turning difficulty. This study examined the rotation of axial segments and gait instability during turning in people with PD.\nThirteen PD and twelve age-matched healthy adults were recruited. Participants performed the timed Up-and-Go test and were recorded by a 3D motion capture system. Axial rotation was evaluated by the rotation onset of the head, thorax and pelvis. Gait stability was evaluated by the center of mass and center of pressure inclination angle. Turning performance was evaluated by turning time and turning steps.\nDuring turning, PD adults rotated the head, thorax and pelvis simultaneously, whereas healthy adults rotated in a cranial to caudal sequence. Further, PD adults had a smaller sagittal inclination angle (p<0.001) but larger frontal inclination angle (p=0.006) than healthy adults. PD adults also turned slower (p=0.002) with a greater number of steps (p<0.001) than healthy adults. Last, PD adults showed a significant correlation between the sagittal inclination angle and turning steps (Spearman's \u03c1=-0.63), while healthy adults showed a significant correlation between frontal inclination angle and turning steps (Spearman's \u03c1=-0.67).\nThis study demonstrated the axial rigidity in PD adults during turning may reduce forward progression and increase lateral instability. The reduced progression is associated with extra turning steps and the increased lateral instability may result in great fall risk.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) remains one of the most common debilitating aspects of Parkinson's disease and has been linked to injuries, falls and reduced quality of life. Although commercially available portable cueing devices exist claiming to assist with overcoming freezing; their immediate effectiveness in overcoming gait initiation failure is currently unknown. This study investigated the effects of three different types of cueing device in people with Parkinson's disease who experience freezing.\nTwenty participants with idiopathic Parkinson's disease who experienced freezing during gait but who were able to walk short distances indoors independently were recruited. At least three attempts at gait initiation were recorded using a 10 camera Qualisys motion analysis system and four force platforms. Test conditions were; Laser Cane, sound metronome, vibrating metronome, walking stick and no intervention.\nDuring testing 12 of the 20 participants had freezing episodes, from these participants 100 freezing and 91 non-freezing trials were recorded. Clear differences in the movement patterns were seen between freezing and non-freezing episodes. The Laser Cane was most effective cueing device at improving the forwards/backwards and side to side movement and had the least number of freezing episodes. The walking stick also showed significant improvements compared to the other conditions. The vibration metronome appeared to disrupt movement compared to the sound metronome at the same beat frequency.\nThis study identified differences in the movement patterns between freezing episodes and non-freezing episodes, and identified immediate improvements during gait initiation when using the Laser Cane over the other interventions.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Parkinson's disease (PD), which severely affects patient functioning and quality of life and increases the risk for nursing home admission. Unfortunately, current treatment options for PDD are limited and have only marginal therapeutic effects. As novel treatments are developed, there will be a need to assess their efficacy in well-designed randomized controlled trials. However, there is no consensus on the optimal outcome measures for use in PDD clinical trials.\nA systematic review of PDD clinical trials and empiric studies of outcome measures used in PDD was performed. Outcome measures were divided into five categories: 1) cognitive; 2) behavioral and mood; 3) activities of daily living and quality of life; 4) global; and 5) caregiver burden.\nA total of 20 PDD pharmacologic clinical trials were identified. These trials incorporated a broad array of outcome measures, which were used inconsistently across trials. We summarize the psychometric properties and other relevant data on outcome measures used, including their diagnostic utility, inter-rater reliability, test-retest reliability, responsiveness, clinically meaningful change, and availability of alternate forms.\nWe have identified the best-evidenced PDD outcome measures in each domain. Further research is needed to assess the validity, reliability, and clinically meaningful change of these measures in PDD to inform the design of future clinical trials and enhance the ability of clinicians, researchers and policy-makers to interpret study results. In addition, the development of outcome measures specific to PDD may be warranted.",

    "abstract": "As the most common neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are two of the main health concerns for the elderly population. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been used as biomarkers of infectious, genetic, and metabolic diseases in humans but they have not been well studied in domestic animals. Here we describe a computational biology study in which human AD- and PD-associated miRNAs (ADM and PDM) were utilized to predict orthologous miRNAs in the following domestic animal species: dog, cow, pig, horse, and chicken. In this study, a total of 121 and 70 published human ADM and PDM were identified, respectively. Thirty-seven miRNAs were co-regulated in AD and PD. We identified a total of 105 unrepeated human ADM and PDM that had at least one 100% identical animal homolog, among which 81 and 54 showed 100% sequence identity with 241 and 161 domestic animal miRNAs, respectively. Over 20% of the total mature horse miRNAs (92) showed perfect matches to AD/PD-associated miRNAs. Pigs, dogs, and cows have similar numbers of AD/PD-associated miRNAs (63, 62, and 59). Chickens had the least number of perfect matches (34). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses suggested that humans and dogs are relatively similar in the functional pathways of the five selected highly conserved miRNAs. Taken together, our study provides the first evidence for better understanding the miRNA-AD/PD associations in domestic animals, and provides guidance to generate domestic animal models of AD/PD to replace the current rodent models.",

    "abstract": "The majority of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience voice and speech difficulties at some point over the course of the disease. Voice therapy has been found to help improve voice and speech in individuals with PD, but the majority of these individuals do not enroll in voice therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether watching short videos about voice symptoms and treatment in Parkinson's disease influences readiness to change, stages of change, and self-efficacy in individuals with PD. Eight individuals with PD participated in the study. Fifteen videos were chosen, three representing each of the five stages of change. We chose videos from YouTube that represented variety in speakers, content, and genre. We found that readiness to change significantly increased after watching videos, suggesting that watching videos helped these individuals move closer to actively improving their voice and speech. In addition, five of the eight participants showed forward movement in stages of change. Finally, self-efficacy demonstrated a positive trend following video watching. Overall, our results demonstrate that watching videos available on the internet can influence individuals with Parkinson's disease in changing vocal behavior. Implications for future wireless health applications are described.",

    "abstract": "Radiofrequency ablation has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment strategy for the management of symptomatic patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. It is supported by a success rate of 95% and a recurrence rate of less than 5%. However, ablation of accessory pathways can be challenging at times. The causes for failure can be grouped into three categories - unusual location of the pathway, technical difficulties in delivering the ablation and localization error [1]. In this case report we are reporting a case of a young male who presented to us with symptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with two failed prior ablations at another institution. This case illustrates the importance of knowing accurate localization and course of the accessory pathway by utilizing the unipolar and bipolar electrograms simultaneously during radiofrequency ablation.",

    "abstract": "LRSAM1 mutations have been found in recessive and dominant forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Within one generation of the original Dutch family in which the dominant LRSAM1 mutation was identified, three of the five affected family members have developed Parkinson's disease between ages 50 and 65 years, many years after neuropathy onset. We speculate that this late-onset parkinsonism is part of the LRSAM1 phenotype, thus associating a hitherto peripheral nerve disease with a central nervous system phenotype. How the mutated Lrsam1 protein, which normally has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and is expressed in the nervous system, impacts on substantia nigra neurons is unclear.",

    "abstract": "In this study, microstructural brain damage in Parkinson's disease patients was examined using diffusion tensor imaging and tract-based spatial statistics. The analyses revealed the presence of neuronal damage in the substantia nigra and putamen in the Parkinson's disease patients. Moreover, disease symptoms worsened with increasing damage to the substantia nigra, confirming that the substantia nigra and basal ganglia are the main structures affected in Parkinson's disease. We also found that microstructural damage to the putamen, caudate nucleus and frontal lobe positively correlated with depression. Based on the tract-based spatial statistics, various white matter tracts appeared to have microstructural damage, and this correlated with cognitive disorder and depression. Taken together, our results suggest that diffusion tensor imaging and tract-based spatial statistics can be used to effectively study brain function and microstructural changes in patients with Parkinson's disease. Our novel findings should contribute to our understanding of the histopathological basis of cognitive dysfunction and depression in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease resulting from the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Increasing evidence demonstrated that mice treated intranasally with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) suffered impairments in motor functions associated with disruption of DA neurons in SNc conceivably analogous to those observed in PD. L-arginine has been proposed as a novel neuroprotective agent that plays protective roles in several models of neuronal cellular damage. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of L-arginine on the numerical density of dark neurons (DNs) in the SNc of Balb/c mice subjected to MPTP administration.\nIn the present study, we demonstrated that repeated treatment with L-arginine (300 mg/kg, i.p.) during 7 consecutive days attenuated the production of DNs in SNc of adult male Balb/c mice infused with a single intranasal administration of MPTP (1 mg/nostril).\nPre-treatment with L-arginine significantly decreased the numerical density of DNs in SNc of mice 21 days after intranasal MPTP administration.\nThis investigation provides new insights in experimental models of PD, indicating that L-arginine represents a potential neuroprotective agent for the prevention of DA neuron degeneration in SNc observed in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Transplantation of dopamine- (DA-) rich foetal ventral mesencephalic cells emerged as a promising therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), as it allowed significant improvement of motor symptoms in several PD patients in open-label studies. However, double-blind clinical trials have been largely disappointing. The general agreement in the field is that the lack of standardization of tissue collection and preparation, together with the absence of postsurgical immunosuppression, played a key role in the failure of these studies. Moreover, a further complication that emerged in previous studies is the appearance of the so-called graft-induced dyskinesia (GID), in a subset of grafted patients, which resembles dyskinesia induced by L-DOPA but in the absence of medication. Preclinical evidence pointed to the serotonin neurons as possible players in the appearance of GID. In agreement, clinical investigations have shown that grafted tissue may contain a large number of serotonin neurons, in the order of half of the DA cells; moreover, the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist buspirone has been found to produce significant dampening of GID in grafted patients. In this paper, we will review the recent preclinical and clinical studies focusing on cell transplantation for PD and on the mechanisms underlying GID.",

    "abstract": "A number of transcription factors, including En1/2, Foxa1/2, Lmx1a/b, Nurr1, Otx2, and Pitx3, with key roles in midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuron development, also regulate adult mDA neuron survival and physiology. Mouse models with targeted disruption of some of these genes display several features reminiscent of Parkinson disease (PD), in particular the selective and progressive loss of mDA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The characterization of these animal models has provided valuable insights into various mechanisms of PD pathogenesis. Therefore, the dissection of the mechanisms and survival signalling pathways engaged by these transcription factors to protect mDA neuron from degeneration can suggest novel therapeutic strategies. The work on En1/2-mediated neuroprotection also highlights the potential of protein transduction technology for neuroprotective approaches in PD.",

    "abstract": "We recently reported that treatment with naringin, a major flavonoid found in grapefruit and citrus fruits, attenuated neurodegeneration in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) in vivo. In order to investigate whether its effects are universally applied to a different model of PD and whether its treatment induces restorative effects on the lesioned nigrostriatal dopaminergic (DA) projection, we observed the effects of pre-treatment or post-treatment with naringin in a mouse model of PD. For neuroprotective effects, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was unilaterally injected into the striatum of mouse brains for a neurotoxin model of PD in the presence or absence of naringin by daily intraperitoneal injection. Our results showed that naringin protected the nigrostriatal DA projection from 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, similar to the effects in rat brains, this treatment induced the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is well known as an important survival factor for DA neurons, and inhibited microglial activation in the substantia nigra (SN) of mouse brains treated with 6-OHDA. However, there was no significant change of DA phenotypes in the SN and striatum post-treated with naringin compared with 6-OHDA-lesioned mice, despite the treatment being continued for 12 weeks. These results suggest that post-treatment with naringin alone may not be enough to restore the nigrostriatal DA projection in a mouse model of PD. However, our results apparently suggest that naringin is a beneficial natural product to prevent DA degeneration, which is involved in PD.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive condition with gait disturbance and balance disorder as the main symptoms. Previous research studies focused on the application of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) in PD gait rehabilitation. The key hypothesis of this pilot study, however, assumes the major role of the combination of all three Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT) sensorimotor techniques in improving spatio-temporal gait parameters, and postural stability in the course of PD. The 55 PD-diagnosed subjects invited to the study were divided into two groups: 30 in the experimental and 25 in the control group. Inclusion criteria included Hoehn and Yahr stages 2 or 3, the ability to walk independently without any aid and stable pharmacological treatment for the duration of the experiment. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the chosen therapy procedure the following measures were applied: Optoelectrical 3D Movement Analysis, System BTS Smart for gait, and Computerized Dynamic Posturography CQ Stab for stability and balance. All measures were conducted both before and after the therapy cycle. The subjects from the experimental group attended music therapy sessions four times a week for 4 weeks. Therapeutic Instrumental Music Performance (TIMP), Pattern Sensory Enhancement (PSE) and RAS were used in every 45-min session for practicing daily life activities, balance, pre-gait, and gait pattern. Percussion instruments, the metronome and rhythmic music were the basis for each session. The subjects from the control group were asked to stay active and perform daily life activities between the measures. The research showed that the combination of the three NMT sensorimotor techniques can be used to improve gait and other rhythmical activities in PD rehabilitation. The results demonstrated significant improvement in the majority of the spatiotemporal gait parameters in the experimental group in comparison to the control group. In the stability tests with eyes closed, substantial differences were revealed, indicating improvement of proprioception (the sense of body position and movement). These findings suggest a new compensatory strategy for movement and postural control through the use of the auditory system.",

    "abstract": "Existing quality-of-life instruments for Parkinson's disease (PD) may not fully assess quality of life (QoL) for people with PD in a holistic and multidimensional manner. This study examines the subscale structure, validity, and internal-consistency reliability of the McGill Quality of Life (MQoL) Questionnaire in a sample of people with PD. This cross-sectional study evaluates the MQoL-PD by using Cronbach's alpha and principal components analysis. A total of 81 consenting people with PD from a tertiary care outpatient clinic were studied. Scores were tabulated for the motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (mUPDRS), the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), the MQoL Single-Item Scale (MQoL-SIS), and the MQoL Questionnaire (MQoL). Cronbach's alpha for the MQoL-PD was: physical symptoms, 0.83; psychological symptoms, 0.59; and existential/support symptoms, 0.76. Important contributors to QoL in PD include mobility, bowel and bladder function, fatigue, and pain. The MQoL Questionnaire is a valid and reliable measure of physical, psychological, and existential/support symptoms for people with PD.",

    "abstract": "Sporadic Parkinson's disease is a widespread human disease that has never been reported in non-human vertebrates. The etiopathogenesis of the non-motor symptoms in the disease is not well understood and it is difficult to interpret the roles of affected neurotransmitters in currently available animal models. Most of the non-motor symptoms do not correlate with the stage of motor deficits and precede the development of motor symptoms by many years, before the permanent loss of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia. The aim of this review is to briefly summarize the advantages and limitations of the well-recognized mammalian animal models with special regard to the non-motor complications of the prodromal and early stage Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily associated with two dominant features: cardinal motor symptoms and the loss of cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the basal ganglia. Consequently, these aspects are major foci in PD-related research. However, PD is a neurodegenerative disease, which progressively affects multiple brain regions outside the basal ganglia and leads to symptoms outside the motor domain. Much less is known about the individual contribution of these secondary regions, their interplay and interaction with the basal ganglia, and the respective network dynamics in the overall manifestation of PD. These regions include classical motor structures such as the cerebellum and the supplementary motor area (SMA). However, just as the basal ganglia, these regions display a fine-grained microarchitecture, which supports sensory and sensorimotor functions. One such function is temporal processing, which has been ascribed to a network comprising all of these regions. On the one hand, pathological changes in this temporal processing network may be part and parcel of motor and non-motor symptoms in PD. On the other hand, a better understanding of the role of each network node may offer a novel perspective on compensatory mechanisms, therapeutic interventions, as well as the heterogeneity and individual differences associated with PD. We unfold this perspective by relating the neural foundations and functional implications of temporal processing to pathophysiological and neurofunctional changes characteristic of PD.",

Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta, whose loss results in the clinical symptoms associated with PD, are particularly susceptible to inflammatory damage and oxidative stress. Inflammation in the striatum, where SN dopaminergic neurons project, is also a feature of PD brains. It is not known whether inflammatory changes occur first in striatum or SN. Many animal models of PD have implicated certain inflammatory molecules with dopaminergic cell neuronal loss; however, there have been few studies to validate these findings by measuring the levels of these and other inflammatory factors in human PD brain samples. This study also included samples from incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD) cases, since ILBD is considered a non-symptomatic precursor to PD, with subjects having significant loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-producing neurons. We hypothesized that there may be a progressive change in key inflammatory factors in ILBD samples intermediate between neurologically normal and PD. To address this, we used a quantitative antibody-array platform (Raybiotech-Quantibody arrays) to measure the levels of 160 different inflammation-associated cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and related molecules in extracts of SN and striatum from clinically and neuropathologically characterized PD, ILBD, and normal control cases. Patterns of changes in inflammation and related molecules were distinctly different between SN and striatum. Our results showed significantly different levels of interleukin (IL)-5, IL-15, monokine induced by gamma interferon, and IL-6 soluble receptor in SN between disease groups. A different panel of 13 proteins with significant changes in striatum, with IL-15 as the common feature, was identified. Although the ability to detect some proteins was limited by sensitivity, patterns of expression indicated involvement of certain T-cell cytokines, vascular changes, and loss of certain growth factors, with disease progression. The results demonstrate the feasibility of profiling inflammatory molecules using diseased human brain samples, and have provided additional targets to validate in relation to PD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Animal models have contributed a large part to our understanding and therapeutics developed for treatment of PD. There are several more exhaustive reviews of literature that provide the initiated insights into the specific models; however a novel synthesis of the basic advantages and disadvantages of different models is much needed. Here we compare both neurotoxin based and genetic models while suggesting some novel avenues in PD modeling. We also highlight the problems faced and promises of all the mammalian models with the hope of providing a framework for comparison of various systems.",

    "abstract": "[Purpose] To investigate the role of external cues on arm swing amplitude and trunk rotation in Parkinson's disease. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 13 elderly patients with Parkinson's disease. Subjects walked under four different conditions in a random order: no cue, visual cue, auditory cue, and combined cue. The auditory cue velocity consisted of a metronome beat 20% greater than the subject's general gait speed. For the visual cue condition, bright yellow colored strips of tape placed on the floor at intervals equal to 40% of each subject's height. A motion analysis system was used to measure arm swing amplitude and trunk rotation during walking. [Results] There was a significant difference in the kinematic variables (arm swing amplitude) between different cues, but there was not a significant difference in the kinematic variables with respect to the trunk rotation. [Conclusion] The findings of this study indicate that patients with Parkinson's disease are likely to focus attention on auditory cues. The measurement of arm and trunk kinematics during gait by auditory cues can increase the available methods for the analysis of complex motor programs in movement disorders.",

    "abstract": "[Purpose] The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between gait speed and various factors in ambulatory patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. [Subjects] Fifty ambulatory patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease who were admitted to an outpatient clinic were included in this cross-sectional study. [Methods] The Hoehn and Yahr Scale was used for measurement of the disease severity. Gait speed was measured by the 10-Meter Walk Test. Mobility status was assessed by Timed Up and Go Test. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used for evaluation of emotional state. Cognitive status was examined with the Mini-Mental State Examination. The Downton Index was used for fall risk assessment. Balance was evaluated with the Berg Balance Scale. Comorbidity was measured with the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale. The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey was completed for measurement of quality of life. [Results] The mean age was 66.7 (47-83) years. Twenty-eight (56%) patients were men. Gait speed was correlated positively with height, male gender, Mini-Mental Examination score, Berg Balance Scale score and physical summary scores of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. On the other hand, there was a negative correlation between gait speed and age, disease severity, TUG time, Downton Index, fear of falling, previous falls and the anxiety and depression scores of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. There was no correlation between gait speed and comorbidity. [Conclusion] The factors related with the slower gait speed are, elder age, clinically advanced disease, poor mobility, fear of falling, falling history, higher falling risk, and mood disorder.",

    "abstract": "Several antecedent studies had reported close relationship between low body weight and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there have been few investigations about the role of body weight to nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This study enrolled 398 de novo patients with PD whom underwent [18F] N-(3-Fluoropropyl)-2\u03b2-carbon ethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane positron emission tomography scan and body mass index (BMI) measurement. The relationships between BMI and dopamine transporter (DAT) activity were analyzed using linear regression analysis. A multivariate analysis adjusted for age, gender, disease duration, smoking status, coffee and tea consumption, and residence area revealed that BMI remained independently and significantly associated with DAT activity in all striatal subregions. Moreover, multiple logistic regression analyses showed that BMI was a significant predictor for the lowest quartile of DAT activity in the anterior putamen, ventral striatum, caudate nucleus, and total striatum. The present findings suggest that a low BMI might be closely associated with low density of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in PD, which could support the evidence for the role of low body weight to PD-related pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Striatal dopamine depletion is a key pathophysiological feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) causing motor and nonmotor symptoms. Research on nonmotor symptoms has mainly focused on frontostriatal functions. However, dopamine pathways ascending from the ventral tegmental area also innervate hippocampal structures and modulate hippocampal-dependent functions, such as spatial memory. Using a virtual spatial navigation task, we investigated dopaminergic modulation of spatial memory in PD patients in a crossover medication ON/OFF design. We examined medication effects on striatal- and hippocampal-dependent spatial memory by either replacing a location cue in the environment or enlarging its spatial boundary. Key results indicate that in contrast to prior evidence for younger adults, PD patients, like their age-matched controls, rely more on striatal cue-based than hippocampal spatial learning. Medication facilitated striatal-dependent cue-location learning, whereas medication benefit in hippocampal boundary-related spatial memory depended on prior experience with the task. Medication effects on spatial memory were comparable to and independent of benefits on motor symptoms. These findings shed new light on dopaminergic modulation of hippocampal-striatal functions in PD.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to illustrate the effects of electroacupuncture on cognitive function in rats with Parkinson's disease (PD). The PD model was established by injecting 6-OHDA into the rat brain. Rats with PD were then subjected to electroacupuncture and levodopa treatment for 2 weeks. The level of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in rat brain homogenates was assessed, for the cerebral cholinergic system is a major chemical pathway consisting of cognitive functions. Immunohistochemistry was applied to observe ChAT expression in the rat hippocampus and corpus striatum. The effects of electroacupuncture on cognitive function were comprehensively assessed in PD rats using Y-maze test. Compared with model control group, electroacupuncture group were apparently improved in learning & memory abilities, and ChAT activity was elevated, and apoptosis was reduced in the rat hippocampus and corpus striatum. No significant differences in learning & memory abilities and ChAT activity were detected between electroacupuncture and levodopa groups. Electroacupuncture remarkably improved cognition in PD rats, and its mechanisms are possibly associated with protecting cholinergic neurons in the central nervous system and elevating ChAT activity, and also might suitable dosage of levodopa protect physiologically the cognitive function in PD rats.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one common neurodegenerative disease featured with degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra. Multiple factors participate in the pathogenesis and progression of PD. In this study, we investigated the proteomics profiles of mononuclear cells in cerebrospinal fluids from both PD patients and normal people, in order to explore the correlation between disease factors and PD. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected from both PD and normal people and were separated for mononuclear cells in vitro. Proteins were then extracted and separated by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Proteins with differential expressions were identified by comparison to standard proteome expression profile map, followed by software and database analysis. In PD patients, there were 8 proteins with consistent expression profile and 16 proteins with differential expressions. Those differential proteins identified include cytoskeleton proteins (actin, myosin), signal transduction proteins (adenosine cyclase binding protein 1, calcium binding protein, talin) and anti-oxidation factor (thioredoxin peroxide reductase). PD patients had differential protein expressional profiles in the mononuclear cells of cerebrospinal fluids compared to normal people, suggesting the potential involvement of cytoskeleton and signal transduction proteins in apoptosis of neuronal apoptosis and PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The recently published \"EarlyStim\" study demonstrated that deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) with early fluctuations is superior to the optimal pharmacological treatment in improving the quality of life and motor symptoms, and preserving sociocultural position. Our retrospective investigation aimed to evaluate if DBS therapy was able to preserve the working capabilities of our patients.\nWe reviewed the data of 39 young (< 60 years-old) PD patients who underwent subthalamic DBS implantation at University of P\u00e9cs and had at least two years follow-up. Patients were categorized into two groups based on their working capabilities: Patients with active job (\"Job+\" group, n = 15) and retired patients (without active job, \"Job-\" group, n = 24). Severity of motor symptoms (UPDRS part 3), quality of life (EQ-5D) and presence of active job were evaluated one and two years after the operation.\nAs far as the severity of motor symptoms were concerned, similar (approximately 50%) improvement was achieved in both groups. However, the postoperative quality of life was significantly better in the Job+ group. Majority (12/15, 80%) of Job+ group members were able to preserve their job two years after the operation. However, only a minimal portion (1/24, 4.2%) of the Job- group members was able to return to the world of active employees (p < 0.01, McNemar test).\nAlthough our retrospective study has several limitations, our results fit well with the conclusions of \"EarlyStim\" study. Both of them suggest that with optimal timing of DBS implantation we may preserve the working capabilities of our patients.",

    "abstract": "Background. Prognosis of PD is variable. Most studies show higher mortality rates in PD patients compared to the general population. Clinical and epidemiologic factors predicting mortality are poorly understood. Methods. Clinical and epidemiologic features including patient history and physical, functional, and cognitive scores were collected from a hospital-based cohort of PD patients using standardized protocols and clinical scales. Data on comorbidities and mortality were collected on follow-up. Results. During a mean follow-up of 4.71 years (range 1-10), 43 (20.9%) of the 206 patients died. Those who died had higher mean age at disease onset than those still alive at the last follow-up (67.7 years versus 56.3 years; p < 0.01). In the univariate analysis, age at baseline was associated with decreased survival. In the adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, age at disease onset and race/ethnicity were predictors of mortality. Conclusions. Late age at disease onset and advanced chronological age are associated with decreased survival. Comorbidities and PD characteristics were not associated with decreased survival in our sample. Race/ethnicity was found in our study to be associated with increased hazard of mortality. Our findings indicate the importance of studying survival among different populations of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Autonomic dysfunctions are the most common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and often precede the motor symptoms of the disease. Autonomic dysfunction may be a dominant symptom of the advanced stages of PD as well as a major cause of patient disability. Despite the wide use of neurostimulation in clinical practice, the effect of deep brain stimulation of subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) on autonomic symptoms of PD still remains only partially understood. The aim of the study is evaluation of heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) in patients with PD before STN DBS and following bilateral STN DBS.\nThe study included 25 subjects aged between 31 and 71 years, diagnosed with the idiopathic PD and selected for treatment with STN DBS. All the patients were in advanced stages of PD, disease duration ranged from 5 to 22 years. The patients enrolled into this study underwent STN DBS. Neurological examination including assessment of the severity of parkinsonism according to UPDRS scale, a psychological examination and an electrophysiological examination of autonomic disturbances based on heart rate and blood pressure variability were conducted on all patients two weeks before and three months after STN DBS.\nAfter STN DBS an improvement in terms of the analyzed parts of the UPDRS has been shown. The improvement of motor disorders assessed by III part UPDRS during the \"off\" medication/stimulation \"on\" was 67.8%. Orthostatic hypotension before the STN DBS procedure was observed in 56% of patients and after STN DBS in 53% of them. Before STN DBS the imbalance of the sympathetic--parasympathetic components with the predominance of the sympathetic based on HRV parameters--the ratio LF/HF-RRI (2.5) and a higher rate of LFnu (61.3%) than HFnu (38.6%) has been shown. Three months post STN DBS an increase parameters of spectral analysis of HRV in the low frequency LF-RRI, and high-frequency HF-RRI and the total power spectrum PSD-RRI was observed. After STN DBS an increase of parameters of spectral analysis of systolic BPV, very low frequency VLF-sBP, low frequency LF-sBP and total power spectrum PSD-sBP was noted.\nResults of the study suggest that STN DBS is an effective treatment method of both motor symptoms and autonomic dysfunctions. The disturbances of HRV and BPV before and after STN DBS indicate the increase of autonomic system activity with sympathetic dominance.",

    "abstract": "To study the changes of plasma levels of oxidative stress biomarkers in patients with parkinson's disease (PD), and to explore its association with cognition function.\nSeventy-two PD patients from June 2013 to May 2012 were enrolled. All of them were outpatients or inpatients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. And forty-five age- and gender- matched healthy subjects were used as controls. The information including gender, age, illness duration, years of education and Hoehn & Yahr (H-Y) stage were recorded. Cognition function of all the patients with PD and the controls were measured by using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale. Plasma levels of catalase (CAT), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), total glutathione (T-GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by ELISA . Then we compared and analyzed the results.\nPlasma levels of CAT, T-SOD and T-GSH in PD group were significantly lower than the control group [(159 \u00b1 9) kU/L vs (170 \u00b1 5) kU/L, P< 0.01; (97 \u00b1 24) kU/L vs (124 \u00b1 25) kU/L, P<0.01; (17 \u00b1 10) \u00b5mol/L vs (60 \u00b1 51) \u00b5mol/L, P< 0.01]. Plasma levels of CAT, T-GSH, GSH-Px and MDA were no differences between early PD group (H-Y stage I-II) and middle-late PD group (H-Y stage III or higher) of patients (P>0.05). Plasma levels of T-GSH in PD group with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were obviously lower than PD group without MCI [(14 \u00b1 7) \u00b5mol/L vs (19 \u00b1 11) \u00b5mol/L, P< 0.05]. In PD patients, MoCA scores were positively correlated with years of education (\u03b2=0.634, P= 0.000) and plasma levels of T-GSH (\u03b2= 0.204, P= 0.014), and were negatively correlated with H-Y stage (\u03b2=-0.194, P=0.020).\nThe damage of plasma antioxidant mechanism may be involved in the pathogenesis of patients with PD. Decrease in plasma levels of T-GSH may be associated with MCI in PD patients . Plasma levels of T-GSH may be a potential early predictive index in PD patients with cognitive dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "To investigate gray matter (GM) and cortical thickness (CTh) changes in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with and without Impulse Control Disorders (ICDs).\nFifteen patients with PD with ICDs (ICD+), 15 patients with PD without ICDs (ICD-) and 24 age and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in the study. Patients were screened for ICDs by the Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview (MIDI) and underwent an extensive neuropsychological evaluation. Whole brain structural imaging was performed on a 3T GE MR scanner. Surface-based investigation of CTh was carried out by using Freesurfer Software. We also used voxel-based morphometry to investigate the pattern of GM atrophy.\nThe voxel-wise analysis of the regional differences in CTh revealed that ICD+ patients showed a statistically significant (p<0.01 FDR) thicker cortex when compared to both ICD- patients and HCs in the anterior cingulate (ACC) and orbitofrontal (OFC) cortices. Moreover, cortical thickness abnormalities were positively correlated with ICD severity (p<0.05 FDR). VBM data did not reveal any statistically significant differences in local GM.\nOur results demonstrate that ICD+ patients have an increased CTh in limbic regions when compared with ICD- patients at the same disease stage and with an equal daily levodopa equivalent dose. These corticometric changes may play a role in the lack of inhibition of compulsive behaviors. The presence of such structural abnormalities may result from a synergistic effect of dopaminergic therapy in patients with a pre-existing vulnerability to develop an abnormal behavioral response to external stimuli.",

A multiple gradient echo MRI sequence provided an index of basal ganglia iron content.\nThere were significant baseline differences between those who developed freezing (n=7) and those who did not (n=12) in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores, time to complete a 14 m walk and timed up and go. There was a significant correlation between the measured change in transverse relaxation in the lateral substantia nigra pars compacta and the change in motor score from baseline to 36 months (p=0.002). The freezing group showed a greater change in motor score and iron content than did the non-freezing group.\nIndividuals destined to develop freezing early in PD have more motor impairment at baseline, more rapid deterioration in motor function, and pars compacta changes suggestive of increased iron content in comparison to those who do not.",

    "abstract": "A specific non-motor impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) concerns difficulties to accurately identify facial emotions. Findings are numerous but very inconsistent, ranging from general discrimination deficits to problems for specific emotions up to no impairment at all. By contrast, only a few studies exist about emotion experience, altered affective traits and states in PD.\nTo investigate the decoding capacity for affective facial expressions, affective experience of emotion-eliciting images and affective personality traits in PD.\nThe study sample included 25 patients with mild to moderate symptom intensity and 25 healthy controls (HC) of both sexes. The participants were shown pictures of facial expressions depicting disgust, fear, and anger as well as disgusting and fear-relevant scenes. Additionally, they answered self-report scales for the assessment of affective traits.\nPD patients had more problems in controlling anger and disgust feelings than HC. Higher disgust sensitivity in PD was associated with lower functioning in everyday life and lower capacity to recognize angry faces. Furthermore, patients reported less disgust towards poor hygiene and spoiled food and they stated elevated anxiety. However, the clinical group displayed intact facial emotion decoding and emotion experience. Everyday life functionality was lowered in PD and decreased with stronger motor impairment. Furthermore, disease duration was negatively associated to correct classification of angry faces.\nOur data indicate that problems with emotion regulation may appear already in earlier disease stages of PD. By contrast, PD patients showed appropriate emotion recognition and experience. However, data also point to a deterioration of emotion recognition capacity with the course of the disease. Compensatory mechanisms in PD patients with less advanced disease are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The Parkinson's Disease--Cognitive Functional Rating Scale (PD-CFRS) was designed to avoid motor biases in capturing the functional impact of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD). Its performance capturing functional impairment in other conditions leading to cognitive dysfunction is unknown. We compare it with non-specific Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scales.\nTwo hundred consecutive patients diagnosed in a community hospital with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [31 MCI-amnestic; 33 MCI-multi-domain; 33 PD-MCI] and dementia [35 Alzheimer's disease; 34 vascular dementia; 34 PD with dementia] were assessed on the PD-CFRS, the Blessed Dementia Scale (BDS), the Clinical Dementia Rating--Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB), and given a comprehensive cognitive assessment. Diagnostic accuracy and optimal cut-off scores were calculated for the PD-CFRS and compared with each functional measure.\nThe PD-CFRS presented high concurrent validity and significant correlation with both BDS and CDR-SOB, and cognitive scores offering a similar discrimination accuracy to non-specific scales [PD-CFRS \u2265 9 (sensitivity= 0.94; specificity = 0.95)]. No changes appear in cut-off scores when excluding PD patients. Effect size analysis indicated no relevant interference with PD-CFRS scores between the principal cognitive subgroups.\nThe findings extend the clinimetric properties of the PD-CFRS and indicate it as an adequate instrument to capture the full spectrum of functional consequences of cognitive decline in the community.",

    "abstract": "Differential diagnosis of tremor disorders, including essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease-tremor dominant type (PD-TDT), requires further investigation. Therefore, the current study aimed to compare non-motor and tremor features in order to differentiate between ET and PD-TDT.\nTwenty-eight patients with classic ET and 24 patients with typical PD-TDT were retrospectively enrolled in a multi-stage investigation process. Tremor features including surface electromyogram (EMG) were analyzed in detail. For non-motor symptom analyses, the global cognition test, frontal function test, and non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS) were administered, in addition to collecting patient history data.\nPatients with PD-TDT presented with more asymmetric tremor, whereas patients with ET presented with more symmetric tremor. Leg tremor was observed only in patients with PD-TDT. Surface EMG analyses of arm tremor demonstrated considerable overlaps in tremor type, tremor frequency, and contractive patterns. However, patients with PD-TDT were significantly more likely to exhibit resting tremor, and experienced alternative contraction patterns only for kinetic tremor, which was in contrast to patients with ET. For non-motor symptom analyses, patients with PD-TDT had more non-motor symptoms compared to patients with ET (mean=5.0 vs. 2.6; P=0.002). Specifically, patients with PD-TDT exhibited higher frequencies of hyposmia, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)-like symptom, urinary frequency, and memory disturbance. Age- and gender- matched analyses for the severity of NMSS scores did not indicate significant differences. However, patients with PD-TDT displayed slightly lower scores of frontal function test compared to patients with ET.\nCareful and detailed evaluations of both tremor features and non-motor symptoms are required in order to distinguish between ET and PD-TDT.",

    "abstract": "Persephin, together with glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and neurturin, has a neurotrophic effect and promotes the survival of motor neurons cultured in vitro. In this study, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of rats were transfected with the Persephin gene. One week later 6-hydroxydopamine was injected into the anterior medial bundle to establish a Parkinson's disease model in the rats. Results found that the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra increased, tyrosine hydroxylase expression was upregulated and concentrations of dopamine and its metabolites in corpus striatum were increased after pretreatment with Persephin gene. In addition, the rotating effect of the induced Parkinson's disease rats was much less in the group pretreated with the Persephin gene. Persephin has a neuroprotective effect on the 6-hydroxydopamine-induced Parkinson's disease through protecting dopaminergic neurons.",

Because ethnic-specific effect is an important concern for GWAS analysis, we genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the new genetic loci, GCH1 (rs11158026), SIPA1L2 (rs10797576), VPS13C (rs2414739), and MIR4697 (rs329648), to investigate their associations with risk of PD in Taiwan. Another single-nucleotide polymorphism GCH1 rs7155501, previously identified by GWAS listed at the top 20 genes in PDGene database was also included. A total of 1151 study subjects comprising 598 patients with PD and 553 unrelated healthy controls were recruited. The frequency of minor allele (C allele) of GCH1 rs11158026 was found to be significantly higher in PD cases than in controls (p\u00a0= 0.003). The CC genotype of rs11158026 increased PD risk compared to TT genotype (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0= 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0= 1.09, 1.53, p\u00a0= 0.004). Under additive model, the GCH1 rs11158026 increased the risk of developing PD (OR\u00a0= 1.30, 95% CI\u00a0= 1.10, 1.54, p\u00a0= 0.002). In recessive model, the genotype TT of MIR4697 rs329648 marginally decreased the PD risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.62, 95% CI\u00a0= 0.43, 0.90, p\u00a0= 0.01). The PD patients demonstrated similar genotypic and allelic frequencies in GCH1 rs7155501, SIPA1L2 rs10797576, and VPS13C rs2414739 with the controls. These findings suggest that the GCH1 and MIR4697 but not SIPA1L2 and VPS13C are genetic loci influencing risk of PD in Taiwan.",

    "abstract": "Action observation treatment has been proposed as therapeutic option in rehabilitation of patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) to improve freezing of gait episodes. The purpose of this prospective open-label feasibility study was to evaluate the impact of 8-week action observation training (video-therapy) for the treatment of postural instability and balance impairment in PD patients. Fifteen PD patients aged under 80 years with scores of 1 to 3 on the Hoehn and Yahr staging and without evidence of freezing of gait were recruited. They underwent 24 sessions of video-therapy training based on carefully watching video clips on motor tasks linked to balance, subsequently performing the same observed movements. No statistically significant differences were observed in the identified outcome measures with the Berg Balance Scale and the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale after two months of follow-up. In the present study, a short course of action observation treatment seems to be not effective in reducing balance impairments and postural instability in patients affected by mild to moderate PD. Further studies with larger samples, longer follow-up period, and standardized protocols of action observation treatment are needed to investigate the effects of this rehabilitation technique in the management of postural and balance disorders of PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is caused by the degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. A rare recessive form of the disease may be caused by a mutation in the PARK2 gene, whose product, Parkin, controls mitophagy and programmed cell death. The level of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors of the Bcl-2 family was determined in dopaminergic neurons derived from the induced pluripotent stem cells of a healthy donor and a Parkinson's disease patient bearing PARK2 mutations. Western blotting was used to study the ratios of Bax, Bak, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-W proteins. The pro-apoptotic Bak protein level in PARK2-neurons was shown to be two times lower than that in healthy cells. In contrast, the expression of the anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-XL, Bcl-W, and Bcl-2 was statistically significantly higher in the mutant cells compared to healthy dopaminergic neurons. These results indicate that PARK2 mutations are accompanied by an imbalance in programmed cell death systems in which non-apoptotic molecular mechanisms play the leading role.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of Streblus asper leaf extract (SA) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SK-N-SH cell culture and on motor functions and behaviors in MPTP-treated C57BL/6 mice. SK-N-SH cell viability after incubation with SA for 24\u2009h was measured by MTT assay. Intracellular ROS levels of SK-N-SH cells were quantified after pretreatment with SA (0, 200, 600, and 1000\u2009\u00b5g/mL) in the presence of H2O2 (300\u2009\u00b5M). Male C57BL/6 mice were force-fed with water or 200\u2009mg/kg/day SA for 32 days. Intraperitoneal injection of MPTP was used to induce Parkinson's disease-like symptoms. Catalepsy, beam balance ability, olfactory discrimination, social recognition, and spontaneous locomotor activity were assessed on days 19, 21, 23, 26, and 32, respectively. In cell culture, SA at 200, 600, and 1000\u2009\u00b5g/mL significantly decreased ROS levels in H2O2-treated SK-N-SH cells. MPTP-treated C57BL/6 mice showed a significant change in all parameters tested when compared to the control group. Pretreatment and concurrent treatment with 200\u2009mg/kg/day SA could antagonize the motor and cognitive function deficits induced by MPTP. The results show that SA possesses anti-Parkinson effects in MPTP-treated C57BL/6 mice and that reduction in ROS levels might be one of the mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with emotional abnormalities. Dopaminergic medications ameliorate Parkinsonian motor symptoms, but less is known regarding the impact of dopaminergic agents on affective processing, particularly in depressed PD (dPD) patients. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of dopaminergic pharmacotherapy on brain activation to emotional stimuli in depressed versus nondepressed Parkinson disease (ndPD) patients. Participants included 18 ndPD patients (11 men, 7 women) and 10 dPD patients (7 men, 3 women). Patients viewed photographs of emotional faces during functional MRI. Scans were performed while the patient was taking anti-Parkinson medication and the day after medication had been temporarily discontinued. Results indicate that dopaminergic medications have opposite effects in the prefrontal cortex depending upon depression status. DPD patients show greater deactivation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) on dopaminergic medications than off, while ndPD patients show greater deactivation in this region off drugs. The VMPFC is in the default-mode network (DMN). DMN activity is negatively correlated with activity in brain systems used for external visual attention. Thus dopaminergic medications may promote increased attention to external visual stimuli among dPD patients but impede normal suppression of DMN activity during external stimulation among ndPD patients.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are the two most common neurodegenerative disorders. They develop after a progressive death of many neurons in the brain. Although therapies are available to treat the signs and symptoms of both diseases, the progression of neuronal death remains relentless, and it has proved difficult to slow or stop. Hence, there is a need to develop neuroprotective or disease-modifying treatments that stabilize this degeneration. Red to infrared light therapy (\u03bb = 600-1070 nm), and in particular light in the near infrared (NIr) range, is emerging as a safe and effective therapy that is capable of arresting neuronal death. Previous studies have used NIr to treat tissue stressed by hypoxia, toxic insult, genetic mutation and mitochondrial dysfunction with much success. Here we propose NIr therapy as a neuroprotective or disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients.",

    "abstract": "In mid-2015, interim results of a randomised trial conducted in the routine care setting, involving 1620 patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease, showed that levodopa was slightly more effective in terms of mobility than dopamine agonists or MAO-B inhibitors, after a median follow-up of 3 years. Levodopa caused more dyskinesias but fewer neuropsychiatric adverse effects, sleep disorders and gastrointestinal disorders. In patients with recently diagnosed Parkinson's disease, the advantage of first-line dopamine agonist therapy is uncertain.",

    "abstract": "Background. Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share pathological features, including amyloid-beta pathology. Amyloid-beta peptide is generated by sequential proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and genetic variations in the processing pathway genes have been found to increase the risk of AD; however, the contribution in PD is unknown. Methods. The aim of this study was to investigate whether candidate polymorphisms in five genes (ADAM10, BACE1, BACE2, PSEN2, and CLU) involved in the APP processing pathway affect PD risk in a population-based cohort of patients with incident PD and control subjects from the Norwegian ParkWest study. Results. We found an association of rs638405 in BACE1 with increased risk of PD, thus providing a novel link, at the genetic level, between amyloid-beta pathology and PD.",

    "abstract": "Organic psychosis effects up to 70\u00a0% of patients with PD at some point yet no widely accepted scale for this entity exists.\nWe developed a 10 question PD specific psychosis severity scale that we feel has good content validity. It asks about the presence, severity, frequency, and consequences of the hallucinations (visual, auditory, olfactory) and delusions.\nFifty different PD patients with psychosis and 25 PD patients without psychosis were included, and serial information was available in 21 of those encounters with psychosis.

    "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are among the most common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), greatly interfering with daily activities and diminishing life quality. Pharmacological treatments have not been satisfactory because of side effects and interactions with anti-parkinsonian drugs. While studies have shown that regular exercise improves sleep quality in normal aging, there is no definitive evidence in PD.\nIn a retrospective study, we determined whether an intense physical and multidisciplinary exercise program improves sleep quality in a large group of patients with PD. We analyzed the scores of PD Sleep Scale (PDSS), which was administered twice, 28\u00a0days apart, to two groups of patients with PD of comparable age, gender, disease duration and pharmacological treatment. The control group (49 patients) did not receive rehabilitation, The treated group (89 patients) underwent a 28-day multidisciplinary intensive rehabilitation program (three one-hour daily sessions comprising cardiovascular warm-up, relaxation, muscle-stretching, balance and gait training, occupational therapy to improve daily living activities).\nAt enrolment, control and treated groups had similar UPDRS and PDSS scores. At re-test, 28\u00a0days later, UPDRS and total PDSS scores improved in the treated (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) but not in the control group. In particular, the treated group showed significant improvement in PDSS scores for sleep quality, motor symptoms and daytime somnolence. The control group did not show improvement for any item.\nThese results suggest that multidisciplinary intensive rehabilitation treatment may have a positive impact on many aspects of sleep in PD.",

    "abstract": "Arrhythmokinesis, the variability in repetitive movements, is a fundamental feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). We hypothesized that unimanual repetitive alternating finger tapping (AFT) would reveal more arrhythmokinesis compared to bimanual single finger alternating hand tapping (SFT), in PD.\nThe variability of inter-strike interval (CVISI) and of amplitude (CVAMP) during AFT and SFT were measured on an engineered, MRI-compatible keyboard in sixteen PD subjects off medication and in twenty-four age-matched controls.\nThe CVISI and CVAMP of the more affected (MA) and less affected (LA) sides in PD subjects were greater during AFT than SFT (P\u2009<\u20090.05). However, there was no difference between AFT and SFT for controls. Both CVISI and CVAMP were greater in the MA and LA hands of PD subjects versus controls during AFT (P\u2009<\u20090.01). The CVISI and CVAMP of the MA, but not the LA hand, were greater in PDs versus controls during SFT (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Also, AFT, but not SFT, detected a difference between the MA and LA hands of PDs (P\u2009<\u20090.01).\nUnimanual, repetitive alternating finger tapping brings out more arrhythmokinesis compared to bimanual, single finger tapping in PDs but not in controls. Arrhythmokinesis during unimanual, alternating finger tapping captured a significant difference between both the MA and LA hands of PD subjects and controls, whereas that during a bimanual, single finger tapping task only distinguished between the MA hand and controls. Arrhythmokinesis underlies freezing of gait and may also underlie the freezing behavior documented in fine motor control if studied using a unimanual alternating finger tapping task.",

    "abstract": "Differentiating movement disorders is critical for appropriate treatment, prognosis, and for clinical trials. In clinical trials this is especially important as effects can be diluted by inclusion of inappropriately diagnosed participants. In early disease duration phases, disorders often have overlapping clinical features, such as impairments in repetitive finger movement, making diagnosis challenging. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine and compare repetitive finger movement performance in participants diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, and spinocerebellar ataxias.\nParticipants completed an unconstrained index finger flexion/extension movement (i.e. finger tap) in time with an incremental acoustic tone. Measures of movement rate, movement amplitude, and coefficient of variation were compared among groups.\nSignificant differences between groups were revealed for movement rate at faster tone rates. Participants with Parkinson's disease tended to tap faster than the tone rate while participants with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and spinocerebellar ataxia tended to tap slower. No significant differences were revealed for movement amplitude, but participants with spinocerebellar ataxia demonstrated greater variance in amplitude than participants with Parkinson's disease.\nQuantitative analysis of repetitive finger movement performance at faster rates may be helpful to differentiate Parkinson's Disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and spinocerebellar ataxia.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative syndrome of the basal ganglia (BG) believed to disrupt cortical-subcortical pathways critical to motor, cognitive and expressive language function. Recent studies have shown subtle deficits in expressive language performance among individuals with PD even in the earliest stage of the disease. The objective of this study was to use measures of lexical diversity to examine expressive language performance during discourse production in a sample of individuals with PD.\nTwelve individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) were compared to twelve matched, neurologically intact controls on measures of lexical diversity. Three minute discourse samples describing a typical day were collected and analyzed for lexical diversity with the CHILDES program using measures of type token ratio (TTR) and voc-D (D).\nComparisons of three minute discourse samples indicated non-significant differences between individuals with PD and controls in word productivity (387 vs 356; p\u2009=\u2009.48). Similarly, there were also non-significant differences on measures of lexical diversity between the two groups (TTR\u2009=\u2009.45 vs.44; p\u2009=\u2009.50 and D 74 vs 68; p\u2009=\u2009.23).\nThese results suggest that lexical diversity during discourse production among individuals with PD is similar to non-neurological controls. These findings indicate that lexical diversity is an aspect of expressive language performance that is not impacted by the disease process in the earliest stages.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic systems in the central nervous system. In migraine it is supposed to occur hyperactivation of central dopaminergic pathways. We verified the hypothesis of improved migraine in patients who manifest PD. We evaluated 109 patients with PD over 40 years (57 men and 52 women) about the presence throughout the life of migraine, as well as the possibility of improvement in migraine after the onset of motor symptoms of PD. This group was compared to a control group of 152 people (41 men and 152 women) without PD regarding the presence of migraine and its improvement. Twenty-one patients manifested migraine in the group with PD (16 women and 5 men) in which 13 reported improvement in migraine after the onset of symptoms of PD. Among the controls, 37 interviewed had migraine history (32 women and 5 men) among which 20 showed improvement. There was no significant difference when comparing the two groups (\u03c7(2) 1:0,05=0.337; P<0.382). We were unable to relate the improvement of migraine with the emergence of PD motor signs, despite the degeneration of dopaminergic pathways of the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) has traditionally been performed in awake patients. Some patients are unable to tolerate awake surgery or extensive time off their medication to allow for neurophysiological testing during traditional DBS implantation, which has previously limited surgical options for these patients. Recently, asleep image-guided lead placement using intraoperative MRI or CT for verification has been proposed as an alternative for patients unable or unwilling to undergo awake DBS surgery.\nWe conducted a retrospective chart review comparing PD patients who underwent asleep MRI-guided subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS lead placement (n = 14) and awake neurophysiologically guided STN DBS lead placement (n = 23) at our institution. Both groups' levodopa equivalent daily doses (LEDDs) and complications at approximately 6 months of follow-up were compared, along with operative times.\nBoth groups showed statistically similar reductions in LEDD at 6 months of therapy (38.27% for awake, 49.27% for asleep; p = 0.4447), and similar complications. Operative times were initially longer for MRI-guided DBS but improved with surgical experience.\nAsleep MRI-guided DBS is a viable option for PD patients unable or unwilling to undergo awake placement, with similar results in terms of LEDD reduction and complications.",

    "abstract": "The nigral lesion and the resulting contralateral motor signs of Parkinson's disease (PD) are remarkably asymmetric. This study investigated the prevalence of patients with \"wrong-sided\" lesions, that is, patients with symptoms on the side ipsilateral to the predominant dopaminergic nigrostriatal deficit.\nThe analyzed sample included 434 early unmedicated PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database. Asymmetry indices of motor function and putamen [(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT were calculated from the screening visit data.\nIpsilateral deficits were unexpectedly common even when only patients with clear motor and dopaminergic asymmetries were included in the analysis (8.1%, n = 24/295). When patients with any asymmetry were included in the analysis, the prevalence of ipsilateral deficits was 15.4% (n = 65/423). Wrong-sided symptoms were not associated with the PD motor subtype. However, the dataset was heavily biased toward tremor-dominant patients (85% of patients). Right-handed PD patients had predominantly right-sided motor symptoms and left-sided dopamine defects, whereas the effect was opposite in left-handed patients (P = 0.005 and 0.028, respectively).\nThe results indicate that the side of the predominant motor symptoms and the corresponding side of the dopaminergic defects in PD are not random, but are directed by brain lateralization. Importantly, the traditional pathogenetic model of nigral degeneration causing primarily contralateral motor symptoms may be inadequate in many patients.",

The accuracy of the predicted scores was assessed using regression modeling, classical intraclass correlation coefficients, and the Bland-Altman method.\nThere was strong correlation between the two scores. Adding 7 points to a UPDRS III total score performed approximately as well as previously published conversion formulas (intraclass correlation: 0.96). The adjusted score is expected to be within 3 points of the MDS-UPDRS III score 50% of the time and within 9 points 95% of the time.\nSimply adding 7 points to a UPDRS III total score provides a good approximation of the MDS-UPDRS III total score.",

    "abstract": "Presenilin-associated rhomboid-like (PARL), a serine protease located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, has been shown to genetically interact and process PTEN-induced putative kinase a protein known for its critical role in mitochondrial homeostasis and early-onset forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). The identification of a PD-associated variant in the PARL gene (p.Ser77Asn) led us to assess the relevance of PARL for PD pathogenesis using a mutation screening of the coding sequences and adjacent intronic sequences. We investigated 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs3792589, rs13091, and rs3732581), a synonymous base substitution (Leu79Leu) and the previously described p.Ser77Asn mutation, which were subsequently screened in more than 2000 patients and controls. Not detecting the p.Ser77Asn mutation in our cohort, nor a robust association between variations in the PARL gene and PD, the role of disease causing genetic variants in the PARL gene could not be further substantiated in our samples. Our findings indicate that PARL mutations are a rare cause of PD and genetic variants are neither strong nor common risk factors in PD.",

    "abstract": "Although white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and olfactory dysfunction are independently associated with the cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD), the effects of simultaneous presence of these abnormalities remain unknown. Thus, we investigated the different effects of deep WMH and periventricular WMH on olfactory and cognitive performance and evaluated the additive effects of the concurrent presence of WMH and olfactory dysfunction on cognitive performance in PD.\nWe enrolled 171 patients with non-demented PD whose WMH scores were assessed using a semi-quantitative visual rating system. The olfactory and cognitive performance was assessed using the Cross-Cultural Smell Identification (CCSI) test and the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery. Additionally, the additive effects of concurrent WMH and olfactory dysfunction on cognitive performance were investigated using binary logistic regression.\nThe deep WMH score exhibited a significant negative correlation with the CCSI score (p = 0.026) but the total WMH and periventricular WMH did not. A multiple regression analysis revealed that the total WMH (\u03b2 = -0.109, p = 0.011) and deep WMH (\u03b2 = -0.153, p = 0.020) severities had significant negative correlations with semantic fluency. A logistic regression analysis revealed that the simultaneous presence of severe olfactory dysfunction and deep WMH was associated with a greater risk for the semantic fluency impairments (odds ratio = 15.909, p = 0.0005) compared to patients with mild deep WMH or high CCSI scores.\nThese data indicate that deep WMH was closely coupled with olfactory impairments and cognitive decline in PD. Moreover, the concurrent presence of severe deep WMH and olfactory impairments has a greater influence on semantic fluency.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may develop several gait disturbances during the course of illness and Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of them. Several neuroimaging studies have been conducted to identify the neural correlates of FOG but results have not been uniform. Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is relatively less explored in PD patients with FOG. This study aims to compare the whole brain resting state connectivity of PD patients with and without FOG using rs-fMRI.\nrs-fMRI was obtained for 28 PD patients (15 with and 13 patients without FOG) who were matched for various demographic and clinical characteristics. Seed to voxel analysis was performed at whole brain level and compared between the two groups.\nWhen compared to patients without FOG, the patients with FOG had reduced functional connectivity across multiple seeds. Major finding was reduced inter-hemispheric connectivity of left parietal opercular cortex with multiple regions of the brain primarily involving the primary somatosensory and auditory areas, which also negatively correlated with the FOGQ scores.\nOur findings suggest that alterations in the resting state functional connectivity of the opercular parietal cortex may be one of the substrates of FOG. Reduced interhemispheric connectivity probably is the reason for impairment of control and coordination in bilateral leg movements while walking.",

    "abstract": "The influence of approaching death in addition to age and their interaction on the course of a broad spectrum of nondopaminergic features in Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been well studied. This study addresses this issue in a prospectively designed study.\nDuring five years, the severity of axial symptoms, cognitive impairment, psychotic symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, depressive symptoms, and daytime sleepiness was annually evaluated in PD patients. For each domain a linear mixed-effect model was used to examine changes during follow-up and relations with age and death.\nOf 378 included patients, 43 died during follow-up. Higher age was associated with increased severity of all nondopaminergic features except depression, and with a higher rate of progression of axial symptoms and cognitive impairment. Patients who died during follow-up had a higher severity of all nondopaminergic features except autonomic dysfunction, and a higher rate of progression of axial symptoms, cognitive impairment, and psychotic symptoms, compared to patients who survived.\nThis study shows that the severity of most nondopaminergic features and the progression rate of axial and psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment increase before PD patients die, independent of the influence of age. An interaction between age and approaching death did not have a significant effect on the course of the symptoms. Improving our understanding of the fundamental biology underlying these factors and the interaction with factors intrinsic to the disease, may have profound implications for the treatment of PD.",

    "conclusions": "This study shows that the severity of most nondopaminergic features and the progression rate of axial and psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment increase before PD patients die, independent of the influence of age. An interaction between age and approaching death did not have a significant effect on the course of the symptoms. Improving our understanding of the fundamental biology underlying these factors and the interaction with factors intrinsic to the disease, may have profound implications for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Background. The electronic medical records provide new and unprecedented opportunities for large population-based and clinical studies if valid and reliable diagnoses can be obtained, to determine what information is needed to distinguish idiopathic PD from Parkinsonism in electronic medical records. Methods. Chart review of complete medical records of 2,446 patients with a hospital discharge diagnosis of PD, who, between 1996 and 2009, were registered in the Danish National Hospital Register as idiopathic PD. All patients were examined in neurology departments. Clinical features were abstracted from charts to determine Parkinsonian phenotypes and disease course, using predefined criteria for idiopathic PD. Results. Chart review verified that 2,068 (84.5%) patients met criteria for idiopathic PD. The most distinguishing features of idiopathic PD patients were asymmetric onset, and fewer atypical features at onset or follow-up compared to Parkinsonism, and the area under the curve (AUC) for these items alone is moderate (0.74-0.77) and the highest AUC (0.91) was achieved when using all clinical features recorded in addition to PD medication use and a follow-up of 5 years or more. Conclusion. To reduce disease misclassification, information extracted from medical record review with at least 5 years of follow-up after first diagnosis was key to improve diagnostic accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Background. To diagnose Parkinson disease (PD) in an early stage and accurately evaluate severity, it is important to develop a sensitive method for detecting structural changes in the substantia nigra (SN). Method. Seventy-two untreated patients with early PD and 72 healthy controls underwent diffusion tensor and diffusion kurtosis imaging. Regions of interest were drawn in the rostral, middle, and caudal SN by two blinded and independent raters. Mean kurtosis (MK) and fractional anisotropy in the SN were compared between the groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Spearman correlation analyses were used to compare the diagnostic accuracy and correlate imaging findings with Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) staging and part III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III). Result. MK in the SN was increased significantly in PD patients compared with healthy controls. The area under the ROC curve was 0.976 for MK in the SN (sensitivity, 0.944; specificity, 0.917). MK in the SN had a positive correlation with H-Y staging and UPDRS-III scores. Conclusion. Diffusion kurtosis imaging is a sensitive method for PD diagnosis and severity evaluation. MK in the SN is a potential biomarker for imaging studies of early PD that can be widely used in clinic.",

The aim of this study was to identify systemic alterations in lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2a, heatshock cognate-70, and glucocerebrosidase levels/activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PD patients.\nProtein/mRNA levels were assessed in PD patients from genetically undetermined background, alpha-synuclein (G209A/A53T), or glucocerebrosidase mutation carriers and age-/sex-matched controls.\nHeatshock cognate 70 protein levels were reduced in all PD groups, whereas its mRNA levels were decreased only in the genetically undetermined group. Glucocerebrosidase protein levels were decreased only in the genetic PD groups, whereas increased mRNA levels and decreased activity were detected only in the glucocerebrosidase mutation group.\nReduced heatshock cognate-70 levels are suggestive of an apparent systemic chaperone-mediated autophagy dysfunction irrespective of genetic background. Glucocerebrosidase activity may serve as a screening tool to identify glucocerebrosidase mutation carriers with PD.",

    "abstract": "Although a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarker for Parkinson's disease (PD) remains an unfulfilled objective, there have been numerous developments in MRI methodology and some of these have shown promise for PD. With funding from the National Institutes of Health and the Michael J Fox Foundation there will be further validation of structural, diffusion-based, and iron-focused MRI methods as possible biomarkers for PD. In this review, these methods and other strategies such as neurochemical and metabolic MRI have been covered. One of the challenges in establishing a biomarker is in the selection of individuals as PD is a heterogeneous disease with varying clinical features, different etiologies, and a range of pathologic changes. Additionally, longitudinal studies are needed of individuals with clinically diagnosed PD and cohorts of individuals who are at great risk for developing PD to validate methods. Ultimately an MRI biomarker will be useful in the diagnosis of PD, predicting the course of PD, providing a means to track its course, and provide an approach to select and monitor treatments.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between freezing of gait (FOG) and postural instability in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unclear. We analyzed the impact of FOG on postural control.\n31 PD patients with FOG (PD+FOG), 27 PD patients without FOG (PD-FOG) and 22 healthy control (HC) were assessed in the ON state. Postural control was measured with the Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) scale and with center of pressure (COP) analysis during quiet stance and maximal voluntary forward/backward leaning.\nThe groups were balanced concerning age, disease duration and disease severity. PD+FOG performed significantly worse in the FAB scale (21.8 \u00b1 5.8) compared to PD-FOG (25.6 \u00b1 5.0) and HC (34.9 \u00b1 2.4) (mean \u00b1 SD, p < 0.01). PD+FOG had impaired ability to voluntary lean forward, difficulties to stand on foam with eyes closed and reduced limits of stability compared to PD-FOG (p < 0.05). During quiet stance the average anterior-posterior COP position was significantly displaced towards posterior in PD+FOG in comparison to PD-FOG and HC (p < 0.05). The COP position correlated with severity of FOG (p < 0.01). PD+FOG and PD-FOG did not differ in average COP sway excursion, sway velocity, sway regularity and postural control asymmetry.\nPD+FOG have reduced postural control compared to PD-FOG and HC. Our results show a relationship between the anterior-posterior COP position during quiet stance and FOG. The COP shift towards posterior in PD+FOG leads to a restricted precondition to generate forward progression during gait initiation. This may contribute to the occurrence of FOG or might be a compensatory strategy to avoid forward falls.",

    "abstract": "The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small-bodied, popular New World monkey and is used widely in reproductive biology, neuroscience, and drug development, due to its comparative ease of handling, high reproductive efficiency, and its unique behavioral characters. In this review, we discuss the marmoset models in Parkinson's disease (PD), which is a neurological movement disorder primarily resulting from a degeneration of dopaminergic neurons with clinical features of tremor, rigidity, postural instability, and akinesia. The most common PD models involve the administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or 6-hydroxydopamine to study the pathogenesis and to evaluate novel therapies. Following the systemic or local administration of these neurotoxins, the marmosets with very severe Parkinson's symptoms are recommended to be placed in an intensive care unit with artificial feeding to increase survival rate. All procedures with MPTP should be conducted in a special room with enclosed cages under negative-pressure by trained researchers with personal protection. Behavioral tests are conducted to provide an external measure of the brain pathology. Along with several biomarkers, including \u03b1-synuclein and DJ-1, non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are used to evaluate the functional changes associated with PD. With the recent growing interest in potential and novel therapies such as stem cell and gene therapy for PD in Korea, the marmoset can be considered as a suitable non-human primate model in PD research to bridge the gap between rodent studies and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder which has a significant social and economic impact. PD is diagnosed by clinical observation and evaluations, coupled with a PD rating scale. However, these methods may be insufficient, especially in the initial phase of the disease. The processes are tedious and time-consuming, and hence systems that can automatically offer a diagnosis are needed. In this study, a novel method for the diagnosis of PD is proposed. Biomedical sound measurements obtained from continuous phonation samples were used as attributes. First, a minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) attribute selection algorithm was applied for the identification of the effective attributes. After conversion to a complex number, the resulting attributes are presented as input data to the complex-valued artificial neural network (CVANN). The proposed novel system might be a powerful tool for effective diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily due to the progressive, selective and irreversible loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Interestingly, DA neurons in the ventral and lateral SN are much more susceptible than adjacent dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) not only in human PD but in many PD model systems. However, the molecular causes of regional vulnerability in PD remain unknown. In our previous studies, we established acute PD animal models by administration of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine), and found that AQP4 knockout mice were significantly more prone to MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. Here, we further observe that AQP4 deficiency resulted in the same susceptible to MPTP between SN DA neuron and VTA neurons both in acute and chronic PD model. Moreover, we show that AQP4 deficiency increased the numbers of reactive astrocytes and microglias not only in the SN and but also in the VTA under basal and MPTP-induced situations. Meanwhile, AQP4 deficiency disrupted the balance of the pro-inflammatory cytokine/neurotrophin in midbrain. Taken together, these results demonstrate that glial AQP4 is involved in the susceptibility differences of DA neurons between SN and VTA, although the precise mechanism of AQP4 remains to be explored. Moreover, these findings also suggest that these susceptibility differences are not only due to intrinsic neuronal factors, but also attribute to differences in astrocytes of these regions.",

    "abstract": "Chronic and slow progression of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease is responsible for an altered neurotransmission of various biogenic amines, such as dopamine. Therefore, an individually different pronounced heterogeneity of motor and nonmotor symptoms characterizes each Parkinson's disease patient. Ideal candidates for the balance of these neurotransmitter deficits are compounds like safinamide with broad mechanisms of action such as reversible monoamine oxidase type B inhibition, blockage of voltage-dependent sodium channels, modulation of calcium channels and of glutamate release. Safinamide is administered one time daily with oral doses ranging from 50 to 100 mg. Safinamide was well tolerated and safe, ameliorated motor symptoms when combined with dopamine agonist only or additional levodopa in clinical trials. Safinamide is a novel instrument for the drug therapy of Parkinson's disease with better safety and tolerability particularly concerning diarrhea than inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase, like entacapone, according to an indirect comparison within a meta-analysis with entacapone.",

    "abstract": "GBA mutations are to date the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease. The GBA gene encodes the lysomal hydrolase glucocerebrosidase. Whilst bi-allelic GBA mutations cause Gaucher disease, both mono- and bi-allelic mutations confer risk for Parkinson's disease. Clinically, Parkinson's disease patients with GBA mutations resemble idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients. However, these patients have a modest reduction in age-of-onset of disease and a greater incidence of cognitive decline. In some cases, GBA mutations are also responsible for familial Parkinson's disease. The accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein into Lewy bodies is the central neuropathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Pathologic GBA mutations reduce enzymatic function. A reduction in glucocerebrosidase function increases \u03b1-synuclein levels and propagation, which in turn inhibits glucocerebrosidase in a feed-forward cascade. This cascade is central to the neuropathology of GBA-associated Parkinson's disease. The lysosomal integral membrane protein type-2 is necessary for normal glucocerebrosidase function. Glucocerebrosidase dysfunction also increases in the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid and amyloid-precursor protein, oxidative stress, neuronal susceptibility to metal ions, microglial and immune activation. These factors contribute to neuronal death. The Mendelian Parkinson's disease genes, Parkin and ATP13A2, intersect with glucocerebrosidase. These factors sketch a complex circuit of GBA-associated neuropathology. To clinically interfere with this circuit, central glucocerebrosidase function must be improved. Strategies based on reducing breakdown of mutant glucocerebrosidase and increasing the fraction that reaches the lysosome has shown promise. Breakdown can be reduced by interfering with the ability of heat-shock proteins to recognize mutant glucocerebrosidase. This underlies the therapeutic efficacy of certain pharmacological chaperones and histone deacetylase inhibitors. These therapies are promising for Parkinson's disease, regardless of mutation status. Recently, there has been a boom in studies investigating the role of glucocerebrosidase in the pathology of Parkinson's disease. This merits a comprehensive review of the current cell biological processes and pathological pictures involving Parkinson's disease associated with GBA mutations.",

    "abstract": "The underlying pathology of brain leading to cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains poorly understood. The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD may be related to atrophy of special gray matter regions.\nHigh-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of the brains and comprehensive cognitive function tests were acquired in 37 PD patients and 21 healthy controls (HC) from September 2013 to October 2014. Patients were divided into two groups: PD with MCI (PD-MCI, n=18) and PD with normal cognition (PDNC, n=19). Gray matter density differences were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). VBM and cognitive results, UPDRS scores and Hoehn-Yahr stages were compared between PD-MCI, PDCN and HC group, and correlation analyses were performed between those brain areas and cognition scores, UPDRS scores and disease duration, which showed significant group differences.\nThe demographic data and motor severity among three groups were similar. However, comprehensive cognitive function results were more severe in PD-MCI than the other two groups. Compared to the HC group, the PDNC group showed reductions in gray matter density in frontal, temporal, parietal, bilateral insula lobes and many other regions of brain. Besides above changes, the PD-MCI group also revealed gray matter concentration decrease in left hippocampus and thalamus, and these changes still remained when compared with the PDNC group. The HC group did not show any more areas of atrophy in gray matter than others. Gray matter loss in PD represented significant correlations with global cognitive scores, motor severity or disease duration in some of these atrophic regions.\nThe initial stages of cognitive function decline in patients with PD is closely associated with gray matter atrophy in left hippocampus and thalamus. These two regions may serve as potential imaging biomarkers for PD-MCI.",

Besides above changes, the PD-MCI group also revealed gray matter concentration decrease in left hippocampus and thalamus, and these changes still remained when compared with the PDNC group. The HC group did not show any more areas of atrophy in gray matter than others. Gray matter loss in PD represented significant correlations with global cognitive scores, motor severity or disease duration in some of these atrophic regions.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture has been commonly used as an adjuvant therapy or monotherapy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease in China and in other countries. Animal studies have consistently show that this treatment is both neuroprotective, protecting dopaminergic neurons from degeneration and also restorative, restoring tyrosine hydroxylase positive dopaminergic terminals in striatum, resulting in improvements in motor performance in animal models of Parkinsonism. Studies show that this protection is mediated through the same common mechanisms as other neuroprotective agents, including anti-oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic pathways at molecular and cellular levels. Restoration of function seems to involve activation of certain compensatory brain regions as a mechanism at the network level to correct the imbalances to the nervous system resulting from loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra. Clinical studies in China and Korea, in particular, have shown a positive benefit of acupuncture in treating Parkinson's disease, especially in reducing the doses of dopaminergic medications and the associated side effects. However, large and well-controlled clinical trials are still needed to further demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of disease severity and medication state on postural control asymmetry during challenging tasks in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Nineteen people with PD and 11 neurologically healthy individuals performed three standing task conditions: bipedal standing, tandem and unipedal adapted standing; the individuals with PD performed the tasks in ON and OFF medication state. The participants with PD were distributed into 2 groups according to disease severity: unilateral group (n=8) and bilateral group (n=11). The two PD groups performed the evaluations both under and without the medication. Two force plates were used to analyze the posture. The symmetric index was calculated for various of center of pressure. ANOVA one-way (groups) and two-way (PD groups\u00d7medication), with repeated measures for medication, were calculated. For main effects of group, the bilateral group was more asymmetric than CG. For main effects of medication, only unipedal adapted standing presented effects of PD medication. There was PD groups\u00d7medication interaction. Under the effects of medication, the unilateral group presented lower asymmetry of RMS in anterior-posterior direction and area than the bilateral group in unipedal adapted standing. In addition, the unilateral group presented lower asymmetry of mean velocity, RMS in anterior-posterior direction and area in unipedal standing and area in tandem adapted standing after a medication dose. Postural control asymmetry during challenging postural tasks was dependent on disease severity and medication state in people with PD. The bilateral group presented higher postural control asymmetry than the control and unilateral groups in challenging postural tasks. Finally, the medication dose was able to reduce postural control asymmetry in the unilateral group during challenging postural tasks.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a major neurodegenerative disorder which primarily involves the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and related projections in the striatum. The pesticide/neurotoxin, rotenone, has been shown to cause systemic inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity in nigral dopaminergic neurons, with consequent degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway, as observed in Parkinson's disease. A novel intrastriatal rotenone model of Parkinson's disease was used to examine the neuroprotective effects of chronic low-dose treatment with the antioxidant indoleamine, melatonin, which can upregulate neurotrophic factors and other protective proteins in the brain. Sham or lesioned rats were treated with either vehicle (0.04% ethanol in drinking water) or melatonin at a dose of 4 \u00b5g/mL in drinking water. The right striatum was lesioned by stereotactic injection of rotenone at three sites (4 \u03bcg/site) along its rostrocaudal axis. Apomorphine administration to lesioned animals resulted in a significant (p<0.001) increase in ipsilateral rotations, which was suppressed by melatonin. Nine weeks post-surgery, animals were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion. Subsequent immunohistochemical examination revealed a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity within the striatum and substantia nigra of rotenone-lesioned animals. Melatonin treatment attenuated the decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase in the striatum and abolished it in the substantia nigra. Stereological cell counts indicated a significant (p<0.05) decrease in dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra of rotenone-lesioned animals, which was confirmed by Nissl staining. Importantly, chronic melatonin treatment blocked the loss of dopamine neurons in rotenone-lesioned animals. These findings strongly support the therapeutic potential of long-term and low-dose melatonin treatment in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Animal and cell experiments showed that inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) was protective on neurons in parkinson's disease (PD) model, but the underlying mechanism of this action was not extensively elucidated. To address this question, we established 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced human dopaminergic cell line SH-SY5Y as PD cell model and testified the neuroprotection of IP6. Through hoechst nuclear stain method and flow cytometric analysis, apoptosis induced by 6-OHDA was blocked by IP6 pretreatment. Significant protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) was observed in 6-OHDA induced cells pretreated with IP6. To further investigate the mechanism of anti-apoptotic effect of IP6, expression of mediators in mitochondrion dependent apoptotic pathway was detected. Results indicated that loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c releasing, upregulation of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), downregulation of B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and caspases activation were reversed by IP6. In addition, using flow cytometric method and western blot approach, our data showed that IP6 attenuated the rise of calcium and \u03b1-synuclein aggregation in cytosol. Collectively, IP6 exerted its neuroprotection on dopaminergic cells in PD cell model and the mechanism may be associated with changes of mitochondrion mediated apoptotic pathway and \u03b1-synuclein aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Depression is considered a syndrome with a constellation of symptoms that are frequently categorized into 3 domains including affective, somatic and cognitive. There has been limited research into the domain specific magnitude or relative timing of treatment response in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, antidepressant trials involving patients with PD have demonstrated a similar robust placebo response to that seen in other populations. However, the timing of the placebo response has not been carefully studied.\nWe studied differential responses to antidepressant treatment in affective, somatic and cognitive domains of depression. Patients were treated for twelve weeks with placebo, venlafaxine or paroxetine as part of the Study of Antidepressants in Parkinson's Disease (SAD-PD) randomized controlled trial. Depressive symptoms were evaluated with three commonly used rating scales.\nAll symptom domains improved during the study period, There was a significant placebo effect, especially in the first two weeks that had diminished by week 12. Compared to placebo, the affective symptoms significantly improved during treatment as early as week 4, followed by the somatic symptoms of depression in week 6 and cognitive symptoms in week 8. The largest response was seen in the affective domain.\nIn depressed PD patients treated with venlafaxine or paroxetine, affective symptoms improved first, followed by somatic symptoms and cognitive symptoms. These findings could guide patient counselling and increase patient compliance by informing about the expected treatment responses. The substantial placebo effect underlines the importance of a sufficiently long study period in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder with complex pathogenesis implicating both environmental and genetic factors. We aimed to summarise the environmental risk factors that have been studied for potential association with Parkinson's disease, assess the presence of diverse biases, and identify the risk factors with the strongest support.\nWe searched PubMed from inception to September 18, 2015, to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations between environmental factors and Parkinson's disease. For each meta-analysis we estimated the summary effect size by random-effects and fixed-effects models, the 95% confidence interval and the 95% prediction interval. We estimated the between-study heterogeneity expressed by I(2), evidence of small-study effects and evidence of excess significance bias.\nOverall, 75 unique meta-analyses on different risk factors for Parkinson's disease were examined, covering diverse biomarkers, dietary factors, drugs, medical history or comorbid diseases, exposure to toxic environmental agents and habits. 21 of 75 meta-analyses had results that were significant at p < 0.001 by random-effects. Evidence for an association was convincing (more than 1000 cases, p < 10(-6) by random-effects, not large heterogeneity, 95% prediction interval excluding the null value and absence of hints for small-study effects and excess significance bias) for constipation, and physical activity.\nMany environmental factors have substantial evidence of association with Parkinson's disease, but several, perhaps most, of them may reflect reverse causation, residual confounding, information bias, sponsor conflicts or other caveats.",

    "abstract": "Dementia is common in Parkinson disease (PD). Since magnetic resonance imaging has been used, hippocampal atrophy has been shown in PD patients with or without dementia. In this study we sought the correlation of cognitive decline with bilateral hippocampal volume in PD patients.\nThirty-three patients with diagnosis of idiopathic PD and 16 healthy subjects were included in this study. PD patients were divided into two groups as normal cognitive function and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The Mini-Mental State Examination and detailed cognitive assessment tests were performed for all patients for cognitive analyses. Depression was excluded by the Geriatric Depression Scale.\nThe mean onset age of disease was 55 years for PD patients without dementia and 59 for PD patients with MCI. According to the Hoehn-Yahr scales, 24% of patients had grade 1, 58% had grade 2, and 18% had grade 3 disease. Right and left hippocampal volumes decreased along with cognitive test scores in PD patients. Increased right hippocampal volume was correlated with forward number test in the MCI-PD group.\nThese findings suggest that memory deficit is associated with hippocampal atrophy in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by alterations in the gait pattern that may increase the risk of falls. Variations in the gait pattern cannot be objectively measured in clinical examination, so it is necessary to adapt devices to measure objectively, valid and replicable changes in gait patterns that are part of the evolution of the disease and / or pharmacotherapy. In an interdisciplinary effort, we developed the \"e-Motion Capture System\" software, which is able to calculate motor (cadence, stride and step length) and spatiotemporal (velocity and acceleration) parameters that affect quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease. In this paper, we show results of the comparison between our e-Motion software and a benchmark reference, multiple-camera 3D motion capture system to track a gait pattern. This analysis was performed to compare the spatial locations of the ankles of a volunteer under indoor controlled conditions. Our results for the comparison between e-Motion and the 3D motion capture system show excellent agreement.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait is a very debilitating symptom affecting many patients with Parkinson's disease, leading to a reduced mobility and increased risk for falls. Turning is known to be the most provocative trigger for freezing of gait. However, the underlying brain dynamic changes associated with a turning freeze remain unknown. This study therefore used ambulatory EEG to investigate the brain dynamic changes associated with freezing of gait during turning. In addition, this study aimed to determine the most suitable EEG sensor location to detect freezing of gait during turning using our classification system. Data from four Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait was analysed using power spectral density and brain effective connectivity, comparing periods of successful turning with freezing of gait during turning. Results showed that freezing of gait during turning is associated with significant alterations in the high beta and theta power spectral densities across the occipital and parietal areas. Furthermore, brain effective connectivity showed that freezing during turning was associated with increased connectivity towards the visual area, which also had the highest accuracy to detect freezing episodes in the O1 regions by using power spectral density in our classification analyses. This is the first study to show cortical dynamic changes associated with freezing of gait during turning, providing valuable information to enhance the performance of future freezing of gait detection systems.",

Whereas it reduces the motor symptoms efficiently, its effect on autonomous nervous system is not clear. The information about effect of levodopa on heart rate variability is not coherent between the studies. In this study, ECG of 11 patients with Parkinson's disease was measured during levodopa challenge with pronounced dose of fast release levodopa to ensure the positive drug effect for deep brain stimulation treatment. Heart rate variability analysis was done at three time points, before administration of levodopa, 30 and 60 minutes after administration. After 30 minutes of administration, the HRV parameters show that parasympathetic nervous system activity is decreased and the sympatho-vagal balance is shifted towards sympathetic control. At 60 minutes after administration the parasympathetic nervous system activates slightly and causes a decrease in heart rate.",

The differential diagnosis of PD and ET tremor is important since the treatment depends on specific medication. A novel feature was developed based on a hypothesis stating that the tremor of PD subject has a larger fluctuation while performing resting task than action task. Tremor signal was collected using a gyroscope sensor attached to subject's finger. The angular velocity signal was analyzed by transforming a one-dimensional to two-dimensional signal based on relation of different units of time-delay. The tremor fluctuation was defined as the area of 95% confidence ellipse covering the two-dimensional signal. Experimenting with 32 PD and 20 ET subjects, a ratio of fluctuation of resting to kinetic task can be a sensitive feature to discriminate PD from ET with 100% accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Abnormally synchronized neural oscillations within the subthalamic nucleus have been proposed as a contributor to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. Recent studies have demonstrated phase-amplitude coupling between beta rhythms and high frequency oscillations in the subthalamic nucleus in unmedicated Parkinsonian patients. However, the nature of this coupling remains unclear. In this study, we first show the presence of nonlinear interactions between different frequency bands of oscillations. Then, we demonstrate that the amplitude of spatially localized high frequency activity is phase coupled with widespread beta oscillations within the subthalamic nucleus.",

    "abstract": "A widely accepted functional motor test for measuring basic mobility capabilities is the `Timed Up-and-Go' (TUG) test. Although several basic mobility tasks are included, only the total time is used as outcome parameter. It has been shown that timings of sub-phases can be used as relevant clinical parameters for the assessment of Parkinson's disease patients. A variety of systems and methods have been proposed for instrumenting the TUG test, but only limited information has been published regarding phase classification. In this paper an automated TUG phase classification methodology is proposed and validated in a study with 16 Parkinson's disease patients. Statistical, signal energy, chronological and gait features were extracted from acceleration and orientation signals of shoe mounted inertial measurement units. The phases `sit to walk', `walking', `first turn', `second turn' and `turn to sit' were segmented in a two stage classifier approach. Strides were used for a separation of the walking phase and classifiers like NaiveBayes, k-Nearest-Neighbor, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest for the final phase segmentation. SVM performed best with a mean sensitivity of 81.80% over all phases. Additionally, the impact of UPDRS and Hoehn & Yahr ratings on the phase times was assessed. The proposed methodology could be used to analyze gait parameters of sub-phases like stride length, stride time, foot clearance, heel-strike or toe-off angle for an improved assessment of Parkinson's disease patients.",

Thus, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is used to examine the areas engaged in PD neurodegeneration. In the present study, we computed average tract length and fiber volume as a measure of white matter integrity and adopted Network Based Statistics (NBS) to conduct group analyses between age- and gender-matched PD patients and healthy control connectivity matrices. NBS is a powerful statistical tool that utilizes the presence of every link in connectivity matrices and controls family wise error rates (in weak sense). The major regions with significantly reduced interconnecting fiber volume or average tract length were cingulum, temporal lobe, frontal lobe, parahippocampus, hippocampus, olfactory lobe, and occipital lobe.",

    "abstract": "Characterization of normal and abnormal Gait has been a major research field for decades, whether in fall prevention, sports biomechanics or even disease indication. In this paper, we assess time domain statistical properties of the Vertical Ground Reaction Force (VGRF) during moderate-pace walking, aiming eventually to create a reliable mathematical model of VGRF for normal and abnormal cases. For that endeavor, first order statistical analysis was performed upon signal segmentation in order to determine the degree of stationarity and base the model upon it. Furthermore, we performed curve fitting of the VGRF time series between present and past values, which led us to model the waveform with linear regression via Autoregressive Model for both Normal Walking Signals and Parkinson diseased patients' walking signals. However this is done only for one chosen sensor. However, it would be crucial to take the advantage of the array of sensors. Evaluating the cross-covariance between multi-sensor data of a given subject at different time lags capture the most important information. The seasonality in the values give a quite important indications of the behavior of data. The objective behind this analysis is to recommend a preliminary basis to create reliable mathematical model of normal walking signals versus pathological walking signals, that we will emphasize in a complementary work, in the simplest way available and creating fall prevention indicators for old patients.",

FOG interferes with daily activities and increases fall risk, which can cause severe health problems. We propose a novel smartphone-based system to detect FOG symptoms in an unconstrained way. The feasibility of single device to sense gait characteristic was tested on the various body positions such as ankle, trouser pocket, waist and chest pocket. Using measured data from accelerometer and gyroscope in the smartphone, machine learning algorithm was applied to classify freezing episodes from normal walking.

    "abstract": "The number of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease is increasing rapidly due to population aging. While traditional medications-based palliative therapy is successful in early stages, deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be used as an alternative treatment in later stages. After DBS implantation, the therapy typically consists of electrical stimulation and reduced medication. In order to provide good clinical outcome, a balance has to be found between medication and stimulation parameters, this is usually done as follows: First, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scoring is performed, second patients are supposed to fill subjective diaries during a specific period. This study shows that these diaries are useful as therapy progression indicator. Feel scores based on diaries and sleep time were examined with respect to DBS stimulation and medication. The results confirmed the positive effect of both therapy components--stimulation as well as medication--on patient feel scores. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between stimulation energy and sleep duration.",

    "abstract": "Postural instability is one of the main motor impairment of Parkinson's disease (PD). The Pull Test is the most common clinical examination to assess postural instability in PD. However, the subjectivity and low discriminative power of this test presents as a major drawback. In this paper we propose a novel methodology to estimate the Pull Test scores from patients with PD. We capture the relationship between the Pull Test outcomes and patients' foot motion patterns, using wearable sensors mounted on their shoes. 139 idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients performed four motor function tests, including walking and repetitive foot motions, while acceleration and orientation data was recorded. A total of 684 features were extracted from the acceleration and orientation signals. Feature selection and classification algorithms were utilized to estimate the Pull Test score for each participant. Further, we estimate which motor function test would better predict the Pull Test score, depending on the patient's phenotype (i.e. bradykinetic, tremor-dominant or equivalent). When combining all phenotypes and all tests, the mean of the classification probability distribution achieved was 0.75 (CI: [0.69-0.82]). Foot circling was the best predictive test for the equivalent patients (mean = 0.79, CI: [0.69-0.87]) and the bradykinetic patients (mean: 0.75, CI: [0.64-0.85]), while 2\u00d710 m. walk with stop-and-go proved superior for the tremor-dominant patients (mean: 0.75, CI: [0.64-0.85]). Overall, these results suggest that inertial data from patient's foot motion can be used to estimate postural instability in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the application of the LAMSTAR (LArge Memory STorage and Retrieval) neural network for prediction of onset of tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients to allow for on-off adaptive control of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). Currently, the therapeutic treatment of PD by DBS is an open-loop system where continuous stimulation is applied to a target area in the brain. This work demonstrates a fully automated closed-loop DBS system so that stimulation can be applied on-demand only when needed to treat PD symptoms. The proposed LAMSTAR network uses spectral, entropy and recurrence rate parameters for prediction of the advent of tremor after the DBS stimulation is switched off. These parameters are extracted from non-invasively collected surface electromyography and accelerometry signals. The LAMSTAR network has useful characteristics, such as fast retrieval of patterns and ability to handle large amount of data of different types, which make it attractive for medical applications. Out of 21 trials blue from one subject, the average ratio of delay in prediction of tremor to the actual delay in observed tremor from the time stimulation was switched off achieved by the proposed LAMSTAR network is 0.77. Moreover, sensitivity of 100% and overall performance better than previously proposed Back Propagation neural networks is obtained.",

    "abstract": "Continuous deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients results in side effects and shortening of the pacemaker battery life. This can be remedied using adaptive stimulation. To achieve adaptive DBS, patient customized PD detection is required due to the inconsistency associated with biomarkers across patients and time. This paper proposes the use of patient specific feature extraction together with adaptive support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to create a patient customized detector for PD. The patient specific feature extraction is obtained using the extrema of the ratio between the PD and non-PD spectra bands of each patient as features, while the adaptive SVM classifier adjusts its decision boundary until a suitable model is obtained. This yields individualised features and classifier pairs for each patient. Datasets containing local field potentials of PD patients were used to validate the method. Six of the nine patient datasets tested achieved a classification accuracy greater than 98%. The adaptive detector is suitable for realization on chip.",

In this contribution, we study the suitability of a Kinect v2 based system for supporting PD assessment in a clinical environment, in comparison to the original Kinect (v1). In this study, 3-D body joint data were acquired from both normal subjects, and PD patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS). Then, several gait parameters were extracted from the gathered data. The obtained results show that 96% of the considered parameters are appropriate for distinguishing between non-PD subjects, PD patients with DBS stimulator switched on, and PD patients with stimulator switched off (p-value <; 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). These results are markedly better than the ones obtained using Kinect v1, where only 73% of the parameters are considered appropriate (p-value <; 0.001).",

    "abstract": "Introduction. Levodopa is the gold-standard for treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) related motor symptoms. In this study, we used pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) to quantify changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) after acute oral administration of levodopa in PD patients. Materials and Methods. Thirteen patients (3 females, age 66.2 \u00b1 8.7 years) with moderately advanced PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage >2 (median 2.5), disease duration >3 years) were scanned on a 3T Siemens MR scanner before and after oral levodopa administration. Statistical parametric mapping was used to detect drug-induced changes in CBF and its correlation to clinical severity scales. Images were normalized and flipped in order to examine effects on the more affected (left) and less affected (right) cerebral hemispheres across the cohort. Results. Levodopa did not change global CBF but increased regional CBF in dorsal midbrain, precuneus/cuneus, more affected inferior frontal pars opercularis and triangularis, bilateral pre- and postcentral gyri, more affected inferior parietal areas, as well as less affected putamen/globus pallidus by 27-74% (p < 0.05, FWE corrected for multiple comparisons). CBF change was negatively correlated with improvement in bradykinesia UPDRS-III subscore in the more affected precentral gyrus, and total predrug UPDRS-III score in the mid-cingulate region. Drug-induced CBF change in a widespread network of regions including parietal and postcentral areas was also negatively correlated with the predrug rigidity UPDRS-III subscore. Conclusion. These findings are in line with prior reports of abnormal activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of PD patients and demonstrate the feasibility of pCASL as a neuroimaging tool for investigating in vivo physiological effects of acute drug administration in PD.",

    "abstract": "Extracampine hallucinations (EH), the sense of a presence or fleeting movement in the absence of an associated visual percept, have been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients but their prevalence, characteristics, and temporal relationship to visual hallucinations (VH) remain unclear. Given that, VH are predictive of cognitive impairment in PD, improved understanding of EH may have significant prognostic implications. The objective of this study is to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of EH in a large unselected population with PD and to assess the temporal relationship between EH, VH, and memory decline. Cross-sectional data were collected from 414 PD patients using a questionnaire circulated via an online patient community. Data were obtained regarding the occurrence, timing, and characteristics of VH and EH and symptoms of PD, disease duration, disease severity, and medication history. About 50.4% of respondents reported EH and 15.5% reported VH. EH were typically experienced alongside, rather than behind, the individual (p\u2009<\u20090.001) without clear lateralization (p\u2009=\u20090.438) and were more likely to be of unfamiliar presences (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The occurrence of EH was associated with Hoehn and Yahr score (p\u2009=\u20090.002) but not disease duration (p\u2009=\u20090.158). EH onset was associated with VH onset (p\u2009=\u20090.046) and occurred after the onset of anosmia (p\u2009<\u20090.001), cognitive decline (p\u2009=\u20090.002), and sleep disturbance (p\u2009=\u20090.002). The reported prevalence of EH in PD patients was threefold greater than that of VH, with similar timings of onset, suggesting that EH are under-recognized and under-reported. Further work is needed to determine whether EH are predictive of cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Over half of the general population does not achieve recommended daily levels of physical activity, and activity levels in people with Parkinson disease (PD) are lower than in healthy older adults. Dance can serve as an adjunct to traditional treatments to improve gait, balance, and quality of life in people with PD. This study directly compares a tango dance intervention and a dance intervention based on the Dance for PD model, which integrates multiple dance styles. Eleven people with PD participated in a community-based mixed styles dance intervention called Dance for Parkinson's (D4PD). Participants in the D4PD group were matched to participants in an ongoing community-based exercise study who participated in tango dance. The groups received 12\u2009weeks of intervention, attending 1-h group classes twice a week. Participants were evaluated off anti-PD medication before and after intervention. Measures of balance, repeated sit-to-stand performance and endurance (mini-balance evaluation systems test, four square step test, five times sit to stand, 6-min walk time) improved from pre to post similarly in both groups. Motor sign severity (movement disorders society unified Parkinson disease rating scale motor subsection) and functional mobility (timed up and go) improved in the tango group and worsened in the D4PD group. Gait velocity was not affected by either intervention. Direct comparisons of different interventions are -critical for developing optimal exercise interventions designed to specifically target motor impairments in PD. Tango dance interventions may preferentially improve mobility and motor signs in people with PD, compared to D4PD.",

    "abstract": "Growth/differentiation factor-15 (Gdf-15) is a member of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily and a pleiotropic, widely distributed cytokine, which has been shown to play roles in various pathologies, including inflammation. Analysis of Gdf-15(-/-) mice has revealed that it serves the postnatal maintenance of spinal cord motor neurons and sensory neurons. In a previous study, exogenous Gdf-15 rescued 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned Gdf-15(+/+) nigrostriatal dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in vitro and in vivo. Whether endogenous Gdf-15 serves the physiological maintenance of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons in health and disease is not known and was addressed in the present study. Stereotactic injection of 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) led to a significant decline in the numbers of DAergic neurons in both Gdf-15(+/+) and Gdf-15(-/-) mice over a time-period of 14days. However, this decrease was exacerbated in the Gdf-15(-/-) mice, with only 5.5% surviving neurons as compared to 24% in the Gdf-15(+/+) mice. Furthermore, the microglial response to the 6-OHDA lesion was reduced in Gdf-15(-/-) mice, with significantly lower numbers of total and activated microglia and a differential cytokine expression as compared to the Gdf-15(+/+) mice. Using in vitro models, we could demonstrate the importance of endogenous Gdf-15 in promoting DAergic neuron survival thus highlighting its relevance in a direct neurotrophic supportive role. Taken together, these results indicate the importance of Gdf-15 in promoting survival of DAergic neurons and regulating the inflammatory response post 6-OHDA lesion.",

    "abstract": "Many of the symptoms and signs of Parkinson's disease (PD) arise from the death of midbrain dopamine neurons that utilize tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis.\nWe investigated whether the presence of a common TH polymorphism affects the clinical outcomes in 101 PD subjects. We further examined the effect of this polymorphism on the purified recombinant enzyme.\nPD subjects homozygous for the common V81M polymorphism, have higher overall freezing of gait scores after controlling for disease duration, although this polymorphism does not associate with the occurrence of PD or FOG. In vitro functional assays on pure recombinant wild type TH and V81M TH revealed that the Km of the mutant enzyme for tyrosine was twice that of the wild-type. This polymorphism, however, did not change the stability of the enzyme, nor did it affect the Vmax or Km for the co-substrate BH4.\nThe data suggest that presence of a homozygous V81M polymorphism is associated with more severe FOG, possibly due to lower catecholamine synthetic capacity. Further studies are warranted to investigate the role of subtle changes in catecholamine availability in the development of FOG.",

    "abstract": "Although restoration of mitochondrial function in mitochondrial diseases through peptide-mediated allogeneic mitochondrial delivery (PMD) has been demonstrated in vitro, the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of PMD in Parkinson's disease (PD) has yet to be determined. In this study, we compared the functionality of mitochondrial transfer with or without Pep-1 conjugation in neurotoxin (6-hydroxydopamine, 6-OHDA)-induced PC12 cells and PD rat models. We injected mitochondria into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) of the PD rats after subjecting the nigrostriatal pathway to a unilateral 6-OHDA lesion for 21 days, and we verified the effectiveness of the mitochondrial graft in enhancing mitochondrial function in the soma of the substantia nigra (SN) neuron through mitochondrial transport dynamics in the nigrostriatal circuit. The result demonstrated that only PMD with allogeneic and xenogeneic sources significantly sustained mitochondrial function to resist the neurotoxin-induced oxidative stress and apoptotic death in the rat PC12 cells. The remaining cells exhibited a greater capability of neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, allogeneic and xenogeneic transplantation of peptide-labeled mitochondria after 3 months improved the locomotive activity in the PD rats. This increase was accompanied by a marked decrease in dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and consistent enhancement of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive immunoreaction of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc and striatum. We also observed that in the SN dopaminergic neuron in the treated PD rats, mitochondrial complex I protein and mitochondrial dynamics were restored, thus ameliorating the oxidative DNA damage. Moreover, we determined signal translocation of graft allogeneic mitochondria from the MFB to the calbindin-positive SN neuron, which demonstrated the regulatory role of mitochondrial transport in alleviating 6-OHDA-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder around the world. Levodopa has remained the \"gold standard\" of the therapy even several decades after its introduction. Chronic levodopa treatment is associated with the development of motor complications in most patients. Advanced Parkinson's disease is characterized by these complications: motor and non-motor fluctuation and disturbing dyskinesia. Continuous dopaminergic stimulation might reduce these complications. In advanced Parkinson's disease levodopa is still effective. In the treatment of this stage there are several advanced or device-aided therapies: apomorphine pump, deep brain stimulation and levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel. Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel is an aqueous gel that can be delivered to the jejunum via a percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube which is connected to an infusion pump dosing the levodopa gel continuously to the place of absorption. Levodopa/carbidopa gel infusion can be used as monotherapy, can be tested, can be used individually and this therapy is reversible. Several clinical trials demonstrated that levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel therapy is of long-term benefit, improves the quality of life of the patients and can reduce motor fluctuation and dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate voice of Iranian patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and find any relationship between motor disabilities and acoustic voice parameters as speech motor components. We evaluated 27 Farsi-speaking PD patients and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy persons as control. Motor performance was assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III and Hoehn and Yahr rating scale in the \"on\" state. Acoustic voice evaluation, including fundamental frequency (f0), standard deviation of f0, minimum of f0, maximum of f0, shimmer, jitter, and harmonic to noise ratio, was done using the Praat software via /a/ prolongation. No difference was seen between the voice of the patients and the voice of the controls. f0 and its variation had a significant correlation with the duration of the disease, but did not have any relationships with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III. Only limited relationship was observed between voice and motor disabilities. Tremor is an important main feature of PD that affects motor and phonation systems. Females had an older age at onset, more prolonged disease, and more severe motor disabilities (not statistically significant), but phonation disorders were more frequent in males and showed more relationship with severity of motor disabilities. Voice is affected by PD earlier than many other motor components and is more sensitive to disease progression. Tremor is the most effective part of PD that impacts voice. PD has more effect on voice of male versus female patients.",

    "abstract": "Opicapone is a novel, once-daily, potent third-generation catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of opicapone as an adjunct to levodopa compared with placebo or entacapone in patients with Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations.\nWe did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trial of opicapone as an adjunct to levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease with end-of-dose motor fluctuations. Patients aged 30-83 years were enrolled at 106 specialist centres across 19 European countries and Russia and were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) by a proprietary computer-generated sequence to oral treatment with opicapone (5 mg, 25 mg, or 50 mg once daily), placebo, or entacapone (200 mg with every levodopa intake) for 14-15 weeks. Patients and investigators (ie, outcome assessors) were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to end of study treatment in absolute time in the off state, as assessed by daily paper patient diaries; the primary analysis followed a hierarchical procedure for each opicapone dose in which superiority compared with placebo in the full analysis set was first tested and then, if positive, non-inferiority to entacapone was tested in the per-protocol set with a margin of 30 min. This trial is registered with EudraCT, 2010-021860-13, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01568073.\nBetween March 31, 2011, and Nov 30, 2013, of 679 patients screened, 600 were randomly assigned. 590 patients were included in the full analysis set (120 in the placebo group, 120 in the entacapone group, 119 in the opicapone 5 mg group, 116 in the opicapone 25 mg group, and 115 in the opicapone 50 mg group) and 537 in the per-protocol set (112 in the placebo group, 104 in the entacapone group, 110 in the opicapone 5 mg group, 105 in the opicapone 25 mg group, and 106 in the opicapone 50 mg group). The mean change in time in the off state was -56\u00b70 min (SE 13\u00b74; 95% CI -82\u00b73 to -29\u00b77) for placebo, -96\u00b73 min (13\u00b74; -122\u00b76 to -70\u00b70) for entacapone, -91\u00b73 min (13\u00b75; -117\u00b77 to -64\u00b78) for opicapone 5 mg, -85\u00b79 min (13\u00b77; -112\u00b78 to -59\u00b71) for opicapone 25 mg, and -116\u00b78 min (14\u00b70; -144\u00b72 to -89\u00b74) for opicapone 50 mg. Treatment with opicapone 50 mg was superior to placebo (mean difference in change from baseline -60\u00b78 min, 95% CI -97\u00b72 to -24\u00b74; p=0\u00b70015) and non-inferior to entacapone (-26\u00b72 min, -63\u00b78 to 11\u00b74; p=0\u00b70051). Treatment with opicapone 5 mg (p=0\u00b7056) or 25 mg (p=0\u00b7080) was not significantly different from treatment with placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 60 (50%) of 121 patients in the placebo group, 69 (57%) of 122 in the entacapone group, 63 (52%) of 122 in the opicapone 5 mg group, 65 (55%) of 119 in the opicapone 25 mg group, and 62 (54%) of 115 in the opicapone 50 mg group. The most common adverse events were dyskinesia (in five patients in the placebo group, ten in the entacapone group, 17 in the opicapone 5 mg group, nine in the opicapone 25 mg group, and 18 in the opicapone 50 mg group), insomnia (in one, seven, two, seven, and seven patients, respectively), and constipation (in three, five, four, none, and seven patients, respectively). Serious adverse events were reported in six patients in the placebo group, eight in the entacapone group, four each in the opicapone 5 mg and opicapone 50 mg groups, and one in the opicapone 25 mg group.\nThe addition of opicapone 50 mg to levodopa treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations could enable a simplified drug regimen that allows physicians to individually tailor the existing levodopa daily regimen, by potentially reducing the total daily levodopa dose, increasing the dosing interval, and ultimately reducing the number of intakes, thereby maximising its benefit.\nBIAL.",

    "abstract": "A recent study identified a missense mutation in coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain-containing 2 (CHCHD2) gene, p.Thr61Ile, in a Japanese multigenerational family with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). Subsequent analyses identified several genetic variants in this gene that contributed to increased risk of sporadic PD, making CHCHD2 a novel candidate gene associated with PD. However, independent studies are warranted to confirm the role of CHCHD2 in PD. Among 1433 participated subjects, we sequenced all exons and exon-intron boundaries of CHCHD2 from 137 probands with familial PD and 129 age/sex-matched controls. An additional 586 sporadic PD patients and another 581 independent controls were later screened to validate possible risk substitutions. We found no CHCHD2 mutations, but we observed 5 genetic variants, including p.Pro2Leu (rs142444896), a risk variant for sporadic PD in Japanese populations. However, we did not find any significant associations between p.Pro2Leu (rs142444896) and risk of PD in our study cohort (0.86% vs. 1.20%, p\u00a0= 0.20). Our data suggest that genetic variants of CHCHD2 do not play a major role in our Taiwanese PD population.",

    "abstract": "The literature on the effect of head injuries on the risk of PD is inconclusive. Some researchers have hypothesized that studies that have seen an effect are simply capturing injury related to pre-clinical PD. However in animal models brain inflammation, which can be initiated by head trauma, has been shown to produce PD-like effects. Furthermore, animal studies have found that early life inflammation in particular is of relevance for PD pathology.\nWe conducted an unmatched case-control study of 379 neurologist confirmed PD patients and 230 controls from the greater Boston, Massachusetts area with questionnaire data on history of head injury and other covariates. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for PD.\nWhen we excluded injuries that occurred less than 10 years prior to the diagnosis of PD (in order to avoid reverse causation), we found an increased risk of PD associated with a head injury that resulted in a loss of consciousness, but it did not reach statistical significance (OR = 1.57; 95% CI = 0.89-2.80). We found a significant (p = 0.04) effect of age at first head injury. For every 5 year earlier age at first head injury with loss of consciousness the OR for PD was 1.37 (95% CI: 1.01-1.86).\nOur results suggest that head injury in early life increases the risk of PD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and cognitive impairment in PD have overlapping clinical and pathological features. To examine whether there is a genetic link for these diseases, we performed a case-control study in Chinese population to evaluate the association of AD genome-wide association studies top hits with both PD and cognitive function in PD, investigating 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 9 genes (BIN1, CLU, ABCA7, CR1, PICALM, MS4A6A, CD33, MS4A4E, and CD2AP). A total of 454 controls and 442 PD patients were genotyped, including 75 mild cognitive impairment and 99 dementia. As a result, no significant association of the AD-susceptibility loci was identified in PD cases, PD-dementia, or PD-mild cognitive impairment. Our findings imply that the 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms from AD genome-wide association studies may not play major role in the genetic predisposition with PD and cognitive function in PD in a Chinese population.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the relatively selective depletion of dopamine in the striatum, which consequently leads to dysfunctions in cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuitries. It has been shown that the most common cognitive deficits in PD patients are related to the fronto-striatal circuits. In PD, most previous functional connectivity studies have been performed using seed-based methods to identify the brain regions that are abnormally connected to one or more seeds, but these cannot be used to quantify the interactions between one region and all other regions in a particular network. Functional connectivity degree, which is a measurement that can be used to quantify the functional or structural connectivity of a complex brain network, was adopted in this study to assess the interactions of the fronto-striatal network. Compared to healthy controls, PD patients had significantly decreased total functional connectivity degree for the left putamen and the right globus pallidum in fronto-striatal networks. Additionally, negative correlations between the fronto-pallial functional connectivity degree (i.e., the right globus pallidum with the left middle frontal gyrus, and with the right triangular part of inferior frontal gyrus) and disease duration were observed in PD patients. The results of this study demonstrate that fronto-striatal functional connectivity is abnormal in patients with PD and indicate that these deficits might be the result of motor and cognitive dysfunctions in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Falling is one of the most common and serious public health problems. It can cause injuries such as sprains and fractures, and hospitalization may be required for serious injuries. Patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk of falls, and urinary incontinence is a known risk factor for falls in the elderly. However, whether other urinary disturbances contribute to the risk of falling remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify the association between falls and urinary disturbances in Parkinson's disease.\nA prospective cohort study was conducted at a single institution with a 6-month observation period. Subjects were ambulatory patients with Parkinson's disease. Assessments included patient demographics, disease severity measured by the Hoehn and Yahr scale, and urinary disturbances measured using the overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS). Falls were reported using a self-documented fall record.\nA total of 97 patients were included. Forty-four subjects experienced one or more falls during the observation period. The frequency of urination was not related to falling; however, mild urinary urgency, but not severe urinary urgency, increased the risk of falls by an odds ratio of 5.14 (95% confidence interval: 1.51-17.48). Mild urinary urgency was also associated with the time to the first fall and the frequency of falls. One third of falls occurred in the living room, and 13.8% of falls occurred on the way to/from the toilet.\nFalls in patients with Parkinson's disease might be associated with urinary urgency, but not with the frequency of urination.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms (NMS) are gaining increasing relevance in the management of Parkinson's disease (PD), but little is known about their progression, especially among patients with different ages.\nA total of 117 PD patients who were divided into four age groups (<50, 50-60, 60-70, and >70years old) were included to assess NMS at baseline and follow-up visit (21.6\u00b15.6months). The frequency and severity of NMS were assessed using the Non-Motor Symptom Scale (NMSS).\nAfter adjusting for confounding factors, patients at the last visit had significantly higher frequency of \"Difficulty falling asleep\" item (p=0.034) and \"Urinary\" domain (p=0.017), and higher total NMSS score (p=0.011) as well as scores for \"Sleep/fatigue\" (p=0.013) and \"Sexual dysfunction\" (p=0.014) domains and scores for \"Fatigue\" (p=0.004), \"Lack of motivation\" (p=0.033), \"Interest in sex\" (p=0.014) and \"Problems having sex\" (p=0.031) items than patients at baseline. The frequency changes of each NMS among four age groups exhibited an anfractuous result, while the annual severity changes of each NMS were not significant different among four age groups. Multinomial logistic regression model indicated that age had no correlation with the changes of NMS frequency and severity.\nThe severity of NMS in PD tends to become progressively worse with the course of the disease. Age is not related to the progression of NMS in PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore the genetic association of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) gene promoter region polymorphisms with Parkinson's disease (PD) susceptibility in Chinese Han population.\nThe genotyping of COX2 gene polymorphisms was conducted by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 122 patients with PD and 120 healthy persons. The association strength of gene polymorphism with disease was measured by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) calculated using \u03c7(2) test which also evaluated the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) of gene polymorphism in controls. The linkage disequilibrium and haplotype were also analyzed as evidence in the analysis of association.\nOn condition that the genotypes distributions of COX2 -1290A>G, -1195G>A, -765G>C in the control group all conformed to HWE, however, only the homozygous genotype AA of -1195G>A polymorphism showed an association with PD (OR=0.432, 95% CI=0.196-0.950). In addition, in haplotype analysis, G-A-C haplotype frequency in cases was significantly lower than the controls, compared with the common haplotype A-G-G (P=0.031, OR=0.375, 95% CI=0.149-0.940).\nCOX2 -1195G>A polymorphism might play a protective role in the onset of PD and G-A-C haplotype in this three promoter region polymorphisms also showed a negative association.",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's disease have limited brain reserves of endogenous dopamine; thus, their medications must not be omitted or delayed as this may lead to a significant drop in brain dopamine levels. This has two main clinical consequences: first, a deterioration in disease control, with distressing symptoms such as tremor, pain, rigidity, dysphagia and immobility, and second, an increased risk of developing the life-threatening complication of neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome. Common reasons for people with Parkinson's disease being unable to take their oral medications are neurogenic dysphagia from progressive disease or concurrent illness, gastroenteritis, iatrogenic 'nil by mouth' status especially perioperatively, and impaired consciousness level. Here we outline alternative methods to give dopaminergic drugs in the acute setting to people with Parkinson's disease who cannot take their usual oral treatment, namely using dispersible preparations in thickened fluids, an enteral tube, a transdermal patch or subcutaneous injections.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) are associated with D3 overexpression in levodopa-treated humans with Parkinson disease (PD).\nIn this case-control study, we used PET with the D3-preferring radioligand [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO to estimate D2/3 receptor binding in patients with levodopa-treated PD with LID (n = 12) and without LID (n = 12), and healthy control subjects matched for age, sex, education, and mental status (n = 18).\nCompared to nondyskinetic patients, those with LID showed heightened [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the D3-rich globus pallidus. Both PD groups also showed higher binding than controls in the sensorimotor division of the striatum. In contrast, D2/3 binding in the ventral striatum was lower in patients with LID than without, possibly reflecting higher dopamine levels.\nDopaminergic abnormalities contributing to LID may include elevated D2/3 binding in globus pallidus, perhaps reflecting D3 receptor upregulation. The findings support therapeutic strategies that target and diminish activity at D3 to prevent LID.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the predictive value of striatal dopamine turnover in patients with de novo Parkinson disease (PD) for the onset of later motor complications.\nThis retrospective, observer-blinded cohort study followed up 31 patients with early PD who completed quantitative (18)F-dopa PET imaging to measure striatal (18)F-dopa uptake (Kocc) and effective distribution volume ratio (EDVR) as the inverse of dopamine turnover prior to antiparkinsonian treatment. The onset of wearing-off and dyskinesias was determined based on blinded clinical assessments and patient records. The predictive value of baseline PET measures for motor complications was evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models.\nDuring a mean follow-up time of 6.8 years, 18 (58.1%) patients developed wearing-off, 11 (35.5%) dyskinesia, and 20 (64.5%) any motor complication. Patients with dyskinesia and any motor complication showed lower baseline EDVR (higher dopamine turnover) in the putamen than those without dyskinesias and any motor complication, with differences most markedly present in the posterior putamen. Baseline EDVR in the whole and the posterior putamen predicted development of motor complications with an increasing risk with lower EDVR (higher dopamine turnover), whereas EDVR in other regions and Kocc did not correlate with motor complications. Correspondingly, Kaplan-Meier curves showed reduced survival from motor complications in patients with lower baseline EDVR (higher dopamine turnover) in the posterior putamen with ongoing levodopa treatment and disease duration.\nElevated putaminal dopamine turnover in de novo PD is associated with an increased risk for later motor complications and comprises a disease-intrinsic predisposing factor for their development.",

    "abstract": "Apathy is a common, disabling symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). The mechanisms underlying apathy in PD are still unclear, although they may be related to dysfunction in the meso-cortico-limbic circuit, including the ventral striatum. Thus, we performed this study to investigate whether dopamine depletion in the ventral striatum contributes to apathy in PD.\nWe conducted a survey of the degree of apathy (using the Korean version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale, AES-S) in 108 non-demented patients with PD who underwent dopamine transporter (DAT) positron emission tomography scans as an initial diagnostic work-up. Patients with AES-S scores of 37 or higher were defined as having apathetic PD. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to assess the severity of depression. Patients with BDI scores of 15 or higher were regarded as having depression.\nApathetic patients (n = 34) tended to exhibit higher BDI scores than non-apathetic patients (n = 74); however, other clinical variables were comparable between the two groups. DAT activity in the striatal sub-regions was also similar between the two groups. Selecting only non-depressed patients, including 20 apathetic and 47 non-apathetic patients, did not alter the results.\nThis study demonstrated that the pattern of striatal dopamine depletion does not contribute to the degree of apathy in early PD. Apathy in PD may be associated with extra-striatal lesions that accompany PD rather than striatal dopaminergic deficits.",

    "abstract": "In addition to the classic motor symptoms, Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a variety of nonmotor symptoms that significantly reduce quality of life, even in the early stages of the disease. There is an urgent need to develop evidence-based treatments for these symptoms, which include mood disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, and sleep disruption. We focus here on exercise interventions, which have been used to improve mood, cognition, and sleep in healthy older adults and clinical populations, but to date have primarily targeted motor symptoms in PD. We synthesize the existing literature on the benefits of aerobic exercise and strength training on mood, sleep, and cognition as demonstrated in healthy older adults and adults with PD, and suggest that these types of exercise offer a feasible and promising adjunct treatment for mood, cognition, and sleep difficulties in PD. Across stages of the disease, exercise interventions represent a treatment strategy with the unique ability to improve a range of nonmotor symptoms while also alleviating the classic motor symptoms of the disease. Future research in PD should include nonmotor outcomes in exercise trials with the goal of developing evidence-based exercise interventions as a safe, broad-spectrum treatment approach to improve mood, cognition, and sleep for individuals with PD.",

    "abstract": "Cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggests that Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with changes in cerebral tissue volume, diffusion tensor imaging metrics, and perfusion values. Here, we performed a longitudinal multimodal MRI study--including structural, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and perfusion MRI--to investigate progressive brain changes over one year in a group of older PD patients at a moderate stage of disease.\nTwenty-three non-demented PD (mean age (SD) = 69.5 (6.4) years, disease duration (SD) = 5.6 (4.3) years) and 23 matched control participants (mean age: 70.6 (6.8)) completed extensive neuropsychological and clinical assessment, and multimodal 3T MRI scanning at baseline and one year later. We used a voxel-based approach to assess change over time and group-by-time interactions for cerebral structural and perfusion metrics.\nCompared to controls, in PD participants there was localized grey matter atrophy over time in bilateral inferior and right middle temporal, and left orbito-frontal cortices. Using a voxel-based approach that focused on the centers of principal white matter tracts, the PD and control cohorts exhibited similar levels of change in DTI metrics. There was no significant change in perfusion, cognitive, or motor severity measures.\nIn a cohort of older, non-demented PD participants, macrostructural MRI detected atrophy in the PD group compared with the control group in temporal and orbito-frontal cortices. Changes in diffusion MRI along principal white matter tracts over one year were found, but this was not differentially affected by PD.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the potential of multimodal MR imaging including mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), relaxation rates R2 and R2* to detect disease specific alterations in Parkinson's Disease (PD). We enrolled 82 PD patients (PD-all) with varying disease durations (\u22645 years: PD\u22645, n = 43; >5 years: PD>5, n = 39) and 38 matched healthy controls (HC), receiving diffusion tensor imaging as well as R2 and R2* relaxometry calculated from multi-echo T2*-weighted and dual-echo TSE imaging, respectively. ROIs were drawn to delineate caudate nucleus (CN), putamen (PU), globus pallidus (GP) and substantia nigra (SN) on the co-registered maps. The SN was divided in 3 descending levels (SL 1-3). The most significant parameters were used for a flexible discrimination analysis (FDA) in a training collective consisting of 25 randomized subjects from each group in order to predict the classification of remaining subjects. PD-all showed significant increases in MD, R2 and R2* within SN and its subregions as well as in MD and R2* within different basal ganglia regions. Compared to the HC group, the PD\u22645 and the PD>5 group showed significant MD increases within the SN and its lower two subregions, while the PD\u22645 group exhibited significant increases in R2 and R2* within SN and its subregions, and tended to elevation within the basal ganglia. The PD>5 group had significantly increased MD in PU and GP, whereas the PD\u22645 group presented normal MD within the basal ganglia. FDA achieved right classification in 84% of study participants. Micro-structural damage affects primarily the SN of PD patients and in later disease stages the basal ganglia. Iron contents of PU, GP and SN are increased at early disease stages of PD.",

    "abstract": "Aim. This study sought to establish the discriminant validity of a rapid cognitive screen, that is, the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network (NINDS-CSN) 5-minute protocol, and compare its discriminant validity to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) in detecting cognitive impairment (CI) in PD patients. Methods. One hundred and one PD patients were recruited from a movement disorders clinic in Singapore and they received the NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol, MoCA, and MMSE. No cognitive impairment (NCI) was defined as Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) = 0 and CI was defined as CDR \u2265 0.5. Results. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol was statistically equivalent to MoCA and larger than MMSE (0.86 versus 0.90, P = 0.07; 0.86 versus 0.76, P = 0.03). The sensitivity of NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol (<9) was statistically equivalent to MoCA (<22) (0.77 versus 0.85, P = 0.13) and superior to MMSE (<24) (0.77 versus 0.52, P < 0.01) in detecting CI, while the specificity of NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol (<9) was statistically equivalent to MoCA (<22) and MMSE (<24) (0.78 versus 0.88, P = 0.34). Conclusion. The NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol is time expeditious while remaining statistically equivalent to MoCA and superior to MMSE and therefore is suitable for rapid cognitive screening of CI in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "The function of the nigro-striatal pathway on neuronal entropy in the basal ganglia (BG) output nucleus, i.e. the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) was investigated in the unilaterally 6-hyroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). In both control subjects and subjects with 6-OHDA lesion of dopamine (DA) the nigro-striatal pathway, a histological hallmark for parkinsonism, neuronal entropy in EPN was maximal in neurons with firing rates ranging between 15 and 25 Hz. In 6-OHDA lesioned rats, neuronal entropy in the EPN was specifically higher in neurons with firing rates above 25 Hz. Our data establishes that the nigro-striatal pathway controls neuronal entropy in motor circuitry and that the parkinsonian condition is associated with abnormal relationship between firing rate and neuronal entropy in BG output nuclei. The neuronal firing rates and entropy relationship provide putative relevant electrophysiological information to investigate the sensory-motor processing in normal condition and conditions such as movement disorders.",

    "abstract": "Depression and anxiety are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and contribute significantly to a reduced quality of life in PD patients. Though they often co-exist, it is unclear whether depression and anxiety result from a shared pathological process. We studied the longitudinal course and determinants of depression and anxiety in PD in order to understand which factors contribute to the development of these symptoms.\nWe conducted a prospective longitudinal study of 89 mild PD patients over 18 months, measuring depressive and anxiety symptoms at 6 monthly intervals using the Geriatric Depression Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale--'Anxiety' subscale. Univariate and multivariate Generalised Estimating Equations were used to investigate the course of depression and anxiety and their association with demographic factors, motor measures, non-motor symptoms, and pharmacological factors.\nDepression and anxiety were co-morbid in 13.5% of the sample. Depressive symptoms remained relatively stable while anxiety symptoms improved over the course of 18 months. Severity of depressive symptoms was associated with female gender, motor fluctuations, apathy, and anxiety, while severity of anxiety was associated with older age, higher educational attainment, shorter disease duration, younger age of disease onset, and excessive daytime sleepiness.\nAlthough depression and anxiety are frequently co-morbid in PD, they were dissociable from each other. They had distinct trajectories and different longitudinal relationships with demographic, motor, and non-motor factors that were unique to each disorder.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by low-level systemic inflammation, which may be at least partly due to pathophysiological activation of immunity. Here, the frequencies of different types of circulating dendritic cells (DCs) with and without a pro-inflammatory phenotype were determined in PD patients and controls. A high proportion of older people is infected with cytomegalovirus (CMV), which acts as a chronic antigenic stressor that could also contribute to increased inflammation. Following this idea, we found higher frequencies of myeloid DCs with a pro-inflammatory CD16+ILT2(high) phenotype in CMV-positive PD patients than controls, suggesting the potential involvement of CMV in exacerbating PD.",

    "abstract": "Pathological neural activity in subthalamic nucleus (STN) is closely related to the symptoms of Parkinson' s disease. Local field potentials (LFPs) recordings from subthalamic nucleus show that power spectral peaks exist at tremor, double tremor and tripble tremor frequencies, respectively. The interaction between these components in the multi-frequency tremor may be related to the generation of tremor. To study the linear and nonlinear relationship between those components, we analyzed STN LFPs from 9 Parkinson's disease patients using time frequency, cross correlation, Granger casuality and bi-spectral analysis. Results of the time-frequency analysis and cross-frequency correlation analysis demonstrated that the power density of those components significantly decreased as the alleviation of tremor and cross-correlation (0.18-0.50) exists during tremor period. Granger causality of the time-variant amplitude showed stronger contribution from tremor to double tremor components, and contributions from both tremor and double tremor components to triple tremor component. Quadratic phase couplings among these three components were detected by the bispectral approaches. The linear and nonlinear relationships existed among the multi-components and certainly confirmed that the dependence cross those frequencies and neurological mechanism of tremor involved complicate neural processes.",

    "abstract": "Continuous apomorphine infusion (CAI) is an effective treatment in fluctuating Parkinson's disease (PD). However, long-term efficacy and safety data of CAI are scarce.\nWe retrospectively reviewed long-term outcomes of CAI on motor and non-motor symptoms in a Dutch cohort of 125 PD patients.\nOur cohort (age: 65.8 \u00b1 9.8 years, disease duration: 11.9 \u00b1 5.7 years) had a mean daily dose of apomorphine of 66 \u00b1 30 mg, thereby reducing the levodopa-equivalent daily dose (LEDD) by 20%. The mean duration of treatment with apomorphine was 32.3 \u00b1 31.9 months, ranging up to 139 months. Three-quarters of patients discontinued within the first four years. The main reason for discontinuation was a decreasing therapeutic effect. Patients who stopped apomorphine within four years had a lower LEDD reduction at hospital discharge and at last follow-up compared to patients who continued for a longer period. CAI showed good effects on motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, with better outcomes in patients with more pronounced LEDD reduction. CAI could be safely applied in patients with pre-existing visual hallucinations (30%).\nCAI showed beneficial effects on motor and several non-motor symptoms, whereas the magnitude of LEDD reduction seems to be a positive predictive factor on the duration of CAI.",

    "abstract": "The existence of sex differences in Parkinson's disease (PD) incidence is well documented with greater prevalence and earlier age at onset in men than in women. These reported sex differences could be related to estrogen exposure. In PD animal models, estrogen is well documented to be neuroprotective against dopaminergic neuron loss induced by neurotoxins. Using the 1-methyl 4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model, we showed that several compounds are neuroprotective on dopaminergic neurons including estrogen, the selective estrogen receptor modulator raloxifene, progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, the estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) agonist PPT as well as the G protein-coupled membrane estrogen receptor (GPER1) specific agonist G1. Accumulating evidence suggests that GPER1 could be implicated in the neuroprotective effects of estrogen, raloxifene and G1 in collaboration with ER\u03b1. We recently reported that the 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor Dutasteride is also neuroprotective and could bring an alternative to estrogens for therapy in male. Additional studies are needed to optimize therapies with these gonadal drugs into safe personalized treatments according to sex for treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Stem cell technologies are particularly attractive in Parkinson's disease (PD) research although they occasionally need long-term treatment for anti-parkinsonian activity. Unfortunately, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) widely used as a model for PD has several limitations, including the risk of dose-dependent mortality and the difficulty of maintenance of PD symptoms during the whole experiment period. Therefore, we tested if our novel MPTP regimen protocol (2 mg/kg for 2 consecutive days and 1 mg/kg for next 3 consecutive days) can be maintained stable parkinsonism without mortality for long-term stem cell therapy. For this, we used small-bodied common marmoset monkeys (",

We hypothesized that the activities of lysosomal enzymes are altered in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) of patients with sPD and other genetic parkinsonism.\nGlucocerebrosidase and \u03b2-hexosaminidase activities in PBLs were measured in 36 patients with sPD, 5 PD patients with PARK2 mutations, 10 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 17 with parkinsonism, and 20 healthy controls.\nThe glucocerebrosidase and \u03b2-hexosaminidase activities were not different in patients with sPD, PD with PARK2 mutations, and SCA17 with parkinsonism from those of the controls. In the patients with sPD, the activity of GCase was positively correlated with disease duration.\nThe glucocerebrosidase and \u03b2-hexosaminidase activities in PBLs cannot be used as a biomarker in sPD and other genetic parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "Apathy is one of the most common behavioural disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) and contributes significantly to a reduced quality of life in PD patients.\nWe conducted a prospective longitudinal study of 89 mild PD patients over 18 months, measuring apathy symptoms at 6-monthly intervals using the Starkstein Apathy Scale, as well as measures of motor and non-motor symptoms, cognitive function, and functional disability at baseline. Mixed-effects models were used to characterise the individual trajectories of apathy symptom severity, and linear regression with stepwise elimination procedure was used to select significant baseline predictors.\nClinically significant levels of apathy were present in 42.7% of our sample at baseline, with symptom severity remaining relatively stable on average over the course of 18 months. Male gender, lower educational attainment, higher depression symptom severity, more severe functional disability, and the presence of dyskinesias at study entry predicted increasing apathy over the subsequent 18 months.\nPatients with these factors are at risk for progression of apathy, which may be prevented by treating depression and functional disability. Further studies are needed to address both the specific neurobiological pathways and psychosocial factors underpinning apathy in PD.",

    "abstract": "Modified non-motor brainstem ventilatory control might be involved in Parkinson's disease. Our study was designed to investigate the impact of degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway on resting breathing and hypoxic ventilatory response in conscious rats. The role of central and peripheral dopamine D2 receptors in the modulation of the hypoxic ventilatory response in conditions of dopamine shortage was examined. Adult Wistar rats received a unilateral double 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the right medial forebrain bundle. After surgery, animals were placed in whole-body plethysmographic chamber and exposed to hypoxia (8% O2). One group of animals received inraperitoneal injections of either haloperidol or domperidone before hypoxia. Levels of dopamine and its metabolite in the brainstem and striatum were assessed. Neurotoxin treatment evoked limb use asymmetry. No effect on the resting normoxic respiration was observed. An increase in tidal volume and a decrease in respiratory rate during respiratory response to hypoxia with short magnification of minute ventilation were predominant effects. Domperidone treatment in intact animals evoked a significant increase in normoxic tidal volume, while haloperidol potentiated tidal volume increase in response to hypoxia. After the lesion, the effects of both antagonists were absent. In rats with Parkinson's, the content of dopamine and its metabolite decreased substantially in the injured striatum. Augmentation of a tidal volume response to hypoxia, and the absence of stimulatory effect of intraperitoneal domperidone on normoxic and haloperidol on hypoxic tidal volume, in lesioned rats indicated altered control of breathing. This could be the result of a dopamine deficiency in the striatum and an increased turnover of DOPAC/DA in the brainstem.",

    "abstract": "Conventional single tensor diffusion analysis models have provided mixed findings in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease, but recent work using a bi-tensor analysis model has shown more promising results. Using a bi-tensor model, free-water values were found to be increased in the posterior substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease compared with controls at a single site and in a multi-site cohort. Further, free-water increased longitudinally over 1 year in the posterior substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease. Here, we test the hypothesis that other parkinsonian disorders such as multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy have elevated free-water in the substantia nigra. Equally important, however, is whether the bi-tensor diffusion model is able to detect alterations in other brain regions beyond the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy and to accurately distinguish between these diseases. Free-water and free-water-corrected fractional anisotropy maps were compared across 72 individuals in the basal ganglia, midbrain, thalamus, dentate nucleus, cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar vermis and lobules V and VI, and corpus callosum. Compared with controls, free-water was increased in the anterior and posterior substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Despite no other changes in Parkinson's disease, we observed elevated free-water in all regions except the dentate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, and corpus callosum of multiple system atrophy, and in all regions examined for progressive supranuclear palsy. Compared with controls, free-water-corrected fractional anisotropy values were increased for multiple system atrophy in the putamen and caudate, and increased for progressive supranuclear palsy in the putamen, caudate, thalamus, and vermis, and decreased in the superior cerebellar peduncle and corpus callosum. For all disease group comparisons, the support vector machine 10-fold cross-validation area under the curve was between 0.93-1.00 and there was high sensitivity and specificity. The regions and diffusion measures selected by the model varied across comparisons and are consistent with pathological studies. In conclusion, the current study used a novel bi-tensor diffusion analysis model to indicate that all forms of parkinsonism had elevated free-water in the substantia nigra. Beyond the substantia nigra, both multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, but not Parkinson's disease, showed a broad network of elevated free-water and altered free-water corrected fractional anisotropy that included the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum. These findings may be helpful in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders, and thereby facilitate the development and assessment of targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "The higher cortical burden of Lewy body and Alzheimer disease-type pathology has been reported to be associated with a faster onset of cognitive impairment of Parkinson disease. So far, there has been a few studies only about the changes of gray matter volume depending on duration of cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the different patterns of structural and functional changes in Parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment according to the duration of parkinsonism before mild cognitive impairment.\nFifty-nine patients with Parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment were classified into 2 groups on the basis of shorter (<1 year, n = 16) and longer (\u22651 year, n = 43) durations of parkinsonism before mild cognitive impairment. Fifteen drug-na\u00efve patients with de novo Parkinson disease with intact cognition were included for comparison. Cortical thickness, Tract-Based Spatial Statistics, and seed-based resting-state functional connectivity analyses were performed. Age, sex, years of education, age at onset of parkinsonism, and levodopa-equivalent dose were included as covariates.\nThe group with shorter duration of parkinsonism before mild cognitive impairment showed decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean and radial diffusivity values in the frontal areas compared with the group with longer duration of parkinsonism before mild cognitive impairment (corrected P < .05). The group with shorter duration of parkinsonism before mild cognitive impairment showed decreased resting-state functional connectivity in the default mode network area when the left or right posterior cingulate was used as a seed, and in the dorsolateral prefrontal areas when the left or right caudate was used as a seed (corrected P < .05). The group with longer duration of parkinsonism before mild cognitive impairment showed decreased resting-state functional connectivity mainly in the medial prefrontal cortex when the left or right posterior cingulate was used as a seed, and in the parieto-occipital areas when the left or right caudate was used as a seed (corrected P < .05). No differences in cortical thickness were found in all group contrasts.\nResting-state functional connectivity and WM alterations might be useful imaging biomarkers for identifying changes in patients with Parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment according to the duration of parkinsonism before mild cognitive impairment. The functional and microstructural substrates may topographically differ depending on the rate of cognitive decline in these patients.",

    "abstract": "We studied activities of daily living (ADL) in Parkinson disease (PD) to identify the cognitive ADL impairments that could differentiate patients with PD dementia from those without dementia.\nMost people with PD have impairments in their ADL, making it difficult to distinguish between those caused by cognitive or motor dysfunction.\nWe evaluated 24 patients with PD dementia and 48 with PD without dementia. For comparison, we evaluated 24 patients with Alzheimer disease and 25 healthy control participants. Caregivers completed the instrumental ADL scale, allowing us to examine participants' actual activity (actual score) and cognitive ability to perform certain ADL (cognitive score).\nThe nondemented patients with PD had better actual scores than those with dementia. The patients with PD dementia had significantly worse cognitive scores for keeping appointments and for talking about recent events, followed by managing money, using a telephone, and cooking. A comparison of the actual and cognitive scores revealed significant differences between the two PD groups, suggesting the physical impact of PD on certain ADL. Factor analysis confirmed that ADL items could be separated into cognitive and physical components.\nAlthough most patients with PD had difficulties in ADL, we identified specific cognitive ADL items that could help in differentiating patients with and without dementia.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in CHCHD2 gene have been reported in autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (ADPD). However, there is still lack of evidence supported CHCHD2 mutations lead to ADPD in other populations. We performed whole exome sequencing, positron emission tomography (PET), and haplotype analyses in an ADPD pedigree and then comprehensively screened for CHCHD2 gene mutations in additional 18 familial parkinsonism pedigrees, 364 sporadic PD patients, and 384 healthy controls to assess the frequencies of known and novel rare nonsynonymous CHCHD2 mutations. We identified a heterozygous variant (c.182C>T; p.Thr61Ile) in the CHCHD2 gene in the ADPD pedigree. PET revealed a significant reduction in dopamine transporter binding in the putamen and caudate nucleus of the proband, similar to idiopathic PD. The single nucleotide variant 5C>T (Pro2Leu) in CHCHD2 was confirmed to have a significantly higher frequency among sporadic PD patients than controls. Our results confirm that ADPD can be caused by CHCHD2 mutations and show that the Pro2Leu variant in CHCHD2 may be a risk factor for sporadic PD in Chinese populations.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease and is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra. Recently, rs75932628 (p.R47H) of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 gene (TREM2) was identified to be associated with PD in American, Spanish, Irish, and Polish population. To explore whether TREM2 variants are related to susceptibility of sporadic PD in Chinese Han population, we designed a case-control comparison study and studied two variants rs75932628 (p.R47H) and rs2234253 (p.T96K) of the TREM2 gene in 512 Chinese Han patients with sporadic PD and 512 age, gender and ethnicity matched normal controls from Mainland China. No variant for either rs75932628 or rs2234253 was found in both PD and control cohorts. Our data suggest that neither variant rs75932628 nor rs2234253 be a major susceptibility factor of sporadic PD in Chinese Han population from Mainland China.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective surgical option for treating Parkinson's disease (PD). DBS is invasive, with a high initial cost. In Japan, questions have been raised about its cost-effectiveness and the resulting improvements in outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DBS for PD in Japan, particularly whether early or late DBS is more cost-effective.\nWe used a Markov cohort simulation to follow the clinical course of DBS for PD. We conducted a survey to capture QOL scores among healthy Japanese volunteers. Transition probabilities were estimated from randomized clinical trials. We determined direct medical costs from the perspective of the Japanese health care system. Outcomes were assessed as quality-adjusted life years. We conducted univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.\nDBS costs an additional 10.3 million Japanese yen (US$85,100; exchange rate on October 28, 2015 was 121 yen to $1) for a gain of 3.2 quality-adjusted life years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 3.1 million yen ($25,600). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 8.5 million yen ($70,200) for early DBS, 3.1 million yen ($25,600) for intermediate DBS, and 3.3 million yen ($27,200) for late-stage DBS.\nOur model suggests that DBS is cost-effective in the Japanese health care system. DBS is more cost-effective if performed in the intermediate rather than early or late stages of PD.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the role of the dopamine system [i.e., subcortical-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) network] in dreaming, by studying patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) as a model of altered dopaminergic transmission. Subcortical volumes and cortical thickness were extracted by 3T-MR images of 27 PD patients and 27 age-matched controls, who were asked to fill out a dream diary upon morning awakening for one week. PD patients do not substantially differ from healthy controls with respect to the sleep, dream, and neuroanatomical measures. Multivariate correlational analyses in PD patients show that dopamine agonist dosage is associated to qualitatively impoverished dreams, as expressed by lower bizarreness and lower emotional load values. Visual vividness (VV) of their dream reports positively correlates with volumes of both the amygdalae and with thickness of the left mPFC. Emotional load also positively correlates with hippocampal volume. Beside the replication of our previous finding on the role of subcortical nuclei in dreaming experience of healthy subjects, this represents the first evidence of a specific role of the amygdala-mPFC dopaminergic network system in dream recall. The association in PD patients between higher dopamine agonist dosages and impoverished dream reports, however, and the significant correlations between VV and mesolimbic regions, however, provide an empirical support to the hypothesis that a dopamine network plays a key role in dream generation. The causal relation is however precluded by the intrinsic limitation of assuming the dopamine agonist dosage as a measure of the hypodopaminergic state in PD. Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "One of the key molecular events underlying the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the aberrant misfolding and aggregation of the \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S) protein into higher-order oligomers that play a key role in neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. A wealth of experimental data supports the hypothesis that the neurotoxicity of \u03b1S oligomers is intrinsically linked with their ability to interact with, and disrupt, biological membranes; especially those membranes having negatively-charged surfaces and/or lipid packing defects. Consequences of \u03b1S-lipid interaction include increased membrane tension, permeation by pore formation, membrane lysis and/or leakage due to the extraction of lipids from the bilayer. Moreover, we assert that the interaction of \u03b1S with a liquid-disordering phospholipid uniquely enriched in mitochondrial membranes, namely cardiolipin (1,3-diphosphatidyl-sn-glycerol, CL), helps target the \u03b1S oligomeric complexes intracellularly to mitochondria. Binding mediated by CL may thus represent an important pathomechanism by which cytosolic \u03b1S could physically associate with mitochondrial membranes and disrupt their integrity. Impaired mitochondrial function culminates in a cellular bioenergetic crisis and apoptotic death. To conclude, we advocate the accelerated discovery of new drugs targeting this pathway in order to restore mitochondrial function in PD.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine depletion in the putamen is associated with altered motor network functional connectivity in people with Parkinson's disease (PD), but the functional significance of these changes remains unclear, attributed to either pathological or compensatory mechanisms in different studies. Here, we examined the effects of PD on dorsal caudal putamen functional connectivity, off and on dopamine replacement therapy (DRT), using resting state fMRI. Motor performance was assessed with the Purdue pegboard task. Twenty-one patients with mild-moderate Parkinson's disease were studied twice, once after an overnight DRT washout and once after the administration of a standard dose of levodopa (Sinemet), and compared to 20 demographically-matched healthy control participants. PD patients off DRT showed increased putamen functional connectivity with both the cerebellum (lobule V) and primary motor cortex (M1), relative to healthy controls. Greater putamen-cerebellar functional connectivity was significantly correlated with better motor performance, whereas greater putamen-M1 functional connectivity was predictive of poorer motor performance. The administration of levodopa improved motor performance in the PD group, as expected, and reduced putamen-cerebellar connectivity to levels comparable to the healthy control group. The strength of putamen-cerebellar functional connectivity continued to predict motor performance in the PD group while on levodopa. These findings argue that increased putamen-M1 functional connectivity reflects a pathological change, deleterious to motor performance. In contrast, increased putamen-cerebellar connectivity reflects a compensatory mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is 1.5 times more frequent in men than women. Whether age modifies this ratio is unclear. We examined whether male-to-female (M-F) ratios change with age through a French nationwide prevalence/incidence study (2010) and a meta-analysis of incidence studies.\nWe used French national drug claims databases to identify PD cases using a validated algorithm. We computed M-F prevalence/incidence ratios overall and by age using Poisson regression. Ratios were regressed on age to estimate their annual change. We identified all PD incidence studies with age/sex-specific data, and performed a meta-analysis of M-F ratios.\nOn the basis of 149 672 prevalent (50% women) and 25 438 incident (49% women) cases, age-standardised rates were higher in men (prevalence=2.865/1000; incidence=0.490/1000 person-years) than women (prevalence=1.934/1000; incidence=0.328/1000 person-years). The overall M-F ratio was 1.48 for prevalence and 1.49 for incidence. Prevalence and incidence M-F ratios increased by 0.05 and 0.14, respectively, per 10 years of age. Incidence was similar in men and women under 50 years (M-F ratio <1.2, p>0.20), and over 1.6 (p<0.001) times higher in men than women above 80 years (p trend <0.001). A meta-analysis of 22 incidence studies (14 126 cases, 46% women) confirmed that M- F ratios increased with age (0.26 per 10 years, p trend=0.005).\nAge-increasing M-F ratios suggest that PD aetiology changes with age. Sex-related risk/protective factors may play a different role across the continuum of age at onset. This finding may inform aetiological PD research.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a risk factor for developing Parkinson disease (PD).\nThis nationwide population-based cohort study was based on data obtained from a dataset of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database for the period 2000 to 2010. A total of 49,967 patients with viral hepatitis were included for analysis. Furthermore, 199,868 people without viral hepatitis were included for comparisons. Patients with viral hepatitis were further grouped into 3 cohorts: hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HCV infection, and HBV-HCV coinfection. In each cohort, we calculated the incidence of developing PD. A Cox proportional hazards model was applied to estimate the risk of developing PD in terms of hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nThe crude HRs for developing PD was 0.66 (95% CI = 0.55-0.80) for HBV infection, 2.50 (95% CI = 2.07-3.02) for HCV infection, and 1.28 (95% CI = 0.88-1.85) for HBV-HCV coinfection. The association between HCV and PD remained statistically significant after adjustments for age, sex, and comorbidities (adjusted HR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.06-1.56).\nWe conducted a large nationwide population-based study and found that patients with HCV exhibit a significantly increased risk of developing PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, for which there is no effective treatment available till date. Here, we report the development of nonviral vectors specific for neuronal cells that can deliver short interfering RNA (siRNA) against the \u03b1-synuclein gene (SNCA), and prevent PD-like symptoms both in vitro and in vivo. These vectors not only help siRNA duplexes cross the blood-brain barrier in mice, but also stabilize these siRNAs leading to a sustainable 60-90% knockdown of \u03b1-synuclein protein. Mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine rapidly develop PD-like symptoms which were significantly alleviated when SNCA was knocked down using our vectors. Together, our data not only confirm the central role of \u03b1-synuclein in the onset of PD, but also provide a proof of principle that these nonviral vectors can be used as novel tools to design effective strategies to combat central nervous system diseases.",

    "abstract": "A typical feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) is pathological activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Here, we tested whether in patients with PD under dopaminergic treatment functional connectivity of the STN differs from healthy controls (HC) and whether some brain regions show (anti-) correlations between functional connectivity with STN and motor symptoms. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity with STN in 54 patients with PD and 55 HC matched for age, gender, and within-scanner motion. Compared to HC, we found attenuated negative STN-coupling with Crus I of the right cerebellum and with right ventromedial prefrontal regions in patients with PD. Furthermore, we observed enhanced negative STN-coupling with bilateral intraparietal sulcus/superior parietal cortex, right sensorimotor, right premotor, and left visual cortex compared to HC. Finally, we found a decline in positive STN-coupling with the left insula related to severity of motor symptoms and a decline of inter-hemispheric functional connectivity between left and right STN with progression of PD-related motor symptoms. Motor symptom related uncoupling of the insula, a key region in the saliency network and for executive function, from the STN might be associated with well-known executive dysfunction in PD. Moreover, uncoupling between insula and STN might also induce an insufficient setting of thresholds for the discrimination between relevant and irrelevant salient environmental stimuli, explaining observations of disturbed response control in PD. In sum, motor symptoms in PD are associated with a reduced coupling between STN and a key region for executive function.",

    "abstract": "Chronic treatment with oral levodopa is associated with an increased frequency of motor complications in the late stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). Continuous administration of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG-Duodopa(\u00ae), Abbott Laboratories), which has been available in Romania since 2009, represents an option for treating patients with advanced PD. Our primary objective was to report changes in motor complications after initiation of LCIG therapy. The secondary objectives were as follows: to determine the impact of LCIG therapy on the daily levodopa dose variation before/and after LCIG, to collect patient self-assessments of quality of life (QoL), and to study the overall tolerability and safety of LCIG administration. A retrospective analysis (2009-2013) of LCIG therapy and the experience in nine neurology centers in Romania was performed. The impact of LCIG therapy was evaluated by analyzing changes in motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and the patients' QoL after initiating therapy. The safety of LCIG therapy was estimated by noting agent-related adverse events (AEs) and medical device-related AEs. In the 113 patients included, we observed a significant improvement in PD symptoms after initiation of LCIG therapy. The \"on\" period increased, with a mean value of 6.14\u00a0h, and the dyskinesia period was reduced, with a mean value of 29.4\u00a0%. The quantified non-motor symptoms subsided. The patients exhibited significant improvements in QoL scores. There were few AEs and few cases of LCIG therapy discontinuation. LCIG is an important and available therapeutic option for managing patients with advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the most common age-dependent neurodegenerative movement disorder. Accumulated evidence indicates both environmental and genetic factors play important roles in PD pathogenesis, but the potential interaction between environment and genetics in PD etiology remains largely elusive. Here, we report that PD-related neurotoxins induce both expression and acetylation of multiple sites of histones in cultured human cells and mouse midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Consistently, levels of histone acetylation are markedly higher in midbrain DA neurons of PD patients compared to those of their matched control individuals. Further analysis reveals that multiple histone deacetylases (HDACs) are concurrently decreased in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-treated cells and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated mouse brains, as well as midbrain tissues of human PD patients. Finally, inhibition of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) protects, whereas inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC2 potentiates, MPP(+)-induced cell death. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of autophagy suppresses MPP(+)-induced HDACs degradation. The study reveals that PD environmental factors induce HDACs degradation and histone acetylation increase in DA neurons via autophagy and identifies an epigenetic mechanism in PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "To estimate the magnitude in which Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms and health- related quality of life (HRQoL) determined PD costs over a 4-year period.\nData collected during 3-month, each year, for 4 years, from the ELEP study, included sociodemographic, clinical and use of resources information. Costs were calculated yearly, as mean 3-month costs/patient and updated to Spanish \u20ac, 2012. Mixed linear models were performed to analyze total, direct and indirect costs based on symptoms and HRQoL.\nOne-hundred and seventy four patients were included. Mean (SD) age: 63 (11) years, mean (SD) disease duration: 8 (6) years. Ninety-three percent were HY I, II or III (mild or moderate disease). Forty-nine percent remained in the same stage during the study period. Clinical evaluation and HRQoL scales showed relatively slight changes over time, demonstrating a stable group overall. Mean (SD) PD total costs augmented 92.5%, from \u20ac 2,082.17 (\u20ac 2,889.86) in year 1 to \u20ac 4,008.6 (\u20ac 7,757.35) in year 4. Total, direct and indirect cost incremented 45.96%, 35.63%, and 69.69% for mild disease, respectively, whereas increased 166.52% for total, 55.68% for direct and 347.85% for indirect cost in patients with moderate PD. For severe patients, cost remained almost the same throughout the study. For each additional point in the SCOPA-Motor scale total costs increased \u20ac 75.72 (p = 0.0174); for each additional point on SCOPA-Motor and the SCOPA-COG, direct costs incremented \u20ac 49.21 (p = 0.0094) and \u20ac 44.81 (p = 0.0404), respectively; and for each extra point on the pain scale, indirect costs increased \u20ac 16.31 (p = 0.0228).\nPD is an expensive disease in Spain. Disease progression and severity as well as motor and cognitive dysfunctions are major drivers of costs increments. Therapeutic measures aimed at controlling progression and symptoms could help contain disease expenses.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience both motor output deficits and cognitive disabilities. Various PD rodent models have been developed to investigate the genetic and brain circuit-related causes of PD and have contributed to the basic and clinical research and to therapeutic strategies for this disease. Most studies using PD rodent models have focused on the motor output deficits, rather than cognitive disabilities due to the lack of appropriate testing tools that do not require significant motor abilities. In this study, we assessed the cognitive disabilities of PD model mice using a touch screen test that required only little motor ability. We found that the PD model mice, which had motor deficits caused by unilateral striatal dopaminergic degeneration, successfully underwent operant conditioning with a touch screen test. Additionally, we found that the PD model mice demonstrated impaired location discrimination, but intact attention and reversal learning in the cognitive tests. Therefore, the touch screen test is useful for assessing hidden cognitive disabilities in disease model animals with decreased motor function.",

    "abstract": "Our objective is to determine the value of enhanced substantia nigra echo in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease by analyzing the intensity and area of substantia nigra echo by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCS).\n36 patients diagnosed as ultra early stage Parkinson's disease between 2013 November and 2014 August were selected as the disease group, and 32 healthy people with the similar representation of age and gender were selected as the control group. TCS was used to detect the echo intensity and the echo intensity of the same location of bilateral hemicerebrum was used to evaluate the bilateral substantia nigra echo. The age and gender were also used for correlation analysis with the results of substantia nigra echo.\nIn the control group, there were 17 patients of substantia nigra echo grade I (53.1%), 13 cases of substantia nigra echo grade II (40.6%), 2 cases of substantia nigra echo grade III (6.3%). While in the disease group, there were 4 cases of substantia nigra echo grade II (11.1%), 13 cases of substantia nigra echo grade III (36.1%), 12 cases of substantia nigra echo grade IV (33.3%) and 7 cases of substantia nigra echo grade V (19.4%). The ratio of enhanced substantia nigra echo in Parkinson's disease patients was significantly higher than the control group. The analysis of the factors related to motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients revealed that the area of bilateral substantia nigra echo was negatively correlated with gender, but positively correlated with age, S/M ratio and UPDRS II score. However, there was no correlation with H-Y stage. The sensitivity of substantia nigra echo in diagnosing Parkinson's disease was 32/36=88.89% and the specificity was 30/32 = 93.75%.\nAnalysis of substantia nigra echo is practically useful for the diagnosis of the ultra early stage Parkinson's disease, which can potentially improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis to significantly enhance the early clinical prevention and reduce later disability.",

    "abstract": "To assess the imaging features of nigrosomes-1 in the substantia nigra through 3T MR susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) and its disease-specific changes for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nA total of 116 subjects were included in this study and allocated into 3 groups: 54 patients diagnosed with PD were assigned to the PD group, 51 age- and sex-matched volunteers without PD served as the control N-PD group, and 11 clinically suspected PD patients were allocated to the undiagnosed (UD) group. All patients received 3.0T superconducting MRI scanning on xxx. The images were analyzed and compared to assess the ability of nigrosomes-1 signals to depict PD pathology.\nThe signals of nigrosomes-1 were strong, droplet-like or oval in shape, and were found in 49 patients from the N-PD group (96.08%), on both sides of the SN (47 cases) and unilaterally (2 cases). In contrast, these signals were absent in all 54 cases from the PD group, and were undetected in 7 out of 11 cases in the UD group, 7 cases without the \"drop\" and 1 case with narrow strips of hyperintensity were clinically proven to PD, 2 cases with the typical hyperintensity were clinically proven to Parkinson's plus syndrome, 2 cases with slightly wider strip of hyperintensity were less sensitive to the drug levodopa.\nThe absence of typical droplet-like or oval-shaped nigrosomes-1 signals in 3.0T MR SWI may prove useful in identifying PD and Parkinson's syndrome with high sensitivity and specificity.",

    "abstract": "Power-based resistance training (PWT), using low load and high velocity, can improve physical function and quality of life in older persons. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), exhibiting muscular weakness and reduced movement speed, have been shown to be benefit from resistance training; however, little is known about the advantages of PWT for PD.\nTo evaluate the effects of PWT on bradykinesia and muscular performance in older patients with PD.\nTwenty-six patients with mild to moderate PD were randomly assigned to a PWT or control group (CON). The PWT program was three months, incorporating two sessions/wk of high-speed resistance training combined balance and agility drills. Outcome measures included: upper and lower limb bradykinesia scores, one repetition maximums (1RM) and peak powers on biceps curl, chest press, leg press, hip abduction and seated calf, and quality of life (PDQ-39).\nThe PWT group produced significant improvement in both upper and lower limbs bradykinesia scores, 1RM and muscle peak power (p < .05), which surpassed the CON group except for power during the seated calf exercise. No significant correlations between changes in clinical measure of bradykinesia and muscle peak power were observed after training. Significant improvements were seen in the PDQ-39 overall score, subsections for mobility, activities of daily living and social support for the PWT group.\nThe 3-month PWT program significantly reduced bradykinesia and increased muscle strength and power in older patients with PD. Power training is an effective training modality to improve physical function and quality of life for PD.",

    "abstract": "Waking up from sleep more than once to pass urine, known as nocturia, is an important nonmotor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Very little is known about the cause for nocturia. The aim of this work was to evaluate lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms in patients with PD reporting nocturia using standardized validated questionnaires and bladder diaries and to assess the impact of nocturia on quality of life and sleep.\nTwenty-three consecutive patients with PD (17 males, 6 females; mean age: 68.5 years; range, 50-85) referred to a specialist uro-neurology clinic reporting nocturia according to the International Continence Society definition were included. Patients measured their daily fluid intake, urinary output per void, and recorded these with the timing of voids on a 3-day bladder diary. Standardized questionnaires were used to assess LUT symptoms (Urinary Symptom Profile, International Prostate Symptom Score, and Qualiveen Short Form) and sleep quality (Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale).\nMean duration of PD was 10.1 years, and mean severity on H & Y scale was 3.0 (range, 1.0-5.0). Median duration of LUT symptoms was 6.0 years. Mean night-time urinary frequency was 3.5 (range, 1.0-7.3), and mean nocturnal maximum voided volume was 242 mL. Mean Nocturnal Polyuria Index (NPi) was 0.4 (range, 0.13-0.75), and 13 patients (56.5%) had nocturnal polyuria (NPi > 0.33). Patients with nocturnal polyuria reported more-severe LUT symptoms that impacted quality of life and sleep.\nIn this preliminary study, nocturnal polyuria seems to be common in patients with PD reporting nocturia and appears to affect quality of life and sleep, though this was not statistically significant. The bladder diary is an essential tool in the assessment of nocturia in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of possible cardiovascular risks from Parkinson's disease (PD) medications is critical to informing safe and effective treatment decisions. The objective of our study was to determine whether PD patients treated with nonergot dopamine agonists (DAs) are at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular outcomes, relative to PD patients receiving other treatments.\nMatched case-control studies were conducted within a cohort of 14,122 inpatients receiving treatment for PD who were identified in the Cerner Health Facts database. Primary outcomes were associations between nonergot DA use and diagnosis of adverse cardiovascular events (acute myocardial infarction, heart failure [HF], hypotension, and valvulopathy). Secondary outcomes included associations between nonergot DA use and diagnosis of adverse cerebrovascular events (cerebrovascular accident and ischemic stroke) and odds of significant exposure-outcome relationships by patient factors.\nHF was the only adverse event that demonstrated a significant association with nonergot DA use. Individuals treated with pramipexole were more likely to be diagnosed with HF, relative to no use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-1.53). The association between pramipexole and HF was greater among individuals treated with pramipexole monotherapy (relative to levodopa monotherapy) (AOR, 1.50; 95% CI: 1.09-2.06). Compared to nonusers, men and older individuals treated with pramipexole were more likely to be diagnosed with HF.\nResults from our study suggest an association between pramipexole use and HF. Findings warrant replication; however, individuals with PD and independent risk factors for, or a history of, HF may benefit from limited use of this drug.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease includes neuropsychiatric manifestations, such as depression, anxiety, apathy, psychosis, and impulse control disorders, which often are unreported by patients and caregivers or undetected by doctors. Given their substantial impact on patients and caregivers as well as the existence of effective therapies for some of these disorders, screening for neuropsychiatric symptoms is important. Instruments for screening have a particular methodology for validation, and their performance is expressed in terms of accuracy compared with formal diagnostic criteria. The present study reviews the attributes of the screening instruments applied for detection of the aforementioned major neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease. A quasi-systematic review (including predefined selection criteria, but not evaluating the quality of the reviewed studies) was carried out on the basis of previous systematic reviews (commissioned by the American Academy of Neurology and the Movement Disorder Society) and made current by conducting a literature search (2005-2014). For depression, 11 scales and questionnaires were shown to be valid for Parkinson's disease screening. The recently developed Parkinson Anxiety Scale and the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory demonstrate satisfactory properties as screening instruments for anxiety, and the Lille Apathy Rating Scale for detection of apathy. No scale adequately screens for psychosis, so a specific psychosis instrument should be developed. The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease (Questionnaire and Rating Scale) are valid for comprehensive screening of impulse control disorders, and the Parkinson's Disease-Sexual Addiction Screening Test for hypersexuality specifically.",

    "abstract": "Almost 30 years after the start of the modern era of deep brain stimulation (DBS), the subthalamic nucleus (STN) still constitutes a standard stimulation target for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), but the use of STN-DBS is also now supported by level I clinical evidence for treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Disruption of neural synchronization in the STN has been suggested as one of the possible mechanisms of action of standard and alternative patterns of STN-DBS at a local level. Meanwhile, recent experimental and computational modeling evidence has signified the efficiency of alternative patterns of stimulation; however, no indications exist for treatment-refractory OCD. Here, we comparatively simulate the desynchronizing effect of standard (regular at 130 Hz) versus temporally alternative (in terms of frequency, temporal variability and the existence of bursts or pauses) patterns of STN-DBS for PD and OCD, by means of a stochastic dynamical model and two microelectrode recording (MER) datasets.\nThe stochastic model is fitted to subthalamic MERs acquired during eight surgical interventions for PD and eight surgical interventions for OCD. For each dynamical system simulated, we comparatively assess the invariant density (steady-state phase distribution) as a measure inversely related to the desynchronizing effect yielded by the applied patterns of stimulation.\nWe demonstrate that high (130 Hz)-and low (80 Hz)-frequency irregular patterns of stimulation, and low-frequency periodic stimulation interrupted by bursts of pulses, yield in both pathologic conditions a significantly stronger desynchronizing effect compared with standard STN-DBS, and distinct alternative patterns of stimulation. In PD, values of the invariant density measure are proven to be optimal at the dorsolateral oscillatory region of the STN including sites with the optimal therapeutic window.\nIn addition to providing novel insights into the efficiency of low-frequency nonregular patterns of STN-DBS for advanced PD and treatment-refractory OCD, this work points to a possible correlation of a model-based outcome measure with clinical effectiveness of stimulation and may have significant implications for an energy- and therapeutically-efficient configuration of a closed-loop neuromodulation system.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease has multiple determinants and is associated with a wide range of exposures that appear to modify risk in traditional observational studies, including numerous lifestyle and environmental factors. Across other fields of medicine, Mendelian randomization has emerged as a powerful method to examine whether associations between exposures and disease outcomes are causal. Here we discuss the concept of Mendelian randomization, its potential relevance to Parkinson's disease, and suggest avenues through which the method could be employed to further understanding of the causal basis of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Proteostasis are integrated biological pathways within cells that control synthesis, folding, trafficking and degradation of proteins. The absence of cell division makes brain proteostasis susceptible to age-related changes and neurodegeneration. Two key processes involved in sustaining normal brain proteostasis are the unfolded protein response and autophagy. Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and prion diseases (PrDs) have different clinical manifestations of neurodegeneration, however, all share an accumulation of misfolded pathological proteins associated with perturbations in unfolded protein response and macroautophagy. While both the unfolded protein response and macroautophagy play an important role in the prevention and attenuation of AD and PD progression, only macroautophagy seems to play an important role in the development of PrDs. Macroautophagy and unfolded protein response can be modulated by pharmacological interventions. However, further research is necessary to better understand the regulatory pathways of both processes in health and neurodegeneration to be able to develop new therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "In this randomized controlled study we analyse and compare the acute and chronic effects of visual and acoustic cues on gait performance in Parkinson's Disease (PD). We enrolled 46 patients with idiopathic PD who were assigned to 3 different modalities of gait training: (1) use of acoustic cues, (2) use of visual cues, or (3) overground training without cues. All patients were tested with kinematic analysis of gait at baseline (T0), at the end of the 4-week rehabilitation programme (T1), and 3 months later (T2). Regarding the acute effect, acoustic cues increased stride length and stride duration, while visual cues reduced the number of strides and normalized the stride/stance distribution but also reduced gait speed. As regards the chronic effect of cues, we recorded an improvement in some gait parameters in all 3 groups of patients: all 3 types of training improved gait speed; visual cues also normalized the stance/swing ratio, acoustic cues reduced the number of strides and increased stride length, and overground training improved stride length. The changes were not retained at T2 in any of the experimental groups. Our findings support and characterize the usefulness of cueing strategies in the rehabilitation of gait in PD.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the influence of motor symptom asymmetry in Parkinson's disease (PD) on Grooved Pegboard (GP) performance in right-handed participants. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale was used to assess motor symptoms and separate participants with PD into two groups (right-arm affected, left-arm affected) for comparison with a group of healthy older adults. Participants completed the place and replace GP tasks two times with both hands. Laterality quotients were computed to quantify performance differences between the two hands. Comparisons among the three groups indicated that when the nonpreferred hand is affected by PD motor symptoms, superior preferred hand performance (as seen in healthy older adults) is further exaggerated in tasks that require precision (i.e., place task). Regardless of the task, when the preferred hand is affected, there is an evident shift to superior left-hand performance, which may inevitably manifest as a switch in hand preference. Results add to the discussion of the relationship between handedness and motor symptom asymmetry in PD.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FoG) is a common and debilitating condition in Parkinson's disease (PD) associated with executive dysfunction. A subtype of FoG does not respond to dopaminergic therapy and may be related to noradrenergic deficiency. This pilot study explores the effects of atomoxetine on gait in PD patients with dopa-unresponsive FoG using a novel paradigm for objective gait assessment.\nTen patients with PD and dopa-unresponsive FoG were enrolled in this eight-week open label pilot study. Assessments included an exploratory gait analysis protocol that quantified spatiotemporal parameters during straight-away walking and turning, while performing a dual task. Clinical, and subjective assessments of gait, quality of life, and safety were also administered. The primary outcome was a validated subjective assessment for FoG (FOG-Q). Atomoxetine was well tolerated, however, no significant change was observed in the primary outcome. The gait analysis protocol correlated well with clinical scales, but not with subjective assessments. DBS patients were more likely to increase gait velocity (p\u2009=\u20090.033), and improved in other clinical assessments.\nObjective gait analysis protocols assessing gait while dual tasking are feasible and useful for this patient population, and may be superior correlates of FoG severity than subjective measures. These findings can inform future trials in this population.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is well documented to be associated with elevated systemic oxidative stress and perceptual impairments. Furthermore, the striatum and extrastriatal cortical areas, which are involved in the coordination of perceptual functions, are impaired at an early stage of the disease. However, the possible pathophysiology involved in perceptual impairments remains unclear. This raises the possibility that structural abnormalities might mediate the relationship between oxidative stress and perceptual impairments.\nWe explored the differences between 27 patients with PD and 25 healthy controls in terms of serum oxidative stress, perceptual functions, and regional gray matter. A single-level three-variable mediation model was used to investigate the possible relationships between serum oxidative stress, regional gray matter volume, and different domains of perceptual functioning.\nThe results demonstrate that increased serum oxidative stress (as indicated by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) was associated with declined perceptual functioning in PD patients. We further explored significant gray matter volume reductions in the bilateral temporal gyri (middle temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus), bilateral frontal gyri, limbic lobe (hippocampus and uncus), left inferior parietal lobule, right caudate nucleus, and insula in PD. Further mediation analysis showed that gray matter volumes in the middle temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, hippocampus, and insula served as brain mediators between elevated serum oxidative stress and perceptual impairments.\nThese results suggest that higher oxidative stress levels adversely impact perceptual functions by causing temporal and mesolimbic abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in \u03b2-glucocerebrosidase (encoded by GBA1) cause Gaucher disease (GD), a lysosomal storage disorder, and increase the risk of developing Parkinson disease (PD). The pathogenetic relationship between the two disorders is unclear. Here, we characterised Ca(2+) release in fibroblasts from type I GD and PD patients together with age-matched, asymptomatic carriers, all with the common N370S mutation in \u03b2-glucocerebrosidase. We show that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) release was potentiated in GD and PD patient fibroblasts but not in cells from asymptomatic carriers. ER Ca(2+) signalling was also potentiated in fibroblasts from aged healthy subjects relative to younger individuals but not further increased in aged PD patient cells. Chemical or molecular inhibition of \u03b2-glucocerebrosidase in fibroblasts and a neuronal cell line did not affect ER Ca(2+) signalling suggesting defects are independent of enzymatic activity loss. Conversely, lysosomal Ca(2+) store content was reduced in PD fibroblasts and associated with age-dependent alterations in lysosomal morphology. Accelerated remodelling of Ca(2+) stores by pathogenic GBA1 mutations may therefore feature in PD.",

    "abstract": "Purpose To explore the utility of nigrosome 1 with 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to differentiate idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD) from drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP). Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this study, and participants gave informed consent. This study enrolled patients with DIP (n = 20) and IPD (n = 29) who underwent N-3-fluoropropyl-2-\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3-\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane ((18)F-FP-CIT) positron emission tomography (PET) and healthy participants (n = 20). All participants underwent 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 1.0 mm(3) oblique axial three-dimensional multiecho-data image combination imaging to view the nigrosome 1 with 3-T imaging. Two reviewers independently assessed the nigrosome 1 without clinical information. DIP was diagnosed when no abnormality was seen at (18)F-FP-CIT PET. Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the nigrosome 1 imaging were evaluated between the IPD and DIP patients and between the IPD patients and healthy participants. Interrater agreement was assessed with Cohen \u03ba. Results Both reviewers agreed in 63 of 69 participants (91.3%) for the presence of any abnormality on either side of the nigrosome 1 (\u03ba = 0.825). Findings in all 29 IPD patients (100%) and three of 20 DIP patients (15%) were rated as abnormal and in 17 of 20 DIP patients (85%) they were interpreted as normal on the basis of imaging of the nitgrosome 1 (sensitivity, 100% (29 of 29); specificity, 85.0% (17 of 20); accuracy, 93.9% (46 of 49) between IPD and DIP patients). Findings in 3 of 20 healthy participants (15.0%) were interpreted as abnormal on the basis of imaging the nigrosome 1 while in the other 17 of 20 healthy participants (85.0%) they were rated as normal (sensitivity, 100% [29 of 29]; specificity, 85.0% [17 of 20]; accuracy, 93.9% [46 of 49] between IPD patients and healthy participants [\u03ba = 0.831]). Conclusion The imaging of nigrosome 1 with 3-T imaging can differentiate DIP from IPD with high accuracy and may help to screen patients who need dopamine transporter imaging in those suspected of having DIP.

    "abstract": "A growing body of literature supports the view that essential tremor (ET) involves alteration of cerebellar-thalamo-cortical networks which can result in working memory and executive deficits. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that individuals with ET would exhibit worse performance on memory tasks requiring more intrinsic organization and structuring (i.e., word lists) relative to those with fewer 'executive' demands (i.e., stories), similar to that previously observed in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nParticipants included a convenience sample of 68 ET patients and 68 idiopathic PD patients, retrospectively matched based on age, education, and sex. All patients underwent routine neuropsychological evaluation assessing recent memory, auditory attention/working memory, language, and executive function. Memory measures included the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-R and WMS-III Logical Memory.\nBoth ET and PD patients performed significantly worse on word list than story memory recall tasks. The magnitude of the difference between these two memory tasks was similar for ET and PD patients. In both patient groups, performance on measures of executive function and auditory attention/working memory was not distinctly correlated with word list vs. story recall.\nThese findings suggest that frontal-executive dysfunction in both ET and PD may negatively influence performance on memory tests that are not inherently organized. Although the pathophysiology of these two 'movement disorders' are quite distinct, both have downstream effects on thalamo-frontal circuitry which may provide a common pathway for a similar memory phenotype. Findings are discussed in terms of neuroimaging evidence, conceptual models, and best practice.",

    "abstract": "Background. Parkinson's disease (PD) negatively affects the quality of life. There is limited information on PD published from Africa. Lack of adequate knowledge poses a barrier in the provision of appropriate treatment and care for individuals with PD. Methods. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in urban and rural Mukono district, central Uganda. Through the systematic sampling method, data were gathered from 377 adult participants, interviewed on selected aspects of PD knowledge and attitudes. Results. Of the 377 participants, 47% were from urban settings and 68% (260/377) were women with a median age (IQR) of 34 (26-48) years. Half of the study respondents did not know the body part involved in or apparent cause of PD. Nearly 1/3 of individuals believed that PD is a form of insanity and 17% believed that PD is contagious. Rural dwellers were more likely to have incorrect knowledge regarding selected aspects of PD. Conclusions. Understanding the cause of PD is very limited in our setting. Some beliefs about PD aetiology may potentially worsen stigma and social isolation. This study highlights the need for increasing PD awareness in our settings. Public health approaches that improve knowledge are urgently needed to promote care access and community response to Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Enhancements in motor performance have been demonstrated in response to intense stimuli both in healthy subjects and in the form of 'paradoxical kinesis' in patients with Parkinson's disease. Here we identify a mid-latency evoked potential in local field potential recordings from the region of the subthalamic nucleus, which scales in amplitude with both the intensity of the stimulus delivered and corresponding enhancements in biomechanical measures of maximal handgrips, independent of the dopaminergic state of our subjects with Parkinson's disease. Recordings of a similar evoked potential in the related pedunculopontine nucleus - a key component of the reticular activating system - provide support for this neural signature in the subthalmic nucleus being a novel correlate of ascending arousal, propagated from the reticular activating system to exert an 'energizing' influence on motor circuitry. Future manipulation of this system linking arousal and motor performance may provide a novel approach for the non-dopaminergic enhancement of motor performance in patients with hypokinetic disorders such as Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have identified several loci associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Whole-exome sequencing detects rare coding variants, but their links with PD genome-wide association study loci are unknown. Our objective was to investigate whether nonsynonymous variants in LRRK2 can explain associations at the PD-associated locus tagged by rs1994090.\nWe sequenced all coding exons of LRRK2 in 453 East Asian samples and evaluated linkage disequilibrium between each nonsynonymous variant and rs1994090. We then tested selected variants and haplotypes for association with PD in 13,581 East Asian samples.\nOf all the nonsynonymous variants, only p.Gly2385Arg was in moderate linkage disequilibrium with rs1994090 and was observed on haplotypes tagged by the rs1994090-C risk allele. Conditional analyses showed that associations at these 2 variants are not independent.\nLRRK2 p.Gly2385Arg can explain most if not all of the PD association at rs1994090 in East Asians, but other nonsynonymous variants are independent. \u00a9 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to study motor and nonmotor symptoms and striatal dopaminergic denervation, as well as the relationship between them, in a cohort of asymptomatic relatives of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with the R1441G-leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 mutation.\nAsymptomatic relatives of patients with PD and this mutation were tested for the presence of the mutation and evaluated for striatal, putamenal, and caudate dopaminergic transporters using (123)I-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane single-photon emission computed tomography binding ratios. Clinical and neuropsychological evaluations including timed motor tests, a smell identification test, and global cognition, attention, executive, visuospatial, and memory functions as well as depression, constipation, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder were also assessed.\nTwenty-seven carriers and 19 noncarriers were studied. Compared with noncarriers, mutation carriers had significantly lower (123)I-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropan mean striatal (P\u2009=\u20090.03), mean putamenal (P\u2009=\u20090.01), and lowest putamenal (P\u2009=\u20090.01) binding ratios. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the carrier status and the execution of timed tests significantly predicted striatal (123)I-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane binding. The proportion of variation accounted for by the regression model of these variables was 69% for the putamen and 53% for the caudate nucleus.\nAsymptomatic carriers of the R1441G-leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 mutation have evidence of dopaminergic nigrostriatal denervation, mainly in the putamen, which is associated with a decline in the execution of complex motor tests. These tests could be early indicators of the ongoing dopaminergic deficit in this group at risk of PD.",

    "abstract": "Gastric and colonic alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity has been reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, enteric alpha-synuclein also has been reported in healthy individuals.\nWe aimed to investigate the utility of alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity from gastric and colonic mucosal tissues obtained by routine endoscopy to detect PD, and to correlate the pathological burden of alpha-synuclein with motor and nonmotor features of PD.\nWe recruited 104 study subjects, consisting of 38 patients with PD, 13 patients with probable multiple system atrophy (MSA), and 53 healthy controls. Gastric and colonic mucosal tissues obtained by endoscopic gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were assessed using alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry. Detailed motor and nonmotor features of PD were correlated with enteric alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity.\nNo difference was seen in the enteric \u03b1-SYN immunoreactivity among patients with PD (31.6% for stomach and 10.4% for colon), patients with MSA (40.0% for stomach and 8.0% for colon), and healthy controls (33.3% for stomach and 18.5% for colon). The frequency of positive alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity was higher in gastric biopsy tissues than in colonic biopsy tissues in all of the study groups (P\u2009<\u20090.05). No significant correlation was found between the presence of alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity and the motor and nonmotor features of PD.\nThe presence of alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in gastric and colonic mucosa was detected in a similar manner in patients with PD, patients with MSA, and controls, thus suggesting a limited role of enteric mucosal alpha-synuclein as a diagnostic biomarker for PD. Future studies are warranted to detect pathological alpha-synuclein strains.",

    "abstract": "Many patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) are reluctant to undergo the subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) when surgery is warranted. Reasons for this reluctance have not been examined. We undertook to establish the rate and causes of this reluctance for STN-DBS in patients with advanced PD.\nA reluctant group was defined as patients who were hesitant to undergo DBS. Clinical information included age, onset age, disease duration, the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr stage and levodopa equivalent dose when they were evaluated with a view to consider surgery.\nWe enrolled 186 patients who underwent STN-DBS. 84 patients (45%) belonged to the reluctant group. Between the reluctant and the non-reluctant, there were no differences in preoperative characteristics. Main reasons for hesitation were fear of complications (74%) and economic burden (50%). The main reasons that they finally underwent the DBS were confidence in the doctor's decision (80%) and encouragement from their family (36%).\nBuilding trust between patients and physicians is an important factor in guiding patients to undergo this treatment. To reduce the reluctance to undergo DBS at the appropriate time, we need to find effective ways of reducing their psychological and economic burden.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work was to construct a model for anxiety in PD and compare the relative contributions of PD-specific and -nonspecific general population risk factors for anxiety in this model.\nStructural equation modeling of associations of risk factors with the anxiety outcome using a cross-sectional data set of 342 patients with PD were used.\nA model with acceptable to good fit was generated that explained 65% of the variance in anxiety scores. A previous history of depression and the severity of the depressive symptoms scored on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were the only nonspecific variables with a direct effect on anxiety. The presence of motor fluctuations and disease-related decline in activities of daily living were PD-specific markers of anxiety. Nonspecific risk factors had a greater influence in the model than PD-specific risk factors. Standardized regression coefficients suggested that the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was the most important contributor to the variation in anxiety. A post-hoc analysis showed that the effects of the following variables on anxiety levels were fully mediated by depression: sex; family history of depression; previous history of anxiety; cognitive status; difficulties in non-disease-specific activities of daily living; and severity of motor signs.\nIn this cross-sectional study, we showed that nonspecific general population risk factors are more important markers for anxiety than PD-specific risk factors. Depression was the most prominent marker. PD-specific markers for anxiety appear to be more situational and related to off periods and disease-specific disturbances of activities of daily living.",

The experimental data of dynamic CA assessment from the ANS Laboratory of CCGH was accessed for further processing and analysis. The subjects were classified into the groups of healthy and with Parkinson's disease. Based on the accessed ventilation and CBF data, the percentage changes in ventilation and CBF responses to PETCO2 were examined. To minimize effects of changes in ABP on cerebral vasomotor reactivity (CVMR) estimation, cerebrovascular conductance index (CVCi) was calculated, and CBFV-PETCO2 and CVCi-PETCO2 relationships were quantified by nonlinear logistic regression. The interaction between ventilation responses and CBF autoregulation will be modeled and parameters will be validated.",

    "abstract": "Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) demarks cognitive decline after major surgery but has been studied to date in \"healthy\" adults. Although individuals with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) commonly undergo elective surgery, these individuals have yet to be prospectively followed despite hypotheses of increased POCD risk.\nTo conduct a pilot study examining cognitive change pre-post elective orthopedic surgery for PD relative to surgery and non-surgery peers.\nA prospective one-year longitudinal design. No-dementia idiopathic PD individuals were actively recruited along with non-PD \"healthy\" controls (HC) undergoing knee replacement surgery. Non-surgical PD and HC controls were also recruited. Attention/processing speed, inhibitory function, memory recall, animal (semantic) fluency, and motor speed were assessed at baseline (pre-surgery), 3 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year post- orthopedic surgery. Reliable change methods examined individual changes for PD individuals relative to control surgery and control non-surgery peers.\nOver two years we screened 152 older adult surgery or non-surgery candidates with 19 of these individuals having a diagnosis of PD. Final participants included 8 PD (5 surgery, 3 non-surgery), 47 Control Surgery, and 21 Control Non-Surgery. Eighty percent (4 of the 5) PD surgery declined greater than 1.645 standard deviations from their baseline performance on measures assessing processing speed and inhibitory function. This was not observed for the non-surgery PD individuals.\nThis prospective pilot study demonstrated rationale and feasibility for examining cognitive decline in at-risk neurodegenerative populations. We discuss recruitment and design challenges for examining post-operative cognitive decline in neurodegenerative samples.",

    "abstract": "Impaired dual-task performance significantly impacts upon functional mobility in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this study was to identify determinants of dual-task performance in people with PD in three different dual tasks to assess their possible task-dependency.\nWe recruited 121 home-dwelling patients with PD (mean age 65.93 years; mean disease duration 8.67 years) whom we subjected to regular walking (control condition) and to three dual-task conditions: walking combined with a backwards Digit Span task, an auditory Stroop task and a Mobile Phone task. We measured dual-task gait velocity using the GAITRite mat and dual-task reaction times and errors on the concurrent tasks as outcomes. Motor, cognitive and descriptive variables which correlated to dual-task performance (p < 0.20) were entered into a stepwise forward multiple linear regression model.\nSingle-task gait velocity and executive function, tested by the alternating intake test, was significantly associated with gait velocity during the Digit Span (R(2) = 0.65; p < 0.001), the Stroop (R(2) = 0.73; p < 0.001) and the Mobile Phone task (R(2) = 0.62; p < 0.001). In addition, disease severity proved correlated to gait velocity during the Stroop task. Age was a surplus determinant of gait velocity while using a mobile phone.\nSingle-task gait velocity and executive function as measured by a verbal fluency switching task were independent determinants of dual-task gait performance in people with PD. In contrast to expectation, these factors were the same across different tasks, supporting the robustness of the findings. Future study needs to determine whether these factors predict dual-task abnormalities prospectively.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is disabling in Parkinson disease. It is often associated with other non-motor symptoms, but little is known about its underlying pathophysiology.\nTo investigate neuroimaging (using dopaminergic and cholinergic PET) and clinical factors associated with fatigue severity in PD.\n133 PD subjects (96M/37F) completed the Fatigue Severity Scale, Movement Disorders Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), Hoehn-Yahr staging, validated scales for depression, anxiety, apathy, sleep, and cognition, and underwent [(11)C]methyl-4-piperidinyl propionate (PMP) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and [(11)C]dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) monoaminergic PET imaging. We explored contributions to PD fatigue using separate regression models based either on neuroimaging parameters or clinicometric scales.\nIn a neuroimaging regression model, neither striatal DTBZ uptake nor AChE PMP uptake were predictors of fatigue in PD. In a post-hoc neuroimaging regression model, stratifying the total cohort into mild vs. moderate-to-severe PD, striatal DTBZ uptake was a significant predictor of fatigue in mild but not moderate-to-severe PD. In a clinicometric regression model, higher Beck Depression Inventory-somatic subscore, higher levodopa dose equivalents and younger age were all significant predictors of fatigue in PD, but the MDS-UPDRS non-motor experiences of daily living score was the best predictor overall.\nCholinergic uptake was not a predictor of fatigue in PD, but nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation predicted fatigue in mild disease. Total non-motor symptom burden, somatic affective symptoms, levodopa dose equivalents, and younger age were independent clinical predictors of fatigue.",

    "abstract": "Nocturnal hypokinesia/akinesia is a distressing symptom in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is difficult to accurately monitor these symptoms based on clinical interviews alone.\nTo quantitatively compare nocturnal movements of PD patients with their spouses by using multisite inertial sensors and to correlate these parameters with disease severity scores.\nNocturnal movements in 19 PD couples (mild-moderate stage) were assessed and compared using wearable sensors (limbs and trunk) for one night at their homes. Nocturnal parameters included number, velocity, acceleration, degree, and duration of rolling over, number of getting out of bed, and limb movements. Each activity was compared to sleep diary, and video recording for accuracy.\nPD patients significantly had fewer rolling over (p = 0.048), turned with smaller degree (p = 0.007), less velocity (p = 0.011), and acceleration (p < 0.001), but had more episodes of getting out of bed (p = 0.03, nocturia) when compared to their spouses. Moderate and significant correlations were observed between the mean duration of rolling over and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-Axial score, and Nocturnal Akinesia Dystonia and Cramp Score. The number of leg movements (predominant side) significantly correlated with REM behavior disorder single-question screen. Episodes of nocturia correlated with total and bedtime levodopa equivalent dose. Several other correlations were also observed.\nOur study was able to demonstrate quantitatively the presence of nocturnal hypokinesia in PD patients. This problem correlated with daytime axial motor and nonmotor symptoms. Treatment strategy for PD should be based on a comprehensive review of both day- and nighttime symptoms.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease, an increase in beta oscillations within the basal ganglia nuclei has been shown to be associated with difficulty in movement initiation. An important role in the generation of these oscillations is thought to be played by the motor cortex and by a network composed of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the external segment of globus pallidus (GPe). Several alternative models have been proposed to describe the mechanisms for generation of the Parkinsonian beta oscillations. However, a recent experimental study of Tachibana and colleagues yielded results which are challenging for all published computational models of beta generation. That study investigated how the presence of beta oscillations in a primate model of Parkinson's disease is affected by blocking different connections of the STN-GPe circuit. Due to a large number of experimental conditions, the study provides strong constraints that any mechanistic model of beta generation should satisfy. In this paper we present two models consistent with the data of Tachibana et al. The first model assumes that Parkinsonian beta oscillation are generated in the cortex and the STN-GPe circuits resonates at this frequency. The second model additionally assumes that the feedback from STN-GPe circuit to cortex is important for maintaining the oscillations in the network. Predictions are made about experimental evidence that is required to differentiate between the two models, both of which are able to reproduce firing rates, oscillation frequency and effects of lesions carried out by Tachibana and colleagues. Furthermore, an analysis of the models reveals how the amplitude and frequency of the generated oscillations depend on parameters.",

    "abstract": "Melanoma incidence is higher in patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) and vice versa, but the genetic link shared by both diseases is unknown. As PARK2 is both a tumor suppressor gene and frequently mutated in young onset PD, we evaluated the role of PARK2 in melanoma predisposition and progression.\nAn in-depth PARK2 gene dosage analysis and sequencing was performed on 512 French case patients and 562 healthy control patients, as well as sporadic tumors and melanoma cell lines. The frequency of genetic alterations was compared between case patients and control patients using two-sided Fisher's exact tests and odds ratio (OR) calculations. We used western blotting to determine PARKIN expression in melanocytes and melanoma cell lines and transfection followed by clonogenic assays to evaluate the effect of PARKIN expression on cellular proliferation. All statistical tests were two-sided.\nGermline PARK2 mutations (including copy number variations, splicing, and putative deleterious missense mutations) were present in 25 case patients but only four control patients (OR = 3.95, 95% confidence interval = 1.34 to 15.75). Copy number variations (CNVs) and loss of heterozygosity were present in 60% and 74%, respectively, of primary tumors. PARKIN protein was expressed in melanocytes but not in most melanoma cell lines, and its expression decreased following melanocyte transformation by oncogenic NRAS. Re-expression of PARKIN in melanoma cell lines resulted in a drastic reduction of cell proliferation and inhibition of PARKIN in melanocytes stimulated their proliferation.\nOur results show an important role for PARK2 as a tumor suppressor both in melanoma predisposition and progression, which could explain the epidemiological association of these diseases.",

Copy number variations (CNVs) and loss of heterozygosity were present in 60% and 74%, respectively, of primary tumors. PARKIN protein was expressed in melanocytes but not in most melanoma cell lines, and its expression decreased following melanocyte transformation by oncogenic NRAS. Re-expression of PARKIN in melanoma cell lines resulted in a drastic reduction of cell proliferation and inhibition of PARKIN in melanocytes stimulated their proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Deposition of \u03b1-synuclein and neuroinflammation are key pathological features of Parkinson's disease (PD). There is no cure for the disease; however, targeting the pathological features might be available to modulate the disease onset and progression. Hypoestoxide (HE) has been demonstrated as a NF-\u03baB modulator, thereby acting as a potential anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer drug.\nIn order to assess the effect of HE in a mouse model of PD, mThy1-\u03b1-syn transgenic mice received intraperitoneal (IP) injections of either vehicle or HE (5\u00a0mg/kg) daily for 4\u00a0weeks.\nTreatment of HE decreased microgliosis, astrogliosis, and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in \u03b1-syn transgenic mice. HE administration also prevented the loss of dopaminergic neurons and ameliorated motor behavioral deficits in the \u03b1-syn transgenic mice, and \u03b1-synuclein pathology was significantly reduced by treatment of HE. In addition, increased levels of nuclear phosphorylated NF-\u03baB in the frontal cortex of \u03b1-syn transgenic mice were significantly reduced by HE administration.\nThese results support the therapeutic potential of HE for PD and other \u03b1-synuclein-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Pisa Syndrome (PS) is a real clinical enigma, and its management remains a challenge. In order to improve the knowledge about resting state and during maximal voluntary muscle contraction (MVMC) of the axial muscles, we described the electromyography results of paraspinal muscles, rectus abdominis, external oblique, and quadratus lumborum of both sides of 60 patients. Electromyography was assessed at rest, during MVMC while bending in the opposite direction of the PS and during MVMC while bending in the direction of the PS. The MVMC gave information about the interferential pattern (INT) or subinterferential pattern (sub-INT). We defined asymmetrical activation (AA) when a sub-INT was detected on the muscle on the side opposite to the PS bending and an INT of same muscle in the direction of PS bending. We observed significant AA during MVMC only in the external oblique muscles in 78% of the subjects. Our results of asymmetric ability to generate maximal voluntary force of the external oblique muscles support a central dissynchronisation of axial muscles as a significant contributor for the bending of the spine in erect position. These results could have important implication to physiotherapy and the use of botulinum toxin in the treatment of PS.",

    "abstract": "Recently, an intrinsic fractal harmonic structure was found underlying the rhythm of physiological walking, but it has not yet been investigated in subjects with a neurological disease. The aim of this study was to determine if and how this harmonic structure is altered in patients with Parkinson's Disease.\nGait analysis of 70 patients with Parkinson's Disease in pharmacological phase on was performed, the findings of which we compared with reference data of age-matched healthy subjects. Fifteen patients were retested after a washout period of 12 h.\nAlterations in all spatio-temporal gait parameters and gait indices with regard to symmetry, coordination, and harmony were noted, but after correction for multicollinearity bias, only the latter correlated significantly with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score (p=0.001). The fractal gait structure underwent even more extensive alterations in pharmacological off phase (p<0.05).\nThe intrinsic gait harmony was altered in patients with Parkinson's Disease and significantly correlated to motor severity. It could be partially recovered by assumption of L-dopa.\nLoss of harmony is a quantitatively assessable gait benchmark in Parkinson's Disease. It seems to be dependent on dopaminergic but also on non-dopaminergic networks.",

The whole brain gray- and white-matter changes were analyzed and the central ascending cholinergic pathway involving the pedunculopontine nucleus and thalamus was compared with a region-of-interest analysis and probabilistic tractography.\nThe PDRBD+ group showed decreased gray matter volume of the left posterior cingulate and hippocampus compared to the PDRBD- and additional gray matter decrease in the left precuneus, cuneus, medial frontal gyrus, postcentral gyrus and both inferior parietal lobule compared to the HC group (uncorrected p < 0.001, k = 50). There were no significant differences in white matter changes between the PDRBD- and PDRBD+ groups both by fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivities. However, both PD groups showed widespread changes by fractional anisotropy reductions and mean diffusivity increments compared to HC (p < 0.05 corrected). There were no significant differences in tract-based spatial statistics and the normalized tract volumes as well as the diffusion indices of both the thalamus and pedunculopontine nuclei among the study groups.\nThe appearance of RBD in PD may be related to regional gray matter changes in the left posterior cingulate and hippocampus but not localized to the brainstem.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is arguably the most severe symptom associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), and often occurs while performing dual tasks or approaching narrowed and cluttered spaces. While it is well known that visual cues alleviate FOG, it is not clear if this effect may be the result of cognitive or sensorimotor mechanisms. Nevertheless, the role of vision may be a critical link that might allow us to disentangle this question. Gaze behaviour has yet to be carefully investigated while freezers approach narrow spaces, thus the overall objective of this study was to explore the interaction between cognitive and sensory-perceptual influences on FOG. In experiment #1, if cognitive load is the underlying factor leading to FOG, then one might expect that a dual-task would elicit FOG episodes even in the presence of visual cues, since the load on attention would interfere with utilization of visual cues. Alternatively, if visual cues alleviate gait despite performance of a dual-task, then it may be more probable that sensory mechanisms are at play. In compliment to this, the aim of experiment#2 was to further challenge the sensory systems, by removing vision of the lower-limbs and thereby forcing participants to rely on other forms of sensory feedback rather than vision while walking toward the narrow space. Spatiotemporal aspects of gait, percentage of gaze fixation frequency and duration, as well as skin conductance levels were measured in freezers and non-freezers across both experiments. Results from experiment#1 indicated that although freezers and non-freezers both walked with worse gait while performing the dual-task, in freezers, gait was relieved by visual cues regardless of whether the cognitive demands of the dual-task were present. At baseline and while dual-tasking, freezers demonstrated a gaze behaviour that neglected the doorway and instead focused primarily on the pathway, a strategy that non-freezers adopted only when performing the dual-task. Interestingly, with the combination of visual cues and dual-task, freezers increased the frequency and duration of fixations toward the doorway, compared to non-freezers. These results suggest that although increasing demand on attention does significantly deteriorate gait in freezers, an increase in cognitive demand is not exclusively responsible for freezing (since visual cues were able to overcome any interference elicited by the dual-task). When vision of the lower limbs was removed in experiment#2, only the freezers' gait was affected. However, when visual cues were present, freezers' gait improved regardless of the dual-task. This gait behaviour was accompanied by greater amount of time spent looking at the visual cues irrespective of the dual-task. Since removing vision of the lower-limbs hindered gait even under low attentional demand, restricted sensory feedback may be an important factor to the mechanisms underlying FOG.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide association data has identified six new risk loci (SIPA1L2, INPP5F, MIR4697, GCH1, VPS13C, and DDRGK1) for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the characteristics of those loci in a Han Chinese population from mainland China are unknown. We examined genetic associations of VPS13C rs2414739, MIR4697 rs329648, GCH1 rs11158026, and SIPA1L2 rs10797576 with PD susceptibility in a Han Chinese population of 1028 sporadic PD patients and 1109 healthy controls. All subjects were genotyped for these loci using the Sequenom iPLEX Assay. We also conducted further stratified analysis according to age at onset and compared the clinical characteristics between minor allele carriers and non-carriers for each locus. However, we did not observe any significant difference in genotype distribution between PD patients and controls for the four loci, even after being stratified by age at onset. Besides, minor allele carriers cannot be distinguished from non-carriers based on their clinical features. Our findings first demonstrated that VPS13C rs2414739, MIR4697 rs329648, GCH1 rs11158026, and SIPA1L2 rs10797576 do not confer a significant risk for PD in Chinese population. Additional replication studies in other populations and functional studies are warranted to better validate the role of the four new loci in PD risk.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is widely considered as a central event in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The mechanisms underlying the oxidative damage-mediated loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD are not yet fully understood. Accumulating evidence has indicated that oxidative DNA damage plays a crucial role in programmed neuronal cell death, and is considered to be at least partly responsible for the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD. This process involves a number of signaling cascades and molecular proteins. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a pleiotropic protein affecting a wide range of vital cellular processes, including chromatin remodelling, DNA repair and cell cycle control, by interacting with a number of enzymes and regulatory proteins. In the present study, the exposure of PC12 cells to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) led to the loss of cell viability and decreased the expression levels of PCNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner, indicating that this protein may be involved in the neurotoxic actions of MPP+ in dopaminergic neuronal cells. In addition, a significant upregulation in p53 expression was also observed in this cellular model of PD. p53 is an upstream inducer of PCNA and it has been recognized as a key contributor responsible for dopaminergic neuronal cell death in mouse models of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD. This indicates that MPP+-induced oxidative damage is mediated by the downregulation of PCNA through the p53 pathway in a cellular model of PD. Thus, our results may provide some novel insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of PD and provide new possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are two neurodegenerative alpha-synucleinopathies characterized by severe impairment of the nigro-striatal pathway. Based on T1-, T2*-, and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), macro-structural and micro-structural abnormalities in these diseases can be detected.\nThis study was undertaken to compare the nigro-striatal changes that occur in patients with PD with those in patients with both variants of MSA (the parkinsonian variant, MSA-P, and the cerebellar variant, MSA-C), and to explore correlations between different MRI parameters and clinical data.\nWe simultaneously measured volume, T2* relaxation rates, and mean diffusivity in nigro-striatal structures (substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, and putamen) of 26 patients with PD and 29 patients with MSA (16 with MSA-P and 13 with MSA-C).\nSignificant changes in the putamina in patients with MSA were observed compared with patients with PD. Patients with MSA-P had higher mean diffusivity values in their putamina than did patients with PD or MSA-C. The putamina of both subgroups of MSA had higher T2* relaxation rates values than PD. Remarkably, discriminant analysis showed that using two measurements of microstructural damage (T2* relaxation rates and mean diffusivity in the putamen) allowed 96% accuracy to distinguish patients with PD from those with MSA-P. Correlation analyses between MRI findings and clinical variables revealed that patients with PD showed significant correlations only at the nigra. In patients with MSA, clinical variables correlated with MRI findings in both the nigra and striatum.\nMultimodal MRI reveals different pattern of nigro-striatal involvement in patients with PD and patients with MSA.",

Patients with MSA-P had higher mean diffusivity values in their putamina than did patients with PD or MSA-C. The putamina of both subgroups of MSA had higher T2* relaxation rates values than PD. Remarkably, discriminant analysis showed that using two measurements of microstructural damage (T2* relaxation rates and mean diffusivity in the putamen) allowed 96% accuracy to distinguish patients with PD from those with MSA-P. Correlation analyses between MRI findings and clinical variables revealed that patients with PD showed significant correlations only at the nigra. In patients with MSA, clinical variables correlated with MRI findings in both the nigra and striatum.",

    "abstract": "The genetic factors about the pathogenesis of sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD) is not completely clear at present; therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study, high-throughput sequencing analysis (HTPSA) of all cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) exons, loss-of-function assessment, and sorting intolerant from tolerant analysis of HTPSA data in 250 typical sPD and 250 controls, which found 55 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To further explore these SNPs, we sequenced the 30 most strongly associated SNPs in the 460 typical sPD cases and the 525 controls. All subjects were from the Han population of Chinese mainland and excluded the toxic exposure, the heavy coffee drinking, and the early- and late-onset sPD. The minor allele frequencies (MAFs) at c.3824T>G, c.3794T>C, and c.3819G>A were higher in the control. The TG of c.3824T>G, the TC of c.3794T>C, and the AG of c.3819G>A were associated with the decreased risk of sPD. The subjects carrying the minor C allele of c.3794T>C or the minor A allele of c.3819G>A exhibited a decreased risk of sPD. c.3824T>G negatively affected the binding affinity of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). c.3794T>C increased the surface area exposed to substrates. c.3819G>A most likely reduced the expression level of GAK. Our data suggest that the multiple SNPs of GAK synergistically participate in the pathogenesis of sPD through multiple pathways.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) carrying the G2019S mutation of the LRRK2 gene provide an opportunity of studying in a homogeneous setting the molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of common idiopathic forms of PD. However, whether common mechanisms are involved in both conditions in not known. Here, we compared genome-wide gene expression (RNA sequencing) in peripheral blood between PD patients carrying the G2019S mutation of the LRRK2 gene and idiopathic PD cases, to deepen in the understanding of this topic. In addition, we compared the blood transcriptome between 2 cohorts of carriers of the G2019S mutation (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and 2 cohorts of noncarriers (symptomatic and asymptomatic) for detecting transcriptomic changes attributable to the presence of the G2019S mutation. We searched for gene enrichment in Reactome or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. We found that despite some overlap, peripheral blood transcriptome differs widely between idiopathic and LRRK2 G2019S-associated PD, with only 4 deregulated pathways shared by both conditions (complement and coagulation cascades, cell adhesion molecules, hematopoietic cell lineage, and extracellular matrix organization). Changes in the blood transcriptome observed in asymptomatic carriers of the mutation included 6 genes known to be associated with PD in genome-wide association studies and also pathways related with immunity. Our findings emphasize the notion that PD is likely a pathogenically heterogeneous condition and suggest the existence of specific mechanisms involved in LRRK2-associated PD.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence indicates that different morphological types of cell death coexist in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but the molecular explanation for this is still under investigation. In this study, we identified perturbed pathways in two different cell models for PD through the following procedures: (1) enrichment pathway analysis with differentially expressed genes and the Reactome pathway database, and (2) construction of the shortest path model for the enriched pathway and detection of significant shortest path model with fitting time-course microarray data of each PD cell model to structural equation model. Two PD cell models constructed by the same neurotoxin showed different perturbed pathways. That is, one showed perturbation of three Reactome pathways, including cellular senescence, chromatin modifying enzymes, and chromatin organization, while six modules within metabolism pathway represented perturbation in the other. This suggests that the activation of common upstream cell death pathways in PD may result in various down-stream processes, which might be associated with different morphological types of cell death. In addition, our results might provide molecular clues for coexistence of different morphological types of cell death in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Abnormalities in reward processing may be a critical part of understanding nonmotor manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD). Dysfunction in dopaminergic pathways, which signal upcoming rewards, might result in altered motivation by incentives. To examine this proposal, we studied 16 patients with PD, both ON and OFF their normal dopaminergic medication, comparing them with healthy controls. Participants performed a speeded saccade task to obtain monetary rewards. Crucially, we manipulated the reward available from trial to trial, by presenting an auditory incentive precue before each saccade. The effects of incentives on pupil dilatation (an index of autonomic response) were measured. Individuals with PD showed diminished autonomic reward effects, compared with age-matched controls. When tested ON medication, pupil responses to reward increased, demonstrating that dopaminergic drugs can restore reward sensitivity. These findings reveal blunted autonomic responses to incentives in PD, which can be modulated by dopaminergic drugs.",

    "abstract": "Pre-operative predictive factors for optimal post-operative effect of subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been previously reported. No study has explicitly assessed the link between excess pre-operative body weight and STN stimulation outcome.\nWe retrospectively compared STN stimulation outcomes of 36 PD patients with excess pre-operative body weight (group 1) and 36 matched normal-weight pre-operative (group 2) PD patients. We focused on the post-operative outcomes in the sub-group of 12 obese (group 3) PD patients.\nThe post-operative motor improvement and the reduction of severity of levodopa-related complications were not statistically different between groups 1 and 2 (P>0.05). In the obese group (group 3), the axial sub-score significantly improved by 29.8% in the on-drug/on-stimulation conditions whereas the improvement was not significant in the off-drug/on-stimulation condition (22.4%, P=0.20). The post-operative Mattis Dementia Rating Score was significantly reduced in group 1 and group 3.\nWe considered that the post-operative axial impairment observed in the obese PD patients might be essentially consecutive to disease progression and/or post-operative DBS consequences, i.e. surgical procedure or electrical stimulation itself. Moreover, it could be argued that musculoskeletal disorders associated with obesity were responsible for the incomplete efficacy of STN stimulation on axial sub-scores, by increasing gait and balance impairment.\nPre-operative obesity may be regarded as a predictive clinical factor of axial and cognitive impairment after STN-DBS.",

    "abstract": "Hypomimia which refers to a reduced degree in facial expressiveness is a common sign in Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of our study was to investigate how hypomimia affects PD patients' facial expression of pain. The facial expressions of 23 idiopathic PD patients in the Off-phase (without dopaminergic medication) and On-phase (after dopaminergic medication intake) and 23 matched controls in response to phasic heat-pain and a temporal summation procedure were recorded and analyzed for overall and specific alterations using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). We found reduced overall facial activity in response to pain in PD patients in the Off which was less pronounced in the On. Especially the highly pain-relevant eye-narrowing occurred less frequently in PD patients than in controls in both phases while frequencies of other pain-relevant movements, like upper lip raise (in the On) and contraction of the eyebrows (in both phases), did not differ between groups. Moreover, opening of the mouth (which is often not considered as pain-relevant) was the most frequently displayed movement in PD patients, whereas eye-narrowing was the most frequent movement in controls. Not only overall quantitative changes in the degree of facial pain expressiveness occurred in PD patients but also qualitative changes were found. The latter refer to a strongly affected encoding of the sensory dimension of pain (eye-narrowing) while the encoding of the affective dimension of pain (contradiction of the eyebrows) was preserved. This imbalanced pain signal might affect pain communication and pain assessment.",

Physical examination revealed a heart rate (HR) of 269 bpm and a blood pressure of 116/94 mm Hg. Her ECG revealed a wide-complex tachycardia with right bundle branch morphology and an HR of 265 bpm. Intravenous adenosine was administered with resolution of the arrhythmia and symptoms. Her subsequent ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with \u03b4 waves, which was consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Laboratory findings confirmed thyroid storm and treatment began with intravenous hydrocortisone, methimazole, metoprolol, amiodarone and iodine drops. Graves' disease was confirmed based on the presence of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody.

    "abstract": "Recently, several studies showed that gastrointestinal tract may be associated with pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Intestine tight junction protein zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1) is an important component of intestinal barrier which can be degraded by matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9). In our previous study, a significant decline in ZO-1 was observed along with enhanced MMP-9 activity in the duodenum and distal colon of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated mice. In this study, the protective effect of simvastatin on ZO-1 was investigated using an MPTP mouse model of PD. Seven days after the end of MPTP application, the expression level of ZO-1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The protein expression levels of ZO-1 and MMP9 were detected by Western blotting. Meanwhile, MMP-9 activity was analyzed by gelatin zymography. MPTP treatment led to a decrease in the expression of ZO-1, which was accompanied by elevated MMP-9 activity. Treatment with simvastatin could partly reverse the MPTP-induced changes in ZO-1 expression and reduce MMP-9 protein and activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that simvastatin administration may partially reverse the impairment of ZO-1 induced by MPTP via inhibiting the activity of MMP9, fortify the impaired intestinal barrier and limit gut-derived toxins that pass across the intestinal barrier.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disease, is diagnostically defined by motor impairments, but also includes often under-recognized impairments in cognition, mood, sleep, and the autonomic nervous system. These problems can severely affect individuals' quality of life. In our prior research, we have developed indicators to measure the quality of care delivered to patients with Parkinson's disease, and we identified gaps in delivering evidence-based treatments for this population. Effective strategies to close these gaps are needed to improve patient quality of life.\nBuilding on prior research we developed a multi-faceted proactive implementation program called Care Coordination for Health Promotion and Activities in Parkinson's Disease (CHAPS). To be eligible, patients had to have at least two visits with a primary diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (ICD-9 code: 332.0) at one of five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in the southwestern United States from 2010 to 2014. The program consists of telephone assessments, evidence-based protocols, and tools to enhance patient self-management, care planning, and coordination of care across providers, including an electronic database to support and track coordination of care. Our mixed-methods study employs a randomized, controlled trial design to test whether the CHAPS intervention improves performance in 38 quality measures among an analytic sample of 346 patients. The 38 quality measures are categorized into overarching areas of communication, education, and continuity; regulatory reporting; diagnosis; periodic assessment; medication use; management of motor and non-motor symptoms; use of non-pharmacological approaches and therapies; palliative care; and health maintenance. Secondary outcomes are patient health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, and perceptions of care quality. We are also evaluating the extent of the CHAPS Program implementation and measuring program costs and impacts on health services utilization, in order to perform a analysis of the CHAPS program from the perspective of the Veterans Health Administration (VA). Outcomes are assessed by interviewer-administered surveys collected at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months, and by medical record chart abstractions. Analyses will be intention-to-treat.\nThe CHAPS Program is poised for dissemination within the VA National Parkinson's Disease Research, Education, and Clinical Center Consortium if demonstrated efficacious.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT01532986; registered on January 13, 2012.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that serve as key regulators of gene expression. They have been shown to be involved in a wide range of biological processes including neurodegenerative diseases. Genetic variants in miRNAs or miRNA-binding sites on their target genes could affect miRNA function and contribute to disease risk. Here, we investigated the association of miRNA-related genetic variants with Parkinson disease (PD) using data from the largest GWAS on PD. Of 243 miRNA variants, we identified rs897984:T>C in miR-4519 (P value = 1.3\u00d710(-5) and OR = 0.93) and rs11651671:A>G in miR-548at-5p (P value = 1.1\u00d710(-6) and OR = 1.09) to be associated with PD. We showed that the variant's mutant alleles change the secondary structure and decrease expression level of their related miRNAs. Subsequently, we highlighted target genes that might mediate the effects of miR-4519 and miR-548at-5p on PD. Among them, we experimentally showed that NSF is a direct target of miR-4519. Furthermore, among 48,844 miRNA-binding site variants, we found 32 variants (within 13 genes) that are associated with PD. Four of the host genes, CTSB, STX1B, IGSF9B, and HSD3B7, had not previously been reported to be associated with PD. We provide evidence supporting the potential impact of the identified miRNA-binding site variants on miRNA-mediated regulation of their host genes.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) has recently advanced our understanding of the major role played by this basal ganglion in human emotion. Research indicates that STN DBS can induce modifications in all components of emotion, and neuroimaging studies have shown that the metabolic modifications correlated with these emotional disturbances following surgery are both task- and sensory input-dependent. Nevertheless, to date, these modifications have not been confirmed for all emotional components, notably subjective emotional experience, or feelings. To identify the neural network underlying the modification of feelings following STN DBS, we assessed 16 patients with Parkinson's disease before and after surgery, using both subjective assessments of emotional experience and ",

    "abstract": "Despite the strong relationship between freezing of gait (FOG) and turning in Parkinson's disease (PD), few studies have addressed specific postural characteristics during turning that might contribute to freezing.\nThirty participants with PD (16 freezers, 14 non-freezers) (all tested OFF medication) and 14 healthy controls walked 5 meters and turned 180\u00b0 in a 3D gait laboratory. COM behavior was analyzed during four turning quadrants of 40\u00b0 between 10\u00b0 and 170\u00b0 pelvic rotation and during 40\u00b0 before actual FOG episodes. These pre-FOG segments were compared with similar turning sections in turns of freezers without FOG. Outcome parameters were turn time, COM distance, COM velocity, step width and the medial- and anterior COM position.\nTurn time was increased in freezers compared to non-freezers (p=.000). No differences were found regarding COM distance and velocity during turning quadrants between groups and between freezers' pre-FOG segments and similar turning segments without FOG. Medial COM deviation was reduced in PD patients compared to controls (p=.004), but no differences were found between freezers and non-freezers. In turns with freezing, turn time increased (p=.005) and step width decreased (p=.025) pre-FOG. Freezers also showed a less medial (p=.020) and more anterior (p=.016) COM position pre-FOG compared to turning sections without FOG.\nOur results revealed no subgroup differences in COM behavior during uninterrupted turning. However, we found a reduced medial deviation, a forward COM shift and a decreased step width in freezers just before FOG episodes. These abnormalities may play a causal role, as they could hamper stability and fluent weight shifting necessary for continued stepping during turning.",

    "abstract": "To observe the action of electroacupuncture (EA) intervention on the expression of gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx 43) and content of glutamate (Glu) in the striatum in Parkinson's disease (PD) rats, so as to reveal its mechanism underlying improvement of PD.\nForty male SD rats were randomly divided into normal control, sham operation, model and EA groups (n = 10 in each group). The PD model was duplicated by microinjection of 6-hydroxyldopamine (6-OHDA, 15 \u00b5g/rat) into the right striatum of rats (AP: 1.0, 1.0; R: 3.0, 4.5; H: 4.5, 6.0), and for control, the same dose of normal saline was injected into the right striatum for rats in the sham operation group. EA (2 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to \"Fengfu\" (GV 16) \"Taichong\" (LR 3) for 30 min, once a day for 2 weeks. The PD rats' rotational behavior changes (the numbers of rotations in 30 min) were detected following subcutaneous injection of apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg). The Glu concentration and the expression of Cx 43 in the striatum were detected by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Western blot, respectively.\nNo significant differences were found between the model group and EA group in the number of rotations before the treatment, between the control and sham operation groups in the levels of Glu content and Cx 43 protein expression in the striatum (P > 0.05). Compared with the control group, the Glu content and Cx 43 protein expression level were significantly increased in the model group (P < 0.01), while in comparison with the model group, the number of rotations was significantly reduced in the EA group (P < 0.05). Following EA intervention, both Glu content and Cx 43 expression were considerably down-regulated in the EA group compared with the model group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).\nEA can improve PD rats' rotation behavior, which may be associated with its effects in down-regulating the level of Glu and Cx 43 protein expression in the striatum.",

The conversion of alpha-synuclein from a soluble monomer to an insoluble fibril may underlie the neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's disease (PD).

    "abstract": "This review examines the evidence that deep brain stimulation (DBS) has extensive impact on nonmotor symptoms (NMSs) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nWe retrieved information from the PubMed database up to September, 2015, using various search terms and their combinations including PD, NMSs, DBS, globus pallidus internus (GPi), subthalamic nucleus (STN), and ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus.\nWe included data from peer-reviewed journals on impacts of DBS on neuropsychological profiles, sensory function, autonomic symptoms, weight changes, and sleep disturbances. For psychological symptoms and cognitive impairment, we tried to use more reliable proofs: Random, control, multicenter, large sample sizes, and long period follow-up clinical studies. We categorized the NMSs into four groups: those that would improve definitively following DBS; those that are not significantly affected by DBS; those that remain controversial on their surgical benefit; and those that can be worsened by DBS.\nIn general, it seems to be an overall beneficial effect of DBS on NMSs, such as sensory, sleep, gastrointestinal, sweating, cardiovascular, odor, urological symptoms, and sexual dysfunction, GPi-DBS may produce similar results; Both STN and Gpi-DBS are safe with regard to cognition and psychology over long-term follow-up, though verbal fluency decline is related to DBS; The impact of DBS on behavioral addictions and dysphagia is still uncertain.\nAs the motor effects of STN-DBS and GPi-DBS are similar, NMSs may determine the target choice in surgery of future patients.",

Patients with PD exhibit motor and no motor symptoms these may relate with changes in nutritional habits during disease progression. The prevalence of PD and nutritional factor could be different in rural areas compared to urban regions and can be associated with sociocultural and demographic features. It has been suggested a possible association between excessive intake of saturated fats and low consumption of vitamins such as B6 with EP, however, the results are still not conclusive. Some of significant factors could affect nutritional habits and status in PD in rural areas, are: health status, economic availability, environmental and geographical factors, among others. This review presents some eating habits and sociodemographic factors in PD principally in rural areas.\nLa enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) predomina en la poblaci\u00f3n de 65 a\u00f1os de edad o m\u00e1s y se caracteriza tanto por s\u00edntomas motores como no motores, los cuales pueden asociarse con cambios en la conducta alimentaria. Los factores nutricionales pueden depender de las caracter\u00edsticas socioculturales y sociodemogr\u00e1ficas, y esto a su vez podr\u00edan ser diferente en el medio rural en comparaci\u00f3n con el medio urbano.

    "abstract": "The early clinical trials using fetal ventral mesencephalic (VM) allografts in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have shown efficacy (albeit not in all cases) and have paved the way for further development of cell replacement therapy strategies in PD. The preclinical work that led to these clinical trials used allografts of fetal VM tissue placed into 6-OHDA lesioned rats, while the patients received similar allografts under cover of immunosuppression in an \u03b1-synuclein disease state. Thus developing models that more faithfully replicate the clinical scenario would be a useful tool for the translation of such cell-based therapies to the clinic.\nHere, we show that while providing functional recovery, transplantation of fetal dopamine neurons into the AAV-\u03b1-synuclein rat model of PD resulted in smaller-sized grafts as compared to similar grafts placed into the 6-OHDA-lesioned striatum. Additionally, we found that cyclosporin treatment was able to promote the survival of the transplanted cells in this allografted state and surprisingly also provided therapeutic benefit in sham-operated animals. We demonstrated that delayed cyclosporin treatment afforded neurorestoration in three complementary models of PD including the Thy1-\u03b1-synuclein transgenic mouse, a novel AAV-\u03b1-synuclein mouse model, and the MPTP mouse model. We then explored the mechanisms for this benefit of cyclosporin and found it was mediated by both cell-autonomous mechanisms and non-cell autonomous mechanisms.\nThis study provides compelling evidence in favor for the use of immunosuppression in all grafted PD patients receiving cell replacement therapy, regardless of the immunological mismatch between donor and host cells, and also suggests that cyclosporine treatment itself may act as a disease-modifying therapy in all PD patients.",

    "results": "Here, we show that while providing functional recovery, transplantation of fetal dopamine neurons into the AAV-\u03b1-synuclein rat model of PD resulted in smaller-sized grafts as compared to similar grafts placed into the 6-OHDA-lesioned striatum. Additionally, we found that cyclosporin treatment was able to promote the survival of the transplanted cells in this allografted state and surprisingly also provided therapeutic benefit in sham-operated animals. We demonstrated that delayed cyclosporin treatment afforded neurorestoration in three complementary models of PD including the Thy1-\u03b1-synuclein transgenic mouse, a novel AAV-\u03b1-synuclein mouse model, and the MPTP mouse model. We then explored the mechanisms for this benefit of cyclosporin and found it was mediated by both cell-autonomous mechanisms and non-cell autonomous mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) can be classified into the tremor dominant (TD) subtype and the postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) subtype, which present with different clinical courses and prognoses. However, the symptom-specific intrinsic neural mechanisms underlying the subtypes of PD still remain elusive. In the current study, we utilized resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) combined with the regional homogeneity (ReHo) method to investigate the modulations of neural activity in 13 patients with predominantly PIGD (p-PIGD) and 15 patients with predominantly TD (p-TD) in the resting state. Compared with healthy controls, the p-PIGD and the p-TD groups both displayed ReHo changes in the default mode network (DMN). By contrast, the p-TD group exhibited more ReHo alterations in the cerebellum involved in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) loops, whilst the p-PIGD group in extensive cortical and sub-cortical areas, including the frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal, limbic lobes, basal ganglia and thalamus, which are involved in the striatal-thalamo-cortical (STC) loops. Direct comparison between the two groups showed significant ReHo alterations in the primary visual cortex. Our findings underscore the differential involvement of the STC and CTC circuits underlying the two subtypes of PD. Moreover, relatively widespread neural activity abnormality, especially in the motor-related regions as well as the visual network, is apparently a characteristic feature of PIGD symptoms. This study could shed light on the underlying pathophysiology and clinical heterogeneity of PD presentation.",

    "abstract": "Rest tremor (RT), a tremor that occurs in a body part that is completely supported against gravity, is together with rigidity and bradykinesia among the core features of Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition to classical RT, many PD patients also have action tremor (AT) occurring during sustained postures or voluntary movement. Earlier studies showed a good correlation between striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding, measured with [(123)I] FP-CIT SPET and bradykinesia. By contrast, neither rigidity nor rest tremor seems to be closely related to the degree of dopaminergic denervation as measured by DAT imaging. Little is known about the relationship, if any, between the severity of action tremor and striatal DAT binding.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted in 94 patients (57 men and 37 women) with Parkinson's disease staging 1-2 on the Hoehn-Yahr scale. Data on the severity of action tremor and other motor signs were collected using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III. DAT imaging was performed after injection of 111-185MBq of (123)I-FP-CIT. Images were visualized on Workstation Xeleris 3.0 (GE Healthcare) and reconstructed with dedicated software by a nuclear physician blinded about the clinical information of patients. Spearman correlation coefficient was performed to evaluate the relationship between putamen DAT binding and severity of bradykinesia, severity of rigidity, RT and AT respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between age, sex, disease duration, and levodopa equivalent daily dose and investigated variables after adjusting for possible confounders.\nIn this group of patients with early PD, DAT binding in the putamen significantly correlated with the severity of bradykinesia (Spearman r=-0.35, P<0.001) but not with the severity of rigidity (Spearman r=0.02, P=0.8), RT (Spearman r=0.05, P=0.6), or AT (Spearman r=-0.03, P=0.7). The findings were confirmed by multivariable regression analysis adjusted by age, sex, disease duration, and levodopa equivalent daily dose.\nOur study confirms the good correlation between putamen DAT binding and bradykinesia and the lack of correlation between putamen DAT binding and rigidity/RT. In addition, we failed to found any significant correlation between putamen DAT binding and severity of action tremor, which suggests a contribution of non-dopaminergic mechanisms to its pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Aim. In this study we examined the influence of tetrandrine (Tet) on the neuroprotective effects of glutathione (GSH) in the 6-hydroxydopamine- (6-OHDA-) lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods. Levels in the redox system, dopamine (DA) metabolism, dopaminergic neuronal survival, and apoptosis of the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum, as well as the rotational behavior of animals were examined after a 50-day administration of GSH + Tet (or GSH) and/or L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) to PD rats. Ethics Committee of Huashan Hospital, Fudan University approved the protocol (number SYXK2009-0082). Results. Administration of GSH or Tet alone did not show any significant effects on the factors evaluated in the PD rats. However, in the GSH + Tet group, we observed markedly decreased oxidative damage, inhibition of DA metabolism and enhanced DA synthesis, increased tyrosine hydroxylase- (TH-) immunopositive neuronal survival, and delayed apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the SN. Animal rotational behavior was improved in the GSH + Tet group. Additionally, coadministration of GSH + Tet appeared to offset the possible oxidative neurotoxicity induced by L-dopa. Conclusion. In this study, we demonstrated that tetrandrine allowed occurrence of the neuroprotective effect of glutathione probably due to inhibition of P-glycoprotein on 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat models of Parkinson's disease, including rats undergoing long-term L-dopa treatment.",

    "abstract": "Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation is an emerging strategy for restoring neuronal function in neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), which is characterized by a profound and selective loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Adult neurogenesis generates newborn neurons that can be observed at specialized niches where endothelial cells (ECs) play a significant role in regulating the behavior of NSCs, including self-renewal and differentiating into all neural lineage cells. In this minireview, we highlight the importance of establishing an appropriate microenvironment at the target site of NSC transplantation, where grafted cells integrate into the surroundings in order to enhance DA neurotransmission. Using a novel model of NSC-EC coculture, it is possible to combine ECs with NSCs, to generate such a neurovascular microenvironment. With appropriate NSCs selected, the composition of the transplant can be investigated through paracrine and juxtacrine signaling within the neurovascular unit (NVU). With target site cellular and acellular compartments of the microenvironment recognized, guided DA differentiation of NSCs can be achieved. As differentiated DA neurons integrate into the existing nigrostriatal DA pathway, the symptoms of PD can potentially be alleviated by reversing characteristic neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and visual hallucinations (VH) are common co-morbidities and risk factors for dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD). The relative value of each of them in the progression to dementia is unknown. We investigated cognitive impairment and cerebral hypometabolism in PD-MCI patients with VH (VH-positive) and without (VH-negative).\nTwenty-one PD-MCI patients (12 VH-negative, nine VH-positive) and 19 controls were studied using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). The neuropsychological assessment was repeated after 30 months. Regional FDG uptake was analyzed using statistical parametric mapping.\nVH-positive patients had lower FDG uptake bilaterally in the occipital, and parietal cortex, right temporal lobe and in the left cingulum compared with VH-negative patients. The two groups showed no significant differences in clinical characteristics and cognitive status at baseline. After 30 months of follow-up, three (25%) and four (50%) of the VH-negative and VH-positive patients, respectively, had progressed to dementia.\nEven in the absence of significant cognitive differences, PD-MCI patients with VH exhibit more severe cerebral hypometabolism and had a higher rate of progression to dementia than VH-negative patients, supporting the importance of VH and cerebral hypometabolism in establishing the risk of dementia in PD-MCI.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease which leads to postural and gait disorders, limitation in mobility, activities of daily living and disability.\nThe aim of the study is to assess the effects of the rehabilitation program on balance, gait, motor performance and trunk rotations in PD patients.\nSixty-four patients with 1.5-3.0 stage PD in the Hoehn and Yahr scale were randomly allocated to rehabilitation and control groups. Sixty-one patients completed the study. Patients were assessed three times, at month intervals. Between the first and second assessments, the rehabilitation group participated in a rehabilitation training program focused on mobility, balance and gait exercises, consisting of 28 sessions. Balance was assessed with tandem stance and the Pastor test (shoulder tug). Gait was assessed with a 10\u00a0m walk at preferred speed and 360\u00b0 turn. Motor performance was evaluated by means of the Physical Performance Test (PPT) and timed motor activities. The trunk rotations were measured in the lumbar and thoraco-lumbar spine with a tape measure.\nThe rehabilitation group significantly improved (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in balance and gait outcomes, PPT score, timed activities and trunk rotations both in comparison to the control group and baseline results. The positive effects of the exercise program maintained for at least 1\u00a0month.\nThe 4-week rehabilitation training program focused on mobility, balance and gait exercises improved balance, gait, physical performance and trunk rotations in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to explore validity of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale in measuring cognitive impairment among individuals with Parkinson's disease. The scale was created for use in patients with Alzheimer's disease and, to date, there have been no published studies examining if this tool is appropriate for patients with Parkinson's disease.\nThe data were obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database and included 490 subjects diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, further categorized as having Parkinson's disease dementia (n= 151), mild cognitive impairment (n= 186), or normal cognition (n = 153) by a treating physician. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values were calculated for the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Global Score as well as the Sum of Boxes Score using existing cutoff scores. Finally, new cutoff scores were calculated using sensitivity and specificity values derived using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves.\nSensitivity and specificity of the published Global Score cutoff scores for patients with dementia were .34 and .10, respectively. The newly calculated cutoff scores for patients with dementia yielded a sensitivity of .79 and a specificity of .96. The area under the curve was 0.92 (95% CI = 0.90-0.95).\nThe CDR is a useful tool in identifying dementia in patients with Parkinson's disease when the cutoff scores are adjusted.",

    "abstract": "To assess whether cigarette smoking interferes with dopaminergic transmission in current- and never-smoking patients with Parkinson's disease.\nStriatal [123I]FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography was performed in 67 patients with Parkinson's disease (35 women and 32 men aging 60.8 \u00b1 10.1 years and staging 1.76 \u00b1 0.5 on the Hoehn and Yahr scale). At study time, there were 13 current-smokers and 54 never-smokers.\nCurrent-smokers showed a significantly lower putamen/occipital [123I]FP-CIT ratio and a non-significant trend to a lower caudate/occipital [123I]FP-CIT ratio uptake. Current-smokers were also characterized by a lower off UPDRS-III motor score. A logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, disease duration, Hoehn and Yahr staging, and medication indicated a significant lower [123I]FP-CIT uptake not only in the putamen (odds ratio, 0.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.01 to 0.65; P = 0.02) but also in the caudate (odds ratio, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.71; P = 0.015) as well as a lower UPDRS-III motor score (odds ratio, 0.9; 95% confidence interval, 0.81 to 0.99; P = 0.04) in current-smokers.\nThe lower [123I]FP-CIT uptake together with the lower UPDRS-III motor score observed in our current-smokers patients with Parkinson's disease (even taking into account variables that are probably expression of dopaminergic neuron decline and treatment) would support an effect of smoking on dopaminergic synaptic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The current study investigated whether motivational dysfunction in Parkinson's patients is related to a deficit in preparing for motivated behavior. Based on previous studies, it was hypothesized that PD patients would show reduced preparation for action specifically when faced with threat (of loss) and that reduced action preparation would relate to self-report of apathy symptoms. The study measured an electrocortical correlate of preparation for action (CNV amplitude) in PD patients and healthy controls, as well as defensive and appetitive activation during emotional perception (LPP amplitude). The sample included 18 non-demented PD patients (tested on dopaminergic medications) and 15 healthy controls who responded as quickly as possible to cues signaling threat of loss or reward, in which the speed of the response determined the outcome. Results indicated that, whereas PD patients showed similar enhanced action preparation with the addition of incentives to controls, PD patients showed generally reduced action preparation, evidenced by reduced CNV amplitude overall. Results suggest that PD patients may have behavioral issues due to globally impaired action preparation but that this deficit is not emotion-specific, and movement preparation may be aided by incentive in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), using standard coils, provided modest symptomatic benefits in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In our previous exploratory studies, using the newly developed Hesed coil (providing deeper rTMS; rDTMS) high frequency (HF), excitatory rDTMS over the primary motor cortex (M1), did not achieve sufficient beneficial effect for PD symptoms, while low frequency (LF) inhibitory stimulation, was mildly beneficial. To further investigate the optimal rDTMS stimulation parameters for PD patients, and to assess whether there is an added value for dual stimulation, consisting of HF rDTMS over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) along with LF M1 rDTMS. The rational for the selection of the current stimulation parameters and sites lies on the previous studies that demonstrated an inhibitory effect of 1Hz rTMS on the increased cortical activity in PD as well as dopamine release by PFC stimulation.\nAn open comparative active study of one month duration (12 sessions) of LF rDTMS over M1 alone (n=9) or combined with HF PFC rDTMS (M1-PFC, n=10). Outcome measures included the total and motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores (T-UPDRS and M-UPDRS) and other variables, were collected at baseline and on days 30 and 60.\nFor the M1+PFC group, T-UPDRS score improved from baseline to day 30, by 15% (median: 52 points, decreased to 44, p=0.02, effect size: 0.51) and M-UPDRS score improved by 24% (median: 37 points decreased to 28, p=0.04, effect size: 0.47). The corresponding results for the M1 group were insignificant. Additionally, the between groups comparison, was insignificant.\nrDTMS, consisting of M1 excitation with PFC inhibition improved PD motor symptoms but was not significantly superior to M1 rDTMS alone. rDTMS stimulation protocols for M1 should be further evaluated in larger scale controlled studies.",

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are key epigenetic enzymes and emerging drug targets in cancer and neurodegeneration. Pan-HDAC inhibitors provided neuroprotection in Parkinson's Disease (PD) models, however, the HDAC isoforms with highest neuroprotective potential remain unknown. Zebrafish larvae (powerful pharmacological testing tools bridging cellular and in vivo studies) have thus far been used in PD modelling with limited phenotypic characterization. Here we characterize the behavioural and metabolic phenotypes of a zebrafish PD model induced with MPP(+), assess the feasibility of targeting zebrafish HDAC1 and HDAC6 isoforms, and test the in vivo effects of their selective inhibitors MS-275 and tubastatin A, respectively. MPP(+) induced a concentration-dependent decrease in metabolic activity and sensorimotor reflexes, and induced locomotor impairments rescuable by the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine. Zebrafish HDAC1 and HDAC6 isoforms show high sequence identity with mammalian homologues at the deacetylase active sites, and pharmacological inhibition increased acetylation of their respective histone and tubulin targets. MS-275 and tubastatin rescued the MPP(+)-induced decrease in diencephalic tyrosine hydroxylase immunofluorescence and in whole-larvae metabolic activity, without modifying mitochondrial complex activity or biogenesis. MS-275 or tubastatin alone modulated spontaneous locomotion. When combined with MPP(+), however, neither MS-275 nor tubastatin rescued locomotor impairments, although tubastatin did ameliorate the head-reflex impairment. This study demonstrates the feasibility of pharmacologically targeting the zebrafish HDAC1 and HDAC6 isoforms, and indicates that their inhibition can rescue cellular metabolism in a PD model. Absence of improvement in locomotion, however, suggests that monotherapy with either HDAC1 or HDAC6 inhibitors is unlikely to provide strong benefits in PD. This study highlights parameters dependent on the integrity of zebrafish neuronal circuits as a valuable complement to cell-based studies. Also, the demonstrated feasibility of pharmacologically targeting HDAC1 and HDAC6 in this organism paves the way for future studies investigating HDAC inhibitors in other diseases modelled in zebrafish.",

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the association of serum IGF-1 levels in de novo, drug na\u00efve PD patients compared with healthy controls.\nPubmed, ISI Web of Science, OVID, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases from 1966 to October 2014 were utilized to identify candidate studies using Medical Subjective Headings without language restriction. A random-effects model was chosen, with subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis conducted to reveal underlying heterogeneity among the included studies.\nIn this meta-analysis, we found that PD patients had higher serum IGF-1 levels compared with healthy controls (summary mean difference [MD] = 17.75, 95%CI = 6.01, 29.48). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the source of heterogeneity was population differences within the total group. Sensitivity analysis showed that the combined MD was consistent at any time omitting any one study.\nThe results of this meta-analysis demonstrate that serum IGF-1 levels were significantly higher in de novo, drug-na\u00efve PD patients compared with healthy controls. Nevertheless, additional endeavors are required to further explore the association between serum IGF-1 levels and diagnosis, prognosis and early therapy for PD.",

    "abstract": "It has been a long standing hypothesis that blood tissue of PD Parkinson's disease (PD) patients may exhibit signs of accelerated aging. Here we use DNA methylation based biomarkers of aging (\"epigenetic clock\") to assess the aging rate of blood in two ethnically distinct case-control data sets. Using n=508 Caucasian and n=84 Hispanic blood samples, we assess a) the intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration of blood (IEAA), which is independent of blood cell counts, and b) the extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration rate of blood (EEAA) which is associated with age dependent changes in blood cell counts. Blood of PD subjects exhibits increased age acceleration according to both IEAA (p=0.019) and EEAA (p=6.1 x 10(-3)). We find striking differences in imputed blood cell counts between PD cases and controls. Compared to control subjects, PD subjects contains more granulocytes (p=1.0 x 10(-9) in Caucasians, p=0.00066 in Hispanics) but fewer T helper cells (p=1.4 x 10(-6) in Caucasians, p=0.0024 in Hispanics) and fewer B cells (p=1.6 x 10(-5) in Caucasians, p=4.5 x 10(-5) in Hispanics). Overall, this study shows that the epigenetic age of the immune system is significantly increased in PD patients and that granulocytes play a significant role.",

    "abstract": "Effective therapies for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD) dementia will require accurate diagnosis and an understanding of the contribution of distinct molecular pathologies to these diseases. We seek to use imaging biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy and to clarify the contribution of molecular species to cognitive impairment in DLB and PD.\nWe have performed cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies in subjects with DLB, PD with normal cognition, PD with mild cognitive impairment and PD with dementia, contrasted with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy control subjects (HCS). Subjects underwent formal neurological examination, detailed neuropsychological assessments, MRI and PET scans with the radioligands altropane (a dopamine transporter, DAT) and Pittsburgh compound B (PiB; \u03b2-amyloid). Putamen DAT concentrations were similar in DLB and PD and differentiated them from HCS and AD. Decreased caudate DAT concentration related to functional impairment in DLB but not PD. PiB uptake was greatest in DLB. However, cortical PiB retention was common in PD and predicted cognitive decline. PET imaging of tau aggregates holds promise both to clarify the contribution of tau to cognitive decline in these diseases and to differentiate DLB and PD from the parkinsonian tauopathies.\nTogether, DAT and amyloid PET imaging discriminate DLB from PD and from other disease groups and identify pathological processes that contribute to their course. Multimodal PET imaging has the potential to increase the diagnostic accuracy of DLB and PD in the clinic, improve cohort uniformity for clinical trials, and serve as biomarkers for targeted molecular therapies.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence supports a role for brain gangliosides in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Recently we deciphered the ganglioside-recognition code controlling specific ganglioside binding to Alzheimer's \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b21-42) peptide and Parkinson's disease-associated protein \u03b1-synuclein. Cracking this code allowed us to engineer a short chimeric A\u03b2/\u03b1-synuclein peptide that recognizes all brain gangliosides. Here we show that ganglioside-deprived neural cells do no longer sustain the formation of zinc-sensitive amyloid pore channels induced by either A\u03b21-42 or \u03b1-synuclein, as assessed by single-cell Ca(2+) fluorescence microscopy. Thus, amyloid channel formation, now considered a key step in neurodegeneration, is a ganglioside-dependent process. Nanomolar concentrations of chimeric peptide competitively inhibited amyloid pore formation induced by A\u03b21-42 or \u03b1-synuclein in cultured neural cells. Moreover, this peptide abrogated the intracellular calcium increases induced by Parkinson's-associated mutant forms of \u03b1-synuclein (A30P, E46K and A53T). The chimeric peptide also prevented the deleterious effects of A\u03b21-42 on synaptic vesicle trafficking and decreased the A\u03b21-42-induced impairment of spontaneous activity in rat hippocampal slices. Taken together, these data show that the chimeric peptide has broad anti-amyloid pore activity, suggesting that a common therapeutic strategy based on the prevention of amyloid-ganglioside interactions is a reachable goal for both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.",

    "abstract": "Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is the most common form of supraventricular tachycardia. In contrast, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern consists of an accessory pathway, which may result in the development of ventricular arrhythmias. Frequent tachycardia caused by AVNRT and accessory pathways may play a role in left ventricular systolic dysfunction.\nA 54-year-old man presented with palpitations and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. His baseline EKG showed Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern. While hospitalized, he had an episode of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). He underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation for AVNRT, and his accessory pathway was also ablated even though its conduction was found to be weak. He was clinically doing well on follow-up visit, with resolution of his heart failure symptoms and normalization of left ventricular function on echocardiography.\nThis case raises the question whether the accessory pathway plays a role in the development of systolic dysfunction, and if there is any role for ablation in patients with asymptomatic WPW pattern.",

    "abstract": "This study assesses the association between disease onset side (dominant or non-dominant) and vision on postural control of Parkinson's disease patients. Patient volunteers composed two groups, according to the onset side affected: Dominant group (n=9; M age=66.1 yr., SD=7.2; 6 women, 3 men) and Non-dominant group (n=9; M age=67.4 yr., SD=6.4; 6 women, 3 men). The groups' postural control was assessed by posturography during quiet upright stance in two conditions, Eyes open and Eyes closed. Two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs; group\u00d7condition) with repeated measures for the second factor assessed the differences associated with affected hemibody and vision on postural control. Analyses indicated that patients with the dominant side affected also presented significantly greater variation in center of pressure than those with the non-dominant side affected, mainly in the Eyes closed condition. The results demonstrate a higher reliance on vision in the dominant side, possibly to compensate somatosensory system impairments. These results also highlight the importance of analyzing the hemibody affected by the disease when postural control is assessed in this population.",

    "abstract": "To identify the characteristics of cervical deformities in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the role of severity of PD in the development of cervical spine deformities, the authors investigated the prevalence of the cervical deformities, cervical kyphosis (CK), and cervical positive sagittal malalignment (CPSM) in patients with PD. They also analyzed the association of severity of cervical deformities with the stage of PD in the context of global sagittal spinopelvic alignment.\nThis study was a prospective assessment of consecutively treated patients (n = 89) with PD. A control group of the age- and sex-matched patients was selected from patients with degenerative cervical spine disease but without PD. Clinical and demographic parameters including age, sex, duration of PD, and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage were collected. Full-length standing radiographs were used to assess spinopelvic parameters. CK was defined as a C2-7 Cobb angle < 0\u00b0. CPSM was defined as C2-7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA) > 4 cm.\nA significantly higher prevalence of CPSM (28% vs. 1.1%, p < 0.001), but not CK (12% vs. 10.1%, p = 0.635), was found in PD patients compared with control patients. Among patients with PD, those with CK were younger (62.1 vs. 69.0 years, p = 0.013) and had longer duration of PD (56.4 vs. 36.2 months, p = 0.034), but the severity of PD was not significantly different. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of CK was associated with younger age, higher mismatch between pelvic incidence and lumbar lordosis, and lower C7-S1 SVA. The patients with CPSM had significantly greater thoracic kyphosis (TK) (p < 0.001) and a trend toward more advanced H&Y stage (p = 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that CPSM was associated with male sex, greater TK, and more advanced H&Y stage.\nPatients with PD have a significantly higher prevalence of CPSM compared with age- and sex-matched control patients with cervical degenerative disease but without PD. Among patients with PD, CK is not associated with the severity of PD but is associated with overall global sagittal malalignment. In contrast, the presence of CPSM is associated more with the severity of PD than it is with the presence of global sagittal malalignment. Collectively, these data suggest that the neuromuscular pathogenesis of PD may affect the development of CPSM more than of CK.",

    "abstract": "The etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown, aging being the strongest risk factor for brain degeneration. Understanding PD pathogenesis and how aging increases the risk of disease would aid the development of therapies able to slow or prevent the progression of this neurodegenerative disorder. In this review we provide an overview of the most promising therapeutic targets and strategies to delay the loss of dopaminergic neurons observed both in PD and aging. Among them, handling alpha-synuclein toxicity, enhancing proteasome and lysosome clearance, ameliorating mitochondrial disruptions and modifying the glial environment are so far the most promising candidates. These new and conventional drugs may present problems related to their labile nature and to the difficulties in reaching the brain. Thus, we highlight the latest types of drug delivery system (DDS)-based strategies for PD treatment, including DDS for local and systemic drug delivery. Finally, the ongoing challenges for the discovery of new targets and the opportunities for DDS-based therapies to improve and efficacious PD therapy will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is needed for useful symptomatic therapy, is based on clinical criteria. However, it became quite clear in recent years that the same features can occur through different etiopathogenic mechanisms. Even a pathological diagnosis of PD, based on the demonstration of \u03b1-synuclein deposits in a typical distribution, can result from different causes and, vice versa, nigral cell loss can occur without \u03b1-synuclein deposition.\nThus far, attempts to influence the progression of PD have failed. However, since the clinical manifestations of PD can be the result of diverse mechanisms, a single intervention may not be able to slow the course of the disease in all patients. Indeed, targeting the underlying pathogenic processes, which differ among cases, may be more effective. PD may develop as a consequence of mitochondrial damage, which itself may result from a variety of genetic or environmental factors. Correction of the ensuing oxidative stress may theoretically be useful in these PD patients, but will not affect the progression of the disease among other PD patients in whom an identical clinical syndrome derives from defects in other pathways such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system and lysosomal dysfunction, among others. Precision medicine can now be used to identify the underlying pathogenic mechanisms in individual patients, paving the way to the development of real disease modification through a pathway-oriented approach, aimed at the underlying biologic processes of disease occurrence and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Twiddler syndrome is described as a spontaneous rotation or intentional external manipulation of implanted cardiac or occasionally deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices. We report this hardware related complication in a patient with tremor dominant Parkinson's disease (PD), who underwent unilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS and subsequently developed twiddler syndrome. The clinical course of twiddler syndrome in this patient is described. Some surgical nuances which may prevent its occurrence are suggested. Our case report indicates that twiddler syndrome occurs in DBS patients. Impedance check of DBS hardware, plain chest X-ray, or palpation for a knobbly extension lead through the skin above the IPG allows the correct diagnosis and subsequently a prompt surgical revision. Our subsequent literature review revealed only 10 patients with twiddler syndrome in DBS patient population worldwide. This number may suggest that this syndrome may be unrecognized or underreported, given the number of patients with movement disorders implanted with DBS hardware worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most-common genetic determinants of Parkinson's disease (PD). The G2019S mutation is detected most frequently and is associated with increased kinase activity. Whereas G2019S mutant dopamine neurons exhibit neurite elongation deficits, the effect of G2019S on other neuronal subtypes is unknown. As PD patients also suffer from non-motor symptoms that may be unrelated to dopamine neuron loss, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to assess morphological and functional properties of peripheral sensory neurons. LRRK2 G2019S iPSC-derived sensory neurons exhibited normal neurite length but had large microtubule-containing neurite aggregations. Additionally, LRRK2 G2019S iPSC-derived sensory neurons displayed altered calcium dynamics. Treatment with LRRK2 kinase inhibitors resulted in significant, but not complete, morphological and functional rescue. These data indicate a role for LRRK2 kinase activity in sensory neuron structure and function, which when disrupted, may lead to sensory neuron deficits in PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work was to identify early clinical predictors of important outcomes in Parkinson's disease (PD). In PD, treatment-resistant (e.g., dementia, falling) and other important functional outcomes (e.g., declines in quality of life [QOL] and activities of daily living [ADL]) emerge and become increasingly disabling.\nWe analyzed longitudinal data from 491 early, untreated PD subjects who enrolled in the PreCEPT trial, had baseline SPECT dopamine transporter deficit, and have continued in the PostCEPT observational cohort. After PreCEPT, antiparkinsonian medications were added if needed. Baseline clinical precursors were examined as potential predictors of selected outcomes. Separate and multivariate logistic regressions, adjusted for certain baseline factors, were performed for dichotomized outcomes evaluated at the last PostCEPT visit.\nOn enrollment, subjects had average disease duration of 0.8\u00a0years and were followed for an average of 5.5\u00a0years. Some baseline precursors were found to be predictive: disease stage, cognitive, and ADL scores for dementia; disease stage, ADL, and motor and freezing scores for hallucinations; disease stage, depression, ADL, and freezing and walking scores for falling; and ADL, depression, and motor and walking scores and disease stage for QOL decline. No baseline clinical feature predicted decline in ADL. Being on levodopa was not a significant predictor of any outcome, but subjects on a dopamine agonist were significantly \nAlthough there are limitations, results support the value of longitudinal follow-up of clinical trial populations to identify early clinical precursors of important outcomes and thereby identify high-risk patients early on.",

    "abstract": "In Braak's model of ascending degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD), involvement of the amygdala occurs simultaneously with substantia nigra degeneration. However, the clinical manifestations of amygdalar involvement in PD have not been fully delineated. Considered a multitask manager, the amygdala is a densely connected \"hub,\" coordinating and integrating tasks ranging from prompt, multisensorial emotion recognition to adequate emotional responses and emotional tuning of memories. Although phylogenetically predisposed to handle fear, the amygdala handles both aversive and positive emotional inputs. In PD, neuropathological and in vivo studies suggest primarily amygdalar hypofunction. However, as dopamine acts as an inverted U-shaped amygdalar modulator, medication-induced hyperactivity of the amygdala can occur. We propose that amygdalar (network) dysfunction contributes to reduced recognition of negative emotional face expressions, impaired theory of mind, reactive hypomimia, and impaired decision making. Similarly, impulse control disorders in predisposed individuals, hallucinations, anxiety, and panic attacks may be related to amygdalar dysfunction. When available, we discuss amygdala-independent trigger mechanisms of these symptoms. Although dopaminergic agents have mostly an activation effect on amygdalar function, adaptive and compensatory network changes may occur as well, but these have not been sufficiently explored. In conclusion, our model of amygdalar involvement brings together several elements of Parkinson's disease phenomenology heretofore left unexplained and provides a framework for testable hypotheses in patients during life and in autopsy analyses.",

    "abstract": "6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) is a neurotoxin frequently used to create in vitro and in vivo experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD), a chronic neurodegenerative disorder largely resulting from damage to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. No effective drugs or therapies have been developed for this devastating disorder, and current regimens of symptomatic therapeutics only alleviate symptoms temporarily. Therefore, effective treatments that reverse or cure this disorder are urgently needed. The aim of the study described in this report was to investigate the therapeutic impact of B355252, an aryl thiophene sulfonamide chemical entity, in the widely recognized in vitro model of PD, and to characterize the molecular signaling pathways. We show here that 6-OHDA-induced cell death in HT22, a murine neuronal cell model, through a pathway that involves the mitochondria by increasing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), raising intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)]i), enhancing the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and promoting activation of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) signaling pathway. More importantly, we found that B355252 protected HT22 neurons against 6-OHDA toxin-induced neuronal cell death by significant attenuation of ROS production, blocking of mitochondrial depolarization, inhibition of cytochrome c release, sequestration of [Ca(2+)]i, modulation of JNK cascade, and strong inhibition of caspase 3/7 cleavage. Overall, this study demonstrates that death of neurons under toxic conditions characteristic of PD can be efficiently halted by B355252 and suggests that further development of the molecule could be potentially beneficial as a therapeutic prevention or treatment option for PD.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) showed reduced myocardial (123)I-MIBG uptake, which may affect autonomic regulation. We investigated correlation between MIBC accumulation and cardiovascular autonomic function in PD. Methods. We performed myocardial MIBG scintigraphy, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, and the head-up tilt test (HUT) in 50 PD patients (66.4 \u00b1 7.8 years; duration 5.5 \u00b1 5.9 years). Autonomic function tests were also performed in 50 healthy controls (66.5 \u00b1 8.9 years). As HRV parameters, a high-frequency power (HF, 0.15-0.4\u2009Hz), a low-frequency power (LF, 0.04-0.15\u2009Hz), and LF/HF ratio were used. Results. Our PD patients had a significant reduction in LF and HF compared with the controls (P = 0.005 and P = 0.01). In HUT, systolic and diastolic blood pressure falls in the PD group were significantly greater than those in the controls (P = 0.02 and P = 0.02). The washout rate of MIBG was negatively correlated with blood pressure changes during HUT. Conclusion. Our PD patients showed reduced HRV, blood pressure dysregulation, and reduced MIBG accumulation, which was correlated with blood pressure dysregulation. Orthostatic hypotension in PD may be mainly caused by sympathetic postganglionic degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Various neuroimaging studies demonstrated that the fronto-insular network is implicated in impulsive behavior. We compared glucose metabolism (as a proxy measure of neural activity) among 24 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who presented with low or high levels of impulsivity based on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11 (BIS) scores. Subjects underwent 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and the voxel-wise group difference of FDG-metabolism was analyzed in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8). Subsequently, we performed a partial correlation analysis between the FDG-metabolism and BIS scores, controlling for covariates (i.e., age, sex, severity of disease and levodopa equivalent daily doses). Voxel-wise group comparison revealed higher FDG-metabolism in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and right insula in patients with higher impulsivity scores. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the FDG-metabolism and BIS scores. Our findings provide evidence that high impulsivity is associated with increased FDG-metabolism within the fronto-insular network in PD.",

    "abstract": "Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) activates the vestibular afferents, and these changes in vestibular input exert a strong influence on the subject's posture or standing balance. In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), vestibular dysfunction might contribute to postural instability and gait disorders.\nCurrent intensity was increased to 0.7 mA, and the current was applied to the patients for 20 minutes. To perform a sham stimulation, the current intensity was increased as described and then decreased to 0 mA over the course of 10 seconds. The patient's status was recorded continuously for 20 minutes with the patient in the supine position.\nThree out of 5 patients diagnosed with PD with postural instability and/or abnormal axial posture showed a reduction in postural instability after GVS. The score for item 12 of the revised Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part 3 was decreased in these patients.\nThe mechanism of postural instability is complex and not completely understood. In 2 out of the 5 patients, postural instability was not changed in response to GVS. Nonetheless, the GVS-induced change in postural instability for 3 patients in our study suggests that GVS might be a therapeutic option for postural instability.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is second only to Alzheimer's disease as the most common and debilitating age-associated neurodegenerative disorder. Currently, no therapy has been shown to unequivocally retard or arrest the progression of the disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of piperine on the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6\u2011tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's mouse model. For MPTP treatment, the animals received repeated intraperitoneal injections (i.p.) of MPTP (30 mg/kg) solution for 7 days. Piperine (10 mg/kg) was administered orally for 15 days including 8 days of pretreatment. Motor behavior analysis was conducted with the rotarod test. The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to assess the cognitive learning ability of the mice. A histological examination was subsequently conducted. The results ddemonstrate that piperine treatment attenuated MPTP-induced deficits in motor coordination and cognitive functioning. Piperine also prevented MPTP-induced decreases in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in the substantia nigra. Additionally, piperine reduced the number of activated microglia, expression of cytokine IL-1\u03b2, and oxidative stress following MPTP treatment. An anti-apoptotic property of piperine was identified by maintaining the balance of Bcl-2/Bax. In conclusion, the results show that piperine exerts a protective effect on dopaminergic neurons via antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory mechanisms in an MPTP-induced mouse model of PD. Thus, piperine is a potential therapeutic treatment for PD.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular \u03b1-synuclein has been proposed as a crucial mechanism for induction of pathological aggregate formation in previously healthy cells. In vitro, extracellular \u03b1-synuclein is partially associated with exosomal vesicles. Recently, we have provided evidence that exosomal \u03b1-synuclein is present in the central nervous system in vivo. We hypothesized that exosomal \u03b1-synuclein species from patients with \u03b1-synuclein related neurodegeneration serve as carriers for interneuronal disease transmission. We isolated exosomes from cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, progressive supranuclear palsy as a non-\u03b1-synuclein related disorder that clinically overlaps with Parkinson's disease, and neurological controls. Cerebrospinal fluid exosome numbers, \u03b1-synuclein protein content of cerebrospinal fluid exosomes and their potential to induce oligomerization of \u03b1-synuclein were analysed. The quantification of cerebrospinal fluid exosomal \u03b1-synuclein showed distinct differences between patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. In addition, exosomal \u03b1-synuclein levels correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment in cross-sectional samples from patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. Importantly, cerebrospinal fluid exosomes derived from Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies induce oligomerization of \u03b1-synuclein in a reporter cell line in a dose-dependent manner. Our data suggest that cerebrospinal fluid exosomes from patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies contain a pathogenic species of \u03b1-synuclein, which could initiate oligomerization of soluble \u03b1-synuclein in target cells and confer disease pathology.",

    "abstract": "To compare the accuracy of different neuropsychological tests and their combinations for deriving reliable cognitive indices for dementia diagnosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). One hundred forty consecutive patients with PD were recruited and administrated an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests. Discriminant analysis and receiver-operator characteristic curve were used to evaluate their correct classifications and validity. Patients with PD having dementia (PDD; 23.5%) performed significantly worse in all tests than patients without dementia. Age of onset, disease duration, Hoehn-Yahr grade, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III scores, and education were associated with dementia in patients with PD. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Block Design (BD) showed better specificity and sensitivity when used alone, and combined use of MMSE and BD further increased the validity. Our results indicated that the accuracy of MMSE was better in dementia diagnosis of Chinese patients with PD, and combined use of MMSE and BD could further increase the validity of dementia diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed features associated with a reduction in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in people with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). As a new approach, features were embedded in the WHO framework for measuring health and disability, the ICF model. From 609 articles screened, 114 articles were included. Features aligned with the ICF's body functions and structures domain (BFS) were investigated more often than personal features, activities of daily living, environmental factors, and participation in societal roles (95, 42, 35, 29 and 14 times, respectively). The strongest associations were found for the relationships between HRQoL and \"psychosocial functioning\" from the participation domain and HRQoL, and \"mobility limitations\" from the activities domain. For the BFS, non-motor symptoms were more closely associated with reduced HRQoL than motor symptoms. In conclusion, this systematic review (i) provides entirely new insights in the association of HRQoL with PD features, (ii) shows an imbalance between most extensively investigated and most relevant features for HRQoL, and (iii) demonstrates the usefulness of the ICF model for such an approach.",

    "abstract": "[Purpose] This study aimed to investigate the effect of treadmill exercise on non-motor function, specifically long-term memory, in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid-induced Parkinson's disease mouse model. [Methods] A mouse model of Parkinson's disease was developed by injecting 20\u2005mg/kg of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and 250\u2005mg/kg of probenecid (P). We divided in into four groups: probenecid group, probenecid-exercise group, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid group, and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid-exercise group. Mice in the exercise groups ran on treadmill for 30\u2005min/day, five times per week for 4 weeks. [Results] Latency in the passive avoidance test increased in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid-exercise group compared with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid group. In addition, the number of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine/NeuN-positive cells and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine/doublecortin-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was higher in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid-exercise group than that in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid group. These changes were associated with the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus. [Conclusion] Our results suggest that treadmill exercise may improve long-term memory in Parkinson's disease mice by facilitating neurogenesis via increased expression of neurotrophic factors.",

    "abstract": "A 59-year-old Caucasian man with a past history of Parkinson's disease (PD) status post-bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS), who also had treatment-resistant (TR) obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and treatment-resistant depression (TRD), presented for further evaluation and management of his TR OCD. After an unsuccessful attempt to treat his OCD by reprogramming his existing STN DBS, he was offered bilateral ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) DBS surgery. In addition to the expected improvement in OCD symptoms, he experienced significant improvement in both PD-related apathy and depression along with resolution of suicidal ideation. Furthermore, the patient's festinating gait dramatically improved. This case demonstrates that DBS of both the STN and VC/VS appears to have an initial signal of safety and tolerability. This is the first instance where both the STN and the VC/VS DBS targets have been implanted in an individual and the first case where a patient with PD has received additional DBS in mood-regulatory circuitry.",

    "abstract": "The similarities between dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and both Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are many and range from clinical presentation, to neuropathological characteristics, to more recently identified, genetic determinants of risk. Because of these overlapping features, diagnosing DLB is challenging and has clinical implications since some therapeutic agents that are applicable in other diseases have adverse effects in DLB. Having shown that DLB shares some genetic risk with PD and AD, we have now quantified the amount of sharing through the application of genetic correlation estimates, and show that, from a purely genetic perspective, and excluding the strong association at the APOE locus, DLB is equally correlated to AD and PD.",

    "abstract": "Since diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is mostly based on clinical criteria, it is almost impossible to formulate an early diagnosis, as well as a timely differential diagnosis versus other parkinsonisms. A great effort in searching reliable biomarkers both for early diagnosis and prognosis in PD is currently ongoing. Cerebrospinal fluid has been widely investigated as potential source for such biomarkers, with particular emphasis on \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) species. We reviewed all the clinical studies carried out so far on cerebrospinal fluid quantification of \u03b1-syn species in PD. Current evidence supports the value of total and oligomeric \u03b1-syn in PD diagnosis and in the differential diagnosis of PD and other parkinsonisms. Conversely, the role of \u03b1-syn species in PD prognosis remains unsatisfactory.",

    "abstract": "Objective. To determine the influence of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on daily routine driving behavior in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Methods. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was done in 121 DBS-PD patients. The influences of patient characteristics and DBS on current driving and driving at time of surgery and the predictive value of the preoperative levodopa-test on postoperative driving were evaluated. Results. 50% of 110 driving-license holders currently drove. 63.0% rated themselves as safe drivers, 39.4% reported improvement, and 10.9% noted deterioration in driving after DBS surgery. Inactive drivers had quit driving mainly due to disease burden (90.9%). Active drivers were younger, more often males, and less impaired according to H&Y and MMSE, had surgery more recently, and reported more often overall benefit from DBS. H&Y \"on\" and UPDRS III \"off\" scores at time of surgery were lower in pre- and postoperative active than in inactive drivers. Tremor and akinesia were less frequent reasons to quit driving after than before DBS surgery. Postoperatively, 22.7% (10/44) of patients restarted and 10.6% (7/66) of patients discontinued driving, independently of H&Y stage. The preoperative levodopa-test was not predictive for the postoperative driving outcome. Conclusion. 50% of PD patients with DBS drive. DBS surgery changes daily routine driving behavior.",

    "abstract": "There is lack of consistent evidence as to how well PD patients are able to accurately time their movements across space with an external acoustic signal. For years, research based on the finger-tapping paradigm, the most popular paradigm for exploring the brain's ability to time movement, has provided strong evidence that patients are not able to accurately reproduce an isochronous interval [i.e., Ref. (1)]. This was undermined by Spencer and Ivry (2) who suggested a specific deficit in temporal control linked to emergent, rhythmical movement not event-based actions, which primarily involve the cerebellum. In this study, we investigated motor timing of seven idiopathic PD participants in event-based sensorimotor synchronization task. Participants were asked to move their finger horizontally between two predefined target zones to synchronize with the occurrence of two sound events at two time intervals (1.5 and 2.5\u2009s). The width of the targets and the distance between them were manipulated to investigate impact of accuracy demands and movement amplitude on timing performance. The results showed that participants with PD demonstrated specific difficulties when trying to accurately synchronize their movements to a beat. The extent to which their ability to synchronize movement was compromised was found to be related to the severity of PD, but independent of the spatial constraints of the task.",

    "abstract": "Gait dysfunction is common in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Freezing of gait (FOG) is one such gait disturbance that significantly impacts mobility and quality of life in PD. Recent evidence suggests that cerebellar connectivity may differ in people with PD and FOG (PD+FOG) relative to those without FOG (PD-FOG). Investigation of gait adaptation, or the ability to change gait patterns in response to external perturbations, is cerebellum-dependent, is a practical means of probing cerebellar integrity and may provide additional insights regarding the FOG phenomenon.\nIn this study, we investigated gait adaptation in PD and FOG by measuring after-effects, namely whole-body rotation, following stepping on a rotating disc in PD+FOG compared to PD-FOG and older healthy adults. We refer to the period of stepping on the rotating disc as the podokinetic (PK) stimulation and after-effects as podokinetic after-rotation (PKAR). Our primary measure of adaptation was the magnitude and rate of decay of the after-effects.\nWe noted that PKAR was diminished in PD+FOG compared to the other groups, indicating reduced storage of the adapted gait pattern in PD+FOG. In the PD groups, FOG explained about 20% of the variability in peak velocity. Furthermore, these differences were independent of stepping cadence or motor sign severity.\nOur results show that gait adaptation is impaired in PD+FOG, suggesting the cerebellum may be differentially impacted in PD+FOG compared to PD-FOG. This supports previous neuroimaging evidence of cerebellar dysfunction in PD+FOG. Overall, these data further our understanding of gait deficits in PD+FOG.",

    "abstract": "Hyposmia is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, patients with PD are sometimes unaware of their olfactory dysfunction, resulting in an under-diagnosis of this symptom. To determine whether the loss of awareness of hyposmia results from cognitive impairment in patients with PD, we investigated the relationship between the degree of hyposmia self-awareness and the cognitive status of non-demented PD patients.\nThirty-one non-demented patients with PD and 20 healthy controls (HC) were assessed via a self-reported olfactory questionnaire and an odor identification test. PD patients were sub-classified as having mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) or as cognitively normal (PD-CN) (according to the current PD-MCI criteria). We compared the degree of hyposmia self-awareness between the PD-MCI and PD-CN groups.\nThe PD-MCI group scored the lowest on the odor identification test among all groups, whereas PD-MCI patients tended to rate their olfactory function higher on the self-reported olfactory questionnaire than PD-CN patients. Differences in the scores of subjective and objective olfactory measures between the PD-MCI and PD-CN groups were significant (p = 0.0069).\nThe loss of awareness of hyposmia is closely associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease may develop various non-motor symptoms during the course of the illness. Visual hallucinations (VH) and cognitive impairment (CI) are two common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Studies have reported association of both VH and CI with presence of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Presence of visual hallucinations and cognitive impairment has been described as risk factors for emergence of each other. There is marked overlap in the risk factors for development of RBD, VH and CI in patients with PD. Results of clinical and epidemiological studies as well as studies based on neuroimaging, electrophysiology especially transcranial magnetic stimulation and neuropsycholgical evaluations in PD patients have suggested presence of certain common neurobiological process leading to emergence of RBD, VH and CI. Structural neuroimaging studies using voxel-based morphometry have often reported grey matter atrophy of hippocampus and parahippocampal cortices in PD patients with RBD, VH and CI. Cholinergic dysfunction is common in PD patients with RBD, VH and CI. This review explores the complex interactions of RBD, VH and CI in patients with PD and their potential implications.",

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of rest tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD) is not well understood, and its severity does not correlate with the severity of other cardinal signs of PD. We hypothesized that tremor-related oscillatory activity in the basal-ganglia-thalamocortical loop might serve as a compensatory mechanism for the excessive beta band synchronization associated with the parkinsonian state. We recorded electrocorticography (ECoG) from the sensorimotor cortex and local field potentials (LFP) from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients undergoing lead implantation for deep brain stimulation (DBS). We analyzed differences in measures of network synchronization during epochs of spontaneous rest tremor, versus epochs without rest tremor, occurring in the same subjects. The presence of tremor was associated with reduced beta power in the cortex and STN. Cortico-cortical coherence and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) decreased during rest tremor, as did basal ganglia-cortical coherence in the same frequency band. Cortical broadband gamma power was not increased by tremor onset, in contrast to the movement-related gamma increase typically observed at the onset of voluntary movement. These findings suggest that the cortical representation of rest tremor is distinct from that of voluntary movement, and support a model in which tremor acts to decrease beta band synchronization within the basal ganglia-cortical loop.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the socioeconomic systems supporting outpatients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in Japan.\nThe study was performed in 2013 at two private hospitals and one clinic in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. A survey was conducted with 248 consecutive PD patients, and the data from 237 PD outpatients were analyzed after excluding 11 patients who did not meet inclusion criteria. Monthly medical and transportation payments as a PD outpatient were selected as outcome variables, and their association with various explanatory variables, such as utilization of support systems for PD outpatients, were evaluated using logistic regression model analysis.\nAfter controlling for potential confounding variables, the utilization of the system providing financial aid for treatment for patients with intractable disease was significantly inversely associated with monthly medical payment among PD outpatients (OR 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22-0.95). Experience of hospital admission for PD treatment was significantly positively associated with monthly transportation payment (OR 4.74; 95% CI, 2.18-10.32). Monthly medical payment was also significantly positively associated with monthly transportation payment (OR 4.01; 95% CI, 2.23-7.51).\nUse of Japanese public financial support systems may be associated with reductions in medical payments for PD outpatients. However, those systems may not have supported transportation payments, and higher transportation payments may be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization.\n\u65e5\u672c\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30d1\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30bd\u30f3\u75c5\u306e\u5916\u6765\u901a\u9662\u60a3\u8005\u3092\u652f\u63f4\u3059\u308b\u793e\u4f1a\u7d4c\u6e08\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u3092\u8a55\u4fa1\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u65ad\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u3092\u884c\u3063\u305f\u3002\n\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u306f\u30012013\u5e74\u306b\u5317\u6d77\u9053\u5185\u306e2\u3064\u306e\u75c5\u9662\u30681\u3064\u306e\u8a3a\u7642\u6240\u3067\u5b9f\u65bd\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u9023\u7d9a\u62bd\u51fa\u3057\u305f248\u4eba\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30bd\u30f3\u75c5\u306e\u5916\u6765\u901a\u9662\u60a3\u8005\u306b\u5bfe\u3057\u3066\u8abf\u67fb\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u3001\u9664\u5916\u57fa\u6e96\u306b\u8a72\u5f53\u3057\u305f11\u3092\u9664\u304f237\u4eba\u306e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u304c\u89e3\u6790\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u6bce\u6708\u306e\u901a\u9662\u533b\u7642\u8cbb\u3001\u304a\u3088\u3073\u3001\u6bce\u6708\u306e\u901a\u9662\u4ea4\u901a\u8cbb\u3092\u76ee\u7684\u5909\u6570\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u30d1\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30bd\u30f3\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u3092\u652f\u63f4\u3059\u308b\u5236\u5ea6\u306a\u3069\u306e\u7a2e\u3005\u306a\u8aac\u660e\u5909\u6570\u3068\u306e\u95a2\u9023\u6027\u3092\u30ed\u30b8\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u56de\u5e30\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u5206\u6790\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u691c\u8a0e\u3057\u3001\u30aa\u30c3\u30ba\u6bd4\uff08OR\uff09\u3068\u305d\u306e95%\u4fe1\u983c\u533a\u9593\uff0895%CI\uff09\u3092\u7b97\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\u4ea4\u7d61\u8981\u56e0\u3068\u306a\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u306e\u3042\u308b\u5909\u6570\u3092\u8abf\u6574\u3057\u305f\u89e3\u6790\u3067\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u75be\u60a3\u533b\u7642\u8cbb\u52a9\u6210\u5236\u5ea6\u306e\u5229\u7528\u3068\u901a\u9662\u533b\u7642\u8cbb\u3068\u306e\u9593\u306b\u3001\u6709\u610f\u306a\u8ca0\u306e\u95a2\u9023\u304c\u307f\u3089\u308c\u305f\uff08OR=0.46, 95%CI 0.22-0.95, P=0.035\uff09\u3002\u5165\u9662\u306e\u7d4c\u9a13\u3068\u901a\u9662\u4ea4\u901a\u8cbb\u3068\u306e\u9593\u306b\u3001\u6709\u610f\u306a\u6b63\u306e\u95a2\u9023\u304c\u307f\u3089\u308c\u305f\uff08OR=4.74, 95%CI 2.18-10.32, P<0.001\uff09\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u901a\u9662\u533b\u7642\u8cbb\u3068\u901a\u9662\u4ea4\u901a\u8cbb\u3068\u306e\u9593\u306b\u3001\u6709\u610f\u306a\u6b63\u306e\u95a2\u9023\u304c\u307f\u3089\u308c\u305f\uff08OR=4.01, 95%CI 2.23-7.51, P<0.001\uff09\u3002\n\u30d1\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3\u30bd\u30f3\u75c5\u306e\u60a3\u8005\u306e\u901a\u9662\u533b\u7642\u8cbb\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u516c\u7684\u306a\u7d4c\u6e08\u7684\u652f\u63f4\u5236\u5ea6\u306f\u3001\u60a3\u8005\u306e\u901a\u9662\u533b\u7642\u8cbb\u306e\u8ca0\u62c5\u8efd\u6e1b\u3068\u95a2\u9023\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u793a\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3089\u306e\u5236\u5ea6\u306f\u60a3\u8005\u306e\u901a\u9662\u4ea4\u901a\u8cbb\u306e\u8ca0\u62c5\u8efd\u6e1b\u3068\u306f\u95a2\u9023\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\u305d\u3057\u3066\u3001\u901a\u9662\u4ea4\u901a\u8cbb\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u3053\u3068\u306f\u5165\u9662\u3059\u308b\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u3068\u95a2\u9023\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u793a\u5506\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3002",

    "abstract": "Data on predictors of decline in PD are largely based on de-novo populations and limited to the use of motor outcomes that fail to capture the full scope of disease.\nDetermine the clinical predictors of decline in early treated PD using a novel multi-domain measure.\nData from NINDS Exploratory Trials in PD Long-Term Study 1 (NET-PD LS1), a multicenter Phase 3 study of creatine in early treated PD, were analyzed. Functional decline was defined by a global outcome metric (GO) that consisted of: Schwab and England ADL scale, PD 39-item Questionnaire, Unified PD Rating Scale, Ambulatory Capacity Score, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, and Modified Rankin Scale. Univariate and multivariate models were used to test the association of predictors of interest with a standardized rank-sum of the GO.\n765 of 1741 participants completed five-year assessments and were included. Older age at disease onset (p\u200a< \u200a0.0001), higher baseline levodopa equivalent dose (p\u200a=\u200a0.01), and worse Scales for Outcomes of Parkinson's Disease Cognition score (p\u200a=\u200a0.001) at baseline were the strongest predictors of functional decline in multivariate analysis. PD symptom subtype was not a significant predictor of outcome (p\u200a=\u200a0.42). The full model was only a modest predictor of change in GO (R2\u200a=\u200a0.186).\nThis is the largest study to systematically assess predictors of functional decline in early treated PD over several years, and the first to use a multi-domain outcome measure of decline. Older age at disease onset and worse cognition, and not PD subtype, were predictors of decline.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing body of evidence linking mitochondrial dysfunction, mediated either through inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation or mitochondrial proteomic deficit, to Parkinson's disease (PD). Yet, despite this, the role of somatic mtDNA point mutations and specifically point-mutational burden in PD is poorly understood. Here, we take advantage of recent technical and methodological advances to examine the role of age-related and acquired mtDNA mutation in the largest study of mtDNA in postmortem PD tissue to date. Our data show that PD patients suffer an increase in mtDNA mutational burden in, but no limited to, the substantia nigra pars compacta when compared to matched controls. This mutational burden appears increased in genes encoding cytochrome c oxidase, supportive of previous protein studies of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD. Accepting experimental limitations, our study confirms the important role of age-related mtDNA point mutation in the etiology of PD, moreover, by analyzing 2 distinct brain regions, we are able to show that PD patient brains are more vulnerable to mtDNA mutation overall.",

    "abstract": "Recently, several CHCHD2 mutations were reported to be associated with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD) in a Japanese population. However, an association between CHCHD2 and PD was not observed in 2 Caucasian data sets. The present study searched for CHCHD2 coding variants in Canadian PD patients. Sanger sequencing of all CHCHD2 exons revealed no coding mutations in 155 familial cases. Moreover, 3 coding CHCHD2 polymorphisms available on the NeuroX array (Pro2Leu, Pro14Ser, and Ile118Met) were homozygous for the major allele in an additional 85 PD patients. Our study suggests that CHCHD2 mutations may not account for PD in Canadian patients.",

    "abstract": "Like any organ, the brain is susceptible to the march of time and a reduction in mitochondrial biogenesis is a hallmark of the aging process. In the largest investigation of mitochondrial copy number in Parkinson's disease (PD) to date and by using multiple tissues, we demonstrate that reduced Parkinson DNA (mitochondrial DNA mtDNA) copy number is a biomarker for the etiology of PD. We used established methods of mtDNA quantification to assess the copy number of mtDNA in n\u00a0= 363 peripheral blood samples, n\u00a0= 151 substantia nigra pars compacta tissue samples and n\u00a0= 120 frontal cortex tissue samples from community-based PD cases fulfilling UK-PD Society brain bank criteria for the diagnosis of PD. Accepting technical limitations, our data show that PD patients suffer a significant reduction in mtDNA copy number in both peripheral blood and the vulnerable substantia nigra pars compacta when compared to matched controls. Our study indicates that reduced mtDNA copy number is restricted to the affected brain tissue, but is also reflected in the peripheral blood, suggesting that mtDNA copy number may be a viable diagnostic predictor of PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work was to utilize meta-analysis in examining the effects of memantine on neuropsychological functioning in patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).\nIncluded studies fulfilled these criteria: included objective cognitive measures, a comparison group of participants not taking memantine, and provided sufficient data for calculation of effect size. We examined effect sizes across global cognition and five specific neuropsychological domains. Moderator variables examined included neuropsychological domain, diagnostic cohort (PDD, DLB, or mixed PDD-DLB cohort), study design (open label or placebo-controlled), and trial length.\nSix publications met inclusion criteria totaling 57 effects. Homogeneity analysis across cognitive domains revealed a small overall effect size (\nThe present study indicates that effect-size heterogeneity across studies of memantine in DLB and PDD patients is moderated by diagnostic makeup of the cohort and study design. The small overall effect size noted in placebo-controlled trials versus open-label trials indicates that memantine has minimal effects on cognition in PDD and DLB and is unlikely to demonstrate clinically significant improvements in cognition.",

    "abstract": "Background. Parkinson's disease (PD) is mostly characterized by alpha-synuclein (SNCA) aggregation and loss of nigrostriatal dopamine-containing neurons. In this study a novel SNCA multiplication is described in two siblings affected by severe parkinsonism featuring early onset dyskinesia, psychiatric symptoms, and cognitive deterioration. Methods. SNCA dosage was performed using High-Density Comparative Genomic Hybridization Array (CGH-Array), Multiple Ligation Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), and Quantitative PCR (qPCR). Genetic analysis was associated with clinical evaluation. Results. Genetic analysis of siblings showed for the first time a 351\u2009Kb triplication containing SNCA gene along with 6 exons of MMRN1 gene in 4q22.1 and a duplication of 1,29\u2009Mb of a genomic region flanking the triplication. Conclusions. The identification of this family indicates a novel mechanism of SNCA gene multiplication, which confirms the genomic instability in this region and provides data on the genotype-phenotype correlation in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa therapy alleviates the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), but long-term treatment often leads to motor complications such as levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID).\nTo explore the neuronal activity in the basal ganglia nuclei in patients with PD and LID.\nThirty patients with idiopathic PD (age, 55.1 \u00b1 11.0 years; disease duration, 8.7 \u00b1 5.6 years) were enrolled between August 2006 and August 2013 at the Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, China. Their Hoehn and Yahr (1967) scores ranged from 2-4 and their UPDRS III scores were 28.5 \u00b1 5.2. Fifteen of them had severe LID (UPDRS IV scores of 6.7 \u00b1 1.6). Microelectrode recording was performed in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) during pallidotomy (n = 12) or STN deep brain stimulation (DBS; bilateral, n = 12; unilateral, n = 6). The firing patterns and frequencies of various cell types were analyzed by assessing single cell interspike intervals (ISIs) and the corresponding coefficient of variation (CV).\nA total of 295 neurons were identified from the GPi (n = 12) and STN (n = 18). These included 26 (8.8%) highly grouped discharge, 30 (10.2%) low frequency firing, 78 (26.4%) rapid tonic discharge, 103 (34.9%) irregular activity, and 58 (19.7%) tremor-related activity. There were significant differences between the two groups (p < 0.05) for neurons with irregular firing, highly irregular cluster-like firing, and low-frequency firing.\nAltered neuronal activity was observed in the basal ganglia nucleus of GPi and STN, and may play important roles in the pathophysiology of PD and LID.",

    "abstract": "The nonmotor symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease (PD) are important factors for quality of life (QoL). Few studies on NMS have been conducted in Asian PD patients. Additionally, effects of anti-PD drugs on risk of NMS are still controversial. We therefore conducted this hospital-based cross-sectional study to examine the clinical factors, including concomitant anti-PD medication use, on the occurrence of NMS and QoL in Taiwanese PD patients.\nPD patients who received long-term follow-up in the movement disorders clinics were enrolled and received NMS questionnaire (NMSQuest) and the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was checked for the correlation between clinical factors and NMSQT/PDQSI. Multiple linear regressions were applied to assess the influence of clinical factors on NMSQT/PDQSI.\nA total of 210 PD patients (mean age 66.1\u00b19.86 years, Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.2\u00b10.9) were included in this study. Up to 98% of patients reported at least one symptom of NMS. The most prevalent symptom was urinary complaints (56%), followed by memory/apathy (30%) and depression/anxiety (28%). The correlation between NMSQT and PDQSI was strong (r s=0.667), especially the item of depression/anxiety (r s=0.607). The regression model for NMSQT indicated that disease duration and severity, but not pharmacological therapy, were major predictors of NMS.\nOur data indicated a high prevalence rate of NMS in PD patients. Among symptoms of NMS, depression and anxiety had the greatest impact on QoL. Concomitant anti-PD medication use did not affect the occurrence of NMS and QoL.",

    "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy is an established means to improve function in a variety of psychiatric and neurologic conditions, particularly for patients who remain treatment-refractory. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that sometimes does not respond well to conventional pharmacotherapies. Reports have indicated that electroconvulsive therapy may be an effective and safe treatment for those patients with Parkinson's disease who are not optimally responding to first-line treatments. Despite these reports, however, electroconvulsive therapy is not often used by clinicians in patients with treatment-resistant Parkinson's disease, perhaps due to stigma, lack of knowledge regarding its safety and efficacy, and/or inability to predict the duration of therapeutic benefit.\nOur objective was to determine if the available literature on ECT supports it as a safe and effective treatment option in patients with treatment-refractory Parkinson's disease.\nMotoric improvement induced by electroconvulsive therapy has been documented for decades in persons with Parkinson's disease. Efficacy and safety are reported following electroconvulsive therapy in people with Parkinson's disease who have sub-optimal response to medicines or experience the \"on/off\" phenomenon to L-dopa. Electroconvulsive therapy is an effective option for acute and maintenance treatment of Parkinson's disease in select patients. Inability to predict how long the beneficial effects of ECT therapy will last in patients with Parkinson's disease may be a reason why this treatment is underutilized by clinicians. More research is warranted to clarify parameters for application and duration of therapeutic benefit in individuals with difficult-to-treat Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is frequent in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently proposed criteria for MCI in PD (PD-MCI) indicate level I diagnosis based on abbreviated assessment and level II based on comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. The study explored the sensitivity and specificity of the Italian versions of three neuropsychological tests for level I diagnosis of PD-MCI. We recruited 100 consecutive PD patients. After screening for inclusion criteria, 43 patients were included. The sensitivity and specificity of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R) in comparison to level II diagnosis of PD-MCI were examined. PD-MCI was diagnosed (level II) in 51% of patients. Disease duration was significantly longer and PD motor scales were more severely impaired in MCI group. The receiver-operator characteristics curve documented nonsignificant difference in the performance of the three tests, with slight advantage of MMSE (corrected data). The time of administration favored MMSE. In Italian-speaking PD patients, MMSE might represent a good screening tool for PD-MCI, because of the shorter time of administration and the performance comparable to those of MoCA and ACE-R. Further studies are needed to validate the new PD-MCI criteria across different languages and cultures.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this work was to determine whether the differences of serum miRNAs profiling could distinguish PD patients from healthy individuals.\nWe collected serum samples from 106 sporadic PD patients and 91 age/gender-matched healthy controls. Serum miRNAs were analysed by Solexa sequencing followed by a qRT-PCR examination. The qRT-PCR assay, which was divided into two phases, was used to validate the expression of miRNAs screened by Solexa sequencing. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and clustering analysis were performed to determine the diagnostic usefulness of the selected miRNAs for PD.\nIn this study, we generated a profile of 5 serum miRNAs: miR-195 was up-regulated, and miR-185, miR-15b, miR-221 and miR-181a were down-regulated.\nThis group of five miRNAs can precisely distinguish PD patients from health individuals and may be used as a potential serum-based biomarker for the diagnosis of PD.",

In case 1, aripiprazole was administered as a psychiatric treatment. It proved to be effective in AEO with blepharospasm. In case 2 and case 3, the patients experienced AEO without blepharospasm, and a significant improvement was observed after aripiprazole treatment. In this study, the aripiprazole dosage ranged between 3 and 9 mg/day. This is the first report of aripiprazole as a potentially effective treatment for AEO in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Pupil size is an easy-to-measure, non-invasive method to index various cognitive processes. Although a growing number of studies have incorporated measures of pupil size into clinical investigation, there have only been limited studies in Parkinson's disease (PD). Convergent evidence has suggested PD patients exhibit cognitive impairment at or soon after diagnosis. Here, we used an interleaved pro- and anti-saccade paradigm while monitoring pupil size with saccadic eye movements to examine the relationship between executive function deficits and pupil size in PD patients. Subjects initially fixated a central cue, the color of which instructed them to either look at a peripheral stimulus automatically (pro-saccade) or suppress the automatic response and voluntarily look in the opposite direction of the stimulus (anti-saccade). We hypothesized that deficits of voluntary control should be revealed not only on saccadic but also on pupil responses because of the recently suggested link between the saccade and pupil control circuits. In elderly controls, pupil size was modulated by task preparation, showing larger dilation prior to stimulus appearance in preparation for correct anti-saccades, compared to correct pro-saccades, or erroneous pro-saccades made in the anti-saccade condition. Moreover, the size of pupil dilation correlated negatively with anti-saccade reaction times. However, this profile of pupil size modulation was significantly blunted in PD patients, reflecting dysfunctional circuits for anti-saccade preparation. Our results demonstrate disruptions of modulated pupil responses by voluntary movement preparation in PD patients, highlighting the potential of using low-cost pupil size measurement to examine executive function deficits in early PD.",

    "abstract": "The moderate and severe stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) are marked by motor and non-motor complications that still remain difficult to control with the currently available therapy. Adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists target non-dopaminergic systems, and have emerged as promising add-on therapy in the management of PD, a little more than a decade ago. While the development of this new drug class was slower than initially expected, istradefylline was recently registered in Japan, because it provides reduction of the off-time, when given in association with levodopa. Effects on some non-motor features have also been suggested, and preliminary studies further suggest a potential neuroprotective effect. Associations of A(2A) receptor antagonists with dopaminergic agents, as well as enzyme blockers like catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, should provide even greater benefit in advanced PD patients, and, thus, a more individualized treatment approach would be at hand.",

    "abstract": "Preclinical and clinical studies have previously shown that systemic administration of GM1 ganglioside has neuroprotective and neurorestorative properties in Parkinson's disease (PD) models and in PD patients. However, the clinical development of GM1 for PD has been hampered by its animal origin (GM1 used in previous studies was extracted from bovine brains), limited bioavailability, and limited blood brain barrier penetrance following systemic administration.\nTo assess an alternative therapeutic approach to systemic administration of brain-derived GM1 to enhance GM1 levels in the brain via enzymatic conversion of polysialogangliosides into GM1 and to assess the neuroprotective potential of this approach.\nWe used sialidase from Vibrio cholerae (VCS) to convert GD1a, GD1b and GT1b gangliosides to GM1. VCS was infused by osmotic minipump into the dorsal third ventricle in mice over a 4-week period. After the first week of infusion, animals received MPTP injections (20 mg/kg, s.c., twice daily, 4 hours apart, for 5 consecutive days) and were euthanized 2 weeks after the last injection.\nVCS infusion resulted in the expected change in ganglioside expression with a significant increase in GM1 levels. VCS-treated animals showed significant sparing of striatal dopamine (DA) levels and substantia nigra DA neurons following MPTP administration, with the extent of sparing of DA neurons similar to that achieved with systemic GM1 administration.\nThe results suggest that enzymatic conversion of polysialogangliosides to GM1 may be a viable treatment strategy for increasing GM1 levels in the brain and exerting a neuroprotective effect on the damaged nigrostriatal DA system.",

To examine the gray matter changes in patients with Parkinson's disease and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using voxel based Morphometry (VBM).\nMagnetic resonance images were obtained from 35 patients with PD and 20 age and sex-matched healthy control subjects. In the PD group, 14 subjects had no MCI and 21 had MCI. MRI 3D structural images were acquired and analyzed by means of the optimized VBM procedure with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM5).\nWidespread areas of cortical atrophy were found in patients with PD compared with normal controls (in both temporal, occipital, parietal, frontal lobes and right limbic lobes, posterior lobes of the cerebellum and left caudate nucleus). Gray matter reductions were found in bilateral fusiform gyrus and lingual gyrus, left anterior cingulate cortex and insula, and right superior temporal gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex, central gyrus and precuneus in patients with PD with MCI compared with normal controls. Inpatients with PD with MCI, areas of reduced gray matter were found in both precentral gyrus and middle temporal gyrus, right cuneus, precuneus, and orbitofrontal cortex, and left fusiform gyrus compared with those without MCI.\nThese findings suggest that PD is associated with the gray matter atrophy in the neocortical areas, and that cognitive impairment in patients with PD may be associated with gray matter changes in the parieto-occipital association cortex, right orbitofrontal cortex, and middle temporal gyrus.",

Resting state fMRI and structural MRI data were acquired. The resting state brain activity was measured by the regional homogeneity (ReHo) method and the grey matter (GM) volume was attained by the voxel-based morphology (VBM) analysis. Two-sample t-test was then performed to detect the group differences with structural atrophy as a covariate.\nVBM analysis showed GM volume reductions in the left superior frontal gyrus, left paracentral lobule, and left middle frontal gyrus in PD patients as compared to NC. There were widespread ReHo differences between NC and PD patients. Compared to NC, PD patients showed significant alterations in the motor network, including decreased ReHo in the right primary sensory cortex (S1), while increased ReHo in the left premotor area (PMA) and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In addition, a cluster in the left superior occipital gyrus (SOG) also showed increased ReHo in PD patients.\nThe current findings indicate that significant changes of ReHo in the motor and non-motor cortices have been detected in PD patients, independent of age, gender, education level, and structural atrophy. The present study thus suggests ReHo abnormalities as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of PD and further provides insights into the biological mechanism of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Our recent study has indicated that a moderate lesion induced by bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injections into the ventrolateral region of the caudate-putamen (CP) in rats, modeling preclinical stages of Parkinson's disease, induces a \"depressive-like\" behavior which is reversed by chronic treatment with pramipexole (PRA). The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of the above lesion and chronic PRA treatment on binding to the serotonin transporter (SERT) in different brain regions. As before, 6-OHDA (15 \u03bcg/2.5 \u03bcl) was administered bilaterally into the CP. PRA (1mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously twice a day for 2 weeks. Serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons of the dorsal raphe (DR) were immunostained for tryptophan hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase, respectively, and were counted stereologically. Binding of [(3)H]GBR 12,935 to the dopamine transporter (DAT) and [(3)H]citalopram to SERT was analyzed autoradiographically. Intrastriatal 6-OHDA injections decreased the number of dopaminergic, but not serotonergic neurons in the DR. 6-OHDA reduced the DAT binding in the CP, and SERT binding in the nigrostriatal system (CP, substantia nigra (SN)), limbic system (ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAC), amygdala, prefrontal cortex (PFCX), habenula, hippocampus) and DR. A significant positive correlation was found between DAT and SERT binding in the CP. Chronic PRA did not influence DAT binding but reduced SERT binding in the above structures, and deepened the lesion-induced losses in the core region of the NAC, SN, VTA and PFCX. The present study indicates that both the lesion of dopaminergic neurons and chronic PRA administration induce adaptive down-regulation of SERT binding. Moreover, although involvement of stimulation of dopaminergic transmission by chronic PRA in its \"antidepressant\" effect seems to be prevalent, additional contribution of SERT inhibition cannot be excluded.",

    "abstract": "Involuntary central oscillations at single and double tremor frequencies drive the peripheral neuromechanical system of muscles and joints to cause tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD). The central signal of double tremor frequency was found to correlate more directly to individual muscle EMGs (Timmermann et al. 2003). This study is aimed at investigating what central components of oscillation contribute to inter-muscular synchronization in a group of upper extremity muscles during tremor in PD patients.\n11 idiopathic, tremor dominant PD subjects participated in this study. Joint kinematics during tremor in the upper extremity was recorded along with EMGs of six upper arm muscles using a novel experimental apparatus. The apparatus provided support for the upper extremity on a horizontal surface with reduced friction, so that resting tremor in the arm can be recorded with a MotionMonitor II system. In each subject, the frequencies of rhythmic firings in upper arm muscles were determined using spectral analysis. Paired and pool-averaged coherence analyses of EMGs for the group of muscles were performed to correlate the level of inter-muscular synchronization to tremor amplitudes at shoulder and elbow. The phase shift between synchronized antagonistic muscle pairs was calculated to aid coherence analysis in the muscle pool.\nRecorded EMG revealed that rhythmic firings were present in most recorded muscles, which were either synchronized to form phase-locked bursting cycles at a subject specific frequency, or unsynchronized with a random phase distribution. Paired coherence showed a stronger synchronization among a subset of recorded arm muscles at tremor frequency than that at double tremor frequency. Furthermore, the number of synchronized muscles in the arm was positively correlated to tremor amplitudes at elbow and shoulder. Pool-averaged coherence at tremor frequency also showed a better correlation with the amplitude of resting tremor than that of double tremor frequency, indicating that the neuromechanical coupling in peripheral neuromuscular system was stronger at tremor frequency.\nBoth paired and pool-averaged coherences are more consistent indexes to correlate to tremor intensity in a group of upper extremity muscles of PD patients. The central drive at tremor frequency contributes mainly to synchronize peripheral muscles in the modulation of tremor intensity.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD, OMIM 168600) is a neurodegenerative disorder featured by degeneration of melanin-positive dopaminergic neurons. Epidemiologic studies have suggested that PD and malignant melanoma (MM) might share common genetic components. Recently, the p.R160W variant in the melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R, OMIM 155555), a risk factor for MM, has been identified to be associated with PD in Spanish population. To explore whether the MC1R variants are associated with sporadic PD in Chinese population, we designed a case-control comparison study and studied three variants, including rs3212366 (p.F196L), rs33932559 (p.I120T) and rs34090186 (p.R67Q), in the MC1R gene in 512 Chinese Han patients with sporadic PD and 512 age, gender and ethnicity matched normal controls. For rs3212366, only the TT genotype was identified in both PD and control cohorts. For variants rs33932559 and rs34090186, we did not identify any statistically significant difference in either genotypic distribution or allelic distribution between the PD cohort and control cohort, and in addition, we did not identify any related haplotype that would either increase the risk for PD or play a protective role against PD. Our data suggest that none of the three variants of the MC1R gene and related haplotypes be associated with sporadic form of PD in Chinese Han population from Mainland China.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine and glutamate are crucial neurotransmitters in Parkinson disease (PD). While recent large meta-analyses reported that genetic variation of dopamine (DRD2, DRD3) and glutamine (NMDA, GRIN2B) neurotransmitter receptors was not associated with PD risk, they could conceivably influence PD phenotype. We studied the association of these receptor polymorphisms relating to PD age of onset.\nThere were 664 PD patients and 718 controls, all Caucasian, with stored DNA at Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida. Genotyping was performed for DRD2 (Taq 1A, rs1800497), DRD3 (rs6280), and NMDA (GRIN2B, rs7301328) polymorphisms with ABI Taqman assays. Single nucleotide polymorphism associations with age of onset were evaluated using dominant, recessive, and additive genotypic models.\nDRD3 variant carriers had an approximate 4.4-year decrease in mean age of onset when both copies of the minor allele were present (P = 0.0034) and an approximate 1.5-year decrease in mean age at onset for every additional minor allele (P = 0.023) (recessive and additive models, respectively). There was no association with age of onset for DRD2 or GRIN2B under any statistical model (all P \u2265 0.22).\nThe DRD3 (rs6280) polymorphism, but not DRD2 (Taq1A) or GRIN2B, influences younger PD age of onset in the US Caucasian population. Validation of these findings in larger studies with other ethnic groups is indicated.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction and neuropsychological symptoms like depression and anhedonia are common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). The assessment of both functional domains includes clinical examination, olfactory testing, and standardized questionnaires. While olfaction is readily assessed by functional tests, the distinction of anhedonia as a separate symptom from other depressive symptoms is challenging. Thus, a test focusing on the assessment of hedonic olfaction may be helpful in the assessment of neuropsychological symptoms in PD.\nWe examined anhedonia by evaluating the perception of pleasantness of odors in PD patients (n = 57) and healthy controls (n = 46). Pleasantness of odors was registered on a visual 9-point scale. For the assessment of anhedonia we used the Snaith-Hamilton-Pleasure-Scale (SHAPS). Depression was evaluated with the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory II.\nPD patients showed a substantial reduction in hedonic olfaction compared to controls (hedonic score: 1.5 vs. 2.2). Hyposmia, one of the most prevalent non-motor symptoms in PD, was a confounding factor. However, even normosmic PD patients showed a reduced hedonic olfaction compared to controls (hedonic score: 1.6 vs. 2.2). Furthermore, we observed a correlation between hedonic olfaction and the SHAPS-score for PD patients even though positive SHAPS-rating was observed in 9% of PD patients only, while no correlation to depression was present.\nThese findings suggest that reduced hedonic olfaction might be an additional neuropsychological feature, probably giving insights into changes in hedonic tone complementary to hyposmia and depression in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is classified as a motor disorder, but most patients develop cognitive impairment, and eventual dementia (PDD). Predictive neurobiomarkers may be useful in the identification of those patients at imminent risk of PDD. Given the compromised cerebral integrity in PDD, we investigated whether brain metabolites track disease progression over time.\nProton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) was used to identify brain metabolic changes associated with cognitive impairment and dementia in PD. Forty-nine healthy participants and 130 PD patients underwent serial single voxel proton MRS and neuropsychological testing. At baseline patients were classified as either having normal cognitive status (PDN, n = 77), mild cognitive impairment (PDMCI, n = 33), or dementia (PDD, n = 20). Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) was examined to quantify N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and myo-inositol (mI). A hierarchical Bayesian model was used to assess whether cognitive ability and other covariates were related to baseline MRS values and changes in MRS over time.\nAt baseline, relative to controls, PDD had significantly decreased NAA/Cr and increased Cho/Cr. However, these differences did not remain significant after accounting for age, sex, and MDS-UPDRS III. At follow-up, no significant changes in MRS metabolite ratios were detected, with no relationship found between MRS measures and change in cognitive status.\nUnlike Alzheimer's disease, single voxel MR spectroscopy of the PCC failed to show any significant association with cognitive status at baseline or over time. This suggests that MRS of PCC is not a clinically useful biomarker for tracking or predicting cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, resulting in motor dysfunctions. While most PD is sporadic in nature, a significant subset can be linked to either autosomal dominant or recessive mutations. PARK2, encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase, parkin, is the most frequently mutated gene in autosomal recessive early onset PD. It has recently been reported that PD-associated gene products such as PINK1, \u03b1-synuclein, LRRK2, and DJ-1, as well as parkin associate with lipid rafts, suggesting that the dysfunction of these proteins in lipid rafts may be a causal factor of PD. Therefore here, we examined the relationship between lipid rafts-related proteins and parkin.\nWe identified caveolin-1 (cav-1), which is one of the major constituents of lipid rafts at the plasma membrane, as a substrate of parkin. Loss of parkin function was found to disrupt the ubiquitination and degradation of cav-1, resulting in elevated cav-1 protein level in cells. Moreover, the total cholesterol level and membrane fluidity was altered by parkin deficiency, causing dysregulation of lipid rafts-dependent endocytosis. Further, cell-to-cell transmission of \u03b1-synuclein was facilitated by parkin deficiency.\nOur results demonstrate that alterations in lipid rafts by the loss of parkin via cav-1 may be a causal factor of PD, and cav-1 may be a novel therapeutic target for PD.",

    "abstract": "Long-term levodopa therapy and related fluctuating plasma concentrations are associated with between-dose periods of 'off time' resulting in substantial variation in symptoms and functioning throughout the day in people with Parkinson's (PwP).\nPwP across UK, France, Spain and Italy completed an online survey to explore: the impact of 'off time' on (1) health-related quality of life (HRQL) and (2) on functioning and ability to undertake usual activities; (3) the value of 'off time' relative to other factors associated with Parkinson's through a stated preference discrete choice experiment (SPDCE).\nIn total, 305 PwP completed the online survey. Overall mean HRQL (utility) score was significantly lower for 'off time' (0.37) than for 'on time' (0.60). All attributes within the SPDCE were significant predictors of treatment choice, although increased duration of 'on time' (per hour per day: odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a01.40) and predictability of 'off time' to within 30\u00a0min (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.42) were valued most highly.\n'On time' and predictability of 'off time' are highly valued by PwP. Due to substantial diurnal variation of Parkinson's symptoms, standard patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments may not adequately capture the impact of 'off time' on HRQL and participation in daily activities.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons with an accompanying neuroinflammation leading to loss of dopamine in the basal ganglia. Caffeine, a well-known A2A receptor antagonist is reported to slow down the neuroinflammation caused by activated microglia and reduce the extracellular glutamate in the brain. In this study, we have evaluated the neuroprotective effect of caffeine in the MPTP model of PD by monitoring the region specific cerebral energy metabolism. Adult C57BL6 mice were treated with caffeine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min prior to MPTP (25 mg/kg, i.p.) administration for 8 days. The paw grip strength of mice was assessed in order to evaluate the motor function after various treatments. For metabolic studies, mice were infused with [1,6-(13)C2]glucose, and (13)C labeling of amino acids was monitored using ex vivo(1)H-[(13)C]-NMR spectroscopy. The paw grip strength was found to be reduced following the MPTP treatment. The caffeine pretreatment showed significant protection against the reduction of paw grip strength in MPTP treated mice. The levels of GABA and myo-inositol were found to be elevated in the striatum of MPTP treated mice. The (13)C labeling of GluC4, GABAC2 and GlnC4 from [1,6-(13)C2]glucose was decreased in the cerebral cortex, striatum, olfactory bulb, thalamus and cerebellum suggesting impaired glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal activity and neurotransmission of the MPTP treated mice. Most interestingly, the pretreatment of caffeine maintained the (13)C labeling of amino acids to the control values in cortical, olfactory bulb and cerebellum regions while it partially retained in striatal and thalamic regions in MPTP treated mice. The pretreatment of caffeine provides a partial neuro-protection against severe striatal degeneration in the MPTP model of PD.",

    "abstract": "Many patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will develop cognitive impairment. Cross-sectional studies have shown that certain protein levels are altered in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PD patients with dementia and are thought to represent potential biomarkers of underlying pathogenesis. Recent studies suggest that CSF biomarker levels may be predictive of future risk of cognitive decline in non-demented PD patients. However, the strength of this evidence and difference between specific CSF biomarkers is not well delineated. We therefore performed a systematic review to assess if levels of specific CSF protein biomarkers are predictive of progression to cognitive impairment. Nine articles were identified that met inclusion criteria for the review. Findings from the review suggest a convergence of evidence that a low baseline A\u03b242 in the CSF of non-demented PD patients predicts development of cognitive impairment over time. Conversely, there is limited evidence that CSF levels of tau, either total tau or phosphorylated tau, is a useful predictive biomarker. There are mixed results for other CSF biomarkers such as \u03b1-synuclein, Neurofilament light chain, and Heart fatty acid-binding protein. Overall the results of this review show that certain CSF biomarkers have better predictive ability to identify PD patients who are at risk for developing cognitive impairment. Given the interest in developing disease-modifying therapies, identifying this group will be important for clinical trials as initiation of therapy prior to the onset of cognitive decline is likely to be more efficacious.",

    "abstract": "Pain is a troublesome nonmotor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). This double-blind exploratory pilot study (NCT01744496) was the first to specifically investigate the effect of a dopamine agonist on PD-associated pain as primary outcome. Patients with advanced PD (ie, receiving levodopa) and at least moderate PD-associated chronic pain (\u22653 months, \u22654 points on 11-point Likert pain scale) were randomized to rotigotine (optimal/maximum dose \u226416 mg/24h) or placebo and maintained for 12 weeks. Primary efficacy variable was change in pain severity (Likert pain scale) from baseline to end of maintenance. Secondary variables included percentage of responders (\u22652-point Likert pain scale reduction), King's PD Pain Scale (KPPS) domains, and PD Questionnaire (PDQ-8). Statistical analyses were exploratory. Of 68 randomized patients, 60 (rotigotine, 30; placebo, 30) were evaluable for efficacy. A numerical improvement in pain was observed in favor of rotigotine (Likert pain scale: least-squares mean [95%CI] treatment difference, -0.76 [-1.87 to 0.34]; P = .172), and proportion of responders was 18/30 (60%) rotigotine vs 14/30 (47%) placebo. An \u223c2-fold numerical improvement in KPPS domain \"fluctuation-related pain\" was observed with rotigotine vs placebo. Rotigotine improved PDQ-8 vs placebo (-8.01 [-15.56 to -0.46]; P = .038). These results suggest rotigotine may improve PD-associated pain; a large-scale confirmatory study is needed.",

The effects of intravenous administration of\u00a0the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist ZM24138 on pelvic nerve evoked field\u00a0potentials were examined. The effect of electrical stimulation of the anterior\u00a0cingulate cortex was also examined.\nRats with Parkinson's disease showed bladder overactivity as evidenced by a significant decrease in the intercontraction interval compared with sham operated rats. Intravenous administration of ZM24138 increased the intercontraction interval in both groups with the inhibitory effects greater in rats with Parkinson's disease. It dose dependently increased the amplitude of evoked potentials in the anterior cingulate cortex of rats with Parkinson's disease but not in sham operated rats. Intravenous administration of ZM24138 decreased evoked potential amplitude in the periaqueductal gray of both groups with the\u00a0inhibitory effects greater in Parkinson's disease vs sham operated rats. Electrical stimulation of the anterior cingulate cortex significantly increased the\u00a0intercontraction interval.\nThese results suggest that anterior cingulate cortex neurons have an inhibitory role in bladder control. Neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex was significantly increased along with suppression of bladder overactivity after ZM241385 administration in the Parkinson's disease model and the stimulation of the anterior cingulate cortex inhibited the micturition reflex. Understanding the roles of the anterior cingulate cortex in the modulation of micturition could provide further insights into the pathophysiology of overactive bladder.",

    "abstract": "Parkin related Parkinson's disease (PD) is differentiated from idiopathic PD by absent or sparse Lewy bodies, and preserved olfaction. The significance of single Parkin mutations in the pathogenesis of PD is debated.\nTo assess olfaction results according to Parkin mutation status. To compare the prevalence of Parkin single heterozygous mutations in patients diagnosed with PD to the rate in healthy controls in order to establish whether these single mutations could be a risk factor for developing PD.\nParkin gene mutation testing was performed in young onset PD (diagnosed <50 years old) to identify three groups: Parkin homozygous or compound heterozygote mutation carriers, Parkin single heterozygote mutation carriers, and non-carriers of Parkin mutations. Olfaction was tested using the 40-item British version of the University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT).\nOf 344 young onset PD cases tested, 8 (2.3%) were Parkin compound heterozygotes and 13 (3.8%) were Parkin single heterozygotes. Olfaction results were available in 282 cases (eight compound heterozygotes, nine single heterozygotes, and 265 non-carriers). In Parkin compound heterozygotes, the median UPSIT score was 33, interquartile range (IQR) 28.5-36.5, which was significantly better than in single Parkin heterozygotes (median 19, IQR 18-28) and non-carriers (median score 22, IQR 16-28) (ANOVA P < 0.001). These differences persisted after adjusting for age, disease duration, gender, and smoking (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in UPSIT scores between single heterozygotes and non-carriers (P = 0.90).\nPatients with Parkin compound heterozygous mutations have relatively preserved olfaction compared to Parkin single heterozygotes and non-carriers. The prevalence of Parkin single heterozygosity is similar to the 3.7% rate reported in healthy controls.",

    "abstract": "The most widely used method to assess motor functioning in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients is the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale-III (UPDRS-III). The UPDRS-III has limited ability to detect subtle changes in motor symptoms. Alternatively, graphical tasks can be used to provide objective measures of upper limb motor dysfunction. This study investigated the validity of such graphical tasks to assess upper limb function in PD patients and their ability to detect subtle changes in performance. Fourteen PD patients performed graphical tasks before and after taking dopaminergic medication. Graphical tasks included figure tracing, writing, and a modified Fitts' task. The Purdue pegboard test was performed to validate these graphical tasks. Movement time (MT), writing size, and the presence of tremor were assessed. MT on the graphical tasks correlated significantly with performance on the Purdue pegboard test (Spearman's \u03c1 > 0.65; p < 0.05). MT decreased significantly after the intake of dopaminergic medication. Tremor power decreased after taking dopaminergic medication in most PD patients who suffered from tremor. Writing size did not correlate with performance on the Purdue pegboard test, nor did it change after taking medication. Our set of graphical tasks is valid to assess upper limb function in PD patients. MT proved to be the most useful measure for this purpose. The response on dopaminergic medication was optimally reflected by an improved MT on the graphical tasks in combination with a decreased tremor power, whereas writing size did not respond to dopaminergic treatment.",

    "abstract": "To our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) developing upper cervical spine infections. Our objective is to present a case of upper cervical epidural abscess in a patient with PD and to review upper cervical spine infection. We present the patient's presentation, physical examination, imaging findings, and management as well a review of the literature. A 66-year-old male with PD presented to the emergency department (ED) following referral by a neurologist for a presumed C2 fracture. The preceding history was 1 week of severe neck pain requiring a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which was initially interpreted as a C2 fracture. On admission from the ED, further review of the MRI appeared to show anterior prevertebral abscess and an epidural abscess. The patient's neurological examination was at baseline. In the span of 2 days, the patient developed significant motor weakness. A repeat MRI demonstrated expansion of the epidural collection and spinal cord compression. Surgical management consisting of C1 and C2 laminectomy, irrigation, and debridement from anterior and posterior approaches was performed. Postoperatively, the patient did not recover any motor strength and elected to withdraw care and died. Spinal epidural abscess requires a high index of suspicion and needs prompt recognition to prevent neurological impairment. Upper cervical spine infections are rare but can lead to lethal consequences.",

    "abstract": "In recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), 11 risk loci were identified in patients with familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) in different populations. The LRRK2 gene was found to be a mutation hot spot in European and Asian populations. The aim of the present study was to investigate the incidence of G2019S and R1441C mutations in the LRRK2 gene in individuals from the Xinjiang region of China, and to explore the associations between LRRK2 gene single nucleotide mutations and susceptibility to PD in the Uyghur and Han populations of Xinjiang. A case-control study was conducted with a group of 312 patients with PD, including 130 Uyghur and 182 Han individuals. The control group comprised 359 subjects, including 179 Uyghur and 180 Han individuals. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing methods were used to detect the G2019S and R1441C mutations in the LRRK2 gene in the Uyghur and Han populations. No known mutations or new hybrids were found. Thus, there was no evidence that Uyghur and Han patients with PD possess the G2019S or R1441C mutations of the LRRK2 gene. This does not exclude the possibility of the presence other LRRK2 gene mutations that are associated with PD in the Uyghur and Han populations. In the future, the association of the LRRK2 gene with PD development in different regions and populations requires further study, in addition to the regulatory effects of the G2019S and R1441C mutations on gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Pilot study to evaluate computer-guided deep brain stimulation (DBS) programming designed to optimize stimulation settings using objective motion sensor-based motor assessments.\nSeven subjects (five males; 54-71 years) with Parkinson's disease (PD) and recently implanted DBS systems participated in this pilot study. Within two months of lead implantation, the subject returned to the clinic to undergo computer-guided programming and parameter selection. A motion sensor was placed on the index finger of the more affected hand. Software guided a monopolar survey during which monopolar stimulation on each contact was iteratively increased followed by an automated assessment of tremor and bradykinesia. After completing assessments at each setting, a software algorithm determined stimulation settings designed to minimize symptom severities, side effects, and battery usage.\nOptimal DBS settings were chosen based on average severity of motor symptoms measured by the motion sensor. Settings chosen by the software algorithm identified a therapeutic window and improved tremor and bradykinesia by an average of 35.7% compared with baseline in the \"off\" state (p < 0.01).\nMotion sensor-based computer-guided DBS programming identified stimulation parameters that significantly improved tremor and bradykinesia with minimal clinician involvement. Automated motion sensor-based mapping is worthy of further investigation and may one day serve to extend programming to populations without access to specialized DBS centers.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal \u03b1-synuclein in selected regions of the brain following a gradient of severity with disease progression. Whether this is accompanied by globally altered protein synthesis is poorly documented. The present study was carried out in PD stages 1-6 of Braak and middle-aged (MA) individuals without alterations in brain in the substantia nigra, frontal cortex area 8, angular gyrus, precuneus and putamen.\nReduced mRNA expression of nucleolar proteins nucleolin (NCL), nucleophosmin (NPM1), nucleoplasmin 3 (NPM3) and upstream binding transcription factor (UBF), decreased NPM1 but not NPM3 nucleolar protein immunostaining in remaining neurons; diminished 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA; reduced expression of several mRNAs encoding ribosomal protein (RP) subunits; and altered protein levels of initiation factor eIF3 and elongation factor eEF2 of protein synthesis was found in the substantia nigra in PD along with disease progression. Although many of these changes can be related to neuron loss in the substantia nigra, selective alteration of certain factors indicates variable degree of vulnerability of mRNAs, rRNAs and proteins in degenerating sustantia nigra. NPM1 mRNA and 18S rRNA was increased in the frontal cortex area 8 at stage 5-6; modifications were less marked and region-dependent in the angular gyrus and precuneus. Several RPs were abnormally regulated in the frontal cortex area 8 and precuneus, but only one RP in the angular gyrus, in PD. Altered levels of eIF3 and eIF1, and decrease eEF1A and eEF2 protein levels were observed in the frontal cortex in PD. No modifications were found in the putamen at any time of the study except transient modifications in 28S rRNA and only one RP mRNA at stages 5-6. These observations further indicate marked region-dependent and stage-dependent alterations in the cerebral cortex in PD. Altered solubility and \u03b1-synuclein oligomer formation, assessed in total homogenate fractions blotted with anti-\u03b1-synuclein oligomer-specific antibody, was demonstrated in the substantia nigra and frontal cortex, but not in the putamen, in PD. Dramatic increase in \u03b1-synuclein oligomers was also seen in fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS)-isolated nuclei in the frontal cortex in PD.\nAltered machinery of protein synthesis is altered in the substantia nigra and cerebral cortex in PD being the frontal cortex area 8 more affected than the angular gyrus and precuneus; in contrast, pathways of protein synthesis are apparently preserved in the putamen. This is associated with the presence of \u03b1-synuclein oligomeric species in total homogenates; substantia nigra and frontal cortex are enriched, albeit with different band patterns, in \u03b1-synuclein oligomeric species, whereas \u03b1-synuclein oligomers are not detected in the putamen.",

    "results": "Reduced mRNA expression of nucleolar proteins nucleolin (NCL), nucleophosmin (NPM1), nucleoplasmin 3 (NPM3) and upstream binding transcription factor (UBF), decreased NPM1 but not NPM3 nucleolar protein immunostaining in remaining neurons; diminished 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA; reduced expression of several mRNAs encoding ribosomal protein (RP) subunits; and altered protein levels of initiation factor eIF3 and elongation factor eEF2 of protein synthesis was found in the substantia nigra in PD along with disease progression. Although many of these changes can be related to neuron loss in the substantia nigra, selective alteration of certain factors indicates variable degree of vulnerability of mRNAs, rRNAs and proteins in degenerating sustantia nigra. NPM1 mRNA and 18S rRNA was increased in the frontal cortex area 8 at stage 5-6; modifications were less marked and region-dependent in the angular gyrus and precuneus. Several RPs were abnormally regulated in the frontal cortex area 8 and precuneus, but only one RP in the angular gyrus, in PD. Altered levels of eIF3 and eIF1, and decrease eEF1A and eEF2 protein levels were observed in the frontal cortex in PD. No modifications were found in the putamen at any time of the study except transient modifications in 28S rRNA and only one RP mRNA at stages 5-6. These observations further indicate marked region-dependent and stage-dependent alterations in the cerebral cortex in PD. Altered solubility and \u03b1-synuclein oligomer formation, assessed in total homogenate fractions blotted with anti-\u03b1-synuclein oligomer-specific antibody, was demonstrated in the substantia nigra and frontal cortex, but not in the putamen, in PD. Dramatic increase in \u03b1-synuclein oligomers was also seen in fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS)-isolated nuclei in the frontal cortex in PD.",

    "abstract": "Lewy bodies (LBs), which mainly consist of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), are neuropathological hallmarks of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The fine structure of LBs is unknown, and LBs cannot be made artificially. Nevertheless, many studies have described fibrillisation using recombinant \u03b1-syn purified from E. coli. An extremely fundamental problem is whether the structure of LBs is the same as that of recombinant amyloid fibrils. Thus, we used synchrotron Fourier transform infrared micro-spectroscopy (FTIRM) to analyse the fine structure of LBs in the brain of PD patients. Our results showed a shift in the infrared spectrum that indicates abundance of a \u03b2-sheet-rich structure in LBs. Also, 2D infrared mapping of LBs revealed that the content of the \u03b2-sheet structure is higher in the halo than in the core, and the core contains a large amount of proteins and lipids.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and their caregivers are at risk for emotional distress and hypercortisolism. Expressive writing is an effective complementary intervention to ameliorate the psychological and physiological effects of chronic illness. This pilot study aimed to evaluate feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an expressive writing intervention for individuals with PD and their caregivers.\nIndividuals with PD (N\u2009=\u200927) and their caregivers (N\u2009=\u200914) were randomly assigned to expressive (N\u2009=\u200915 patients, eight caregivers) or neutral (N\u2009=\u200912 patients, six caregivers) writing conditions. Cortisol awakening response (CAR), non-motor functioning, quality of life, and performance on tests of cognitive functioning were assessed at baseline, immediate post, 4-month, and 10-month post intervention.\nAttrition was a challenge as eight patients (29.62 %) and four caregivers (28.57 %) chose to discontinue before beginning the intervention or were lost to follow up prior to completing the intervention or the first follow up visit. Significant reduction in anxiety, marginally significant improvement in depression and caregiver burden, and significant improvements in performance on tests of learning and memory were observed, but these changes did not differ by writing condition. CAR significantly differed over time between patients and caregivers and writing conditions.\nSome evidence for the feasibility and effectiveness of writing to alleviate hypercortisolism was demonstrated in a small sample of PD patients; however, relatively high attrition rates and the lack of difference between expressive and neutral writing conditions on emotional and neurocognitive outcomes suggests expressive writing procedure modifications may be needed to obtain optimal results for this population.\nClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02217735 , Study Start Date: August 30, 2011.",

    "abstract": "Examine outcomes for the National Parkinson Foundation (NPF) Allied Team Training for Parkinson (ATTP), an interprofessional education (IPE) program in Parkinson's disease (PD) and team-based care for medicine, nursing, occupational, physical and music therapies, physician assistant, social work and speech-language pathology disciplines.\nHealthcare professionals need education in evidence-based PD practices and working effectively in teams. Few evidence-based models of IPE in PD exist.\nKnowledge about PD, team-based care, the role of other disciplines and attitudes towards healthcare teams were measured before and after a protocol-driven training program. Knowledge, attitudes and practice changes were again measured at 6-month post-training. Trainee results were compared to results of controls.\nTwenty-six NPF-ATTP trainings were held across the U.S. (2003-2013). Compared to control participants (n = 100), trainees (n = 1468) showed statistically significant posttest improvement in all major outcomes, including self-perceived (p < 0.001) and objective knowledge (p < 0.001), Understanding Role of Other Disciplines (p < 0.001), Attitudes Toward Health Care Teams Scale (p < 0.001), and the Attitudes Toward Value of Teams (p < 0.001) subscale. Despite some decline, significant improvements were largely sustained at six-month post-training. Qualitative analyses confirmed post-training practice changes.\nThe NPF-ATTP model IPE program showed sustained positive gains in knowledge of PD, team strategies and role of other disciplines, team attitudes, and important practice improvements. Further research should examine longer-term outcomes, objectively measure practice changes and mediators, and determine impact on patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "A large percentage of patients with Parkinson's disease have hypokinetic dysarthria, exhibiting reduced peak velocities of jaw and lips during speech. This limitation implies a reduction of speech intelligibility for such patients. This work aims at testing a cost-effective markerless approach for assessing kinematic parameters of hypokinetic dysarthria.\nKinematic parameters of the lips are calculated during a syllable repetition task from 14 Parkinsonian patients and 14 age-matched control subjects.\nCombining color and depth frames provided by a depth sensor (Microsoft Kinect), we computed the three-dimensional coordinates of main facial points. The peak velocities and accelerations of the lower lip during a syllable repetition task are considered to compare the two groups.\nResults show that Parkinsonian patients exhibit reduced peak velocities of the lower lip, both during the opening and the closing phase of the mouth. In addition, peak values of acceleration are reduced in Parkinsonian patients, although with significant differences only in the opening phase with respect to healthy control subjects.\nThe novel contribution of this work is the implementation of an entirely markerless technique capable to detect signs of hypokinetic dysarthria for the analysis of articulatory movements during speech. Although a large number of Parkinsonian patients have hypokinetic dysarthria, only a small percentage of them undergoes speech therapy to increase their articulatory movements. The system proposed here could be easily implemented in a home environment, thus, increasing the percentage of patients who can perform speech rehabilitation at home.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-SYN) aggregates represent a key feature of Parkinson's disease, but the exact relationship between \u03b1-SYN aggregation and neurodegeneration remains incompletely understood. Therefore, the availability of a cellular assay that allows medium-throughput analysis of \u03b1-SYN-linked pathology will be of great value for studying the aggregation process and for advancing \u03b1-SYN-based therapies.\nHere we describe a high-content neuronal cell assay that simultaneously measures oxidative stress-induced \u03b1-SYN aggregation and apoptosis.\nWe optimized an automated and reproducible assay to quantify both \u03b1-SYN aggregation and cell death in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.\nQuantification of \u03b1-SYN aggregates in cells has typically relied on manual imaging and counting or cell-free assays, which are time consuming and do not allow a concurrent analysis of cell viability. Our high-content analysis method for quantification of \u03b1-SYN aggregation allows simultaneous measurements of multiple cell parameters at a single-cell level in a fast, objective and automated manner.\nThe presented analysis approach offers a rapid, objective and multiparametric approach for the screening of compounds and genes that might alter \u03b1-SYN aggregation and/or toxicity.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesized that deterministic tractography is practical and sensitive to changes in the complex nigrostriatal and nigropallidal pathway (NSP) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography, we investigated the NSP to evaluate differences between PD patients and controls, and examined their clinico-radiologic correlation. Structural and DTI brain scans were obtained in 40 subjects (21 PD patients and 19 healthy controls). We isolated the NSP using a user-friendly DTI toolkit based on deterministic brute-force tractography. DTI parameters of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean, axial, and radial diffusivity, and streamline count of the NSP were measured. Average FA (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and streamline count (p\u2009<\u20090.001) were significantly lower in the PD compared to control group. Mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity were significantly higher in the PD group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Average streamline count correlated with the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Point-to-point FA profiles of the tract demonstrated peak divergence between PD and control towards the tract midpoint rather than the distal grey matter. Our findings demonstrated a clinically and radiologically practical application of DTI tractography to the NSP in PD, without requiring complex imaging sequences for anatomical localization or segmentation software.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to estimate, at a tertiary referral center, the proportion of essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who underwent DBS surgery.\nDBS surgery is an important treatment for ET and PD. Surprisingly, there are no published data on the precise proportion of such patients who are referred for this procedure.\nUsing the computerized billing database at the Center for Parkinson's Disease and Other Movement Disorders, Columbia University Medical Center, we searched for patients who received the diagnostic codes 333.1 (tremor) and 332.0 (PD) and who were followed by a doctor at the center during the 5-year period from 2009 to 2014. The number of patients who underwent DBS surgery for these diagnoses during this time period was also determined.\nSeventy-seven patients with these diagnoses (52 PD, 14 ET, and 11 ET + PD) who were followed at the center underwent DBS surgery during this time period. The proportion of ET patients who underwent DBS surgery was 2.90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.78-4.02), and for PD this was 1.38% (95% CI: 1.04-1.72). The difference was significant (\nAt a tertiary-referral center, 1 in 34 ET patients and 1 in 72 PD patients underwent DBS surgery. Similar studies from other major centers would be of additional value. These data are likely to have utility when planning health care services for patients with these diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction represents a critical step during the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), and increasing evidence suggests abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and quality control as important underlying mechanisms. The VPS35 gene, which encodes a key component of the membrane protein-recycling retromer complex, is the third autosomal-dominant gene associated with PD. However, how VPS35 mutations lead to neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that PD-associated VPS35 mutations caused mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death in cultured neurons in vitro, in mouse substantia nigra neurons in vivo and in human fibroblasts from an individual with PD who has the VPS35(D620N) mutation. VPS35-induced mitochondrial deficits and neuronal dysfunction could be prevented by inhibition of mitochondrial fission. VPS35 mutants showed increased interaction with dynamin-like protein (DLP) 1, which enhanced turnover of the mitochondrial DLP1 complexes via the mitochondria-derived vesicle-dependent trafficking of the complexes to lysosomes for degradation. Notably, oxidative stress increased the VPS35-DLP1 interaction, which we also found to be increased in the brains of sporadic PD cases. These results revealed a novel cellular mechanism for the involvement of VPS35 in mitochondrial fission, dysregulation of which is probably involved in the pathogenesis of familial, and possibly sporadic, PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with the major pathology being the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) midbrain neurons in the substantia nigra. As early as in the 1980s, open-label clinical trials employing fetal ventral mesencephalon (fVM) tissues have demonstrated significant efficacy for PD treatment, which led to two NIH-sponsored double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials. However, both trials showed only mild outcome. Retrospective analysis revealed several possible reasons that include patient selection, heterogeneity of grafts, immune recognition of grafts, lack of standardization of transplantation procedure and uneven distribution of grafts. Recent years have seen advances in reprogramming technologies which may provide solutions to the problems associated with fVM tissues. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) hold promise for generating clinical grade DA neural cells that are safe, homogeneous, scalable and standardizable. These new technologies may bring back clinical trials using cell therapy for PD treatment in the future.",

    "abstract": "This study explored the association between cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (CMRGlc) and the severity of Vascular Parkinsonism (VP) and Parkinson's disease (PD). A cross-sectional study was performed to compare CMRGlc in normal subjects vs. VP and PD patients. Twelve normal subjects, 22 VP, and 11 PD patients were evaluated with the H&Y and MMSE, and underwent 18F-FDG measurements. Pearson's correlations were used to identify potential associations between the severity of VP/PD and CMRGlc. A pronounced reduction of CMRGlc in the frontal lobe and caudate putamen was detected in patients with VP and PD when compared with normal subjects. The VP patients displayed a slight CMRGlc decrease in the caudate putamen and frontal lobe in comparison with PD patients. These decreases in CMRGlc in the frontal lobe and caudate putamen were significantly correlated with the VP patients' H&Y, UPDRS II, UPDRS III, MMSE, cardiovascular, and attention/memory scores. Similarly, significant correlations were observed in patients with PD. This is the first clinical study finding strong evidence for an association between low cerebral glucose metabolism and the severity of VP and PD. Our findings suggest that these changes in glucose metabolism in the frontal lobe and caudate putamen may underlie the pathophysiological mechanisms of VP and PD. As the scramble to find imaging biomarkers or predictors of the disease intensifies, a better understanding of the roles of cerebral glucose metabolism may give us insight into the pathogenesis of VP and PD.",

    "abstract": "Gait abnormalities, such as shuffling steps, start hesitation, and freezing, are common and often incapacitating symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other parkinsonian disorders. Pharmacological and surgical approaches have only limited efficacy in treating these gait disorders. Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS), such as playing marching music and dance therapy, has been shown to be a safe, inexpensive, and an effective method in improving gait in PD patients. However, RAS that adapts to patients' movements may be more effective than rigid, fixed-tempo RAS used in most studies. In addition to auditory cueing, immersive virtual reality technologies that utilize interactive computer-generated systems through wearable devices are increasingly used for improving brain-body interaction and sensory-motor integration. Using multisensory cues, these therapies may be particularly suitable for the treatment of parkinsonian freezing and other gait disorders. In this review, we examine the affected neurological circuits underlying gait and temporal processing in PD patients and summarize the current studies demonstrating the effects of RAS on improving these gait deficits.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by the degeneration and death of midbrain dopamine and non-dopamine neurons in the brain leading to motor dysfunctions and other symptoms, which seriously influence the quality of life of PD patients. The drug L-dopa can alleviate the motor symptoms in PD, but so far there are no rational therapies targeting the underlying neurodegenerative processes. Despite intensive research, the molecular mechanisms causing neuronal loss are not fully understood which has hampered the development of new drugs and disease-modifying therapies. Neurotrophic factors are by virtue of their survival promoting activities attract candidates to counteract and possibly halt cell degeneration in PD. In particular, studies employing glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its family member neurturin (NRTN), as well as the recently described cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) and the mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) have shown positive results in protecting and repairing dopaminergic neurons in various models of PD. Other substances with trophic actions in dopaminergic neurons include neuropeptides and small compounds that target different pathways impaired in PD, such as increased cell stress, protein handling defects, dysfunctional mitochondria and neuroinflammation. In this review, we will highlight the recent developments in this field with a focus on trophic factors and substances having the potential to beneficially influence the viability and functions of dopaminergic neurons as shown in preclinical or in animal models of PD.",

    "abstract": "Changes in voice and speech are thought to involve 75-90% of people with PD, but the impact of PD progression on voice/speech parameters is not well defined. In this study, we assessed voice/speech symptoms in 48 parkinsonian patients staging <3 on the modified Hoehn and Yahr scale and 37 healthy subjects using the Robertson dysarthria profile (a clinical-perceptual method exploring all components potentially involved in speech difficulties), the Voice handicap index (a validated measure of the impact of voice symptoms on quality of life) and the speech evaluation parameter contained in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III). Accuracy and metric properties of the Robertson dysarthria profile were also measured. On Robertson dysarthria profile, all parkinsonian patients yielded lower scores than healthy control subjects. Differently, the Voice Handicap Index and the speech evaluation parameter contained in the UPDRS-III could detect speech/voice disturbances in 10 and 75% of PD patients, respectively. Validation procedure in Parkinson's disease patients showed that the Robertson dysarthria profile has acceptable reliability, satisfactory internal consistency and scaling assumptions, lack of floor and ceiling effects, and partial correlations with UPDRS-III and Voice Handicap Index. We concluded that speech/voice disturbances are widely identified by the Robertson dysarthria profile in early parkinsonian patients, even when the disturbances do not carry a significant level of disability. Robertson dysarthria profile may be a valuable tool to detect speech/voice disturbances in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The objective of our study was to investigate the association of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with genetic risk of dementia. In 212 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), we investigated two polymorphisms within the G-protein coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) gene (rs2420616, rs4752293) to determine a possible risk factor for dementia. We identified two alleles most significantly present in PD patients with dementia: G and T alleles. We also identified risk haplotypes: GC, and AT. We demonstrated that the SNPs and the related haplotypes could play a central role in predisposing PD patients to cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Supine hypertension is frequently associated with autonomic failure. However, its clinical characteristics in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) remain unclear. The present study aimed to clarify the characteristics of supine hypertension in patients with de novo PD.\nThe subjects were 72 patients with de novo PD. We studied blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine levels after the patients rested for 20 min in the supine position. Changes in blood pressure were also examined on head-up tilt-table testing.\nThe disease duration was 1.7 \u00b1 1.6 years (average \u00b1 SD). Thirty-three (45.8 %) patients had supine hypertension (defined as a blood pressure of \u2265140/90 mmHg). Supine blood pressure positively correlated with the degree of orthostatic hypotension. Age and the proportion of patients with akinetic-rigid motor subtype or preexisting hypertension were higher among patients with supine hypertension than among those without supine hypertension. The Mini-Mental State Examination score was lower in patients with supine hypertension than in those without supine hypertension. Sex, disease duration, disease severity, and peripheral sympathetic nervous activity as evaluated by the cardiac uptake of (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine and the plasma norepinephrine level did not differ between patients with and those without supine hypertension.\nOlder age, akinetic-rigid motor subtype, and preexisting hypertension are independent risk factors for supine hypertension. Supine hypertension alone may be associated with milder peripheral sympathetic nervous denervation than orthostatic hypotension alone. As for global cognitive decline, supine hypertension is a far riskier comorbidity of early-stage PD than is orthostatic hypotension.",

A total of 50 consecutive Parkinson's disease participants and 50 healthy volunteers (control group) were enrolled. External locus of control was significantly higher in Parkinson's disease participants, whereas internal locus of control had no significant differences. External locus of control and internal locus of control were correlated in control group, but not in Parkinson's disease. In Parkinson's disease participants, external locus of control was negatively associated with health-related quality of life as well as positively associated with emotional distress and disease severity (but not with disability). After adjusting to confound variables, the associations remained. On the other hand, internal locus of control was negatively associated with depression.",

    "abstract": "The Arabian Gulf region is a rapidly developing part of the world. With the increase in average life-expectancy, idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), is also expected to increase in prevalence. Furthermore, the high rate of consanguinity among Arabs probably makes familial cases of PD more likely to be encountered than other areas in the world. This review provides an update on the published literature on sporadic and familial PD in Gulf Arabs.\nAlthough the Arab population of this region shares religious beliefs and demographic characteristics with other Arabs, their environmental exposures and genetic makeup may be different. This could account for the relatively low prevalence of PD reported in the Al-Thugba study (27 per 100,000) compared with prevalence rates by most other studies on Arab (mainly North African) populations (31.4-557.4 per 100,000).\nGulf countries are considered rich countries, which makes conducting nation-wide or even international studies logistically easier than it is in many other countries. Such multinational research can be organized by the existing Gulf Cooperation Council, or through a collaboration of the Ministries of Health. This would, hopefully, culminate in the introduction of more research centers, as well as the implementation of better health care policies and practices for the ageing community.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD), parkinsonian syndromes (PS) and essential tremor (ET) are different types of movement disorders which share some symptoms resulting in a difficulty of certain diagnosis. This study was conducted to determine the value of (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 scan to differentiate PD from ET and other PS cases.\nTotally, 75 patients were studied including 29 PD, 6 possible PD, 22 ET and 18 PS cases. A dual-head SPECT-CT was used to perform basal ganglia (BG) imaging following administration of (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1. The BG uptake values were normalized to whole brain and occipital activity. All patients were followed for 2-22 months to reach a certain diagnosis.\nPatients with ET and drug-induced parkinsonism show significantly higher normalized BG uptake as compared to the other subgroups; however, no significant difference was noted between PD and PS patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the findings for the differentiation between patients with the disease associated versus not associated with BG dysfunction were 80 and 83.3%, respectively. A predictive positive value of 82.6% was obtained using an additive scaling index defined as asymmetry and unevenness of uptake in putamen and/or caudate contralateral to the dominant side of current symptoms.\n(99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 scan is an appropriate method to differentiate PD or PS versus ET. A combination of scan pattern including asymmetry of BG uptake and unevenness of activity in caudate and putamen along with the side of dominant symptoms may be valuable for the differentiation of Parkinson's disease from the other parkinsonian syndromes.",

The relationship between supine sleep and sleep-disordered breathing has never been explored in people with Parkinson's disease.\nFifteen consecutive people with PD with severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) were compared to: (1) 15 age-matched, gender-matched, body mass index-matched and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III score-matched people with PD without sleep-disordered breathing; (2) 11 age-matched and gender-matched people with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) alone; and (3) 11 age-matched and gender-matched healthy controls. Outcomes were: number of position changes during the night and per hour of sleep, and the percentage of sleep time spent in supine.\nPeople with PD and severe OSAS spent most of their sleep time in the supine position (93\u2009\u00b1\u200911%); while people with PD without OSAS (61\u2009\u00b1\u200924%, p\u2009<0.001), people with isolated, severe OSAS (50\u2009\u00b1\u200928%, p\u2009<0.001), and the controls (40\u2009\u00b1\u200921, p\u2009<0.001) spent significantly less time on their back.

    "abstract": "Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is rare cause of intestinal obstruction. We report an unusual case of a patient with Parkinson's disease who developed superior mesenteric artery syndrome and discuss her management including laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy and Roux-en-Y anastomosis.\nA 78-year-old patient with advanced Parkinson's disease presented with significant malnutrition, vomiting and post-prandial abdominal pain. Computed tomography confirmed duodenal compression by the superior mesenteric artery. We hypothesised this was likely triggered by extreme weight loss associated with advanced Parkinson's disease. As the patient failed to improve with conservative measures, laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy and Roux-en-Y anastomosis was successfully performed without complications and the patient discharged on day 7.\nSuccessful treatment was achieved due to early recognition of the consequences of chronic illness and addressing malnutrition. From this experience, we propose that laparoscopic gastric bypass is a safe and minimally invasive effective treatment option for superior mesenteric artery syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Postural instability (PI) and falls, major causes of morbidity in patients with PD, are often overlooked. DBS is a mainstay therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) and has been purported to both worsen and improve PI. An effective PI evaluation that can predict fall risk in patients with PD presenting for DBS is needed.\nForty-nine consecutive patients with PD were enrolled. Self-reported falls were the gold standard. Tests evaluated were the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG), Pull Test, and Biodex Balance System Sway Index on firm (SI-FIRM) and soft (SI-SOFT) surfaces.\nThe best single tests for fall risk were the BBS and SI-FIRM, each with sensitivities of 79% and specificities of 60% and 65%, respectively. When the evaluation was combined into a composite measure requiring four positive tests out of five, the sensitivity was 72% and specificity was 80%.\nA simple, efficient outpatient physical therapy assessment is effective in diagnosing fall risk in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Pathologically, Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by nigral cell loss and Lewy pathology in the remaining neurons. Whereas the motor symptoms of PD show a marked response to dopamine replacement therapy, many of the non-motor symptoms are resistant to treatment. This suggests that in addition to nigral cell loss, widespread Lewy pathology in the nervous system is associated with the manifestations of PD. Areas covered: Although the mechanism of Lewy body formation remains largely unknown, it is becoming clear that changes in the behavior of \u03b1-synuclein are critical in this process. \u03b1-Synuclein behaves differently depending on the lipid composition of membranes with which it interacts; therefore, one can postulate that the altered lipid composition of neuronal membranes may lead to Lewy pathology. The lipid composition of cellular membranes is consistently altered in the brains of patients with PD, and Lewy pathology is a common feature of several human lipidoses with mutations in enzymes that affect membrane lipids. This further supports the concept that alterations in the membrane lipids of neurons are central to Lewy pathology. Expert opinion: This concept provides a new platform to establish models for the development of novel treatments for PD.",

    "abstract": "We have assessed the impact of \u03b1-synuclein overexpression on the differentiation potential and phenotypic signatures of two neural-committed induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from a Parkinson's disease patient with a triplication of the human SNCA genomic locus. In parallel, comparative studies were performed on two control lines derived from healthy individuals and lines generated from the patient iPS-derived neuroprogenitor lines infected with a lentivirus incorporating a small hairpin RNA to knock down the SNCA mRNA. The SNCA triplication lines exhibited a reduced capacity to differentiate into dopaminergic or GABAergic neurons and decreased neurite outgrowth and lower neuronal activity compared with control cultures. This delayed maturation phenotype was confirmed by gene expression profiling, which revealed a significant reduction in mRNA for genes implicated in neuronal differentiation such as delta-like homolog 1 (DLK1), gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 2 (GABABR2), nuclear receptor related 1 protein (NURR1), G-protein-regulated inward-rectifier potassium channel 2 (GIRK-2) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The differentiated patient cells also demonstrated increased autophagic flux when stressed with chloroquine. We conclude that a two-fold overexpression of \u03b1-synuclein caused by a triplication of the SNCA gene is sufficient to impair the differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells, a finding with implications for adult neurogenesis and Parkinson's disease progression, particularly in the context of bioenergetic dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) involves motor symptoms reflecting the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. However, diagnosis is only enabled late in the disease, limiting treatment to palliative assistance. Here, we review recently generated transcriptional profiling datasets from blood and brain RNA of human PD cohorts and animal models that may offer unprecedented progress in PD research. Specifically, advanced analysis techniques demonstrated functionally inter-related underlying impairments of RNA metabolism and neuroimmune signalling processes. Identifying novel biomarkers in serum and nucleated blood cells, including protein networks and non-coding RNAs can drive discovery of the molecular mechanisms involved and reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention, posing a dual diagnosis/treatment opportunity for limiting the exacerbation of neuroinflammatory events in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder. There is significantly elevated risk of cognitive decline and associated neuropsychiatric symptoms. Dementia may develop insidiously several years after manifestation of Parkinson motor symptoms (dementia associated with Parkinson's disease; Parkinson's disease dementia) or in close temporal relationship (within one year) after onset of motor symptoms (Dementia with Lewy bodies). There are clinical, pathophysiological and therapeutic similarities between these two conditions. Men are more frequently affected than women. Risk factor or indicators are advanced age at disease onset, disease duration, rigidity, akinesia and posture and gait impairment and falls as opposed to tremor dominance, and associated neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, apathy, hallucinosis, delirium). Dementia is treatable with cholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, donepezil), memantine, and adjustment of the pharmacological regimen of parkinsonian motor symptoms. Concomitant autonomic nervous system symptoms and neuropsychiatric complications warrant early clinical awareness and are accessible to pharmacological therapy.",

    "abstract": "High frequency (HF) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). It effectively treats the cardinal motor signs of PD, including tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. The most common neural target is the subthalamic nucleus, located within the basal ganglia, the region most acutely affected by PD pathology. Using chronically-implanted DBS electrodes, researchers have been able to record underlying neural rhythms from several nodes in the PD network as well as perturb it using DBS to measure the ensuing neural and behavioral effects, both acutely and over time. In this review, we provide an overview of the PD neural network, focusing on the pathophysiological signals that have been recorded from PD patients as well as the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic benefits of HF DBS. We then discuss evidence for the relationship between specific neural oscillations and symptoms of PD, including the aberrant relationships potentially underlying functional connectivity in PD as well as the use of different frequencies of stimulation to more specifically target certain symptoms. Finally, we briefly describe several current areas of investigation and how the ability to record neural data in ecologically-valid settings may allow researchers to explore the relationship between brain and behavior in an unprecedented manner, culminating in the future automation of neurostimulation therapy for the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are complex multifactorial disorders characterised by the interplay of many dysregulated physiological processes. As an exemplar, Parkinson's disease (PD) involves multiple perturbed cellular functions, including mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagic dysregulation in preferentially-sensitive dopamine neurons, a selective pathophysiology recapitulated in vitro using the neurotoxin MPP(+). Here we explore a network science approach for the selection of therapeutic protein targets in the cellular MPP(+) model. We hypothesised that analysis of protein-protein interaction networks modelling MPP(+) toxicity could identify proteins critical for mediating MPP(+) toxicity. Analysis of protein-protein interaction networks constructed to model the interplay of mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagic dysregulation (key aspects of MPP(+) toxicity) enabled us to identify four proteins predicted to be key for MPP(+) toxicity (P62, GABARAP, GBRL1 and GBRL2). Combined, but not individual, knockdown of these proteins increased cellular susceptibility to MPP(+) toxicity. Conversely, combined, but not individual, over-expression of the network targets provided rescue of MPP(+) toxicity associated with the formation of autophagosome-like structures. We also found that modulation of two distinct proteins in the protein-protein interaction network was necessary and sufficient to mitigate neurotoxicity. Together, these findings validate our network science approach to multi-target identification in complex neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting humans. It is characterized by dopaminergic neurodegeneration, mitochondrial impairment, and oxidative stress, enhanced lipid peroxidation, and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of glycyrrhizic acid (GA), an active component of licorice, against rotenone-induced-oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in a PD rat model. Since PD is progressive and chronic, we investigated the effect of chronic administration of GA for 4 weeks (50 mg/kg/day), 30 min prior to rotenone administration. Rotenone administration significantly reduced the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase, and caused the depletion of reduced glutathione. A concomitant increase in the levels of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde was observed. It also significantly enhanced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the midbrain and elevated the levels of inflammatory mediators such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significant increments in ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1) levels, and in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels, and loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta upon rotenone challenge. GA treatment significantly attenuated the dopamine neuron loss and decreased the Iba-1 and GFAP activation induced by the rotenone insult. GA also improved antioxidant enzyme activity, prevented glutathione depletion, inhibited lipid peroxidation, and attenuated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Subsequently, GA attenuated the increased levels of the inflammatory mediators COX-2 and iNOS. In conclusion, GA protects against rotenone-induced-PD. The neuroprotective effects of GA are attributed to its potent antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties.",

    "abstract": "To examine fall risk trajectories occurring naturally in a sample of individuals with early to middle stage Parkinson disease (PD).\nLatent class analysis, specifically growth mixture modeling (GMM), of longitudinal fall risk trajectories.\nAssessments were conducted at 1 of 4 universities.\nCommunity-dwelling participants with PD of a longitudinal cohort study who attended at least 2 of 5 assessments over a 2-year follow-up period (N=230).\nNot applicable.\nFall risk trajectory (low, medium, or high risk) and stability of fall risk trajectory (stable or fluctuating). Fall risk was determined at 6 monthly intervals using a simple clinical tool based on fall history, freezing of gait, and gait speed.\nThe GMM optimally grouped participants into 3 fall risk trajectories that closely mirrored baseline fall risk status (P=.001). The high fall risk trajectory was most common (42.6%) and included participants with longer and more severe disease and with higher postural instability and gait disability (PIGD) scores than the low and medium fall risk trajectories (P<.001). Fluctuating fall risk (posterior probability <0.8 of belonging to any trajectory) was found in only 22.6% of the sample, most commonly among individuals who were transitioning to PIGD predominance.\nRegardless of their baseline characteristics, most participants had clear and stable fall risk trajectories over 2 years. Further investigation is required to determine whether interventions to improve gait and balance may improve fall risk trajectories in people with PD.",

    "abstract": "To characterize the expression in skin nerves of native (n-syn) and misfolded phosphorylated (p-syn) \u03b1-synucleins in pure autonomic failure (PAF) and idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD). The specific aims were to (1) define the importance of n-syn and p-syn as disease biomarkers and (2) ascertain differences in abnormal synuclein skin nerve deposits.\nWe studied 30 patients, including 16 well-characterized IPD patients and 14 patients fulfilling PAF diagnostic criteria, and 15 age-matched controls. Subjects underwent skin biopsy from proximal (ie, cervical) and distal (ie, thigh and leg) sites to study small nerve fiber and intraneural n-syn and p-syn.\nPAF and IPD showed length-dependent somatic and autonomic small fiber loss, more severely expressed in patients with higher p-syn load. n-syn was similarly expressed in both groups of patients and controls. By contrast, p-syn was not evident in any skin sample of controls but was found in all PAF and IPD patients, although with different skin innervation. In addition, abnormal \u03b1-synuclein deposits were found in all analyzed skin samples in PAF but in only 49% of samples with a higher positivity rate at the proximal site in IPD.\n(1) Intraneural p-syn was a reliable in vivo marker of PAF and IPD; (2) neuritic p-syn inclusions differed in PAF and IPD, suggesting a different underlying pathogenesis; (3) when searching for abnormal p-syn deposits in skin nerves, the site of analysis is irrelevant in PAF but it is critical in IPD.",

    "abstract": "Background. Cognitive function is generally evaluated based on testing in the clinic, but this may not always reflect real-life function. We tested whether parameters derived from long-term, continuous monitoring of gait are associated with cognitive function in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods. 107 patients with PD (age: 64.9 \u00b1 9.3\u2009yrs; UPDRS motor sum \"off\": 40.4 \u00b1 13.2; 25.23% women) wore a 3D accelerometer on their lower back for 3 days. Computerized measures of global cognitive function, executive function, attention, and nonverbal memory were assessed. Three-day acceleration derived measures included cadence, variability, bilateral coordination, and dynamic postural control. Associations between the acceleration derived measures and cognitive function were determined. Results. Linear regression showed associations between vertical gait variability and cadence and between global cognitive score, attention, and executive function (p \u2264 0.048). Dynamic postural control was associated with global cognitive score and attention (p \u2264 0.027). Nonverbal memory was not associated with the acceleration-derived measures. Conclusions. These findings suggest that metrics derived from a 3-day worn body-fixed sensor reflect cognitive function, further supporting the idea that the gait pattern may be altered as cognition declines and that gait provides a window into cognitive function in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays a very critical role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), which is the second most common neurodegenerative disease among elderly people worldwide. Increasing evidence has suggested that phytobioactive compounds show enhanced benefits in cell and animal models of PD. Curcumin, resveratrol, ginsenosides, quercetin, and catechin are phyto-derived bioactive compounds with important roles in the prevention and treatment of PD. However, in vivo studies suggest that their concentrations are very low to cross blood-brain barrier thereby it limits bioavailability, stability, and dissolution at target sites in the brain. To overcome these problems, nanophytomedicine with the controlled size of 1-100 nm is used to maximize efficiency in the treatment of PD. Nanosizing of phytobioactive compounds enhances the permeability into the brain with maximized efficiency and stability. Several nanodelivery techniques, including solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, nanoliposomes, and nanoniosomes can be used for controlled delivery of nanobioactive compounds to brain. Nanocompounds, such as ginsenosides (19.9 nm) synthesized using a nanoemulsion technique, showed enhanced bioavailability in the rat brain. Here, we discuss the most recent trends and applications in PD, including 1) the role of phytobioactive compounds in reducing oxidative stress and their bioavailability; 2) the role of nanotechnology in reducing oxidative stress during PD; 3) nanodelivery systems; and 4) various nanophytobioactive compounds and their role in PD.",

    "abstract": "Pathologies of neurological diseases are increasingly recognized to have common structural and molecular events that can fit, sometimes loosely, into a central pathological theme. A better understanding of the genetic, proteomic and metabolic similarities between three common neurodegenerative diseases - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) - and how these similarities relate to their unique pathological features may shed more light on the underlying pathology of each. These are complex multigenic neuroinflammatory diseases caused by a combined action by multiple genetic mutations, lifestyle factors and environmental elements including a proposed contribution by transition metals. This comprehensive dynamic makes disease decoding and treatment difficult. One case of ALS, for example, can manifest from a very different pool of genetic mutations than another. In the case of ALS multiple genes in addition to SOD1 are implicated in the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial variants of the disease. These genes play different roles in the processing and trafficking of signalling, metabolic and structural proteins. However, many of these genetic mutations or the cellular machinery they regulate can play a role in one form or another in PD and AD as well. In addition, the more recent understanding of how TREM-2 mutations factor into inflammatory response has shed new light on how chronic inflammatory activity can escalate to uncontrolled systemic levels in a variety of inflammatory diseases from neurodegenerative, auto-inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. TREM-2 mutations represent yet another complicating element in these multigenic disease pathologies. This review takes us one step back to discuss basic pathological features of these neurodegenerative diseases known to us for some time. However, the objective is to discuss the possibility of related or linked mechanisms that may exist through these basic disease hallmarks that we often classify as absolute signatures of one disease. These new perspectives will be discussed in the context of a new paradigm for Alzheimer's disease that implicates heavy metals as a primary cause. Plausible links between these distinctly different pathologies are presented showing intersections of their distinct pathologies that hinge on metal interactions.",

    "abstract": "Genetic polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to Parkinson's disease (PD) have been described in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). To explore the potential contribution of mtDNA mutations to the risk of PD in a Chinese population, we examined the linkage relationship between several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in mtDNA and PD. We genotyped 5 SNPs located on coding genes using PCR-RFLP analysis. A specific allele 10398G demonstrated an increased risk of PD (OR 1.30; 95% CI 0.95-1.76; P = 0.013). After stratification by gender, the increased risk appeared to be more significant in females (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.16-3.16; P = 0.001). But the significance only appeared in females under Bonferroni correction. No significant differences were detected for other SNPs (T4336C, G5460A, G9055A, and G13708A). Individual haplotype composed of 4336T-5460G-9055G-10398A-13708G was found to be associated with protective effect regarding PD (P = 0.0025). The haplotypes 4336T-5460G-9055G-10398G-13708G and 4336T-5460G-9055G-10398A-13708G were more significantly associated in females (P = 0.0036 for risk and P = 0.0006 for protective effects). These data suggest that the A10398G and two haplotypes coupled with 10398A or 10398G are closely associated with susceptibility to PD in a northern Chinese population. This association demonstrated a female genetic distribution bias.",

    "abstract": "Dysphagia and associated aspiration pneumonia are commonly reported sequelae of Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies of swallowing in patients with PD have described prolonged pharyngeal transit time, delayed onset of pharyngeal transit, cricopharyngeal (CP) achalasia, reduced pharyngeal constriction, and slowed hyolaryngeal elevation. These studies were completed using inconsistent evaluation methodology, reliance on qualitative analysis, and a lack of a large control group, resulting in concerns regarding diagnostic precision. The purpose of this study was to investigate swallowing function in patients with PD using a norm-referenced, quantitative approach.\nThis retrospective study includes 34 patients with a diagnosis of PD referred to a multidisciplinary voice and swallowing clinic. Modified barium swallow studies were performed using quantitative measures of pharyngeal transit time, hyoid displacement, CP sphincter opening, area of the pharynx at maximal constriction, and timing of laryngeal vestibule closure relative to bolus arrival at the CP sphincter.\nReduced pharyngeal constriction was found in 30.4%, and a delay in airway closure relative to arrival of the bolus at the CP sphincter was the most common abnormality, present in 62% of patients. Previously reported findings of prolonged pharyngeal transit, poor hyoid elevation, and CP achalasia were not identified as prominent features.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment is common in nondemented Parkinson disease patients (PD-MCI) and is considered as a risk factor for dementia (PDD). Recently, the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) published guidelines for PD-MCI, although the studies available are still limited. The aim of this work was to characterize PD-MCI and its progression to dementia. Moreover, the study variables could be considered as predictors for the progression of cognitive impairment.\nThe study included 43 patients with idiopathic PD (mean age = 59.19 years, SD = 9.64) and 20 healthy and neurologically normal controls (mean age = 60.85 years, SD = 12.26). The criteria proposed by the MDS Task Force were applied for the PD-MCI diagnosis. Follow-up assessments were conducted within six to eight years after the diagnosis of PD-MCI.\nThe results showed that 60.5% of the patients were diagnosed with PD-MCI when a comprehensive assessment was performed (MDS criteria Level 2), while 23.3% of the patients met MCI criteria when a brief assessment was used (MDS criteria Level 1). Multiple domain impairment was the most frequent impairment (96.2%). A total of 42.3% of PD-MCI patients had dementia in the follow-up study. Logistic regression showed that the Hoehn and Yahr stage and education significantly contributed to the prediction of PD-MCI. Moreover, the Hoehn and Yahr stage and memory domain significantly contributed to the prediction of dementia.\nThe results of the study: (a) provide relevant data about the process of validation of the MDS PD-MCI criteria, (b) reinforce the hypothesis that PD-MCI is more frequent than previous studies showed without applying MDS criteria, and (c) confirm that PD-MCI is a risk factor for the onset of dementia. Finally, the study shows that neurological impairment, educational level and memory impairment were predictors for the progression of cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Multiple genetic variants have been linked to risk of Parkinson disease (PD), but known mutations do not explain a large proportion of the total PD cases. Similarly, multiple loci have been associated with PD risk by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The influence that genetic factors confer on phenotypic diversity remains unclear. Few studies have been performed to determine whether the GWAS loci are also associated with age at onset (AAO) or motor progression. We used 2 PD case-control data sets (Washington University and the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative) to determine whether polymorphisms located at the GWAS top hits (GBA, ACMSD/TMEM163, STK39, MCCC1/LAMP3, GAK/TMEM175, SNCA, and MAPT) show association with AAO or motor progression. We found associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms at the GBA and MAPT loci and PD AAO and progression. These findings reinforce the complex genetic basis of PD and suggest that distinct genes and variants explain the genetic architecture of PD risk, onset, and progression.",

    "abstract": "This review describes the oculo-visual problems likely to be encountered in Parkinson's disease (PD) with special reference to three questions: (1) are there visual symptoms characteristic of the prodromal phase of PD, (2) is PD dementia associated with specific visual changes, and (3) can visual symptoms help in the differential diagnosis of the parkinsonian syndromes, viz. PD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD)? Oculo-visual dysfunction in PD can involve visual acuity, dynamic contrast sensitivity, colour discrimination, pupil reactivity, eye movement, motion perception, and visual processing speeds. In addition, disturbance of visuo-spatial orientation, facial recognition problems, and chronic visual hallucinations may be present. Prodromal features of PD may include autonomic system dysfunction potentially affecting pupil reactivity, abnormal colour vision, abnormal stereopsis associated with postural instability, defects in smooth pursuit eye movements, and deficits in visuo-motor adaptation, especially when accompanied by idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder. PD dementia is associated with the exacerbation of many oculo-visual problems but those involving eye movements, visuo-spatial function, and visual hallucinations are most characteristic. Useful diagnostic features in differentiating the parkinsonian symptoms are the presence of visual hallucinations, visuo-spatial problems, and variation in saccadic eye movement dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment and dementia are common, clinically important features of Parkinson's disease (PD). The underlying disease pathology is heterogeneous and not yet well characterized. Biomarkers for cognitive impairment in PD could aid in diagnostic and prognostic evaluation and in the development of new cognitive enhancing treatments.\nTo examine the relationship between CSF markers and cognition in a large, multicenter, cohort study of early, untreated PD, and compare marker concentrations between PD patients with and without MCI and healthy, age-matched controls.\n414 early, untreated PD (34% with mild cognitive impairment) and 189 healthy, cognitively intact controls with baseline neuropsychological testing and CSF abeta42, t-tau, p-tau181 and \u03b1-synuclein results were included. Multiple linear regression models were constructed with a composite cognition factor, or memory-, or visuospatial- or executive-attention domains as dependent variables, and CSF markers, demographic characteristics and MDS-UPDRS III score as predictors.\nLower \u03b1-synuclein was associated with reduced performance on the executive-attention domain and the composite cognition factor in the whole PD-group. Abeta42 was significantly decreased in PD with mild cognitive impairment compared with controls after adjusting for covariates, while values in PD without MCI were identical to healthy controls.\nThe association between reduced CSF \u03b1-synuclein concentrations and cognition suggests that \u03b1-synuclein pathology contributes to early cognitive impairment in PD, in particular to executive-attentional dysfunction. Longitudinal analyses are needed to determine if this and other CSF biomarkers in early Parkinson's disease are associated with the risk of future cognitive decline and dementia.",

    "abstract": "Activity performance is marked by the degenerative nature of Parkinson's disease (PD), but few qualitative studies have focused on how people with PD perceive participation in life situations.\nTo identify and describe barriers and facilitators for participation from the perspective of people with PD.\nQualitative data was obtained by the focus group method using a semi-structured interview guide. Participants were recruited by purposeful sampling until saturation was reached. Homogeneity within each focus group was based on self-rated PD severity (mild, moderate, severe). Nine focus groups (three per PD severity level) included a total of 29 participants.\nComplex dynamics between the individual and the physical and social environment create barriers and facilitators for participation as described in the four categories which emerged out of the focus group discussions. The category Ambiguity of attitudes and the support of others describes how attitudes and support of other people act both as facilitators and barriers for participation. PD specific complexity of the body and physical environment interaction describes barriers for participation. Facilitators emerged in the two categories PD expertise in health care and social services and Information and education foster PD specific understanding.\nOur findings imply several potential means to facilitate participation for people with PD, taking the person as well as the environment into account in person-centred interventions. This involves aspects such as having access to PD specific expertise, increasing the knowledge and thereby the understanding of PD as well as providing support for maintained work-life.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). We previously identified tetranectin (TET) as a potential biomarker for PD whose expression is downregulated in the cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients. In the present study, we investigate the role of TET in neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that siRNA knockdown of TET decreased cell viability and the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells, whereas it increased caspase-3 activity and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in cultured primary dopaminergic neurons. Overexpression of TET protected dopaminergic neurons against neuronal apoptosis in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium cell culture model in vitro. In TET knockdown mouse model of PD, TET gene deletion decreased the number of TH positive cells in the SNpc, induced apoptosis via the p53/Bax pathway, and significantly impaired the motor behavior of transgenic mice. The findings suggest that TET plays a neuroprotective role via reducing neuron apoptosis and could be a valuable biomarker or potential therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Electrophysiological studies indicate altered contrast processing in some Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. We recently demonstrated that vision is altered in Drosophila PD models and hypothesised that different types of genetic and idiopathic PD may affect dopaminergic visual signalling pathways differently. Here we asked whether visual responses in Drosophila could be used to identify PD mutations. To mimic a clinical setting a range of flies was used. Young flies from four control lines were compared to three early-onset PD mutations (PINK1, DJ-1\u03b1 and DJ-1\u03b2), and to two other neurodegenerative mutations, one in the fly LRRK2 orthologue (dLRRK) the other in eggroll, a model of general neurodegeneration in Drosophila. Stimuli were contrast reversing gratings spanning 64 spatiotemporal frequency combinations. We recorded the steady-state visually-evoked response amplitude across all combinations. We found that the pattern of neuronal responses differed between genotypes. Wild-type and early-onset PD flies formed separate clusters; the late-onset mutation is an outlier. Neuronal responses in early-onset PD flies were stronger than in wild-types. Multivariate pattern analysis grouped flies by PD/non-PD genotype with an accuracy >85%. We propose that machine learning algorithms may be useful in increasing the diagnostic specificity of human electrophysiological measurements in both animal models and PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia are associated with alterations of basal ganglia motor circuits and abnormal neuronal activity in the output nucleus, the globus pallidus internus (GPi). This study aims to compare the electrophysiological hallmarks for PD and dystonia in the linear and non-linear time stamp domains in patients who underwent microelectrode recordings during functional stereotactic surgery for deep brain stimulation (DBS) or pallidotomy. We analyzed single-unit neuronal activity in the posteroventral lateral region of the GPi in awake patients prior to pallidotomy or the implantation of DBS electrodes in 29 patients with PD (N\u00a0=\u00a083 neurons) and 13 patients with dystonia (N\u00a0=\u00a041 neurons) under comparable conditions. The discharge rate and the instantaneous frequency of the GPi in dystonia patients were significantly lower than in PD patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), while the total number of bursts, the percentage of spikes in bursts and the mean duration of bursts were higher (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Further, non-linear analysis revealed higher irregularity or entropy in the data streams of GPi neurons of PD patients compared to the dystonia patients group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). This study indicates that both linear and non-linear features of neuronal activity in the human GPi differ between PD and dystonia. Our results may serve as the basis for future studies on linear and non-linear analysis of neuronal firing patterns in various movement disorders.",

    "abstract": "The ability to recognize and interpret emotions in others is a crucial prerequisite of adequate social behavior. Impairments in emotion processing have been reported from the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aims to characterize emotion recognition in advanced Parkinson's disease (APD) candidates for deep-brain stimulation and to compare emotion recognition abilities in visual and auditory domains.\nAPD patients, defined as those with levodopa-induced motor complications (N = 42), and healthy controls (N = 43) matched by gender, age, and educational level, undertook the Comprehensive Affect Testing System (CATS), a battery that evaluates recognition of seven basic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, and neutral) on facial expressions and four emotions on prosody (happiness, sadness, anger, and fear). APD patients were assessed during the \"ON\" state. Group performance was compared with independent-samples t tests.\nCompared to controls, APD had significantly lower scores on the discrimination and naming of emotions in prosody, and visual discrimination of neutral faces, but no significant differences in visual emotional tasks.\nThe contrasting performance in emotional processing between visual and auditory stimuli suggests that APD candidates for surgery have either a selective difficulty in recognizing emotions in prosody or a general defect in prosody processing. Studies investigating early-stage PD, and the effect of subcortical lesions in prosody processing, favor the latter interpretation. Further research is needed to understand these deficits in emotional prosody recognition and their possible contribution to later behavioral or neuropsychiatric manifestations of PD.",

    "abstract": "Healthy subjects scale grip force to match the load defined by physical object properties such as weight, or dynamic properties such as inertia. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) show an elevated grip force in dynamic object handling, but temporal aspects of anticipatory grip force control are relatively preserved. In PD patients, beta frequency oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia is suppressed prior to externally paced movements. However, the role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in anticipatory grip force control is not known.\nAfter implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes in the STN, PD patients performed adaptive and voluntary grip force tasks, while we recorded subthalamic local field potentials (LFP) and scalp EEG.\nDuring adaptive grip force control (Shake), we found event related desynchronization (ERD) in the beta frequency band, which was time-locked to the grip force. In contrast, during voluntary grip force control (Press) we recorded a biphasic ERD, corresponding to peak grip force and grip force release. Beta synchronization between STN and cortical EEG was reduced during adaptive grip force control.\nThe time-locked suppression of beta oscillatory activity in the STN is in line with previous reports of beta ERD prior to voluntary movements. Our results show that the STN is involved in anticipatory grip force control in PD patients. The difference in the phasic beta ERD between the two tasks and the reduction of cortico-subthalamic synchronization suggests that qualitatively different neuronal network states are involved in different grip force control tasks.",

    "abstract": "Cortex-basal ganglia circuits participate in motor timing and temporal perception, and are important for the dynamic configuration of sensorimotor networks in response to exogenous demands. In Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) induces motor performance benefits. Hitherto, little is known concerning contributions of the basal ganglia to sensory facilitation and cortical responses to RAS in PD. Therefore, we conducted an EEG study in 12 PD patients before and after surgery for subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) and in 12 age-matched controls. Here we investigated the effects of levodopa and STN-DBS on resting-state EEG and on the cortical-response profile to slow and fast RAS in a passive-listening paradigm focusing on beta-band oscillations, which are important for auditory-motor coupling. The beta-modulation profile to RAS in healthy participants was characterized by local peaks preceding and following auditory stimuli. In PD patients RAS failed to induce pre-stimulus beta increases. The absence of pre-stimulus beta-band modulation may contribute to impaired rhythm perception in PD. Moreover, post-stimulus beta-band responses were highly abnormal during fast RAS in PD patients. Treatment with levodopa and STN-DBS reinstated a post-stimulus beta-modulation profile similar to controls, while STN-DBS reduced beta-band power in the resting-state. The treatment-sensitivity of beta oscillations suggests that STN-DBS may specifically improve timekeeping functions of cortical beta oscillations during fast auditory pacing.",

    "abstract": "Differentiating between Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS) is still a challenge, specially at early stages when the patients show similar symptoms. During last years, several computer systems have been proposed in order to improve the diagnosis of PD, but their accuracy is still limited. In this work we demonstrate a full automatic computer system to assist the diagnosis of PD using (18)F-DMFP PET data. First, a few regions of interest are selected by means of a two-sample t-test. The accuracy of the selected regions to separate PD from APS patients is then computed using a support vector machine classifier. The accuracy values are finally used to train a Bayesian network that can be used to predict the class of new unseen data. This methodology was evaluated using a database with 87 neuroimages, achieving accuracy rates over 78%. A fair comparison with other similar approaches is also provided.",

    "abstract": "The modified-Chungsimyeolda-tang (DG) is an important traditional Korean herbal formula used in traditional oriental medicine for treatment of cerebrovascular disorders, including stroke. The formula is based on the book \"Dongui Sasang Shinpyun\".\nIn the previous studies, the neuroprotective effect of DG is demonstrated in an in vitro Parkinson's disease (PD) model, and in this study, the 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) animal model of PD is used to evaluate the behavioral effect of DG and possible mechanism through anti-apoptosis of DG. 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) also is used to evaluate the anti-apoptosis effect of DG in SH-SY5Y cells.\nMPTP was used to evaluate the behavioral damage and neurotoxicity in mice. The bradykinesia symptom was measured by a Pole test and a Rota-rod test in mice. Also the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons induced by MPTP was examined by an immunohistochemical assay. The DG-mediated anti-apoptosis effect was measured using an immunoblotting assay with apoptosis-related markers such as Bax and cleaved caspase-3. DG and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) were co-treated with primary dopaminergic neurons to evaluate the protective effect of DG. The expression of caspase-3 and PARP was measured to detect the protective effect of DG from the damage by 6-OHDA.\nThe treatment with DG resulted in prophylactic effects on MPTP-induced Parkinsonian bradykinesia and the immunohistochemical analysis showed that DG provided the neuroprotection against the MPP(+)-induced dopaminergic neurons loss through the anti-apoptosis effect. The present results suggested that it might be possible to use DG for the prevention of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) degeneration induced by exposure to the toxic substances, such as MPTP/MPP(+), in PD mouse model.",

    "abstract": "To determine the kinematics and coordination while performing reach-to-grasp (RTG) actions under barrier avoidance condition in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nRight handed idiopathic PDs (Hoehn and Yahr stage 2-3) (n = 20) and age-matched controls (n = 10) without dementia and psychological impairment were recruited. They were asked to perform RTG \"as soon as you see the light and as fast as you can\" with their right hands under barrier condition. The RTG performance were assessed in three domains, planning, execution (or kinematics), and coordination. The planning was measured by reaction time. The kinematics variables were movement time, maximum velocity, time to maximum velocity, deceleration time, maximum aperture, time to maximum aperture, aperture closure time, and aperture closure distance. The coordination was assessed using a cross correlation analysis between transport velocity and aperture size, which consisted of maximal correlation coefficient (rmax) and associated time lag (Tmax).\nCompared to the controls, the PD group had delayed planning. In execution domain, they showed decreased maximum velocity, smaller amplitude of maximum aperture, and prolonged all raw times comparing to controls. When considering the coordination, they had only prolonged T. than controls.\nPD participants with mild to moderate impairment showedpoorer RTG planning, execution, and coordination during barrier avoidance when compared to age-matched controls.",

Having observed a patient interacting with imaginary strips of skin in his hands at our movement disorders unit, we prospectively studied PD patients and caregivers over a 6-month period using a semistructured interview addressed to this particular phenomenon. Demographic characteristics as well as cognitive and motor function were assessed. A total of 7 of 164 PD patients (4.3%) observed during the study period had string hallucinations. One patient was cognitively intact and the other 6 had some degree of cognitive impairment. Common to the phenomenology of the hallucinations was the unpleasant feeling and vision of threads emerging from the subjects' hands. Patients interacted with these \"threads,\" trying to remove them from their hands. Our study identifies a previously undescribed type of hallucinations in PD, characterized by a complex pattern of multimodal tactile and visual hallucinations.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients frequently have an impairment of facial expression both in voluntary and spontaneous emotional expression. Aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a rehabilitation program for hypomimia in patients with PD, comparing two different approaches. Thirty-six patients with PD were included: 20 patients received a rehabilitative intervention for hypomimia either with a DVD showing exercises focused on facial muscles (PD-group-A) or with a therapist-guided facial rehabilitation with a proprioceptive/recognition approach (PD-group-B). Sixteen patients (PD-Ctrl group) did not receive any treatment and served as control group. The feasibility of the proposed rehabilitation techniques was the main focus of this evaluation. We also evaluate the efficacy of the treatments by means of the sub-item 19 of the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale motor score (UPDRS-III) and by a computerized analysis of facial expression (E-Motion), which was assessed prior to (T0) and after therapy (T1). The proposed rehabilitative program for the treatment of hypomimia was shown to be feasible. Our data show a significant improvement in UPDRS-III sub-item 19 in PD-group-B compared to PD-group-A, (p = 0.005) and to PD-Ctrl (p = 0.003) and in expressivity of fear in PD-group-B compared to PD-Ctrl (p = 0.01). The proposed rehabilitative program showed to be feasible. A larger multi-center trial is now warranted to establish its efficacy to improve facial expression over long time period.",

    "abstract": "Since the new German Apothekenbetriebsordnung was released, medication therapy management (MTM) has increased in importance. MTM is intended to improve the quality of life of patients.\nThe aim of this study was to improve the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease through an MTM by a community pharmacist.\nThe patients were recruited in cooperation with the Deutsche Parkinson Vereinigung e.V. (dPV) in Germany. Methods All patients were evaluated at baseline (t0) and after a follow-up of 4 months (t1). During the intervention period, the pharmacists implemented an MTM with standardized pharmaceutical care. Main outcome measure The effects of the interventions were measured by the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).\nIn this study, 90 patients with Parkinson's disease were included. The most common intervention was to find a therapy for untreated comorbidities. The UPDRS or MDS-UPDRS improved significantly after the intervention period by a median change rate of 1 (p < 0.05) or rather 2 (p < 0.05) compared to the baseline.\nThe study shows that the quality of life in Parkinson's disease patients improved significantly through MTM.",

    "abstract": "There is a paucity of information on cardiovascular responses with regard to the disease stage of Parkinson's disease (PD) when using an exercise test. Our purpose was to examine whether cardiovascular responses to the treadmill exercise test differed among persons with PD who have different disease severity.\nForty-five subjects with PD were studied (34 men and 11 women). The subjects underwent a treadmill exercise test using a modified Bruce protocol. Resting heart rate (HR), resting blood pressure (BP), maximal HR, maximal BP, exercise duration, maximum percentage HR and METs achieved after the treadmill exercise test were studied.\nSeventeen subjects were in Hoehn and Yahr Staging Scale (HY) 2, 16 were in HY 2.5, and 12 were in HY 3. HR increased significantly in all three stages. Systolic BP increased significantly in the HY 2 and 2.5, but not the HY 3. Diastolic BP did not change in any stage. Resting HR was lower in the HY 2 compared to the HY 3 and resting systolic BP was higher in HY 2 compared to the HY 2.5. The three HY stages were not different in exercise duration, HR and BP responses, maximum percentage HR achieved, and METs achieved. Fatigue was a primary reason to discontinue the test. There were no fall incidents in any of the tests.\nCardiovascular responses to the treadmill exercise test did not vary with disease severity. Treadmill exercise tests were safe to perform in persons with PD.",

    "abstract": "More than 80\u00a0% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) develop dysphagia during the course of their disease. Swallowing impairment reduces quality of life, complicates medication intake and leads to malnutrition and aspiration pneumonia, which is a major cause of death in PD. Although the underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood, it has been shown that dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic mechanisms are involved in the development of dysphagia in PD. Clinical assessment of dysphagia in PD patients is challenging and often delivers unreliable results. A modified water test assessing maximum swallowing volume is recommended to uncover oropharyngeal dysphagia in PD. PD-specific questionnaires may also be useful to identify patients at risk for swallowing impairment. Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing and videofluoroscopic swallowing study are both considered to be the gold standard for evaluation of PD-related dysphagia. In addition, high-resolution manometry may be a helpful tool. These instrumental methods allow a reliable detection of aspiration events. Furthermore, typical patterns of impairment during the oral, pharyngeal and/or esophageal swallowing phase of PD patients can be identified. Therapy of dysphagia in PD consists of pharmacological interventions and swallowing treatment by speech and language therapists (SLTs). Fluctuating dysphagia with deterioration during the off-state should be treated by optimizing dopaminergic medication. The methods used during swallowing treatment by SLTs shall be selected according to the individual dysphagia pattern of each PD patient. A promising novel method is an intensive training of expiratory muscle strength. Deep brain stimulation does not seem to have a clinical relevant effect on swallowing function in PD. The goal of this review is giving an overview on current stages of epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of PD-associated dysphagia, which might be helpful for neurologists, speech-language therapists, and other clinicians in their daily work with PD patients and associated swallowing difficulties. Furthermore areas with an urgent need for future clinical research are identified.",

    "abstract": "Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity is a promising biomarker for Parkinson disease (PD). Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity has previously been established as a useful diagnostic criterion in several European and Asian patient cohorts. However, diagnostic cutoff values for substantia nigra hyperechogenicity remain unknown for most patient populations. This study validated the diagnostic accuracy of substantia nigra hyperechogenicity in a large cohort of patients with PD in Estonia.\nThe study included 300 patients with PD from Estonia, representing 10% of the national PD patient population, and 200 healthy control participants. To define the optimal cutoff value in the PD cohort, data from a single assessment versus repetitive assessments by transcranial sonography were compared. With the use of 3 repetitive assessments, the diagnostic accuracy of the data was measured. In addition, calculations for percentile values were used to define substantia nigra hyperechogenicity among controls.\nOur data showed that the multiassessment approach yielded higher diagnostic accuracy than a single assessment (P = .021). The highest diagnostic accuracy was achieved by using the measurement mean to define substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, which was 0.23 cm(2) (sensitivity, 88.7%; specificity, 92.2%), whereas single measurements detected PD with higher sensitivity (sensitivity, 93.2%; specificity, 85.1%). No significant difference was found between mean and median measurements (P= .18).\nThis study indicates the diagnostic merit of transcranial sonography in PD diagnosis in an additional population and demonstrates that transcranial sonography of the substantia nigra is a relevant and useful diagnostic tool for patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Memory formation is proposed to be a dual process that involves the simultaneous memorisation of both detailed information (item-specific memory) and gist information (gist memory). Memory deficits have been reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD); however, few studies have explicitly addressed the nature of these deficits. To obtain a detailed understanding of memory dysfunction in patients with PD, it is of crucial importance to establish whether item-specific memory and gist memory performance are impaired. The aim of this study is to explore whether gist memory and item-specific memory performance are still intact in patients with PD, as well as to determine which psychological mechanisms are responsible for memory formation.\nTwo hospitals in northern Taiwan.\nThirty-nine patients with PD and 28 normal controls were recruited. Each participant received a gist-based recognition test following the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm, as well as neuropsychological tests and measures of clinical characteristics.\nGist memory was impaired in patients with advanced-stage disease (Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage: III) (F2,64=3.58, p=0.033), whereas item-specific memory was preserved throughout all disease stages. Correlation analysis showed that item-specific memory was related to executive functions in normal controls and early-stage patients with PD (H&Y stage: I-II); however, item-specific memory was related to episodic memory, rather than to executive functions, in advanced-stage patients with PD. Moreover, gist memory was related to episodic memory, but only in early-stage patients with PD.\nWe discovered that impaired gist memory is found in advanced-stage, but not in early-stage, patients with PD. Our findings suggest that the techniques used to take advantage of the relatively preserved gist memory in early-stage patients with PD, as well as the preserved item-specific memory in patients with PD of all stages, could be useful for memory rehabilitation programmes.",

    "abstract": "Visual and auditory cueing improve functional performance in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, audiovisual processing shares many cognitive resources used for attention-dependent tasks such as communication, spatial orientation, and balance. Conversely, tactile cues (TC) may be processed faster, with minimal attentional demand, and may be more efficient means for modulating motor-cognitive performance. In this study we aimed to investigate the efficacy and limitations of TC for modulating simple (heel tapping) and more complex (walking) motor tasks (1) over a range of cueing intervals, (2) with/without a secondary motor task (holding tray with cups of water).\nTen PD patients (71 \u00b1 9 years) and 10 healthy controls (69 \u00b1 7 years) participated in the study. TCs was delivered through a smart phone attached to subjects' dominant arm and were controlled by a custom-developed Android application.\nPD patients and healthy controls were able to use TC to modulate heel tapping (F(3.8,1866.1) = 1008.1, p < 0.001), and partially modulate walking (F(3.5,1448.7) = 187.5, p < 0.001) tasks. In the walking task, PD patients modulated performance over a narrower range of cueing intervals (R(2) = 0.56) than healthy controls (R(2) = 0.84; group difference F(3.5,1448.7) = 8.6, p < 0.001). TC diminished synchronization error associated with performance of secondary motor task during walking in PD patients and healthy controls (main effect of Task (F(1,494) = 0.4; p = 0.527), Task X Group interaction (F(1,494) = 0.5; p = 0.493)).\nThis study expands modalities of TC usage for movement modulation and motor-cognitive integration in PD patients. The smartphone TC application was validated as a user-friendly movement modulation aid.",

    "abstract": "Binding of human \u03b1-Synuclein, a protein associated with Parkinson's disease, to natural membranes is thought to be crucial in relation to its pathological and physiological function. Here the binding of \u03b1S to small unilamellar vesicles mimicking the inner mitochondrial and the neuronal plasma membrane is studied in situ by continuous wave and pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance. Local binding information of \u03b1S spin labeled by MTSL at positions 56 and 69 respectively shows that also helix 2 (residues 50-100) binds firmly to both membranes. By double electron-electron resonance (DEER) on the mutant spin labeled at positions 27 and 56 (\u03b1S 27/56) a new conformation on the membrane is found with a distance of 3.6 nm/ 3.7 nm between residues 27 and 56. In view of the low negative charge density of these membranes, the strong interaction is surprising, emphasizing that function and pathology of \u03b1S could involve synaptic vesicles and mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease can be emotionally and psychologically challenging to patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between Parkinson's disease and depression and the impact of the disease stage and patients' age and gender on this association.\nThis is a cross-sectional retrospective study on 200 patients aged above 35 years old from 10 different nationalities.\nDepression was diagnosed in 46% of the patients enrolled. Most of these patients were treated with an antidepressant. Young age, female gender, and moderate Parkinson's disease stage were found to be significantly associated with depression (odds ratio of 1.19, 1.23, and 1.22, respectively, p < .05).\nThis study, the first of its kind in Lebanon and the Middle East and North Africa region, highlights the importance of studying depression in Parkinson's disease and the need for identifying and treating depression symptoms when treating Parkinson's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "Safinamide (Xadago\u2122) is an oral \u03b1-aminoamide derivative marketed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). The drug has both dopaminergic properties, namely highly selective and reversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase B, and nondopamimetic properties, namely selective sodium channel blockade and calcium channel modulation, with consequent inhibition of excessive glutamate release. In 2014, safinamide was approved in the European Economic Area, as \"an add-on therapy to stable dose levodopa, alone or in combination with other PD therapies in mid- to late-stage-fluctuating PD patients.\" In addition, evidence has been provided for safinamide in the treatment of motor symptoms in early PD patients. This article summarizes the pharmacological properties, development program, clinical indications for PD treatment, stratified according to several disease's stages and the safety profile of safinamide. A meta-analysis of the most frequent adverse events among Phase III trials has been also performed.",

    "abstract": "Neurological assessment of a patient with Parkinson's disease (PD) is expected to reflect upon functional performance. As women are known to report more limitations even for same observed functional performance level, present study was designed to examine whether associations between neurological assessments and functional performance differ across genders.\n14 men and 14 women with PD participated. Functional performance was assessed by measuring walking speeds on 10-meter walk test (10MWT) and by performing timed-up-and-go-test (TUG). Neurological assessment included Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HY), Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale (S-E), and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE).\nIn women with PD, Kendall's tau-b correlation analyses revealed significant correlations between functional performance tests and neurological assessment measures, with the exception in MMSE. No corresponding associations were found for men, although they demonstrated better functional performance, as expected.\nMen in similar clinical stage of the PD perform better on functional tests than women. Disease severity reflects upon functional performance differently in men and women with PD. Results indicate that when interpreting the assessment results of both functional performance and neurological assessment tests, the gender of the patient should be taken into consideration.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged L-dopa treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD) often leads to the expression of abnormal involuntary movements known as L-dopa-induced dyskinesia. Recently, dramatic 80 Hz oscillatory local field potential (LFP) activity within the primary motor cortex has been linked to dyskinetic symptoms in a rodent model of PD and attributed to stimulation of cortical dopamine D1 receptors. To characterize the relationship between high gamma (70-110 Hz) cortical activity and the development of L-dopa-induced dyskinesia, cortical LFP and spike signals were recorded in hemiparkinsonian rats treated with L-dopa for 7 days, and dyskinesia was quantified using the abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) scale. The relationship between high gamma and dyskinesia was further probed by assessment of the effects of pharmacological agents known to induce or modulate dyskinesia expression. Findings demonstrate that AIMs and high gamma LFP power increase between days 1 and 7 of L-dopa priming. Notably, high beta (25-35 Hz) power associated with parkinsonian bradykinesia decreased as AIMs and high gamma LFP power increased during priming. After priming, rats were treated with the D1 agonist SKF81297 and the D2 agonist quinpirole. Both dopamine agonists independently induced AIMs and high gamma cortical activity that were similar to that induced by L-dopa, showing that this LFP activity is neither D1 nor D2 receptor specific. The serotonin 1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT reduced L-dopa- and DA agonist-induced AIMs and high gamma power to varying degrees, while the serotonin 1A antagonist WAY100635 reversed these effects. Unexpectedly, as cortical high gamma power increased, phase locking of cortical pyramidal spiking to high gamma oscillations decreased, raising questions regarding the neural substrate(s) responsible for high gamma generation and the functional correlation between high gamma and dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine agonists (DAs) are commonly used in the therapy of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, several observational studies have suggested a putative association between DAs and specific cardiac adverse events.\nThe aim of this study was to systematically review and summarize the available epidemiologic evidence on the association between use of ergot- and non-ergot-derived DAs and the risk of valvular heart disease, specifically cardiac valve regurgitation (CVR) and heart failure (HF) in patients with PD.\nThe databases MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE were searched for all relevant articles published before February 2015. Studies were eligible if they met the following inclusion criteria: exposure to any approved non-ergot- or ergot-derived DA, presentation of original data, inclusion of an unexposed reference group, and valvular heart disease or heart failure as the primary outcome of interest.\nThirteen publications for CVR were identified (two nested case-control, one cohort and ten cross-sectional studies). Compared with non-ergot DAs or other anti-parkinsonian drugs, exposure to ergot-derived DAs pergolide and cabergoline was associated with an increased risk of CVR among PD patients. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) in the nested case-control and cohort studies ranged from 2.00 to 7.10 and 4.58 to 4.90, respectively. Longer treatment duration and higher dose of those DAs was also associated with a higher risk of CVR. Risk of HF was estimated in three nested case-control studies and one cohort study. Use of cabergoline (IRR range 1.30-2.39) and the non-ergot-derived DA pramipexole (IRR range 1.40-1.81) was associated with a higher HF risk among patients with PD. Pergolide may also be associated with a higher risk of HF.\nDespite the heterogeneous methodological approaches of the included studies, there is strong evidence that treatment with pergolide and cabergoline is associated with a higher risk of CVR, and moderate evidence that treatment with pramipexole and cabergoline is associated with a higher risk of HF in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "results": "Thirteen publications for CVR were identified (two nested case-control, one cohort and ten cross-sectional studies). Compared with non-ergot DAs or other anti-parkinsonian drugs, exposure to ergot-derived DAs pergolide and cabergoline was associated with an increased risk of CVR among PD patients. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) in the nested case-control and cohort studies ranged from 2.00 to 7.10 and 4.58 to 4.90, respectively. Longer treatment duration and higher dose of those DAs was also associated with a higher risk of CVR. Risk of HF was estimated in three nested case-control studies and one cohort study. Use of cabergoline (IRR range 1.30-2.39) and the non-ergot-derived DA pramipexole (IRR range 1.40-1.81) was associated with a higher HF risk among patients with PD. Pergolide may also be associated with a higher risk of HF.",

    "abstract": "Motor complications may become major challenges in the management of patients with Parkinson's disease. In this study, we sought to determine the incidence, risk factors, evolution, and treatment of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias in a population-representative, incident Parkinson's disease cohort.\nIn this prospective population-based 5-year longitudinal study, we followed 189 incident and initially drug-na\u00efve Parkinson's disease patients biannually for detailed examination of dyskinesias and motor fluctuations as defined by the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses to assess cumulative incidence and risk factors of these motor complications.\nThe 5-year cumulative incidence of motor complications was 52.4%. Motor fluctuations occurred in 42.9% and dyskinesias in 24.3%. Besides higher motor severity predicting both motor fluctuations (p = 0.016) and dyskinesias (p < 0.001), lower age at diagnosis predicted motor fluctuations (p = 0.001), whereas female gender predicted dyskinesias (p = 0.001). Actual levodopa dose at onset of motor fluctuations (p = 0.037) or dyskinesias (p < 0.001) rather than initial treatment with levodopa (p > 0.1) independently predicted development of motor complications. Motor fluctuations reversed in 37% and dyskinesias in 49% of patients on oral treatment and remained generally mild in those with persistent complications. No patients received device-aided therapies during the study.\nMore than 50% in the general Parkinson's disease population develop motor complications within 5 years of diagnosis. However, they remain mild in the vast majority and are reversible in a substantial proportion of patients.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate if early treatment with levodopa has a beneficial disease modifying effect on Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms and functional health, improves the ability to (maintain) work, and reduces the use of (informal) care, caregiver burden, and costs. Additionally, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of early levodopa treatment will be assessed.\nTo differentiate between the direct symptomatic effects and possible disease modifying effects of levodopa, we use a randomised delayed-start double-blind placebo-controlled multi-centre trial design. Patients with early stage PD whose functional health does not yet necessitate initiation of PD-medication will be randomised to either 40 weeks of treatment with levodopa/carbidopa 100/25 mg TID including 2 weeks of dose escalation or to 40 weeks placebo TID. Subsequently, all patients receive levodopa/carbidopa 100/25 mg TID for 40 weeks. There are 8 assessments: at baseline and at 4, 22, 40, 44, 56, 68, and 80 weeks. The primary outcome measure is the difference in the mean total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores between the early- and delayed-start groups at 80 weeks. Secondary outcome measures are rate of progression, the AMC Linear Disability Score, side effects, perceived quality of life with the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39, the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), ability to (maintain) work, the use of (informal) care, caregiver burden, and costs. 446 newly diagnosed PD patients without impaired functional health need to be recruited in order to detect a minimal clinical relevant difference of 4 points on the total UPDRS at 80 weeks.\nThe LEAP-study will provide insights into the possible disease modifying effects of early levodopa.\nISRCTN30518857, EudraCT number 2011-000678-72.",

    "abstract": "Although much progress have been made in recent years, the etiology of idiopathic Parkinson's disease remains obscure. The chance discovery that injection of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induces a syndrome very similar to parkinsonism introduced the \"environmental toxin\" hypothesis but no toxin was ever found in any quantity in patients' brains. We have unexpectedly now found, however, that, in mice, very low doses of MPTP induce as much dopaminergic neuronal death as far higher doses. Cellular detoxification mechanisms would appear to be incapacitated at such low doses. This could infer that the barely discernible presence of an unidentified neurotoxin may be responsible for the onset of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Balance dysfunctions are a major challenge in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have shown that rehabilitation can play a role in their treatment. In this study, we have compared the efficacy of two different devices for balance training: stabilometric platform and crossover. We have enrolled 60 PD patients randomly assigned to two groups. The first one (stabilometric group) performed a 4-week cycle of balance training, using the stabilometric platform, whereas the second one (crossover group) performed a 4-week cycle of balance training, using the crossover. The outcome measures used were Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part II, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up and Go (TUG), and Six Minutes Walking Test (6MWT). Results showed that TUG, BBS, and UPDRS II improved in both groups. There was not difference in the efficacy of the two balance treatments. Patients in both groups improved also the meters walked in the 6MWT at the end of rehabilitation, but the improvement was better for patients performing crossover training. Our results show that the crossover and the stabilometric platform have the same effect on balance dysfunction of Parkinsonian patients, while crossover gets better results on the walking capacity.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is frequently associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, mostly represented by constipation and defecatory dysfunctions. This study examined the impact of central dopaminergic denervation, induced by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle, on distal colonic excitatory cholinergic neuromotor activity in rats. Animals were euthanized 4 and 8 weeks after 6-OHDA injection. In vivo colonic transit was evaluated by radiologic assay. Electrically induced and carbachol-induced cholinergic contractions were recorded in vitro from longitudinal and circular muscle colonic preparations, whereas acetylcholine levels were assayed in the incubation media. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), HuC/D (pan-neuronal marker), muscarinic M2 and M3 receptors were assessed by immunohistochemistry or western blot assay. As compared with control rats, at week 4, 6-OHDA-treated animals displayed the following changes: decreased in vivo colonic transit rate, impaired electrically evoked neurogenic cholinergic contractions, enhanced carbachol-induced contractions, decreased basal and electrically stimulated acetylcholine release from colonic tissues, decreased ChAT immunopositivity in the neuromuscular layer, unchanged density of HuC/D immunoreactive myenteric neurons, and increased expression of colonic muscarinic M2 and M3 receptors. The majority of such alterations were also detected at week 8 post 6-OHDA injection. These findings indicate that central nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation is associated with an impaired excitatory neurotransmission characterized by a loss of myenteric neuronal ChAT positivity and decrease in acetylcholine release, resulting in a dysregulated smooth muscle motor activity, which likely contributes to the concomitant decrease in colonic transit rate.",

    "abstract": "Progressive supranuclear palsy and Parkinson's disease have distinct underlying neuropathology, but both diseases affect cognitive function in addition to causing a movement disorder. They impair response inhibition and may lead to impulsivity, which can occur even in the presence of profound akinesia and rigidity. The current study examined the mechanisms of cognitive impairments underlying disinhibition, using horizontal saccadic latencies that obviate the impact of limb slowness on executing response decisions. Nineteen patients with clinically diagnosed progressive supranuclear palsy (Richardson's syndrome), 24 patients with clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease and 26 healthy control subjects completed a saccadic Go/No-Go task with a head-mounted infrared saccadometer. Participants were cued on each trial to make a pro-saccade to a horizontal target or withhold their responses. Both patient groups had impaired behavioural performance, with more commission errors than controls. Mean saccadic latencies were similar between all three groups. We analysed behavioural responses as a binary decision between Go and No-Go choices. By using Bayesian parameter estimation, we fitted a hierarchical drift-diffusion model to individual participants' single trial data. The model decomposes saccadic latencies into parameters for the decision process: decision boundary, drift rate of accumulation, decision bias, and non-decision time. In a leave-one-out three-way classification analysis, the model parameters provided better discrimination between patients and controls than raw behavioural measures. Furthermore, the model revealed disease-specific deficits in the Go/No-Go decision process. Both patient groups had slower drift rate of accumulation, and shorter non-decision time than controls. But patients with progressive supranuclear palsy were strongly biased towards a pro-saccade decision boundary compared to Parkinson's patients and controls. This indicates a prepotency of responding in combination with a reduction in further accumulation of evidence, which provides a parsimonious explanation for the apparently paradoxical combination of disinhibition and severe akinesia. The combination of the well-tolerated oculomotor paradigm and the sensitivity of the model-based analysis provides a valuable approach for interrogating decision-making processes in neurodegenerative disorders. The mechanistic differences underlying participants' poor performance were not observable from classical analysis of behavioural data, but were clearly revealed by modelling. These differences provide a rational basis on which to develop and assess new therapeutic strategies for cognition and behaviour in these disorders.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with REM sleep behaviour disorder are at significantly higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease. Here we examined visual short-term memory deficits--long associated with Parkinson's disease--in patients with REM sleep behaviour disorder without Parkinson's disease using a novel task that measures recall precision. Visual short-term memory for sequentially presented coloured bars of different orientation was assessed in 21 patients with polysomnography-proven idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder, 26 cases with early Parkinson's disease and 26 healthy controls. Three tasks using the same stimuli controlled for attentional filtering ability, sensorimotor and temporal decay factors. Both patients with REM sleep behaviour disorder and Parkinson's disease demonstrated a deficit in visual short-term memory, with recall precision significantly worse than in healthy controls with no deficit observed in any of the control tasks. Importantly, the pattern of memory deficit in both patient groups was specifically explained by an increase in random responses. These results demonstrate that it is possible to detect the signature of memory impairment associated with Parkinson's disease in individuals with REM sleep behaviour disorder, a condition associated with a high risk of developing Parkinson's disease. The pattern of visual short-term memory deficit potentially provides a cognitive marker of 'prodromal' Parkinson's disease that might be useful in tracking disease progression and for disease-modifying intervention trials.",

    "abstract": "Oligomers of alpha-synuclein are toxic to cells and have been proposed to play a key role in the etiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. As certain missense mutations in the gene encoding for alpha-synuclein induce early-onset forms of the disease, it has been suggested that these variants might have an inherent tendency to produce high concentrations of oligomers during aggregation, although a direct experimental evidence for this is still missing. We used single-molecule F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer to visualize directly the protein self-assembly process by wild-type alpha-synuclein and A53T, A30P and E46K mutants and to compare the structural properties of the ensemble of oligomers generated. We found that the kinetics of oligomer formation correlates with the natural tendency of each variant to acquire beta-sheet structure. Moreover, A53T and A30P showed significant differences in the averaged FRET efficiency of one of the two types of oligomers formed compared to the wild-type oligomers, indicating possible structural variety among the ensemble of species generated. Importantly, we found similar concentrations of oligomers during the lag-phase of the aggregation of wild-type and mutated alpha-synuclein, suggesting that the properties of the ensemble of oligomers generated during self-assembly might be more relevant than their absolute concentration for triggering neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Postural instability is one of the most disabling features in Parkinson's disease (PD), and often leads to falls that reduce mobility and functional capacity. The objectives of this study were to analyse the limit of stability (LOS) and influence of the manipulation of visual, somatosensorial and visual-vestibular information on postural control in patients with PD and healthy subjects.\nCross-sectional.\nMovement Disorders Unit, university setting.\nEighty-two subjects aged between 37 and 83 years: 41 with Parkinson's disease in the 'on' state and 41 healthy subjects with no neurological disorders. Both groups were matched in terms of sex and age.\nUnified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-motor score, modified Hoehn and Yahr staging, Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) and posturography with integrated virtual reality. The parameters analysed by posturography were LOS area, area of body centre of pressure excursion and balance functional reserve in the standing position in 10 conditions (open and closed eyes, unstable surface with eyes closed, saccadic and optokinetic stimuli, and visual-vestibular interaction).\nThe mean UPDRS motor score and DGI score were 27 [standard deviation (SD) 14] and 21 (SD 3), respectively. Thirteen participants scored between 0 and 19 points, indicating major risk of falls. Posturographic assessment showed that patients with PD had significantly lower LOS area and balance functional reserve values, and greater body sway area in all posturographic conditions compared with healthy subjects.\nPatients with PD have reduced LOS area and greater postural sway compared with healthy subjects. The deterioration in postural control was significantly associated with major risk of falls.",

    "abstract": "Despite an increased understanding of the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), and a number of drugs designed to ameliorate symptoms, finding an effective neuroprotective therapy remains elusive. For decades now, several promising agents targeting different pathways have been explored as potential treatments that could help slow disease progression, but these have met with limited success. There are hurdles to overcome, particularly given that there is no exact animal model of PD and also no reliable biomarkers for PD. Without biomarkers, it is not possible to demonstrate, in the context of a clinical trial, that an intervention prevents neuronal degeneration. However, given the compelling scientific rationale of several compounds, an unrelenting pursuit continues. There have been hundreds of human studies looking at neuroprotection in PD. This article will briefly summarize several of the neuroprotective treatments that have been evaluated in large clinical trials, and will also outline some of the newer therapies that are currently being explored.",

    "abstract": "G-protein coupled dopamine and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu) can modulate neurotransmission during Parkinson's disease (PD)-like neurodegeneration. PET imaging studies in a unilateral dopamine denervation model (6-OHDA) showed a significant inverse correlation of presynaptic mGlu4 and postsynaptic mGlu5 expression in the striatum and rapidly declining mGlu4 and enhanced mGlu5 expression in the hippocampus during progressive degeneration over time. Immunohistochemical studies verified the decreased mGlu4 expression in the hippocampus on the lesion side but did not show difference in mGlu5 expression between lesion and control side. Pharmacological MRI studies showed enhanced hemodynamic response in several brain areas on the lesion side compared to the control side after challenge with mGlu4 positive allosteric modulator or mGlu5 negative allosteric modulator. However, mGlu4 response was biphasic having short enhancement followed by negative response on both sides of brain. Studies in mGlu4 expressing cells demonstrated that glutamate induces cooperative increase in binding of mGlu4 ligands - especially at high glutamate levels consistent with in\u00a0vivo concentration. This suggests that mGlu allosteric modulators as drug candidates will be highly sensitive to changes in glutamate concentration and hence metabolic state. These experiments demonstrate the importance of the longitudinal imaging studies to investigate temporal changes in receptor functions to obtain individual response for experimental drugs.",

However, the role of aging in the pathogenesis of PD is not known and it is currently uncertain why the symptoms take many decades to develop when inherited mutations that cause the disease can be present from birth. We hypothesize that there are specific changes that take place during the aging process that make cells susceptible to disease-causing mutations that are well-tolerated at younger ages. If so, then interventions that increase lifespan should be beneficial in the treatment of PD. To test this hypothesis, we used the powerful genetics of ",

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that besides freezing of gait (FOG), many people with Parkinson's disease (PD) also suffer from freezing in the upper limbs (FOUL). Up to now, it is unclear which task constraints provoke and explain upper limb freezing.\nTo investigate whether upper limb freezing and other kinematic abnormalities during writing are provoked by (i) gradual changes in amplitude or by (ii) sustained amplitude generation in patients with and without freezing of gait.\nThirty-four patients with PD, including 17 with and 17 without FOG, performed a writing task on a touch-sensitive writing tablet requiring writing at constant small and large size as well as writing at gradually increasing and decreasing size. Patients of both groups were matched for disease severity, tested while 'on' medication and compared to healthy age-matched controls.\nFifty upper limb freezing episodes were detected in 10 patients, including 8 with and 2 without FOG. The majority of the episodes occurred when participants had to write at small or gradually decreasing size. The occurrence of FOUL and the number of FOUL episodes per patient significantly correlated with the occurrence and severity of FOG. Patients with FOUL also showed a significantly smaller amplitude in the writing parts outside the freezing episodes.\nCorroborating findings of gait research, the current study supports a core problem in amplitude control underlying FOUL, both in maintaining as well as in flexibly adapting the cycle size.",

    "abstract": "The effects of the inflammatory mediators involved in systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) on subsequent Parkinson disease have been reported, but no relevant studies have focused on the association between the 2 diseases. This nationwide population-based study evaluated the risk of Parkinson disease in patients with SLE.We identified 12,817 patients in the Taiwan National Health Insurance database diagnosed with SLE between 2000 and 2010 and compared the incidence rate of Parkinson disease among these patients with that among 51,268 randomly selected age and sex-matched non-SLE patients. A Cox multivariable proportional-hazards model was used to evaluate the risk factors of Parkinson disease in the SLE cohort.We observed an inverse association between a diagnosis of SLE and the risk of subsequent Parkinson disease, with the crude hazard ratio (HR) being 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.45-0.79) and adjusted HR being 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.51-0.90). The cumulative incidence of Parkinson disease was 0.83% lower in the SLE cohort than in the non-SLE cohort. The adjusted HR of Parkinson disease decreased as the follow-up duration increased and was decreased among older lupus patients with comorbidity.We determined that patients with SLE had a decreased risk of subsequent Parkinson disease. Further research is required to elucidate the underlying mechanism.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the safety and assess the different symptom improvements found after a combined low-frequency primary motor cortex and high-frequency prefrontal cortex (PFC) stimulation using the deep TMS (dTMS) H-coil, as an add-on treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD).\nForty-five PD patients underwent 14 dTMS sessions; each consisting of 1\u2009Hz stimulation of the primary motor cortex for 15\u2009min, followed by 10\u2009Hz stimulation of the PFC for 15\u2009min. Clinical assessments were performed, BEFORE, at the MIDDLE, and END of therapy as well as at FOLLOW-UP after 30\u2009days, using Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, TINETTI, UP&GO, SCOPA, HDRS21, Beck Depression Inventory, and self-applied daily motor assessment scales.\nTreatment was well-tolerated, without serious adverse effects. dTMS-induced significant PD symptom improvements at END and at FOLLOW-UP, in all subscales of the UPDRS, gait speed, depressive symptoms, balance, autonomic symptoms, and a 73% increase in daily ON time.\nIn the cohort of PD patients treated, dTMS was well-tolerated with only minor adverse effects. The dTMS-induced significant improvements in motor, postural, and motivational symptoms of PD patients and may potentiate concurrent levodopa treatment.\nThe present study demonstrates that dTMS may have a much wider spectrum of beneficial effects than previously reported for TMS, including enhancement of levodopa effects, suggesting that future clinical trials with dTMS should include a broader range of symptom measurements.",

    "abstract": "Significantly lower BMD in PD compared to healthy subjects in both genders.Less than 35\u2009mg(2)/dl(2) of Ca-P product in >80% of PD patients.Significant correlations between BMD and severity of PD.Lower BMD at H&Y stage III/IV than that at H&Y stage I/II.\nAlthough several lines of evidence have suggested that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have a higher risk of osteoporosis and fracture, the association between bone mineral density (BMD) and severity of PD patients is unknown.\nWe performed a cross-sectional study of 54 patients with PD and 59 healthy age-matched controls. Multiple clinical scales were used to evaluate the severity of PD, and serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, and homocysteine were measured to determine BMD's association with PD severity.\nBMD in PD patients was significantly lower than that in healthy controls. The BMD scores of the spine, femoral neck (FN), and hip were lower in females than in males in the healthy group. In the PD group, BMD in the hip was significantly lower in females compared to males. There was a negative correlation between daily l-DOPA dosage and BMD in the spine and hip in the PD group, while BMD in the spine, neck, and hip was significantly correlated with severity of PD. Besides, we found that among the lumbar spine (LS), FN, and hip, bone loss in the LS was the most severe in PD patients based on the T-scores.\nOur findings support the hypothesis that patients with PD have a higher risk of osteoporosis, and that low BMD in the spine, FN, and hip may indirectly reflect the severity of PD. Our findings have prompted us to pay more attention to osteoporosis in the LS in Chinese PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Lithium, the long-standing hallmark treatment for bipolar disorder, has recently been identified as a potential neuroprotective agent in neurodegeneration. Here we focus on introducing numerous in vitro and in vivo studies that have shown lithium treatment to be efficacious in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, increasing autophagy, inhibiting apoptosis, and decreasing the accumulation of \u03b1-synulcein, with an emphasis on Parkinson's disease. A number of biological pathways have been shown to be involved in causing these neuroprotective effects. The inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2 has been the mechanism most studied; however, other modes of action include the regulation of apoptotic proteins and glutamate excitotoxicity as well as down-regulation of calpain. This review provides a framework of the neuroprotective effects of lithium in neurodegenerative diseases and the putative mechanisms by which lithium provides the protection. Lithium-only treatment may not be a suitable therapeutic option for neurodegenerative diseases due to inconsistent efficacy and potential side-effects, however, the use of low dose lithium in combination with other potential or existing therapeutic compounds may be a promising approach to reduce symptoms and disease progression in neurodegenerative diseases.",

In this study, the neuroprotective effects of water extract of TGY were tested on rotenone-intoxicated and human \u03b1-synuclein transgenic Drosophila PD models. In addition, the neuroprotective effect of TGY was also evaluated in the human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line treated with rotenone and the rotenone intoxicated hemi-parkinsonian rats. In rotenone-induced PD models, TGY improved survival rate, alleviated impaired locomotor function of Drosophila, mitigated the loss of dopaminergic neurons in hemi-parkinsonian rats and alleviated apoptotic cell death in SH-SY5Y cells; in \u03b1-synuclein transgenic Drosophila, TGY reduced the level of \u03b1-synuclein and prevented degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Conclusively, TGY is neuroprotective in PD models both in vivo and in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Autonomic and somatic denervation is well established in Parkinson's disease (PD).\n(1) To determine whether corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) can non-invasively demonstrate small nerve fiber damage in PD. (2) To identify relationships between corneal nerve parameters, intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) and clinical features of PD.\nTwenty-six PD patients and 26 controls underwent CCM of both eyes. 24/26 PD patients and 10/26 controls underwent skin biopsies from the dorsa of both feet. PD patients underwent assessment of parasympathetic function [deep breathing heart rate variability (DB-HRV)], autonomic symptoms [scale for outcomes in Parkinson's disease - autonomic symptoms (SCOPA-AUT)], motor symptoms [UPDRS-III \"ON\"] and cumulative Levodopa dose.\nPD patients had significantly reduced corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD) with increased corneal nerve branch density (CNBD) and corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL) compared to controls. CNBD and CNFL but not CNFD correlated inversely with UPDRS-III and SCOPA-AUT. All CCM parameters correlated strongly with DB-HRV. There was no correlation between CCM parameters and disease duration, cumulative Levodopa dose or pain. IENFD was significantly reduced in PD compared to controls and correlated with CNFD and UPDRS-III. However, unlike CCM measures, IENFD correlated with disease duration and cumulative Levodopa dose but not with autonomic dysfunction.\nCCM identifies corneal nerve fiber pathology, which correlates with autonomic symptoms, parasympathetic deficits and motor scores in patients with PD. IENFD is also reduced and correlates with CNFD and motor symptoms but not parasympathetic deficits, indicating it detects different aspects of peripheral nerve pathology in PD.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral autoregulation is a complex homeostatic process which ensures constant brain blood supply, despite continuous blood pressure fluctuations. Recent evidence suggests that in Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) this process is maintained in a broadened range of blood pressure values, consistent with an adaptive mechanism to increase tolerance to orthostatic hypotension. In PD and MSA orthostatic hypotension may be accompanied by supine hypertension which has been recently linked with cerebral white matter lesions in these conditions. We hypothesize that cerebral autoregulation adaptation to chronic orthostatic hypotension may be directly related with an increase susceptibility to hypertensive peaks. Evaluation of cerebral autoregulatory behavior may thus represent a novel approach to simultaneously target orthostatic symptoms and silent end-organ damage in alpha-synucleinopathies, with a beneficial impact on cerebrovascular and cognitive outcome.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease with vocal communication deficits that manifest early, progress, and are largely resistant to medical interventions; however, they do respond to exercise-based speech and voice therapies.\nTo study how exercise-based vocal treatment can affect the progression of communication deficits related to PD, we studied ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in rats with homozygous knockout (-/-) of PINK1, a gene mutation known to cause PD, under the manipulation of a behavioral vocal exercise paradigm that allows us to precisely control dose and timing of exercise in the prodromal (prior to diagnosis) stages.\nWe show that intensive vocal-training rescues frequency range and intensity deficits as well as leads to an increase in call complexity and duration of calls compared to sham-training; however, over time this training regime loses significant effect as the disease progresses. We also show effects of frequent handling and conspecific (male-female) interaction in the sham-training group as they demonstrated significantly higher call rate, intensity, frequency range, and call complexity compared to rats without any form of training and consequently less handling/interaction. Further, we confirm that this model exhibits progressive gross motor deficits that indicate neurodegeneration.\nThis study suggests that the evolving nature of vocal communication deficits requires an adjustment of therapy targets and more intensive training over the course of this progressive disease and demonstrates the importance of frequent social experiences.",

    "abstract": "Changes in episodic memory are common early in Parkinson's disease (PD) and may be a risk factor for future cognitive decline. Although medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory and frontostriatal (FS) executive systems are thought to play different roles in distinct components of episodic memory impairment in PD, no study has investigated whether different aspects of memory functioning are differentially associated with MTL and FS volumes in nondemented patients without mild cognitive impairment (PD-woMCI).\nThe present study investigated MRI markers of different facets of memory functioning in 48 PD-woMCI patients and 42 controls.\nRegional volumes were measured in structures comprising the MTL and FS systems and then correlated with key indices of memory from the California Verbal Learning Test.\nIn PD-woMCI patients, memory was impaired only for verbal learning, which was not associated with executive, attention/working memory, or visuospatial functioning. Despite an absence of cortical atrophy, smaller right MTL volumes in patients were associated with poorer verbal learning, long delayed free recall, long delayed cued recall, and recognition memory hits and false positives. Smaller right pars triangularis (inferior frontal) volumes were also associated with poorer long delayed cued recall and recognition memory hits. These relationships were not found in controls.\nThe findings indicate that MTL volumes are sensitive to subtle changes in almost all facets of memory in PD-woMCI, whereas FS volumes are sensitive only to memory performances in cued-testing formats.",

People diagnosed with HIV are living beyond the age of 50 but are experiencing the cumulative effects of HIV infection and aging on brain function. In HIV-infected aging individuals, the potential synergy between immunosenescence and HIV viral loads increases susceptibility to HIV-related brain injury and functional brain network degradation similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in the aging population. Although there are clear diagnostic differences in the primary pathology of both diseases, i.e., death of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra in PD and neuroinflammation in HIV, neurotoxicity to dopaminergic terminals in the basal ganglia (BG) has been implied in the pathogenesis of HIV and neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of PD. Similar to PD, HIV infection affects structures of the BG, which are part of interconnected circuits including mesocorticolimbic pathways linking brainstem nuclei to BG and cortices subserving attention, cognitive control, and motor functions. The present review discusses the combined effects of aging and neuroinflammation in HIV individuals on cognition and motor function in comparison with age-related neurodegenerative processes in PD. Despite the many challenges, some HIV patients manage to age successfully, most likely by redistribution of neural network resources to enhance function, as occurs in healthy elderly; such compensation could be curtailed by emerging PD.",

    "abstract": "This study describes how the application of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can be used to study motor function in humans with Parkinson's disease (PD) and in animal models of PD. Human data is obtained using commercially available sensors via a range of non-invasive procedures that follow conventional clinical practice. EAs can then be used to classify human data for a range of uses, including diagnosis and disease monitoring. New results are presented that demonstrate how EAs can also be used to classify fruit flies with and without genetic mutations that cause Parkinson's by using measurements of the proboscis extension reflex. The case is made for a computational approach that can be applied across human and animal studies of PD and lays the way for evaluation of existing and new drug therapies in a truly objective way.",

    "abstract": "Mortality rate, life expectancy, survival, and the impact of comorbidities on them in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) need to be assessed in settings with different sociodemographic backgrounds. We investigated mortality features in Iranian PD patients focusing on the role of cardiovascular multimorbidity on their survival. Data on mortality and comorbidity profile was gathered in a cohort of 190 individuals with idiopathic PD referred to a Movement Disorders Clinic. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) compared to the Tehran general population was 3.44 and the life expectancy at birth was 67.4 (95% CI: 59.1-75.8)\u2009yr. Patients with at least one cardiovascular comorbidity had a shorter survival time after PD onset (14.0 versus 29.2\u2009yr, p = 0.012). The hazard ratio for death increased 2.8 times (95% CI: 1.5-5.2, p = 0.002) with one additional cardiovascular comorbidity. Among all comorbid conditions, stroke showed the strongest independent effect on mortality in PD patients [HR = 13.1 (95% CI: 2.4-71.7), p = 0.003]. Conclusively, life expectancy was slightly lower in Iranian PD patients compared to the general population, while the SMR was high. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity substantially decreased survival in people with PD. Our study highlights the need for assessment, prevention, and treatment of cardiovascular morbidities in parkinsonian patients, given their effect on survival.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. This open-label study assessed the efficacy and safety of exclusive night-time administration of transdermal rotigotine in patients with nocturnal and early morning PD symptoms. Methods. Patients with PD and nocturnal and early morning symptoms received transdermal rotigotine patches (2-16\u2009mg/24\u2009h) applied in the evening and removed in the morning for 3 months. Sleep disturbance was assessed with modified Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS-2). Other outcomes included a pain visual analogue scale (VAS) and short-form Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8) for quality of life. Results. 74 patients completed treatment in this study. At the end of treatment, PDSS-2 total score had improved by mean 10.9 points from baseline (p < 0.001). All three PDSS-2 domain scores (sleep disturbances, nocturnal motor symptoms, and nocturnal symptoms) were also significantly improved by 41%, 56%, and 48%, respectively (p < 0.001). VAS-pain score decreased from 3.2 to 2.3 (p < 0.001). PDQ-8 score decreased from 23.8 to 18.1 (p < 0.001). The most frequently reported adverse events included nausea (9%), anxiety (4%), and dizziness (4%). Conclusions. Night-time administration of transdermal rotigotine is an effective and well tolerated treatment for nocturnal symptoms in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a chronic, debilitating neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta region in human midbrain. To date, oxidative stress is the well accepted concept in the etiology and progression of Parkinson's disease. Hence, the therapeutic agent is targeted against suppressing and alleviating the oxidative stress-induced cellular damage. Within the past decades, an explosion of research discoveries has reported on the protective mechanisms of flavonoids, which are plant-based polyphenols, in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease using both in vitro and in vivo models. In this paper, we have reviewed the literature on the neuroprotective mechanisms of flavonoids in protecting the dopaminergic neurons hence reducing the symptoms of this movement disorder. The mechanism reviewed includes effect of flavonoids in activation of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, suppressing the lipid peroxidation, inhibition of inflammatory mediators, flavonoids as a mitochondrial target therapy, and modulation of gene expression in neuronal cells.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that recognize their protein-coding target genes and whereby subjugate them after transcription. Despite the infancy of this field of science, the role of miRNAs in neurodegeneration is well-acknowledged. This review was conducted to indicate that Parkinson's disease (PD) is not excluded from this rule. To this end, we evaluated the existing literature and arranged PD-associated miRNAs according to their mechanism of action, particularly apoptosis, autophagy, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. According to this arrangement, a majority of PD-associated miRNAs were indicated to influence autophagic/apoptotic pathways. We also categorized PD-associated miRNAs according to that they could exert detrimental or beneficial or both into three sets, activator, inhibitor, and double-edged, correspondingly. Considering this criterion, a majority of PD-associated miRNAs were included in the activator category. In addition, evidences from genetic association studies investigating genetic variants of or related to miRNAs in PD patients are presented. Finally, possible applications of the miRNA machinery in PD, including mechanistic networks, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potentials, are discussed. But there may be additional miRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of PD which have hitherto remained unknown and thus further studies are needed to explore the issue and to extend this platform.",

    "abstract": "A novel empirical mode decomposition method was adopted to investigate the dissociative or interactive neural impact of depression and motor impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD). Resting-state fMRI data of 59 PD subjects were first decomposed into characteristic frequency bands, and the main effects of motor severity and depression and their interaction on the energy of blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal oscillation in specific frequency bands were then evaluated. The results show that the severity of motor symptoms is negatively correlated with the energy in the frequency band of 0.10-0.25\u2009Hz in the bilateral thalamus, but positively correlated with 0.01-0.027\u2009Hz band energy in the bilateral postcentral gyrus. The severity of depression, on the other hand, is positively correlated with the energy of 0.10-0.25\u2009Hz but negatively with 0.01-0.027\u2009Hz in the bilateral subgenual gyrus. Notably, the interaction between motor and depressive symptoms is negatively correlated with the energy of 0.10-0.25\u2009Hz in the substantia nigra, hippocampus, inferior orbitofrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction, but positively correlated with 0.02-0.05\u2009Hz in the same regions. These findings indicate unique associations of fMRI band signals with motor and depressive symptoms in PD in specific brain regions, which may underscore the neural impact of the comorbidity and the differentiation between the two PD-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a frequent and complex progressive neurological disorder that increases in incidence with age. Although historically PD has been characterized by the presence of progressive dopaminergic neuronal loss of the substantia nigra, the disease process also involves neurotransmitters other that dopamine and regions of the nervous system outside the basal ganglia. Its clinical presentation in elderly subjects differs from that in younger subjects, with more rapid progression, less frequent tremor, more pronounced axial signs, more frequent non-motor signs linked to concomitant degeneration of non-dopaminergic systems, and more frequent associated lesions. Despite the high prevalence of PD in elderly subjects, few therapeutic trials have been conducted in geriatric patients. Nevertheless, to improve functional disability while ensuring drug tolerance, the principles of optimized and multidisciplinary clinical management have to be known. The aim of this review is to provide an update on clinical and therapeutic features of PD specifically observed in elderly subjects.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence points to a neuroprotective action of bee venom on nigral dopamine neurons in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we examined whether bee venom also displays a symptomatic action by acting on the pathological functioning of the basal ganglia in rat PD models. Bee venom effects were assessed by combining motor behavior analyses and in vivo electrophysiological recordings in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr, basal ganglia output structure) in pharmacological (neuroleptic treatment) and lesional (unilateral intranigral 6-hydroxydopamine injection) PD models. In the hemi-parkinsonian 6-hydroxydopamine lesion model, subchronic bee venom treatment significantly alleviates contralateral forelimb akinesia and apomorphine-induced rotations. Moreover, a single injection of bee venom reverses haloperidol-induced catalepsy, a pharmacological model reminiscent of parkinsonian akinetic deficit. This effect is mimicked by apamin, a blocker of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels, and blocked by CyPPA, a positive modulator of these channels, suggesting the involvement of SK channels in the bee venom antiparkinsonian action. In vivo electrophysiological recordings in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (basal ganglia output structure) showed no significant effect of BV on the mean neuronal discharge frequency or pathological bursting activity. In contrast, analyses of the neuronal responses evoked by motor cortex stimulation show that bee venom reverses the 6-OHDA- and neuroleptic-induced biases in the influence exerted by the direct inhibitory and indirect excitatory striatonigral circuits. These data provide the first evidence for a beneficial action of bee venom on the pathological functioning of the cortico-basal ganglia circuits underlying motor PD symptoms with potential relevance to the symptomatic treatment of this disease.",

    "abstract": "While immune control is associated with nigrostriatal neuroprotection for Parkinson's disease, direct cause and effect relationships have not yet been realized, and modulating the immune system for therapeutic gain has been openly debated. Here, we review how innate and adaptive immunity affect disease pathobiology, and how each could be harnessed for treatment. The overarching idea is to employ immunopharmacologics as neuroprotective strategies for disease. The aim of the current work is to review disease-modifying treatments that are currently being developed as neuroprotective strategies for PD in experimental animal models and for human disease translation. The long-term goal of this research is to effectively harness the immune system to slow or prevent PD pathobiology.",

    "abstract": "Pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) cholinergic neurons, which exert excitatory nicotinic control over substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, degenerate in Parkinson's disease (PD). This finding and other studies showing that nicotine, the preferential agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, is neuroprotective in experimental models of PD suggest that a deficit in PPN excitatory cholinergic inputs might contribute to the death of nigral dopaminergic neurons in PD. To explore this possibility, we used lesion paradigms of dopaminergic and/or cholinergic systems in rats and monkeys. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed that stereotaxic lesioning of PPN cholinergic neurons with diphtheria toxin coupled to urotensin II resulted in a significant loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons in rats and induced morphological changes in these neurons in macaques. Unexpectedly, a lesion of dopaminergic neurons induced by unilateral striatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in rats, or by repeated systemic injections of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in macaques, led to a 29% and 7% loss of PPN cholinergic neurons, respectively. Lastly, when the PPN cholinergic lesion was performed in rats in which the dopaminergic lesion induced by 6-OHDA was in progress, loss of cholinergic neurons was more drastic than when each neurotransmitter system was lesioned separately. Thus, our results suggest that strong PPN cholinergic and dopaminergic interactions may be an important mechanism in the pathophysiology of PD.",

    "abstract": "The factors affecting the correlation between Parkinson disease (PD) and depression have remained unclear.\nWe assessed the prevalence of depression among patients with PD and the association between PD-related variables and depression severity.\nThis is a cross-sectional study performed in Kermanshah Province of Iran. Sampling was based on recruitment of subjects according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients with confirmed Parkinson disease who were referred to clinics of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences participated in this study. Depression was evaluated with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Clinical characteristics of PD, including tremor, rigidity, impaired posture, loss of autonomic movement, changes in speech and handwriting, masked face, and hyposmia were indexed. Anhedonia was assessed with Farsi version of Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale. Data were collected between April 2010 and March 2014.\nA total of 350 patients (52.9% men and 47.1% women) participated in this investigation. Female gender (36.5% in women vs. 13.0% in men, P < 0.0001), impaired posture (27.2% in affected individuals vs. 18.8%, P = 0.002), masked face (39.0% vs. 5.2%, P < 0.0001), and hyposmia (48.7% vs. 21.0%, P = 0.001) were associated with higher susceptibility to profound depression. Lower scores of all domains of Farsi version of Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (including interest/pastimes, social interaction, sensory experience, and food/drink) were related to more severe depression (P < 0.0001 for all subscales). Severe and profound depression was found in 44% of the participants.\nThis study estimated that the prevalence of major depression among Iranian individuals with PD living in Kermanshah as 44%. Major determinants of depression were female gender, rigidity, impaired posture, masked face, hyposmia, and anhedonia.",

    "abstract": "The most popular surgical method for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is simultaneous bilateral DBS. However, some centers conduct a staged unilateral approach advocating that reduced continuous intraoperative time reduces postoperative complications, thus justifying the cost of a second operative session. To test these assumptions, we performed a retrospective analysis of the Truven Health MarketScan\u00ae Database.\nUsing the MarketScan Database, we retrospectively analyzed patients that underwent simultaneous bilateral or staged unilateral DBS between 2000 and 2009. The main outcome measures were 90-day postoperative complication rates, number of reprogramming hours one year following procedure, and annualized healthcare cost. The outcome measures were compared between cohorts using multivariate regressions controlling for appropriate covariates.\nA total of 713 patients that underwent DBS between 2000 and 2009 met inclusion criteria for the study. Of these patients, 556 underwent simultaneous bilateral DBS and 157 received staged unilateral DBS. No statistically significant differences were found between groups in the rate of infection (simultaneous: 4.3% vs. staged: 7.0%; p = 0.178), pneumonia (3.1% vs. 5.7%; p = 0.283), hemorrhage (2.9% vs. 2.5%; p = 0.844), pulmonary embolism (0.5% vs. 1.3%), and device-related complications (0.5% vs. 0.0%). Patients in the staged cohort had a higher rate of lead revision in 90 days (3.2% vs. 12.7%; RR = 3.07; p < 0.001). The staged cohort had a higher mean (SD) number of reprogramming hours within one year of procedure (6.0 \u00b1 5.7 vs. 7.8 \u00b1 8.1; RR = 1.17; p < 0.001). No significant difference was found between the mean (SD) annualized payments between the cohorts ($86,100 \u00b1 $94,700 vs. $102,100 \u00b1 $121,500; p = 0.148).\nOur study did not find a significant difference between 90-day postoperative complication rates or annualized cost between the staged and simultaneous cohorts. Thus, we believe that it is important to consider other factors when deciding between the staged and simultaneous DBS. Such factors include patient convenience and the laterality of symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The differential diagnosis between multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) and Parkinson's disease (PD) may be challenging at disease onset. Levodopa responsiveness helps distinguish the two groups, but studies evaluating this issue using objective standardized tests are scanty. We retrospectively examined the extent of levodopa response by an objective kinetic-dynamic test in a series of patients prospectively followed up for a parkinsonian syndrome and eventually diagnosed as MSA-P or PD. Sixteen MSA-P and 31 PD patients under chronic levodopa therapy received a first morning fasting dose of levodopa/benserazide (100/25 mg) or levodopa/carbidopa (125/12.5 or 100/25 mg) and underwent simultaneous serial assessments of plasma levodopa concentration and alternate finger tapping frequency up to 3 h post dosing. The main levodopa pharmacodynamic variables were the maximum percentage increase in tapping frequency over baseline values (\u0394Tapmax %) and the area under the tapping effect-time curve (AUCTap). Levodopa pharmacokinetics did not show significant differences between MSA-P and PD, whereas both the magnitude and overall extent of levodopa tapping effect were markedly reduced in the MSA-P group (p < 0.001). The combined use of specific cut-off values for both the main pharmacodynamic variables, \u0394Tapmax % <20% and AUCTap <1900 [(tapping/min)\u00b7min], correctly discriminated 15 out of 16 MSA-P patients from PD patients. A combined estimation of these pharmacodynamic variables after a subacute low levodopa dose may be a simple and practical clinical tool to aid the differential diagnosis between MSA-P and PD.",

    "abstract": "The authors report the cumulative incidence of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) over a 3 years follow-up period in 92 de novo Parkinson's disease patients under chronic dopaminergic therapy and the clinical course of the sensory-motor disorder over 12 months as from its onset. The overall cumulative incidence of RLS was found by 15.3%, i.e. 14 incident cases, and by 11.9%, i.e. 11 incident cases, after the exclusion of possible \"secondary\" forms of the disorder. These figures are higher than those reported in general population in Germany (Study of Health in Pomerania), confirming our previous findings of incidence rate of the disorder. At the end of the 3 years follow-up period the prevalence of \"current\" RLS was significantly higher than that previously found in drug na\u00efve Parkinson's disease patients and in controls, supporting the view that RLS emerging in the course of chronic dopaminergic therapy is the main determinant of the co-morbid association with Parkinson's disease. During the 12 months period of observation the RLS showed a frequency of occurrence of 6.08 episodes per month on average and a remittent clinical course was prevailing in the 11 incident cases, with a significant frequency decrease in the second as compared to the first 6 months, i.e. 3.26 versus 8.9 episodes per month, and none of the patients developed augmentation in the same period. It is hypothesized that the remittent course could be due to long-term adaptation (downregulation) of the hypersensitive post-synaptic dopamine receptors in the spinal cord to a continuous dopaminergic stimulation, possibly coupled with compensatory up-regulation of pre-synaptic dopamine re-uptake mechanism, in the patients in which the hypothalamic A11 area, site of origin of the dopamine-mediated diencephalo-spinal pathway, is involved in the neurodegenerative process.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by changes to dopaminergic function in the striatum and a range of cognitive and motor deficits. Neuroimaging studies have repeatedly shown differences in activation and functional connectivity patterns of the striatum between symptomatic individuals with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls. However, the presence and severity of cognitive and motor symptoms seem to differ dramatically among individuals with Parkinson's disease at the early-stages. To investigate the neural basis of such heterogeneity, we examined the resting state functional connectivity patterns of caudate and putamen subdivisions in relation to cognitive and motor impairments among 62 early-stage individuals with Parkinson's disease (21 females, 23 drug naive, ages 39-77 years, average UPDRS motor scores off medication\u2009=\u200918.56, average H&Y stage\u2009=\u20091.66). We also explored how changes in striatal connectivity relate to changes in symptomatology over a year. There are two main findings. First, higher motor deficit rating was associated with weaker coupling between anterior putamen and midbrain including substantia nigra. Intriguingly, steeper declines in functional connectivity between these regions were associated with greater declines in motor function over the course of 1 year. Second, decline in cognitive function, particularly in the memory and visuospatial domains, was associated with stronger coupling between the dorsal caudate and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. These findings remained significant after controlling for age, medication, gender, and education. In sum, our findings suggest that cognitive decline and motor deficit are each associated with a differentiable pattern of functional connectivity of striatal subregions.

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) continues to be a major challenge in the field. The lack of a robust biomarker to detect early stage PD patients has considerably slowed the progress toward the development of potential therapeutic agents. We have previously evaluated several RNA biomarkers in whole blood from participants enrolled in two independent clinical studies. In these studies, PD patients were medicated, thus, expression of these biomarkers in de novo patients remains unknown. To this end, we tested ten RNA biomarkers in blood samples from 99 untreated PD patients and 101 HC nested in the cross-sectional Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative by quantitative real-time PCR. One biomarker out of ten, COPZ1 trended toward significance (nominal p = 0.009) when adjusting for age, sex, and educational level. Further, COPZ1, EFTUD2 and PTBP1 mRNAs correlated with clinical features in PD patients including the Hoehn and Yahr scale, Movement Disorder Society revision of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. Levels of EFTUD2 and PTBP1 were significantly higher in cognitively normal PD patients (PD-CN) compared to cognitively impaired PD patients (PD-MCI). Interestingly, blood glucose levels were significantly higher in PD and PD-MCI patients (\u2265 100 mg/dL, pre-diabetes) compared to HC. Collectively, we report the association of three RNA biomarkers, COPZ1, EFTUD2 and PTBP1 with clinical features including cognitive decline in early drug-na\u00efve PD patients. Further, our results show that drug-na\u00efve PD and PD-MCI patients have glucose levels characteristic of pre-diabetes patients, suggesting that impaired glucose metabolism is an early event in PD. Evaluation of these potential biomarkers in a larger longitudinal study is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Microglia activation and inflammatory factors in brain microenvironment are associated with degeneration of neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and various PD models. There is increasing evidence that the Rho/ROCK (Rho kinase) signalling pathway may play a critical role in the inflammatory response, and ROCK inhibitor has been reported to have neuroprotective effects. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective potential and possible mechanism of ROCK inhibitor Fasudil in an intranasal lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PD model. ROCK was activated with LPS stimulation and inhibited by Fasudil treatment in this PD model. Behavioural tests demonstrated a clear improvement in motor performance after Fasudil treatment. Furthermore, Fasudil resulted in a significant attenuation of dopamine cell loss, \u03b1-synuclein accumulation and inflammatory response with the reversion of inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 microglia, decreased NF-\u043aB activation, and IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 generation in the SN and olfactory bulb in this model. This study establishes a role for Fasudil in protecting against LPS-mediated dopamine degeneration and provides a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "We recently developed a novel PET probe, 6-(11)C-methyl-m-tyrosine ((11)C-6MemTyr), for quantitative imaging of presynaptic dopamine synthesis in the living brain. In the present study, (11)C-6MemTyr was compared with \u03b2-(11)C-l-DOPA and 6-(18)F-fluoro-l-dopa ((18)F-FDOPA) in the brains of normal and Parkinson disease (PD) model monkeys (Macaca fascicularis).\nPD model monkeys were prepared by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) administration, and (11)C-\u03b2-CFT was applied to assess neuronal damage as dopamine transporter (DAT) availability. (11)C-6MemTyr, \u03b2-(11)C-l-DOPA, or (18)F-FDOPA was injected with and without carbidopa, a specific inhibitor of peripheral aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. In normal and PD monkeys, the dopamine synthesis rates calculated using PET probes were analyzed by the correlation plot with DAT availability in the striatum.\nIn normal monkeys, whole-brain uptake of \u03b2-(11)C-l-DOPA and (18)F-FDOPA were significantly increased by carbidopa at the clinical dose of 5 mg/kg by mouth. In contrast, (11)C-6MemTyr was not affected by carbidopa at this dose, and the metabolic constant value of (11)C-6MemTyr in the striatum was significantly higher than those of the other 2 PET probes. Significant reduction of the presynaptic DAT availability in the striatum was detected in MPTP monkeys, and correlation analyses demonstrated that (11)C-6MemTyr could detect dopaminergic damage in the striatum with much more sensitivity than the other PET probes.\n(11)C-6MemTyr is a potential PET probe for quantitative imaging of presynaptic dopamine activity in the living brain with PET.",

    "abstract": "Midbrain dopamine (DA) modulates the activity of basal ganglia circuitry important for motor control in a variety of species. In songbirds, DA underlies motivational behavior including reproductive drive and is implicated as a gatekeeper for neural activity governing vocal variability. In the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, DA levels increase in Area X, a song-dedicated subregion of the basal ganglia, when a male bird sings his courtship song to a female (female-directed; FD). Levels remain stable when he sings a less stereotyped version that is not directed toward a conspecific (undirected; UD). Here, we used a mild dose of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to reduce presynaptic DA input to Area X and characterized the effects on FD and UD behaviors. Immunoblots were used to quantify levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as a biomarker for DA afferent loss in vehicle- and 6-OHDA-injected birds. Following 6-OHDA administration, TH signals were lower in Area X but not in an adjacent subregion, ventral striatal-pallidum (VSP). A postsynaptic marker of DA signaling was unchanged in both regions. These observations suggest that effects were specific to presynaptic afferents of vocal basal ganglia. Concurrently, vocal variability was reduced during UD but not FD song. Similar decreases in vocal variability are observed in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), but the link to DA loss is not well-understood. The 6-OHDA songbird model offers a unique opportunity to further examine how DA loss in cortico-basal ganglia pathways affects vocal control.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of a specific protein in aggregated form is a common phenomenon in human neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson's disease, this protein is \u03b1-synuclein which is a neuronal protein of 143 amino acids. With a monomeric conformation in solution, it also has a natural capacity to aggregate into amyloid structures (dimers, oligomers, fibrils and Lewy bodies or neurites). It therefore fulfils the characteristics of a prion protein (different conformations, seeding and spreading). In vitro and in vivo experimental evidence in transgenic and wild animals indicates a prion-like propagation of Parkinson's disease. The sequential and predictive distribution of \u03b1-synuclein demonstrated by Braak et al. and its correlation with non-motor signs are consistent with the prion-like progression. Although the triggering factor causing the misfolding and aggregation of the target protein is unknown, Parkinson's disease is a highly relevant model for the study of these mechanisms and also to test specific treatments targeting the assemblies of \u03b1-synuclein and propagation from pre-motor phase of the disease. Despite this prion-like progression, there is currently no argument indicating a risk of human transmission of Parkinson's disease.\nL\u2019accumulation d\u2019une prot\u00e9ine sp\u00e9cifique sous forme agr\u00e9g\u00e9e est un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne commun aux maladies neurod\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ratives humaines. Dans la maladie de Parkinson, cette prot\u00e9ine est l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine qui est une prot\u00e9ine neuronale de 143\u00a0acides amin\u00e9s.

    "abstract": "Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, the rate limiting-enzyme in catecholamine synthesis) is regulated acutely via phosphorylation of 3 serine residues--Ser19, 31 and 40, and chronically via changes in TH protein levels. In this study, we aimed to investigate how TH is regulated in the brain, gut and adrenal gland as well as changes in mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF) and proBDNF levels in a low-dose (2 mg/kg, 5 days/week for 4 weeks) rotenone model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Rearing behaviour decreased by week 3 in the rotenone group (p<0.01), with further decreases in rearing by week 4 (p<0.001); however, TH remained unchanged in the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum; TH levels were also unaltered in other catecholaminergic cell groups of the brainstem such as A1C1 neurons or locus coeruleus. In the olfactory bulb, TH protein decreased (2.5-fold, p<0.01) while Ser31 phosphorylation increased (1.4-fold, p<0.05) in the rotenone group. In contrast, TH protein was increased in the adrenal gland (2-fold, p<0.05) and colon (5-fold, p<0.05) of rotenone rats. mBDNF levels were not changed in the SN but were significantly reduced in plasma and significantly increased in the colon (2-fold, p<0.01) of rotenone-treated rats. This is the first study to assess TH and BDNF in the brain and periphery in the rotenone model before SN/striatum degeneration is evident. Together these results suggest that low-dose rotenone may have some potential to model the early stages of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients show theory of mind (ToM) deficit since the early stages of the disease, and this deficit has been associated with working memory, executive functions and quality of life impairment. To date, neuroanatomical correlates of ToM have not been assessed with magnetic resonance imaging in PD. The main objective of this study was to assess cerebral correlates of ToM deficit in PD. The second objective was to explore the relationships between ToM, working memory and executive functions, and to analyse the neural correlates of ToM, controlling for both working memory and executive functions.\nThirty-seven PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr median = 2.0) and 15 healthy controls underwent a neuropsychological assessment and magnetic resonance images in a 3T-scanner were acquired. T1-weighted images were analysed with voxel-based morphometry, and white matter integrity and diffusivity measures were obtained from diffusion weighted images and analysed using tract-based spatial statistics.\nPD patients showed impairments in ToM, working memory and executive functions; grey matter loss and white matter reduction compared to healthy controls. Grey matter volume decrease in the precentral and postcentral gyrus, middle and inferior frontal gyrus correlated with ToM deficit in PD. White matter in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (adjacent to the parietal lobe) and white matter adjacent to the frontal lobe correlated with ToM impairment in PD. After controlling for executive functions, the relationship between ToM deficit and white matter remained significant for white matter areas adjacent to the precuneus and the parietal lobe.\nFindings reinforce the existence of ToM impairment from the early Hoehn and Yahr stages in PD, and the findings suggest associations with white matter and grey matter volume decrease. This study contributes to better understand ToM deficit and its neural correlates in PD, which is a basic skill for development of healthy social relationships.",

    "abstract": "The young-onset subtype of Parkinson's disease (YOPD) differs from the late-onset subtype (LOPD) in drug responsiveness, incidence of motor complications, and prognosis. The pathophysiology underlying these differences remains largely unknown. This study investigated whether the two subtypes differ in the pattern of dysfunction in striatal (caudate and putamen) dopaminergic system and if the dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging patterns are associated with the clinical features of corresponding PD subtype.\nWe assessed the spatial pattern of striatal dopaminergic dysfunction in 40 YOPD and 47 LOPD with early to mid-stage PD with DAT imaging by positron emission tomography. Two sub-regional parameters (caudate/putamen ratio and asymmetry index) were calculated to measure the spatial pattern of striatal dopaminergic dysfunction.\nThe caudate/anterior putamen ratios were significantly higher in YOPD than that in the LOPD (P = 0.03 contralateral to the most affected side of the body and P = 0.004 ipsilateral), which was supported by significantly inverse correlations between age of onset and caudate/anterior putamen ratios (r = -0.428, P < 0.001 for the contralateral and r = -0.576, P < 0.001 for the ipsilateral). Sub-regional DAT binding in caudate ipsilateral to affected limbs was significantly correlated with age, while DAT bindings in putamen were significantly inversely correlated with disease duration and UPDRS motor scores.\nThe YOPD subtype suffers from an uneven pattern of dopaminergic dysfunction: more sparing of the caudate compared with the putamen, while the LOPD patients is with a relatively uniform pattern.",

    "abstract": "We describe an interdisciplinary comparison of the effects of acute and chronic alcohol exposure in terms of their disturbance of light, dark and color preferences and the occurrence of Parkinson-like behavior in zebrafish through computer visual tracking, data mining, and behavioral and physiological analyses. We found that zebrafish in anxiolytic and anxious states, which are induced by acute and chronic repeated alcohol exposure, respectively, display distinct emotional reactions in light/dark preference tests as well as distinct learning and memory abilities in color-enhanced conditional place preference (CPP) tests. Additionally, compared with the chronic alcohol (1.0%) treatment, acute alcohol exposure had a significant, dose-dependent effect on anxiety, learning and memory (color preference) as well as locomotive activities. Acute exposure doses (0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5%) generated an \"inverted V\" dose-dependent pattern in all of the behavioral parameters, with 1.0% having the greatest effect, while the chronic treatment had a moderate effect. Furthermore, by measuring locomotive activity, learning and memory performance, the number of dopaminergic neurons, tyrosine hydroxylase expression, and the change in the photoreceptors in the retina, we found that acute and chronic alcohol exposure induced varying degrees of Parkinson-like symptoms in zebrafish. Taken together, these results illuminated the behavioral and physiological mechanisms underlying the changes associated with learning and memory and the cause of potential Parkinson-like behaviors in zebrafish due to acute and chronic alcohol exposure.",

    "abstract": "The striatum is essential for many aspects of mammalian behavior, including motivation and movement, and is dysfunctional in motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3) is expressed by striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) and is thus well positioned to regulate dopamine (DA) signaling and locomotor activity, a canonical measure of basal ganglia output. We now report that VGLUT3 knock-out (KO) mice show circadian-dependent hyperlocomotor activity that is restricted to the waking cycle and is due to an increase in striatal DA synthesis, packaging, and release. Using a conditional VGLUT3 KO mouse, we show that deletion of the transporter from CINs, surprisingly, does not alter evoked DA release in the dorsal striatum or baseline locomotor activity. The mice do, however, display changes in rearing behavior and sensorimotor gating. Elevation of DA release in the global KO raised the possibility that motor deficits in a Parkinson's disease model would be reduced. Remarkably, after a partial 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-mediated DA depletion (\u223c70% in dorsal striatum), KO mice, in contrast to WT mice, showed normal motor behavior across the entire circadian cycle. l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine-mediated dyskinesias were also significantly attenuated. These findings thus point to new mechanisms to regulate basal ganglia function and potentially treat Parkinson's disease and related disorders.\nDopaminergic signaling is critical for both motor and cognitive functions in the mammalian nervous system. Impairments, such as those found in Parkinson's disease patients, can lead to severe motor deficits. Vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3) loads glutamate into secretory vesicles for neurotransmission and is expressed by discrete neuron populations throughout the nervous system. Here, we report that the absence of VGLUT3 in mice leads to an upregulation of the midbrain dopamine system. Remarkably, in a Parkinson's disease model, the mice show normal motor behavior. They also show fewer abnormal motor behaviors (dyskinesias) in response to l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, the principal treatment for Parkinson's disease. The work thus suggests new avenues for the development of novel treatment strategies for Parkinson's disease and potentially other basal-ganglia-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to environmental chemicals has been implicated as a possible risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Our previous study showed that methylmercury (MeHg) exposure can disrupt synthesis, uptake and metabolism of dopamine similar to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)). The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of MeHg exposure on gene and protein profiles in a dopaminergic MN9D cell line. MN9D cells were treated with MeHg (1-5 \u03bcM) and MPP(+) (10-40 \u03bcM) for 48 hr. Real-time PCR Parkinson's disease (PD) arrays and high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) were performed for the analysis. PD PCR array results showed that 19% genes were significantly changed in the 2.5 \u03bcM MeHg treated cells, and 39% genes were changed in the 5 \u03bcM MeHg treated cells. In comparison, MPP(+) treatment (40 \u00b5M) resulted in significant changes in 25% genes. A total of 15 common genes were altered by both MeHg and MPP(+), and dopaminergic signaling transduction was the most affected pathway. Proteomic analysis identified a total of 2496 proteins, of which 188, 233 and 395 proteins were differentially changed by 1 \u03bcM and 2.5 \u03bcM MeHg, and MPP(+) respectively. A total of 61 common proteins were changed by both MeHg and MPP(+) treatment. The changed proteins were mainly involved in energetic generation-related metabolism pathway (propanoate metabolism, pyruvate metabolism and fatty acid metabolism), oxidative phosphorylation, proteasome, PD and other neurodegenerative disorders. A total of 7 genes/proteins including Ube2l3 (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 L3) and Th (Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase) were changed in both genomic and proteomic analysis. These results suggest that MeHg and MPP(+) share many similar signaling pathways leading to the pathogenesis of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Purpose. To investigate the impact of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) and levodopa intake on vowel articulation in dysarthric speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods. Vowel articulation was assessed in seven Quebec French speakers diagnosed with idiopathic PD who underwent STN DBS. Assessments were conducted on- and off-medication, first prior to surgery and then 1 year later. All recordings were made on-stimulation. Vowel articulation was measured using acoustic vowel space and formant centralization ratio. Results. Compared to the period before surgery, vowel articulation was reduced after surgery when patients were off-medication, while it was better on-medication. The impact of levodopa intake on vowel articulation changed with STN DBS: before surgery, levodopa impaired articulation, while it no longer had a negative effect after surgery. Conclusions. These results indicate that while STN DBS could lead to a direct deterioration in articulation, it may indirectly improve it by reducing the levodopa dose required to manage motor symptoms. These findings suggest that, with respect to speech production, STN DBS and levodopa intake cannot be investigated separately because the two are intrinsically linked. Along with motor symptoms, speech production should be considered when optimizing therapeutic management of patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive constituent of Cannabis sativa with potential to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Its neuroprotection has been mainly associated with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant events; however, other mechanisms might be involved. We investigated the involvement of neuritogenesis, NGF receptors (trkA), NGF, and neuronal proteins in the mechanism of neuroprotection of CBD against MPP(+) toxicity in PC12 cells. CBD increased cell viability, differentiation, and the expression of axonal (GAP-43) and synaptic (synaptophysin and synapsin I) proteins. Its neuritogenic effect was not dependent or additive to NGF, but it was inhibited by K252a (trkA inhibitor). CBD did not increase the expression of NGF, but protected against its decrease induced by MPP(+), probably by an indirect mechanism. We also evaluated the neuritogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells, which do not express trkA receptors. CBD did not induce neuritogenesis in this cellular model, which supports the involvement of trkA receptors. This is the first study to report the involvement of neuronal proteins and trkA in the neuroprotection of CBD. Our findings suggest that CBD has a neurorestorative potential independent of NGF that might contribute to its neuroprotection against MPP(+), a neurotoxin relevant to Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its canonical receptor Ret can signal together or independently to fulfill many important functions in the midbrain dopaminergic (DA) system. While Ret signaling clearly impacts on the development, maintenance and regeneration of the mesostriatal DA system, the physiological functions of GDNF for the DA system are still unclear. Nevertheless, GDNF is still considered to be an excellent candidate to protect and/or regenerate the mesostriatal DA system in Parkinson disease (PD). Clinical trials with GDNF on PD patients are, however, so far inconclusive. Here, we review the current knowledge of GDNF and Ret signaling and function in the midbrain DA system, and their crosstalk with proteins and signaling pathways associated with PD.",
