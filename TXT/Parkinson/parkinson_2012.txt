    "abstract": "Rasagiline is a monoamine oxidase type-B inhibitor used as monotherapy or in addition to levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Once daily administration of rasagiline makes it easy to use, and allows good compliance by patients and adherence to therapy. Several multicenter studies have noted the effectiveness of rasagiline on both motor and non-motor symptoms, which require a complex pharmacologic approach, such as cognitive disorders. A recent study also reported a rapid action of rasagiline on motor symptoms. Positive findings have been highlighted by an economic model study. This review analyzes the main studies of rasagiline, with particular attention to the effectiveness of the drug on motor symptoms.",

However, different psychiatric and cognitive problems may occur after DBS. We report a case of a manic episode after DBS of the subthalamic nucleus in a patient with advanced Parkinson's disease. After slow and gradually restart of the neurostimulation using the lowest effective intensity, the motor symptoms remained sufficiently under control without causing any psychiatric problems.",

    "abstract": "Because neurons are susceptible to oxidative damage and thioredoxin reductase 1 is extensively distributed in the central nervous system and has antioxidant properties, we speculated that the enzyme may be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. A Parkinson's disease model was produced by intraperitoneal injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine into C57BL/6 mice. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR, western blot analysis and colorimetric assay showed that the levels of thioredoxin reductase 1 mRNA and protein were decreased, along with a significant reduction in thioredoxin reductase activity, in the midbrain of Parkinson's disease mice compared with normal mice. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the number of thioredoxin reductase 1-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of Parkinson's disease mice was significantly decreased compared with normal mice. These experimental findings suggest that the expression of thioredoxin reductase 1 in the substantia nigra pars compacta of Parkinson's disease mice is significantly decreased, and that the enzyme may be associated with disease onset.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation has become a standard neurosurgical therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease. Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation can dramatically improve the motor symptoms of carefully selected patients with this disease. Surprisingly, some specific dimensions of quality of life, \"psychological\" aspects and social adjustment do not always improve, and they could sometimes be even worse. Patients and their families should fully understand that subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation can alter the motor status and time is needed to readapt to their new postoperative state and lifestyles. This paper reviews the literatures regarding effects of bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation on social adjustment, quality of life and coping strategies in patients with Parkinson's disease. The findings may help to understand the psychosocial maladjustment and poor improvement in quality of life in some Parkinson's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "Voxel-based morphometry can be used to quantitatively compare structural differences and func-tional changes of gray matter in subjects. In the present study, we compared gray matter images of 32 patients with Parkinson's disease and 25 healthy controls using voxel-based morphometry based on 3.0 T high-field magnetic resonance T1-weighted imaging and clinical neurological scale scores. Results showed that the scores in Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment were lower in patients compared with controls. In particular, the scores of visuospa-tial/executive function items in Montreal Cognitive Assessment were significantly reduced, but mean scores of non-motor symptoms significantly increased, in patients with Parkinson's disease. In dition, gray matter volume was significantly diminished in Parkinson's disease patients compared with normal controls, including bilateral temporal lobe, bilateral occipital lobe, bilateral parietal lobe, bilateral frontal lobe, bilateral insular lobe, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, bilateral amygdale, right uncus, and right posterior lobe of the cerebellum. These findings indicate that voxel-based phometry can accurately and quantitatively assess the loss of gray matter volume in patients with Parkinson' disease, and provide essential neuroimaging evidence for multisystem pathological mechanisms involved in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Psychosis is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease whose pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Parkinson's disease in conjunction with psychosis has been shown to induce injury to extracorticospinal tracts as well as within some cortical areas. In this study, Parkinson's disease patients with psychosis who did not receive antipsychotic treatment and those without psychosis underwent diffusion tensor imaging. Results revealed that in Parkinson's disease patients with psychosis, damage to the left frontal lobe, bilateral occipital lobe, left cingulated gyrus, and left hippocampal white-matter fibers were greater than damage to the substantia nigra or the globus pallidus. Damage to white-matter fibers in the right frontal lobe and right cingulate gyrus were also more severe than in the globus pallidus, but not the substantia nigra. Damage to frontal lobe and cingulate gyrus white-matter fibers was more apparent than that to occipital or hippocampal fiber damage. Compared with Parkinson's disease patients without psychosis, those with psychosis had significantly lower fractional anisotropy ratios of left frontal lobe, bilateral occipital lobe, left cingu-lated gyrus, and left hippocampus to ipsilateral substantia nigra or globus pallidus, indicating more severe damage to white-matter fibers. These results suggest that psychosis associated with Par-kinson's disease is probably associated with an imbalance in the ratio of white-matter fibers be-tween brain regions associated with psychiatric symptoms (frontal lobe, occipital lobe, cingulate gyrus, and hippocampus) and those associated with the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (the substantia nigra and globus pallidus). The relatively greater damage to white-matter fibers in psychiatric symptom-related brain regions than in extracorticospinal tracts might explain why chosis often occurs in Parkinson's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "There has been an increased interest in speech pattern analysis applications of Parkinsonism for building predictive telediagnosis and telemonitoring models. For this purpose, we have collected a wide variety of voice samples, including sustained vowels, words, and sentences compiled from a set of speaking exercises for people with Parkinson's disease. There are two main issues in learning from such a dataset that consists of multiple speech recordings per subject: 1) How predictive these various types, e.g., sustained vowels versus words, of voice samples are in Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis? 2) How well the central tendency and dispersion metrics serve as representatives of all sample recordings of a subject? In this paper, investigating our Parkinson dataset using well-known machine learning tools, as reported in the literature, sustained vowels are found to carry more PD-discriminative information. We have also found that rather than using each voice recording of each subject as an independent data sample, representing the samples of a subject with central tendency and dispersion metrics improves generalization of the predictive model.",

    "abstract": "Dementia is one of the most distressing and burdensome health problems associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA) is widely used to screen for dementia in PD patients, but the appropriate diagnostic cutoff score when used with Chinese PD patients is not known.\nDetermine a diagnostic cutoff value of the Chinese version of the MoCA (MoCA-C) for Chinese PD patients and describe the characteristics of PD patients screened positive for dementia using the MoCA-C.\nThe presence of dementia in 616 PD patients and 85 community controls was determined using the Movement Disorder Society Task Force criteria (the gold standard diagnosis). We administered the MoCA-C to these individuals and used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to identify the cutoff score of the MoCA-C that most efficiently identified dementia in both PD patients and community controls. Demographic and clinical characteristics of PD patients who were screened positive or negative for dementia using the MoCA-C were compared.\nA MoCA-C score of 23 was the optimal cutoff score for dementia in both patients and controls. Using this cutoff score, the sensitivity and specificity of the MoCA-C in PD patients were 0.70 and 0.77, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 0.59 and 0.85, respectively; and the overall concordance (kappa [95% confidence interval]) was 0.45 (0.39-0.52). The corresponding kappa value (concordance) in community controls was only 0.25 (0.05-0.45). Compared to PD patients who screened negative for dementia, those who screened positive for dementia were significantly impaired in all cognitive domains, including visuospatial and executive functioning, naming, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall and orientation (all p<0.001). Among the PD patients, screening positive for dementia was independently associated with old age, low educational attainment, female gender and more severe motor impairment.\nThe commonly recommended cutoff screening score for dementia of 26 on the MoCA it too high for PD patients in China; a cutoff score of 23 is more appropriate. Potential risk factors for dementia in Chinese PD patients include older age, less education, and more severe motor symptoms of PD.\n\u75f4\u5446\u662f\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u6c0f\u75c5(PD)\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6700\u75db\u82e6\u548c\u6700\u7e41\u91cd\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u8499\u7279\u5229\u5c14\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u8868(MOCA)\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u6c0f\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u75f4\u5446\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u600e\u6837\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5212\u754c\u5206\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u3002\n\u786e\u5b9a\u4e2d\u56fd\u7248\u8499\u7279\u5229\u5c14\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u8868(MoCA-C)\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u6c0f\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5212\u754c\u5206\u548c\u4e86\u89e3\u7ecfMoCA-C\u7b5b\u67e5\u75f4\u5446\u9633\u6027\u7684\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u6c0f\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u7279\u5f81\n\u91c7\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u969c\u788d\u5b66\u4f1a\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ec4\u6807\u51c6(\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u8bca\u65ad)\u786e\u5b9a616\u4f8b PD\u60a3\u8005\u548c85\u540d\u793e\u533a\u5bf9\u7167\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u75f4\u5446\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4eba\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86MoCA-C\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd0\u7528\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u5de5\u4f5c\u7279\u5f81(ROC)\u66f2\u7ebf\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u80fd\u591f\u6700\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u6c0f\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u548c\u793e\u533a\u5bf9\u7167\u4e2d\u75f4\u5446\u7684MoCA-C\u5212\u754c\u5206\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ecfMoCA-C\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e3a\u75f4\u5446\u9633\u6027\u4e0e\u9634\u6027\u7684PD\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u5b66\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7279\u5f81\u3002\nMoCA-C 23\u5206\u662f\u8bca\u65ad\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u6c0f\u60a3\u8005\u53ca\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u75f4\u5446\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5212\u754c\u5206\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u5212\u754c\u5206\uff0cPD\u60a3\u8005\u7684MoCA-C\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.70\u548c0.77\uff0c\u9633\u6027\u548c\u9634\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.59\u548c0.85\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u6027(kappa [95% \u53ef\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4])\u4e3a0.45 (0.39-0.52)\u3002\u793e\u533a\u5bf9\u7167\u76f8\u5e94\u7684kappa\u503c (\u4e00\u81f4\u6027)\u4ec5\u4e3a0.25 (0.05-0.45)\u3002\u4e0e\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e3a\u75f4\u5446\u9634\u6027\u7684PD\u60a3\u8005\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e3a\u75f4\u5446\u9633\u6027\u7684PD\u60a3\u8005\u6240\u6709\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u53d7\u635f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6267\u884c\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u547d\u540d\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u56de\u5fc6\u548c\u5b9a\u5411 (\u5747P<0.001)\u3002\u5728\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u6c0f\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e3a\u75f4\u5446\u9633\u6027\u4e0e\u5e74\u8001\uff0c\u6587\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e25\u91cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u969c\u788d\u72ec\u7acb\u76f8\u5173\u3002\n\u901a\u5e38\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u75f4\u5446\u5212\u754c\u520626\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e2d\u56fd\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u6765\u8bf4\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff1b23\u5206\u5212\u754c\u5206\u66f4\u52a0\u5408\u9002\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u6c0f\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u53d1\u751f\u75f4\u5446\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u5371\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u5305\u62ec\u5e74\u9f84\uff0c\u6587\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caPD\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u969c\u788d\u75c7\u72b6\u3002",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of FP-CIT PET template-based quantitative analysis on F-18 FP-CIT PET in patients with de novo Parkinson's disease (PD), compared with MR-based and manual methods. We also assessed the correlation of quantitative parameters of those methods with clinical severity of the disease.\nForty patients with de novo PD underwent both MRI and F-18 FP-CIT PET. Images were spatially normalized to a standardized PET template. Mean counts of 4 ROIs: putamen, caudate, occipital cortex and cerebellum, were obtained using the quantification program, Korean Statistical Probabilistic Anatomical Map (KSPAM). Putamen-to-caudate ratio (PCR), asymmetry index (ASI), specific-to-nonspecific ratios with two different references: to occipital cortex (SOR) and cerebellum (SCR) were compared. Parameters were also calculated from manually drawn ROI method and MR-coregistrated method.\nAll quantitative parameters showed significant correlations across the three different methods, especially between the PET-based and manual methods. Among them, PET-based SOR and SCR values showed an excellent correlation and concordance with those of manual method. In relationship with clinical severity, only ASI achieved significantly inverse correlations with H&Y stage and UPDRS motor score. There was no significant difference between the quantitative parameters of both occipital cortex and cerebellum in all three methods, which implied that quantitation using PET-based method could be reproducible regardless of the reference region.\nQuantitative parameters using FP-CIT PET template-based method correlated well with those using laborious manual method with excellent concordance. Moreover, PET-based quantitation was less influenced by the reference region than MR-based method. It suggests that PET-based method can provide objective and quantitative parameters quickly and easily as a feasible analysis in place of conventional method.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifocal degenerative disorder for which there is no cure. The majority of cases are sporadic with unknown etiology. Recent data indicate that untreated patients with de novo PD have increased colonic permeability and that both de novo and premotor patients have pathological expression of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) in their colon. Both endpoints potentially can serve as disease biomarkers and even may initiate PD events through gut-derived, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuronal injury. Animal models could be ideal for interrogating the potential role of the intestines in the pathogenesis of PD; however, few current animal models of PD encompass these nonmotor features. We sought to establish a progressive model of PD that includes the gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction present in human patients. C57/BL6 mice were systemically administered one dose of either LPS (2.5 mg/kg) or saline and were sacrificed in monthly intervals (n\u2009=\u20095 mice for 5 months) to create a time-course. Small and large intestinal permeability was assessed by analyzing the urinary output of orally ingested sugar probes through capillary column gas chromatography. \u03b1-Syn expression was assessed by counting the number of mildly, moderately, and severely affected myenteric ganglia neurons throughout the GI tract, and the counts were validated by quantitative optical density measurements. Nigrostriatal integrity was assessed by tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry stereology and densitometry. LPS caused an immediate and progressive increase in \u03b1-syn expression in the large intestine but not in the small intestine. Intestinal permeability of the whole gut (large and small intestines) progressively increased between months 2 and 4 after LPS administration but returned to baseline levels at month 5. Selective measurements demonstrated that intestinal permeability in the small intestine remained largely intact, suggesting that gut leakiness was predominately in the large intestine. Phosphorylated serine 129-\u03b1-syn was identified in a subset of colonic myenteric neurons at months 4 and 5. Although these changes were observed in the absence of nigrostriatal degeneration, an abrupt but insignificant increase in brainstem \u03b1-syn was observed that paralleled the restoration of permeability. No changes were observed over time in controls. LPS, an endotoxin used to model PD, causes sequential increases in \u03b1-syn immunoreactivity, intestinal permeability, and pathological \u03b1-syn accumulation in the colon in a manner similar to that observed in patients with PD. These features are observed without nigrostriatal degeneration and incorporate PD features before the motor syndrome. This allows for the potential use of this model in testing neuroprotective and disease-modifying therapies, including intestinal-directed therapies to fortify intestinal barrier integrity.",

    "abstract": "The neurobiology of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) reveals a number of unexpected areas which once were not recognized a priori as part of the neuropathology underlying PD. These areas may belong either to central nervous system or periphery. Among central areas major efforts in the last decade led to recognize a number of brain nuclei as part of the disease spreading or disease onset in PD patients. Unexpectedly recent evidence deriving from pathological studies in PD patients and corroborated by experimental models of PD provided clear evidence that the spinal cord is often recruited in PD pathology. Such an involvement is intriguing since the major degenerative disease of the spinal cord (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) features the involvement of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, while some environmental (parkinsonism, ALS, and dementia of Guam) and genetic (Kufor-Rakeb syndrome) diseases are known to be characterized by mixed degeneration of pyramidal and extrapyramidal regions. Thus, the clear-cut between degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the loss of pyramidal motor system appears now more as a continuum of \u00a0\u00a0degeneration which converge in abnormal activity and cell pathology of motor neurons as a final common pathway. Among motor neurons, visceral efferent cells of the spinal cord are involved and provide a robust neurobiological findings which may justify a variety of non-motor autonomic symptoms which characterize PD. Neurodegeneration in the spinal cord extends to the dorsal horn of the grey matter posing an intriguing link between PD and sensory alterations. The present manuscript reviews the involvement of multiple regions of the spinal cord in PD and experimental parkinsonism in the attempt to provide both a neurobiological background to understand non motor symptoms and to provide the anatomical basis for disease spreading.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) include a large variety of disorders that affects specific areas of the centralnervous system, leading to psychiatric and movement pathologies. A common feature that characterizes thesedisorders is the neuronal formation and accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates that lead to cell death. Inparticular, different proteinaceous aggregates accumulate to trigger a variety of clinical manifestations: prionprotein (PrPSc) in prion diseases, \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), \u03b1-synuclein in Parkinson's disease(PD), huntingtin in Huntington's disease (HD), superoxide dismutase and TDP-43 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS), tau in tauopathies. Non-motor alterations also occur in several viscera, in particular the gastrointestinaltract. These often precede the onset of motor symptoms by several years. For this reason, dysautonomic changescan be predictive of NDs and their correct recognition is being assuming a remarkable importance. This peculiarfeature led more and more to the concept that neurodegeneration may initiate in the periphery and propagate retrogradelytowards the central nervous system in a prion-like manner. In recent years, a particular attention wasdedicated to the clinical assessment of autonomic disorders in patients affected by NDs. In this respect, experimentalanimal models have been developed to understand the neurobiology underlying these effects as well as toinvestigate autonomic changes in peripheral organs. This review summarizes experimental studies that have beencarried out to understand autonomic symptoms in NDs, with the purpose to provide appropriate tools for comprehensiveand integrated studies.",

    "abstract": "Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is diagnosed on the basis of motor symptoms, including slowness of movement, tremor, rigidity and difficulties with balance and walking, now we are aware that non-motor symptoms are highly prevalent, since they can anticipate motor symptoms and can cause severe consequences. Several studies have shown that non-motor symptoms, such as depression, anxiety and apathy, psychosis (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), sleep disturbance, and pain may have a greater adverse impact on quality of life and health economics compared with motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms can be divided into four domains: neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression, anxiety, apathy, hallucinations, dementia), autonomic (e.g., constipation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary changes, sweating abnormalities), sleep (e.g., insomnia, sleep fragmentation, excessive daytime sleepiness, rapid eye movement, sleep behavioural disorder, restless leg syndrome), and sensory dysfunction (e.g., pain, olfactory dysfunction). This review addresses diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. The causative mechanisms remain complex, since they reflect the widespread brainstem and cortical pathology of PD, with involvement of several neurotransmitters, including dopamine (DA), serotonin, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine. The diagnosis is often challenging, especially for psychiatric disorders, and in particular affective disorders, because somatic features of psychopathology may overlap with the movement disorder itself. Treatments used are limited and psychiatric drugs may not be as effective as in general population. Evidence based medicine is quite poor and it still requires well-designed clinical studies.",

This requires a proper characterization of the natural history of the disease using the appropriate epidemiological tools, along with the implementation in clinical practice of a standard a multi-professional approach. Available evidence on the frequency of non-motor symptoms in PD is reported in studies with very heterogeneous designs and diagnostic measures, and using a great variety of epidemiological estimates. In particular, there are no studies reporting the frequency of non-motor symptoms in a cohort of incident PD patients using point prevalence, incidence rate, and cumulative incidence. A mini-review of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on three non-motor symptoms/conditions (dementia, depression, ICDs) in patients with PD confirms these premises and highlights the need of higher quality studies, both from a methodological and a clinical point of view.",

The present Editorial encompasses epidemiological and clinical studies on PD patients joined with experimental findings to provide a novel definition of PD based on clinical, neuroanatomical and neurobiological findings.In fact, the plethora of symptoms described in PD patients are due to specific anatomical alterations which cluster in specific disease phenotypes. These PDs differ for disease onset and progression, disease severity and specific cluster of non-motor disturbances. Despite the variety of PD phenotypes, it is now well established that in almost all PD subgroups (except those autosomic recessive selective disorders exemplified by Parkin disease) a core anatomical defniition exists recruiting a variety of brainstem monoamine nuclei. Such a variety of PD pathologies can be defined as monoamine brainstem disorder (MBD).",

WMH were rated using the semiquantitative visual rating system proposed by Scheltens et al.\nThe presence of orthostatic hypotension was associated with increasing tendency of WMH score and the blood pressure changes during tilting and supine blood pressure were positively correlated with increasing WMH score.\nThis finding indicates that hemodynamic changes associated with orthostatic hypotension may be associated with white matter changes in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is defined as the presence of an accessory atrioventricular pathway which is manifested as delta waves and short PR interval on electrocardiography (ECG). However, some WPW cases do not have typical findings on ECG and may remain undiagnosed unless palpitations occur. Sudden cardiac death may be the first manifestation of WPW and develops mostly secondary to degeneration of atrial fibrillation into ventricular fibrillation. In this report, we present a case of undiagnosed WPW with minimal preexcitation on ECG and who suffered an episode of malignant arrhythmia as the first manifestation of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Bullous pemphigoid (BP) and psoriasis vulgaris represent two clinically well characterized, inflammatory, chronic skin diseases. A 62 years old female patient, from rural areas, was admitted for the presence of erythematous plaques covered by large tense blisters with clear fluid, located symmetrically on the anterior part of the upper limbs, the trunk, the neck and the lower limbs. Also the lesions were intense itching. Lesions occurred three days before presentation at the clinic. Medical history revealed psoriasis diagnosed 28 years ago, breast cancer treated with surgery, radio and chemotherapy three years ago and Parkinson's disease diagnosed 3 weeks prior to presentation to the dermatology clinic. Histopathology examination revealed: atrophic epidermis with subepidermal presence of a blister containing numerous eosinophils and neutrophils. In the papillary dermis neutrophils and eosinophils predominantly vascular. Bullous pemphigoid has multiple etiology. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune subepidermal bullous dermatosis which may be associated with psoriasis. Medical literature and cases reported in dermatology journals claim that bullous pemphigoid is often associated with psoriasis, though the immunogenetical and immunopathologycal mecanismes are still not known. Our patient has three different diseases but their etiology and pathogenesis can interfere.",

    "abstract": "In view of documented evidence demonstrating the association of dopaminergic metabolism and neurotransmission with Parkinson's disease (PD), a case-control study was conducted to investigate the impact of particular polymorphisms in the catechol O-methyl transferase (COMT) H108L, monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) int 13 A>G, dopamine transporter 1 (DAT1) A1215G, dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) Taq1A, DRD2 Taq1B and DRD2 Taq1D genes on the susceptibility to PD. PCR-RFLP method was used for the genetic analysis. The COMT H108L polymorphism increased PD risk by 1.4-fold (95%CI: 1.02-1.98), whereas reduced risk was observed with MAOB int 13 A>G polymorphism (OR: 0.77, 95%CI: 0.51-0.99). Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis showed gene-gene interactions between these two loci that resulted in loss of the protective role of MAOB G-allele in the presence of COMT L-allele. DAT1A1215G polymorphism in the exon 9 was not associated with PD. Individually, DRD2 polymorphisms showed null association. However, all-variant haplotype of DRD2 locus i.e. T-G-T haplotype showed 29.8-fold risk for PD compared to all-wild haplotype i.e., C-A-C haplotype (95%CI: 6.85-130.4). To conclude, genetic variants of COMT, MAOB and DRD2 loci modulate susceptibility to PD in South Indian subjects.",

    "abstract": "Physical therapy, including exercise, improves gait and quality of life in Parkinson's disease (PD). Many programs promoting physical activity have generated significant short-term gains, but adherence has been a problem. A recent evidence-based analysis of clinical trials using physical therapy in PD patients produced four key treatment recommendations: cognitive movement strategies, physical capacity, balance training, and cueing. We have attempted to incorporate all four of these features together through a dance exercise program using the dance videogame \"Dance Dance Revolution\" (DDR) (Konami Digital Entertainment, El Segundo, CA).\nSixteen medically stable participants with mild to moderate PD were given the opportunity to try DDR with supervision by a research staff member. Feedback about the advantages and disadvantages of DDR as a form of physical activity was elicited through focus groups using the nominal group technique.\nOf 21 advantages and 17 disadvantages elicited, the most frequently cited advantages were \"fun\" and \"easy to use,\" followed by \"improves balance or coordination,\" \"challenging,\" and \"full body aerobic activity.\" Common concerns were the distracting or confusing interface, cost, and possible technical issues.\nInteractive dance exercise was appealing to participants with PD and may help promote adherence to physical activity. Concerns regarding familiarity with the technology may be addressed with simplification of the interface or additional training for participants. Results support a larger longitudinal study of DDR in PD.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the use of an instrumented balance test based on inertial sensors was evaluated in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to objectively characterize motor subtypes of PD [tremor dominant (TD) and postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD)], to help to quantitatively classify the PD subjects into motor subtypes. Subjects were studied performing postural tests, while wearing a device including a tri-axial accelerometer on the lower back, in four different experimental conditions that depended on feet position (feet-together or semi-tandem) and vision (eyes open or closed). Postural measures, after a reliability check, were tested to identify their sensitivity to the disease, to the PD subtypes, and to the experimental conditions. The results highlight the possibility of distinguishing between the TD and PIGD subtypes by means of objective postural measures that are able to detect tremor and PIGD features and are able to classify a subject as TD or PIGD with good accuracy. Feet position influences frequency measures, whereas eyes closure influences the displacement measures and enhances differences between PD and control subjects, suggesting that postural displacement measures may be capable of detecting different adaptation processes to external sensory conditions between patients with PD and control subjects.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is characterized by a wide range of motor and non-motor symptoms. In the last years the evaluation of cognitive functioning, emotional aspects and health status of PD patients has became ever-growing important.\nIn this article a neuropsychological and psychological assessment model, by means of tests and interviews, and a clinical approach to the narrative themes are described. Areas of clinical investigation: cognitive processing, emotional acceptance and behavioural adaptation to the disease, motivation to rehabilitation treatment, expectations regarding functional recovery, adherence, social and family perceived support, mood, awareness of possible cognitive deficits. Tests assessment (based on specific cognitive deficits related to PD): MMSE, FAB, TMTA-B, Phonological verbal fluency test, Stroop test, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) or Beck Depression Inventory- BDI-II and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8 (PDQ-8). The psychological approach, which is part of an interdisciplinary rehabilitative intervention, is based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and it is focused on disease management even in the absence, sometimes, of a significant general emotional status modification and it is aimed at improving patient's adaptability, self-management and empowerment. In order to describe the model, the clinical and test data of two PD patients are illustrated.\nThe added value of this psychological approach lies in the clinical data integration of the test evaluation, the narrative aspects and the information mediated by the inter-professional team. This model allows a deeper and more personalized identification of the patient's subjective adjustment process according to his/her personal needs and resources.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are among the most common neurodegenerative disorders affecting older populations. AD is characterized by impaired memory and cognitive decline while the primary symptoms of PD include resting tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity. In PD, mild cognitive changes are frequently present, which could progress to dementia (PD dementia (PDD)). PDD and AD dementias are different in pathology although the difference in microstructural changes remains unknown. To further understand these diseases, it is essential to understand the distinct mechanism of their microstructural changes. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate white matter tract differences between early stage individuals with AD (n=14), PD (n=12), PDD (n=9), and healthy non-demented controls (CON) (n=13). We used whole brain tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) and a region of interest (ROI) analysis focused on the substantia nigra (SN). We found that individuals with PDD had more widespread white matter degeneration compared to PD, AD, and CON. Individuals with AD had few regional abnormalities in the anterior and posterior projections of the corpus callosum while PD and CON did not appear to have significant white matter degeneration when compared to other groups. ROI analyses showed that PDD had the highest diffusivity in the SN and were significantly different from CON. There were no significant ROI differences between CON, PD, or AD. In conclusion, global white matter microstructural deterioration is evident in individuals with PDD, and DTI may provide a means with which to tease out pathological differences between AD and PD dementias.",

    "abstract": "The last twenty years have witnessed a surge of interest in the autonomic symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the possibilities to diagnose and treat them. The specialized questionnaire assessing the autonomic symptoms in Parkinson's disease (SCOPA-AUT) has been validated and available in English, Dutch and Spanish. In this study we aim at evaluating the validity, reliability and applicability of the Bulgarian version of SCOPA-AUT (SCOPA-AUT-BG).\nThe study included 55 patients with idiopathic PD (mean age 64.4 +/- 8.9 yrs), and 40 healthy controls (mean age 58.5 +/- 9.4 yrs). Clinical severity and disease stage were assessed by United Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPRDS) and Hoen and Yahr (H&Y). Thirty-two of the PD patients completed SCOPA-AUT-BG again after a 7-day interval. Questionnaire reliability was analyzed by determining the internal consistency, homogeneity, discriminatory and construct validity and test-retest reliability.\nAnalyses showed good internal consistency of the summary evaluation of SCOPA-AUT-BG (coefficient alpha of Cronbach = 0.79), which indicates the high reliability of the questionnaire. The lowest Cronbach's alpha coefficient (0.53) was found for the subscale \"cardiovascular functions\". A dominant role belongs to the subscales for gastrointestinal and urinary functions (Cronbach's Alpha > 0.7), where a significantly high correlation of PD with the UPDRS scale was observed. We found high test-retest reliability based on the responses associated with dysfunction of the gastrointestinal, urinary, thermoregulatory and pupillary autonomic systems. The correlation of the results of SCOPA-AUT-BG with UPDRS is higher than that with H&Y, and the construct validity is high except for the cardiovascular and pupillomotor functions subscales.\nThe results of this study show that SCOPA-AUT-BG is a valid and reliable specialized questionnaire to evaluate autonomic function in patients with Parkinson's disease. Using it allows for more detailed clinical evaluation of these patients and justifies the need to refer them to specialized examination of autonomic functions.",

    "abstract": "We herein report the case of a 67-year-old Japanese man diagnosed with sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) at 52 years of age who presented with oculogyric crisis (OGC) in the off period. Ordinarily, OGC is caused by postencephalitic parkinsonism or the chronic use of antidopaminergic medications. The OGC began at 65 years of age and was associated with the wearing-off of symptoms. The dominant OGC feature was tonic deviations in eye posture induced by looking upward with prominent retrocollis. The administration of control dopaminergic medications led to improvements in the wearing-off phenomenon and OGC. This observation confirms that sporadic PD can induce OGC in the off period.",

    "abstract": "The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines state that palliative care options for people with Parkinson's disease (PD) should be discussed.\nTo investigate whether palliative care guidelines are adhered to for people with PD who die in hospital.\nThe medical notes of all people with a diagnosis of idiopathic PD who were living in two adjacent areas of northeast England and who died over a 3-year period were examined. Demographic data and specific information regarding events around the time of death were recorded.\nFor the 236 patients identified, the average age at death was 82.8 years. Of these patients, 110 (46.6%) died in hospital, 56 (23.7%) at home, 59 (25.0%) in a care home and for 11 patients (4.7%) the place of death was not recorded. For those who died in hospital, only three patients, and seven relatives of patients, had had a recorded discussion with a clinician regarding their preferred place of death and only 15 (13.6%) were referred to a specialist palliative care team. Forty-six patients (41.8%) were placed on the Liverpool Care Pathway.\nFor those dying in hospital, there are few previously documented end-of-life care discussions with patients or their relatives. The use of end-of-life pathways and access to specialist palliative care is variable. Following the Neuberger report, the Liverpool Care Pathway is to be replaced with individual end-of-life care plans. It is important to engage patients, and their relatives, in decision making regarding preferences at the end of life.",

    "abstract": "Pain is a non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that is often neglected due to its high prevalence in both the PD and the normal elderly population. The aims of this cross-sectional study were to establish the prevalence of pain, investigate its clinical predictors and analyze physical experiences of pain as described by PD patients. A total of 121 patients diagnosed with PD were included. The patients underwent a neurological examination and a structured interview and completed questionnaires focusing on clinical types and physical experiences of pain. Logistic regressions were used to analyze possible predictors. Pain was reported by 80 (66%) patients with a mean age at PD diagnosis of 67.26\u00b111.43 years. The most common clinical types of pain experienced by the patients were dystonic pain (48%), paresthesia/neuropathic pain (36%) and musculoskeletal pain (28%). The PD patients described their physical experience of pain as aching (46%), a feeling of tension (18%), sharp pain (12%), deep pain (12%) and dull pain (11%). Patients with PD affecting the right side of the body were four times more likely to report pain on the right side of the body; however, no such relation was found for the left side of the body. A higher UPDRS-III scale score and longer PD duration reduced the likelihood of patients reporting dull pain. The presence of paresthesia/neuropathic pain was shown to decrease the likelihood of patients reporting sharp pain. No significant relationships were found between the magnitude of pain and gender, age at PD diagnosis, PD duration, UPDRS-III score, or Hoehn and Yahr stage of PD. Although 40% of the PD patients felt that medication had a (direct) effect on their pain, no relationship could be found between pain severity and PD medication.",

    "abstract": "An increased R2 recovery component of the blink reflex (R2-BRrc) has been observed in Parkinson's disease (PD), cranio-cervical dystonia, dystonic tremor and essential tremor with associated resting tremor (rET), while the BRrc was reported normal in patients with essential tremor (ET). Distinguishing rET from tremor dominant PD (tPD) may be challenging especially in the first stages of the diseases, in the absence of DAT-SPECT investigation. We evaluated the possible usefulness of BRrc for differentiating subjects with de novo tPD from those with rET. We investigated R2-BRrc at interstimulus intervals (ISI) of 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 750 ms in 11 participants with tPD, 10 with rET and 20 healthy controls. All participants underwent DAT-SPECT and cardiac MIBG scintigraphy. R2 recovery was significantly enhanced in tPD compared to controls at all investigated ISIs (p < 0.001), while in subjects with rET patients BRrc was significantly increased compared to controls at ISI 150, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 750 ms (p < 0.001). At ISI 100 R2-BRrc distinguished patients participants with de novo tPD from those with rET with a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 100%. Our findings demonstrate the usefulness of BRrc for differentiating de novo tPD from rET.",

    "abstract": "To study the effect of Bushen Huoxue Herbs on depression of patients with Parkinson's disease.\nNinety-six patients were randomized into two groups with 46 patients in the treatment group and 50 patients in the control group. Both groups took western medicine as basic treatment. The treatment group was treated with Bushen Huoxue Herbs additionally. The observation was carried out for 9 months. Used Encephalofluctuograph Technology (ET) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) to measure the changes of cerebral neurotransmitters and scale scores in both groups at baseline time, 3, 6 and 9 months later to evaluate the effects of Bushen Huoxue Herbs.\nIn the treatment group, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), noradrenaline (NE) and dopamine (DA) levels were increased significantly when compared with pretreatment (P < 0.05), especially of 5-HT and DA levels (P < 0.01); Compared with the control group, 5-HT and DA levels were increased significantly (P < 0.05). After treatment, the scores of the HAMD scale was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). No adverse effects were found in this trial.\nBushen Huoxue Herbs can improve depression of PD patients by increasing the levels of 5-HT, NE and DA in the brain and decreasing the scores of the HAMD scale with reliable effects.",

    "abstract": "In the course of Parkinson's disease, advanced and late stages can be distinguished. In the advanced stage, levodopa has good effect on motor symptoms, but patient care is often hindered by levodopa-induced complications such as motor fluctuation and dyskinesias. In the late stage levodopa response becomes poor, falls, dementia and psychotic symptoms appear and patients often need hospitalization. In the advanced stage, the quality of life may be improved better by device-aided therapy than by best oral medical treatment. The alternatives are apomorhin pump, levodopa carbidopa intestinal gel with pump and deep brain stimulation. The therapy plan should be based on the principle: \"the right treatment, to the right patient, at the right time\".",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease result from the death of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain; the cause of this cell death is unknown. Homocysteine (Hcy) is a non-protein amino acid. It is a homologue of the amino acid cysteine. The elevated levels of homocysteine in plasma have been associated with a number of disease states. Hcy (2 \u00b5mol / \u00b5l) was injected intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) in rats, five days later, the locomotor activity was measured with open field apparatus, Also apoptosis was investigated in substantia nigra cells by immunohistochemical analysis. Hcy could decrease locomotor activities significantly in rats as well as it could induce apoptosis in substantia nigra cells. These results suggest that Hcy is a neurotoxic metabolite and may induce cell death in some nuclei in the brain.",

    "abstract": "In the last years due to development of molecular methods a substantial progress in understanding of genetic associations with drug effects in many clinical disciplines has been observed. The efforts to define the role of genetic polymorphisms in optimizing pharmacotherapy of Parkinson's disease (PD) were also undertaken. So far, some promising genetic loci for PD treatment were determined. In the review pharmacogenetic aspects of levodopa, dopamine agonists and COMT inhibitors are discussed.",

Although much research remains to be done, the main genetic causes of this neurodegenerative disorder are now partially unraveled, allowing us to feel more confident that our knowledge about the genetic architecture of PD will continue to increase exponentially. How and when these discoveries will be introduced into general clinical practice, however, remains uncertain. In this review, we provide a general summary of the progress in the genetics of PD and discuss how this knowledge will contribute to the diagnosis and clinical management of patients with, or at risk of this disorder.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are the major factors implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. The maintenance of healthy mitochondria is a very complex process coordinated bi-genomically. Here, we review association studies on mitochondrial haplogroups and subhaplogroups, discussing the underlying molecular mechanisms. We also focus on variation in the nuclear genes (NDUFV2, PGC-1alpha, HSPA9, LRPPRC, MTIF3, POLG1, and TFAM encoding NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein 2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, mortalin, leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing protein, translation initiation factor 3, mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, and mitochondrial transcription factor A, respectively) primarily linked to regulation of mitochondrial functioning that recently have been associated with PD risk. Possible interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear genetic variants and related proteins are discussed.",

    "abstract": "An elevated concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy) in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid is considered to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Homocysteine (Hcy) levels are influenced by folate concentrations and numerous genetic factors through the folate cycle, however, their role in the pathogenesis of PD remains controversial. Hcy exerts a neurotoxic action and may participate in the mechanisms of neurodegeneration, such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, calcium accumulation, and apoptosis. Elevated Hcy levels can lead to prooxidative activity, most probably through direct interaction with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and sensitization of dopaminergic neurons to age-related dysfunction and death. Several studies have shown that higher concentration of Hcy in PD is related to long-term administration of levodopa (L-dopa). An elevation of plasma tHcy levels can also reflect deficiencies of cofactors in remethylation of Hcy to methionine (Met) (folates and vitamin B12) and in its transsulfuration to cysteine (Cys) (vitamin B6). It is believed that the increase in the concentration of Hcy in PD can affect genetic polymorphisms of the folate metabolic pathway genes, such as MTHFR (C677T, A1298C and G1793A), MTR (A2756G), and MTHFD1 (G1958A), whose frequencies tend to increase in PD patients, as well as the reduced concentration of B vitamins. In PD, increased levels of Hcy may lead to dementia, depression and progression of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Epinephrine (E) and sympathetic nerve stimulation were described by Thomas Renton Elliott in 1905 for the first time. Dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), E, and serotonin (5-HT) belong to the classic biogenic amines (or monoamines). Parkinson's disease (PD) is among the diseases in which it has been established that catecholamines may account for the neurodegeneration of central and peripheral catecholamine neural systems. PD is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, affecting 2% of individuals above the age of 65 years. This disorder is a result of degeneration of DA-producing neurons of the substantia nigra and a significant loss of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. In PD and other related neurodegerative diseases, catecholamines play the role of endogenous neurotoxins. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and/or monoamine oxidase (MAO) catalyze the metabolism of monoamines. However, the monoamine transporters for DA, NE, and 5-HT namely DAT, NET, and SERT, respectively regulate the monoamine concentration. The metabolism of catecholamines and 5-HT involves common factors. Monoamine transporters represent targets for many pharmacological agents that affect brain function, including psychostimulators and antidepressants. In PD, polymorphisms of the COMT, MAO, DAT, NET, and 5- HTT genes may change the levels of biogenic amines and their metabolic products. The currently available therapies for PD improve the symptoms but do not halt the progression of the disease. The most effective treatment for PD patients is therapy with L-dopa. Combined therapy for PD involves a DA agonist and decarboxylase, MAOs and COMT inhibitors, and is the current optimal form of PD treatment maintaining monoamine balance.",

    "abstract": "Although Parkinson's disease (PD) was first described almost 200 years ago, it remains an incurable disease with a cause that is not fully understood. Nowadays it is known that disturbances in the structure of pathological proteins in PD can be caused by more than environmental and genetic factors. Despite numerous debates and controversies in the literature about the role of mutations in the SNCA and PRKN genes in the pathogenesis of PD, it is evident that these genes play a key role in maintaining dopamine (DA) neuronal homeostasis and that the dysfunction of this homeostasis is relevant to both familial (FPD) and sporadic (SPD) PD with different onset. In recent years, the importance of alphasynuclein (ASN) in the process of neurodegeneration and neuroprotective function of the Parkin is becoming better understood. Moreover, there have been an increasing number of recent reports indicating the importance of the interaction between these proteins and their encoding genes. Among others interactions, it is suggested that even heterozygous substitution in the PRKN gene in the presence of the variants +2/+2 or +2/+3 of NACP-Rep1 in the SNCA promoter, may increase the risk of PD manifestation, which is probably due to ineffective elimination of over-expressed ASN by the mutated Parkin protein. Finally, it seems that genetic testing may be an important part of diagnostics in patients with PD and may improve the prognostic process in the course of PD. However, only full knowledge of the mechanism of the interaction between the genes associated with the pathogenesis of PD is likely to help explain the currently unknown pathways of selective damage to dopaminergic neurons in the course of PD.",

    "abstract": "Intensive research over the last 15 years has led to the identification of several autosomal recessive and dominant genes that cause familial Parkinson's disease (PD). Importantly, the functional characterization of these genes has shed considerable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the etiology and pathogenesis of PD. Collectively; these studies implicate aberrant protein and mitochondrial homeostasis as key contributors to the development of PD, with oxidative stress likely acting as an important nexus between the two pathogenic events. Interestingly, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed variations in at least two of the identified familial PD genes (i.e. \u03b1-synuclein and LRRK2) as significant risk factors for the development of sporadic PD. At the same time, the studies also uncovered variability in novel alleles that is associated with increased risk for the disease. Additionally, in-silico meta-analyses of GWAS data have allowed major steps into the investigation of the roles of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in sporadic PD. The emergent picture from the progress made thus far is that the etiology of sporadic PD is multi-factorial and presumably involves a complex interplay between a multitude of gene networks and the environment. Nonetheless, the biochemical pathways underlying familial and sporadic forms of PD are likely to be shared.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate general knowledge on Parkinson's disease (PD) among patients with PD and current status and choices regarding diagnosis and treatment of PD among general neurologists from grassroots hospitals of Sichuan Province, China.\nCross-sectional questionnaire-based surveys were conducted among 344 PD patients and 368 general neurologists from grassroots hospitals in Sichuan Province, China from October 2010 to October 2012. One questionnaire was developed and distributed for the patient survey on general knowledge on PD, and another one for the neurologist survey on diagnosis and treatment of PD.\nPD patients lacked information about some aspects of PD, such as etiology, side effects of antiparkinsonian drugs, use of levodopa, and surgical treatment. Patients obtained information about PD mainly from their treating clinician. Neurologists from grassroots hospitals did not have sufficient awareness and knowledge of certain aspects of PD, including non-motor symptoms, differential diagnosis, therapeutic strategy, or appropriate indications of surgical treatment, although they were familiar with the motor symptoms of the disease.\nBoth PD patients and neurologists from grassroots hospitals had minimal knowledge about the disease. Improved knowledge about PD may contribute to maintaining patients' quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PITX3 gene have been associated with the risk for Parkinson's disease (PD). We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis including all the studies published on the risk of PD related with these polymorphisms.\nThe systematic review was done using several databases. Eligible studies were included in the meta-analysis that was carried out using Meta-DiSc 1.1.1 software. Heterogeneity between studies was tested using the Q-statistic.\nThe meta-analysis included eight association studies for the PITX3 rs3758549 SNP (4,052 PD patients, 3,949 controls), eight studies for the PITX3 rs2281983 SNP (4,309 PD patients, 4,287 controls), and six studies for the rs4919621 SNP (2,724 PD patients, 2,285 controls), and the risk for PD, global diagnostic odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for rs3758549, rs2281983, and rs4919621 were, respectively, 1.00 (0.89-1.12) (p = 0.979), 0.99 (0.91-1.09) (p = 0.896), and 0.98 (0.83-1.16) (p = 0.844) for the total group. The separate analysis in Caucasian and Chinese subjects on the frequency of the minor allele of the three SNPs analyzed did not show significant differences between PD patients and controls in both subgroups. rs2281983 and rs4919621 SNPs were related with early-onset PD risk in Caucasians.\nThe results of the meta-analysis suggest that rs3758549, rs2281983, and rs4919621 SNPs are not major determinants of the risk for PD.",

    "abstract": "Metformin is widely used to treat type II diabetes and other metabolic syndromes. In addition, it has been shown to increase neurogenesis, spatial memory formation and reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease. On this basis, the aim of the present study was the investigation of the protective potential of metformin in the haloperidol-induced catalepsy model of Parkinson's disease in mice. The effect of metformin (20 - 100mg/kg, p.o) on motor coordination was assessed using rotarod and forced swimming tests (FST), while the effect on memory function was evaluated using the Y-maze test. The neuroprotective activity was investigated in acute/chronic (21days) haloperidol-induced catalepsy in mice. On the 21st day, biochemical estimation of nitrosative and oxidative stress parameters was carried out. Metformin (50 or 100mg/kg, p.o.) did not affect motor coordination in rotarod test and FST but significantly reversed haloperidol-induced memory deficit (+35.50%) at 100mg/kg. Importantly, metformin significantly reduced the duration of catalepsy score during acute and chronic catalepsy tests as compared to trihexylphenidyl (reference standard). Intraperitoneal chronic injection of haloperidol (1mg/kg) significantly increased malondialdehyde and nitrite levels, while it significantly attenuated the activity of reduced glutathione, catalase and superoxide dismutase. Moreover, oral chronic administration of metformin significantly attenuated the haloperidol-induced increase of malondialdehyde and nitrite, as well as the deficit of glutathione and catalase. These findings suggest that metformin protects against haloperidol-induced catalepsy through inhibition of oxidative/nitrosative stress and has the potential for adjuvant action in the management of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Impaired gait initiation (GI) in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) is a typical functional sign of akinesia. Failure to initiate the first step is frequently presented by patients with freezing of gait (FOG) and is often considered a sub-type of freezing. The literature on the effects of cueing of GI preparation and execution remains controversial. Our objective was to establish whether auditory cueing improves the preparation and/or execution of GI in PD patients with a history of FOG.\nWe recorded first-step preparation and execution in 30 PD patients with confirmed FOG under two randomised conditions: self-triggered (ST) gait and gait cued by a sound beep in off- and on-dopa conditions. Anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) were evaluated by monitoring the trajectory of the centre of pressure.\nWe compared the patients with 30 patients without history of FOG and 30 healthy controls (HCs). l-Dopa only slightly improved the characteristics of APAs in freezers but was effective to improve gait hypokinesia. Auditory cueing was effective in improving step preparation in freezers, who showed adequate APAs more frequently. As seen with HCs and patients without FOG, patients released their APAs more quickly when auditory cueing was applied. However, cueing did not have a significant effect on step length. Clinically, auditory cueing also improved start hesitation in freezers.\nAuditory cueing improved step preparation but not step execution in PD patients.\nA failure to link step preparation and execution during GI may explain the poor first-step execution seen in PD freezers.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a potential predictor of future cognitive decline or dementia. We investigated whether SCD in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is a predictor of future cognitive decline. Forty-six cognitively normal patients with PD were selected using comprehensive neuropsychological tests, and classified depending on the presence (PD-SCD(+), n = 25) or absence of SCD (PD-SCD(-), n = 21). After a mean follow-up of 2.4 years, we repeated the cognitive assessments with the same subjects. The clinical characteristics and cognitive performance of the 2 groups did not differ at baseline. At the follow-up assessment, 11 patients in the PD-SCD(+) group (44.0%) and 2 in the PD-SCD(-) group (9.5%) were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and the PD-SCD(+) patients showed more rapid decline in semantic fluency and visuospatial memory tasks than those in the PD-SCD(-) group. A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that presence of SCD (odds ratio, 8.378; 95% confidential interval, 1.472-47.683, p = 0.017) and higher Unified PD Rating Scale motor score of 20 or more (odds ratio, 4.539; 95% confidential interval, 1.004-20.528; p = 0.049) were risk factors for incident MCI. Present results demonstrate that SCD in cognitively normal patients with PD is an independent risk factor for incident MCI and acts as a predictor for future cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Both stabilization and orientation components of postural control are affected in Parkinson's disease (PD). These deficits are partly due to proprioceptive impairments, which frequently coexist with a visual dependence. This study aimed to evaluate if a visual biofeedback -\u00a0i.e. real time anteroposterior trunk and head orientations indicated with a simplified avatar and represented in a head-mounted display\u00a0- could improve the postural control of PD patients in response to a postural disturbance. The influence of focusing on one specific component of the postural control (stabilization or orientation) was also examined.\nSeventeen medicated PD patients performed sequences of pull-tests, either with eyes open, eyes closed or visual biofeedback, crossed with the verbal instruction to focus either on the stabilization or on the vertical body orientation. Kinematics data were collected.\nBackward trunk tilts consequent to the pulls were unchanged across the different conditions. With eyes open and eyes closed, patients did not recover their initial vertical orientation by adopting a slightly tilted backward position. This bias disappeared with the visual biofeedback. Moreover, falls consecutive to the test were significantly less frequent with the visual biofeedback than in the two other visual conditions. These different orientation and stabilization parameters were not affected by the instruction.\nUnlike a verbal instruction, visualizing in real time their own body's geometry improved both components of postural control of PD patients. This provides evidences in PD about links between impaired vertical orientation, deficits in balance control, and contribution of supplementary sensory cues.",

    "abstract": "The gait initiation process is of particular interest in Parkinson's disease because it combines motor and cognitive components of movement preparation (referred to as anticipatory postural adjustments) and movement execution (the step by itself). Moreover, gait initiation in Parkinson's disease is often affected by motor blocks (a subtype of the \"freezing of gait\" phenomenon). Gait initiation disturbances in Parkinson's disease include delayed release of anticipatory postural adjustments, hypokinetic anticipatory postural adjustments (reduced scaling) and bradykinetic anticipatory postural adjustments (abnormal timing). The most extreme form is freezing of gait with sometimes the absence of anticipatory postural adjustments. Other phenomena can be also described in some freezing patients (such as multiple anticipatory postural adjustments, described clinically as \"knee trembling\"). The fact that emotion, attention, external triggers and dopaminergic drugs can all modify this motor program suggests the existence of a complex pathophysiological mechanism that involves not only locomotor networks but also cortical areas and the basal ganglia system. Abnormal coupling between standing posture and anticipatory postural adjustments and between the latter and step execution appears to be a crucial part of the pathophysiological mechanism. Although external cueing appears to be of interest, few studies have provided evidence of the efficacy of various rehabilitation methods in routine care.",

    "abstract": "An 80-year-old woman with Parkinson's disease was scheduled for open heart surgery to repair thoracic aortic aneurysm. Parkinson's symptoms were normally treated using oral levodopa (200 mg), selegiline-hydrochloride (5 mg), bromocriptine-mesilate (2 mg), and amantadine-hydrochloride (200 mg) daily. On the day before surgery, levodopa 50mg was infused intravenously. Another 25 mg of levodopa was infused immediately after surgery. Twenty hours later, the patient developed tremors, heyperventilation, but no obvious muscle rigidity. Two days after surgery, the patient exhibited high fever, hydropoiesis, elevated creatine kinase, and a rise in blood leukocytes. She was diagnosed with neuroleptic malignant syndrome. She was intubated, and received dantrolene sodium. Symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome disappeared on the fourth postoperative day. The stress of open heart surgery, specifically extracorporeal circulation and concomitant dilution of levodopa, triggered neuroleptic malignant syndrome in this patient. Parkinson's patients require higher doses of levodopa prior to surgery to compensate and prevent neuroleptic malignant syndrome after surgery.",

    "abstract": "A number of gender differences have been documented in the incidence and symptomatology of the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Overall, previous reports suggest a less frequent incidence and a more benign phenotype in women mainly in Western populations, which is thought to be mediated by estrogens in particular in early stages of the disease. Not only motor symptoms seem to underlie gender effects, but also non-motor symptoms such as psychiatric and cognitive impairments, which can often precede motor manifestation. However, reliable results for gender differences in PD in particular of cognitive function and emotion processing, having a major impact on quality of life, are lacking. Moreover, studies investigating gender effects in PD in these areas have revealed highly heterogeneous results. The present review summarizes findings of currently available studies on gender effects on neuropsychological tests covering major cognitive domains, emotion processing as well as quality of life in patients with PD. Overall, the occurrence of cognitive impairment in PD seems to be associated with male gender, though inconsistent results were shown in cognitive screening tests. Regarding emotion recognition, men with PD were found to be less accurate than women with PD at identifying fearful expressions, whereas vice versa results appeared in healthy subjects. Lower quality of life and greater disability were reported by women compared to men with PD, which corresponds with the results in healthy subjects. Several disease-specific mediators as well as the question of a general gender and age-related effect as observed in healthy individuals are discussed. Increased knowledge on possible gender effects in PD would provide an enhanced insight in underlying pathological mechanisms, and has potential implications for the diagnosis and treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder leading to progressive motor impairment affecting more than 1% of the over-65 population. In spite of considerable progress in identifying the genetic and biochemical basis of PD, to date the diagnosis remains clinical and disease-modifying therapies continue to be elusive. A cornerstone in recent PD research is the investigation of biological markers that could help in identifying at-risk population or to track disease progression and response to therapies. Although none of these parameters has been validated for routine clinical practice yet, however some biochemical candidates hold great promise for application in PD patients, especially in the early stages of disease, and it is likely that in the future the diagnosis of PD will require a combination of genetic, imaging and laboratory data. In this review we discuss the most interesting biochemical markers for PD (including the \"-omics\" techniques), focusing on the methodological challenges in using ex vivo blood/CSF/tissue-based biomarkers and suggesting alternative strategies to overcome the difficulties that still prevent their actual use.",

    "abstract": "Falls in Parkinson's disease (PD) are common and frequently devastating. Falls prevention is an urgent priority, but there is no accepted program that specifically addresses the risk profile in PD. Therefore, we aimed to provide consensus-based clinical practice recommendations that systematically address potential fall risk factors in PD. We developed an overview of both generic (age-related) and PD-specific factors. For each factor, we specified: best method of ascertainment; disciplines that should be involved in assessment and treatment; and which interventions could be engaged. Using a web-based tool, we asked 27 clinically active professionals from multiple relevant disciplines to evaluate this overview. The revised version was subsequently reviewed by 12 experts. Risk factors and their associated interventions were included in the final set of recommendations when at least 66% of reviewing experts agreed. These recommendations included 31 risk factors. Nearly all required a multidisciplinary team approach, usually involving a neurologist and PD-nurse specialist. Finally, the expert panel proposed to first identify the specific fall type and to tailor screening and treatment accordingly. A routine evaluation of all risk factors remains reserved for high-risk patients without prior falls, or for patients with seemingly unexplained falls. In conclusion, this project produced a set of consensus-based clinical practice recommendations for the examination and management of falls in PD. These may be used in two ways: for pragmatic use in current clinical practice, pending further evidence; and as the active intervention in clinical trials, aiming to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of large scale implementation.",

    "abstract": "Patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) can provide crucial information about the involvement of the motor system and prefrontal cortex in processing idioms including action verbs, since dopamine modulates the activity of these structures, and, consequently, different levels of this neurotransmitter can induce different cognitive impairments. In order to investigate the ability to process ambiguous idioms containing an action verb in patients, we asked 15 PD patients, in both OFF- and ON-phases, and 15 healthy matched participants to judge the plausibility of literal and idiomatic sentences, each presented at a self-paced rate. Patients in OFF-phase were faster in reading idiomatic than literal sentences, supporting the view that the motor system is not involved in online idiom processing. However, patients during OFF-phase were impaired in judging the plausibility of idiomatic ambiguous sentences, possibly due to the reduction of dopamine in prefrontal regions. The involvement of the motor system was evident in the ON-phase for literal sentences, suggesting that motor activation is strictly dependent on the context.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with pathologically altered oscillatory activity. While synchronized oscillations between 13 and 30 Hz are increased within a cortico-subcortical network, cortico-muscular coupling (CMC) is decreased. The present study aims at investigating the effect of non-invasive transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) of the primary motor cortex (M1) on motor symptoms and motor-cortical oscillations in PD. In 10 PD patients and 10 healthy control subjects, static isometric contraction, dynamic fast finger tapping, and diadochokinesia of the more severely affected hand were investigated prior to and shortly after tACS of the contralateral M1 at 10 Hz vs. 20 Hz vs. sham. During isometric contraction, neuromagnetic activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography. 20 Hz tACS attenuated beta band CMC during isometric contraction and amplitude variability during finger tapping in PD patients but not in healthy control subjects. 10 Hz tACS yielded no significant after-effects. The present data suggest that PD is associated with pathophysiological alterations which abet a higher responsiveness toward frequency-specific tACS - possibly due to pathologically altered motor-cortical oscillatory synchronization at frequencies between 13 and 30 Hz.",

We evaluated the frequency of nonmotor symptoms in patients with PD and we explored the influence of disease characteristics on the presence of these symptoms.\nOne hundred sixty six patients and sixty six matched controls were enrolled in the study. The Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQuest), a 30-item self-completed questionnaire, was used for the evaluation of nonmotor symptoms.\nNon-motor symptoms were more common in PD patients than controls. Mean \u00b1 SD NMSQuest score was 6.76 \u00b1 4.22 in PD patients and 5.44 \u00b1 4.45 in controls (p=0.035). The more common non-motor symptoms in PD patients were urinary urgency (54.3%), nocturia (51.8%), constipation (45.7%) and sadness (42.1%). There was a correlation between NMSQuest score and severity of the disease.\nNon-motor symptoms in PD are too important to remain undetected.

    "abstract": "So far, the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. Current studies implicate environmental toxins may be potential causes of fetal origin of PD. BPA is a member of the family of estrogenic chemicals existing widely in environment. Significant evidences from animal experimentation have demonstrated that BPA interfere with fetal neurodevelopment. Based on previous reports and our research on EB derived from hESCs, we speculate that maternal exposure to low-dose BPA during gestational period may decrease IGF-1 expression, thus hinder the development of fetal DA neurons, and finally increase the risks of fetal origin of PD. Our hypothesis may shed new light on the pathogenesis of PD and lead to potential preventive treatments.",

We established a homogeneous population of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hAD-MSCs) from human adult patients with early-onset hereditary familial Parkin-defect PD as well as late-onset idiopathic PD by immortalizing cells with the hTERT gene to better understand the underlying mechanism of PD. The hAD-MSCs from patients with idiopathic PD were designated as \"PD\", from patients with Parkin-defect PD as \"Parkin\" and from patients with pituitary adenomas as \"non-PD\" in short. The pGRN145 plasmid containing hTERT was introduced to establish telomerase immortalized cells. The established hTERT-immortalized cell lines showed chromosomal aneuploidy sustained stably over two-years. The morphological study of mitochondria in the primary and immortalized hAD-MSCs showed that the mitochondria of the non-PD were normal; however, those of the PD and Parkin were gradually damaged. A striking decrease in mitochondrial complex I, II, and IV activities was observed in the hTERT-immortalized cells from the patients with idiopathic and Parkin-defect PD. Comparative Western blot analyses were performed to investigate the expressions of PD specific marker proteins in the hTERT-immortalized cell lines. This study suggests that the hTERT-immortalized hAD-MSC cell lines established from patients with idiopathic and familial Parkin-defect PD could be good cellular models to evaluate mitochondrial dysfunction to better understand the pathogenesis of PD and to develop early diagnostic markers and effective therapy targets for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by deposition of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether LRRK2 and \u03b1-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this review article, we will discuss the current state of knowledge in terms of how these proteins cause the disease and provide the hypothetical mechanisms by which LRRK2 might modify the generation and progression of synucleinopathy.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this study were to assess the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), to determine its correlation with disease severity, and to define a simple biomarker for predicting clinical severity. One hundred two eyes from 52 patients affected by PD were compared with 97 eyes from 50 age-comparable controls. In all patients, peripapillary RNFL thickness was measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). We used the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) total score and measured responses in the on medication state. Eyes from patients with PD had a statistically significant decrease in average peripapillary RNFL thickness compared with control eyes (P < 0.001). This reduction was observed in every quadrant (inferior, superior, nasal [P < 0.001], and temporal [P = 0.017]) in patients with PD. Furthermore, a strong inverse correlation was found between the PD severity measured according to the UPDRS score and the average peripapillary RNFL thickness (r = -0.615; P < 0.001) and PD duration (r = -0.303; P = 0.002). From these results, we defined a regression equation that predicts the UPDRS score from the above-mentioned variables: UPDRS\u2009= 81.6 + 29.6 * log PD duration (years)\u2009- 0.6 * RFNL thickness (\u03bcm). We observed that, as the evolution and severity of PD progress, the peripapillary RNFL layer thickness, as evaluated by OCT, gradually diminishes. These results suggest that the average peripapillary RNFL thickness measured by OCT might be useful as a biomarker to detect the early onset and progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "The placebo effect, or response, is a complex phenomenon whereby an inert treatment can induce a therapeutic benefit if the subject is made to believe that it is effective. One of the main mechanisms involved is represented by expectations of clinical improvement which, in turn, have been found to either reduce anxiety or activate reward mechanisms. Therefore, the study of the placebo effect allows us to understand how emotions may affect both behavior and therapeutic outcome. The high rate of placebo responders in clinical trials of Parkinson's disease provided the motivation to investigate the biological underpinnings of the placebo response in Parkinsonian patients. The placebo effect in Parkinson's disease is induced through the administration of an inert substance which the patient believes to improve motor performance. By using this approach, different behavioral and neuroimaging studies have documented objective improvements in motor performance and an increase of endogenous dopamine release in both the dorsal and ventral striatum. Recently, single-neuron recording from the subthalamic and thalamic regions during the implantation of electrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to investigate the firing pattern of different neurons before and after placebo administration. The results show that the subthalamic nucleus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata, and the ventral anterior thalamus are all involved in the placebo response in Parkinson patients, thus making intraoperative recording an excellent model to characterize the neuronal circuit that is involved in the placebo response in Parkinson's disease as well as in other disorders of movement.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. Restless legs syndrome has been shown to negatively impact the quality of life of patients. Studies have shown an association between restless legs syndrome and Parkinson's disease. We attempted to investigate the prevalence of restless legs syndrome in Parkinson's disease patients and to identify associated risk factors. Method. This was a cross-sectional study among patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Exclusion criterion was a Mini Mental State Examination score of less than 21/30. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group criterion was used to identify patients with restless legs syndrome. Results. A total of 113 patients were recruited. The prevalence rate of restless legs syndrome in our cohort was 9.7% and was significantly associated with a younger onset of Parkinson's disease (P = 0.023), male gender (P = 0.045), higher Mini Mental State Examination score (P = 0.004), and less advanced Hoehn & Yahr stage (P = 0.014). Conclusion. The prevalence rate of restless legs syndrome in our Parkinson's disease population is in keeping with other studies published worldwide. The significance of the association between a younger onset of Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome needs to be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "In advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be an alternative option for the treatment of motor symptoms. Side effects associated with subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS in patients with PD are emerging as the most frequent sensory and motor symptoms. DBS-related syncope is reported as extremely rare. We wanted to discuss the mechanisms of syncope associated with STN DBS in a patient with Parkinson's disease. Case report. Sixty-three-year-old female patient is followed up with diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease for 6 years in our clinic. The patient has undergone STN DBS due to painful dystonia and drug resistant tremor. During the operation, when the left STN was stimulated at 5 milliampere (mAmp), the patient developed presyncopal symptoms. However, when the stimulation was stopped symptoms improved. During the early period after the operation, when the right STN was stimulated at 1.3 millivolts (mV), she developed the pre-yncopal symptoms and then syncope. Our case shows that STN DBS may lead to directly autonomic symptoms resulting in syncope during stimulation-on (stim-on).",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a common finding in Parkinson's disease (PD), even in the early stages. The concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD was recently formalized with diagnosis being reached after impairments in neuropsychological tasks become significant in at least one domain. The brain profile of cognitive deficits involves executive functions (e. g., planning, set shifting, set maintenance, problem solving), attention and memory function. Memory deficits are characterized by impairments in delayed recall, temporal ordering and conditional associate learning. PD patients demonstrate relatively preserved recognition. Visuospatial dysfunctions have also been reported, while language is largely preserved. The existence of two distinct mild cognitive syndromes has also been suggested. One of these affects mainly the frontostriatal executive deficits that are modulated by dopaminergic medications and by a genetically determined level of prefrontal cortex dopamine release. The other affects the more-posterior cortical abilities, such as visuospatial and memory functions, and is suggested to be associated with an increased risk for conversion to dementia. Cross-sectional studies have commonly reported dementia in 20-30% of PD patients, although the 8-year cumulative incidence of dementia may be as high as 78%. Factors associated with dementia in PD are age at onset, age at the time of examination, akinetic-rigid form PD, depression, hallucination, rapid eye movement sleep behavioral disorder and severe olfactory deficits. Clinical features generally involve the same type of deficits as those found in MCI patients, which are more severe and more extensive. The phenomenology of the dementia syndrome is similar to that seen in dementia with Lewy bodies, and clinicopathological correlation studies have revealed varying results with regard to neurochemical deficits and the pathological substrate underlying cognitive impairment and dementia. Early cognitive impairment, particularly in the form of executive dysfunction, is indicative of mainly fronto-striatal pathologic changes and might originate during nigrostriatal and subsequent mesocortical dopamine denervation. A potential parallel noradrenergic deficit and cholinergic deficit disturbance in patients without dementia might also contribute to MCI. Extensive pathological changes in Lewy bodies lead to widespread cortical and subcortical degeneration and profound cholinergic deficits, and might lead to the development of dementia. Several studies have revealed a significant correlation between dementia and Alzheimer-type pathology.",

    "abstract": "Depression affects Parkinson's disease (PD) patient's QOL. Although it changes with the diagnostic criteria used, the frequency of depression in PD is approximately 10-30%. Anhedonia is characteristic in PD. According to research on anhedonia in PD using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), the positive ratio of anhedonia is high in PD. The SHAPS score significantly correlates with the severity of PD and duration of the disease. An examination of the literature on depression before the development of motor symptoms of PD revealed that the risk of PD is high in patients with a history of depression. Pathologically, the substantia nigra is affected in the later stages and raphe nuclei are affected in the early stages. This suggests that depression is a prodromal symptom of PD.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have a lower risk for most types of cancer except for melanoma, which has a modest positive association with PD. Pigmentation genes have been hypothesized to contribute to this association. We therefore examined whether genetic susceptibility loci for pigmentation or melanoma was associated with PD risk in 2 large independent datasets. In the Parkinson's Genes and Environment (PAGE) study, we examined 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified from previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of pigmentation or melanoma in relation to PD among 808 PD cases and 1623 controls; furthermore, we also examined the colors of hair, eye, or skin and melanoma in relation to PD. In the International Parkinson's Disease Genomic Consortium (IPDGC), we examined a broader selection of 360 pigmentation or melanoma GWAS SNPs in relation to PD among 5,333 PD cases and 12,019 controls. All participants were non-Hispanic Whites. As expected, in the PAGE study, most SNPs were associated with 1 or more pigmentation phenotypes. However, neither these SNPs nor pigmentation phenotypes were associated with PD risk after Bonferroni correction with the exception of rs4911414 at the ASIP gene (p = .001). A total of 18 PD cases (2.2%) and 26 controls (1.6%) had a diagnosis of melanoma with an odds ratio of 1.3 (95% confidence interval: 0.7-2.4). In the IPDGC analysis, none of the 360 SNPs, including rs4911414, were associated with PD risk after adjusting for multiple comparisons. In conclusion, we did not find significant associations between GWAS SNPs of pigmentation or melanoma and the risk for PD.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to investigate whether speakers with hypophonia, secondary to Parkinson's disease (PD), would increases their vocal intensity when speaking in a noisy environment (Lombard effect). The other objective was to examine the underlying laryngeal and respiratory strategies used to increase vocal intensity.\nThirty-three participants with PD were included for study. Each participant was fitted with the SpeechVive\u2122 device that played multi-talker babble noise into one ear during speech. Using acoustic, aerodynamic and respiratory kinematic techniques, the simultaneous laryngeal and respiratory mechanisms used to regulate vocal intensity were examined.\nSignificant group results showed that most speakers with PD (26/33) were successful at increasing their vocal intensity when speaking in the condition of multi-talker babble noise. They were able to support their increased vocal intensity and subglottal pressure with combined strategies from both the laryngeal and respiratory mechanisms. Individual speaker analysis indicated that the particular laryngeal and respiratory interactions differed among speakers.\nThe SpeechVive\u2122 device elicited higher vocal intensities from patients with PD. Speakers used different combinations of laryngeal and respiratory physiologic mechanisms to increase vocal intensity, thus suggesting that disease process does not uniformly affect the speech subsystems.\nReaders will be able to: (1) identify speech characteristics of people with Parkinson's disease (PD), (2) identify typical respiratory strategies for increasing sound pressure level (SPL), (3) identify typical laryngeal strategies for increasing SPL, (4) define the Lombard effect.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the fronto\u2013striatal system for implicit task sequence learning. We tested performance of patients with compromised functioning of the fronto\u2013striatal loops, that is, patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with lesions in the ventromedial or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We also tested amnesic patients with lesions either to the basal forebrain/orbitofrontal cortex or to thalamic/medio-temporal regions. We used a task sequence learning paradigm involving the presentation of a sequence of categorical binary-choice decision tasks. After several blocks of training, the sequence, hidden in the order of tasks, was replaced by a pseudo-random sequence. Learning (i.e., sensitivity to the ordering) was assessed by measuring whether this change disrupted performance. Although all the patients were able to perform the decision tasks quite easily, those with lesions to the fronto\u2013striatal loops (i.e., patients with Parkinson's disease, with lesions in the ventromedial or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and those amnesic patients with lesions to the basal forebrain/orbitofrontal cortex) did not show any evidence of implicit task sequence learning. In contrast, those amnesic patients with lesions to thalamic/medio-temporal regions showed intact sequence learning. Together, these results indicate that the integrity of the fronto\u2013striatal system is a prerequisite for implicit task sequence learning.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to investigate brain activity abnormalities in the early stage of Parkinson's disease (PD). To achieve this goal, eyes-closed resting state electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded from 15 early-stage PD patients and 15 age-matched healthy controls. The AR Burg method and the wavelet packet entropy (WPE) method were used to characterize EEG signals in different frequency bands between the groups, respectively. In the case of the AR Burg method, an increase of relative powers in the \u03b4- and \u03b8-band, and a decrease of relative powers in the \u03b1- and \u03b2-band were observed for patients compared with controls. For the WPE method, EEG signals from patients showed significant higher entropy over the global frequency domain. Furthermore, WPE in the \u03b3-band of patients was higher than that of controls, while WPE in the \u03b4-,\u00a0\u03b8-,\u00a0\u03b1- and \u03b2-band were all lower. All of these changes in EEG dynamics may represent early signs of cortical dysfunction, which have potential use as biomarkers of PD in the early stage. Our findings may be further used for early intervention and early diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system, affecting 1 in 50 people over the age of 60 years. PD is the result of loss of a majority of dopamine (DA) neurons in the midbrain substantia nigra. The basic pathological feature of PD is the formation of intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies, Lewy bodies. So far, what leads to DA neuron degeneration is uncertain. Thirteen familial PD related loci have been identified, including six mutations:\u03b1-SYN(PARK1/4), Parkin(PARK2), UCHL1(PARK5), PINK1(PARK6), DJ-1(PARK7) and LRRK2 (PARK8). Drosophila has been widely used in the study of human diseases because of its genetic advantages. The Drosophila DA synthesis is similar to human, and Drosophila DA system is also involved in motion control, so it is generally considered that DA neuron death of Drosophila can be a perfect model of PD. In this article we review the progress of research methods based on Drosophila model in study of mechanisms related to Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "VPS35 mutations have been identified as a cause of autosomal dominantly inherited Parkinson's disease (PD). VPS35 interacts with VPS26A in the retromer complex that links mitochondrial and lysosomal pathways, which have both been shown to be dysfunctional in PD. Thus, mutations in VPS26A may be associated with PD. To test this hypothesis, we screened 245 idiopathic PD patients and 185 control subjects for mutations in the retromer subunit VPS26A. We found 2 novel missense variants in patients and 2 known missense variants in control subjects. The missense variants were unlikely to be disease causing, suggesting that VPS26A mutations are not a frequent cause of PD.",

C57/BL mice were ip injected LPS (5 mg x kg(-1)) once. One week following the LPS injection, mice received a subcutaneous injection of MPTP (25 mg x kg(-1)) once daily for 2 days. Eight weeks later, FLZ (25, 50 and 75 mg x kg(-1)) was orally administered to mice once daily for 60 days. The motor ability of the mice was evaluated by rod climbing test and footprint test. The dopamine (DA) levels in mouse striatum were determined by high performance liquid chromatography system. The tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells were showed by immunohistochemical analysis. FLZ treatment significantly improved motor dysfunction of mice challenged by LPS plus MPTP. The increase of TH-positive cell numbers and elevation of DA levels may be contributed to the beneficial effects of FLZ on motor behavior. This study showed FLZ has significant therapeutic effect on LPS plus MPTP induced chronic PD model, which indicates its potential as a new candidate drug to treat PD.",

    "abstract": "The frequency of sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease has led to the suggestion that these processes might share common neural circuitry. This study aimed to identify the relationships between measures of cognitive functioning and an objective measure of sleep disturbance. Ninety-five patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and 48 healthy controls underwent neurological and neuropsychological examination. They wore an actigraphy watch for 2 weeks, from which a measure of nocturnal sleep efficiency was calculated. Multiple regression models showed that working memory and verbal memory consolidation were significantly associated with sleep efficiency, as well as education and age. By contrast, verbal fluency and attentional set-shifting were not associated with sleep efficiency, after accounting for age and education. These findings reveal that nocturnal sleep disturbance in Parkinson's disease is associated with specific cognitive difficulties, rather than a global pattern of cognitive dysfunction. This may in part reflect common neural underpinnings.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to survey the prevalence and distribution of non-motor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients in Shanghai, China, and to investigate the association between NMS and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). One hundred fifty-five PD patients were evaluated using the NMS Questionnaire 30 (NMSQuest), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39). These data were compared with an international cross-sectional study, and the associations of motor and non-motor measures with HRQoL were estimated. Predictors of HRQoL were sought through multiple linear regression analyses. Each PD patient had eight different individual NMS on average. The problems of memory (65.82%), constipation (64.56%) and nocturia (61.39%) were the most frequent complaints. NMS prevalence in PD patients in Shanghai was consistent with that in the international study, although the composition proportions were different. There was a significant association of PDQ-39 score with NMSQuest score (rs=0.433, p=0.000), UPDRS III score (rs=0.473, p=0.000), Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) stage (rs=0.567, p=0.000), disease duration (rs=0.220, p=0.005), and levodopa equivalent dosage (rs=0.263, p=0.001). H-Y stage (disease severity) and NMS score were the strongest predictors for PDQ-39 score. This study confirmed that NMS are common in PD, occurring across all disease stages and have a great impact on quality of life. NMS progression contributes significantly to HRQoL decline, and should be well recognized and treated.",

    "abstract": "To describe swallowing management in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson' disease (PD), to investigate whether physiopathology determines the choice of therapeutic approaches, and to investigate whether the disease duration modifies the therapeutic approaches.\nThis is a long-term study comprising 24 patients with idiopathic PD and 27 patients with ALS. The patients were followed-up in a dysphagia outpatient clinic between 2006 and 2011. The patients underwent clinic evaluation and Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing, Functional Oral Intake Scale, and therapeutic intervention every 3 months. The swallowing management was based on orientation about the adequate food consistency and volume, besides the necessary maneuvers or exercises to improve swallowing functionality. An exploratory analysis of data was used to investigate associations between the groups of disease (PD or ALS) and clinic aspects and to know about the association between the groups of diseases and the application of maneuver or exercises over the follow-up.\nThe most frequent recommended maneuvers in PD were bolus effect (83.3%), bolus consistency (79.2%), and swallowing frequency (79%). To patients with ALS, the bolus consistency (92%) and the bolus effect (74.1%) were more recommended. Strengthening-tongue (p=0.01), tongue control (p=0.05), and vocal exercises (p<0.001) were significantly more recommended in PD than in ALS.\nCompensatory and sensorial maneuvers are more recommended to rehabilitee program in both diseases.

Increased susceptibility of lymphocytes to apoptosis has been reported in AD. To our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the expression and phosphorylation status of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 20 AD and 20 PD patients and 20 healthy controls using western blot analysis. Compared with controls, no significant difference of total p38MAPK or JNK levels were observed in AD and PD patients, whereas phosphorylated p38MAPK and phosphorylated JNK levels were significantly increased in the AD and PD groups (p<0.001). However, the increased levels of the two phosphorylated kinases in AD versus PD patients presented no significant difference. Interestingly, phosphorylated p38MAPK and phosphorylated JNK levels were positively correlated with disease duration (r=0.602, p=0.005 and r=0.561, p=0.010, respectively) and negatively correlated with the Mini Mental State Examination score (r=-0.664, p=0.001 and r=-0.578, p=0.008, respectively) in AD patients. No correlations between protein levels and clinical variables were found in PD patients. Investigation of peripheral changes in the expression of p38MAPK and JNK may lead to the development of innovative biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly for AD.",

    "abstract": "In view of freezing of gait's circumstances of occurrence in Parkinson's disease, attentional resources appear to be involved in step initiation failure. Anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) are essential because they allow unloading of the stepping leg and so create the conditions required for progression. Our main objective was to establish whether or not a change in attentional load during step initiation modulates APAs differently in patients with vs. without freezing of gait.\nThree groups of 15 subjects were recruited: elderly people and parkinsonian patients with or without freezing of gait. Attention was modulated before step execution by means of an auditory oddball discrimination task with event-related potential recording. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of inappropriate APAs following the attentional task, i.e. APAs not followed by a step after an intercurrent auditory stimulus.\nIn parkinsonian patients with freezing of gait, inappropriate APAs were recorded in 63% of the trials and were observed more frequently than in patients without freezing of gait (51%) and elderly controls (48%). Furthermore, inappropriate APAs in freezers were longer and more ample than in parkinsonian non-freezers and controls. Lastly, postural preparation was impaired in the parkinsonian patients.\nOur results indicate that allocation of attentional resources during step preparation influences the release of APAs differently in freezers and non-freezers. Modulating attentional load is partly responsible for triggering an inappropriate motor program. This difficulty in focusing attention or resisting interference may contribute (at least in part) to the gait initiation failure observed in parkinsonian freezers.",

The detection of visual symptoms is important for differential diagnosis and patient management.\nTo establish the prevalence of recurrent visual complaints (RVC) and recurrent visual hallucinations (RVH) and to investigate their interaction in PD patients and controls.\nThis cross-sectional study included 88 PD patients and 90 controls. RVC and RVH were assessed with a visual symptom questionnaire and the North-East-Visual-Hallucinations-Interview (NEVHI).\nDouble vision (PD vs.\n18.2% vs. 1.3%; p < 0.001), misjudging objects when walking (PD vs.\n12.5% vs. 1.3%; p < 0.01), words moving whilst reading (PD vs.\n17.0% vs. 1.3%; p < 0.001) and freezing in narrow spaces (PD vs.\n30.7% vs. 0%; p < 0.001) were almost exclusively found in PD patients. The same was true for recurrent complex visual hallucinations and illusions (PD vs.\nboth 17.0% vs. 0%; p < 0.001). Multiple RVC (43.2% vs. 15.8%) and multiple RVH (29.5% vs. 5.6%) were also more common in PD patients (both p < 0.001). RVC did not predict recurrent complex visual hallucinations; but double vision (p = 0.018, R(2) = 0.302) and misjudging objects (p = 0.002, R(2) = 0.302) predicted passage hallucinations. Misjudging objects also predicted the feeling of presence (p = 0.010, R(2) = 0.321).\nMultiple and recurrent visual symptoms are common in PD. RVC emerged as risk factors predictive of the minor forms of hallucinations, but not recurrent complex visual hallucinations.",

    "abstract": "To examine the response of cerebral oxygenation during treadmill walking in a person with Parkinson disease (PD) who experiences freezing of gait (FOG) and to determine whether the oxygen response was related to the timing of his PD medication. Client Description: A 61-year-old man with PD performed two bouts of treadmill testing on the same day, during the on- and off-phases of his PD medication. Measures and Outcome: The client experienced two FOG episodes during the first testing session (on-phase with hypokinetic movement session). Cerebral oxygen response (measured by near-infrared spectroscopy) was stable until the FOG episodes occurred, at which point it decreased until the FOG episode was over. No electrocardiogram (ECG) changes or lightheadedness were noted; blood pressure (BP) remained stable. During the second exercise testing session (off-phase with dyskinetic movement session), the client did not experience any FOG episodes, and his cerebral oxygen response remained stable. Toward the end of the second testing session, he experienced lightheadedness and a drop in BP of approximately 30 mmHg, along with significant ST segment depression on his ECG.\nHaemodynamic and cerebral oxygen changes occurred that were specific to the timing of the client's PD medication and to his FOG episodes. This case study shows a person with PD demonstrating decreased cerebral oxygenation during FOG, which may be based on his variable response to levodopa medication or may be attributable to as yet unidentified physiologic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Alleles of the FMR1 gene containing small expansions of the CGG-trinucleotide repeat comprise premutation and grey-zone alleles. Premutation alleles may cause late-onset Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome attributed to the neurotoxic effect of elevated FMR1 transcripts. Our earlier data suggested that both grey-zone and low-end premutation alleles might also play a significant role in the acquisition of the parkinsonian phenotype due to mitochondrial dysfunction caused by elevated FMR1 mRNA toxicity. These data were obtained through clinical and molecular comparisons between carriers of grey-zone/low-end premutation alleles and group-matched non-carrier controls from patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD). We aimed to explore the relationship between grey-zone alleles, parkinsonism and white matter changes.\nThis study compared the extent and severity of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) on magnetic resonance imaging, using a semi-quantitative method, between 11 grey-zone/low-end premutation carriers and 20 non-carrier controls with iPD from our earlier study. Relationships between WMH scores, and cognitive and motor test scores were assessed for carriers and non-carriers.\nSupratentorial WMH scores, and tremor and ataxia motor scores were significantly higher in carriers compared with disease controls. Moreover, some associations between cognitive decline and WMH scores were specific for each respective carrier status category.\nThe results support our earlier claim that grey-zone alleles contribute to the severity of parkinsonism and white matter changes.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of inappropriate, habitual or prepotent responses is an essential component of executive control and a cornerstone of self-control. Via the hyperdirect pathway, the subthalamic nucleus (STN) receives inputs from frontal areas involved in inhibition and executive control. Evidence is reviewed from our own work and the literature suggesting that in Parkinson's disease (PD), deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN has an impact on executive control during attention-demanding tasks or in situations of conflict when habitual or prepotent responses have to be inhibited. These results support a role for the STN in an inter-related set of processes: switching from automatic to controlled processing, inhibitory and executive control, adjusting response thresholds and influencing speed-accuracy trade-offs. Such STN DBS-induced deficits in inhibitory and executive control may contribute to some of the psychiatric problems experienced by a proportion of operated cases after STN DBS surgery in PD. However, as no direct evidence for such a link is currently available, there is a need to provide direct evidence for such a link between STN DBS-induced deficits in inhibitory and executive control and post-surgical psychiatric complications experienced by operated patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder, associated with rigidity, bradykinesia, and resting tremor, among other motor symptoms. In addition, patients with PD also show cognitive and psychiatric dysfunction, including dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), depression, hallucinations, among others. Interestingly, the occurrence of these symptoms-motor, cognitive, and psychiatric-vary among individuals, such that a subgroup of PD patients might show some of the symptoms, but another subgroup does not. This has prompted neurologists and scientists to subtype PD patients depending on the severity of symptoms they show. Neural studies have also mapped different motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms in PD to different brain networks. In this review, we discuss the neural and behavioral substrates of most common subtypes of PD patients, that are related to the occurrence of: (a) resting tremor (vs. nontremor-dominant); (b) MCI; (c) dementia; (d) impulse control disorders (ICD); (e) depression; and/or (f) hallucinations. We end by discussing the relationship among subtypes of PD subgroups, and the relationship among motor, cognitive, psychiatric factors in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. An inflammatory reaction seems to be involved in the pathological process in PD. Prospective clinical studies with various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have shown that ibuprofen decreases the risk of PD. In the present study we investigated the influence of ibuprofen on dopaminergic neuron injury in the mice model of PD.\nTwelve-month-old male C57Bl mice were injected with MPTP together with various doses of ibuprofen (10, 30 or 50 mg/kg), administered 1 h before MPTP injection for 7 consecutive days. Evaluation concerned dopamine content in the striatum, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein and \u03b1-synuclein expression measured 7 and 21 days post MPTP administration (dpa).\nMPTP caused injury to dopaminergic neuron endings in the striatum: dopamine content decreased by about 0% 7 dpa and by 85% 21 dpa; TH protein expression diminished by 21% 7 dpa; \u03b1-synuclein level decreased by 10 and 26% 7 and 21 dpa, respectively. Ibuprofen administration to mice treated with MPTP significantly increased the level of dopamine in the striatum 7 and 21 dpa. It also prevented TH protein decrease and increased \u03b1-synuclein level 21 dpa.\nIbuprofen was shown to protect neurons against MPTP-induced injury in the striatum. The possible mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of ibuprofen might be associated with decreased dopamine turnover and cyclooxygenases inhibition resulting in lower reactive oxygen species formation.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies highlight the role of DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there is a paucity of studies exploring the role of blood-based DNA methylation in PD. We aimed to explore identifiable epigenetic biomarkers for PD by analyzing the methylation status of \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA) and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) in leukocytes.\nBisulfite Specific PCR-based Sequencing method was used for semi-quantitative detection of methylation status of CpG islands in SNCA and LRRK2 promoter regions. Bisulfite Specific Cloning-based Sequencing method was used for further quantitative examination of CpG-2 methylation of SNCA. mRNA level was also detected in leukocytes.\nSemi-quantitative detection showed that the methylation status of SNCA CpG-2 differed between PD patients and normal controls, while there was no difference in CpG-1 of SNCA or in LRRK2 promoter. Further quantitative analysis by clonal assay showed that the CpG-2 of SNCA was hypomethylated in PD patients compared with the normal control (5.90% versus 7.69%, P=0.034). Moreover, among the 14 CpG sites of CpG-2, the 2nd, 4th and 9th CpG sites were significantly hypomethylated in PD patients. In subgroups of PD, the methylation level decreased in the early-onset PD patients (P=0.001). RT-PCR examination showed that SNCA mRNA was increased in PD patients compared with normal control (P=0.003).\nOur results indicated that the methylation level of SNCA CpG-2, especially that of the 2nd, 4th and 9th CpG sites in leukocytes might have great potential to be a useful and informative biomarker in PD diagnosis and treatment.",

Moreover, among the 14 CpG sites of CpG-2, the 2nd, 4th and 9th CpG sites were significantly hypomethylated in PD patients. In subgroups of PD, the methylation level decreased in the early-onset PD patients (P=0.001).

    "abstract": "Of the patients having Parkinson's disease, up to third encounters some degree of impulse control problems and one out of seven suffers from true impulse control disorders such as pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and binge eating. Dopaminergic drugs used in anti-Parkinson therapy, especially dopamine agonists, increase the risk of these disorders. Impulse control disorders are associated with a relatively more active dopamine-mediated neurotransmission of the mesolimbic and mesocortical system. Discontinuation of dopamine agonist medication can thus be considered as the first line treatment of these disorders.",

    "abstract": "[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of muscle vibration applied to the lower extremities on static postural balance of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). [Subjects] Seven subjects with Parkinson's disease participated in this study. [Methods] The oscillators of vibration were attached to the muscle bellies of the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, biceps femoris, and rectus femoris on both sides of the lower extremities with adhesive tape. A vibration frequency of 60\u2005Hz was used to induce static postural reactions. Subjects' center of pressure (COP) sway and peak ground reaction force (GRF) were measured with their eyes open with and without vibration. COP sway and peak GRF (Fx, Fy, Fz) were measured using a force plate (AMTI, Newton, USA), which provides x, y and z coordinates of body movement. [Results] The area of COP sway with vibration was significantly smaller than that with no vibration, but the length of COP sway showed no difference between two conditions. Peak medial-lateral maximum force (Fy) with vibration was significantly higher than that with no vibration, but peak anterior-posterior force (Fx) and peak vertical force (Fz) showed no differences. [Conclusion] These results suggest that vibration applied to the lower extremities can help PD patients control postural balance during quiet standing.",

More than 10% of respondents could not identify an appropriate standardized measure.\nSlightly more than half of respondents regularly assessed the UL. Respondents reported widespread use of non-standardized methods to assess PD-specific impairments. Standardized measures were more frequently used to evaluate activity limitations, but despite the unique movement disorders associated with PD, the clinimetric properties of most of the tools identified have not been established in this population.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by accumulation and misfolding of \u03b1-synuclein. Although the level of \u03b1-synuclein in neurons is fundamentally linked to the onset of neurodegeneration, multiple pathways have been implicated in its degradation, and it remains unclear which are the critical ubiquitination enzymes that protect against \u03b1-synuclein accumulation in vivo. The ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 targets \u03b1-synuclein to the endosomal-lysosomal pathway in cultured cells. Here we asked whether Nedd4-mediated degradation protects against \u03b1-synuclein-induced toxicity in the Drosophila and rodent models of Parkinson's disease. We show that overexpression of Nedd4 can rescue the degenerative phenotype from ectopic expression of \u03b1-synuclein in the Drosophila eye. Overexpressed Nedd4 in the Drosophila brain prevented the \u03b1-synuclein-induced locomotor defect whereas reduction in endogenous Nedd4 by RNAi led to worsening motor function and increased loss of dopaminergic neurons. Accordingly, AAV-mediated expression of wild-type but not the catalytically inactive Nedd4 decreased the \u03b1-synuclein-induced dopaminergic cell loss in the rat substantia nigra and reduced \u03b1-synuclein accumulation. Collectively, our data in two evolutionarily distant model organisms strongly suggest that Nedd4 is a modifier of \u03b1-synuclein pathobiology and thus a potential target for neuroprotective therapies.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a Parkinson's disease (PD) risk factor. It is suggested here that certain dietary components may either contribute to or ameliorate PD risk. There is evidence, which indicates that excessive carbohydrate (glucose or fructose) catabolism is a cause of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD, one consequence is increased production of methylglyoxal (MG). However, other dietary components (carnosine and certain plant extracts) not only scavenge MG but can also influence some of the biochemical events (signal transduction, stress protein synthesis, glycation, and toxin generation) associated with PD pathology. As double blind, placebo-controlled carnosine supplementation studies have revealed beneficial outcomes in humans, it is suggested that MG scavengers such as carnosine be further explored for their therapeutic potential toward PD.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the role of rhythmic dynamics in normal and diseased brain function is an important area of research in neural electrophysiology. Identifying and tracking changes in rhythms associated with spike trains present an additional challenge, because standard approaches for continuous-valued neural recordings--such as local field potential, magnetoencephalography, and electroencephalography data--require assumptions that do not typically hold for point process data. Additionally, subtle changes in the history dependent structure of a spike train have been shown to lead to robust changes in rhythmic firing patterns. Here, we propose a point process modeling framework to characterize the rhythmic spiking dynamics in spike trains, test for statistically significant changes to those dynamics, and track the temporal evolution of such changes. We first construct a two-state point process model incorporating spiking history and develop a likelihood ratio test to detect changes in the firing structure. We then apply adaptive state-space filters and smoothers to track these changes through time. We illustrate our approach with a simulation study as well as with experimental data recorded in the subthalamic nucleus of Parkinson's patients performing an arm movement task. Our analyses show that during the arm movement task, neurons underwent a complex pattern of modulation of spiking intensity characterized initially by a release of inhibitory control at 20-40 ms after a spike, followed by a decrease in excitatory influence at 40-60 ms after a spike.",

    "abstract": "Impairment of voice and speech occurs in the majority of patients in the course of Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of the current study was to survey the changes of voice and speech performance in the individual patients over time. 80 patients with PD and 60 healthy speakers were tested and retested after at least 12 months (average time interval: 32.5 months). Participants had to read a given text which was digitally recorded as a source for the perceptual and acoustic analysis. Stage of the disease and global motor impairment were rated according to the accepted scales. As a result, abnormalities of voice and speech were already present in mildly affected patients and there were significant deteriorations of quality of voice and articulatory velocity and precision between baseline and followup examination which showed no correlation with the time interval between the visits. Summarized, voice, and speech performance were found to further deteriorate in the individual patient in the course of time although global motor impairment was widely stable which might be a hint for nondopaminergic mechanisms of progression of dysarthrophonia. Further investigations are warranted to get a better insight into the dynamics of the progression of voice and speech impairment in PD as a precondition for the development of therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "The pedunculopontine area (PPNa) including the pedunculopontine and cuneiform nuclei, belongs to the mesencephalic locomotor region. Little is known about the oscillatory mechanisms underlying the function of this region in postural and gait control. We examined the modulations of the oscillatory activity of the PPNa and cortex during stepping, a surrogate of gait, and stance in seven Parkinson's disease patients who received bilateral PPNa implantation for disabling freezing of gait (FOG). In the days following the surgery, we recorded behavioural data together with the local field potentials of the PPNa during sitting, standing and stepping-in-place, under two dopaminergic medication conditions (OFF and ON levodopa). Our results showed that OFF levodopa, all subjects had FOG during step-in-place trials, while ON levodopa, stepping was effective (mean duration of FOG decreasing from 61.7\u00b136.1% to 7.3\u00b110.1% of trial duration). ON levodopa, there was an increase in PPNa alpha (5-12 Hz) oscillatory activity and a decrease in beta (13-35 Hz) and gamma (65-90 Hz) bands activity. PPNa activity was not modulated during quiet standing and sitting. Our results confirm the role of the PPNa in the regulation of gait and suggest that, in Parkinson disease, gait difficulties could be related to an imbalance between low and higher frequencies.",

    "abstract": "Mortalin is an essential component of the molecular machinery that imports nuclear-encoded proteins into mitochondria, assists in their folding, and protects against damage upon accumulation of dysfunctional, unfolded proteins in aging mitochondria. Mortalin dysfunction associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) increases the vulnerability of cultured cells to proteolytic stress and leads to changes in mitochondrial function and morphology. To date, Drosophila melanogaster has been successfully used to investigate pathogenesis following the loss of several other PD-associated genes. We generated the first loss-of-Hsc70-5/mortalin-function Drosophila model. The reduction of Mortalin expression recapitulates some of the defects observed in the existing Drosophila PD-models, which include reduced ATP levels, abnormal wing posture, shortened life span, and reduced spontaneous locomotor and climbing ability. Dopaminergic neurons seem to be more sensitive to the loss of mortalin than other neuronal sub-types and non-neuronal tissues. The loss of synaptic mitochondria is an early pathological change that might cause later degenerative events. It precedes both behavioral abnormalities and structural changes at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of mortalin-knockdown larvae that exhibit increased mitochondrial fragmentation. Autophagy is concomitantly up-regulated, suggesting that mitochondria are degraded via mitophagy. Ex vivo data from human fibroblasts identifies increased mitophagy as an early pathological change that precedes apoptosis. Given the specificity of the observed defects, we are confident that the loss-of-mortalin model presented in this study will be useful for further dissection of the complex network of pathways that underlie the development of mitochondrial parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "Pseudoginsenoside-F11 (PF11), a component of Panax quinquefolism (American ginseng), plays a lot of beneficial effects on disorders of central nervous system. In this paper, the neuroprotective effect of PF11 on Parkinson's disease (PD) and the possible mechanism were investigated in a rat PD model. PF11 was orally administered at 3, 6, and 12\u2009mg/kg once daily for a period of 2 weeks before and 1 week after the unilateral lesion of left medial forebrain bundle (MFB) induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). The results showed that PF11 markedly improved the locomotor, motor balance, coordination, and apomorphine-induced rotations in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. The expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in substantia nigra (SN) and the content of extracellular dopamine (DA) in striatum were also significantly increased after PF11 treatment. Moreover, significant reduction in the levels of striatal extracellular hydroxyl radical ( (\u2219) OH), detected as 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid (2,3- and 2,5-DHBA), and increase in the level of striatal extracellular ascorbic acid (AA) were observed in the PF11-treated groups compared with 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Taken together, we propose that PF11 has potent anti-Parkinson property possibly through inhibiting free radical formation and stimulating endogenous antioxidant release.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanism(s) by which dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons are eroded in Parkinson's disease (PD) is critical for effective therapeutic strategies. By using the binary tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-Gal4/UAS-X RNAi Drosophila melanogaster system, we report that Dmp53, basket and drICE gene knockdown in dopaminergic neurons prolong life span (p < 0.05; log-rank test) and locomotor activity (p < 0.05; \u03c7(2) test) in D. melanogaster lines chronically exposed to (1 mM) paraquat (PQ, oxidative stress (OS) generator) compared to untreated transgenic fly lines. Likewise, knockdown flies displayed higher climbing performance than control flies. Amazingly, gallic acid (GA) significantly protected DAergic neurons, ameliorated life span, and climbing abilities in knockdown fly lines treated with PQ compared to flies treated with PQ only. Therefore, silencing specific gene(s) involved in neuronal death might constitute an excellent tool to study the response of DAergic neurons to OS stimuli. We propose that a therapy with antioxidants and selectively \"switching off\" death genes in DAergic neurons could provide a means for pre-clinical PD individuals to significantly ameliorate their disease condition.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting up to 80% of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. FLZ, a novel synthetic squamosamide derivative from a Chinese herb, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in experimental PD models. In this study, we carried out a set of in vitro and in vivo experiments to address the neuroprotective effect of FLZ and related mechanism. The results showed that FLZ significantly improved motor dysfunction and dopaminergic neuronal loss of rats injured by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). The beneficial effects of FLZ attributed to the elevation of dopaminergic neuron number, dopamine level and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity. Mechanistic study showed that FLZ protected TH activity and dopaminergic neurons through decreasing \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) expression and the interaction between \u03b1-Syn and TH. Further studies indicated the involvement of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway in the protective effect of FLZ since it showed that blocking PI3K/Akt signaling pathway prevented the expression of \u03b1-Syn and attenuated the neuroprotection of FLZ. In addition, FLZ treatment reduced the expression of RTP801, an important protein involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Taken together, these results revealed that FLZ suppressed \u03b1-Syn expression and elevated TH activity in dopaminergic neuron through activating Akt survival pathway in 6-OHDA-induced PD models. The data also provided evidence that FLZ had potent neuroprotecive effects and might become a new promising agent for PD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Platelets induce chronic inflammation which is a key step in atherosclerosis and may be involved in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). We aimed to measure the mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet count (PLC) in NDD patients. The present study was designed to investigate the platelet function by measuring MPV and PLC in NDD. A total of 182 outpatients with Alzheimer's (AD) or Parkinson's diseases (PD) were included. The control group consisted of 104 healthy subjects. Platelet count was similar between groups. MPV values of PD patients were higher than those of AD patients and controls (P < 0.001). MPV correlated negatively with Heohn and Yahr scale (HYS) score (P < 0.001). Increased MPV in patients with PD may point to a platelet dysfunction. High-grade inflammation presents with low levels of MPV as seen in PD patients with high HYS scores.",

    "abstract": "The Glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and Glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) genes have been studied extensively as potential candidate genes for the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, direct evidence from genetic association studies remains inconclusive. In order to address this issue, we performed an updated and refined meta-analysis to determine the effect of GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms on Parkinson's disease. A fixed-effect model was utilized to calculate the combined odds ratio (OR), OR of different ethnicities, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Potential publication bias was estimated. Homogeneity of the included studies was also evaluated. The pooled OR was 1.13 [95% CI (1.03, 1.24)] and 0.96 [95% CI (0.82, 1.12)] for GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms, respectively. Analysis according to different races found no association between GSTM1/GSTT1 polymorphisms and PD risks except for GSTM1 variant in Caucasians, which showed a weak correlation (OR 1.16 [95% CI (1.04, 1.29), I squared=6.2%, p=0.384]). Neither publication bias nor heterogeneity was found among the included studies. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that GSTM1 polymorphism is weakly associated with the risk of PD in Caucasians whereas GSTT1 polymorphism is not a PD risk factor.",

    "abstract": "Although autonomic dysfunction is common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), few data are available regarding its pattern and quantitative severity with increasing Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage. We conducted autonomic function tests to quantify autonomic dysfunction in PD patients and to elucidate its possible relationship with disease progression.\nWe performed autonomic function tests including Valsalva ratio, heart rate response to deep breathing, quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test, and head-up tilt test in 66 patients with PD. We compared clinical characteristics and results of autonomic function tests between stages, and correlated the proportion of abnormal patients in each test with their H&Y stage. In addition, logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the contribution of increasing H&Y stage to impairments of each domain of the autonomic nervous system.\nWe found that PD patients with higher disease stage tended to have impairments in cardiovagal and sudomotor domains of the autonomic nervous system. Cardiovagal function was the domain most influenced by disease progression. Our findings also demonstrated that the pattern of sudomotor impairment in PD was similar to that in patients with peripheral autonomic neuropathy.\nOur study demonstrates that autonomic dysfunction is not only common in early stage PD but it increases in severity with increasing disease stage. Given that the patterns of sudomotor impairments in PD are similar to those in peripheral neuropathy, our data support a previous hypothesis that pathophysiology of PD involves both the central and peripheral nervous systems.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to develop a phenotypic model recapitulating the neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a model would show loss of dopamine in the basal ganglia, appearance of Lewy bodies, and the early stages of motor dysfunction. The model was developed by subcutaneously injecting biodegradable microspheres of rotenone, a complex I inhibitor in 8-9 month old, ovariectomized Long-Evans rats. Animals were observed for changes in body weight and motor activity. At the end of 11-12 weeks animals were euthanized and the brains examined for histopathological changes. Rotenone treated animals gain weight and appear normal and healthy as compared to controls but showed modest hypokinesia around 5-6 weeks posttreatment. Animals showed loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and the appearance of putative Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress were evidenced by the appearance of activated microglia, iron precipitates, and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine a major product of DNA oxidation. The dorsal striatum, the projection site of midbrain DA neurons, showed a significant reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining, together with an increase in reactive astrocytes, an early sign of DA nerve terminal damage. Levels of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) were significantly reduced in the dorsal striatum; however, there was an unexpected increase in dopamine transporter (DAT) levels. Old, ovariectomized females treated with rotenone microspheres present with normal weight gain and good health but a modest hypokinesia. Accompanying this behavioral phenotype are a constellation of neuropathologies characteristic of PD that include loss of DA neurons, microglia activation, oxidative damage to nuclear DNA, iron deposition, and appearance of putative Lewy bodies. This phenotypic model recapitulating the neuropathology of Parkinson's disease could provide insight into early mechanisms of pathogenesis and could aid in the identification of biomarkers to identify patients in early stage, PD.",

    "abstract": "Although the exact cause of neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease is not known, evidence points to oxidative stress and the production of reactive oxygen species as the main events that occur in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the brain of parkinsonians. EGb761 is an extract of the leaves from the Ginkgo biloba tree that has been reported as an antioxidant and neuroprotective agent. The objective of this work was to perform a systematic review of the studies that analysed the effect of Ginkgo biloba extract on Parkinson's disease or Parkinsonism. This research was conducted using the following databases: Medline, PsycInfo, Cinahl, Sigle, Lilacs, Scielo, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Initially, we selected 32 articles. After a more detailed analysis, only 10 articles remained. One of the hypotheses for the positive effect of EGb761 on Parkinson's disease is the reduction or inhibition of monoamine-oxidase activity. This enzyme metabolises dopamine, inducing the formation of free radicals, which in turn damage nigrostriatal neurons. Another hypothesis is that the neuroprotective effect of EGb761 against 6-hydroxydopamine, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and MPP+ toxins. As there are few studies on the effect of EGb761 on humans, this review could contribute new data to further the discussion of this issue.",

    "abstract": "The effect of dopaminergic therapy on balance in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear, including previous studies that excluded the effect of dyskinesias or other involuntary movements on postural sway. Additionally, medication's effects may differ between fallers and non-fallers. In this study, the authors quantify the effect of dopaminergic medication on postural balance (sway) in advanced PD, with and without dyskinesias, and consider the patient's history of falls.\nIn 24 patients with advanced idiopathic PD, postural balance was measured using a strain-gage force platform. Before and after taking dopaminergic medication, the patient's postural sway was measured at 30-s intervals to determine sway length (SL) and sway area (SA). Data analysis included the presence of dyskinesias during \"ON\" medication condition and history of previous falls.\nNo significant changes occurred in SL or SA with dopaminergic treatment for fallers without dyskinesias or non-fallers with dyskinesias. However, after dopaminergic treatment, SL and SA were 37.8 and 45% lower, respectively, in non-fallers without dyskinesias (indicating better balance) and were 87.4 and 162.8% higher, respectively, in fallers with dyskinesias (indicating poorer balance). In the ON-medication condition, SL and SA were larger in patients with dyskinesias when compared with patients without dyskinesias; SL was larger in fallers than non-fallers in both groups with or without dyskinesias.\nDopaminergic medication effects on postural sway could be a predictive factor for fall risk in PD patients with and without dyskinesias: specifically, decreased sway could indicate minimal fall risk whereas no change or increased postural sway could indicate a high risk.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder in older people. The prevalence of PD varies among ethnic and geographic groups around the world. In this study, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of PD and other types of Parkinsonism in persons aged \u226540 years in the Al Kharga district of Egypt. The study was conducted on the total population of Al Kharga district (62,583 persons) between 2005 and 2009 and involved three neurology specialists and 15 female social workers undertaking a door-to-door survey. Suspected cases of Parkinsonism were subjected to meticulous clinical and neurological examination by three neurology staff members from Assiut University hospital who carried out their examinations separately. Of the total population surveyed, 15,482 persons were aged \u226540 years and 49 of these were identified as having Parkinsonism (prevalence: 316.50 per 100,000 people [95% confidence interval {CI} 240.21-404.98]). Of the 49, 33 fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for PD, giving a prevalence rate of 213.15/100,000 (95% CI 150.51-285.80) while 14 fulfilled those for vascular Parkinsonism, with a prevalence rate of 90.43/100,000 (95% CI 49.60-137.78). Postencephalitic and unspecified Parkinsonism each had a prevalence rate of 6.46/100,000. The prevalence of Parkinsonism was found to increase steadily with age, and the prevalence of all types of Parkinsonism was statistically higher in rural compared with urban communities, with no significant difference between men and women.",

    "abstract": "Chronic administration of levodopa in Parkinson's disease leads to debilitating involuntary movements, termed levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). The pathogenesis of LID is poorly understood. Previous research has shown that histamine H2 receptors are highly expressed in the input (striatum) and output (globus pallidus, substantia nigra) regions of the basal ganglia, particularly in the GABAergic striatopallidal and striatonigral pathways. Therefore, a histamine H2 receptor antagonist could be used to reduce LID. In the present work, we investigated whether ranitidine has the potential to diminish LID in rats with dyskinesia and explored the underlying mechanisms involved.\nA rat model of PD was induced by 6-hydroxydopamine. Valid PD rats were then treated with levodopa (25 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and benserazide (12.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) for 21 days to induce a rat model of LID. The acute and chronic effects of administration of ranitidine at different doses (5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg) on abnormal involuntary movements, levodopa-induced rotations, and the forelimb adjusting steps test were investigated in LID rats. The chronic effect of ranitidine (10 mg/kg) on the expression of Arc and proenkephalin was also evaluated.\nLevodopa elicited increased dyskinesia in PD rats. Acute ranitidine treatment had no effect on LID, but chronic ranitidine administration (10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg) reduced LID in rats with dyskinesia. Importantly, levodopa-induced rotations were not affected by chronic treatment with ranitidine. In addition, chronic ranitidine (10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg) significantly improved stepping of the lesioned forepaw. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that Arc and proenkephalin levels were reduced by chronic ranitidine (10 mg/kg) in dyskinetic rats.\nThese data indicate that ranitidine is a good adjunct for reducing LID in rats with dyskinesia. Inhibition of dopamine D1-mediated activation in the medium spiny neurons may account for the antidyskinetic effects of ranitidine in rats with dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "The integration of mental and neurologic services in healthcare is a global priority. The universal Social Security of Costa Rica aspires to develop national screening of neurodegenerative disorders among the elderly, as part of the non-communicable disease agenda.\nThis study assessed the feasibility of routine screening for Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) within the public healthcare system of Costa Rica.\nThe population (aged \u226565) in the catchment areas of two primary healthcare clinics was targeted for motor and cognitive screening during routine annual health check-ups. The screening followed a tiered three-step approach, with increasing specificity. Step 1 involved a two-symptom questionnaire (tremor-at-rest; balance) and a spiral drawing test for motor assessment, as well as a three-word recall and animal category fluency test for cognitive assessment. Step 2 (for those failing Step 1) was a 10-item version of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Step 3 (for those failing Step 2) was a comprehensive neurologic exam with definitive diagnosis of PD, AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), other disorders, or subjects who were healthy. Screening parameters and disease prevalence were calculated.\nOf the 401 screened subjects (80% of target population), 370 (92%), 163 (45%), and 81 (56%) failed in Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3, respectively. Thirty-three, 20, and 35 patients were diagnosed with PD, AD, and MCI, respectively (7 were PD with MCI/AD); 90% were new cases. Step 1 sensitivities of motor and cognitive assessments regarding Step 2 were both 93%, and Step 2 sensitivities regarding definitive diagnosis 100 and 96%, respectively. Specificities for Step 1 motor and cognitive tests were low (23% and 29%, respectively) and for Step 2 tests acceptable (76%, 94%). Based on international data, PD prevalence was 3.7 times higher than expected; AD prevalence was as expected.\nProposed protocol adjustments will increase test specificity and reduce administration time. A routine screening program is feasible within the public healthcare system of Costa Rica.",

    "abstract": "Many epidemiological studies have been conducted to explore the association between a single CYP2D6 gene polymorphism and Parkinson's disease (PD) susceptibility. However, the results remain controversial.\nTo clarify the effects of a single CYP2D6 gene polymorphism on the risk of PD, a meta-analysis of all available studies relating to CYP2D6*4 polymorphism and the risk of PD was conducted.\nA comprehensive literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) up to September 1, 2013 was conducted. Data were extracted by two independent authors and pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Meta-regression, Galbraith plots, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias analysis were also performed.\nTwenty-two separate comparisons consisting of 2,629 patients and 3,601 controls were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled analyses showed a significant association between CYP2D6*4G/A polymorphism and PD risk in all of the comparisons (A vs. G allele: OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.14-1.43, P = 0.001; AA vs. GG: OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.06-1.93, P = 0.018; AG vs. GG: OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.06-1.40, P = 0.006; AG+AA vs. GG: OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.10-1.44, P = 0.001; AA vs. AG+GG: OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.02-1.83, P = 0.036). In subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity, significant associations were also demonstrated in Caucasians but not in Asians. No significant association was found in subgroup analysis stratified by age of onset or disease form.\nWe concluded that the CYP2D6*4G/A polymorphism denotes an increased genetic susceptibility to PD in the overall population, especially in Caucasians. Further large and well-designed studies are needed to confirm this association.",

    "abstract": "Shared dysregulated pathways may contribute to Parkinson's disease and type 2 diabetes, chronic diseases that afflict millions of people worldwide. Despite the evidence provided by epidemiological and gene profiling studies, the molecular and functional networks implicated in both diseases, have not been fully explored. In this study, we used an integrated network approach to investigate the extent to which Parkinson's disease and type 2 diabetes are linked at the molecular level.\nUsing a random walk algorithm within the human functional linkage network we identified a molecular cluster of 478 neighboring genes closely associated with confirmed Parkinson's disease and type 2 diabetes genes. Biological and functional analysis identified the protein serine-threonine kinase activity, MAPK cascade, activation of the immune response, and insulin receptor and lipid signaling as convergent pathways. Integration of results from microarrays studies identified a blood signature comprising seven genes whose expression is dysregulated in Parkinson's disease and type 2 diabetes. Among this group of genes, is the amyloid precursor protein (APP), previously associated with neurodegeneration and insulin regulation. Quantification of RNA from whole blood of 192 samples from two independent clinical trials, the Harvard Biomarker Study (HBS) and the Prognostic Biomarker Study (PROBE), revealed that expression of APP is significantly upregulated in Parkinson's disease patients compared to healthy controls. Assessment of biomarker performance revealed that expression of APP could distinguish Parkinson's disease from healthy individuals with a diagnostic accuracy of 80% in both cohorts of patients.\nThese results provide the first evidence that Parkinson's disease and diabetes are strongly linked at the molecular level and that shared molecular networks provide an additional source for identifying highly sensitive biomarkers. Further, these results suggest for the first time that increased expression of APP in blood may modulate the neurodegenerative phenotype in type 2 diabetes patients.",

    "abstract": "To investigate clinical features, iron metabolism and neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with sleep disorders (SD).\n211 PD patients were evaluated by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a body of scales for motor symptoms and non-motor symptoms. 94 blood and 38 cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected and iron and its metabolism-relating proteins, neuroinflammatory factors were detected and analyzed.\n136 cases (64.5%) of PD patients were accompanied by SD. Factor with the highest score in PSQI was daytime dysfunction. Depression, restless leg syndrome, autonomic symptoms and fatigue contributed 68.6% of the variance of PSQI score. Transferrin level in serum and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 level in CSF decreased, and the levels of iron, transferrin, lactoferrin and prostaglandin E2 in CSF increased in PD patients with SD compared with those without SD. In CSF, prostaglandin E2 level was positively correlated with the levels of transferrin and lactoferrin, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 level was negatively correlated with the levels of iron, transferrin and lactoferrin in CSF.\nDepression, restless leg syndrome, autonomic disorders and fatigue are the important contributors for the poor sleep in PD patients. Abnormal iron metabolism may cause excessive iron deposition in brain and be related to SD in PD patients through dual potential mechanisms, including neuroinflammation by activating microglia and neurotoxicity by targeting neurons. Hence, inhibition of iron deposition-related neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity may cast a new light for drug development for SD in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterised by excessive subcortical beta oscillations. However, little is known about the functional connectivity of the two basal ganglia across hemispheres and specifically the role beta plays in this. We recorded local field potentials from the subthalamic nucleus bilaterally in 23 subjects with Parkinson's disease at rest, on and off medication. We found suppression of low beta power in response to levodopa (t22 = -4.4, p<0.001). There was significant coherence between the two sides in the beta range in 19 of the subjects. Coherence was selectively attenuated in the low beta range following levodopa (t22 = -2.7; p = 0.01). We also separately analysed amplitude co-modulation and phase synchronisation in the beta band and found significant amplitude co-modulation and phase locking values in 17 and 16 subjects respectively, off medication. There was a dissociable effect of levodopa on these measures, with a significant suppression only in low beta phase locking value (t22\u200a=\u200a-2.8, p = 0.01) and not amplitude co-modulation. The absolute mean values of amplitude co-modulation (0.40 \u00b1 0.03) and phase synchronisation (0.29 \u00b1 0.02) off medication were, however, relatively low, suggesting that the two basal ganglia networks may have to be approached separately with independent sensing and stimulation during adaptive deep brain stimulation. In addition, our findings highlight the functional distinction between the lower and upper beta frequency ranges and between amplitude co-modulation and phase synchronization across subthalamic nuclei.",

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is known to involve altered patterns of neuronal firing and synchronization in cortical-basal ganglia circuits. One window into the nature of the aberrant temporal dynamics in the cerebral cortex of PD patients can come from analysis of the patients electroencephalography (EEG). Rather than using spectral-based methods, we used data models based on delay differential equations (DDE) as non-linear time-domain classification tools to analyze EEG recordings from PD patients on and off dopaminergic therapy and healthy individuals. Two sets of 50 1-s segments of 64-channel EEG activity were recorded from nine PD patients on and off medication and nine age-matched controls. The 64 EEG channels were grouped into 10 clusters covering frontal, central, parietal, and occipital brain regions for analysis. DDE models were fitted to individual trials, and model coefficients and error were used as features for classification. The best models were selected using repeated random sub-sampling validation and classification performance was measured using the area under the ROC curve A'. In a companion paper, we show that DDEs can uncover hidden dynamical structure from short segments of simulated time series of known dynamical systems in high noise regimes. Using the same method for finding the best models, we found here that even short segments of EEG data in PD patients and controls contained dynamical structure, and moreover, that PD patients exhibited a greater dynamic range than controls. DDE model output on the means from one set of 50 trials provided nearly complete separation of PD patients off medication from controls: across brain regions, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves, A', varied from 0.95 to 1.0. For distinguishing PD patients on vs. off medication, classification performance A' ranged from 0.86 to 1.0 across brain regions. Moreover, the generalizability of the model to the second set of 50 trials was excellent, with A' ranging from 0.81 to 0.94 across brain regions for controls vs. PD off medication, and from 0.62 to 0.82 for PD on medication vs. off. Finally, model features significantly predicted individual patients' motor severity, as assessed with standard clinical rating scales.",

    "abstract": "Discrimination learning deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been well-established. Using both behavioral patient studies and computational approaches, these deficits have typically been attributed to dopamine imbalance across the basal ganglia. However, this explanation of impaired learning in PD does not account for the possible contribution of other pathological changes that occur in the disease process, importantly including gray matter loss. To address this gap in the literature, the current study explored the relationship between fronto-striatal gray matter atrophy and learning in PD. We employed a discrimination learning task and computational modeling in order to assess learning rates in non-demented PD patients. Behaviorally, we confirmed that learning rates were reduced in patients relative to controls. Furthermore, voxel-based morphometry imaging analysis demonstrated that this learning impairment was directly related to gray matter loss in discrete fronto-striatal regions (specifically, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus and nucleus accumbens). These findings suggest that dopaminergic imbalance may not be the sole determinant of discrimination learning deficits in PD, and highlight the importance of factoring in the broader pathological changes when constructing models of learning in PD.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that expression of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK6) and \u03b2-arrestin1 in the striatum is closely associated with hyperactive dopamine receptors in rats with levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Our research group has shown that Tianqi antitremor granules have a significant effect on the motor complications of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, whether Tianqi antitremor granules have an effect on the behavioral manifestations and expression of GRK6 and \u03b2-arrestin1 in rats with LID is unknown.\nRats with PD received twice daily intraperitoneal injections of levodopa for 4 weeks to induce dyskinesia. Rats with LID were randomly divided into five groups: an LID-control group, an LID group, a levodopa plus Tianqi antitremor granules as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)-low group, a levodopa plus TCM-medium group, and levodopa plus TCM-high group. Peak intensity of rotations was measured. GRK6 and \u03b2-arrestin1 expression in the striatum of the dyskinetic rats was observed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting.\nPulsatile treatment with levodopa induced abnormal involuntary movements in rats with PD similar to LID in patients with PD. We found that repeated levodopa administration increased peak rotations in dyskinetic rats. However, peak rotations were decreased in rats given levodopa plus the different doses of Tianqi antitremor granules. In accordance with changed behavior, GRK6 and \u03b2-arrestin1 expression was decreased in rats with PD and was persistently low in rats with LID, but this decrease was prevented by coadministration of levodopa and Tianqi antitremor granules.\nTianqi antitremor granules ameliorated levodopa-induced dyskinetic behavior, reversed the decrease in GRK6 and \u03b2-arrestin1 expression, and acted as a useful adjunctive medicine for the treatment of LID.",

    "abstract": "Despite several years of research, the aetiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is quite far from being solved. In PD, as well as in other neurodegenerative disorders, it has been proposed that the combination of multiple factors might contribute to the onset of the disease. Indeed, several authors have suggested that environmental factors, such as pollutants and chemicals, might be associated with the onset of several neurodegenerative disorders. On the other hand, several studies have described that the nociceptin/orphanin-NOP and prodynorphin-KOP opioid systems are implicated in the pathology of Parkinson's disease. Considering the nonrestricted commercial availability and common use of several pesticides, such as paraquat and maneb, in agriculture of less developed countries, the aim of our study was to investigate the involvement of nociceptin/orphanin-NOP and prodynorphin-KOP systems in a chronic paraquat and maneb animal model of Parkinson's disease. Our results showed that after paraquat/maneb (5/15 mg kg(-1) ) treatment, a significant reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels, the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis, was observed. Also, the association of paraquat and maneb (5/15 mg kg(-1) ) induced an increase in nociceptin/orphanin and a decrease of prodynorphin gene expression levels in the substantia nigra with a down-regulation of NOP and KOP receptors after both treatments in the substantia nigra and caudate putamen. These data further confirm that paraquat and maneb toxicity can modulate gene expression of the nociceptin/orphanin-NOP receptor and prodynorphin-KOP receptor systems in the substantia nigra and caudate putamen, offering further support to the hypothesis that chronic exposure to these agrochemicals might be implicated in the mechanisms underlying sporadic Parkinson's disease. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder for which environmental factors influence disease risk and may act via an epigenetic mechanism. The microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) is a susceptibility gene for idiopathic PD. Methylation levels were determined by pyrosequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA in a leukocyte cohort (358 PD patients and 1084 controls) and in two brain cohorts (Brain1, comprising 69 cerebellum controls; and Brain2, comprising 3 brain regions from 28 PD patients and 12 controls). In vitro assays involved the transfection of methylated promoter-luciferase constructs or treatment with an exogenous micronutrient. In normal leukocytes, the MAPT H1/H2 diplotype and sex were predictors of MAPT methylation. Haplotype-specific pyrosequencing confirmed that the H1 haplotype had higher methylation than the H2 haplotype in normal leukocytes and brain tissues. MAPT methylation was negatively associated with MAPT expression in the Brain1 cohort and in transfected cells. Methylation levels differed between three normal brain regions (Brain2 cohort, putamen\u2009<\u2009cerebellum\u2009<\u2009anterior cingulate cortex). In PD samples, age at onset was positively associated with MAPT methylation in leukocytes. Moreover, there was hypermethylation in the cerebellum and hypomethylation in the putamen of PD patients compared with controls (Brain2 cohort). Finally, leukocyte methylation status was positively associated with blood vitamin E levels, and the effect was more significant in H2 haplotype carriers; this result was confirmed in cells that were exposed to 100 \u03bcM vitamin E. The significant effects of sex, diplotype, and brain region suggest that hypermethylation of the MAPT gene is neuroprotective by reducing MAPT expression. The effect of vitamin E on MAPT represents a possible gene-environment interaction.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (lrrk2) gene are the leading genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). In characterizing the novel ROC domain mutant A1442P, we compared its steady-state protein levels, propensity to aggregate, and toxicity with the pathogenic R1441C mutant and wild-type (WT) LRRK2. Mutant (R1441C and A1442P) and WT LRRK2 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and FLAG were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells using plasmid constructs. Western analysis and fluorescence microscopy consistently demonstrated lower mutant LRRK2 protein levels compared with WT. A time-course expression study using flow cytometry showed that WT LRRK2 expression increased initially but then plateaued by 72 hr. Conversely, R1441C and A1442P mutant expression attained 85% and 74% of WT levels at 24 hr but fell to 68% and 55% of WT levels by 72 hr, respectively. We found that proteasome inhibition markedly increased mutant LRRK2 to levels approaching those of WT. Taken together, our findings reveal increased intracellular degradation for both mutants. Furthermore, the impact of mutant and WT LRRK2 expression on HEK293 cell viability was assessed under normative and oxidative (hydrogen peroxide) conditions and found not to differ. Expression of WT and mutant LRRK2 protein gave rise to intracellular aggregates of similar appearance and cellular localization. In summary, we provide evidence that the novel A1442P mutant and the previously investigated R1441C pathogenic mutant exhibit increased intracellular degradation, a property reportedly demonstrated for the pathogenic LRRK2 kinase domain mutant I2020T.",

All patients underwent the breath test and a gastrointestinal questionnaire before and after 3 months of administration of NZT at 300 mg/day. Statistical analysis was performed by Student t test.\nNZT was well tolerated by all patients and none had abdominal pain or other adverse effects. NZT significantly shortened Tmax ((13) C) (the peak time of the (13) C-dose-excess curve) (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nAlthough this is a pilot study, we found a significant shortening of gastric emptying time after administration of NZT in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "PARKIN-related disease remains incompletely understood. First, the pathogenicity of heterozygous PARKIN mutations is unclear, although some evidence supports causality. Second, unlike sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy bodies are present only in a minority of cases. Only one other heterozygote PARKIN carrier with autopsy findings has been described. Our case adds to the broadening pathological and clinical phenotype of PARKIN-related disease.\nClinical chart, genetic analysis, and pathological findings of a patient with familial PD are reviewed.\nA 44-year-old man developed slowly progressive tremor-predominant PD with excellent response to levodopa. Genetic analysis revealed a heterozygous PARKIN exon 3-4 deletion, also present in 2 family members with early-onset PD. Postmortem examination showed severe neuronal loss in the substantia nigra and nucleus coeruleus with the presence of diffuse Lewy bodies.\nThe deletion is unlikely an incidental finding considering family history, age at onset, and the presence of clinical and pathological features not typical of sporadic PD.",

    "abstract": "An accurate early diagnostic test for Parkinson's disease (PD) is a critical unmet need. Recently, independent groups using different histological techniques have reported that the presence of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) in colonic biopsy tissue is able to distinguish living patients with PD from those without the disease. In addition, a further study has suggested that the presence of \u03b1-syn in colonic biopsy tissue may be evident in early or even prodromal PD. However, several questions remain regarding the translation of these findings into using the assessment of \u03b1-syn deposition in the enteric nervous system as a diagnostic biomarker for prodromal PD. Here we address critical issues related to the location and quantification of enteric \u03b1-syn, detection of \u03b1-syn with currently available histological techniques, timing of detection of \u03b1-syn deposition, and, most crucially, whether enteric \u03b1-syn can distinguish those with PD from both healthy individuals and individuals with other related diseases. We conclude that, although enteric \u03b1-syn is a very exciting prospect, further studies will be vital to determine whether enteric \u03b1-syn deposition has the potential to be the biomarker for prodromal PD that the field so desperately seeks.",

    "abstract": "A previous randomized, controlled trial of tai chi showed improvements in objectively measured balance and other motor-related outcomes in patients with Parkinson's disease. This study evaluated whether patient-reported outcomes could be improved through exercise interventions and whether improvements were associated with clinical outcomes and exercise adherence. In a secondary analysis of the tai chi trial, patient-reported and clinical outcomes and exercise adherence measures were compared between tai chi and resistance training and between tai chi and stretching exercise. Patient-reported outcome measures were perceptions of health-related benefits resulting from participation, assessed by the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8) and Vitality Plus Scale (VPS). Clinical outcome measures included motor symptoms, assessed by a modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-Motor Examination (UPDRS-ME) and a 50-foot speed walk. Information on continuing exercise after the structured interventions were terminated was obtained at a 3-month postintervention follow-up. Tai chi participants reported significantly better improvement in the PDQ-8 (-5.77 points, P\u2009=\u20090.014) than did resistance training participants and in PDQ-8 (-9.56 points, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and VPS (2.80 points, P\u2009=\u20090.003) than did stretching participants. For tai chi, patient-reported improvement in the PDQ-8 and VPS was significantly correlated with their clinical outcomes of UPDRS-ME and a 50-foot walk, but these correlations were not statistically different from those shown for resistance training or stretching. However, patient-reported outcomes from tai chi training were associated with greater probability of continued exercise behavior than were either clinical outcomes or patient-reported outcomes from resistance training or stretching. Tai chi improved patient-reported perceptions of health-related benefits, which were found to be associated with a greater probability of exercise adherence. The findings indicate the potential of patient perceptions to drive exercise behavior after structured exercise programs are completed and the value of strengthening such perceptions in any behavioral intervention.",

    "abstract": "Although fatigue is a common non-motor symptom in patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD), its association with motor and other non-motor symptoms is still largely unclear. We assessed fatigue in PD patients studying the possible association with motor and non-motor symptoms. Eighty-one PD patients were included in the study. The PD Fatigue Scale (PFS) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) scale were used to measure fatigue. Non-motor symptoms were assessed with the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). Motor impairment was assessed using the modified Hoehn and Yahr (HY) staging and the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) part-III and IV. Bivariate tests comparing all independent variables between patients with our without fatigue were used. Significant predictors of presence and severity of fatigue were determined with different models of logistic regression analyses. Fatigue severity was significantly higher in female patients. Bivariate test showed significant higher NMSS score in fatigued patients according to PFS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.00001) and FFS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), while HY was higher only in fatigued patients according to FSS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.022). Significant correlations between severity of fatigue and HY stage (p\u00a0<\u00a00.002) and UPDRS-III score (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were found, while, among specific non-motor symptoms, anhedonia presented with the most significant correlation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.003). Binary logistic regression confirmed NMSS as the main variable predicting presence of fatigue, while HY was significant as predicting variable only in the FSS model. Strongest non-motor symptoms predictors of severity were those included in Domain 3 (mood/anxiety) and Domain 2 (sleep disorders) of the NMSS. A significant increase in severity of fatigue related to the burden of non-motor symptoms (mainly affective and sleep disorders) was observed. Our findings indicate a moderate discrepancy in the ratings of the two fatigue scales, with PFS principally directed towards the burden of non-motor symptoms. Finally, the accurate individuation of the factors underlying fatigue, assessed with the systematic administration of holistic evaluation scales such as the NMSS, might improve current strategies used in the treatment of this disabling condition.",

    "abstract": "Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a potent mediator of cell survival and differentiation and can reverse neuronal injury associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (trkB) is the high affinity receptor for BDNF. There are two major trkB isoforms, the full-length receptor (trkB.tk(+)) and the truncated receptor (trkB.t1), that mediate the diverse, region specific functions of BDNF. Both trkB isoforms are widely distributed throughout the brain, but the isoform specific distribution of trkB.t1 and trkB.tk(+) to human neurons is not well characterized. Therefore, we report the regional and neuronal distribution of trkB.tk(+) and trkB.t1 in the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of human autopsy tissues from control and PD cases. In both PD and control tissues, we found abundant, punctate distribution of trkB.tk(+) and trkB.t1 proteins in striatum and SNpc neurons. In PD, trkB.tk(+) is decreased in striatal neurites, increased in striatal somata, decreased in SNpc somata and dendrites, and increased in SNpc axons. TrkB.t1 is increased in striatal somata, decreased in striatal axons, and increased in SNpc distal dendrites. We believe changes in trkB isoform distribution and expression levels may be markers of pathology and affect the neuronal response to BDNF.",

    "abstract": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a method to estimate the relation between data points. We used PCA to analyse movements of the upper and lower extremities during treadmill walking in healthy subjects and two groups of Parkinsonian patients. Healthy subjects (n=35) showed a typical pattern with high values of PC1 and low values in a descending order of PC2-PC4. Increase of speed resulted in a significant increase of PC1 and a significant decrease of the following PC's. In more severely affected patients (n=19, UPDRS>20), PC1 was significantly decreased and PC2-PC4 were significantly increased compared to healthy subjects. Speed could be increased only within a small range without corresponding changes of the PC's. In less severely affected patients (n=17), significant differences of the PC's were only found with fast pace. Separate analysis of arms and legs revealed that these changes are only due to altered movements of the arm. Analysis of the pattern of PC's in response to changes of gait velocities reveal alterations even in less severely affected Parkinsonian patients. The changes of the PC's with higher gait velocities in healthy subjects are suggestive of an increase of intersegmental coordination. This is impaired even in less severely affected Parkinsonian patients.",

    "abstract": "Bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease improves limb function. Unpublished observations from our clinic noted that some subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation patients complain of post-operative dyspnea. Therefore, we designed a prospective, longitudinal study to characterize this in greater depth. We used specific questionnaires to assess dyspnea in patients with electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus (n=13) or ventral intermediate thalamus (n=7). St. George's Hospital Respiratory Questionnaire symptom subscale scores were greater in subthalamic nucleus patients (median=18.60, interquartile range=40.80) than ventral intermediate thalamus patients (median = 0.00, interquartile range=15.38) at greater than 6 months post-operatively (p<0.05). Several of the subthalamic nucleus patients exhibited functional impairments as judged by the St. George's Hospital Respiratory Questionnaire impact subscale, the Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale, and the Dyspnoea-12 Questionnaire. There was no correlation between limb function ratings, stimulation parameters, or precise electrode position and dyspnea severity. We have shown, for the first time, that dyspnea can be a side effect of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation, and that this dyspnea may be highly disabling.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies identified PARK16 variants rs823128 and rs947211, PARK17/GAK rs11248051 and PARK18/HLA-DRA rs3129882 as risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). However the susceptibility of these loci to predisposing individuals for PD, particularly rs11248051, remains under investigation in Chinese populations. A total of 323 PD patients and 345 age and sex matched controls were recruited in eastern China. Our results show that minor allele frequencies of rs11248051 (odds ratio [OR] 1.522; p=0.016) and rs3129882 (OR 1.294; p=0.03), but not rs823128 and rs947211, were associated with risk for PD. Genetic interaction analysis revealed that subjects simultaneously carrying the T allele (TC or TT) of rs11248051 and the A allele (AG or AA) of rs3129882 had an aggravated risk (OR 1.91; p=0.016) of PD. However, rs11248051 or rs3129882 displayed no association with PD phenotypes or clinical scores. Our results suggest that rs11248051 and rs3129882 are risk factors for sporadic PD in a Chinese population, and their genetic interplay contributes to an elevated risk for PD predisposition. Our data provide a novel insight and further information regarding PARK16-18 loci in PD susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Hallucinations are a frequent and severe complication in Parkinson's disease (PD). Minor hallucinations are generally not disturbing, but likely progress to well-structured hallucinations with loss of insight and a great impact on quality of life. Knowledge on the neural bases of minor hallucinations may help to describe those systems associated with the early development of psychotic phenomena in PD. In this study, we aimed to identify the pattern of structural brain alterations associated with minor hallucinations in PD by using voxel-based morphometry (VBM).\nWe prospectively collected a sample of 46 non-demented PD patients, with (N = 17) and without (n = 29) minor hallucinations (passage and/or presence hallucinations), and 15 healthy controls. Groups were matched for age, education and global cognitive function. Presence and type of minor psychotic phenomena was assessed by the new MDS-UPDRS. Three dimensional T1-weighted MRI images were acquired with a 1.5 T magnet, and analyzed using optimized VBM.\nCompared to controls, PD with minor hallucinations (PD-mH) showed reduced gray matter volume bilaterally in different areas of the dorsal visual stream, and in functionally related midbrain and cerebellar structures. Additionally, bilateral gray matter volume increases were observed in the PD-mH group in limbic and paralimbic regions.\nOur data support a major role of the dorsal visual stream in the genesis of minor hallucinations in PD, reinforcing the importance of posterior cortical regions for the development of cognitive and psychiatric complications in PD.",

    "abstract": "Anhedonia is present in Parkinson's Disease (PD) as well as in addictive behaviors. Pathological Gambling (PG) and other Impulse Control Disorders (ICDs) have emerged as iatrogenic complications associated with dopamine replacement therapy. We studied 154 PD patients, divided into three groups: 11 with PG, 23 with other ICDs (compulsive buying, hypersexuality, binge eating), 120 without ICDs. All patients underwent a thorough clinical, neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluation. The PG-group, compared to the ICDs-group and PD-controls, reported a significantly higher incidence of anhedonia (45% vs. 9% vs. 14% respectively), higher Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) scores (2.0\u00b11.3 vs. 1.0\u00b11.1 vs. 1.0\u00b11.2), higher levels of impulsivity traits as measured by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (70.0\u00b110.6 vs. 64.8\u00b111 vs. 60.9\u00b19.3) and more severe frontal dysfunctions (Frontal Assessment Battery, FAB: 12.4\u00b14.9 vs. 15.5\u00b11.6 vs. 14.4\u00b13). A model for PG (incorporating anhedonia, impulsivity levels and frontal impairment) is discussed in the context of the pathophysiology of addictive behaviors. The impairment of hedonic capacity, possibly resulting from an underlying neuropsychological dysfunction, might facilitate loss of control over reward-related behavior, thus favoring the shift towards predominantly habit-based compulsive behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) neurotoxic lesion of the midbrain dopamine (DA) system is one of the most widely used techniques for modelling Parkinson's disease in rodents. The majority of studies using this approach, however, largely limit their analysis to lesioning acutely, and looking at behavioural deficits and the number of surviving tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-stained cells in the midbrain. Here we have analysed additional characteristics that occur following intrastriatal delivery of 6-OHDA, providing better understanding of the neurodegenerative process. Female C57/Black mice were given lesions at 10 weeks old, and killed at several different time points postoperatively (3 and 6 h, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 days). While the detrimental effect of the toxin on the TH+ fibres in the striatum was immediate, we found that the loss of TH+ dendritic fibres, reduction in cell size and intensity of TH expression, and eventual reduction in the number of TH+ neurons in the substantia nigra was delayed for several days post-surgery. We also investigated the expression of various transcription factors and proteins expressed by midbrain DA neurons following lesioning, and observed changes in the expression of Aldh1a1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A1) as the neurodegenerative process evolved. Extracellularly, we looked at microglia and astrocytes in reaction to the 6-OHDA striatal lesion, and found a delay in their response and proliferation in the substantia nigra. In summary, this work highlights aspects of the neurodegenerative process in the 6-OHDA mouse model that can be applied to future studies looking at therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the impact of manifest accessory pathway on left ventricle (LV) twist physiology in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) patients. Although this issue was addressed in 1 study based on speckle tracking method, there was no comparative study with a different technique. We planned to use velocity vector imaging (VVI) to find out how much an accessory pathway can affect LV twist mechanics.\nThirty patients were enrolled regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two serial comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography evaluations were performed before and after radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) within 24 hours. Stored cine loops were analyzed using VVI technique and LV twist and related parameters were extracted.\nComparing pre- and post-RFCA data, no significant changes were observed in LV systolic and diastolic dimensions, LV ejection fraction (LVEF), and Doppler and tissue Doppler-related parameters. VVI study revealed remarkable rise in peak LV apical rotation (10.3\u00ba \u00b1 3.0\u00ba to 13.8\u00ba \u00b1 3.6\u00ba, P < 0.001) and basal rotation (-6.0 \u00b1 1.8\u00ba to -7.7 \u00b1 1.8\u00ba, P < 0.001) after RFCA. Subsequently LV twist showed a surge from 14.7\u00ba \u00b1 3.9\u00ba to 20.2\u00ba \u00b1 4.4\u00ba (P < 0.001). LV untwisting rate changed significantly from -96 \u00b1 67 to -149.0 \u00b1 47.5\u00b0/sec (P < 0.001) and apical-basal rotation delay showed a remarkable decline after RFCA (106 \u00b1 81 vs. 42.8 \u00b1 26.0 msec, P < 0.001).\nAccessory pathways have a major impact on LV twist mechanics.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal autophagy may contribute to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is largely unknown how autophagy is dysregulated by oxidative stress (OS), one of major pathogenic causes of PD. We recently discovered the potential autophagy regulator gene family including Tnfaip8/Oxi-\u03b1, which is an mTOR activator downregulated by OS in dopaminergic neurons (Choi et\u00a0al., 2010). Here we demonstrate that the OS-induced Tnfaip8l1/Oxi-\u03b2 could increase autophagy by a unique mechanism that increases the stability of TSC2, a critical negative regulator of mTOR. Tnfaip8l1/Oxi-\u03b2 and Tnfaip8/Oxi-\u03b1 are the novel regulators of mTOR acting in opposition in DA neurons. Specifically, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treatment upregulated Tnfaip8l1/Oxi-\u03b2 in DA neurons, thus inducing autophagy, while knockdown of Tnfaip8l1/Oxi-\u03b2 prevented significantly activation of autophagic markers by 6-OHDA. FBXW5 was identified as a novel binding protein for Tnfaip8l1/Oxi-\u03b2. FBXW5 is a TSC2 binding receptor within CUL4 E3 ligase complex, and it promotes proteasomal degradation of TSC2. Thus, Tnfaip8l1/Oxi-\u03b2 competes with TSC2 to bind FBXW5, increasing TSC2 stability by preventing its ubiquitination. Our data show that the OS-induced Tnfaip8l1/Oxi-\u03b2 stabilizes TSC2 protein, decreases mTOR phosphorylation and enhances autophagy. Therefore, altered regulation of Tnfaip8l1/Oxi-\u03b2 may contribute significantly to dysregulated autophagy observed in dopaminergic neurons under pathogenic OS condition.

    "abstract": "The AMANDYSK trial was designed to assess long-term efficacy of chronic treatment with amantadine in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID).\nThis was a 3-month, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, wash-out study conducted in 57 amantadine-treated (\u2265200 mg/d for \u22656 months) dyskinetic patients with PD. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in a Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) dyskinesia subscore (items 32 [duration] + 33 [severity]). Secondary outcomes included other LID measurements (\"responders\" analysis, premature dropout for LID, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale). Exploratory outcomes included time with troublesome dyskinesia as measured by diaries, UPDRS Motor Examination (part III) for motor symptoms of PD, and fatigue and apathy scores for nonmotor symptoms.\nUPDRS items 32 + 33 deteriorated more in patients switched to placebo (\"discontinuing\" group) (+1.7 \u00b1 2.0 units; 95% confidence interval 0.9, 2.4) as compared with those maintained on amantadine (\"continuing\" group) (+0.2 \u00b1 1.5 units; 95% confidence interval -0.4, 0.8; p = 0.003). Secondary outcomes confirmed this difference because there were significantly more responders, more dropouts for LID, greater increase in \"ON\" time with troublesome dyskinesia, and greater worsening of Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale score in the discontinuing group. There were no between-group differences in the UPDRS Motor Examination, whereas apathy (as measured by caregivers) and fatigue scores tended to worsen more in patients randomized to placebo.\nWash-out of amantadine in dyskinetic patients with PD significantly worsened LID. No significant effect was observed on motor parkinsonian symptoms, while exploratory outcomes suggested that amantadine might improve apathy and fatigue in such patients.\nThis article provides Class II evidence that in patients with PD, withdrawing amantadine significantly aggravates LID in a median time of 7 days.",

    "abstract": "Models of action selection postulate the critical involvement of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), especially in reactive inhibition processes when inappropriate responses to a sudden stimulus must be overridden. The STN could also play a key role during proactive inhibition, when subjects prepare to potentially suppress their actions. Here, we hypothesized that STN responses to reactive and proactive inhibitory control might be driven by different underlying mechanisms with specific temporal profiles. Direct neural recordings in twelve Parkinson's disease patients during a modified stop signal task (SST) revealed a decrease of beta band activity (\u03b2A, 13-35Hz) in the STN during reactive inhibition of smaller amplitude and shorter duration than during motor execution. Crucially, the onset latency of this relative increase of \u03b2A took place before the stop signal reaction time. It could thus be thought of as a \"stop\" signal inhibiting thalamo-cortical activity that would have supported motor execution. Finally, results also revealed a higher level of \u03b2A in the STN during proactive inhibition, which correlated with patient's inhibitory performances. We propose that \u03b2A in the STN would here participate in the implementation of a \"hold your horse\" signal to delay motor responses, thus prioritizing accuracy as compared to speed. In brief, our results provide strong electrophysiological support for the hypothesized role of the STN during executive control underlying proactive and reactive response suppression.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by bradykinesia, tremor and/ or rigidity, often with gait disturbance and postural instability. In addition to these typical features, patients with PD may experience further problems related to the disease itself or to the medications used to treat it. These comorbid problems include neuropsychiatric conditions (including psychosis, hallucinations, excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, depression, fatigue and dementia) as well as problems associated with autonomic nervous system function such as bowel and bladder function. PD can also present in emergency situations with a 'neuroleptic malignant like picture' and acute psychosis. It is not uncommon to see motor fluctuations due to drug interactions and 'withdrawal' symptoms following dose reduction of dopamine agonists. In patients with PD, disturbances of mental state constitute some of the most difficult treatment challenges of advanced disease, often limiting effective treatment of motor symptoms and leading to increased disability and poor quality of life. While some of these symptoms may be alleviated by antiparkinsonian medication, especially if they are 'off-period' related, treatment-related phenomena are usually exacerbated by increasing the number or dosage of antiparkinsonian drugs. Elimination of exacerbating factors and simplification of drug regimens are the first and most important steps in improvement of such symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Blood pressure (BP) abnormalities have been known in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The present study aimed at determining how the BPs of PD patients fluctuate in a day.\nA total of 37 PD patients and 44 OD (other disease) patients, all of who were inpatients, were monitored every 30 min by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).\nThe average systolic BP and the number of patients who showed postprandial hypotension were not different between the two groups. However, occurrence of nocturnal hypertension, BP fluctuation of over 100 mmHg in a day and BP of over 200 mmHg were significantly more frequently observed in the PD patients than in the OD patients. In the PD patients, these parameters were not different between those who were suffering from the disease for less than 10 years and those with the disease for 10 years or longer, as well as between those who had a Hoehn-Yahr staging scale of 2-3 and those with a scale of 4-5.\nTwenty-four-hour ABPM, not BP measurement once a day, enables us to determine the actual BP in PD patients. Although hypotension is a severe risk factor for falling and syncope, we emphasize the importance of monitoring rather hypertension and fluctuating BP in PD patients that may lead to a variety of other undesirable conditions. Management of hypotension, hypertension, and BP fluctuation is an important issue in the future.",

Consenting individuals underwent structural MRI, lumbar puncture, and genotyping for common variants of COMT, MAPT, SNCA, BuChE, EGF, and APOE. PD-MCI was defined with reference to the new Movement Disorder Society criteria.\nThe frequency of PD-MCI was 42.5% using level 2 criteria at 1.5 SDs below normative values. Memory impairment was the most common domain affected, with 15.1% impaired at 1.5 SDs. Depression scores were significantly higher in those with PD-MCI than the cognitively normal PD group. A significant correlation was found between visual Pattern Recognition Memory and cerebrospinal \u03b2-amyloid 1-42 levels (\u03b2 standardized coefficient = 0.350; p = 0.008) after controlling for age and education in a linear regression model, with lower \u03b2-amyloid 1-42 and 1-40 levels observed in those with PD-MCI. Voxel-based morphometry did not reveal any areas of significant gray matter loss in participants with PD-MCI compared with controls, and no specific genotype was associated with PD-MCI at the 1.5-SD threshold.\nIn a large cohort of newly diagnosed PD participants, PD-MCI is common and significantly correlates with lower cerebrospinal \u03b2-amyloid 1-42 and 1-40 levels. Future longitudinal studies should enable us to determine those measures predictive of cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) impairment is recognized to play a pathogenetic role in Parkinson's disease (PD). A reduced expression of lysosomal-associated membrane protein (lamp) 2A and heat shock cognate (hsc) 70 protein, the two key regulators of CMA, has been reported in brains of PD patients. To verify the existence of a possible systemic CMA dysfunction in PD, in this study the expression of hsc70 and lamp2A was assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with sporadic PD and compared to healthy subjects. The expression of myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), a transcriptional factor implicated in neuronal survival and specific substrate of CMA, was also evaluated. Protein and gene expression was assessed by Western blot and real-time PCR, respectively, in PBMC obtained from 53 sporadic PD patients and 53 healthy subjects. A significant reduction of hsc70 levels was observed in PBMC of PD patients, both under basal conditions and after autophagy induction obtained with serum deprivation. No difference emerged in lamp2A and MEF2D expression between patients and controls. No influence of the clinical characteristics of patients emerged on hsc70, lamp2A and MEF2D expression. These results, despite being not suggestive of the existence of a CMA impairment in PBMC of PD patients, identify a systemic hsc70 reduction in PD patients. Further studies on specific mechanisms and biological significance of such alteration are needed to corroborate this finding that could lead to the identification of a new trait biomarker for PD.",

High-beta cortico-STN coherence was maximal for midline cortical EEG electrodes, whereas the low-beta band was maximal for lateral electrodes (\u03c7(2)=20.60, p<0.0001).\nThe association between freezing of gait, high-beta STN oscillations and cortico-STN coherence suggests that this oscillatory activity might interfere in the frontal cortex-basal ganglia networks, thereby participating in the pathophysiology of FOG in PD.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa is the most effective therapy for Parkinson's disease, but chronic treatment is associated with the development of potentially disabling motor complications. Experimental studies suggest that motor complications are due to non-physiological, intermittent administration of the drug, and can be reduced with continuous delivery. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel delivered continuously through an intrajejunal percutaneous tube.\nIn our 12-week, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, double-titration trial, we enrolled adults (aged \u2265 30 years) with advanced Parkinson's disease and motor complications at 26 centres in Germany, New Zealand, and the USA. Eligible participants had jejunal placement of a percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube, and were then randomly allocated (1:1) to treatment with immediate-release oral levodopa-carbidopa plus placebo intestinal gel infusion or levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusion plus oral placebo. Randomisation was stratified by site, with a mixed block size of 2 or 4. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to final visit in motor off-time. We assessed change in motor on-time without troublesome dyskinesia as a prespecified key secondary outcome. We assessed efficacy in a full-analysis set of participants with data for baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment, and imputed missing data with the last observation carried forward approach. We assessed safety in randomly allocated patients who underwent the percutaneous gastrojejunostomy procedure. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00660387 and NCT0357994.\nFrom baseline to 12 weeks in the full-analysis set, mean off-time decreased by 4.04 h (SE 0.65) for 35 patients allocated to the levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel group compared with a decrease of 2.14 h (0.66) for 31 patients allocated to immediate-release oral levodopa-carbidopa (difference -1.91 h [95% CI -3.05 to -0.76]; p=0.0015). Mean on-time without troublesome dyskinesia increased by 4.11 h (SE 0.75) in the intestinal gel group and 2.24 h (0.76) in the immediate-release oral group (difference 1.86 [95% CI 0.56 to 3.17]; p=0.0059). In the safety analyses 35 (95%) of 37 patients allocated to the levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel group had adverse events (five [14%] serious), as did 34 (100%) of 34 patients allocated to the immediate-release oral levodopa-carbidopa group (seven [21%] serious), mainly associated with the percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube.\nContinuous delivery of levodopa-carbidopa with an intestinal gel offers a promising option for control of advanced Parkinson's disease with motor complications. Benefits noted with intestinal gel delivery were of a greater magnitude than were those obtained with medical therapies to date, and our study is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of the benefit of continuous levodopa delivery in a double-blind controlled study.\nAbbVie.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory mechanisms are activated in aging and late-onset neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) contribute to both idiopathic and familial forms of PD. Here, we investigated the involvement of LRRK2 in inflammatory pathways using primary dermal fibroblasts from patients with 2 common mutations in LRRK2 (G2019S and R1441G), idiopathic PD and age-matched healthy individuals. Basal cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 RNA levels were very high in the fibroblasts of all patients. Remarkably, LRRK2 silencing experiments significantly reduced basal COX-2 levels and COX-2 induction after a pro-inflammatory stimulus. Additionally, in samples from patients with the R1441G mutation and with idiopathic PD, we found a prominent cytoplasmic re-distribution of human antigen R, a protein that, among others, stabilizes COX-2 RNA. Furthermore, the response to lipopolysaccharide was defective in these 2 groups, which showed weak induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced NF\u03baB transcriptional activation. In summary, we describe multiple defects in inflammatory pathways in which LRRK2 appears to be critically involved. Further studies are required to establish the therapeutic implications of inflammatory dysregulation in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson disease has been associated with psychiatric adverse effects including anxiety, depression, mania, psychosis, and suicide.\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of deep brain stimulation in a large Parkinson disease clinical practice.\nPatients approved for surgery by the Mayo Clinic deep brain stimulation clinical committee participated in a 6-month prospective naturalistic follow-up study. In addition to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, stability and psychiatric safety were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Young Mania Rating scale. Outcomes were compared in patients with Parkinson disease who had a psychiatric history to those with no co-morbid psychiatric history.\nThe study was completed by 49 of 54 patients. Statistically significant 6-month baseline to end-point improvement was found in motor and mood scales. No significant differences were found in psychiatric outcomes based on the presence or absence of psychiatric comorbidity.\nOur study suggests that patients with Parkinson disease who have a history of psychiatric co-morbidity can safely respond to deep brain stimulation with no greater risk of psychiatric adverse effect occurrence. A multidisciplinary team approach, including careful psychiatric screening ensuring mood stabilization and psychiatric follow-up, should be viewed as standard of care to optimize the psychiatric outcome in the course of deep brain stimulation treatment.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine agonists (DA) are the first-choice drug for treatment of the early stage of Parkinson's disease (PD) in subjects younger than 70 years. Recently, a number of third generation DA have been marketed, including transdermal patch of rotigotine and extended release oral formulation of ropinirole and pramipexole.We investigated the impact of third generation DA on management of the early stage of PD in an outpatient service for Movement Disorders in Italy.\nTwo 12-month observation periods were selected (January - December, 2007, and January - December, 2011) as representative for prescription of immediate and extended release formulations of DA respectively. Within each period, PD patients were divided into subgroups according to age (<65 years; 65-75 years; >75 years) or functional requirement (high; moderate; low). For each period, the number of subjects receiving monotherapy with DA, monotherapy with levodopa (LD), or combined DA/LD therapy and the relative doses were calculated. The severity of parkinsonian motor symptoms was calculated by means of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) score. The frequency and severity of side-effects leading to discontinuation or reduction of DA drugs at each time point were also calculated.\nWe found a significant reduction of daily LD dose (both as mono- and combined therapy) between the second and the first observation period. There was also a significant increase of monotherapy with DA and corresponding reduction of monotherapy with LD in patients aged 65-75 years, as well as in PD patients with moderate functional requirements. A significant reduction of frequency of side-effects was measured with extended release DA as compared to immediate release formulations. There were no significant differences of the UPDRS-III scores between the 2 observation periods in any subgroup.\nOur results suggest that extended release DA might optimize therapeutic management of the early stages of PD even in patients older than 70 years of age.",

    "abstract": "We explored if magnetic resonance imaging sequences might aid in the clinical differential diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). We measured the volumes of the olfactory bulb, the olfactory tract, and olfaction-associated cortical gray matter in 20 IPD patients, 14 MSA patients, and 12 normal subjects, using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging sequences in combination with voxel-based statistical analysis. We found that, compared to normal subjects and MSA patients, the volumes of the olfactory bulb and tract were significantly reduced in IPD patients. The gray matter volume of IPD patients decreased in the following order: the olfactory area to the right of the piriform cortex, the right amygdala, the left entorhinal cortex, and the left occipital lobe. Further, the total olfactory bulb volume of IPD patients was associated with the duration of disease. The entorhinal cortical gray matter volume was negatively associated with the UPDRS III score.\nStructural volumes measured by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging may potentially be used for differential diagnosis of IPD from MSA.",

Forty-six (6.5%) patients presented with camptocormia at the time of evaluation. The mean disease duration of PD patients with camptocormia was significantly longer than that without camptocormia (P < 0.01). After adjusted for age and disease duration, compared with patients without camptocormia, PD patients with camptocormia presented with higher score of UPDRS part III (P < 0.01), higher H&Y stage (P < 0.01), higher score of Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (P < 0.01) and lower score of Mini-Mental Status Examination (P < 0.01). Binary logistic regression models indicated that camptocormia is associated with higher H&Y stage and UPDRS part III score. Camptocormia is not rare (6.5%) with the disease progression of PD in Chinese PD population and is associated with more advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "To observe the sedative and analgesic effects of dexmedetomidine (Dex) and its influence on respiration and blood pressure, evaluate electrophysiological monitoring and explore the optimal dose of Dex for brain nuclei lesion in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.\nApproved by hospital ethics committee, 60 PD patients undergoing brain nuclei lesion ablation were randomly allocated into 3 groups (n = 20 each). No sedative anesthetic was used in group A; In group B, Dex 0.3 \u00b5g/kg intravenously for initial bolus (duration 15 min) and then 0.3 \u00b5g\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7h(-1) continuous infusion; In group C, Dex 0.5 \u00b5g/kg intravenously (duration 15 min) for initial load and then 0.3 \u00b5g\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7h(-1) continuous infusion. The parameters of mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (P ETCO2), respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) and verbal rating score (VRS) were recorded at 0 min (baseline), 5 min (T1), 10 min (T2), 15 min (T3), 20 min (T4), 30 min (T5) and 60 min (T6) after the dosing of Dex.\nHR and respiratory rate decreased in groups B and C compared with baseline. In group C, P ETCO2 was much higher, compared with baseline (P < 0.05). Blood pressures of three groups were well-controlled. The incidence of pain (VRS \u2265 1) in group A was significantly higher than those of groups B and C (P < 0.05). And the incidence of sedation (OAA/S > 1) in group C was much higher than those of groups A and B. The electrophysiological signal of two patients in group C was severely affected.\nAt an initial intravenous dose of Dex 0.3 \u00b5g/kg and a maintenance dose of 0.3 \u00b5g \u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7h(-1), electrophysiological monitoring for surgery is not affected in PD patients undergoing brain nuclei lesion ablation. With a minimal interference of breath, Dex has not only well-controlled effects on sedation, analgesia and blood pressure, but also makes patients comfortable.",

    "abstract": "To analyze the clinical characteristics, correlation factors and clinical heterogeneities in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with cognitive impairment and identify whether cognitive impairment could influence the aspect of sleep.\nA total of 130 PD outpatients and inpatients of sleep center at our hospital were eligible for participation. According to Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA), they were divided into cognitive normal group (MOCA \u2265 26) (n = 51) and cognitive impairment group (MOCA < 26) (n = 79). Their clinical characteristics were mainly evaluated by unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) , Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) stage, Hamilton depression scale (HAMD-24 item) and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). And all of them underwent video-polysomnography (PSG).\nThe proportion of cognitive impairment (MOCA < 26) was 60.76%. Compared to those without cognitive impairment, the PD patients with cognitive impairment had significantly higher score of HAMD (10 \u00b1 7 vs 7 \u00b1 4), increased incidence of hallucinations (40.50% vs 19.60%) and REM behavior disorders (RBD) (63.29% vs 39.21%), significantly higher H-Y stage [2.5(2.0-3.0) vs 2.0 (2.0-2.5)] , United Kingdom Parkinson Disease Society (UPDRS) part III (22 \u00b1 10 vs 19 \u00b1 10) and levodopa-equivalent daily dose (LED) (511 \u00b1 302vs 380 \u00b1 272) (all P < 0.05). However, no significant differences existed in the subscores of MOCA between PD patients with different sides of onset and motor subtypes of onset (all P > 0.05). Non-conditional Logistic regression analysis showed that PD duration, score of HAMD and H-Y stage were the major influencing factors of cognition. On PSG, significantly decreased sleep efficiency (57% \u00b1 21% vs 66% \u00b1 17%), higher percentage of non-REM sleep stage 1 (NREMS1) (37% \u00b1 21% vs 27% \u00b1 13%), lower percentage of NREMS2 (40% \u00b1 17% vs 46% \u00b1 13%) and REM sleep (39% \u00b1 28% vs 54% \u00b1 36%) were found for PD patients with cognitive impairment (all P < 0.05).\nThe PD patients with cognitive impairment have more severe disease and partial nonmotor symptoms. And the severity of disease and depression is closely associated with cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment may also affect sleep to cause decreased sleep efficiency and severe sleep structure disorder.",

    "abstract": "An inverse relationship between Parkinson's disease (PD) and cancer has been described. However, the association between cancers and genetic forms of PD, in particular the R1441G mutation in the LRRK2 gene, is not well known. The objective of this work was to analyze cancer prevalence in PD patients with R1441G or G2019S mutations in LRRK2, and in idiopathic PD (iPD). A total of 732 patients with PD (70 and 25 carriers of R1441G or G2019S mutations, respectively), and 177 controls, were linked using a population-based cancer registry of the Spanish province of Gipuzkoa. Cancer prevalence was not significantly higher in PD-G2019S carriers (20%) than in PD-R1441G carriers (14.3%), iPD (13.8%), or controls (12.5%). With the exception of a high prevalence of hematological cancers (crude odds ratio of 7.1) in the R1441G group, specific cancer types were not increased in PD mutation carriers. In both the carrier and iPD groups, cancers were diagnosed after the onset of PD. PD patients had a similar prevalence of cancer to control subjects. There was no increased association between G2019S or R1441G mutations and any type of cancer. Although there was a higher prevalence of hematological cancers in the R1441G group, the low number of such cancers overall makes this finding of uncertain significance. There was a slightly higher but not statistically significant prevalence of non-skin cancers in the G2019S group, suggesting that further study to evaluate the association should be undertaken prior to ascribing an increased cancer risk to this population.",

We compared our results to the previous algorithm in terms of baseline prevalence and incidence of PD, as well as associations with baseline smoking characteristics.\nOur original case ascertainment used self-reported diagnosis, antiparkinsonian medication, and hospitalization discharge International Classification of Diseases-Ninth version code. In this study, we incorporated additional data from fee-for-service Medicare claims, extended follow-up time, review of hospitalization records, and adjudicated cause of death. Two movement disorders specialists adjudicated final PD status. We used logistic regression models and controlled for age, sex, African American race, and education.\nWe identified 75 additional cases but reclassified 80 previously identified cases as not having PD. We observed significant inverse association with smoking status (odds ratio\u2009=\u20090.42; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20090.22, 0.79), and inverse linear trends with pack-years (p\u2009=\u20090.005), and cigarettes per day (p\u2009=\u20090.019) with incident PD. All estimates were stronger than those from the previous algorithm.\nOur enhanced method did not alter prevalence and incidence estimates compared with our previous algorithm. However, our enhanced method provided stronger estimates of association, potentially due to reduced level of disease misclassification.",

    "abstract": "It is currently controversial if and in which terms Parkinson's disease (PD) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) are linked in co-morbid association. In a cohort of 106\u00a0de novo PD patients (67 male and 39 female, aged 42-83\u00a0years), 15 of them developed RLS, which was prospectively assessed at 6-month intervals from the starting of dopamine(DA)ergic therapy. The incidence rate of\u00a0total RLS was 47 per 1,000 case/person per year and 37 per 1,000 case/person per year after the exclusion of possible \"secondary\" forms\u00a0of the disorder (n\u00a0=\u00a03). These figures are higher than those reported in an incidence study conducted in German general population (Study of Health in Pomerania), in which the method of ascertainment of RLS similar to ours has been used. An incidence rate of total RLS significantly higher than that reported in the above-mentioned study was found in the age ranges 55-64\u00a0years and in the age range 45-74\u00a0years standardized to European general population 2013 \u00a0(70 and 53 per 1,000 case/person per year, respectively, p\u00a0< 0.01). Ten out of 12 patients (83.3\u00a0%) developed RLS within 24\u00a0months from the starting of DAergic medication (median latency 7.5\u00a0months). These findings support the view that sustained DAergic therapy could represent the critical factor inducing an increased incidence of RLS in patients with PD and that the latter disease should be regarded as the condition predisposing to the occurrence of the former and not viceversa as previously hypothesized. The mechanism underlying the increased incidence of RLS remains unclear and deserves further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Since patterns of cognitive dysfunction in mild Parkinson's disease associated with dementia (PDD) are similar to those in mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is difficult to accurately differentiate between these two types of dementia in their early phases using neuropsychological tests. The purpose of the current study was to investigate differences in cerebral perfusion patterns of patients with AD and PDD at the earliest stages using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).\nWe consecutively recruited 31 patients with mild PDD, 32 patients with mild probable AD and 33 age-matched healthy subjects. All subjects underwent (99m)Tc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime perfusion SPECT and completed general neuropsychological tests.\nWe found that both mild PDD and AD patients showed distinct hypoperfusion in frontal, parietal and temporal regions, compared with healthy subjects. More importantly, hypoperfusion in occipital and cerebellar regions was observed only in mild PDD.\nThe observation of a significant decrease in cerebral perfusion in occipital and cerebellar regions in patients with mild PDD is likely useful to differentiate between PDD and AD at the earliest stages.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, nine gene therapy clinical trials for Parkinson's disease (PD) have been initiated and completed. Starting with considerable optimism at the initiation of each trial, none of the programs has yet borne sufficiently robust clinical efficacy or found a clear path toward regulatory approval. Despite the immediately disappointing nature of the efficacy outcomes in these trials, the clinical data garnered from the individual studies nonetheless represent tangible and significant progress for the gene therapy field. Collectively, the clinical trials demonstrate that we have overcome the major safety hurdles previously suppressing central nervous system (CNS) gene therapy, for none produced any evidence of untoward risk or harm after administration of various vector-delivery systems. More importantly, these studies also demonstrated controlled, highly persistent generation of biologically active proteins targeted to structures deep in the human brain. Therefore, a renewed, focused emphasis must be placed on advancing clinical efficacy by improving clinical trial design, patient selection and outcome measures, developing more predictive animal models to support clinical testing, carefully performing retrospective analyses, and most importantly moving forward-beyond our past limits.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin A and carotenoids are involved in signalling pathways regulating gene expression in many organs, including the brain. The dopaminergic system is a target of retinoic acid action in the central nervous system. The aim of this review is to assess the epidemiological evidence on the association between blood levels or dietary intakes of vitamin A and carotenoids and risk of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nPubMed and ISI Web of Science were searched for relevant papers from 1990 to April 2013. Data reported in epidemiological studies assessing the association between vitamin A and/or carotenoids (\u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene, \u03b2-cryptoxanthin, lutein, lycopene, zeaxanthin and canthaxanthin) and PD were extracted for a narrative synthesis and meta-analysis.\nThirteen papers were included out of a total of 362 potentially relevant; of these, eight contributed to the meta-analysis. No statistically significant pooled estimate between micronutrient and PD was detected. Forest plots suggest possible non-significant inverse pooled estimates of \u03b1-carotene and \u03b2-carotene and risk of PD. A significant association between lutein intake and PD risk was detected in case-control studies only.\nData published to date are insufficient for drawing definite conclusions about the epidemiological evidence on the association between blood levels or dietary intakes of vitamin A and carotenoids and the risk of PD. Results should be interpreted particularly cautiously given the limitation of the present meta-analysis and the potential publication bias. Authors are urged to follow more closely the recommendations for reporting epidemiological studies in order to enhance the capacity for synthesising the evidence.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease for which leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2 carriers) p.G2019S confers substantial genotypic and population attributable risk. With informed consent, we have recruited clinical data from 778 patients from Tunisia (of which 266 have LRRK2 parkinsonism) and 580 unaffected subjects. Motor, autonomic, and cognitive assessments in idiopathic Parkinson disease and LRRK2 patients were compared with regression models. The age-associated cumulative incidence of LRRK2 parkinsonism was also estimated using case-control and family-based designs. LRRK2 parkinsonism patients had slightly less gastrointestinal dysfunction and rapid eye movement sleep disorder. Overall, disease penetrance in LRRK2 carriers was 80% by 70 years but women become affected a median 5 years younger than men. Idiopathic Parkinson disease patients with younger age at diagnosis have slower disease progression. However, age at diagnoses does not predict progression in LRRK2 parkinsonism. LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation is a useful aid to diagnosis and modifiers of disease in LRRK2 parkinsonism may aid in developing therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the auditory blink reflex is a measure of sensorimotor gating, which reflects an organism's ability to filter out irrelevant sensory information. PPI has never been studied in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), although sensorimotor deficits are frequently associated with synucleinopathies. We investigated whether alterations in PPI were more pronounced in MSA compared with Parkinson's disease (PD), idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and healthy controls.\n10 patients with MSA, 12 patients with iRBD, 40 patients with PD, and 20 healthy controls completed the study. A passive acoustic prepulse inhibition paradigm was applied with prepulses 5 dB and 15 dB above background noise at 30-, 60-, 120- and 300-ms intervals.\nNon-parametric analyses showed that MSA patients had significantly lower prepulse inhibition, as measured with max-amplitude, than PD patients and iRBD patients on the 60 ms-85 dB and 120 ms-85 dB inter-stimulus intervals. The same relation was found when using area under the curve. No differences were found between groups for the 30 ms-85 dB and 300 ms-85 dB. Furthermore, blink reflex characteristics such as habituation did not differ between patients and controls.\nThe present study showed that sensorimotor gating, as measured with PPI, is markedly reduced in MSA. This may be due to the pronounced severity of striatal and brainstem dysfunction, as well as the degeneration of other structures related to the PPI modulating pathways in MSA. PPI may be a non-invasive neurophysiological measure that can aid in the differential diagnosis between PD and MSA.",

    "abstract": "To explore whether self-rated health acts as a potential mediator in the association between functional status and health-related quality of life in Parkinson's disease.\nOlder persons (as most patients with Parkinson's disease are) who reported poor self-rated health compared with those with excellent self-rated health were two-and-a-half times more likely to have experienced a decline in functional ability.\nCross-sectional.\nSocio-demographic and clinical data of the patients (n = 176) were obtained during a structured interview and from medical records. Functional status was measured with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (total score), self-rated health with the first item of the Short-Form 36-item Health Survey Questionnaire and health-related quality of life with the disease-specific questionnaire called the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire-39. Multiple linear regression analyses and the Sobel test were employed to assess mediation.\nSelf-rated health seems to have a mediating effect on the association between functional status and health-related quality of life. The Sobel test confirmed an indirect effect of functional status via self-rated health on health-related quality of life and showed a statistically significant indirect effect of functional status on health-related quality of life via self-rated health against the direct route without the mediator.\nSelf-rated health partially mediates the deteriorating effect of functional status on health-related quality of life.\nSupportive and adaptation psychosocial intervention programmes leading to restored self-rated health may enhance the quality of life regardless of disability in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "To examine the influence of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on driving in patients with Parkinson disease (PD).\nUsing a driving simulator setup proven to reflect on-road driving, 2 main analyses were performed: 1) comparison of driving performance among 23 patients with deep brain surgery (DBS patients), 21 patients without surgery (no-DBS patients), and 21 controls; and 2) analysis of the effect of stimulation vs levodopa on driving performance. To this end, 3 tests were run in the medicated DBS patient cohort, with 3 different conditions: \"stimulation on\" (STIM) (equated to daily treatment), \"stimulation off\" (OFF), and \"stimulation off/levodopa\" (LD) (dosage aimed at maintaining motor status). Differences in driving times and errors among conditions were analyzed.\nAge and cognitive deficits influenced driving performance negatively. The no-DBS patient group performed worse in driving time and driving errors than controls. DBS patients drove slower than controls and no-DBS patients. Driving safety was comparable to controls but higher than in no-DBS patients. Within the DBS patient group, driving was more accurate with STIM than with LD, although motor effects did not differ. Driving with STIM, but not with LD, was superior to driving in the OFF condition.\nDBS of the STN seems to have a beneficial effect on driving ability in patients with PD, potentially because of nonmotor driving-relevant aspects. Our data suggest that driving permission for DBS-treated patients with PD should not be handled more restrictively than permissions for patients with PD in general.\nThis study provides Class IV evidence that STN-DBS in patients with PD is associated with a reduction in driving errors and improvements in driving accuracy in driving simulations.",

The study comprised 119,166 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 71 years in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, who completed a baseline questionnaire in 1995-1996 and a follow-up survey in 2004-2006. A total of 410 self-reported PD diagnoses were identified between 1995 and 2006. Multivariate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from logistic regression models. PD risk was not significantly associated with female reproductive factors including age at menarche, age at first live birth, parity, and age at menopause. For example, compared with women with natural menopause at age 50 to 54 years, the ORs were 1.18, (95% CI, 0.78-1.79) for women with natural menopause aged <45, 1.19 (95% CI, 0.88-1.61) for those aged 45 to 49, and 1.33 (95% CI, 0.91-1.93) for those aged 55 or older. We found that oral contraceptive use for \u226510 years (vs. never used) was associated with lower PD risk (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.92), but shorter use showed no association. Use of menopausal hormone therapy showed inconsistent results. Compared with non-hormone users at baseline, current hormone users for <5 years showed a higher risk of PD (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.08). However, no associations were observed for past hormone users or current users of \u22655 years. Overall, this large prospective study provides little support for an association between female reproductive factors and PD risk. Our findings on long-term oral contraceptive use and current hormone therapy warrant further investigations.",

Data were collected through in-depth interviews and analyzed using the grounded theory of Strauss and Corbin.\nThe core category of the participants' health-illness transition emerged as 'reshaping identity following uncontrollable changes'. The participants' health-illness transition process consisted of six phases in sequence: ego withdrawal, loss of role, frustration, change of thought, modification of life tract, and second life. Although most participants proceeded through the six phases chronologically, some returned to the frustration phase and then took up the remaining phases.\nThe study results provide an in-depth understanding of health-illness transition experiences in the participants.

    "abstract": "Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a multidomain protein implicated in Parkinson disease (PD); however, the molecular mechanism and mode of action of this protein remain elusive. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), along with other kinases, has been suggested to be an upstream kinase regulating LRRK2 function. Using MS, we detected several sites phosphorylated by PKA, including phosphorylation sites within the Ras of complex proteins (ROC) GTPase domain as well as some previously described sites (S910 and S935). We systematically mapped those sites within LRRK2 and investigated their functional consequences. S1444 in the ROC domain was confirmed as a target for PKA phosphorylation using ROC single-domain constructs and through site-directed mutagenesis. Phosphorylation at S1444 is strikingly reduced in the major PD-related LRRK2 mutations R1441C/G/H, which are part of a consensus PKA recognition site ((1441)RASpS(1444)). Furthermore, our work establishes S1444 as a PKA-regulated 14-3-3 docking site. Experiments of direct binding to the three 14-3-3 isotypes gamma, theta, and zeta with phosphopeptides encompassing pS910, pS935, or pS1444 demonstrated the highest affinities to phospho-S1444. Strikingly, 14-3-3 binding to phospho-S1444 decreased LRRK2 kinase activity in vitro. Moreover, substitution of S1444 by alanine or by introducing the mutations R1441C/G/H, abrogating PKA phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding, resulted in increased LRRK2 kinase activity. In conclusion, these data clearly demonstrate that LRRK2 kinase activity is modulated by PKA-mediated binding of 14-3-3 to S1444 and suggest that 14-3-3 interaction with LRRK2 is hampered in R1441C/G/H-mediated PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting people over age 55. Oxidative stress actively participates in the dopaminergic (DA) neuron degeneration of PD. Xyloketals are a series of natural compounds from marine mangrove fungus strain No. 2508 that have been reported to protect against neurotoxicity through their antioxidant properties. However, their protection versus 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced neurotoxicity is only modest, and appropriate structural modifications are necessary to discover better candidates for treating PD. In this work, we designed and synthesized 39 novel xyloketal derivatives (1-39) in addition to the previously reported compound, xyloketal B. The neuroprotective activities of all 40 compounds were evaluated in vivo via respiratory burst assays and longevity-extending assays. During the zebrafish respiratory burst assay, compounds 1, 9, 23, 24, 36 and 39 strongly attenuated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation at 50 \u03bcM. In the Caenorhabditis elegans longevity-extending assay, compounds 1, 8, 15, 16 and 36 significantly extended the survival rates (p < 0.005 vs. dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)). A total of 15 compounds were tested for the treatment of Parkinson's disease using the MPP+-induced C. elegans model, and compounds 1 and 8 exhibited the highest activities (p < 0.005 vs. MPP+). In the MPP+-induced C57BL/6 mouse PD model, 40 mg/kg of 1 and 8 protected against MPP+-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration and increased the number of DA neurons from 53% for the MPP+ group to 78% and 74%, respectively (p < 0.001 vs. MPP+ group). Thus, these derivatives are novel candidates for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease patients. The reasons for its perception are not completely understood. One suggested possibility might be that perceived fatigue is related with abnormal interpretation of somatic symptoms. It has been described that somatic markers misinterpretation leads to poor decision-making. We hypothesized that fatigued Parkinson's disease patients would show poorer performance than non-fatigued in a decision-making task.\nTo test our hypothesis, 89 Parkinson's disease patients were assessed for the presence of fatigue using the Parkinson Fatigue Scale. All patients were also administered scales evaluating psychopathology and neuropsychological tests, including the Iowa Gambling Task.\n33 (37.1%) patients fulfilled the established criteria for fatigue. In the univariate analysis, fatigued patients showed higher levels of anxiety (state: p = 0.001, trait: p < 0.001), impulsivity (p = 0.051), and depression (p < 0.001) than non-fatigued patients. No statistically significant differences in other neuropsychological test results (Stroop, Trail Making Test, Tower of London) were found between fatigued and non-fatigued patients except for the Iowa Gambling Task, in which fatigued patients showed poorer performance (p = 0.001) after controlling for confounding factors.\nThese results suggest that fatigued Parkinson's disease patients may present abnormal decision-making process, which may reflect abnormal processing of somatic markers when faced with an activity that requires effort.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the development and evaluation of a method for enabling quantitative and automatic scoring of alternating tapping performance of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Ten healthy elderly subjects and 95 patients in different clinical stages of PD have utilized a touch-pad handheld computer to perform alternate tapping tests in their home environments. First, a neurologist used a web-based system to visually assess impairments in four tapping dimensions ('speed', 'accuracy', 'fatigue' and 'arrhythmia') and a global tapping severity (GTS). Second, tapping signals were processed with time series analysis and statistical methods to derive 24 quantitative parameters. Third, principal component analysis was used to reduce the dimensions of these parameters and to obtain scores for the four dimensions. Finally, a logistic regression classifier was trained using a 10-fold stratified cross-validation to map the reduced parameters to the corresponding visually assessed GTS scores. Results showed that the computed scores correlated well to visually assessed scores and were significantly different across Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores of upper limb motor performance. In addition, they had good internal consistency, had good ability to discriminate between healthy elderly and patients in different disease stages, had good sensitivity to treatment interventions and could reflect the natural disease progression over time. In conclusion, the automatic method can be useful to objectively assess the tapping performance of PD patients and can be included in telemedicine tools for remote monitoring of tapping.",

    "abstract": "Mitophagy, or the selective clearance of mitochondria by autophagy, plays a key role in mitochondrial quality control. Due to their postmitotic nature and metabolic dependence on mitochondria, either insufficient or unchecked mitophagy is detrimental to neurons. To better understand signals that regulate this process, we treated primary rat cortical neurons with the electron transport chain complex I inhibitor rotenone to elicit mitophagy. The lipidomic profiles of mitochondria from control or injured neurons were analyzed by mass spectrometry, revealing a significant redistribution of cardiolipin (CL) from the inner mitochondrial membrane to the outer mitochondrial surface. Direct liposome-binding studies, computational modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis indicate that microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1LC3/LC3), a defining protein of autophagic membranes, binds to CL. Preventing this interaction inhibits rotenone-induced mitochondrial delivery to autophagosomes and lysosomes and attenuates mitochondrial loss as assessed by western blot. The CL-LC3 interaction is also important for mitophagy induced by other stimuli including 6-hydroxydopamine, another chemical model of Parkinson disease. Given that a conserved LC3 phosphorylation site is adjacent to key residues involved in CL binding, signaling pathways could potentially modulate this interaction to fine-tune the mitochondrial recycling response.",

    "abstract": "To complement the molecular pathways contributing to Parkinson's disease (PD) and identify potential biomarkers, gene expression profiles of two regions of the medulla were compared between PD patients and control. GSE19587 containing two groups of gene expression profiles [6 dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNV) samples from PD patients and 5 from controls, 6 inferior olivary nucleus (ION) samples from PD patients and 5 from controls] was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. As a result, a total of 1569 and 1647 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were, respectively, screened in DMNV and ION with limma package of R. The functional enrichment analysis by DAVID server (the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) indicated that the above DEGs may be involved in the following processes, such as regulation of cell proliferation, positive regulation of macromolecule metabolic process, and regulation of apoptosis. Further analysis showed that there were 365 common DEGs presented in both regions (DMNV and ION), which may be further regulated by eight clusters of microRNAs retrieved with WebGestalt. The genes in the common DEGs-miRNAs regulatory network were enriched in regulation of apoptosis process via DAVID analysis. These findings could not only advance the understandings about the pathogenesis of PD, but also suggest potential biomarkers for this disease.",

    "abstract": "Degradation of the somatosensory system has been implicated in postural instability and increased falls risk for older people and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Here we demonstrate that textured insoles provide a passive intervention that is an inexpensive and accessible means to enhance the somatosensory input from the plantar surface of the feet.\n20 healthy older adults (controls) and 20 participants with PD were recruited for the study. We evaluated effects of manipulating somatosensory information from the plantar surface of the feet using textured insoles. Participants performed standing tests, on two different surfaces (firm and foam), under three footwear conditions: 1) barefoot; 2) smooth insoles; and 3) textured insoles. Standing balance was evaluated using a force plate yielding data on the range of anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway, as well as standard deviations for anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway.\nOn the firm surface with eyes open both the smooth and textured insoles reduced medial-lateral sway in the PD group to a similar level as the controls. Only the textured insole decreased medial-lateral sway and medial-lateral sway standard deviation in the PD group on both surfaces, with and without visual input. Greatest benefits were observed in the PD group while wearing the textured insoles, and when standing on the foam surface with eyes closed.\nData suggested that textured insoles may provide a low-cost means of improving postural stability in high falls-risk groups, such as people with PD.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disorders are a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and they significantly impair the sleep quality of the PD patients. However, there is no conclusive evidence to support the relation between PD and the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The purpose of this meta-analysis review is to evaluate the association between PD and the prevalence of OSA.\nA comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed and Embase through July 2013. Only studies that referred to PD and the prevalence of OSA and that met the selection criteria were included in the analysis. The odds ratios (ORs) were used to evaluate the relationship of PD and the prevalence of OSA by the fixed-effect model.\nFive eligible studies were analyzed in this study including 322 cases and 6,361 controls. The pooled-analysis showed the OR to be 0.60 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44 to 0.81, P = 0.001) and I(2) = 0.0% (\u03c7(2) = 3.90, P = 0.420) in the fixed-effect model.\nAlthough we only included five small sample studies that indicated high homogeneity in the heterogeneity test, the results suggest that there is a significant negative association between PD and the prevalence of OSA; PD patients generally have a reduced prevalence of OSA. According to our analysis, these results are primarily due to the lower BMI of PD patients when compared with the general population controls.",

    "abstract": "We propose a computational model of Precision Grip (PG) performance in normal subjects and Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Prior studies on grip force generation in PD patients show an increase in grip force during ON medication and an increase in the variability of the grip force during OFF medication (Ingvarsson et al., 1997; Fellows et al., 1998). Changes in grip force generation in dopamine-deficient PD conditions strongly suggest contribution of the Basal Ganglia, a deep brain system having a crucial role in translating dopamine signals to decision making. The present approach is to treat the problem of modeling grip force generation as a problem of action selection, which is one of the key functions of the Basal Ganglia. The model consists of two components: (1) the sensory-motor loop component, and (2) the Basal Ganglia component. The sensory-motor loop component converts a reference position and a reference grip force, into lift force and grip force profiles, respectively. These two forces cooperate in grip-lifting a load. The sensory-motor loop component also includes a plant model that represents the interaction between two fingers involved in PG, and the object to be lifted. The Basal Ganglia component is modeled using Reinforcement Learning with the significant difference that the action selection is performed using utility distribution instead of using purely Value-based distribution, thereby incorporating risk-based decision making. The proposed model is able to account for the PG results from normal and PD patients accurately (Ingvarsson et al., 1997; Fellows et al., 1998). To our knowledge the model is the first model of PG in PD conditions.",

    "abstract": "Poverty of spontaneous movement, slowed execution and reduced amplitudes of movement (akinesia, brady- and hypokinesia) are cardinal motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease that can be modeled in experimental animals by brain lesions affecting midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Most behavioral investigations in experimental parkinsonism have employed short-term observation windows to assess motor impairments. We postulated that an analysis of longer-term free exploratory behavior could provide further insights into the complex fine structure of altered locomotor activity in parkinsonian animals. To this end, we video-monitored 23 h of free locomotor behavior and extracted several behavioral measures before and after the expression of a severe parkinsonian phenotype following bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the rat dopaminergic substantia nigra. Unbiased stereological cell counting verified the degree of midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase positive cell loss in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. In line with previous reports, overall covered distance and maximal motion speed of lesioned animals were found to be significantly reduced compared to controls. Before lesion surgery, exploratory rat behavior exhibited a bimodal distribution of maximal speed values obtained for single movement episodes, corresponding to a \"first\" and \"second gear\" of motion. 6-OHDA injections significantly reduced the incidence of second gear motion episodes and also resulted in an abnormal prolongation of these fast motion events. Likewise, the spatial spread of such episodes was increased in 6-OHDA rats. The increase in curvature of motion tracks was increased in both lesioned and control animals. We conclude that the discrimination of distinct modes of motion by statistical decomposition of longer-term spontaneous locomotion provides useful insights into the fine structure of fluctuating motor functions in a rat analog of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by muscle and movement disorder, often associated with depression. PD is very difficult to treat. Hence, the present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of G-CSF in PD associated with depression.\nAdult Wistar male rats weighing about 180-250 g were selected and divided into five groups in parallel designed method namely; control group (n = 5); sham operated group (n = 5); Vehicle group (n = 5); G-CSF group (70 \u03bcg/kg, s.c.) (n = 5) and L-DOPA group (n = 5). The rats were treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) on day 0 and then treatment was continued for 14 day of L-DOPA/carbidopa, whereas G-CSF (70 \u03bcg/kg, s.c.) was given from day 1 to 6. Thereafter, adhesive removal and forced swim tests were conducted to evaluate the behavioral outcome of G-CSF treatment. The finding was correlated and analyzed with Nissl staining findings for the final conclusion.\nThe behavioral parameters were assessed and found to be ameliorate the symptoms of Parkinson's and reduced the depression like behavior in PD. The histological findings were supported the behavioral findings and showed pathological improvement.\nAs a preliminary work, the present study first time suggested that G-CSF have a potential role in PD and associated depression.",

    "abstract": "The limitations of currently available therapies in addressing the non motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) have egged on the search for newer options. Zonisamide has been in use for epilepsy and it was serendipitously found to improve the symptoms of PD in a patient who had both epilepsy and PD. Thereafter, various trials were designed to assess the use of zonisamide in PD. The present article investigates the evidence for use of zonisamide in PD from the various clinical trials that were designed to address this issue. Furthermore, the article also summarizes the various mechanisms of its use in PD as described in various animal experiments. A search protocol was designed with predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The databases searched were Pubmed, Ovid medline, Cochrane and clinicaltrials.gov. The data thus generated, was fed into a predesigned format. Most of the clinical trials on zonisamide in PD have come from Japan. Most of these trials used the changes in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score as the endpoints and the most conclusive evidence is for a dose of 25-50 mg, which caused a change in UPDRS part III (motor symptoms). These patients were on levodopa and other drugs used for PD during the trials. One of the clinical trials conducted in Spain investigates the use of zonisamide in impulse control disorders among 15 patients of PD. Among the many mechanisms postulated, a reduction in levodopa induced quinone formation, protection against mitochondrial impairment and an increase in astroglial cysteine transport, an inhibition of microglial activation, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibition, an increased dopamine release and blockade of calcium channels are the most cited. There is evidence for use of zonisamide in PD in addition to levodopa and other therapies for control of motor symptoms. For now, the evidence for its use in control of non motor symptoms in PD is not enough and needs to be investigated further.",

    "abstract": "With a substantial increase in diagnosed Parkinson's disease, it is of great importance to examine tolerance and physical measures of evolving exercise interventions. Of particular importance, a multifaceted exercise intervention combining active-assisted cycling and resistance training to older adults diagnosed with Parkinson's disease is being assessed.\nFourteen older adults diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and ten healthy older adults (67.5 \u00b1 7.9 years of age) engaged in an 8-week, 24-session, multifaceted exercise protocol. The protocol consisted of both active-assisted cycling and resistance training. Tolerance was measured, as well as multiple indicators of health-related physical fitness. These indicators examined improvements in cardiovascular performance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility.\nTwenty-two older adults and older adults diagnosed with Parkinson's disease tolerated the intervention by completing all 24 sessions. Repeated-measures analysis of variance demonstrated significant (P \u2264 0.003) improvements in cardiovascular performance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility for both groups of individuals.\nThe multifaceted intervention is the first to combine both active-assisted cycling and resistance training. The older adult and the older adult diagnosed with Parkinson's disease exhibited both tolerance and health-related improvements in physical fitness following the intervention.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) has acquired a relevant role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite being a safe procedure, it may expose patients to an increased risk to experience cognitive and emotional difficulties. Impairments in emotion recognition, mediated both by facial and prosodic expressions, have been reported in PD patients treated with such procedure. However, it is still unclear whether the STN per se is responsible for such changes or whether others factors like the microlesion produced by the electrode implantation may also play a role. In this study we evaluated facial emotions discrimination and emotions recognition using both facial and prosodic expressions in 12 patients with PD and 13 matched controls. Patients' were tested in four conditions: before surgery, both in on and off medication, and after surgery, respectively few days after STN implantation before turning stimulator on and few months after with stimulation on. We observed that PD patients were impaired in discriminating and recognizing facial emotions, especially disgust, even before DBS implant. Microlesion caused by surgical procedure was found to influence patients' performance on the discrimination task and recognition of sad facial expression while, after a few months of STN stimulation, impaired disgust recognition was again prominent. No impairment in emotional prosody recognition was observed both before and after surgery. Our study confirms that PD patients may experience a deficit in disgust recognition and provides insight into the differential effect of microlesion and stimulation of STN on several tasks assessing emotion recognition.",

    "abstract": "A recently published genome-wide association study in Caucasian and Asian populations showed a significant association between the bone marrow stromal cell antigen 1 (BST1) SNP rs11724635 and increased risk for Parkinson's disease (PD). To investigate whether BST1 rs11724635 increases the risk of PD, either by itself or in combination with environmental factors, we performed an association analysis of BST1 rs11724635 in a large cohort of Taiwanese patients with PD and age matched controls. The study used TaqMan genotyping, logistic regression, and haplotype methods. The genotype distribution of rs11724635 in PD patients (N = 468; p = 0.50) and control subjects (N = 487; p = 0.44) was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Compared with the AA genotype, the frequency of both CA and CC genotypes was not significantly different between the patient and control groups. The adjusted odd ratios (ORs) for CA and CC were not statistically significant (CA: OR = 0.962, 95% CI = 0.643-1.439, p = 0.850; CC: OR = 0.992, 95% CI = 0.654-1.503, p = 0.969). Of note, ever use of well water before the onset of PD symptoms had an impact on the occurrence of PD through interactions with BST1 rs11724635 AC (OR = 1.453, p = 0.024) and CC (OR = 1.623, p = 0.008). Our results show that the BST1 rs11724635 polymorphism alone is not associated with the development of PD, but it can interact with well water drinking to increase the risk of PD in this Taiwanese population.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the effect of caudal zona incerta-deep brain stimulation (cZi-DBS) on word-level speech intelligibility in patients with Parkinson's disease, under both an optimal listening condition and a simulated more naturalistic listening condition.\nSpoken single words were extracted from read samples collected from 10 bilaterally implanted patients with PD pre- and post-cZi-DBS. Intelligibility was assessed through a transcription task performed by 32 naive listeners under two listening conditions: (i) with low-amplitude conversational speech added as background and (ii) with no added background noise. The listeners' responses were scored in terms of agreement with the intended words.\nPost-operatively, the total intelligibility score was significantly lower when cZi stimulation was switched on compared with off, for both listening conditions (with and without added background noise). Intelligibility was also significantly lower on stimulation compared with preoperative recordings, but only when assessed in the listening condition without background noise. The listening condition with added background noise resulted in significantly lower intelligibility scores compared with the no added noise condition for all stimulation conditions.\nThe results of this study indicate that cZi-DBS in patients with PD can be detrimental to word-level speech intelligibility.",

    "abstract": "Autonomic dysfunction is common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We report autonomic function test results in a prevalent, largely untreated, Tanzanian population of PD patients, at different disease stages and investigate the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and mortality.\nEwing's battery of autonomic tests was carried out on a prevalent population of PD patients living in the rural Hai district of Tanzania. Where possible, all four tests were performed in the patient's home. The main outcome of interest was the presence of abnormalities of sympathetic or parasympathetic function. Information on medications used and other co-morbidities was recorded.\nAutonomic function tests were recorded for 29 subjects, of whom 3 were on medication at the time of assessment. Of the 26 unmedicated patients, 14 (53.8%) had at least one abnormal test result for autonomic function, of whom only 3 (21.4%) were in late stage disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage IV or V), compared to 7 (58.3%) of 12 with normal autonomic function tests in late stage disease. Ten subjects had died at 5-year follow-up, but there was no association between mortality and autonomic function test abnormalities.\nIn unmedicated subjects, many patients in late stage disease had relatively preserved autonomic function, compared to those in early stage disease. In people with PD who are taking medication, it may be that when autonomic dysfunction presents in late stage disease it is often due to side effects of medication rather than the disease itself.",

Dementia was revealed in 23 patients. Significant changes of different zones of brain-cortex were revealed in patients with Parkinson's disease accompanied by dementia. Changes were revealed in the hemispheres, particularly in frontal, temporal and occipital lobes. Thickness of lingual medial occipitotemporal gyrus can be used as a criterion for dementia prognosis. Individual patient monitoring and cortex alteration evaluation allow prognosticating increasing risk of cognitive disorders development and prescribing proper therapy.",

    "abstract": "Trace elements have been recognized to play an important role in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is difficult to precisely identify the relationship between these elements and the progression of PD because of an insufficient number of patients. In this study, quantifications of selenium (Se), copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) by atomic absorption spectrophotometry were performed in plasma from 238 PD patients and 302 controls recruited from eastern China, which is so far the largest cohort of PD patients and controls for measuring plasma levels of these elements. We found that plasma Se and Fe concentrations were significantly increased whereas Cu and Zn concentrations decreased in PD patients as compared with controls. Meanwhile, these four elements displayed differential changes with regard to age. Linear and logistic regression analyses revealed that both Fe and Zn were negatively correlated with age in PD patients. Association analysis suggests that lower plasma Se and Fe levels may reduce the risk for PD, whereas lower plasma Zn is probably a PD risk factor. Finally, a model was generated to predict PD patients based on the plasma concentrations of these four trace elements as well as other features such as sex and age, which achieved an accuracy of 80.97\u00b11.34% using 10-fold cross-validation. In summary, our data provide new insights into the roles of Se, Cu, Fe and Zn in PD progression.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variants of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) were reported to alter the risk for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the genetic spectrum of LRRK2 variants has not been clearly disclosed yet in Taiwanese population. Herein, we sequenced LRRK2 coding region in 70 Taiwanese early onset PD patients (age at onset \u2264 50), and found six amino acid-changing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, N551K, R1398H, R1628P, S1647T, G2385R and M2397T), one reported (R1441H) and 2 novel missense (R767H and S885N) mutations. We examined the frequency of identified LRRK2 variants by genotyping 573 Taiwanese patients with PD and 503 age-matched control subjects. The results showed that PD patients demonstrated a higher frequency of G2385R A allele (4.6%) than control subjects (2.1%; odds ratio = 2.27, 95% confidence interval: 1.38-3.88, P = 0.0017). Fewer PD patients (27.7%) carried the 1647T-2397T haplotype as compared with the control subjects (33.0%; odds ratio = 0.80, 95% confidence interval: 0.65-0.97, P = 0.0215). However, the frequency of 1647T-2385R-2397T haplotype (4.3%) in PD patients was still higher than in control subjects (1.9%, odds ratio: 2.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.27-3.78, P = 0.0058). While no additional subject was found to carry R767H and R1441H, one more patient was observed to carry the S885N variant. Our results indicate a robust risk association regarding G2385R and a new possible protective haplotype (1647T-2397T). Gene-environmental interaction and a larger cohort study are warranted to validate our findings. Additionally, two new missense mutations (R767H and S885N) regarding LRRK2 in PD patients were identified. Functional studies are needed to elucidate the effects of these LRRK2 variants on protein function.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of XP21279-carbidopa in patients with Parkinson's disease who experience motor fluctuations compared with immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa tablets. XP21279 is a levodopa prodrug that is actively absorbed by high-capacity nutrient transporters expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract and then rapidly converted to levodopa by carboxylesterases. XP21279-carbidopa sustained-release bilayer tablets were developed to overcome pharmacokinetic limitations of levodopa by providing more continuous exposure. Patients with motor fluctuations who required carbidopa-levodopa four or five times daily were optimized for 2 weeks each on carbidopa-levodopa four or five times daily and XP21279-carbidopa three times daily in a randomized sequence. Next, they received each optimized treatment for 2 weeks in a double-blind/double-dummy, randomized sequence. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline in daily off time at the end of each double-blind treatment period. All patients at 2 sites underwent pharmacokinetic analyses. Twenty-eight of 35 enrolled patients completed both double-blind treatments. The mean total daily off time was reduced from baseline by a mean (\u00b1 standard error) of 2.7 hours (\u00b1 0.48 hours) for immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa and 3.0 hours (\u00b1 0.57 hours) for XP21279-carbidopa (P = 0.49). Among 11 patients who completed pharmacokinetic sampling on each optimized treatment, the percentage deviation from the mean levodopa concentration was lower (P < 0.05) for XP21279-carbidopa than carbidopa-levodopa. Both treatments had a similar incidence of new or worsening dyskinesias. XP21279-carbidopa administered three times daily produced a reduction in off time similar to that of carbidopa-levodopa administered four or five times daily, and the difference was not statistically significant. XP21279-carbidopa significantly reduced variability in levodopa concentrations compared with carbidopa-levodopa.",

    "abstract": "The development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) has led to increasing interest in the retina in Parkinson's disease (PD). The retina is a multilayered tissue: looking into the eye from the outside, these layers comprise the nerve fiber layer (NFL); the ganglion cell layer (GCL); the inner plexiform layer (IPL), which contains the interconnecting plexus, including tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (dopaminergic) fibers of amacrine cells; the inner nuclear layer; and several outer retinal layers. Commercial spectral-domain OCT has a specific program for detecting peripapillary NFL defects and a different macular program for diabetic retinopathy. Specific programs for PD are not commercially available. Taking all studies together, it seems that macular programs have a higher diagnostic yield than NFL programs, but the numbers of studies and examined patients are relatively small. It is not certain that all retinal thinning in PD is due to dopaminergic neuronal loss. When applying OCT, the where (region of interest) and the what of the focus of automated programs must be considered. With these caveats, one could take advantage of the power of OCT for looking in-depth into the terra incognita of individual retinal layers at the fovea and perhaps at other appropriate retinal locations.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective technique for treating Parkinson's disease (PD) in the middle and advanced stages. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is the most common target for clinical treatment using DBS. While STN-DBS can significantly improve motor symptoms in PD patients, adverse cognitive effects have also been reported. The specific effects of STN-DBS on cognitive function and the related mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, it is imperative to identify the influence of STN-DBS on cognition and investigate the potential mechanisms to provide a clearer view of the various cognitive sequelae in PD patients. For this review, a literature search was performed using the following inclusion criteria: (1) at least 10 patients followed for a mean of at least 6 months after surgery since the year 2006; (2) pre- and postoperative cognitive data using at least one standardized neuropsychological scale; and (3) adequate reporting of study results using means and standard deviations. Of \u223c170 clinical studies identified, 25 cohort studies (including 15 self-controlled studies, nine intergroup controlled studies, and one multi-center, randomized control experiment) and one meta-analysis were eligible for inclusion. The results suggest that the precise mechanism of the changes in cognitive function after STN-DBS remains obscure, but STN-DBS certainly has effects on cognition. In particular, a progressive decrease in verbal fluency after STN-DBS is consistently reported and although executive function is unchanged in the intermediate stage postoperatively, it tends to decline in the early and later stages. However, these changes do not affect the improvements in quality of life. STN-DBS seems to be safe with respect to cognitive effects in carefully-selected patients during a follow-up period from 6 months to 9 years.",

    "abstract": "This study focused on the substantia nigra (SN) in Parkinson's disease (PD). We measured its area and volume, mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA) and iron concentration in early and late PD and correlated the values with clinical scores. Twenty-two early PD (EPD), 20 late PD (LPD) and 20 healthy subjects (age 64.7 \u00b1 4.9, 60.5 \u00b1 6.1, and 61 \u00b1 7.2 years, respectively) underwent 1.5 T MR imaging with double-TI-IR T1-weighted, T2*-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging scans. Relative SN area, MD, FA and R2* were measured in ROIs traced on SN. Correlation with Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores was assessed. In LPD, the SN area was significantly reduced with respect to EPD (p = 0.04) and control subjects (p < 0.001). In EPD, the SN area was also significantly smaller than in controls (p = 0.006). Similarly, the SN volume significantly differed between LPD and controls (p = 0.001) and between EPD and LPD (p = 0.049), while no significant differences were found between controls and EPD. Both SN area (r = 0.47, p = 0.004) and volume (r = 0.46, p = 0.005) correlated with UPDRS scores. At 1.5 T, SN morphological measurements were sensitive to early PD changes and able to track the disease progression, while MD and FA measures and relaxometry did not provide significant results.",

HTRA2 cDNA fragments from 80 patients with early-onset PD (onset \u226450\u00a0years) were sequenced. The identified variants were further examined for a cohort of PD and ethnically matched controls. A novel heterozygous R36W was identified in one early-onset and two late-onset PD patients, which was absent in 606 normal controls. The clinical features and 99mTc-TRODAT-1 SPECT image of the early-onset patient carrying R36W were similar to that of idiopathic PD. The R36W mutation of the patient was inherited from his mother whose SPECT revealed asymmetric reduction of 99mTc-TRODAT-1 uptake in the left striatum, suggesting that the defect of the nigrostriatal pathway may be attributable to the R36W in this family. Protein subcellular fractionation further revealed that R36W affected the processing of the proprotein after transport into mitochondria. Although the functional assays are promising, a larger cohort of both cases and controls should be screened to clarify the role of R36W in Taiwanese PD pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "To identify sociodemographic, clinical, and physician/practice factors associated with deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is a proven surgical therapy for Parkinson disease (PD), but is recommended only for patients with excellent health, results in significant out-of-pocket costs, and requires substantial physician involvement.\nRetrospective cohort study of more than 657,000 Medicare beneficiaries with PD. Multivariable logistic regression models examined the association between demographic, clinical, socioeconomic status (SES), and physician/practice factors, and DBS therapy.\nThere were significant disparities in the use of DBS therapy among Medicare beneficiaries with PD. The greatest disparities were associated with race: black (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16-0.25) and Asian (AOR 0.55, 95% CI 0.44-0.70) beneficiaries were considerably less likely to receive DBS than white beneficiaries. Women (AOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.75-0.83) also had lower odds of receiving DBS compared with men. Eighteen percent of procedures were performed on patients with PD who had cognitive impairment/dementia, a reported contraindication to DBS. Beneficiaries treated in minority-serving PD practices were less likely to receive DBS, regardless of individual race (AOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66-0.87). Even after adjustment for demographic and clinical covariates, high neighborhood SES was associated with 1.4-fold higher odds of receiving DBS (AOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.33-1.53).\nAmong elderly Medicare beneficiaries with PD, race, sex, and neighborhood SES are strong independent predictors of DBS receipt. Racial disparities are amplified when adjusting for physician/clinic characteristics. Future investigations of the demographic differences in clinical need/usefulness of DBS, ease of DBS attainment, and actual/opportunity DBS costs are needed to inform policies to reduce DBS disparities and improve PD quality of care.",

    "abstract": "Bradydiadochokinesia is one main clinical symptom in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). The pathogenesis of bradydiadochokinesia is not completely clear.\nFifteen patients with IPD and 15 age-matched healthy volunteers had to perform rhythmic alternating flexion and extension movements in the elbow joint. The rhythm was provided auditorily by a click tone stimulator. Six maneuvers (spatial extents of 48 and 83\u00b0 at frequencies of 0.45, 0.75 and 1.25 Hz) had to be absolved. The potentiometer converted the horizontal forearm movements into a variable voltage.\nThe duration of single movements varied more significantly in patients than in controls (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). Patients executed all conditions more slowly than controls, but this difference was only significant at the most difficult condition (83\u00b0 at 1.25 Hz; p < 0.01). The movement amplitudes or their variability were not significantly different at any condition. No parameter correlated significantly with the motor part of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) or with the duration of disease.\nAn insufficient temporal coordination contributes to bradydiadochokinesia in IPD. This deficit occurs independently of other parkinsonian cardinal motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "It has been recently proposed by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis that the CCDC62 variant rs12817488 is a new risk locus associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between rs12817488 and PD in a Chinese cohort. A total of 341 PD patients and 423 matched controls were recruited in Eastern China. Our results showed that the A allele of rs12817488 was significantly associated with an aggravated risk of PD (p = 0.006) and represented a major allele in contrast to a minor one in Caucasians. Genotype distributions also differed between PD patients and controls (p = 0.011 for AA/AG/GG). Further analysis showed that the association of rs12817488 with PD only existed in females. We also investigated the protein level of CCDC62 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 41 AA or GG carriers and found an apparently higher expression in PD patients carrying the AA genotype. A potential interaction was found between two estrogen-related loci, i.e. rs12817488/CCDC62 and rs2697962/PRDM2, particularly in the female stratum. In conclusion, our study demonstrated for the first time a significant association between the rs12817488 polymorphism and PD predisposition in a Chinese population with gender variations and provides new insight regarding the variant's protein expression and estrogen-related genetic interaction.",

    "abstract": "The patient was a 46-year-old woman requesting oral hygiene control. She had been treated for Parkinson's disease at the neurology department of another university hospital for 9 years. When the drugs were effective (drug efficacy), she could get out of bed and change clothes without assistance, albeit slowly. When the drugs were ineffective (no drug efficacy), however, she found it difficult to get out of bed, change clothes, or maintain posture during defecation without assistance. Occlusion was B-1 on the Eichner index, and neither dislocation of the temporomandibular joint nor mandibular tremor was observed. At her first visit, a medical history was taken and periodontal therapy commenced. Informed consent for bite splint therapy was obtained after examination of movement disorder. A bite splint was made for her, and any change in the grade of motor disorder using the bite splint evaluated. In addition, her grip strength was measured when wearing and not wearing the bite splint during periods of drug efficacy and no drug efficacy. The patient could get out of bed, change clothes, and maintain posture during defecation without assistance when wearing the bite splint, even during no drug efficacy. Grip strength in her left hand during drug efficacy and in both hands during no drug efficacy was greater when wearing the bite splint than without the bite splint. When this patient with Parkinson's disease wore a bite splint, her athletic ability and grip strength increased.",

    "abstract": "The ability to dynamically use various aspects of cognition is essential to daily function, and reliant on dopaminergic transmission in cortico-striatal circuitry. Our aim was to investigate both striatal and cortical dopaminergic changes in patients with Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment, who represent a vulnerable group for the development of dementia. We hypothesized severe striatal dopamine denervation in the associative (i.e. cognitive) region and cortical D2 receptor abnormalities in the salience and executive networks in Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment compared with cognitively normal patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy control subjects. We used positron emission tomography imaging with dopaminergic ligands (11)C-dihydrotetrabenazine, to investigate striatal dopamine neuron integrity in the associative subdivision and (11)C-FLB 457, to investigate cortical D2 receptor availability in patients with Parkinson's disease (55-80 years of age) with mild cognitive impairment (n = 11), cognitively normal patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 11) and age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 14). Subjects were administered a neuropsychological test battery to assess cognitive status and determine the relationship between dopaminergic changes and cognitive performance. We found that patients with mild cognitive impairment had severe striatal dopamine depletion in the associative (i.e. cognitive) subdivision as well as reduced D2 receptor availability in the bilateral insula, a key cognitive hub, compared to cognitively normal patients and healthy subjects after controlling for age, disease severity and daily dopaminergic medication intake. Associative striatal dopamine depletion was predictive of D2 receptor loss in the insula of patients with Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment, demonstrating interrelated striatal and cortical changes. Insular D2 levels also predicted executive abilities in these patients as measured using a composite executive z-score obtained from neuropsychological testing. Furthermore we assessed cortical thickness to ensure that D2 receptor changes were not confounded by brain atrophy. There was no difference between groups in cortical thickness in the insula, or any other cortical region of interest. These findings suggest that striatal dopamine denervation combined with insular D2 receptor loss underlie mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease and in particular decline in executive function. Furthermore, these findings suggest a crucial and direct role for dopaminergic modulation in the insula in facilitating cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials have demonstrated the capacity for dopamine neurons, transplanted ectopically into the striatum, to structurally integrate, restore dopamine transmission, and induce long-term functional benefits for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Despite this proof of principle, a number of limitations have hindered the development of cell replacement therapy over the past 20 years, particularly tissue availability, graft survival, and adequate reinnervation of the host brain. With a greater understanding of failure in prior clinical trials, increased knowledge of midbrain dopamine development (now including Wnts), and the development of pluripotent stem cell technologies, we are better equipped than ever to re-address a number of these challenges. This review summarizes the trials, tribulations, and progress in cell replacement therapy for PD. We discuss the prospects of modulating canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling to improve cell therapy based upon their roles in dopamine neural development and the adult brain. This will include the potential of Wnts to (i) expand fetally derived tissue in vitro and following transplantation, (ii) promote the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, (iii) increase graft integration and restoration of neural circuitry, and finally (iv) enhance graft survival.",

    "abstract": "Haemoglobins are iron-containing proteins that transport oxygen in the blood of most vertebrates. The mitochondrion is the cellular organelle which consumes oxygen in order to synthesise ATP. Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in neurodegeneration and ageing. We find that \u03b1 and \u03b2 haemoglobin (Hba and Hbb) proteins are altered in their distribution in mitochondrial fractions from degenerating brain. We demonstrate that both Hba and Hbb are co-localised with the mitochondrion in mammalian brain. The precise localisation of the Hbs is within the inner membrane space and associated with inner mitochondrial membrane. Relative mitochondrial to cytoplasmic ratios of Hba and Hbb show changing distributions of these proteins during the process of neurodegeneration in the pcd(5j) mouse brain. A significant difference in mitochondrial Hba and Hbb content in the mitochondrial fraction is seen at 31 days after birth, this corresponds to a stage when dynamic neuronal loss is measured to be greatest in the Purkinje Cell Degeneration mouse. We also report changes in mitochondrial Hba and Hbb levels in ageing brain and muscle. Significant differences in mitochondrial Hba and Hbb can be seen when comparing aged brain to muscle, suggesting tissue specific functions of these proteins in the mitochondrion. In muscle there are significant differences between Hba levels in old and young mitochondria. To understand whether the changes detected in mitochondrial Hbs are of clinical significance, we examined Parkinson's disease brain, immunohistochemistry studies suggest that cell bodies in the substantia nigra accumulate mitochondrial Hb. However, western blotting of mitochondrial fractions from PD and control brains indicates significantly less Hb in PD brain mitochondria. One explanation could be a specific loss of cells containing mitochondria loaded with Hb proteins. Our study opens the door to an examination of the role of Hb function, within the context of the mitochondrion-in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, leading to a wide range of disability and medical complications. Managing patients with Parkinson's disease in the perioperative hospital setting can be particularly challenging. Suboptimal management can lead to medical complications, prolonged hospital stays, and delayed recovery. This review aims to address the most important issues related to caring for patients with Parkinson's disease perioperatively who are undergoing emergent or planned general surgery. It also intends to help hospitalists, internists, and other health care providers mitigate potential in-hospital morbidity and prevent prolonged recovery. Challenges in managing patients with Parkinson's disease in the perioperative hospital setting include disruption of medication schedules, \"nothing by mouth\" status, reduced mobility, and medication interactions and their side effects. Patients with Parkinson's disease are more prone to immobility and developing dysphagia, respiratory dysfunction, urinary retention, and psychiatric symptoms. These issues lead to higher rates of pneumonia, urinary tract infections, deconditioning, and falls compared with patients without Parkinson's disease, as well as prolonged hospital stays and a greater need for post-hospitalization rehabilitation. Steps can be taken to decrease these complications, including minimizing nothing by mouth status duration, using alternative routes of drugs administration when unable to give medications orally, avoiding drug interactions and medications that can worsen parkinsonism, assessing swallowing ability frequently, encouraging incentive spirometry, performing bladder scans, avoiding Foley catheters, and providing aggressive physical therapy. Knowing and anticipating these potential complications allow hospital physicians to mitigate nosocomial morbidity and shorten recovery times and hospital stays.",

    "abstract": "Detecting very early markers of neurodegeneration that predate the diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is a crucial research topic for the development of disease-modifying therapeutic interventions. Recently (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy has become widely used for this purpose, since this test shows high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of PD, based on evidence that cardiac sympathetic nerve fibers are affected early and commonly in PD. We reviewed the literature to determine the role of MIBG myocardial scintigraphy for diagnosing pre-motor PD.\nWe performed a systematic review of the literature to identify the use of MIBG myocardial scintigraphy in relation to the constellation of pre-motor symptoms in PD.\nMild memory disorder, autonomic failure (constipation and postural hypotension), depression/anxiety, visual hallucination/psychosis (in the elderly), sleep disorder (REM sleep behavior disorder), and impaired olfaction are reported to appear as sole initial symptoms of PD. All clinical features except for impaired olfaction are accompanied by low MIBG uptake, suggestive of very early PD in situ.\nIdentifying persons with mild memory disorder, constipation/postural hypotension, depression/anxiety, visual hallucination/psychosis (in the elderly), and REM sleep behavior disorder associated with low MIBG uptake may provide a unique opportunity to detect very early PD in situ within a pre-clinical window. Future prospective studies to investigate further the findings of these early cases are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, primarily characterized by motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, stiffness, slowness and impaired equilibrium. Although the motor symptoms have been the focus in PD, slight cognitive deficits are commonly found in non-demented and non-depressed PD patients, even in early stages of the disease, which have been linked to the subsequent development of pathological dementia. Thus, strongly reducing the quality of life (QoL). Both levodopa therapy and deep brain stimulation (DBS) have yield controversial results concerning the cognitive symptoms amelioration in PD patients. That does not seems to be the case with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), although better stimulation parameters are needed. Therefore we hypothesize that simultaneously delivering cathodal tDCS (or ctDCS), over the right prefrontal cortex delivered with anodal tDCS (or atDCS) to left prefrontal cortex could be potentially beneficial for PD patients, either by mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity and by increases in the extracellular dopamine levels over the striatum.",

    "abstract": "The rapid finger-tapping test (RFT) is an important method for clinical evaluation of movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). In clinical practice, the naked-eye evaluation of RFT results in a coarse judgment of symptom scores. We introduce a novel computer-vision (CV) method for quantification of tapping symptoms through motion analysis of index-fingers. The method is unique as it utilizes facial features to calibrate tapping amplitude for normalization of distance variation between the camera and subject.\nThe study involved 387 video footages of RFT recorded from 13 patients diagnosed with advanced PD. Tapping performance in these videos was rated by two clinicians between the symptom severity levels ('0: normal' to '3: severe') using the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale motor examination of finger-tapping (UPDRS-FT). Another set of recordings in this study consisted of 84 videos of RFT recorded from 6 healthy controls. These videos were processed by a CV algorithm that tracks the index-finger motion between the video-frames to produce a tapping time-series. Different features were computed from this time series to estimate speed, amplitude, rhythm and fatigue in tapping. The features were trained in a support vector machine (1) to categorize the patient group between UPDRS-FT symptom severity levels, and (2) to discriminate between PD patients and healthy controls.\nA new representative feature of tapping rhythm, 'cross-correlation between the normalized peaks' showed strong Guttman correlation (\u03bc2=-0.80) with the clinical ratings. The classification of tapping features using the support vector machine classifier and 10-fold cross validation categorized the patient samples between UPDRS-FT levels with an accuracy of 88%. The same classification scheme discriminated between RFT samples of healthy controls and PD patients with an accuracy of 95%.\nThe work supports the feasibility of the approach, which is presumed suitable for PD monitoring in the home environment. The system offers advantages over other technologies (e.g. magnetic sensors, accelerometers, etc.) previously developed for objective assessment of tapping symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with limited knowledge about the normal function and effects of non-pharmacological therapies on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The aim of the study was to analyse the basal diurnal and total secretion of salivary cortisol in short- and long-term aspects of tactile massage (TM).\nProspective, Controlled and Randomised Multicentre Trial.\nForty-five women and men, aged 50-79 years, were recruited. Twenty-nine of them were blindly randomised to tactile massage (TM) and 16 of them to the control group, rest to music (RTM). Ten interventions were given during 8 weeks followed by a 26 weeks of follow up. Salivary cortisol was collected at 8 am, 1 pm, 8 pm, and 8 am the next day, on five occasions. With the first and eighth interventions, it was collected immediately before and after intervention.\nThe primary aim was to assess and compare cortisol concentrations before and immediately after intervention and also during the follow-up period. The secondary aim was to assess the impact of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), duration and severity of PD, effects of interventional time-point of the day, and levodopa doses on cortisol concentration.\nThe median cortisol concentrations for all participants were 16.0, 5.8, 2.8, and 14.0 nmol/L at baseline, later reproduced four times without significant differences. Cortisol concentrations decreased significantly after TM intervention but no change in diurnal salivary cortisol pattern was found. The findings of reduced salivary cortisol concentrations immediately after the interventions are in agreement with previous studies. However, there was no significant difference between the TM and control groups. There were no significant correlations between cortisol concentrations and age, gender, BMI, time-point for intervention, time interval between anti-parkinson pharmacy intake and sampling, levodopa doses, duration, or severity of PD.\nDiurnal salivary cortisol rhythm was normal. Salivary cortisol concentrations were significantly reduced after the TM intervention and after RTM, but there were no significant differences between the groups and no sustained long-term effect. No associations were seen between salivary cortisol concentration and clinical and/or pharmacological characteristics.\nClinicalTrial.gov, NCT01734876 and FoU Sweden 108881.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to explore whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphisms 196\u00a0G/A and 270 C/T confer susceptibility to Parkinson's disease (PD). The authors conducted a meta-analysis of the associations between the BDNF 196\u00a0G/A and 270 C/T polymorphisms and PD in subjects. They considered 12 studies in the case of the BDNF 196\u00a0G/A polymorphism and 4 studies in the case of the BDNF 270 C/T polymorphism. Meta-analysis showed no association between PD and the BDNF 196A allele in all study subjects (odds ratio [OR] = 1.066, 95% CI [0.972, 1.169], p = .173). However, ethnicity-specific meta-analysis identified an association between the BDNF 196 AA + AG genotype and PD in Europeans, but not in Asians (OR = 1.212, 95% CI [1.007, 1.458], p = .042; OR = 1.0567, 95% CI [0.913, 1.221], p = .465). Meta-analysis showed no association between PD and the BDNF 270 C/T polymorphism (OR for the T allele = 1.213, 95% CI [0.923, 1.595], p = .165). This meta-analysis identified an association between the BDNF 196\u00a0G/A polymorphism in Europeans, but not in Asians, but failed to identify an association between the BDNF 270 C/T polymorphism and PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized clinically by rest tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and pathologically by degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. Motor fluctuations (wearing off) and motor complications (dyskinesia) are common features of the long-term treatment of PD. Ongoing clinical and preclinical research has led to the discovery of promising new therapeutic targets that might prevent or reduce motor complications. Newer approaches modulating non-dopaminergic systems including adenosine A2A antagonists, monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors, glutamatergic antagonists, adrenergic receptor antagonists and serotonergic agents are encouraging strategies for management of advanced PD. Recent developments in levodopa delivery formulations include duodenal infusion of a levodopa/carbidopa, new extended-release levodopa and oral pro-levodopa forms. Recent clinical trials revealed diverse but promising results raising the possibility of new therapeutic modalities for PD in the near future.",

    "abstract": "SNCA is a pathogenic gene identified in rare familial PD, and over-expression of SNCA was suggested in the pathogenesis of familial and sporadic PD. Rep1 polymorphism of SNCA was associated with susceptibility to sporadic PD and SNCA expression in intro and in vivo. Hypomethylation in SNCA intron-1 was associated with increased SNCA expression and was observed in postmortem brains of patients with sporadic PD. We studied the methylation status of SNCA intron-1, SNCA mRNA levels and Rep1 genotypes in PBMCs of 100 sporadic PD patients and 95 controls and explored the relationship between DNA methylation, mRNA expression and Rep1 genotypes. Hypomethylation of SNCA intron-1 was detected in PBMCs of PD patients, and DNA methylation levels were associated with Rep1 polymorphism. The shorter allele was associated with higher level of SNCA intron-1 methylation, and genotypes carrying the shorter allele showed significantly higher methylation level of SNCA intron-1 than genotypes carrying the longer allele. However, SNCA mRNA levels were not associated with disease status, Rep1 polymorphism or DNA methylation of SNCA intron-1 in our study.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease belongs to the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders and manifests both with motor and non-motor symptoms. Symptomatic treatment of this disorder became more multifaceted over the past years: besides classical dopaminergic drugs and physiotherapy, novel invasive escalation treatment strategies became gold standard in many countries. On the other hand, non-motor symptoms significantly impacts quality of life in many patients which necessitates initiation of adequate therapy.\nDie Parkinson-Erkrankung geh\u00f6rt zu den h\u00e4ufigsten neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen und umfasst sowohl motorische als auch nicht-motorische Symptome. Die symptomatische Therapie dieser Erkrankung ist in den letzten Jahren vielf\u00e4ltiger geworden: Nebst den klassischen medikament\u00f6sen Therapiestrategien, die vorwiegend das dopaminerge System beeinflussen, und der Physiotherapie f\u00fcr die motorischen Symptome stehen heute in vielen L\u00e4ndern zus\u00e4tzlich operative Eskalationstherapien zur Verf\u00fcgung.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder caused by neurodegeneration in neocortex, substantia nigra and brainstem, and synucleinopathy. Some inherited PD is caused by mutations in \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn), and inherited and idiopathic PD is associated with mitochondrial perturbations. However, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are unresolved. We characterized a human \u03b1Syn transgenic mouse model and tested the hypothesis that the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is involved in the disease mechanisms. C57BL/6 mice expressing human A53T-mutant \u03b1Syn driven by a thymic antigen-1 promoter develop a severe, age-related, fatal movement disorder involving ataxia, rigidity, and postural instability. These mice develop synucleinopathy and neocortical, substantia nigra, and cerebello-rubro-thalamic degeneration involving mitochondriopathy and apoptotic and non-apoptotic neurodegeneration. Interneurons undergo apoptotic degeneration in young mice. Mutant \u03b1Syn associated with dysmorphic neuronal mitochondria and bound voltage-dependent anion channels. Genetic ablation of cyclophilin D, an mPTP modulator, delayed disease onset, and extended lifespans of mutant \u03b1Syn mice. Thus, mutant \u03b1Syn transgenic mice on a C57BL/6 background develop PD-like phenotypes, and the mPTP is involved in their disease mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that epigenetic factors may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). In our previous work, we sequenced the exomes of sixteen patients from eight Chinese PD families using whole exome sequencing technology, consequently three patients from different pedigrees were found sharing the variant c.1460C\u2009>\u2009T (rs150689919) in the coding region of the Tet methyl cytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) gene.\nIn order to evaluate the possible association between sporadic PD and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs150689919 in TET1, a case-control cohort study was conducted in 514 sporadic PD patients and 529 normal controls. Genotyping was determined by PCR and direct sequencing. Statistical significance was analyzed by the Chi-squared test.\nThere was no statistical significance in TET1 rs150689919 genotype or allele frequencies between the PD cases and healthy controls, even after being stratified by gender and age at onset.\nOur findings suggest that rs150689919 in TET1 may not be associated with PD in Chinese population. However, due to the limited data in this study, replication studies in larger sample and other populations are required.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral mitochondrial dysfunction has been observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). If mitochondrial dysfunction is an early event contributing to PD development, then noninvasive techniques that detect disturbed energy metabolism in vivo might be useful tools for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that proton ((1) H) and phosphorus ((31) P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures of brain metabolites are able to differentiate between individuals with early PD and healthy volunteers (HVs).\nDuring this cross-sectional study including 20 subjects with early PD and 15 age-matched HV, ventricular lactate (anaerobic glycolysis); and regional levels of N-acetylaspartate (neuronal integrity); choline (membrane turnover); creatine (energy metabolism); ATP and other phosphate-containing compounds (oxidative phosphorylation) were determined using brain (1) H and (31) P MRS.\nNo metabolic abnormalities were detectable in early-stage PD patients. Metabolite concentrations were not related to age, disease duration, or Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores.\nIn early PD, neither (1) H nor (31) P MRS were able to detect metabolic abnormalities, a finding that is in contrast to published data in more advanced PD cohorts. MRS under dynamic conditions might uncover latent energy deficits in early PD, thus warranting future study.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is classically characterized by motor symptoms; however, non-motor symptoms (NMS) are increasingly recognized as relevant in disease-state, given the associated alterations in mood (depression and anxiety) and cognition. Here, particularly in regards to NMS, we aimed to compare the motor, emotional and cognitive behavior of three animal models of PD that trigger dopaminergic (DAergic) degeneration on both brain hemispheres: (i) the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 8 or 6 \u03bcg) lesion model; (ii) the paraquat (PQ) induced model, and (iii) a genetic model based on \u03b1-synuclein overexpression (\u03b1-syn). 6-OHDA and \u03b1-syn vector were injected bilaterally in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of adult male Wistar rats; as for PQ delivery, micro-osmotic pumps were implanted in the interscapular region. Motor deficits were observed in all models, with histological analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells in the SNpc revealing a significant loss of DAergic neurons in all animal models. In addition, the \u03b1-syn animal model also presented a reduction in exploratory activity, and the 6-OHDA and PQ animals displayed a significant increase in both depressive- and anxiety-like behavior. Interestingly, cognitive impairment (working memory) was only observed in the 6-OHDA model. Overall, these PD models are suitable for mimicking the motor symptoms associated to PD, with each encompassing other relevant NMS components of the disorder that may prove beneficial for further studies in PD.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both idiopathic and familial Parkinson's disease (PD). Dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra exhibit autonomous pacemaking activity to maintain an optimal dopamine concentration in the striatum, resulting in the activation of energy metabolism. ATP production in neuronal cells is dependent on mitochondrial glucose oxidation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production associated with neuronal activation might be a major cause of mitochondrial damage in dopamine neurons. Alpha-synuclein, a major component of Lewy bodies, induces mitochondrial damage, and several genes responsible for familial PD encode molecules necessary for normal mitochondrial function. In addition, the auto-oxidation of dopamine produces dopamine quoinone and ROS. Astroglia provide neurons with lactate produced from glucose via glycolysis in response to neuronal activation. The co-activation of the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP), a shunt pathway of glycolysis, in astroglia plays a pivotal role in protecting neurons against ROS with glutathione peroxidase and the reduced form of glutathione (GSH). In addition to the allosteric regulation of the PPP, which is associated with the activation of glycolysis, the PPP in astroglia can also be activated by ROS through the Kelch-like enoyl-CoA hydratase-associated protein 1 (Keap1)/nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45 subunit-related factor 2 (Nrf2) system. A rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), is transcriptionally regulated by the Keap1/Nrf2 system, which is a master regulator of phase 2 detoxifying enzymes. ROS is thought to modify the thiol residue of Keap1 and to facilitate Nrf2 dissociation from Keap1. Thereafter, Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus where it induces the transcription of G6PDH. The pharmacological activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 PPP in astroglia may provide a novel strategy for preventing the onset and progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "The \"proteinopathy\" hypothesis, which states that pathological inclusions result in neuronal death, is classically invoked to explain neurodegeneration. In this review on \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S), attention is shifted to the distal axons, where \u03b1S deposits earlier than in the cytoplasmic formation of Lewy bodies (LBs). Because LBs are preferentially formed in axons with abundant branching, hyperbranching may accentuate axonal degeneration and \u03b1S deposition in their distal ends. This hyperbranching may also explain why motor/non-motor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD) are so generalized and diffuse with barely any localizing value. Such underlying structure templates both the distal-dominant degeneration with \u03b1S deposition, and the non-localizing nature of clinical manifestations of PD, and as such can be considered a \"structural template\" thereof. The evolution of PD symptoms can be highly variable, ranging from restricted LB lesions and corresponding, long-lived, symptoms (pure autonomic failure, cardiac denervation, essential tremor, and REM-related behavioral disorders, which may be collectively called \"focal LB disease\") to the more haphazard appearance of dementia or anosmia without developing parkinsonism or brainstem lesions. This variability is better explained by the parallel involvement of multiple systems with hyperbranching axons rather than the stereotyped upward spread of LB in the brainstem. Awareness of presynaptic dysfunctions of these hyperbranching systems may enhance the sensitivity and specificity of clinical diagnoses of PD for earlier therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa is effective for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), but is associated with motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. Many patients require add-on therapy to improve motor fluctuations without exacerbating dyskinesia. The objective of this Phase III, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of safinamide, an \u03b1-aminoamide with dopaminergic and nondopaminergic mechanisms, as add-on to l-dopa in the treatment of patients with PD and motor fluctuations. Patients were randomized to oral safinamide 100 mg/day (n\u2009=\u2009224), 50 mg/day (n\u2009=\u2009223), or placebo (n\u2009=\u2009222) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was total on time with no or nontroublesome dyskinesia (assessed using the Hauser patient diaries). Secondary endpoints included off time, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III (motor) scores, and Clinical Global Impression-Change (CGI-C). At week 24, mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD increases in total on time with no or nontroublesome dyskinesia were 1.36\u2009\u00b1\u20092.625 hours for safinamide 100 mg/day, 1.37\u2009\u00b1\u20092.745 hours for safinamide 50 mg/day, and 0.97\u2009\u00b1\u20092.375 hours for placebo. Least squares means differences in both safinamide groups were significantly higher versus placebo. Improvements in off time, UPDRS Part III, and CGI-C were significantly greater in both safinamide groups versus placebo. There were no significant between-group differences for incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) or TEAEs leading to discontinuation. The addition of safinamide 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day to l-dopa in patients with PD and motor fluctuations significantly increased total on time with no or nontroublesome dyskinesia, decreased off time, and improved parkinsonism, indicating that safinamide improves motor symptoms and parkinsonism without worsening dyskinesia.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease is a progressive neurological condition characterized by slowness and paucity of movement (bradykinesia), muscle rigidity, resting tremors, and disordered posture. The onset is typically in the 6th or 7th decade of life with slow progression to akinesia, severe tremors, physical disability and death within 10 to 25 years of initial symptoms. Parkinson disease is common and affects approximately 1% of Americans above the age of 60 years. The cause of Parkinson disease is unknown, but is marked by loss of dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the brainstem and loss of normal dopaminergic neurotransmission. Therapy of Parkinson disease continues to evolve and has resulted in improved quality of life and survival. The initial agents used for Parkinson disease were anticholinergic agents including trihexyphenidyl (Artane, Trihexy: 1949), benztropine (Cogentin: 1954), and biperiden (Akineton: 1959); their mechanism of action in Parkinsonism is not completely clear. With the increased understanding of the role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of Parkinsonism, agents that directly or indirectly affect dopaminergic transmission have been developed that have resulted in marked improvements in the management of symptoms of Parkinson disease. Levodopa (L-DOPA: 1970) is a metabolic precursor of dopamine and is the single most effective agent for Parkinson disease. It is usually combined with carbidopa (Sinemet: 1975), which increases the drug levels and half life of levodopa by inhibiting the amino acid decarboxylase that metabolizes levodopa peripherally. Dopaminergic receptor agonists are also beneficial in Parkinson disease and are often combined with levodopa/carbidopa. Dopamine receptor agonists currently available include bromocriptine (1978: Parlodel), pergolide (Permax: 1988), apomorphine (Apokyn: 2004) and more selective agonists for the D2 class of dopamine receptors \u2013 ropinirole (Requip: 1997), pramipexole (Mirapex: 1997) and rotigotine (Neupro which is formulated in a transdermal patch: 2007). More recently, inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) have been developed that block the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of dopamine; these agents include tolcapone (Tasmar: 1998), entacapone (Comtan: 2003), and opicapone (Ongentys: 2020). Dopamine is also metabolized by the monoamine oxidases and selegiline (Atapryl: 2006) and rasagiline (Azilect: 2007), which are specific inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B and are used as adjunctive therapy with levodopa in the management of Parkinson disease. Amantadine (Symmetrel: 1987) also has activity in Parkinson disease, perhaps through stimulation of release of dopamine in the substantial nigra. It is discussed separately as an anti-influenza agent. Istradefylline (Nourianz: 2019) is a new class of anti-Parkinson agents that is an antagonist of the adenosine 2A (A",

    "abstract": "The risk for malignant melanoma is higher than expected in Parkinson's disease (PD). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Exploratory Trials in PD (NET-PD) Long-term Study 1 (LS-1) trial is a contemporary phase 3 study of subjects with early, treated PD. The objective of this work was to assess the incidence of malignant melanoma in a PD cohort.\nIncident melanoma cases were identified from the adverse events log. The expected number of cases was calculated, using the expected incidence rates and the number of person-years.\nA total of 618 females and 1119 males were followed for 6452 person-years; 19 new melanoma cases were observed. The expected number was 5.29. The standardized event ratio compared to the general population was 3.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.2-5.6).\nThe risk for developing melanoma was higher than expected in the NET-PD LS-1 cohort and was similar to the risk reported in earlier comparable clinical trial cohorts. Dermatologic screening may be useful in Parkinson's disease to identify melanoma at an early stage.",

    "abstract": "This study first showed the behavioural benefits of novel combination therapy of L-dopa with acupuncture on Parkinson's disease, and its underlying mechanisms within basal ganglia. The previous study reported that acupuncture may improve the motor function of a Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model by increasing the dopamine efflux and turnover ratio of dopamine. Hence, we hypothesised that combining L-dopa with acupuncture would have a behavioural benefit for those with PD. We performed unilateral injections of 6-OHDA into the striatum of C57Bl/6 mice to model hemi-Parkinsonian attributes. To test motor function and dyskinetic anomalies, we examined cylinder behaviour and abnormal involuntary movement (AIM), respectively. We found that (1) a 50% reduced dose of L-dopa (7.5 mg/kg) combined with acupuncture showed an improvement in motor function that was comparable to mice given the standard dose of L-dopa treatment (15 mg/kg) only, and that (2) the combination treatment (L-dopa +acupuncture) was significantly superior in reducing AIM scores when equivalent doses of L-dopa were used. The combination treatment also significantly reduces the abnormal increase of GABA contents in the substantia nigra compared to the standard L-dopa treatment. Furthermore, abnormal expression of FosB, the immediate early gene of L-dopa induced dyskinesia (LID), was mitigated in the striatum by the combination treatment. All of these results indicate that acupuncture enhances the benefits of L-dopa on motor function with reduced dose of L-dopa and alleviating LID by normalising neurochemical imbalance within the basal ganglia.",

    "abstract": "The administration of anesthetics determines depression of the central nervous system and general anesthesia by inhalation may cause an environmental pollution of the operating rooms. It may therefore conceive a possible occupational etiology of Parkinson's Disease (PD).\nIn a Caucasian male aged 59 years, PD was diagnosed by brain scans with a presynaptic radioactive tracer of the dopaminergic system. Family history was negative for Parkinson's disease or essential tremor. He was a smoker, a moderate consumer of coffee and alcohol, and never exposed to pesticides/metals. For 30 years (since the age of 29 until today), he worked as an anesthesiologist in private clinics in the Veneto (Northern Italy), exposed to anesthetic gases. The time elapsed from first exposure to onset of disease is 22 years, fulfilling the requirement of the induction/latency period. A literature search demonstrated unacceptable levels of anesthetic gases in public hospitals of the Veneto region from 1990 to 1999. This exposure was presumably high also in private hospitals of the region until at least 2007, when an overexposure to sevoflurane was repeatedly measured in this patient. The association between occupational exposure to anesthetic gases and risk of Parkinson's disease was supported by a case-control study (reporting a two-fold increase in the risk of PD associated with a clinical history of general anesthesia) and a cohort study comparing mortality from PD between US anesthesiologists and internists (showing a statistically significant excess (p=0.01) in anesthesiologists compared to internists). Numerous recent mechanistic studies (in vitro essays and in vivo short-term studies) strengthened the association between exposure to anesthetic gases (nitrous oxide, halothane, isoflurane, levoflurane) and PD.\nIn view of the limited evidence of human studies and the sufficient evidence of experimental studies, the high exposure to anesthetic gases could have induced PD in the subject under study.",

    "abstract": "The care needs of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) are poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the factors that precipitate entry to institutional care, and on-going care needs once in care, within a representative cohort of community-dwelling people with PD.\nAll people with idiopathic PD, Parkinson's plus syndromes and vascular parkinsonism under the care of the Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust PD service who were living in care homes on 1 January 2013 were included. Disease severity (Hoehn and Yahr stage) and demographic data were collected. Admissions to hospital over the previous 2 years and in the year before institutional care admission were documented.\nA total of 90 patients (51 females) with a mean age of 81.3 years were included. During care home stay, the median number of emergency department attendances, the median number of hospital admissions and the median length of stay for those admitted per year were significantly lower than before care home admission. Both before care home admission and during care home stay, falls were the most common diagnoses in people attending emergency departments, with 32 of 65 (49.2%) admissions before and 34 of 59 (57.6%) admissions during care home stay having falls recorded as a cause of attendance.\nHospital attendances and admissions were relatively common, even after institutional care home placement. Events precipitating admission, such as falls, might be preventable. PD nurse specialists could be an effective way to help train staff in homes where someone is known to have PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial movement disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have nominated over fifteen distinct loci associated with risk of PD, however the biological mechanisms by which these loci influence disease risk are mostly unknown. GWAS are only the first step in the identification of disease genes: the specific causal variants responsible for the risk within the associated loci and the interactions between them must be identified to fully comprehend their impact on the development of PD. In the present study, we first attempted to replicate the association signals of 17 PD GWAS loci in our series of 1381 patients with PD and 1328 controls. BST1, SNCA, HLA-DRA, CCDC62/HIP1R and MAPT all showed a significant association with PD under different models of inheritance and LRRK2 showed a suggestive association. We then examined the role of coding LRRK2 variants in the GWAS association signal for that gene. The previously identified LRRK2 risk mutant p.M1646T and protective haplotype p.N551K-R1398H-K1423K did not explain the association signal of LRRK2 in our series. Finally, we investigated the gene-gene interaction between PARK16 and LRRK2 that has previously been proposed. We observed no interaction between PARK16 and LRRK2 GWAS variants, but did observe a non-significant trend toward interaction between PARK16 and LRRK2 variants within the protective haplotype. Identification of causal variants and the interactions between them is the crucial next step in making biological sense of the massive amount of data generated by GWAS studies. Future studies combining larger sample sizes will undoubtedly shed light on the complex molecular interplay leading to the development of PD.",

    "abstract": "The clinical features of the genetically determined forms of familial Parkinson's disease (PD) have been described in multiple reports, but there have been few comparative neuropathologic studies. Five familial PD cases, with mutations in SNCA, were matched for age, sex, and Alzheimer type pathology with sporadic PD cases. Immunohistochemistry for phospho-tau and \u03b1-synuclein was performed in 8 brain regions. The frequency of tau pathology and the morphologic features of \u03b1-synuclein pathology in familial PD were compared with sporadic PD using semi-quantitative methods. In familial PD, there were significantly more tau positive extra-perikaryal spheroid-like and thread-like lesions than in the sporadic PD. There was no significant difference in the amount of \u03b1-synuclein positive neuronal perikaryal pathology between familial PD and sporadic PD, but \u03b1-synuclein positive oligodendroglial and neuritic lesions were significantly greater in familial PD compared to sporadic PD. In the substantia nigra, familial PD had more marked neuronal loss and fewer residential neurons with Lewy bodies than the sporadic PD, suggesting a close relationship between the severity of neuronal loss and Lewy body formation. The results show a diversity of pathological features of genetically determined familial PD, and they draw attention to the possible role of tau protein in neurodegeneration. Moreover, the presence of oligodendroglial inclusions at the light and electron microscopic levels in familial PD suggests that PD and multiple system atrophy form a continuum of \u03b1-synuclein pathology.",

    "abstract": "Nobiletin, a polymethoxylated flavonoid found in citrus fruit peel, reportedly improves memory impairment in rodent models. Here we report its effect on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced motor and cognitive deficits. Nobiletin administration (50mg/kg i.p.) for 2 consecutive weeks improved motor deficits seen in MPTP-induced Parkinson model mice by 2weeks, an effect that continued until 2weeks after drug withdrawal. Drug treatment promoted similar rescue of MPTP-induced cognitive impairment at equivalent time points. Nonetheless, nobiletin treatment did not block loss of dopaminergic neurons seen in the MPTP-treated mouse midbrain, nor did it rescue decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein levels seen in the striatum or hippocampal CA1 region of these mice. Interestingly, nobiletin administration (50mg/kg i.p.) rescued reduced levels of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) autophosphorylation and phosphorylation at Thr-34 of dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein-32 (DARPP-32) in striatum and hippocampal CA1 to levels seen in sham-operated mice. Likewise, CaMKII- and cAMP kinase-dependent TH phosphorylation was significantly restored by nobiletin treatment. MPTP-induced reduction of dopamine contents in the striatum and hippocampal CA1 region was improved by nobiletin administration (50mg/kg i.p.). Acute intraperitoneal administration of nobiletin also enhanced dopamine release in striatum and hippocampal CA1, an effect partially inhibited by treatment with nifedipine (a L-type Ca(2+) channel inhibitor) or NNC 55-0396 (a T-type Ca(2+) channel inhibitor) and completely abolished by combined treatment with both. Overall, our study describes a novel nobiletin activity in brain and suggests that nobiletin rescues motor and cognitive dysfunction in MPTP-induced Parkinson model mice, in part by enhancing dopamine release.",

    "abstract": "Exercise has been shown to be beneficial for Parkinson's disease (PD). A major interest in our lab has been to investigate how exercise modulates basal ganglia function and modifies disease progression. Dopamine (DA) depletion leads to loss of dendritic spines within the caudate nucleus and putamen (striatum) in PD and its animal models and contributes to motor impairments. Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) can be delineated into two populations, the dopamine D1 receptor (DA-D1R)-containing MSNs of the direct pathway and dopamine D2 receptor (DA-D2R)-containing MSNs of the indirect pathway. There is evidence to suggest that the DA-D2R-indirect pathway MSNs may be preferentially affected after DA-depletion with a predominate loss of dendritic spine density when compared to MSNs of the DA-D1R-direct pathway in rodents; however, others have reported that both pathways may be affected in primates. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of intensive exercise on dendritic spine density and arborization in MSNs of these two pathways in the MPTP mouse model of PD. We found that MPTP led to a decrease in dendritic spine density in both DA-D1R- and DA-D2R-containing MSNs and 30 days of intensive treadmill exercise led to increased dendritic spine density and arborization in MSNs of both pathways. In addition, exercise increased the expression of synaptic proteins PSD-95 and synaptophysin. Taken together these findings support the potential effect of exercise in modifying synaptic connectivity within the DA-depleted striatum and in modifying disease progression in individuals with PD.",

    "abstract": "Panax ginseng has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Among its various benefits is a pluripotent targeting of the various events involved in neuronal cell death. This includes anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects. Indeed, ginseng extract and its individual ginsenosides have been demonstrated to influence a number of biochemical markers implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. We have reported previously that administration of the ginseng extract, G115, afforded robust neuroprotection in two rodent models of PD. However, these traditional rodent models are acute in nature and do accurately recapitulate the progressive nature of the disease. Chronic exposure to the dietary phytosterol glucoside, \u03b2-sitosterol \u03b2-d-glucoside (BSSG) triggers the progressive development of neurological deficits, with behavioral and cellular features that closely approximate those observed in PD patients. Clinical signs and histopathology continue to develop for several months following cessation of exposure to the neurotoxic insult. Here, we utilized this model to further characterize the neuroprotective effects of the ginseng extract, G115. Oral administration of this extract significantly reduced dopaminergic cell loss, microgliosis, and accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates. Further, G115 administration fully prevented the development of locomotor deficits, in the form of reduced locomotor activity and coordination. These results suggest that ginseng extract may be a potential neuroprotective therapy for the treatment of PD.",

The Spectralis OCT system was used to automatically segment all retinal layers in a parafoveal scan using the new segmentation application prototype. Mean thickness of each layer was calculated and compared between Parkinson disease patients and healthy subjects, and between Parkinson disease patients with disease durations of less than or at least 10 years. A correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the association between retinal layer thickness, duration of disease, and Parkinson disease severity. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the most sensitive layer for predicting axonal atrophy.\nParkinson disease patients showed statistically significant reduced thickness in the retinal nerve fiber, ganglion cell, inner plexiform, and outer plexiform layers and increased thickness in the inner nuclear layer compared with healthy subjects (P < .05). The inner retinal layers were more affected in Parkinson disease patients with long disease duration. The ganglion cell layer thickness was inversely correlated with disease duration and Parkinson disease severity, and was predictive of axonal damage in Parkinson disease patients.\nThe segmentation application of the Spectralis OCT revealed retinal layer atrophy in Parkinson disease patients, especially in the inner layers of patients with long disease duration. Ganglion cell layer reduction was associated with increased axonal damage.",

    "abstract": "Numerous factors contribute to the death of substantia nigra (SN) dopamine (DA) neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Compelling evidence implicates mitochondrial deficiency, oxidative stress, and inflammation as important pathogenic factors in PD. Chronic exposure of rats to rotenone causes a PD-like syndrome, in part by causing oxidative damage and inflammation in substantia nigra. Pomegranate juice (PJ) has the greatest composite antioxidant potency index among beverages, and it has been demonstrated to have protective effects in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease. The present study was designed to examine the potential neuroprotective effects of PJ in the rotenone model of PD. Oral administration of PJ did not mitigate or prevent experimental PD but instead increased nigrostriatal terminal depletion, DA neuron loss, the inflammatory response, and caspase activation, thereby heightening neurodegeneration. The mechanisms underlying this effect are uncertain, but the finding that PJ per se enhanced nitrotyrosine, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and activated caspase-3 expression in nigral DA neurons is consistent with its potential pro-oxidant activity.",

    "abstract": "We compared the rate of epilepsy and status epilepticus (SE) in patients with and without Parkinson's disease (PD). Out of 1215 patients with idiopathic PD, 31 had epilepsy and 19 of these had at least one episode of SE (61.3%) compared to 298 of 2537 patients (11.7%; p<0.001) with epilepsy and without concomitant PD. This clinical finding supports the hypothesis that the functional impairment of the basal ganglia in PD patients makes SE more likely.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is common in long term care (LTC) facilities. The number of institutionalized patients with PD will rise sharply in the coming decades because of 2 concurrent phenomena: aging of the population leads to an increased PD prevalence and improved quality of care has led to a prolonged survival in advanced disease stages. Only a few studies have investigated the prevalence and clinical characteristics of patients with PD in LTC facilities. Even fewer studies have addressed the treatment strategies used to support these institutionalized patients, who are mostly in advanced stages of the disease. The available evidence suggests that current management of patients with PD in LTC facilities is less than optimal. In the Netherlands, and we suspect in many other countries, there are no formal guidelines for treating patients with PD who have been admitted to a LTC facility. In this review, we describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and clinical management of patients with PD in LTC settings. We also address potentially modifiable elements of care and provide several recommendations to improve the management of PD in these facilities. We conclude by suggesting a possible guide for future research in this area.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol has been suggested to be either protective of, or not associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, experimental animal studies indicate that chronic heavy alcohol consumption may have dopamine neurotoxic effects relevant for PD. We studied the association between diagnosed alcohol use disorders and PD.\nAll individuals in Sweden admitted with a diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder or appendicitis (reference group) between January 1, 1972 and December 31, 2008 were identified through the Swedish National Inpatient Register, and followed for up to 37\u00a0years for a diagnosis of PD. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and adjusted for age and sex.\nWe found 1,741 (0.3%) cases of PD in the cohort of 602,930 individuals, 1,083 (0.4%) among those admitted with an alcohol use disorder and 658 (0.2%) of the individuals admitted with appendicitis. The mean follow-up time was 13.6 and 17.1\u00a0years, respectively. The HR for PD associated with an alcohol use disorder was 1.38 (CI 1.25-1.53) adjusted for age and sex. When the risk was estimated in age groups for first hospital admission with PD the highest risk was observed in the lowest age group, \u226444, HR 2.39 (0.96-5.93), adjusted for age at exposure and sex.\nA history of an alcohol use disorder conferred an increased risk of admission with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in both women and men.

    "abstract": "Changes in protein metabolism are key to disease onset and progression in many neurodegenerative diseases. As a prime example, in Parkinson's disease, folding, post-translational modification and recycling of the synaptic protein \u03b1-synuclein are clearly altered, leading to a progressive accumulation of pathogenic protein species and the formation of intracellular inclusion bodies. Altered protein folding is one of the first steps of an increasingly understood cascade in which \u03b1-synuclein forms complex oligomers and finally distinct protein aggregates, termed Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. In neurons, an elaborated network of chaperone and co-chaperone proteins is instrumental in mediating protein folding and re-folding. In addition to their direct influence on client proteins, chaperones interact with protein degradation pathways such as the ubiquitin-proteasome-system or autophagy in order to ensure the effective removal of irreversibly misfolded and potentially pathogenic proteins. Because of the vital role of proper protein folding for protein homeostasis, a growing number of studies have evaluated the contribution of chaperone proteins to neurodegeneration. We herein review our current understanding of the involvement of chaperones, co-chaperones and chaperone-mediated autophagy in synucleinopathies with a focus on the Hsp90 and Hsp70 chaperone system. We discuss genetic and pathological studies in Parkinson's disease as well as experimental studies in models of synucleinopathies that explore molecular chaperones and protein degradation pathways as a novel therapeutic target. To this end, we examine the capacity of chaperones to prevent or modulate neurodegeneration and summarize the current progress in models of Parkinson's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Although the first mutation associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) was identified several years ago in the alpha-synuclein (SNCA) gene in families of Greek and Italian ancestry, a more systematic study of this and other known PD mutations has not been performed in the Greek population.\nA genetic analysis in 111 familial or sporadic with early-onset (\u226450\u00a0years, EO) PD patients was performed for the presence of the A53T SNCA mutation. In separate subgroups of these patients, further mutations in the SNCA, LRRK2, Parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1 genes were searched for. Additionally, a subgroup of familial cases was analysed for mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene.\nIn total, five patients (4.5% of our whole population) were identified with the A53T SNCA mutation, two with a heterozygote dosage mutation and one with a heterozygote point mutation in the Parkin gene, and seven patients (10.3% of our familial cohort) with GBA gene mutations.\nThe A53T mutation in the SNCA gene, although uncommon, does represent a cause of PD in the Greek population, especially of familial EOPD with autosomal dominant inheritance. GBA mutations in the familial cohort tested here were as common as in a cohort of sporadic cases previously examined from the same centres. For the remainder of the genes, genetic defects that could definitively account for the disease were not identified. These results suggest that further Mendelian traits that lead to PD in the Greek population remain to be identified.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine agonists (DAs) are generally considered to be deprived of the highly dyskinetic effect of levodopa in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, the risk for dyskinesia induced by DA monotherapy and the contribution of clinically significant factors in the development of this disorder have never been systematically assessed.\nA systematic literature search was conducted for randomized, levodopa-controlled trials of DAs in early PD. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate the combined odds ratio (OR) for dyskinesia. Meta-regressions were subsequently performed on dyskinesia OR including individually as covariates the effects of mean disease duration, treatment duration and DA dose. In an additional analysis the effect of adjunct levodopa on the odds for dyskinesia was investigated.\nDA monotherapy resulted in an 87% lower risk for dyskinesia compared with treatment with levodopa (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.13, 95% confidence interval\u00a00.09-0.19, P <\u00a00.001). The risk for dyskinesia was independent of the dose of DA, disease duration and treatment duration. A dose-related pattern was revealed between adjunct levodopa in the DA group and dyskinesia. Nevertheless, the odds for dyskinesia in the DA group were constantly lower than in the levodopa group.\nInitial DA treatment encompasses a lower risk for dyskinesia even after the unavoidable introduction of levodopa that increases the risk for dyskinesia in a dose-related manner. As the dose and treatment duration with DAs are factors independent of the risk of dyskinesia, monotherapy with DAs in early PD is suggested at doses that ensure efficacy and delay the need for levodopa, always following an adequate evaluation of the risks DAs can pose in individual patients.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) infusion is nowadays becoming an established therapeutic option for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with fluctuating symptoms unresponsive to conventional oral treatment. As the implementation of LCIG therapy is increasing, there is a need for safety and efficacy data from current clinical practice.\nAll PD patients treated with LCIG at our centre over a 7-year period were analysed to determine the duration of treatment, retention rate, reasons for discontinuation, LCIG efficacy in motor complications, modifications of concomitant therapy and adverse events.\nOf the 59 patients, seven subjects (12%) died of causes unrelated to LCIG infusion and 11 patients (19%) discontinued therapy prior to the cut-off date. Duodopa improved motor complications and over 90% of patients reported an improvement in their quality of life, autonomy and clinical global status. The most common adverse events were dislocation and kinking of the intestinal tube.\nLCIG infusion is effective for the long-term treatment of advanced PD patients and exerts a positive and clinically significant effect on motor complications with a relatively low dropout rate.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease, a loss of dopamine neurons causes severe motor impairments. These motor impairments have long been thought to result exclusively from immediate effects of dopamine loss on neuronal firing in basal ganglia, causing imbalances of basal ganglia pathways. However, motor impairments and pathway imbalances may also result from dysfunctional synaptic plasticity - a novel concept of how Parkinsonian symptoms evolve. Here we built a neuro-computational model that allows us to simulate the effects of dopamine loss on synaptic plasticity in basal ganglia. Our simulations confirm that dysfunctional synaptic plasticity can indeed explain the emergence of both motor impairments and pathway imbalances in Parkinson's disease, thus corroborating the novel concept. By predicting that dysfunctional plasticity results not only in reduced activation of desired responses, but also in their active inhibition, our simulations provide novel testable predictions. When simulating dopamine replacement therapy (which is a standard treatment in clinical practice), we observe a new balance of pathway outputs, rather than a simple restoration of non-Parkinsonian states. In addition, high doses of replacement are shown to result in overshooting motor activity, in line with empirical evidence. Finally, our simulations provide an explanation for the intensely debated paradox that focused basal ganglia lesions alleviate Parkinsonian symptoms, but do not impair performance in healthy animals. Overall, our simulations suggest that the effects of dopamine loss on synaptic plasticity play an essential role in the development of Parkinsonian symptoms, thus arguing for a re-conceptualisation of Parkinsonian pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Impulsive-compulsive behaviors (ICBs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) are a common and devastating side effect of dopamine replacement therapy. In this review we describe the phenomenology, prevalence, and risk factors of patients with PD. Results of behavioral studies assessing the neuropsychological profile of patients with PD emphasize that the ICBs, which are behavioral addictions, are not hedonically motivated. Rather, other factors such as the inability to cope with uncertainty may be triggering ICBs. New insights from functional imaging studies, strengthening the incentive salience hypothesis, are discussed, and therapeutic guidelines for the management of ICBs in PD are given.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged administration of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) for Parkinson's disease (PD) is hampered by motor complications related to the progressive incapacity of residual nigrostriatal neurons to properly utilize the drug. Direct stimulation of dopaminergic (DAergic) receptors with specific compounds (DA agonists) has, therefore, become an additional therapeutic tool for PD.\nDA agonists have considerable anti-parkinsonian symptomatic efficacy, although they are less potent than l-DOPA. This review summarizes pre-clinical and clinical data on DA agonists and their role in treating PD. Specific focus was put on second-generation, first-line non-ergolinic DA agonists and their motor, non-motor and putative neuroprotective effects. The anti-parkinsonian potential of recently developed DA agonists that reached Phase II and III clinical trials was also addressed.\nDA agonists can be useful along the whole natural course of PD, as monotherapy in the initial phase or combined with l-DOPA in advanced PD. Extended-release formulations have been developed for second-generation DA agonists, which are better appreciated by patients. Neuroprotective properties have been proposed for DA agonists, based on pre-clinical studies, but never convincingly demonstrated in patients. New DA agonists, with better symptomatic efficacy and devoid of the side effects that characterize current compounds, are needed.",

    "abstract": "Expectation contributes to placebo and nocebo responses in Parkinson's disease (PD). While there is evidence for expectation-induced modulations of bradykinesia, little is known about the impact of expectation on resting tremor. Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves cardinal PD motor symptoms including tremor whereas impairment of verbal fluency (VF) has been observed as a potential side-effect. Here we investigated how expectation modulates the effect of STN-DBS on resting tremor and its interaction with VF. In a within-subject-design, expectation of 24 tremor-dominant PD patients regarding the impact of STN-DBS on motor symptoms was manipulated by verbal suggestions (positive [placebo], negative [nocebo], neutral [control]). Patients participated with (MedON) and without (MedOFF) antiparkinsonian medication. Resting tremor was recorded by accelerometry and bradykinesia of finger tapping and diadochokinesia were assessed by a 3D ultrasound motion detection system. VF was quantified by lexical and semantic tests. In a subgroup of patients, the effect of STN-DBS on tremor was modulated by expectation, i.e. tremor decreased (placebo response) or increased (nocebo response) by at least 10% as compared to the control condition while no significant effect was observed for the overall group. Interestingly, nocebo responders in MedON were additionally characterized by significant impairment in semantic verbal fluency. In contrast, bradykinesia was not affected by expectation. These results indicate that the therapeutic effect of STN-DBS on tremor can be modulated by expectation in a subgroup of patients and suggests that tremor is also among the parkinsonian symptoms responsive to placebo and nocebo interventions. While positive expectations enhanced the effect of STN-DBS by further decreasing the magnitude of tremor, negative expectations counteracted the therapeutic effect and at the same time exacerbated a side-effect often associated with STN-DBS. The present findings underscore the potency of patients' expectation and its relevance for therapeutic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Striatal transplantation of dopaminergic (DA) neurons or neural stem cells (NSCs) has been reported to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the low rate of cell survival, differentiation, and integration in the host brain limits the therapeutic efficacy. We investigated the therapeutic effects of intracranial co-transplantation of mesencephalic NSCs stably overexpressing human glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF-mNSCs) together with fetal DA neurons in the 6-OHDA rat model of PD. Striatal injection of mNSCs labeled by the contrast enhancer superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) resulted in a hypointense signal in the striatum on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images that lasted for at least 8 weeks post-injection, confirming the long-term survival of injected stem cells in vivo. Co-transplantation of GDNF-mNSCs with fetal DA neurons significantly reduced apomorphine-induced rotation, a behavioral endophenotype of PD, compared to sham-treated controls, rats injected with mNSCs expressing empty vector (control mNSCs) plus fetal DA neurons, or rats injected separately with either control mNSCs, GDNF-mNSCs, or fetal DA neurons. In addition, survival and differentiation of mNSCs into DA neurons was significantly greater following co-transplantation of GDNF-mNSCs plus fetal DA neurons compared to the other treatment groups as indicated by the greater number of cell expressing both the mNSCs lineage tracer enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and the DA neuron marker tyrosine hydroxylase. The success of cell-based therapies for PD may be greatly improved by co-transplantation of fetal DA neurons with mNSCs genetically modified to overexpress trophic factors such as GDNF that support differentiation into DA cells and their survival in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The first large-scale meta-analysis of published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) identified 5 new genetic loci (ACMSD, STK39, MCCC1/LAMP3, SYT11, and CCDC62/HIP1R). Very recently, a large-scale replication and heterogeneity study also reported that STK39 and CCDC62/HIP1R increased risk of PD in Asian and Caucasian populations. However, their roles still remain unclear in a Han Chinese population from mainland China.\nWe examined genetic associations of STK39 rs2102808 and CCDC62/HIP1R rs12817488 with PD susceptibility in a Han Chinese population of 783 PD patients and 725 controls. We also performed further stratified analyses by the age of onset and accomplished in-depth clinical characteristics analyses between the different genotypes for each locus.\nNo significant differences were observed in the minor allele frequency (MAF) among cases and controls at the two loci (STK39 rs2102808: OR\u200a=\u200a1.06, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a0.91, 1.23, P\u200a=\u200a0.467; CCDC62/HIP1R rs12817488: OR\u200a=\u200a0.88, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a0.76, 1.01, P\u200a=\u200a0.072). Subgroup analyses by the age of onset also showed no significant differences among different subgroups of the two loci. In addition, minor allele carriers cannot be distinguished from non-carriers based on their clinical features at the two loci.\nWe are unable to demonstrate the association between STK39 and CCDC62/HIP1R and PD susceptibility in a Han Chinese population from mainland China. Additional replication studies in other populations and functional studies are warranted to better validate the role of the two new loci in PD risk.",

    "abstract": "Beta-band synchronous oscillations in the dorsolateral region of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of human patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been frequently reported. However, the correlation between STN oscillations and synchronization has not been thoroughly explored. The simultaneous recordings of 2390 multi-unit pairs recorded by two parallel microelectrodes (separated by fixed distance of 2 mm, n = 72 trajectories with two electrode tracks >4 mm STN span) in 57 PD patients undergoing STN deep brain stimulation surgery were analyzed. Automatic procedures were utilized to divide the STN into dorsolateral oscillatory and ventromedial non-oscillatory regions, and to quantify the intensity of STN oscillations and synchronicity. Finally, the synchronicity of simultaneously vs. non-simultaneously recorded pairs were compared using a shuffling procedure. Synchronization was observed predominately in the beta range and only between multi-unit pairs in the dorsolateral oscillatory region (n = 615). In paired recordings between sites in the dorsolateral and ventromedial (n = 548) and ventromedial-ventromedial region pairs (n = 1227), no synchronization was observed. Oscillation and synchronicity intensity decline along the STN dorsolateral-ventromedial axis suggesting a fuzzy border between the STN regions. Synchronization strength was significantly correlated to the oscillation power, but synchronization was no longer observed following shuffling. We conclude that STN long-range beta oscillatory synchronization is due to increased neuronal coupling in the Parkinsonian brain and does not merely reflect the outcome of oscillations at similar frequency. The neural synchronization in the dorsolateral (probably the motor domain) STN probably augments the pathological changes in firing rate and patterns of subthalamic neurons in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized primarily by the selective death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. Although several genetic forms of PD have been identified, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying DA neuron loss in PD remain elusive. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been recognized as potent post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression with fundamental roles in numerous biological processes. Although their role in PD pathogenesis is still a very active area of investigation, several seminal studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of the roles these small non-coding RNAs play in the disease process. Among these are studies which have demonstrated specific miRNAs that target and down-regulate the expression of PD-related genes as well as those demonstrating a reciprocal relationship in which PD-related genes act to regulate miRNA processing machinery. Concurrently, a wealth of knowledge has become available regarding the molecular mechanisms that unify the underlying etiology of genetic and sporadic PD pathogenesis, including dysregulated protein quality control by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy pathway, activation of programmed cell death, mitochondrial damage and aberrant DA neurodevelopment and maintenance. Following a discussion of the interactions between PD-related genes and miRNAs, this review highlights those studies which have elucidated the roles of these pathways in PD pathogenesis. We highlight the potential of miRNAs to serve a critical regulatory role in the implicated disease pathways, given their capacity to modulate the expression of entire families of related genes. Although few studies have directly linked miRNA regulation of these pathways to PD, a strong foundation for investigation has been laid and this area holds promise to reveal novel therapeutic targets for PD.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that glutamatergic system hyperactivity may be related to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT1-3) import glutamate into synaptic vesicles and are key anatomical and functional markers of glutamatergic excitatory transmission. Both VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 have been identified as definitive markers of glutamatergic neurons, but VGLUT 3 is also expressed by non glutamatergic neurons. VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are thought to be expressed in a complementary manner in the cortex and the thalamus (VL/VM), in glutamatergic neurons involved in different physiological functions. Chronic high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is the neurosurgical therapy of choice for the management of motor deficits in patients with advanced PD. STN-HFS is highly effective, but its mechanisms of action remain unclear. This study examines the effect of STN-HFS on VGLUT1-3 expression in different brain nuclei involved in motor circuits, namely the basal ganglia (BG) network, in normal and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rats.\nHere we report that: 1) Dopamine(DA)-depletion did not affect VGLUT1 and VGLUT3 expression but significantly decreased that of VGLUT2 in almost all BG structures studied; 2) STN-HFS did not change VGLUT1-3 expression in the different brain areas of normal rats while, on the contrary, it systematically induced a significant increase of their expression in DA-depleted rats and 3) STN-HFS reversed the decrease in VGLUT2 expression induced by the DA-depletion.\nThese results show for the first time a comparative analysis of changes of expression for the three VGLUTs induced by STN-HFS in the BG network of normal and hemiparkinsonian rats. They provide evidence for the involvement of VGLUT2 in the modulation of BG cicuits and in particular that of thalamostriatal and thalamocortical pathways suggesting their key role in its therapeutic effects for alleviating PD motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is a neurotrophic factor widely expressed in the central nervous system including the basal ganglia, limbic system and hypothalamus. Nothing is known of CNP's role in the human brain but in rodents CNP promotes axon growth and branching, and interacts with dopaminergic function in models of addiction. Because preliminary evidence showed reduced levels in Parkinson's disease (PD), we examined concentrations of CNP peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 146 PD patients from the DATATOP study to determine changes over time in relation to medication status and cognitive function. CNP and an aminoterminal product of proCNP (NTproCNP) were measured in extracts from stored CSF by radioimmunoassay. CSF samples were obtained twice-at enrolment and at the study's endpoint (requirement for levodopa treatment) after treatment with placebo or deprenyl. At enrolment, median baseline concentration of CSF NTproCNP (776\u00a0pmol/L, n\u00a0=\u00a0146) was significantly lower than that in a reference group without neurological disorder (1,010\u00a0pmol/L, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Concentrations declined significantly during placebo (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and lower values at enrolment were associated with more rapid functional decline (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In contrast, deprenyl-a treatment which delayed the need for levodopa-nullified the time-dependent decline in CSF NTproCNP. In conclusion subnormal CSF NTproCNP which declines with time and associates with increasing functional disability implicates CNP in PD. Concordant clinical and peptide responses to deprenyl suggest that some of the benefits of monoamine oxidase inhibitors in PD are mediated by preserving tissue CNP activity.",

    "abstract": "Apathy is one of the most common behavioral disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD) with a reported prevalence of 17-51 %. Apathy has been associated with depression, cognitive deficits, and poor quality of life. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of apathy in Mexican subjects with PD and its correlation with clinical and demographic characteristics. A cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytic study was carried out. Consecutive subjects with PD attending the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery in Mexico City were included. Demographic and other relevant clinical data were collected. The Apathy Scale was applied to all subjects. A cut-off score of \u2265 14 was used. A total of 241 non-demented patients (52.7 % male) were included. Apathy was found in 43 % of subjects. Lower body mass index, older age of PD onset, cognitive decline and disease severity were all related to apathy. The use of dopamine agonists or rasagiline was more common in patients with low apathy scores. Our results show that the prevalence of apathy in Mexican subjects with PD is similar to other reports.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and freezing of gait (FOG) (freezers) demonstrate high gait variability. The objective of this study was to determine whether freezers display a higher variability of upper limb movements and elucidate if these changes correlate with gait. We were the first group to compare directly objectively measured gait and upper limb movement variability of freezers between freezing episodes. Patients with objectively verified FOG (n\u00a0=\u00a011) and PD patients without FOG (non-freezers) (n\u00a0=\u00a011) in a non-randomized medication condition (OFF/ON) were analyzed. Uncued antiphasic finger tapping and forearm diadochokinetic movements were analyzed via three-dimensional ultrasound kinematic measurements. Gait variability of straight gait was assessed using ground reaction forces. Freezers had shorter stride length (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and higher stride length variability (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) in the medication OFF condition. Movement variability was not different during finger tapping or diadochokinesia between the groups. There was a trend towards more freezing of the upper limb during finger tapping for the freezers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07). Variability in stride length generation and stride timing was not associated with variability of upper limb movement in freezers. Our findings demonstrate that: (1) freezers have a higher spatial gait variability between freezing episodes; (2) freezing-like episodes of the upper limb occur in PD patients, and tend to be more pronounced among freezers than non-freezers for finger tapping; (3) spatial and temporal upper extremity variability is equally affected in freezers and non-freezers in an uncued task. Upper limb freezing is not correlated to lower limb freezing, implicating a different pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Although the etiology of PD is not completely understood, it is well-documented that oxidative stress and Ca(2+)-mediated cellular damage play important roles in the progression of PD. 2-[[(1,1-Dimethylethyl)oxidoimino]-methyl]-3,5,6-trimethylpyrazine (TBN), a novel nitrone derivative of tetramethylpyrazine, has shown significant therapeutic effects in stroke models due to its multiple functions, including calcium overload blockade and free radical-scavenging. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective and neurorescue effects of TBN on various in vitro and in vivo models of PD and explored its possible mechanisms of action. The results show that TBN exerted significant neuroprotection on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-induced damage in SH-SY5Y cells and primary dopaminergic neurons, as well as on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neuron loss in zebrafish (TBN and MPTP were added simultaneously into the fish embryo medium and the treatment period was 48\u2009h). In the MPTP-induced mouse and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat PD models, TBN administrated orally twice daily for 14\u2009d (3\u2009d post-MPTP lesion in mice and 7\u2009d post-6-OHDA lesion in rats) exhibited remarkable neurorescue effects to increase the number of dopaminergic neurons. In addition, TBN improved apomorphine-induced rotational behavior in the 6-OHDA-lesioned PD rats. TBN suppressed the MPP(+)-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SH-SY5Y cells, increased the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH) concentration in the substantial nigra of MPTP-treated mice. These data indicate that TBN protects and rescues dopaminergic neurons from MPP(+) and MPTP/6-OHDA-induced damage by reducing ROS and increasing cellular antioxidative defense capability.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have corroborated receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) ablation had a protective effect on nigral dopaminergic neurons in the MPTP model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Genetic variation of RAGE gene may be associated with the development of onset of sporadic PD. The present study aimed to explore the possible association of RAGE gene polymorphisms namely -374T/A,-429T/C, and G82S with PD. A total of 285 PD patients and 285 healthy-matched individuals in Chinese Han population were enrolled. Genotype analyses were performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Only the -429T/C polymorphism denoted a significant difference between PD patients and controls (P=0.015) of the three examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our data also revealed that -429C allele carriers seem to have a decreased risk of PD (OR=0.617, P=0.007). Moreover, there were significant differences in genotype distribution in female PD group and its healthy-matched control subgroup (P=0.014), as well as between late-onset PD (LOPD) and the controls subgroup (P=0.016). However, for -374T/A and 82GS polymorphisms, there was no significant difference in the genotype and allele frequencies between PD patients and the controls, as well as gender- and age-related differences. Our present findings indicate that the RAGE -429T/C polymorphism may be associated with the susceptibility of PD and the CC genotype of -429T/C may be a protective factor for PD in Chinese Han population.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested a relation between statin use and the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the conclusions are inconsistent. Some studies found an increased incidence of PD among statin users; others found a decreased incidence. Others showed that PD incidence was related to baseline cholesterol levels.\nTo examine the association between baseline levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), long-term statin use, and the incidence of PD.\nThe study group consisted of a historical cohort of 94,308 men and women in Israel aged 45 years or more without PD or statin use at baseline, between 2000 and 2007. PD incidence among long-term statin users was compared with that among nonusers. The cohort was divided into 4 groups according to baseline LDL-C levels, and their relative risks of developing PD were calculated with adjustment for potential confounders (sex, age, socioeconomic status, history of ischemic heart disease, hypertension, stroke, and smoking). The association between different variables was analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards model.\nDuring the study period, 1035 incident cases of PD were identified. Statin use was associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of PD (odds ratio, 0.73, 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.88; P=.001). No association was found between baseline LDL-C levels and PD risk.\nOur results provide additional evidence regarding the lower incidence of PD among statin users. These findings warrant further research regarding the possible neuroprotective role of statins in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

The genomic DNAs of 215 PD patients and 212 matched controls from the northern Han Chinese population were amplified in two independent PCR systems and subsequently genotyped by digestion with the three endonucleases (Hinf I, Nco I and Msp I ). The genetic parameters and association studies were carried out with SPSS 13.0, Haploview version 4.2 and PLINK 1.07 softwares. We detected accurately all genotypes in the five SNPs with multiplex PCR-RFLP and mismatched multiplex PCR-RFLP techniques. The genotypes of four SNPs, except for rs823083, were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The four SNPs, rs16856110, rs4951261, rs708723 and rs823076, which were in linkage equilibrium, should not be associated with PD (P-values ranging from 0.077 to 0.544). The SNPs investigated at the PARK16 locus were not found to be involved in PD-associated blocks in the northern Han Chinese population. The allele distributions of rs708723, rs4951261, rs823076 and rs16856110 in the northern Han Chinese population can be highly polymorphic, which can be applied to genetic analysis and forensic practices.",

    "abstract": "Our objectives were to perform a longitudinal assessment of mental status in early stage Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, with brief neuropsychological tests, in order to find predictive factors for cognitive decline. Sixty-one, early stage, and nondemented patients were assessed twice, over a 2-year interval, with a global cognitive test (mini-mental state examination (MMSE)) and a frontal function test (frontal assessment battery (FAB)) and motor function scales. Dementia and hallucinations were diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria. Cognitive function scores did not decrease significantly, except for FAB lexical fluency score. Four patients presented with dementia at followup. The MMSE score below cut-off, worse gait dysfunction, the nontremor motor subtype, and hallucinations were significantly related to dementia. Rigidity and speech dysfunction were related to dementia and a decrease in FAB scores. We can conclude that decline in the MMSE and FAB scores is small and heterogeneous in the early stages of PD. Scores below cut-off in the MMSE could be helpful to predict dementia. Nontremor motor deficits could be predictive factors for frontal cognitive decline and dementia.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory mechanisms have been implicated in a series of neuropsychiatric conditions, including behavioral disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, and affective disorders. Accumulating evidence also strongly suggests their involvement in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to evaluate plasma levels of inflammatory biomarkers, and their association with cognitive performance and other non-motor symptoms of PD. PD patients and control individuals were subjected to various psychometric tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). Biomarker plasma levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). PD patients exhibited worse performance on MMSE and the programming task of FAB, and presented higher soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNFR) plasma levels than control individuals. Among PD patients, increased sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 concentrations were associated with poorer cognitive test scores. After multiple linear regression, sTNFR1 and education remained a significant predictor for FAB scores. Our data suggest that PD is associated with a proinflammatory profile, and sTNFRs are putative biomarkers of cognitive performance, with elevated sTNFR1 levels predicting poorer executive functioning in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proposed as a potential treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). H-coils, inducing deeper and wider magnetic fields compared to traditional coils, may be potentially useful in PD, characterized by widespread, bilateral involvement of cortico-subcortical circuits.\nTo evaluate the safety of repetitive deep TMS (rDTMS) with H-coil as add-on treatment of motor symptoms in PD.\nTwenty-seven PD patients (aged 60.1 \u00b1 6.8 y; PD-duration: 6.3 \u00b1 2.8 y; motor-UPDRS: 39.6 \u00b1 10.1) underwent 12 rDTMS sessions over 4 weeks at excitatory (10 Hz) frequency over primary motor (M1) and bilateral prefrontal (PF) regions. Motor UPDRS off therapy was assessed before and after the last rDTMS session, together with safety records at each treatment session.\nNo drop-outs or adverse events were recorded. Motor UPDRS significantly improved after rDTMS (10.8 points average reduction; P < 0.0001).\nHigh-frequency rDTMS might be a safe treatment for PD motor symptoms. Further placebo-controlled, randomized studies are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a late-life neurodegenerative disease. Genetic and environmental factors play an etiological role. Harmane (1-methyl-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole) is a potent tremor-producing neurotoxin that shows structural resemblance to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).\nIn 2002 and 2007, we demonstrated elevated blood harmane concentrations [HA] in essential tremor (ET) cases. We now assessed whether blood [HA] were elevated in Parkinson's disease (PD) as well.\nBlood [HA] were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography. Subjects comprised 113 PD cases and 101 controls.\nMean log blood [HA] in PD cases was double that of controls (0.59\u00b10.63 g(-10)/ml vs. 0.27\u00b10.63 g(-10)/ml, p<0.001). A non-parametric test on non-transformed data (median blood [HA]=3.31 g(-10)/ml in cases and 1.44 g(-10)/ml in controls) also showed this difference (p<0.001). In unadjusted and then adjusted logistic regression analyses, log blood [HA] was associated with PD (odds ratio [OR]unadjusted 2.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.46-3.67, p<0.001; OR(adjusted) 2.54, 95% CI 1.55-4.16, p<0.001). In PD, log blood [HA] co-varied with family history, being lowest in PD cases with no family history (0.54\u00b10.60 g(-10)/ml) and highest in PD cases with a family history of both ET and PD (0.84\u00b10.68 g(-10)/ml) (p=0.06).\nBlood harmane appears to be elevated in PD. The finding needs to be reproduced in additional cohorts to assess its generalizability. The higher concentration in familial PD suggests that the mechanism may involve genetic factors.",

AD patients were diagnosed with the criteria of National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) while PDD was based upon the standards of Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Task Force. According to clinical dementia rating (CDR) score, they were divided into mild dementia (CDR score = 0.5/1) and moderate-to-severe dementia groups (CDR score = 2/3). World Health Organization-University of California, Los Angeles, auditory verbal learning test (WHO-UCLA AVLT), clock drawing test (CDT) and neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) were performed.\nNo significant difference in immediate memory, delayed memory or long-delayed recognition score was observed between PDD and AD patients (P > 0.05). CDT score was significantly lower in PDD patients (mild dementia group: 0.9 \u00b1 0.9; moderate-to-severe dementia group: 0.6 \u00b1 0.9) than that of AD patients (mild dementia group: 1.5 \u00b1 0.7, P < 0.001; moderate-to-severe dementia group: 1.1 \u00b1 0.6, P = 0.027) and this difference was more significant in mild dementia group. More than 70% of PDD patients reported at least one neuropsychiatric symptom. And also, in mild dementia group, compared with AD patients (frequency: 43.2% (16/37), NPI score = 5.7 \u00b1 11.9), a higher frequency of neuropsychiatric symptoms and higher NPI scores were observed in PDD patients (frequency: 71.40% (25/35), NPI score = 8.4 \u00b1 9.8).\nMore severe impairment in visuospatial ability and executive function was present in PDD patients compared with AD patients. And neuropsychiatric symptoms were more common and severe in PDD patients.",

    "abstract": "Unlike most other cell types, neurons preferentially metabolize glucose via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to maintain their antioxidant status. Inhibiting the PPP in neuronal cell models causes cell death. In rodents, inhibition of this pathway causes selective dopaminergic cell death leading to motor deficits resembling parkinsonism. Using postmortem human brain tissue, we characterized glucose metabolism via the PPP in sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and controls. AD brains showed increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production in areas affected by disease. In PD however, increased NADPH production was only seen in the affected areas of late-stage cases. Quantifying PPP NADPH-producing enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, showed a reduction in the putamen of early-stage PD and interestingly in the cerebellum of early and late-stage PD. Importantly, there was no decrease in enzyme levels in the cortex, putamen, or cerebellum of AD. Our results suggest that down-regulation of PPP enzymes and a failure to increase antioxidant reserve is an early event in the pathogenesis of sporadic PD.",

    "abstract": "Gait impairment is common in people with Parkinson's disease. There is a lack of effective interventions to target this debilitating complication and therefore a need to identify new therapeutic options. An underlying cholinergic deficit contributes to both the gait and cognitive dysfunction seen in Parkinson's disease. The combined impact of both impairments can be assessed in gait tasks performed with concomitant cognitive tasks. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the impact of a cholinesterase inhibitor on cognitive function and gait performance in people with established Parkinson's disease.\nThis is a single centre, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial in 130 people with Hoehn and Yahr stage 2-3 idiopathic Parkinson's disease who have fallen in the past year. Participants will be randomised to two groups, receiving either rivastigmine capsules or identical placebo capsules for 8\u00a0months. Assessment will be undertaken at baseline and at the end of medication prescription (i.e. 8\u00a0months) with participants remaining enrolled in the trial for a further 4\u00a0months to monitor for falls and adverse events. The primary outcome is step time variability, assessed with and without the addition of concurrent cognitive tasks. Secondary outcomes will include other gait parameters, sensorimotor and balance performances, cognitive indices, falls and fall related injury, fear of falling, Parkinson's symptoms and data pertaining to possible harms.\nThis randomised controlled trial will examine the effect of cholinesterase inhibitor therapy on gait, balance and falls in Parkinson's disease. If effective, it would offer a new therapeutic option to ameliorating gait and cognitive deficits in a population at high risk of falls.\nISRCTN19880883, UTN U1111-1124-0244.",

    "abstract": "The brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has available the necessary functional components to produce the active ligands angiotensins II (AngII), angiotensin III, angiotensins (IV), angiotensin (1-7), and angiotensin (3-7). These ligands interact with several receptor proteins including AT1, AT2, AT4, and Mas distributed within the central and peripheral nervous systems as well as local RASs in several organs. This review first describes the enzymatic pathways in place to synthesize these ligands and the binding characteristics of these angiotensin receptor subtypes. We next discuss current hypotheses to explain the disorders of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as research efforts focused on the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), in their treatment. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are showing promise in the treatment of several neurodegenerative pathologies; however, there is a need for the development of analogs capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier and acting as agonists or antagonists at these receptor sites. AngII and AngIV have been shown to play opposing roles regarding memory acquisition and consolidation in animal models. We discuss the development of efficacious AngIV analogs in the treatment of animal models of AD and PD. These AngIV analogs act via the AT4 receptor subtype which may coincide with the hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met receptor system. Finally, future research directions are described concerning new approaches to the treatment of these two neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "This Journal Club article looks at a study by Tessitore et al.,(1) who investigated functional connectivity (FC) within the default-mode network (DMN) in cognitively unimpaired patients with Parkinson disease (PD). PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer disease (AD) and is expected to become progressively more prevalent in our aging societies. Thus, its social and economic burden on societies is expected to be even greater in the future.(2) Cognitive impairment is one of the most disabling nonmotor symptoms of PD, further affecting functioning and quality of life, as well as increasing caregivers' burden and health-related costs.(3) When an individual is alert but not actively engaged in cognitive tasks, organized neural activity occurs in a set of brain regions called DMN (figure), which involves the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), parts of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the precuneus.(4) Interestingly, DMN abnormalities have been linked to cognitive profiles in several neurologic and psychiatric disorders, such as AD, autism, frontotemporal dementia, multiple sclerosis, and vegetative states(5); however, contradictory results have been reported in PD.(1) This study, for the first time, cogently demonstrates decreased FC within the DMN in cognitively unimpaired patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Excess glutamatergic neurotransmission may contribute to excitotoxic loss of nigrostriatal neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we determined if increasing glutamate uptake could reduce the extent of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) loss in PD progression. The beta-lactam antibiotic, ceftriaxone, increases the expression of glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1), a glutamate transporter that plays a major role in glutamate clearance in central nervous system and may attenuate adverse behavioral or neurobiological function in other neurodegenerative disease models. In association with >80% TH loss, we observed a significant decrease in glutamate uptake in the established 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) PD model. Ceftriaxone (200 mg/kg, i.p.) increased striatal glutamate uptake with >5 consecutive days of injection in nonlesioned rats and lasted out to 14 days postinjection, a time beyond that required for 6-OHDA to produce >70% TH loss (\u223c9 days). When ceftriaxone was given at the time of 6-OHDA, TH loss was \u223c57% compared to \u223c85% in temporally matched vehicle-injected controls and amphetamine-induced rotation was reduced about 2-fold. This attenuation of TH loss was associated with increased glutamate uptake, increased GLT-1 expression, and reduced Serine 19 TH phosphorylation, a calcium-dependent target specific for nigrostriatal neurons. These results reveal that glutamate uptake can be targeted in a PD model, decrease the rate of TH loss in a calcium-dependent manner, and attenuate locomotor behavior associated with 6-OHDA lesion. Given that detection of reliable PD markers will eventually be employed in susceptible populations, our results give credence to the possibility that increasing glutamate uptake may prolong the time period before locomotor impairment occurs.",

    "abstract": "Familial aggregation has been shown for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) separately, and it has been hypothesized that these diseases also coaggregate in families.\nThe authors investigated familial coaggregation of AD and PD by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed was searched for relevant studies published through the end of October 2012. Three independent investigators screened publications and extracted data. Relative risk estimates of AD risk associated with family history of PD or parkinsonism, or PD risk associated with family history of AD or dementia, were summarized into metaestimates using random effects models. Heterogeneity and publication bias were tested using Higgins' and Egger's tests, respectively.\nWe included 16 studies in the review, with 14 included in any meta-analysis. AD risk associated with family history of PD yielded a summary hazard ratio of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.00-1.39) based on 5 reconstructed cohort studies and a summary odds ratio (OR) of 1.40 (95% CI: 0.92-2.12) based on 7 case-control studies. PD risk associated with family history of AD yielded a summary OR of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.49-1.16) based on 3 studies. There was no significant heterogeneity among studies, nor significant publication bias.\nThere may be familial coaggregation of AD and PD, although the association was modest and only apparent when studying AD risk associated with family history of PD.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation and dysfunction of ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) have been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology for a long time. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) have neuro-protective effects in PD as they assist in protein refolding and targeting of irreparable proteins to UPS. To realize their benefits in a chronically progressing disease like PD, it is imperative to maintain slightly up-regulated levels of HSPs consistently over a longer period of time. Here, we evaluate the possible beneficial effects of HSP inducer carbenoxolone (cbx) in a rotenone-based rat model of PD. Simultaneously with rotenone, a low dose of cbx (20\u00a0mg/kg body weight) was administered for five weeks to male SD rats. Weekly behavioral analysis along with end-point evaluation of HSPs, UPS activity, apoptosis, and oxidative stress were performed. The activation of heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1) and up-regulation of HSP70, HSP40, and HSP27 levels in mid-brain following cbx administration resulted in the reduction of \u03b1-synuclein and ubiquitin aggregation. This decrease seems to be mediated by reduction in protein carbonylation as well as up-regulation of UPS activity. In addition, the decrease in apoptosis and oxidative stress following HSP upregulation prevented the decline in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine levels in mid-brain region, which in turn resulted in improved motor functions. Thus, persistent HSP induction at low levels by cbx could improve the PD pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Objective. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of a 12-week program of therapeutic Tai Chi on the motor function and physical function of idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients (PDs). Methods. The participants were 22 clinically stable PDs in Hoehn-Yahr stages 1-2 randomly assigned to a therapeutic Tai Chi group (TTC, N = 11) or a control group (CON, N = 9). Two subjects in control group did not complete the study for personal reasons. TTC was performed three days a week (60\u2009min/session). Motor symptoms by the UPDRS were assessed, and tests of physical function were administered before and after the 12-week trial. Results. The TTC group, as compared to the CON group, showed changes in the mentation, behavior, mood, and motor scales of the UPDRS (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, resp.), with no significant main effects on the activities of daily living scale (ADL). However, there was a significant interaction between the time and intervention group on ADL (P < 0.05). There were no significant main effects for any of the physical function variables. There were significant interaction effects in balance and agility (P < 0.05, resp.). Conclusions. This study showed that TTC training had modest positive effects on the functional status of Parkinson's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is clinically highly heterogeneous, often divided into tremor dominant (TD) and postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD). To better understand these subtypes and to help stratify patients, we applied an objective marker, i.e., an instrumented version of the traditional \"Timed Up and Go\" test (iTUG). It is not known whether the iTUG is sensitive to PD motor phenotypes or what are its behavioral and cognitive correlates. Subjects performed the iTUG wearing a body-fixed sensor. Subcomponents were studied including walking, transitions and turning. Gait, balance and cognitive function and the associations between iTUG, behavioral and cognitive domains were assessed. We also compared two representative subtypes, with minimal symptom overlap, referred to here as predominant PIGD (p-PIGD) and predominant TD (p-TD). One hundred and six patients with PD performed the iTUG. Significant correlations were found between iTUG measures and the PIGD score, but not with TD score. Thirty p-PIGD and 31 p-TD patients were identified. Both groups were similar with respect to age and disease duration (p > 0.75). The p-PIGD patients took significantly longer to complete the iTUG (p = 0.026), used more steps (p = 0.031), albeit with similar step duration (p = 0.936). In the sit-to-stand transition, the p-PIGD patients exhibited lower anterior-posterior jerk (p = 0.04) and lower pitch range (p = 0.012). During the turn, the p-PIGD patients had a lower yaw amplitude (p < 0.038). Cognitive domains were correlated with iTUG measures in the p-PIGD patients, but not in the p-TD. These findings demonstrate that a single sensor can identify axial and cognitive correlates using subcomponents of the iTUG and reveals subtle alterations between the PD motor subtypes.",

    "abstract": "A rostral brainstem structure, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), is severely affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology and is regarded a promising target for therapeutic deep-brain stimulation (DBS). However, understanding the PPN's role in PD and assessing the potential of DBS are hampered by the lack of a suitable model of PPN degeneration. Rats were rendered Parkinsonian through a unilateral substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) stereotaxic injection of the proteasome inhibitor Lactacystin, to investigate whether the lesion's pathological effects spread to impact the integrity of PPN cholinergic neurons which are affected in PD. At 5 weeks post-surgery, stereological analysis revealed that the lesion caused a 48 % loss of dopaminergic SNpc neurons and a 61 % loss of PPN cholinergic neurons, accompanied by substantial somatic hypotrophy in the remaining cholinergic neurons. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed T2 signal hyper-/hypointensity in the PPN of the injected hemisphere, respectively at weeks 3 and 5 post-lesion. Moreover, isolated PPN cholinergic neurons revealed no significant alterations in key autophagy mRNA levels, suggesting that autophagy-related mechanisms fail to protect the PPN against Lactacystin-induced cellular changes. Hence, the current results suggest that the Lactacystin PD model offers a suitable model for investigating the role of the PPN in PD.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal motility dysfunctions including anorexia, nausea, heartburn, bloating, etc. are common and frequent complication of Parkinson's disease (PD). Degeneration of enteric nerves system is supposed to be a pathogenesis of these symptoms. Impairment of gastric emptying (GE) leads to retardation of the drug delivery from stomach to jejunum, so that PD patients with GE impairment show the delayed elevation of plasma L-dopa concentration. Disturbance of L-dopa absorption will result in wearing-off and delayed-on, and these are called motor fluctuation. In our investigation, 69% of PD patients who exhibited delayed elevation of plasma L-dopa concentration complicated GE impairment, whereas only 22% of patients with normal L-dopa level showed GE retardation (p = 0.0044, \u03c7(2)-test). Serotonin 5-HT4 agonist and dopamine D2 antagonist are useful to improve GE impairment in PD. These drugs stimulate the postganglionic cholinergic fiber to release acetylcholine amongst the enteric nerves system and facilitate the gastrointestinal tract. Rikkunshi-to, dietary herbal medicine, is also administered to ameliorate gastrointestinal symptoms in PD. Rikkunshi-to is reported to improve erratic GE and reduce the variation of plasma L-dopa level. Recently, intestinal continuous L-dopa administration is expected as the potential solution for L-dopa induced motor fluctuation in advanced PD.",

    "abstract": "An almost directly proportional increase in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate with exercise intensity has been reported in healthy subjects. In contrast, patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA) and pure autonomic failure (PAF) characterized by autonomic failure exhibit exercise-induced hypotension (EIH), prolonged hypotension following the cessation of exercise and exaggerated orthostatic hypotension after exercise. EIH, which can be the earliest symptom of PAF, provides a clue to the diagnosis of autonomic failure. Exercise-induced hypertension, which may be due to adrenergic receptor supersensitivity, may also be observed. BP during and after exercise was significantly lower in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) than in healthy subjects. Some PD patients exhibited symptoms related to EIH. PD patients who did not achieve 85\uff05 of target HR with treadmill testing lacked BP elevations during sub-maximal and peak exercise. On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in exercise-induced BP elevations between PD patients with and without cardiac sympathetic denervation. Since BP control during exercise in PD was not affected by dosing with levodopa, exercise-related BP abnormalities in PD appear to manifest with the disease. These findings suggest that PD has impaired exercise-induced BP control, but not to the extent of MSA and PAF.",

According to the cardio-sympathetic dysfunction, it is well known abnormal MIBG and orthostatic hypotension finding was seen in early disease stage. Furthermore denervation supersensitivity using \u03b21 stimulant correlates the severity of MIBG image, so that this abnormal cardiac function induces inadequate cardiac capacity for exercise. Inadequate cardiac capacity makes easy fatigability, which correlates the abnormal MIBG image and cardio-sympathetic damage. So it is difficult to prescribe a specific exercise program to meet individual PD patients needs. Music therapy and trunk exercise (for example Tai-Chi exercise) are better suited for PD patients.",

By clearly providing its treatment alternatives, the guideline allows us to strategically identify appropriate treatment measures for individual patients in consideration for their QOL as well as ADL. In the meantime, a few problems are experienced in the clinical application of the guideline. Medications excessively depending on therapeutic recommendations according to the guideline policy might result in to be monotonous, as on the previous version of the guideline.

We select GPi-DBS in patients judged by our cognitive function test battery to be at high-risk for cognitive decline after STN-DBS. While DBS surgery is usually performed under local anesthesia for the precise placement of DBS electrodes, general anesthesia might be useful in patients intolerant of long-lasting surgical stress. Our monkey experiments revealed that the most medial part of the STN receives direct input from the limbic cortex, suggesting that the spread of stimulation to these limbic territories may elicit adverse emotional effects. Other monkey experiments on the physiological mechanism of DBS suggest that high-frequency GPi stimulation disrupts information flow through the GPi.",

Animal studies demonstrated that cortical stimulation could improve Parkinsonism, and a meta-analysis of clinical studies showed efficacy of high frequency rTMS. We conducted two clinical trials of supplementary motor area rTMS therapy for Parkinson's disease, and reported long-lasting efficacy. Other studies targeted specified aspects of Parkinson's disease, or utilized newly developed stimulation protocols. rTMS therapy for PD is a promising area, and can be an important treatment option in the near future.",

New rehabilitation therapy is updated, in addition to evidence shown with \"Parkinson's disease treatment guidelines 2011\". Furthermore, a portable gait rhythmogram (acceleration sensor) is presented (not publication). Parkinsonian gait was significantly slow and the steps were small, but the cadence was not different compared as that of normal control. The strength of parkinsonian gait was apparently week compared as normal control. We also could examine consecutive changes of gait rhythm and detect freezing gait in patients. In this study, we could extract the characteristic of the parkinsonian gait and evaluate especially freeing events more objectively. This method may bring us to evaluate severity of parkinsonian gait not only in a consulting room but also daily profile even not to see directly, using the portable gait rhythmogram.",

    "abstract": "The aim of stem cell therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) is to reconstruct local synapse formation and/or induce the release of dopamine and cytokines from grafted cells in the putamen. Fetal ventral-midbrain cells are reported to relieve the neurological symptoms of PD patients. However, not only embryonic stem cells (ESCs), but also induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are expected to provide an alternative donor cell population because of their capacity for self-renewal and pluripotency. A protocol to generate dopaminergic (DA) neurons from ESCs and iPSCs has been developed, and human ESCs were proven to function in the brain of rat and monkey PD models. The next step will be the isolation of DA neurons as a donor cell population for a safe and efficient transplantation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in basic research toward neuroprotective strategies of Parkinson's disease (PD) are increasingly highlighting the need for early diagnosis of PD. Substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity, as visualized by transcranial sonography, has been heralded as a particularly useful diagnostic marker, as it is stable and remains unchanged with advancing stages of PD. In addition, SN hyperechogenicity is observable in patients in the very early stage, or even premorbid stages of PD. Prior studies have shown that SN hyperechogenicity is observable in approximately 90% of patients with PD and up to 10% of healthy controls. It has been hypothetically proposed that may be a vulnerability marker for nigrostriatal dopamine neuronds and may be related to an increase in iron content. It is expected that transcranial sonography of SN will be a feasible method for more accurate diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Brain MRI is essential for differentiating Parkinson's disease (PD) from other parkinsonian syndromes. The purpose of performing brain MRI is not to make a diagnosis of PD but is to exclude other parkinsonian syndromes. Recently, several new MRI techniques such as voxel based morphometry, relaxometry, magnetization transfer, spectroscopy, tractography, and functional MRI have been introduced in the diagnosis of PD. Neuromelanin imaging is one of the new techniques and can be useful to make an initial diagnosis of PD. MIBG myocardial scintigraphy is a sensitive imaging tool to differentiate PD from other parkinsonian syndromes and is one of the good tools to make an initial diagnosis of PD. Brain perfusion imaging is sometimes useful to make an initial diagnosis of PD, because reduced brain perfusion area can be detected before brain MRI detects morphological changes of the brain. Dopamine transporter imaging, not available in Japan, is a sensitive tool to detect very early parkinsonism and is useful to make an initial diagnosis of PD. However, it is difficult to differentiate PD from other parkinsonian syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms are common in patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease (PD), and some even predate the emergence of the classic motor features. The premotor phase of PD is characterized by several important non-motor features, including constipation, olfactory dysfunction, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), depression, etc. The basis of this prodromal stage is that the pathological process related to Lewy bodies, may start outside of the substantia nigra. We investigated 469 Japanese PD patients in our multicenter study, using the Japanese version of the RBD screening questionnaire. Probable RBD was detected in 146 patients (31%) and the RBD symptoms of 53 patients preceded the onset of PD motor symptoms. With the probable exception of RBD, non-motor clinical markers can be sensitive for an impending diagnosis of PD, but these features are common and non-specific. The combination of non-motor clinical markers and more specific markers (e.g., imaging or genetic markers) may achieve sufficient utility in PD diagnosis and prediction in future. Being able to diagnose that a patient has PD at an earlier time point than is currently possible, would be allowed to introduce potential disease-modifying therapies at a time when it could have fundamental and long-lasting effects.",

    "abstract": "Neurosurgical procedures are indispensable in management of various types of movement disorders (MD). Stereotactic operations that have been well established include deep brain stimulation for tremor, dystonia, and Parkinsonian symptoms. Recently the actual role of stereotactic ablative procedures such as thalamotomy and pallidotomy has been re-explored, and Vo thalamotomy shows long-term improvement of task specific focal dystonia like writer's cramp and musician's dystonia. A new less invasive treatment of tremor using MR guided focused ultrasound has started and is promising. Intrathecal administration of baclofen is also an established treatment for severe spasticity, but other ablative procedures such as peripheral neurotomy and dorsal rhizotomy are also important in spasticity treatment. It seems that most neurologists are unfamiliar, at least in Japan, with such neurosurgical procedures. However, neurologists involved in management of MD should understand the important roles of neurosurgical management of intractable MD and should refer such patients to appropriate neurosurgeons before permanent contracture and deformity develop.",

    "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) has recently been shown to be a promising novel neuroprotective agent for several neurodegenerative conditions. In the current study we extended previous work on neuroprotective potential for Parkinson's disease (PD) by testing an expanded dose range of VEGF-B (1 and 10 \u03bcg) and directly comparing both neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects of VEGF-B in progressive unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) PD models to a single dose of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF, 10 \u03bcg), that has been established by several groups as a standard in both preclinical PD models. In the amphetamine-induced rotational tests the treatment with 1 and 10 \u03bcg VEGF-B resulted in significantly improved motor function of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats compared to vehicle-treated 6-OHDA-lesioned rats in the neuroprotection paradigm. Both doses of VEGF-B caused an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cell and fiber count in the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum in the neuroprotective experiment. The effect size was comparable to the effects seen with GDNF. In the neurorestoration paradigm, VEGF-B injection had no significant effect in either the behavioral or the immunohistochemical analyses, whereas GDNF injection significantly improved the amphetamine-induced rotational behavior and reduced TH-positive neuronal cell loss in the SN. We also present a strong positive correlation (p=1.9e-50) of the expression of VEGF-B with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes involved in fatty acid metabolism in rat midbrain, pointing to the mitochondria as a site of action of VEGF-B. GDNF showed a positive correlation with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes that was not nearly as strong (p=0.018). VEGF-B counteracted rotenone-induced reduction of (a) fatty acid transport protein 1 and 4 levels and (b) both Akt protein and phosphorylation levels in SH-SY5Y cells. We further verified VEGF-B expression in the human SN pars compacta of healthy controls and PD patients, in neuronal cells that show co-expression with neuromelanin. These results have demonstrated that VEGF-B has potential as a neuroprotective agent for PD therapy and should be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "Visual sampling techniques are used to investigate the complex role of vision during real-world activities in Parkinson's disease. Earlier research is limited to static simple tasks or measurement of eye movements alone, but more recent investigations involve more real-world activities. The approach to the objective measurement of eye movements varies with respect to instrumentation, testing protocols, and mediating factors that may influence visual sampling.\nThe aim of this review was to examine previous work measuring visual sampling during real-world activities in Parkinson's disease to inform the development of robust protocols. Within this review a real-world activity was considered to be a goal-orientated motor task involving more than one body segment such as reaching or walking.\nMedline, Embase, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, PubMed and the Cochrane library databases were searched. Two independent reviewers and an adjudicator screened articles that described quantitative visual sampling in people with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls.\nTwenty full-text articles were screened and 15 met inclusion/exclusion criteria. A wide range of instruments and outcome measures were reported which were generally used in a task-dependent manner. Instrument reliability and validity was insufficiently reported in all studies. Few studies considered mediators of visual sampling such as visual or cognitive deficits.\nFuture research is required to accurately characterise visual impairments in Parkinson's disease and during real-world activities. Composite use of instruments may be required to achieve reliability and validity of visual sampling outcomes which need to be standardised. Recommendations also include assessment of cognition and basic visual function.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the thalamic ventrointermediate nucleus (Vim) is a useful treatment in patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). Efficacy to alleviate rigidity remains controversial. We report a 65-year-old right-handed man with persistent severe rigidity and bradykinesia on the right side despite daily administration of levodopa/carbidopa (600/60mg). His right-hand tremor was continuous at rest and present at action. His antiparkinsonian medications appeared ineffective and he reported difficulties with writing and eating. Repeated (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy studies demonstrated a non-PD pattern. He underwent the stereotactic implantation of a DBS electrode into the left Vim. Using contacts 1 and 2 we started continuous unipolar stimulation with a pulse generator implanted in a subclavian pocket. This improved the tremor and the rigidity and bradykinesia of his right hand. Postoperative image analysis revealed the likelihood of simultaneous stimulation of the Vim and the nucleus ventralis oralis posterior. Our findings suggest thalamic stimulation as a therapeutic option for drug-resistant rigidity (and tremor) in patients with parkinsonian syndromes ineligible for DBS targeted at the globus pallidus internus or subthalamic nucleus.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction, often preceding the cardinal motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor at rest and postural instability, is frequently reported in Parkinson's disease. This symptom appears to be related to an increased number of dopamine neurons in the periglomerular layer of the olfactory bulb. In animal models of Parkinson's disease, adult neural progenitor cells migrating from the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle to the olfactory bulb are evidently altered in their survival and progeny. The modulation of neural progenitor cells contributing to the number of dopamine neurons in the periglomerular layer, however, is still poorly understood. In this study, we have investigated the survival and neuronal differentiation of newly generated cells in the olfactory bulb, following treatment with the dopamine precursor l-DOPA and the monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor selegiline in a unilateral, intranigral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion model in mice. Our data show that the number of neural progenitor cells in the subventricular zone is decreased after an intranigral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion, while there is no difference from control in lesioned mice with selegiline or l-DOPA treatment. Selegiline is able to normalize the number of dopamine neurons in the periglomerular layer, while l-DOPA treatment sustains the increased number observed in 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned animals. We conclude that there is a distinct modulation of newly generated dopamine neurons of the olfactory bulb after l-DOPA and selegiline treatment. The differential effects of the two drugs might also play a role in olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "Clinical diagnostic criteria indicate presence of autonomic features as the primary hallmark of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). However involvement of the autonomic system is also a recognized feature of Parkinson's Disease (PD), yielding a broad clinical overlap between the two diseases. Laboratory assessments may help in the differential diagnosis between PD and MSA. Ambulatory Monitoring of Blood Pressure (AMBP) is a suitable tool to study the circadian rhythm of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). Different studies reported a reduction of physiological BP nocturnal dipping in PD and MSA patients, but failed to identify a distinctive pattern discriminating the two diseases. On the other hand, HR nocturnal behavior has not been exhaustively analyzed. In the present study we compared the profiles of HR circadian rhythm in 61 PD and 19 MSA patients who underwent 24 h AMBP. We found higher nocturnal HR (nHR) (71.5 beats/min \u00b1 7.4) in MSA compared with PD (63.8 beats/min \u00b1 9.6) as well as significantly lower nocturnal decline of HR (ndHR) in MSA (7.3% \u00b1 8.2) vs. PD (14% \u00b1 7.5). At a Receiver Operating Curve analysis nHR and ndHR significantly discriminated MSA from PD. nHR showed a sensitivity of 84.2% and a specificity of 62.3% (AUC 0.76; 95% IC 0.65-0.85); ndHR showed a sensitivity of 68% of and a specificity of 77% (AUC 0.72; 95% IC 0.61-0.82). According to our findings, nHR is increased and ndHR is reduced in MSA compared to PD. Moreover, these two indices discriminate between the two diseases with acceptable accuracy.",

    "abstract": "It has been repeatedly demonstrated that mentally performing an action and mentally transforming body-parts entail simulation of one's own body movements, consistent with predictions of embodied cognition theories. However, the involvement of embodied simulation in mental transformation of whole-body images is still disputed. Here, we assessed own body transformation in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with symptoms most affecting the left or the right body side. PD patients were required to perform left-right judgments on front-facing or back-facing human figures, and a letter rotation task. Results demonstrated that PD patients were selectively impaired in judging the side of back-facing human figures corresponding to their own most affected side, but performed as well as healthy subjects on mental transformation of front-facing bodies and on letter rotation. These findings demonstrate a parallel impairment between motor and mental simulation mechanisms in PD patients, thus highlighting the specific contribution of embodied cognition to mental transformation of whole-body images.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by loss of A9 dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). An association has been reported between PD and exposure to mitochondrial toxins, including environmental pesticides paraquat, maneb, and rotenone. Here, using a robust, patient-derived stem cell model of PD allowing comparison of A53T \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) mutant cells and isogenic mutation-corrected controls, we identify mitochondrial toxin-induced perturbations in A53T \u03b1-syn A9 DA neurons (hNs). We report a pathway whereby basal and toxin-induced nitrosative/oxidative stress results in S-nitrosylation of transcription factor MEF2C in A53T hNs compared to corrected controls. This redox reaction inhibits the MEF2C-PGC1\u03b1 transcriptional network, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptotic cell death. Our data provide mechanistic insight into gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the pathogenesis of PD. Furthermore, using small-molecule high-throughput screening, we identify the MEF2C-PGC1\u03b1 pathway as a therapeutic target to combat PD.",

    "abstract": "Numerous animal studies and clinical trials have demonstrated that erythropoietin (EPO) has therapeutic effects in ischemic and degenerative diseases. However, few clinical trials have investigated the effect of EPO in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. This study was an exploratory pilot study to investigate the effects of recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) on motor and non-motor symptoms (NMS) in PD patients.\nA total of 26 PD patients at the Hanyang University Hospital were enrolled in the study. The participants were randomly assigned to rhEPO and placebo groups. The rhEPO group was infused intravenously (40,000 IU each) twice a week for 5 weeks. Clinical improvement was estimated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III (UPDRS-III), the NMS Scale (NMSS) and the 39-Item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). [(18)F] N-(3-fluoropropyl)-2\u03b2-carbon ethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane (FP-CIT) photon emission tomography (PET) scanning was performed on each participant at baseline and again after 12 months.\nThe rhEPO administration significantly improved the NMSS and PDQ-39 scores at 12 months. The UPDRS-III, which reflects motor function, did not change significantly after the rhEPO treatment. With the NMSS, the domains of cardiovascular autonomic function, sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition and attention/memory showed significant changes. None of the participants experienced any serious adverse effects.\nWe found that rhEPO had beneficial effects on NMS but not on motor function. Dopaminergic refractory NMS, such as cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and cognition, showed improvement after the administration of rhEPO. Our results suggest that rhEPO might be a good candidate for the treatment of NMS in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by selective loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra (SN) to the striatum. The initial factor that triggers neurodegeneration is unknown; however, inflammation has been demonstrated to be significantly involved in the progression of PD. The present study was designed to investigate the role of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the activation of microglia and the decline of motor function using IL-1 knockout (KO) mice.\nLipopolysaccharide (LPS) was stereotaxically injected into the SN of mice brains as a single dose or a daily dose for 5 days (5 mg/2 ml/injection, bilaterally). Animal behavior was assessed with the rotarod test at 2 hr and 8, 15 and 22 days after the final LPS injection.\nLPS treatment induced the activation of microglia, as demonstrated by production of IL-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1 as well as a change in microglial morphology. The number of cells immunoreactive for 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) and nitrotyrosine (NT), which are markers for oxidative insults, increased in the SN, and impairment of motor function was observed after the subacute LPS treatment. Cell death and aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein were observed 21 and 30 days after the final LPS injection, respectively. Behavioral deficits were observed in wild-type and TNF\u03b1 KO mice, but IL-1 KO mice behaved normally. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene expression was attenuated by LPS treatment in wild-type and TNF\u03b1 KO mice but not in IL-1 KO mice.\nThe subacute injection of LPS into the SN induces PD-like pathogenesis and symptoms in mice that mimic the progressive changes of PD including the aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein. LPS-induced dysfunction of motor performance was accompanied by the reduced gene expression of TH. These findings suggest that activation of microglia by LPS causes functional changes such as dopaminergic neuron attenuation in an IL-1-dependent manner, resulting in PD-like behavioral impairment.",

Cell death and aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein were observed 21 and 30 days after the final LPS injection, respectively. Behavioral deficits were observed in wild-type and TNF\u03b1 KO mice, but IL-1 KO mice behaved normally.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, degenerative neurological disorder that is estimated to affect at least 1 million individuals in the USA and over 10 million worldwide. It is thought that the loss of neurons and development of inclusion bodies occur gradually over decades until they progress to the point where ~60% of the dopamine neurons are lost and patients present with motor dysfunction. At present, it is not clear what causes this progression, and there are no current therapies that have been successful in preventing PD progression. Although there are many hypotheses regarding the mechanism of PD progression, neuroinflammation may be a major contributor to PD pathogenesis. Indeed, activated microglia and subsequent neuroinflammation have been consistently associated with the pathogenesis of PD. Thus, interference with this process could provide a means of neuroprotection in PD. This review will discuss the potential of targeting microglia to reduce neuroinflammation in PD. Further, we discuss the potential of microglial ion channels to serve as novel targets for neuroprotection in PD.",

    "abstract": "PET with (18)F-9-fluoropropyl-(+)-dihydrotetrabenzazine ((18)F-DTBZ), a novel radiotracer targeting vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2), has been proven as a useful imaging marker to measure dopaminergic integrity.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of (18)F-DTBZ PET in detecting the monoaminergic degeneration in early Parkinson disease (PD) in vivo. Seventeen age-matched healthy subjects and 30 PD patients at early stage of disease (duration of disease \u2264 5 y) with mild and unilateral motor symptoms underwent (18)F-DTBZ PET scans. The severity of disease, including Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale and modified Hoehn and Yahr Stage (mHY), were recorded at off-medication states. The standardized volumes of interest were applied to the spatial normalized image for quantification analysis. The specific uptake ratios (SURs) were calculated according to the formula (specific volumes-of-interest counts/occipital cortex counts) - 1. SUR measurements were summarized for each brain region.\nThe mean duration of disease in the PD group was 3.2 \u00b1 2.1 y (range, 0.5-5 y). The mean mHY was 1.0 \u00b1 0.1 (range, 1-1.5). The SURs of bilateral caudate, anterior putamen, posterior putamen, substantia nigra, and nucleus accumbens were significantly lower in PD patients than those of healthy subjects. The reduction of SURs was most severe in the contralateral (the brain regions that are located opposite to the symptomatic side) posterior putamen (-81%), followed by the ipsilateral posterior putamen (-67%). Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis showed that the SURs of the bilateral posterior putamen and contralateral anterior putamen had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100% in differentiating PD patients from healthy subjects.\n(18)F-DTBZ PET was as an excellent tool for the early diagnosis of PD. The obvious decline of (18)F-DTBZ uptake in the ipsilateral (asymptomatic) striatum suggested that (18)F-DTBZ PET might serve as an in vivo biomarker to detect the monoaminergic degeneration in the premotor phase of PD.",

The SURs of bilateral caudate, anterior putamen, posterior putamen, substantia nigra, and nucleus accumbens were significantly lower in PD patients than those of healthy subjects. The reduction of SURs was most severe in the contralateral (the brain regions that are located opposite to the symptomatic side) posterior putamen (-81%), followed by the ipsilateral posterior putamen (-67%). Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis showed that the SURs of the bilateral posterior putamen and contralateral anterior putamen had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100% in differentiating PD patients from healthy subjects.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and nonmotor dysfunctions, which include sleep disturbances. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is associated with numerous physiologic changes such as memory consolidation. Compelling evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) is crucial to both sleep regulation and memory consolidation. In our study, we explored changes in biologic molecules during various sleep stages and the effects of sleep on memory consolidation in PD.\nTen PD patients and 14 volunteers without PD participated in our study. The gene expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in all sleep stages was measured using realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on polysomnography (PSG)-guided peripheral blood sampling. In addition, the efficiency of memory consolidation during the sleep of the participants was measured using the Wechsler Memory Scale, third edition (WMS-III).\nThe iNOS expression increased in all sleep stages among the PD patients compared to the control participants, in whom iNOS expression decreased during REM sleep. Regarding memory consolidation, the performance of the controls in logic memory and the patients in visual reproduction tasks improved after sleep.\nThe iNOS synthase expression was different from control participants among PD patients, and the expression was dissimilar in various sleep stages. Sleep might enhance memory consolidation and there are different memory consolidation profiles between PD and control participants demonstrating distinct memory consolidation profiles.",

    "abstract": "Supervised machine learning has been proposed as a revolutionary approach for identifying sensitive medical image biomarkers (or combination of them) allowing for automatic diagnosis of individual subjects. The aim of this work was to assess the feasibility of a supervised machine learning algorithm for the assisted diagnosis of patients with clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease (PD) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP).\nMorphological T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) of PD patients (28), PSP patients (28) and healthy control subjects (28) were used by a supervised machine learning algorithm based on the combination of Principal Components Analysis as feature extraction technique and on Support Vector Machines as classification algorithm. The algorithm was able to obtain voxel-based morphological biomarkers of PD and PSP.\nThe algorithm allowed individual diagnosis of PD versus controls, PSP versus controls and PSP versus PD with an Accuracy, Specificity and Sensitivity>90%. Voxels influencing classification between PD and PSP patients involved midbrain, pons, corpus callosum and thalamus, four critical regions known to be strongly involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of PSP.\nClassification accuracy of individual PSP patients was consistent with previous manual morphological metrics and with other supervised machine learning application to MRI data, whereas accuracy in the detection of individual PD patients was significantly higher with our classification method.\nThe algorithm provides excellent discrimination of PD patients from PSP patients at an individual level, thus encouraging the application of computer-based diagnosis in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 8 (SCA8) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of untranslated CTA/CTG triplet repeats on 13q21. The phenomenology of SCA8 is relatively varied when compared to the other types of SCAs and its spectrum is not well established.\nTwo newly detected cases of SCA8 with the nonataxic phenotype and unusual clinical manifestations such as dopaminergic-treatment-responsive parkinsonism and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are described herein. Family A expressed good dopaminergic treatment-responsive parkinsonism as an initial manifestation and developed mild cerebellar ataxia with additional movements, including dystonic gait and unusual oscillatory movement of the trunk, during the disease course. The proband of family B presented as probable ALS with cerebellar atrophy on brain MRI, with a positive family history (a brother with typical cerebellar ataxia) and genetic confirmation for SCA8.\nOur findings support that the non-ataxic phenotypes could be caused by a mutation of the SCA8 locus which might affect neurons other than the cerebellum.",

    "abstract": "Exercise is recommended for every patient with Parkinson's disease (PD). The effectiveness of two different forms of exercise for PD, Tai Chi and combined stretching-strengthening exercise, was compared.\nPatients with mild-to-moderate PD were recruited to join either the combined stretching-strengthening exercise group (n=7), the Tai Chi group (n=9), or the control (nonintervention) group (n=7). Exercise was performed three times a week over a period of 8 weeks. The Tai Chi exercise was led by certified instructors based on a Tai-Chi-for-arthritis program. The combined stretching-strengthening exercise comprised folk dancing, stepping, and elastic-band exercises. The subjects' functional fitness, parkinsonian symptoms, quality of life (QoL), and depression were evaluated.\nBoth exercise groups yielded better results in their overall functional fitness after the intervention. However, no improvement with exercise was found for parkinsonian symptoms, as evaluated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. With respect to the domains of QoL, the combined stretching-strengthening exercise group fared better in the social domain of QoL, and the Tai Chi group fared better in the emotional domain, while QoL and depression worsened in the control group. The postintervention QoL was improved relative to the control condition only for the Tai Chi group. Although the exercise interventions did not have any effect on depression, the control group was associated with a significant deterioration.\nExercise improved the functional fitness and QoL of PD patients, with Tai Chi yielding better results in QoL and favorable results in functional fitness. These findings suggest that Tai Chi could be a good exercise strategy for patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is thought to play a significant role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Although it is currently considered a hallmark of such processes, the interweaving of a multitude of signaling cascades hinders complete understanding of the direct role of oxidative stress in neurodegeneration. In addition to its extensive use as an aging model, some researchers have turned to the invertebrate model Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) in order to further investigate molecular mediators that either exacerbate or protect against reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated neurodegeneration. Due to their fully characterized genome and short life cycle, rapid generation of C. elegans genetic models can be useful to study upstream markers of oxidative stress within interconnected signaling pathways. This report will focus on the roles of C. elegans homologs for the oxidative stress-associated transcription factor Nrf2, as well as the autosomal recessive, early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated proteins Parkin, DJ-1, and PINK1, in neurodegenerative processes.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in LRRK2 cause autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 encodes a multi-domain protein containing GTPase and kinase domains, and putative protein-protein interaction domains. Familial PD mutations alter the GTPase and kinase activity of LRRK2 in vitro. LRRK2 is suggested to regulate a number of cellular pathways although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To explore such mechanisms, it has proved informative to identify LRRK2-interacting proteins, some of which serve as LRRK2 kinase substrates. Here, we identify common interactions of LRRK2 with members of the dynamin GTPase superfamily. LRRK2 interacts with dynamin 1-3 that mediate membrane scission in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and with dynamin-related proteins that mediate mitochondrial fission (Drp1) and fusion (mitofusins and OPA1). LRRK2 partially co-localizes with endosomal dynamin-1 or with mitofusins and OPA1 at mitochondrial membranes. The subcellular distribution and oligomeric complexes of dynamin GTPases are not altered by modulating LRRK2 in mouse brain, whereas mature OPA1 levels are reduced in G2019S PD brains. LRRK2 enhances mitofusin-1 GTP binding, whereas dynamin-1 and OPA1 serve as modest substrates of LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation in vitro. While dynamin GTPase orthologs are not required for LRRK2-induced toxicity in yeast, LRRK2 functionally interacts with dynamin-1 and mitofusin-1 in cultured neurons. LRRK2 attenuates neurite shortening induced by dynamin-1 by reducing its levels, whereas LRRK2 rescues impaired neurite outgrowth induced by mitofusin-1 potentially by reversing excessive mitochondrial fusion. Our study elucidates novel functional interactions of LRRK2 with dynamin-superfamily GTPases that implicate LRRK2 in the regulation of membrane dynamics important for endocytosis and mitochondrial morphology.",

    "abstract": "Recently, increased serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels have been reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA).\nTo assess a correlation between the serum IGF-1 levels and clinical background factors in patients with PD and related disorders such as MSA and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).\nA total of 79 PD patients, 25 MSA patients, 16 PSP patients and 52 healthy controls were included in this study. The serum IGF-1 and growth hormone (GH) levels were measured in a fasting state. Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III was used to evaluate motor function. Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS) part II was also employed for the MSA patients.\nThe serum IGF-1 levels were significantly increased in the MSA patients compared with the PD patients and controls. No significant differences were observed in the serum GH levels among the patients and controls. The serum IGF-1 levels of PD patients with Hoehn and Yahr stage 2 were significantly higher than those of patients with Hoehn and Yahr stages 3-5. In patients with PD and PSP, the serum IGF-1 levels were negatively correlated with UPDRS part III. In contrast, patients with MSA showed a positive correlation of the serum IGF-1 levels with disease duration, UPDRS part III and UMSARS part II.\nThe difference in the serum IGF-1 level and its correlation with clinical variables among these disorders may reflect different ongoing disease processes in each disorder.",

    "abstract": "It has become increasingly evident that the nigrostriatal degeneration associated with Parkinson's disease initiates at the level of the axonal terminals in the putamen, and this nigrostriatal terminal dystrophy is either caused or exacerbated by the presence of \u03b1-synuclein immunopositive neuronal inclusions. Therefore, strategies aimed at reducing \u03b1-synuclein-induced early neuronal dystrophy may slow or halt the progression to overt nigrostriatal neurodegeneration. Thus, this study sought to determine if adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated overexpression of two molecular chaperone heat shock proteins, namely Hsp27 or Hsp70, in the AAV-\u03b1-synuclein viral gene transfer rat model of Parkinson's disease could prevent \u03b1-synuclein-induced early neuronal pathology.\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats were intranigrally coinjected with pathogenic (AAV-\u03b1-synuclein) and putative therapeutic (AAV-Hsp27 or AAV-Hsp70) viral vectors and were sacrificed 18\u00a0weeks postviral injection.\nIntranigral injection of AAV-\u03b1-synuclein resulted in significant \u03b1-synuclein accumulation in the substantia nigra and striatal terminals which led to significant dystrophy of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons without overt nigrostriatal neurodegeneration. Coinjection of AAV-Hsp70, but not AAV-Hsp27, significantly reduced AAV-\u03b1-synuclein-induced neuronal dystrophy.\nThese data confirm that overexpression of Hsp70 holds significant potential as a disease-modulating therapeutic approach for Parkinson's disease, with protective effects against early-onset \u03b1-synuclein-induced pathology demonstrated in the AAV-\u03b1-synuclein model.",

    "abstract": "Gene therapy targeting the SNCA gene yields promising results in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). The most challenging issue of the RNAi gene therapy strategy is maintaining efficient delivery without inducing significant toxicity and other adverse effects. This study aimed to characterize polyethylene glycol-polyethyleneimine as a vector for alpha-synuclein siRNA delivery to PC12 cells for Parkinson's disease.\nThe characteristics of PEG-PEI/siSNCA were analyzed via gel retardation assay and assessments of particle size and zeta potential. MTT cytotoxicity assay and flow cytometry were used to detect cytotoxicity and transfection efficiency in PC12 cells. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was employed to examine the intracellular distribution of PEG-PEI/FITC-siSNCA after cellular uptake. RT-PCR and western blotting were used to measure SNCA expression. The MTT cytotoxicity assay was used to study the effect of PEG-PEI/siSNCA on cell viability. The protective effect of PEG-PEI/siSNCA on MPP+-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells was examined via flow cytometry and Hoechst staining.\nPEG-PEI/siSNCA complexes were well-developed; they exhibited appropriate particle sizes and zeta potentials at a mass ratio of 5:1. In vitro, PEG-PEI/siSNCA was associated with low cytotoxicity and high transfection efficiency. Complexes were capable of successfully delivering siSNCA into PC12 cells and releasing it from the endosome. Furthermore, PEG-PEI/siSNCA could effectively suppress SNCA mRNA expression and protected cells from death via apoptosis induced by MPP(+) .\nOur results demonstrate that PEG-PEI performs well as a vector for alpha-synuclein siRNA delivery into PC12 cells. Additionally, PEG-PEI/siSNCA complexes were suggested to be able to protect cells from death via apoptosis induced by MPP(+) . These findings suggest that PEG-PEI/siSNCA nanoparticles exhibit remarkable potential as a gene delivery system for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra is a key pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. In the present study, we investigated the effects of treadmill exercise on short-term memory, apoptotic dopaminergic neuronal cell death and fiber loss in the nigrostriatum, and cell proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of Parkinson's rats. Parkinson's rats were made by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the striatum using stereotaxic instrument. Four weeks after 6-OHDA injection, the rats in the 6-OHDA-injection group exhibited significant rotational asymmetry following apomorphine challenge. The rats in the exercise groups were put on the treadmill to run for 30 min once a day for 14 consecutive days starting 4 weeks after 6-OHDA injection. In the present results, extensive degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra with loss of dopaminergic fibers in the striatum were produced in the rats without treadmill running, which resulted in short-term memory impairment. However, the rats performing treadmill running for 2 weeks alleviated nigrostriatal dopaminergic cell loss and alleviated short-term memory impairment with increasing cell proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of Parkinson's rats. The present results show that treadmill exercise may provide therapeutic value for the Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "A substantial number of individuals with Parkinson's disease exhibit debilitating non-motor symptoms that decrease quality of life. To date, few treatment options exist for the non-motor symptomatology related to Parkinson's disease. The goal of this pilot investigation was to determine the effects of Tai Chi exercise on the non-motor symptomology in Parkinson's disease.\nTwenty-one individuals with Parkinson's disease were enrolled in a Tai Chi intervention (n=15) or a noncontact control group (n=6). Participants assigned to Tai Chi participated in 60-minute Tai Chi sessions three times per week, for 16 weeks. Pre and post measures included indices of cognitive-executive function including visuomotor tracking and attention, selective attention, working memory, inhibition, processing speed and task switching. Additionally, all participants were evaluated on the Parkinson's disease Questionnaire-39 and Tinetti's Falls Efficacy Scale.\nResults indicated that the Tai Chi training group had significantly better scores following the intervention than the control group on the Parkinson's disease Questionnaire-39 total score as well as the emotional well-being sub score. Trends for improvement were noted for the Tai Chi group on Digits Backwards, Tinetti's Falls Efficacy Scale, and the activities of daily living and communication sub scores of the Parkinson's disease Questionnaire-39.\nThis research provides initial data that supports future studies to definitively establish efficacy of Tai Chi to improve non-motor features of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Sleep-wake disturbances and concomitant cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) contribute significantly to morbidity in patients and their carers. Subjectively reported daytime sleep disturbance is observed in over half of all patients with PD and has been linked to executive cognitive dysfunction. The current study used daytime actigraphy, a novel objective measure of napping and related this to neuropsychological performance in a sample of PD patients and healthy, age and gender-matched controls. Furthermore this study aimed to identify patients with PD who may benefit from pharmacologic and behavioural intervention to improve these symptoms.\nEighty-five PD patients and 21 healthy, age-matched controls completed 14 days of wrist actigraphy within two weeks of neuropsychological testing. Objective napping measures were derived from actigraphy using a standardised protocol and subjective daytime sleepiness was recorded by the previously validated Epworth Sleepiness Scale.\nPatients with PD had a 225% increase in the mean nap time per day (minutes) as recorded by actigraphy compared to age matched controls (39.2 \u00b1 35.2 vs. 11.5 \u00b1 11.0 minutes respectively, p < 0.001). Significantly, differences in napping duration between patients, as recorded by actigraphy were not distinguished by their ratings on the subjective measurement of excessive daytime sleepiness. Finally, those patients with excessive daytime napping showed greater cognitive deficits in the domains of attention, semantic verbal fluency and processing speed.\nThis study confirms increased levels of napping in PD, a finding that is concordant with subjective reports. However, subjective self-report measures of excessive daytime sleepiness do not robustly identify excessive napping in PD. Fronto-subcortical cognitive dysfunction was observed in those patients who napped excessively. Furthermore, this study suggests that daytime actigraphy, a non-invasive and inexpensive objective measure of daytime sleep, can identify patients with PD who may benefit from pharmacologic and behavioural interventions to improve these symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Cortical oscillatory signals of single and double tremor frequencies act together to cause tremor in the peripheral limbs of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). But the corticospinal pathway that transmits the tremor signals has not been clarified, and how alternating bursts of antagonistic muscle activations are generated from the cortical oscillatory signals is not well understood. This paper investigates the plausible role of propriospinal neurons (PN) in C3-C4 in transmitting the cortical oscillatory signals to peripheral muscles. Kinematics data and surface electromyogram (EMG) of tremor in forearm were collected from PD patients. A PN network model was constructed based on known neurophysiological connections of PN. The cortical efferent signal of double tremor frequencies were integrated at the PN network, whose outputs drove the muscles of a virtual arm (VA) model to simulate tremor behaviors. The cortical efferent signal of single tremor frequency actuated muscle spindles. By comparing tremor data of PD patients and the results of model simulation, we examined two hypotheses regarding the corticospinal transmission of oscillatory signals in Parkinsonian tremor. Hypothesis I stated that the oscillatory cortical signals were transmitted via the mono-synaptic corticospinal pathways bypassing the PN network. The alternative hypothesis II stated that they were transmitted by way of PN multi-synaptic corticospinal pathway. Simulations indicated that without the PN network, the alternating burst patterns of antagonistic muscle EMGs could not be reliably generated, rejecting the first hypothesis. However, with the PN network, the alternating burst patterns of antagonist EMGs were naturally reproduced under all conditions of cortical oscillations. The results suggest that cortical commands of single and double tremor frequencies are further processed at PN to compute the alternating burst patterns in flexor and extensor muscles, and the neuromuscular dynamics demonstrated a frequency dependent damping on tremor, which may prevent tremor above 8 Hz to occur.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether there is an association between retinal thinning and functional rating scales in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nPatients with PD (n=153) and controls (n=242) underwent evaluations of the macula and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) using two new-generation Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) devices (Cirrus, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, California, USA; Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). PD severity was assessed using the Schwab-England Activities of Daily Living scale, the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) scale. Retinal and RNFL thicknesses were compared between patients and controls. Correlations between structural parameters and the scores of the neurologic scales were evaluated.\nRNFL parameters were significantly reduced in patients with PD, especially when using the Spectralis OCT device. All macular parameters, except for foveal thickness, differed significantly between controls and patients with PD (p<0.001). HY scores were significantly and inversely correlated with all macular parameters when measured with the Spectralis OCT device (p<0.05) and with RNFL thickness when measured with the Cirrus OCT device (nasal quadrant, sectors 2 and 5).\nThe neurodegeneration caused by PD can be detected using Fourier domain OCT.

    "abstract": "In recent years, inflammation has become implicated as a major pathogenic factor in the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease. Understanding the precise role for inflammation in PD will likely lead to understanding of how sporadic disease arises. In vivo evidence for inflammation in PD includes microglial activation, increased expression of inflammatory genes in the periphery and in the central nervous system (CNS), infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the CNS, and altered composition and phenotype of peripheral immune cells. These findings are recapitulated in various animal models of PD and are reviewed herein. Furthermore, we examine the potential relevance of PD-linked genetic mutations to altered immune function and the extent to which environmental exposures that recapitulate these phenotypes, which may lead to sporadic PD through similar mechanisms. Given the implications of immune system involvement on disease progression, we conclude by reviewing the evidence supporting the potential efficacy of immunomodulatory therapies in PD prevention or treatment. There is a clear need for additional research to clarify the role of immunity and inflammation in this chronic, neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), depressive symptom rating scales facilitate identification of depressive disorders, which are common and disabling. Anxiety disturbances in PD, which lack valid assessment scales, frequently co-occur with PD-depression, are under-recognized, and require different interventions than depressive disorders. Whether high anxiety rates in PD confound depression scale performance or if any depression scales also predict anxiety disturbances is not known.\nTo test the impact of co-occurring anxiety disorders on psychometric properties of depression rating scales in depressed PD patients and compare disability between PD patients with anxiety, depression, and comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders.\nPD subjects (n = 229) completed self-report and clinician-administered depression scales. Receiver operating characteristic curves were developed to estimate psychometric properties of each scale in those with depression alone, anxiety alone, and comorbid depression and anxiety. Between-group differences on all measures were examined.\nComorbid anxiety did not affect the psychometric properties of any scale when identifying depressive disorders, but is associated with greater symptom severity and disability. Depression-scale scores were not significantly different between subjects with anxiety disorders only and those without depressive or anxiety diagnoses.\nCo-occurring anxiety disorders do not impact performance of depression rating scales in depressed PD patients. However, depression rating scales do not adequately identify anxiety disturbances alone or in patients with depression.",

    "abstract": "Assessing the frequency of Wearing-Off (WO) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and its impact on Quality of Life (QoL).\nConsecutive ambulatory patients, who were on dopaminergic treatment for \u2265 1 year, were included in this multicentre, observational cross-sectional study. In a single visit, WO was diagnosed based on neurologist assessment as well as using the validated Italian version of a patient self-rated 19-question Wearing-Off Questionnaire (WOQ-19); WO was defined for scores \u2265 2. QoL was evaluated by the 8-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8).\n617 subjects were included, with a mean anti-Parkinson treatment duration of 6.6 \u00b1 4.6 years, 87.2% were on levodopa treatment. Neurologists identified presence of WO in 351 subjects (56.9%), whereas 415 subjects (67.3%) were identified by the self-administered WOQ-19. In patients with a <2.5 years disease duration, WO was diagnosed in 12 subjects (21.8%) by neurologists and in 23 subjects (41.8%) by the WOQ-19. The most frequent WO symptoms, as identified by WOQ-19, were \"slowness of movements\" (55.8%) and \"reduced dexterity\" (48.8%). Younger age, female gender, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part II score and duration of anti-Parkinson treatment were found significantly associated with WO. The number of motor (p < 0.0001) and non-motor (p < 0.0001) WO symptoms correlated with PDQ-8 total score.\nWO is common already at the early stages of PD and is underestimated by routine neurological clinical evaluation. The number of WO symptoms, both motor and non motor, increases along with disease duration and has a negative impact on patients QoL.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing interest in developing a reliable, affordable and accessible disease biomarker of Parkinson's disease (PD) to facilitate disease modifying PD-trials. Imaging biomarkers using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can describe parameters such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). These parameters, when measured in the substantia nigra (SN), have not only shown promising but also varying and controversial results. To clarify the potential diagnostic value of nigral DTI in PD and its dependency on selection of region-of-interest, we undertook a high resolution DTI study at 3\u00a0T. 59 subjects (32 PD patients, 27 age and sex matched healthy controls) were analysed using manual outlining of SN and substructures, and voxel-based analysis (VBA). We also performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to estimate the effect size (DES) of disease related nigral DTI changes. We found a regional increase in nigral mean diffusivity in PD (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD, PD 0.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10 vs. controls 0.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0\u00b7\u00a010(-\u00a03)\u00a0mm(2)/s, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), but no difference using a voxel based approach. No significant disease effect was seen using meta-analysis of nigral MD changes (10 studies, DES\u00a0=\u00a0+\u00a00.26, p\u00a0=\u00a00.17, I(2)\u00a0=\u00a030%). None of the nigral regional or voxel based analyses of this study showed altered fractional anisotropy. Meta-analysis of 11 studies on nigral FA changes revealed a significant PD induced FA decrease. There was, however, a very large variation in results (I(2)\u00a0=\u00a086%) comparing all studies. After exclusion of five studies with unusual high values of nigral FA in the control group, an acceptable heterogeneity was reached, but there was non-significant disease effect (DES\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a00.5, p\u00a0=\u00a00.22, I(2)\u00a0=\u00a028%). The small PD related nigral MD changes in conjunction with the negative findings on VBA and meta-analysis limit the usefulness of nigral MD measures as biomarker of Parkinson's disease. The negative results of nigral FA measurements at regional, sub-regional and voxel level in conjunction with the results of the meta-analysis of nigral FA changes question the stability and validity of this measure as a PD biomarker.",

    "abstract": "Detection and discrimination of neurodegenerative Parkinson syndromes are challenging clinical tasks and the use of standard T1- and T2-weighted cerebral magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is limited to exclude symptomatic Parkinsonism. We used a quantitative structural MR-based technique, MR-elastography (MRE), to assess viscoelastic properties of the brain, providing insights into altered tissue architecture in neurodegenerative diseases on a macroscopic level. We measured single-slice multifrequency MRE (MMRE) and three-dimensional MRE (3DMRE) in two neurodegenerative disorders with overlapping clinical presentation but different neuropathology - progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP: N\u00a0=\u00a016) and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD: N\u00a0=\u00a018) as well as in controls (N\u00a0=\u00a018). In PSP, both MMRE (\u0394\u03bc\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a028.8%, \u0394\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a04.9%) and 3DMRE (\u0394|G*|: -\u00a010.6%, \u0394\u03c6: -\u00a034.6%) were significantly reduced compared to controls, with a pronounced reduction within the lentiform nucleus (\u0394\u03bc\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a034.6%, \u0394\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a08.1%; \u0394|G*|: -\u00a07.8%, \u0394\u03c6: -\u00a044.8%). MRE in PD showed a comparable pattern, but overall reduction in brain elasticity was less severe reaching significance only in the lentiform nucleus (\u0394\u03bc n.s., \u0394\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a07.4%; \u0394|G*|: -\u00a06.9%, \u0394\u03c6: n.s.). Beyond that, patients showed a close negative correlation between MRE constants and clinical severity. Our data indicate that brain viscoelasticity in PSP and PD is differently affected by the underlying neurodegeneration; whereas in PSP all MRE constants are reduced and changes in brain softness (reduced \u03bc and |G*|) predominate those of viscosity (\u03b1 and \u03c6) in PD.",

    "abstract": "It is not yet well understood how dopaminergic therapy improves cognitive and motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD). One possibility is that it reduces the pathological synchronization within and between the cortex and basal ganglia, thus improving neural communication. We tested this hypothesis by recording scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in PD patients when On and Off medication, during a brief resting state epoch (no task), and during performance of a stop signal task that is thought to engage two partially overlapping (or different) frontal-basal-ganglia circuits. For resting state EEG, we measured pair-wise coherence between scalp electrodes in several frequency bands. Consistent with previous studies, in the Off medication state, those patients with the greatest clinical impairment had the strongest coherence, especially in the beta band, indicating pathological over-synchronization. Dopaminergic medication reduced this coherence. For the stop signal task, On vs. Off medication increased beta band power over right frontal cortex for successful stopping and over bilateral sensorimotor cortex for going, especially for those patients who showed greater clinical improvement. Thus, medication reduced pathological coherence in beta band at rest and increased task related beta power for two potentially dissociable cortico-basal ganglia circuits. These results support the hypothesis that dopaminergic medication in PD improves neural communication both at rest and for executive and motor function.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder whose etiology is still unclear in spite of extensive investigations. It has been hypothesized that 5-S-cysteinyldopamine (CysDA), a catechol-thioether metabolite of dopamine (DA), could be an endogenous parkinsonian neurotoxin. To gain further insight into its role in the neurodegenerative process, both CD1 mice and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were treated with CysDA, and the data were compared with those obtained by the use of 6-hydroxydopamine, a well-known parkinsonian mimetic. Intrastriatal injection of CysDA in CD1 mice caused a long-lasting depletion of DA, providing evidence of in vivo neurotoxicity of CysDA. Both in mice and in SH-SY5Y cells, CysDA treatment induced extensive oxidative stress, as evidenced by protein carbonylation and glutathione depletion, and affected the expression of two proteins, \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) and ERp57, whose levels are modulated by oxidative insult. Real-time PCR experiments support these findings, indicating an upregulation of both ERp57 and \u03b1-Syn expression. \u03b1-Syn aggregation was also found to be modulated by CysDA treatment. The present work provides a solid background sustaining the hypothesis that CysDA is involved in parkinsonian neurodegeneration by inducing extensive oxidative stress and protein aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Although alterations in resting-state functional connectivity between brain regions have previously been reported in Parkinson's disease, the spatial organization of these changes remains largely unknown. Here, we longitudinally studied brain network topology in Parkinson's disease in relation to clinical measures of disease progression, using magnetoencephalography and concepts from graph theory. We characterized whole-brain functional networks by means of a standard graph analysis approach, measuring clustering coefficient and shortest path length, as well as the construction of a minimum spanning tree, a novel approach that allows a unique and unbiased characterization of brain networks. We observed that brain networks in early stage untreated patients displayed lower local clustering with preserved path length in the delta frequency band in comparison to controls. Longitudinal analysis over a 4-year period in a larger group of patients showed a progressive decrease in local clustering in multiple frequency bands together with a decrease in path length in the alpha2 frequency band. In addition, minimum spanning tree analysis revealed a decentralized and less integrated network configuration in early stage, untreated Parkinson's disease that also progressed over time. Moreover, the longitudinal changes in network topology identified with both techniques were associated with deteriorating motor function and cognitive performance. Our results indicate that impaired local efficiency and network decentralization are very early features of Parkinson's disease that continue to progress over time, together with reductions in global efficiency. As these network changes appear to reflect clinically relevant phenomena, they hold promise as markers of disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Misfolded proteins and subsequent protein aggregation appears to underlie a significant fraction of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease. One of the neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease is the presence of \u03b1-syn containing intracellular inclusions known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Intrabodies are antibody fragments that have been engineered to be expressed intracellularly. They can be directed towards specific target antigens present in various subcellular locations, and have shown promise in cancer, HIV, autoimmune diseases, and Huntington's disease. More recently they have been shown to modulate abnormalities caused by aggregated \u03b1-syn in cell culture. This mini-review mainly focuses on summarizing structural and cellular effects of intrabodies shown to have affinity for different forms of \u03b1-synuclein (monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar), as well as those exhibiting affinity for particular residues of \u03b1-synuclein (e.g., the NAC region, C terminal region).",

    "abstract": "The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) G2019S mutation is a common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although patients with sporadic PD and individuals with LRRK2-linked PD display the classical PD phenotype, it is not known whether or not the same biological pathways are deregulated in each context. By using transcriptome profiling, we investigated the deregulation of various biological pathways in a total of 47 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from patients with sporadic PD, patients heterozygous for the LRRK2 G2019S mutation compared to healthy controls. We found that the deregulation patterns were indeed similar in PBMCs obtained from patients with sporadic PD and from LRRK2 G2019S carriers, with dysfunctions in mitochondrial pathways, cell survival signaling, cancerization, endocytosis signaling and iron metabolism. Analysis of our PBMC data and other publicly available transcriptome datasets (for whole blood samples) showed that deregulation of the immune system, endocytosis and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (EIF2) signaling are the main features of transcriptome profiles in PD (since they are also present in the transcriptome of dopaminergic neurons from patients). Transcriptome analysis of PBMCs is thus valuable for (i) characterizing the pathophysiological pathways shared by genetic and sporadic forms of PD and (ii) identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This minimally invasive approach opens up tremendous perspectives for better diagnosis and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases because it can be applied from the earliest stages of the disease onwards.",

    "abstract": "In the present study we address the following questions: (1) How is performance affected when patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) perform a dynamic decision making task? (2) Does dopaminergic medication differentially affect dynamic decision making? To address these questions participants were trained with different goals during learning: either they made intervention-based decisions or prediction-based decisions during learning. The findings show that overall there is an advantage for those trained to intervene over those trained to predict. In addition, the results are the first demonstration that PD patients 'ON' (N=20) compared to 'OFF' L-Dopa (N=15) medication and also relative to healthy age matched controls (N=16) showed lower levels of relative improvement in the accuracy of their decisions in a dynamic decision making task, and tended to use sub-optimal strategies. These findings provide support for the 'Dopamine Overdose' hypothesis using a novel decision making task, and suggest that executive functions such as decision making can be adversely affected by dopaminergic medication in PD.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine deficiency affects functional integration of activity in distributed neural regions. It has been suggested that lack of dopamine induces disruption of neural interactions between prefrontal and premotor areas, which might underlie impairment of motor control observed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study we recorded cortical activity with high-density electroencephalography in 11 patients with PD as a pathological model of dopamine deficiency, and 13 healthy control subjects. Participants performed repetitive extension-flexion movements of their right index finger, which were externally paced at a rate of 0.5 Hz. This required participants to align their movement velocity to the slow external pace. Patients were studied after at least 12-hour withdrawal of dopaminergic medication (OFF state) and after intake of the dopamine precursor levodopa (ON state) in order to examine oscillatory coupling between prefrontal and premotor areas during respectively low and high levels of dopamine. In 10 patients and 12 control participants multiple source beamformer analysis yielded task-related activation of a contralateral cortical network comprising prefrontal cortex (PFC), lateral premotor cortex (lPM), supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortex (M1). Dynamic causal modelling was used to characterize task-related oscillatory coupling between prefrontal and premotor cortical areas. Healthy participants showed task-induced coupling from PFC to SMA, which was modulated within the \u03b3-band. In the OFF state, PD patients did not express any frequency-specific coupling between prefrontal and premotor areas. Application of levodopa reinstated task-related coupling from PFC to SMA, which was expressed as high-\u03b2-\u03b3 coupling. Additionally, strong within-frequency \u03b3-coupling as well as cross-frequency \u03b8-\u03b3 coupling was observed from PFC to lPM. Enhancement of this cross-frequency \u03b8-\u03b3 coupling after application of levodopa was positively correlated with individual improvement in motor function. The results demonstrate that dopamine deficiency impairs the ability to establish oscillatory coupling between prefrontal and premotor areas during an externally paced motor task. Application of extrinsic dopamine in PD patients reinstates physiological prefrontal-premotor coupling and additionally induces within- and cross-frequency coupling from prefrontal to premotor areas, which is not expressed in healthy participants.",

While used in multiple sports concussion studies, it has not been applied to the field of movement disorders.\nForty-five Parkinson's disease (PD), 23 essential tremor (ET), and 65 control subjects were studied. Subjects performed two trials of reading out loud single-digit numbers separated by varying spacing on three test cards that were of different formats. The sum time of the faster trial was designated the KD score and compared across the three groups.\nPD patients had higher (worse) KD scores, with longer reading times compared to ET and control subjects (66 s vs. 49 s vs. 52 s, p < 0.001, adjusting for age and gender). No significant difference was found between ET and control (\u0394 = -3 s, 95% CI: -10 to 4).\nThis is the first study of the King-Devick Test in Parkinson's disease.

    "abstract": "We developed a therapeutic educational program in Parkinson's disease (PD). The needs analysis for this program was performed through a survey involving 41 PD patients. This survey questionnaire was elaborated through the analysis of 395 patients' semi-directive interviews, performed in our specialized hospitalisation unit during explanation workshops between 2005 and 2007. We managed to design an educational program tailored to specificities of PD and according to the recommendations of the High Authority of Health in France (HAS). This program was based on individual sessions conducted by a nurse experienced in PD and trained in education. Collective workshops concerning specific themes such as physical therapy, communication, social supports, sleep disorders, stress management, therapies in PD could be proposed to volunteer patients and were performed by the nurse, a physiotherapist and a specialized practitioner. This program focused on skills structured in knowledge, expertise, and learning. It was intended for patients without any motor or cognitive severe impairment. We educated 231 patients between 2008 and 2012 individually and 113 in collective workshops. Patients had an interesting improvement in their self-esteem (6.2\u00b11.4 before and 7.3\u00b11.1 after one year of this educational program). This program has been validated by our regional medical agency and we performed a medico-economic study demonstrating a significant improvement in quality-of-life of educated patients without extra costs.",

    "abstract": "Autonomic nervous system dysfunction (ANSd) heralds or follows motor symptoms (MS) in Parkinson disease (PD), but may precede years and progress more rapidly in multiple system atrophy (MSA). Cardiac dysautonomia severity correlates with disabling symptoms thus a Cardiac Autonomic Nervous System Evaluation protocol (CANSEp) is useful to assess ANSd in PD and MSA patients.\nConsecutive patients with PD or MSA were studied. The severity of MS was quantified with UPDR III and Hoehn/Yahr scales. CANSEp consisted of the 5-test Ewing protocol (EP) and Heart Rate Variability analysis (HRVa), in time-domain (TD) and frequency-domain (FD). 36 patients with parkinsonian symptoms (23 PD, 13 MSA) and 40 healthy controls were studied. Parkinsonism was more severe in MSA, comparing UPDR III and Hoehn/Yahr scales (p<0.0001). Higher EP's scores were found in MSA (mean 5.1\u00b11.98) compared to PD (mean 3.5\u00b12) and controls (score 0.25\u00b10.1). TD and FD-HRVa were abnormal in PD and MSA, compared to controls. In PD depression of vagal tone was predominant during sleep, whereas in MSA depression of sympathetic tone prevailed during daily activity.\nWhereas its specificity is very high, the sensitivity of the EP was only 43.5% in PD and 76.9% in MSA. HRVa improved diagnosis accuracy in 10 patients, unidentified by the EP alone, with overall sensitivity of 65.2% in PD and 92.3% in MSA. Thus CANSEp provides a better assessment of cardiovascular dysautonomia in parkinsonian syndromes, useful to differentiate PD from MSA and to address clinical and pharmacological management.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the discrepancy of anorectal function in patients of Parkinson's disease (PD) with constipation and functional constipation (FC).\nFifteen consecutive male PD patients with constipation and 45 male FC patients were recruited for the study. All subjects underwent colonoscopy or barium enema in order to exclude organic colon diseases. Every patient underwent anorectal manometry and was categorized into subgroups of either dyssynergia defecation (F3a) or inadequate defecatory propulsion (F3b).\nThe ages of PD with constipation and FC patients were (70 \u00b1 11) and (68 \u00b1 11) years old respectively. The rectal resting pressure in PD with constipation was higher than that in FC group without statistical significance [9.0(4.0, 15.0) mm Hg vs 6.0(3.0, 9.5) mm Hg, P = 0.082, 1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa]. The anal resting pressure in PD group was not different from FC group [(51.2 \u00b1 17.2) mm Hg vs (59.7 \u00b1 20.4) mm Hg, P = 0.152]. During anal squeezing, the maximal contraction pressure and area under the squeeze curve in PD with constipation group were both significantly lower than FC patients [maximal contraction pressure: (136.9 \u00b1 43.8) mm Hg vs (183.0 \u00b1 62.1) mm Hg, P = 0.010; area under the squeeze curve: (823.5 \u00b1 635.7) mm Hg\u00b7s vs (1392.4 \u00b1 939.9) mm Hg\u00b7s, P = 0.033]. During forced defecation, both of the defecation rectal pressure and defecation anal pressure in PD with constipation group were significantly lower than that of FC patients [22.0(15.0, 30.0) vs 42.0(31.0, 55.0) mm Hg, P = 0.000; and (46.3 \u00b1 23.3) vs (77.9 \u00b1 35.1) mm Hg, P = 0.002]. The proportions of F3a subtype were 10/15 and 46.7% (21/45) in PD with constipation and FC patients respectively. There was no significant difference in the constituent ratio (P = 0.120). Initial rectal sensory volumes were (91.3 \u00b1 56.9) ml and (67.2 \u00b1 38.9) ml in PD with constipation and FC patients respectively. Even both volumes were higher than the normal controls, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.074).\nBoth PD with constipation and FC patients have abnormal anorectal motility and sensation comparing to the FC group, the parameters of anal contraction and defecation are significantly lower, F3b is dominant, and rectal sensory threshold is higher in PD with constipation patients. These parameters could possibly characterize the anorectal manometry for PD with constipation patients, which is helpful to understand the pathogenesis of PD and differentiate from other diseases.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the characteristics of pulmonary function and respiratory muscle performance in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson's disease (PD).\nPulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength were evaluated in 16 MSA patients and 20 PD patients. Another 17 age and sex-matched healthy volunteers were recruited as controls.\nCarbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO) was significantly decreased in MSA group compared with PD group [(62.86 \u00b1 15.66)% vs (76.67 \u00b1 18.98)%, respectively, P < 0.05]. Maximal inspiration pressure (MIP) and maximal expiration pressure (MEP) were (39.08 \u00b1 22.99)% and (49.59 \u00b1 22.97)% in MSA group, (39.83 \u00b1 24.83)% and (49.26 \u00b1 22.86)% in PD group.

The reduction of respiratory muscle strength is remarkable. The insufficiency of pulmonary diffusion function is more severe in MSA than in PD. More attention should be paid to the compromised respiratory function in neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "To explore whether olfactory performance acts as a cognitive reserve in non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nPatients with non-demented PD (n = 119) underwent T1-weighted MRI and olfactory identification tests. According to their olfactory performance, PD patients were subdivided into three groups of high score (PD-H, n = 38), middle score (PD-M, n = 48), and low score (PD-L, n = 33). We investigated the pattern of gray matter (GM) density according to olfactory performance using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and analyzed the correlation between GM density and olfactory performance.\nNo significant differences in demographic characteristics were observed among the groups. A neuropsychological test showed that cognitive deficits in verbal memory function were more severe in the PD-L group than in the PD-H group. However, a VBM analysis revealed that patients in the PD-H group possessed significantly decreased GM density in the bilateral temporal areas, orbitofrontal areas, mesiofrontal areas extending into the cingulate gyrus, and prefrontal areas, compared with patients in the PD-L group. No areas exhibiting a significant difference in GM density were observed between the PD-H and PD-M groups. Olfactory performance in patients with PD was negatively correlated with both the brain GM volume and intracerebral volume; in particular, GM density in the caudate nucleus and putamen exhibited a negative correlation with olfactory performance.\nOur data show that a high olfactory performance may compensate GM volume loss in order to minimize the exhibition of cognitive impairment and thus may act as a cognitive reserve in non-demented patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease is a prevalent progressive neurodegenerative disorder, especially in western countries and among the elderly. This study aimed at evaluating serum iron and ferritin in patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease. In this case-control study, 50 patients with clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson disease (case group) were evaluated during a 12 month period. Fifty healthy persons (control group) recruited as well. Serum iron and ferritin levels were measured by biochemical and quantitative luminance methods, respectively in the case and control group. Fifty patients, 28 males and 22 females with the mean age of 64.53 +/- 10.18 (40-84) years and 50 controls were enrolled. Serum iron levels were 70.22 +/- 25.18 mg dL(-1) and 67.62 +/- 39.53 mg dL(-1) in case and control group, respectively. Serum ferritin levels were 129.79 +/- 137.67 ng dL(-1) and 109.87 +/- 154.71 ng dL(-1) in case and control group, respectively. There was no significant difference between different grades of Parkinson disease considering the serum level of iron or ferritin. The current study showed that generally there is no significant difference between the patients with the idiopathic Parkinson disease and healthy controls in terms of serum iron and ferritin levels. The same results were attributable to different grades of the disease.",

Underlying mechanisms and stress-induced changes to the neuronal networks have been highlighted. Examples of stress induced reversible symptoms that resemble parkinsonism in humans and in animal models raise the question whether emotional stress can cause striatal degeneration in susceptible patients. A Pubmed literature review searching for the terms 'Stress', 'Distress and Parkinson's disease', 'Emotional Distress and Parkinson's disease', 'Stress and Parkinson's disease', 'Prodromal Parkinson's disease', 'Non motor symptoms and Parkinson's disease', 'Paradoxical kinesia', 'Psychogenic parkinsonism', 'Functional somatic syndromes', 'Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Irritable bowel syndrome', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Dopamine and fibromyalgia', 'Dopamine and chronic fatigue syndrome' and 'Dopamine and irritable bowel syndrome' was carried out until April 2013. Articles were also identified through searches of the authors' own files. Only papers published in English were reviewed. The final reference list was generated on the basis of originality and relevance to the broad scope of this viewpoint.",

    "abstract": "To contribute to the ongoing discussion on the choice of a preference-based health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instrument to be used in cost-effectiveness analysis by studying and comparing the validity, sensitivity and relative efficiency of 15-D and EuroQol 5D 5L (EQ-5D-5L) in a Spanish Parkinson's disease (PD) population sample.\nOne hundred and thirty-three volunteers were asked to complete an interview using 15-D and EQ-5D-5L. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r) was used to test the convergent validity of these instruments with specific PD measures. Sensitivity and efficiency were compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and relative efficiency statistic, respectively.\nA strong correlation (r > 0.65; p < 0.001) was found between both 15-D and EQ-5D-5L utilities with the summary score of the PDQ-8, and a strong correlation (r > 0.50; p < 0.001) was found between 15-D and EQ-5D-5L utilities with the EQ-VAS. The areas under the ROC of both instruments all exceeded 0.5 (p < 0.001). The 15-D instrument was 4.1-29.8 % less efficient at detecting differences between patients with optimal HRQoL, while this instrument was 11 % more efficient at detecting differences between patients at mild and moderate to strong severity of the PD symptoms.\n15-D and EQ-5D-5L are showed to be valid and sensitivity generic HRQoL measures in Spanish PD patients with both instruments showing similar HRQoL dimension coverage and ceiling/floor effects. The 15-D has better efficiency and greater sensitivity to detect clinical changes in PD severity of the symptoms meanwhile the EQ-5D-5L is better to detect clinical HRQoL changes. Additionally, the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire requires less time than 15-D to be administered, and it might be more appropriate for studies conducted in Spain, since a country-specific \"value set\" is available for this instrument and not for the 15-D.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is affecting 5 million people worldwide, but the response mechanisms of the striatum are still unclear. Therefore, identification of gene expression alterations in the striatum will greatly assist the development of novel therapy strategies.\nWe performed a comprehensive gene expression analysis in 15 PD patients and 15 normal controls to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the expression profile GSE20291 from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were used to define functions and pathways altered in PD. Protein-protein interaction network was constructed to find out the modules with close interactions.\nTotal715 DEGs including 268 up-regulated and 447 down-regulated genes were obtained. GO functional enrichment analysis indicated that the genes related with neurons function and cell morphogenesis might be changed upon PD. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that most of the genes were enriched in the nodes of Gap junction, calcium signaling pathway, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, long-term potentiation, Alzheimer's disease and GnRH signaling pathway. Protein-protein interaction network and module analysis suggested that some apoptosis related genes, such as PRKCA, CDC42 and BCL2 may play critical roles in striatal neurons growth.\nIntrinsic striatal tyrosine hydroxylase interneurons growth may be promoted by changes in several genes expression and thus reduce the functional excitatory synapses.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the existing prospective observational studies on the morality risk among Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and determine the overall risk ratio (RR) of mortality by conducting a meta-analysis and systematic review. Original articles published in English were searched in PubMed and Embase databases prior to March 2013. Only prospective observational studies providing adjusted risk estimates related to PD and future mortality were considered eligible. Pooled adjusted RR and 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed either by fixed-effects models or by random-effects models. Eight studies with 72,833 participants were identified and analysed. In the pooled analyses, patients with PD had a greater risk of all-cause mortality (RR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.78-2.77). Subgroup analyses based on the design, gender, follow-up duration and sample size showed that a consistent positive association between PD and the mortality risk in each subgroup. However, no statistical significance was found for the baseline age <65 years (RR = 1.42; 95% CI: 0.72-2.77). PD patients with dementia had particularly high mortality risks (RR = 3.78; 95% CI: 2.06-6.92). This meta-analysis indicated that among patients with PD, the all-cause mortality increased by 2.22-fold compared with the general population. PD patients with dementia particularly had higher risks of mortality.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dynamics are essential for maintaining organelle stability and function. Through fission, fusion and mitophagic events, optimal populations of mitochondria are retained. Subsequently, alterations in such processes can have profound effects on the individual mitochondrion and the cell within which they reside. Neurons are post-mitotic energy-dependent cells and, as such, are particularly vulnerable to alterations in cellular bioenergetics and increased stress that may occur as a direct or indirect result of mitochondrial dysfunction. The trafficking of mitochondria to areas of higher energy requirements, such as synapses, where mitochondrial densities fluctuate, further highlights the importance of efficient mitochondrial dynamics in neurons. PD (Parkinson's disease) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder which is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. Complex I, the largest of all of the components of the electron transport chain is heavily implicated in PD pathogenesis. The exact series of events that lead to cell loss, however, are not fully elucidated, but are likely to involve dysfunction of mitochondria, their trafficking and dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the GBA1 gene, encoding the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, cause the lysosomal storage disorder GD (Gaucher's disease), and are associated with the development of PD (Parkinson's disease) and other Lewy body disorders. Interestingly, GBA1 variants are the most common genetic risk factor associated with PD. Although clinical studies argue a strong case towards a link between GBA1 mutations and the development of PD, mechanistic insights have been lacking. In the present article, we review recent findings that have provided some biochemical evidence to bridge this relationship, focusing on the molecular link between two proteins, \u03b1-synuclein and glucocerebrosidase, involved in PD and GD respectively.",

Fibroblasts from patients carrying pathogenic mutations that lead to PD have been reprogrammed into iPSCs, which can subsequently be differentiated into important cell types. Given the characteristic loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of PD patients, iPSC-derived midbrain dopaminergic neurons have been generated to investigate pathogenic mechanisms in this important cell type as a means of modelling PD. iPSC-derived cultures studied so far have been made from patients carrying mutations in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2), PINK1 [PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10)-induced putative kinase 1], PARK2 (encodes parkin) or GBA (\u03b2-glucocerebrosidase), in addition to those with SNCA (\u03b1-synuclein) multiplication and idiopathic PD. In some cases, isogenic control lines have been created to minimize inherent variability between lines from different individuals. Disruptions in autophagy, mitochondrial function and dopamine biology at the synapse have been described. Future applications for iPSC-derived models of PD beyond modelling include drug testing and the ability to investigate the genetic diversity of PD.",

    "abstract": "Neuro-inflammation and dysfunction of blood-brain barrier play an important role in the occurrence, development, and neuronal degeneration of Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies have demonstrated that a variety of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 destroy the structure and function of blood-brain barrier. The damage to blood-brain barrier results in death of dopaminergic neurons, while protection of blood-brain barrier slows down the progression of PD. Also, it has been shown that activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) plays an important role in causing damage to blood-brain barrier. In addition, the PARP inhibitor 3-AB has been shown to protect blood-brain barrier from damage and has neuroprotective effects. In this study, using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PD rat model, we investigated whether 3-AB protects blood-brain barrier and dopaminergic neurons from functional damage. LPS significantly increased Evans blue content in the substantia nigra which peaked at 12 h, while administration of 3-AB significantly inhibited the LPS-induced increase in Evans blue content and also significantly increased the expression of the tight junction-associated proteins claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1. 3-AB also increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells and reduced the IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 content significantly. According to western blot analysis, 3-AB significantly reduced the p-ERK1/2 expression, while the expression of p-p38MAPK increased. These results suggest that 3-AB protects the blood-brain barrier from functional damage in an LPS-induced PD rat model and dopaminergic neurons are protected from degeneration by upregulation of tight junction-associated proteins. These protective effects of 3-AB may be related to modulation of the ERK1/2 pathway.",

    "abstract": "The H1 haplotype of the MAPT gene influences the risk of PD and has been related to the development of PDD. We evaluated the influence of MAPT haplotypes on the expression of motor features in PD patients. We genotyped, for the MAPT haplotypes H1 and H2, a sample of 181 PD patients with distinct clinical subtypes: tremor dominant and non-tremor dominant (NTD). Our results indicate that the MAPT haplotypes contribute to the expression of motor features of PD. H1 homozygous PD patients are significantly more likely to present a NTD phenotype, a clinical subtype characterized by widespread pathological degeneration, than H2 carriers.",

    "abstract": "To compare the efficacy and safety of levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone (LCE) with levodopa/carbidopa (LC) on Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with mild, or only minimally disabling motor complications. A prospective 3-month, multicentre, parallel-group, double-blind, and randomised phase IV study was performed. The primary endpoint was to assess the efficacy of LCE compared to LC on ADLs using the UPDRS part II. Secondary endpoints were assessed by the UPDRS (I, III and IV) scores, QUICK and PDQ-39 questionnaires, and patient and investigator clinical global impression (CGI). Ninety-five patients were randomly assigned to treatment with LCE (100/25/200 or 150/37.5/200\u00a0mg tablets, n\u00a0=\u00a046) or LC (100/25\u00a0mg tablets, n\u00a0=\u00a049), at the same levodopa dose that were administered before randomization. Treatment with LCE resulted in significantly greater improvement in UPDRS part II (ADLs) scores compared to treatment with LC (adjusted mean difference between groups of -1.5 points) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0288). Amelioration was also observed in UPDRS part III scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.010), and CGI (patient and investigator) scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.015, and p\u00a0=\u00a00.028, respectively). LCE and LC were generally well tolerated with 78\u00a0% of subjects completing the study. Most AEs (50\u00a0% in LCE and 71.4\u00a0% in LC) were classified as mild. No serious AEs were related to the treatment. Treatment with LCE results in improved efficacy compared to LC in PD patients with mild, or minimally disabling motor fluctuations, maintaining a good safety and tolerability profile.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays an important role in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Disruptions in the physiologic maintenance of the redox potential in neurons interfere with several biological processes, ultimately leading to cell death. Evidence has been developed for oxidative and nitrative damage to key cellular components in the PD substantia nigra. A number of sources and mechanisms for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are recognized including the metabolism of dopamine itself, mitochondrial dysfunction, iron, neuroinflammatory cells, calcium, and aging. PD causing gene products including DJ-1, PINK1, parkin, alpha-synuclein and LRRK2 also impact in complex ways mitochondrial function leading to exacerbation of ROS generation and susceptibility to oxidative stress. Additionally, cellular homeostatic processes including the ubiquitin-proteasome system and mitophagy are impacted by oxidative stress. It is apparent that the interplay between these various mechanisms contributes to neurodegeneration in PD as a feed forward scenario where primary insults lead to oxidative stress, which damages key cellular pathogenetic proteins that in turn cause more ROS production. Animal models of PD have yielded some insights into the molecular pathways of neuronal degeneration and highlighted previously unknown mechanisms by which oxidative stress contributes to PD. However, therapeutic attempts to target the general state of oxidative stress in clinical trials have failed to demonstrate an impact on disease progression. Recent knowledge gained about the specific mechanisms related to PD gene products that modulate ROS production and the response of neurons to stress may provide targeted new approaches towards neuroprotection.",

    "abstract": "Gait impairment is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and may result in greater energy expenditure, poorer walking economy, and fatigue during activities of daily living. Auditory cueing is an effective technique to improve gait; but the effects on energy expenditure are unknown.\nTo determine whether energy expenditure differs in individuals with PD compared with healthy controls and if auditory cueing improves walking economy in PD.\nTwenty participants (10 PD and 10 controls) came to the laboratory for three sessions. Participants performed two, 6-minute bouts of treadmill walking at two speeds (1.12 m\u00b7sec-1 and 0.67 m\u00b7sec-1). One session used cueing and the other without cueing. A metabolic cart measured energy expenditure and walking economy was calculated (energy expenditure/power).\nPD had worse walking economy and higher energy expenditure than control participants during cued and non-cued walking at the 0.67 m\u00b7sec-1 speed and during non-cued walking at the 1.12 m\u00b7sec-1. With auditory cueing, energy expenditure and walking economy worsened in both participant groups.\nPeople with PD use more energy and have worse walking economy than adults without PD. Walking economy declines further with auditory cuing in persons with PD.",

    "abstract": "Vascular parkinsonism (VP) may occur as a distinct clinicopathological entity but the comorbid presence of vascular damage in Parkinson's disease (PD) is very frequent too. This differential diagnosis has therapeutic and prognostic implications but remains challenging as the usefulness of a number of supporting tools is still controversial.\nTo ascertain the clinical value of cardiac (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) SPECT, olfactory function and (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT as supporting tools in the differential diagnosis between VP and PD.\nCross-sectional study of 15 consecutive patients with suspected VP, 15 PD patients and 9 healthy subjects. Cardiac (123)I-MIBG SPECT (heart-to-mediastinum ratio) and olfactory testing (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test-UPSIT) were performed in all of them. (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT was performed in VP-suspected patients.\nHeart-to-mediatinum ratio was significant lower in suspected VP (mean 1.45) and PD (mean 1.16) compared to control group (mean 1.69) (p = 0.017 and p < 0.0001). VP patients presented a higher ratio than PD patients (p = 0.001). Control group presented a significant higher UPSIT score (mean 30.71) when compared to both VP (mean 18.33) and PD (mean 15.29) (p = 0.001 for both groups). Those VP with a cardiac (123)I-MIBG non suggestive of PD were more likely to have a higher UPSIT score (p = 0.006). (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT imaging was heterogeneous (7/15 VP normal, 3/15 abnormal suggestive of PD and 5/15 abnormal but atypical for PD).\nThe use of cardiac (123)I-MIBG SPECT and to a lesser extent UPSIT could assist the differential diagnosis between VP and PD in subjects in which the diagnosis remains uncertain despite (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT imaging.",

    "abstract": "In school-based cardiovascular screening programs in Japan, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is diagnosed based on the presence of an electrocardiographic (ECG) delta wave without differentiation from the fasciculoventricular pathway (FVP), although the risk of sudden death is associated only with the former.\nThe purpose of this study was to differentiate FVP patients among children diagnosed with WPW syndrome by ECG.\nChildren who were diagnosed with WPW syndrome through school screening between April 2006 and March 2008 and had QRS width \u2264120 ms were included. Patients with asthma and/or coronary heart disease were excluded. FVP and WPW syndrome were differentiated based on ECG responses to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) injection. Age, PR interval, QRS width, and Rosenbaum classification were compared among patients.\nThirty patients (median age 12.7 years, range 6.5-15.7 years) participated in the study. FVP was diagnosed in 23 patients (76.7%), and WPW syndrome in 7 (23.3%). In Rosenbaum type A patients, all six patients had WPW syndrome, whereas FVP was diagnosed in 23 of 24 and WPW syndrome was diagnosed in 1 of 24 of type B patients. Age, PR interval, and QRS width were not significantly different between the two conditions.\nATP stress test was reliable in differentiating FVP from WPW syndrome. Although FVP is considered rare, the results of our study indicate that many WPW syndrome patients with QRS width \u2264120 ms may actually have FVP. Patients categorized as type B are more likely to have FVP, whereas type A patients are most likely to have WPW syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder typified by the presence of intraneuronal inclusions containing aggregated alpha synuclein (\u03b1syn). The progression of parkinsonian pathology and clinical phenotype has been broadly demonstrated to follow a specific pattern, most notably described by Braak and colleagues. In more recent times it has been hypothesized that \u03b1syn itself may be a critical factor in mediating transmission of disease pathology from one brain area to another. Here we investigate the growing body of evidence demonstrating the ability of \u03b1syn to spread transcellularly and induce pathological aggregation affecting neurons by permissive templating and provide a critical analysis of some irregularities in the hypothesis that the progression of PD pathology may be mediated by such a prion-like process. Finally we discuss some key questions that remain unanswered which are vital to determining the potential contribution of a prion-like process to the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the prevalence and clinical correlates of anhedonia in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to also examine the relationship between anhedonia and the QOL.\nOne hundred and seventeen patients with PD completed the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II), Starkstein's Apathy Scale (AS) and a quality of life (QOL) battery. Hoehn and Yahr (HY) staging, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were administered on the same day.\nAnhedonia (SHAPS score\u22653) was diagnosed in 15% of the patients. The SHAPS score was found to be significantly correlated with the HY stage and the UPDRS (I, IVB, IVC, total), BDI-II, AS and STAI (State, Trait) scores. A multivariate analysis revealed that the BDI-II and STAI (Trait) scores significantly influenced the SHAPS scores. The SHAPS scores were found to be negatively correlated with the QOL.\nThese findings indicate that anhedonia is associated with depression and anxiety. In addition, recognizing anhedonia in patients with PD is important since it may have a negative effect on the QOL.",

The level of vitamin D in Iranian patients with Parkinson's disease and its relationship with severity of symptoms and signs were evaluated in this study.\nEighty-three patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were recruited using simple non-random sampling. 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D3] was measured by Electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Serum level of calcium and phosphorus was measured to exclude other endocrine disorders.\nThe mean 25(OH)D3 concentration was lower in the PD population than in the normal group. Lower levels of 25(OH)D3 were associated with more severe postural instability and abnormal posture. There was no significant association between levels of 25(OH)D3 and severity of other symptoms of parkinsonism.\nThis analysis showed that serum 25(OH)D levels are lower in PD patients in comparison with normal range. In addition, there was a significant association between the presences of freezing, postural instability and abnormal postures with lower levels of 25(OH)D.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence implicates the relationship between neuroinflammation and pathogenesis in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD). The nose has recently been considered a gate way to the brain which facilitates entry of environmental neurotoxin into the brain. Our study aims to build a PD model by a natural exposure route. In this report, we establish a new endotoxin-based PD model in mice by unilateral intranasal (i.n.) instillation of the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) every other day for 5 months. These mice display a progressive hypokinesia, selective loss of dopaminergic neurons, and reduction in striatal dopamine (DA) content, as well as \u03b1-synuclein aggregation in the SN, without systemic inflammatory and immune responses. This new PD model provides a tool for studying the inflammation-mediated chronic pathogenesis and searching for therapeutic intervention in glia-neuron pathway that will slow or halt neurodegeneration in PD.",

    "abstract": "We have shown that buspirone, a partial agonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptors, improves motor dysfunctions induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and haloperidol in rats. The present work extends these findings by investigating the role of 5-HT1A receptors on catalepsy-like immobilization in rats, a model of Parkinson's disease. Catalepsy was induced by unilateral infusion of 6-OH-dopamine (8 \u03bcg/2\u03bcL/rat) into the central region of the substantia nigra, compact part (SNc) and assayed by bar-test method 5, 60, 120 and 180 min after the drugs administration. The involvement of 5-HT1A receptors in 6-OHDA-induced catalepsy was studied through intraperitoneal (0.25, 0.5 and 1mg/Kg IP) and intrasubstantia nigra, compact part (10 \u03bcg/rat, intra-SNc) injection of 8-hydroxy-2-[di-n-propylamino] tetralin (8-OHDPAT) as well as administration of 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-pthalimmido) butyl] piperazine hydrobromide (0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/Kg, NAN-190, IP). NAN-190 (1 mg/Kg, IP) and 8-OHDPAT (1 mg/Kg, IP and 10 \u03bcg/rat, intra-SNc) increased and decreased 6-OHDA-induced catalepsy respectively. In normal (non 6-OHDA-lesioned) rats, NAN-190 (1 mg/Kg, IP) increased the elapsed time in bar-test while 8-OHDPAT did not produce any significant effect. The anticataleptic effect of 8-OHDPAT (1 mg/Kg, IP) was reversed markedly by co-injection with NAN-190 (1 mg/Kg, IP). These findings suggest that 5-HT1A receptors are involved in 6-OHDA-induced catalepsy-like immobilization.",

    "abstract": "To report the short-term (1 year) and long-term (5 years) outcome of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation operated upon under controlled general anaesthesia (GA).\n213 consecutive patients with PD were included between January 2000 and March 2009 and operated upon under a particular type of GA with close control of the level of sedation allowing intraoperative recordings. 188 patients were assessed 1 year postoperatively. 65 patients also completed the long-term observation period and were evaluated 5 years postoperatively.\nThe Unified PD Rating Scale III score in the 'Off drug--On stim' condition was improved at 1 year and 5 years by 61% and 37%, respectively, (p<0.001). Motor complications decreased at short-term and long-term by 68% and 65%, respectively, for dyskinesia and by 52% and 48%, respectively, for fluctuations, (p<0.001). Dopaminergic treatment could also be reduced at short-term and long-term by 46% and 49%, respectively (p<0.001). There was no significant modification of mood and cognition assessments (Mattis scale and Beck depression inventory) at 1 year and 5 years. Concerning the main adverse events related to the surgery, we report four haematomas (1.9%) with two deaths (0.9%), eight cases of transient confusion (3.7%) and no epileptic seizure.\nOur results confirm that STN stimulation performed under controlled GA is efficient and has similar short-term and long-term motor effects than intervention under local anaesthesia. Furthermore, this specific procedure is not associated with more adverse events. The success of such an intervention requires strict anaesthetic monitoring and accurate STN identification.",

    "abstract": "The authors examined associations of various sleep-disturbance symptoms with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in 153 adults with Parkinson's disease (PD). PD patients reported more snoring, sleep inadequacy, daytime somnolence, and sleep-maintenance problems than the general population. Symptoms having the broadest and strongest unique associations with generic HRQOL (eight scales; two composites of SF-36) were daytime somnolence (five scales; one composite), sleep initiation (eight scales; two composites), and awakening short of breath or with headache (six scales; two composites). Associations of selected sleep-disturbance symptoms--some unanticipated--suggest that assessing specific symptoms is worthwhile in clinical care.",

    "abstract": "The association between Parkinson's disease (PD) and uric acid levels has gained intensive interest in recent years. We applied meta-analysis to investigate serum uric acid levels in patients with PD in comparison with healthy controls.\nWe searched three electronic databases and reference lists up to January 2013. Two collaborators reviewed all the articles and data disagreement was resolved through discussion. Six studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis of uric acid levels in patients with PD in comparison with controls.\n1217 patients with PD and 1276 matched healthy controls.\nThe meta-analysis results showed that patients with PD had lower levels of uric acid than healthy controls (summary standardised mean difference (SMD)=-0.52, 95% CI (-0.72 to -0.31)). Further gender subgroup analysis (summary SMD=-0.56, 95% CI (-0.72 to -0.41) for women; summary SMD=-0.62, 95% CI (-0.94 to -0.31) for men) indicated lower uric acid levels in patients with PD than healthy controls in women and men.\nIt was found that patients with PD had lower serum levels of uric acid than healthy controls and this association was more significant in men than in women. More efforts are encouraged to explore the prognostic and therapeutic implications for PD of the present findings.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this study were to determine test-retest reliability and responsiveness of short-distance walking speed tests for persons with Parkinson disease (PD). Discriminant and convergent validity of walking speed tests were also examined.\nEighty-eight participants with PD (mean age, 66 years) with mild to moderate severity (stages 1-4 on the Hoehn and Yahr Scale) were tested on medications. Measures of activity included the comfortable and fast 10-m walk tests (CWT, FWT), 6-min walk test (6MWT), mini balance evaluations systems test (mini-BEST Test), fear of falling (FoF), and the Activity-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC). The mobility subsection of the PD quality of life-39 (PDQ39-M) served as a participation-based measure.\nTest-retest reliability was high for both walking speed measures (CWT, ICC(2,1) = 0.98; FWT, ICC(2,1) = 0.99). Minimal detectable change (MDC(95)) for the CWT and FWT was 0.09 m/s and 0.13 m/s respectively. Participants at Hoehn & Yahr levels 3/4 demonstrated significantly slower walking speed with the CWT and FWT than participants at Hoehn & Yahr levels 1 and 2 (P < .01). The CWT and FWT were both significantly (P \u2264 .002) correlated with all activity and participation-based measures.\nShort-distance walking speed tests are clinically useful measures for persons with PD. The CWT and FWT are highly reliable and responsive to change in persons with PD. Short distance walking speed can be used to discriminate differences in gait function between persons with mild and moderate PD severity. The CWT and FWT had moderate to strong associations with other activity and participation based measures demonstrating convergent validity.",

    "abstract": "The aging risk factor for Parkinson's disease is described in terms of specific disease markers including mitochondrial and gene dysfunctions relevant to energy metabolism. This review details evidence for the ability of nutritional agents to manage these aging risk factors. The combination of alpha lipoic acid, acetyl-l-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, and melatonin supports energy metabolism via carbohydrate and fatty acid utilization, assists electron transport and adenosine triphosphate synthesis, counters oxidative and nitrosative stress, and raises defenses against protein misfolding, inflammatory stimuli, iron, and other endogenous or xenobiotic toxins. These effects are supported by gene expression via the antioxidant response element (ARE; Keap/Nrf2 pathway), and by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), a transcription coactivator, which regulates gene expression for energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis, and maintains the structural integrity of mitochondria. The effectiveness and synergies of the combination against disease risks are discussed in relation to gene action, dopamine cell loss, and the accumulation and spread of pathology via misfolded alpha-synuclein. In addition there are potential synergies to support a neurorestorative role via glial derived neurotrophic factor expression.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is an idiopathic, slowly progressive disorder of the central nervous system characterized by resting tremor, muscular rigidity, slow and decreased movement (bradykinesia), and postural instability. Oral healthcare providers can expect to be called upon to care for patients with this progressively debilitating disease. To provide competent care to patients with Parkinson's disease, clinicians must understand the disease, its treatment and its impact on the patient's ability to undergo and respond to dental care. The successful prosthodontic management of a 74-year-old completely edentulous Parkinson's disease patient is presented, with the conclusion that a prosthodontic intervention may contribute to improvement in the quality of life of a Parkinson's disease patient.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 20% of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) report a positive family history. Yet, a large portion of causal and disease-modifying variants is still unknown. We used exome sequencing in two affected individuals from a family with late-onset familial PD followed by frequency assessment in 975 PD cases and 1014 ethnically-matched controls and linkage analysis to identify potentially causal variants. Based on the predicted penetrance and the frequencies, a variant in PLXNA4 proved to be the best candidate and PLXNA4 was screened for additional variants in 862 PD cases and 940 controls, revealing an excess of rare non-synonymous coding variants in PLXNA4 in individuals with PD. Although we cannot conclude that the variant in PLXNA4 is indeed the causative variant, these findings are interesting in the light of a surfacing role of axonal guidance mechanisms in neurodegenerative disorders but, at the same time, highlight the difficulties encountered in the study of rare variants identified by next-generation sequencing in diseases with autosomal dominant or complex patterns of inheritance.",

    "abstract": "Studies of bimanual actions similar to activities of daily living (ADLs) are currently lacking in evaluating fine motor control in Parkinson's disease patients implanted with bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulators. We investigated basic time and force characteristics of a bimanual task that resembles performance of ADLs in a group of bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) patients.\nPatients were evaluated in three different DBS parameter conditions off stimulation, on clinically derived stimulation parameters, and on settings derived from a patient-specific computational model. Model-based parameters were computed as a means to minimize spread of current to non-motor regions of the subthalamic nucleus via Cicerone Deep Brain Stimulation software. Patients were evaluated off parkinsonian medications in each stimulation condition.\nThe data indicate that DBS parameter state does not affect most aspects of fine motor control in ADL-like tasks; however, features such as increased grip force and grip symmetry varied with the stimulation state. In the absence of DBS parameters, patients exhibited significant grip force asymmetry. Overall UPDRS-III and UPDRS-III scores associated with hand function were lower while patients were experiencing clinically-derived or model-based parameters, as compared to the off-stimulation condition.\nWhile bilateral subthalamic DBS has been shown to alleviate gross motor dysfunction, our results indicate that DBS may not provide the same magnitude of benefit to fine motor coordination.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) defects are observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and in PD fly- and mouse-models; however it remains to be tested if acute improvement of ETC function alleviates PD-relevant defects. We tested the hypothesis that 808 nm infrared light that effectively penetrates tissues rescues pink1 mutants. We show that irradiating isolated fly or mouse mitochondria with 808 nm light that is absorbed by ETC-Complex IV acutely improves Complex IV-dependent oxygen consumption and ATP production, a feature that is wavelength-specific. Irradiating Drosophila pink1 mutants using a single dose of 808 nm light results in a rescue of major systemic and mitochondrial defects. Time-course experiments indicate mitochondrial membrane potential defects are rescued prior to mitochondrial morphological defects, also in dopaminergic neurons, suggesting mitochondrial functional defects precede mitochondrial swelling. Thus, our data indicate that improvement of mitochondrial function using infrared light stimulation is a viable strategy to alleviate pink1-related defects.",

    "abstract": "The merits of Tai Ji Quan in preventing or ameliorating chronic disease conditions are increasingly being explored in the biomedical research and clinical rehabilitation communities. Recent findings suggest that this ancient martial art's modality, when implemented as a complementary exercise regimen, can be therapeutically beneficial to people with neurodegenerative conditions. This article builds on a recent clinical trial that demonstrated the benefits of Tai Ji Quan for patients with Parkinson's disease by introducing an enhanced training approach that emphasizes integration of multiple facets of movement control mechanisms aimed at reducing or alleviating dysfunctional movement-related symptoms. This innovative approach to traditional Tai Ji Quan practice reflects the need for it to be adapted to modern behavioural medicine and the potential for it to fill a gap between research and clinical practice. The ultimate goal of this approach is to identify the extent of health benefits of Tai Ji Quan as an integrated and alternative intervention used to meet the increasing demand for adjunct clinical treatments for movement disorders and chronic disease prevention.",

METHODS MEASURES: of PD signs and symptoms, freezing of gait, balance, mobility, proprioception, leg muscle strength, and cognition were collected on 205 community-dwelling people with PD. Falls were monitored prospectively for 6 months using falls diaries.\nA total of 120 participants (59%) fell during follow-up. Freezing of gait (P < .001), dyskinesia (P = .02), impaired anticipatory and reactive balance (P < .001), impaired cognition (P = .002), reduced leg muscle strength (P = .006), and reduced proprioception (P = .04) were significantly associated with future falls in univariate analyses. Freezing of gait (risk ratio [RR] = 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.00-1.05, P = .02), impaired anticipatory (RR = 1.01, 95% CI = 1.00-1.02, P = .03) and reactive (RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.01-1.58, P = .04) balance, and impaired orientation (RR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.01-1.62, P = .04) maintained significant associations with falls in multivariate analysis.\nThe study findings elucidate important physical and cognitive determinants of falls in people with PD and may assist in developing efficacious fall prevention strategies for this high-risk group.",

    "abstract": "Differentiating the Parkinson variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P) from idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and other forms of atypical parkinsonism can be difficult because symptoms overlap considerably. 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a powerful imaging technique that can assist in the diagnosis of MSA-P via detection of putaminal and cerebellar hypometabolism. Recent studies suggest that diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) might be of similar diagnostic value, as it can detect microstructural damage in the putamen by means of an increased mean diffusivity (MD). The aim of this study was a direct comparison of DWI and FDG-PET by using both methods on the same subject cohort. To this end, combined DWI and FDG-PET were employed in patients with MSA-P (n = 11), PD (n = 13), progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 8), and in 6 control subjects. MD values and FDG uptake ratios were derived from volumetric parcellations of the putamen and subjected to further analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and receiver operating characteristics analyses. MSA-P was found to be associated with an increased posterior putaminal MD (P < 0.001 in all subgroup comparisons) that correlated strongly with local reductions in FDG uptake (r =\u2009-0.85, P = 0.002). DWI discriminated patients with MSA-P from other subgroups nearly as accurately as FDG-PET (area under the curve = 0.89 vs 0.95, P = 0.27 [pooled data]). Our data suggest a close association between the amount of putaminal microstructural damage and a reduced energy metabolism in patients with MSA-P. The clinical use of DWI for the differential diagnosis of MSA-P is encouraged.",

    "abstract": "An established treatment for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Mounting evidence suggests that PD is also associated with somatosensory deficits, yet the effect of STN-DBS on somatosensory processing is largely unknown. This study investigated whether STN-DBS affects somatosensory processing, specifically the processing of tactile and proprioceptive cues, by systematically examining the accuracy of haptic perception of object size. (Haptic perception refers to one's ability to extract object features such as shape and size by active touch.) Without vision, 13 PD patients with implanted STN-DBS and 13 healthy controls haptically explored the heights of 2 successively presented 3-dimensional (3D) blocks using a precision grip. Participants verbally indicated which block was taller and then used their nonprobing hand to motorically match the perceived size of the comparison block. Patients were tested during ON and OFF stimulation, following a 12-hour medication washout period. First, when compared to controls, the PD group's haptic discrimination threshold during OFF stimulation was elevated by 192% and mean hand aperture error was increased by 105%. Second, DBS lowered the haptic discrimination threshold by 26% and aperture error decreased by 20%. Third, during DBS ON, probing with the motorically more affected hand decreased haptic precision compared to probing with the less affected hand. This study offers the first evidence that STN-DBS improves haptic precision, further indicating that somatosensory function is improved by STN-DBS. We conclude that DBS-related improvements are not explained by improvements in motor function alone, but rather by enhanced somatosensory processing.",

    "abstract": "The phenotype of Parkinson's disease (PD) in patients with and without leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) G2019S mutations reportedly is similar; however, large, uniformly evaluated series are lacking. The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical phenotype of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) PD carriers of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. We studied 553 AJ PD patients, including 65 patients who were previously reported, from three sites (two in New York and one in Tel-Aviv). Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutation carriers were excluded. Evaluations included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS) questionnaire. Regression models were constructed to test the association between clinical and demographic features and LRRK2 status (outcome) in 488 newly recruited participants. LRRK2 G2019S carriers (n\u2009=\u200997) and non-carriers (n\u2009=\u2009391) were similar in age and age at onset of PD. Carriers had longer disease duration (8.6 years vs. 6.1 years; P\u2009<\u20090.001), were more likely to be women (51.5% vs. 37.9%; P\u2009=\u20090.015), and more often reported first symptoms in the lower extremities (40.0% vs. 19.2%; P\u2009<\u20090.001). In logistic models that were adjusted for age, disease duration, sex, education, and site, carriers were more likely to have lower extremity onset (P\u2009<\u20090.001), postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) (P\u2009=\u20090.043), and a persistent levodopa response for >5 years (P\u2009=\u20090.042). Performance on the UPDRS, MoCA, GDS, and NMS did not differ by mutation status. PD in AJ LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers is similar to idiopathic PD but is characterized by more frequent lower extremity involvement at onset and PIGD without the associated cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 20\u00a0% of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) report a positive family history. Yet, a large portion of causal and disease-modifying variants is still unknown. We used exome sequencing in two affected individuals from a family with late-onset PD to identify 15 potentially causal variants. Segregation analysis and frequency assessment in 862 PD cases and 1,014 ethnically matched controls highlighted variants in EEF1D and LRRK1 as the best candidates. Mutation screening of the coding regions of these genes in 862 cases and 1,014 controls revealed several novel non-synonymous variants in both genes in cases and controls. An in silico multi-model bioinformatics analysis was used to prioritize identified variants in LRRK1 for functional follow-up. However, protein expression, subcellular localization, and cell viability were not affected by the identified variants. Although it has yet to be proven conclusively that variants in LRRK1 are indeed causative of PD, our data strengthen a possible role for LRRK1 in addition to LRRK2 in the genetic underpinnings of PD but, at the same time, highlight the difficulties encountered in the study of rare variants identified by next-generation sequencing in diseases with autosomal dominant or complex patterns of inheritance.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease primarily affects the central nervous system, but autopsy and small patient studies have revealed autonomic nervous system pathology in most cases. We looked for \u03b1-synuclein pathology in routinely acquired biopsies from patients and matched controls. Immunocytochemistry was performed and assessed blind to the clinical diagnoses. One hundred and seventeen gastrointestinal tissue samples from 62 patients, and 161 samples from 161 controls, were examined. Twelve biopsies from seven patients showed accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein within mucosal and submucosal nerve fibres, and ganglia, which was more extensive with an antibody to phosphorylated, than with an antibody to non-phosphorylated, \u03b1-synuclein. These included gastric, duodenal and colonic biopsies, and were taken up to 8\u00a0years prior to the onset of motor symptoms. All patients with positive biopsies had early autonomic symptoms and all controls were negative. This large scale study demonstrates that accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in the gastrointestinal tract is a highly specific finding that could be used to confirm a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. We have shown that \u03b1-synuclein accumulation occurs prior to the onset of motor symptoms in the upper, as well as the lower gastrointestinal tract, remains present in serial biopsies until the onset of motor symptoms and is predominantly composed of phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein. Accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in the bowel therefore offers an accessible biomarker which allows further study of the early stages of the disease and could be of value in the assessment of disease modifying treatments.",

    "abstract": "Depression and impulse control disorders (ICD) are two common neuropsychiatric features in Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies have revealed that both phenomena are associated with aberrations in ventral striatal dopamine signaling and concomitant dysfunction of the reward-related (limbic) cortico-striatal-thalamocortical (CSTC) circuit. Depression in PD seems associated with decreased activity in the limbic CSTC circuit, whereas ICD seem associated with increased limbic CSTC circuit activity, usually after commencing dopamine replacement therapy (DRT). Not all DRT using PD patients, however, develop symptoms of ICD, suggesting an additional underlying neurobiological susceptibility. Furthermore, the symptoms of depression and ICD frequently coincide even though they are related to seemingly contrasting limbic CSTC circuit activation states. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the currently available literature on the neurobiology of PD-related depression and ICD and discusses possible susceptibility factors. Finally, we propose a neurobiological model that identifies ventral striatal dopaminergic denervation as a common underlying neurobiological substrate of depression and ICD and subsequent dysfunction of reward and motivation-related brain areas.",

Ratings by the participants indicated progression throughout the training period. All participants considered the training motivational and stated that they would recommend it to others. The efficacy of the intervention measured with the Mini-BESTest showed that 4 out of 5 participants improved their balance performance.\nThese findings support the overall feasibility of this novel balance program in older adults with mild to moderate PD. However, to further evaluate the efficacy of the program, a larger randomized controlled trial is required.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have hypovitaminosis D status and genetic variants of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene are recently shown to be associated with PD in a large-scale genome-wide association study in a Caucasian population. Few studies examined VDR genetic variants in large-scale Asian patients with PD. We therefore genotyped 6 VDR genetic variants in a total of 1492 Taiwanese subjects, including 700 patients with PD and 792 age and/or gender matched control subjects. We did not observe any significant associations between the studied genetic variants of VDR and the risk of PD. Our data suggest that genetic variations of the VDR gene did not play a major role in a Taiwanese PD population. Further studies of VDR and its interaction with serum vitamin D levels are warranted to clarify the potential role of vitamin D in PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Expression of the human Parkinson-disease-associated protein \u03b1-synuclein in all Drosophila neurons induces progressive locomotor deficits. Here, we identify a group of 15 dopaminergic neurons per hemisphere in the anterior medial region of the brain whose disruption correlates with climbing impairments in this model. These neurons selectively innervate the horizontal \u03b2 and \u03b2' lobes of the mushroom bodies, and their connections to the Kenyon cells are markedly reduced when they express \u03b1-synuclein. Using selective mushroom body drivers, we show that blocking or overstimulating neuronal activity in the \u03b2' lobe, but not the \u03b2 or \u03b3 lobes, significantly inhibits negative geotaxis behavior. This suggests that modulation of the mushroom body \u03b2' lobes by this dopaminergic pathway is specifically required for an efficient control of startle-induced locomotion in flies.",

    "abstract": "Disturbances of the circadian timing system following daylight saving time (DST) may influence the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). To address this question, we compared the severity of motor fluctuations and non-motor symptoms both before and after the time change. Total daily \"off-time\" based on diaries, excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory), and psychosis associated with PD were assessed both before and after the DST. Eighty-three PD patients (mean age, 67\u00b17.7years; mean disease duration, 10.4\u00b16.4years) were included. Thirty-six patients had motor fluctuations (mean daily \"off-time\", 4.8\u00b12.4h/day). There was no significant variation of the total daily \"off-time\" (2.5\u00b12.6h/day versus 2.5\u00b12.7h/day), ESS (8.3\u00b14.8 versus 8.1\u00b14.9), BDI (10.4\u00b16.2 versus 10.0\u00b16.9), or PAPD (1.4\u00b11.6 versus 1.1\u00b11.6) scores (P>0.05) after DST. Our results suggest that PD patients cope relatively well with DST.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, involving the dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic and cholinergic systems. In addition to its cardinal motor symptoms, PD is associated with a diverse range of non-motor symptoms (NMS) that may be more important than motor symptoms. Although there is evidence for a dopaminergic contribution for several NMS in PD, NMS have been underrecognized and undertreated by clinicians. There is evidence that dopaminergic therapy, including dopamine agonists, may alleviate some NMS, such as anxiety and depression. This review focuses on published data on the effects of the non-ergoline dopaminergic agonist rotigotine transdermal system in the treatment of NMS in patients with PD. Data on the effects of orally administered non-ergoline agonists, including ropinirole and pramipexole, on NMS are also summarized.",

    "abstract": "Psychopharmacotherapy currently constitutes the first-line treatment for depression and anxiety in Parkinson's disease (PD) however the efficacy of antidepressant treatments in PD is unclear. Several alternative treatments have been suggested as potentially more viable alternatives including dopamine agonists, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\nA meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials for depression and/or anxiety in PD was conducted to systematically examine the efficacy of current treatments for depression and anxiety in PD.\nNine trials were included. There was only sufficient data to calculate a pooled effect for antidepressant therapies. The pooled effect of antidepressants for depression in PD was moderate but non-significant (d = .71, 95% CI = -1.33 to 3.08). The secondary effect of antidepressants on anxiety in PD was large but also non-significant (d = 1.13, 95% CI = -.67 to 2.94). Two single-trials of non-pharmacological treatments for depression in PD resulted in significant large effects; Omega-3 supplementation (d = .92, 95% CI = .15 to 1.69) and CBT (d = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.06 to 2.07), and warrant further exploration.\nThere remains a lack of controlled trials for both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for depression and anxiety in PD which limits the conclusions which can be drawn. While the pooled effects of antidepressant therapies in PD were non-significant, the moderate to large magnitude of each pooled effect is promising. Non-pharmacological approaches show potential for depression in PD however more research is required.",

    "abstract": "Insomnia and daytime sleepiness are common complaints in Parkinson disease (PD), but the main causes remain unclear. We examined the potential impact of both motor and non-motor symptoms of PD on sleep problems.\nPatients with PD (n = 128) were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Fatigue Severity Scale, Survey of Autonomic Symptoms, and the 39-item Parkinson Disease Questionnaire. A subset of subjects (n = 38, 30%) also completed nocturnal polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).\nMultivariate stepwise logistic regression models revealed that subjective insomnia was independently associated with depressed mood (odds ratio [OR] = 1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.01-3.19]), autonomic symptoms (1.77 [1.08-2.90]), fatigue (1.19 [1.02-1.38]), and age (0.61 [0.39-0.96]). Subjective daytime sleepiness was associated with dosage of dopaminergic medication (1.74 [1.08-2.80]) and fatigue (1.14 [1.02-1.28]). On polysomnography, longer sleep latency correlated with autonomic symptoms (rho = 0.40, p = 0.01) and part I (non-motor symptoms) of the Unified PD Rating Scale (rho = 0.38, p = 0.02). Decreased sleep efficiency correlated with autonomic symptoms (rho = -0.42, p < 0.0001). However, no significant difference emerged on polysomnography and MSLTs between patients with or without insomnia or daytime sleepiness. Higher rates of apneic events did predict shorter sleep latencies on the MSLTs.\nNon-motor symptoms appear to be associated with subjective insomnia, whereas fatigue and dopaminergic medication are associated with subjective daytime sleepiness. Objective sleep laboratory data provided little insight into complaints of insomnia and sleepiness, though obstructive sleep apnea predicted worsened sleepiness when measured objectively.",

    "abstract": "Alternation of walking pattern decreases quality of life and may result in falls and injuries. Freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients occurs occasionally and intermittently, appearing in a random, inexplicable manner. In order to detect typical disturbances during walking, we designed an expert system for automatic classification of various gait patterns. The proposed method is based on processing of data obtained from an inertial sensor mounted on shank. The algorithm separates normal from abnormal gait using Pearson's correlation and describes each stride by duration, shank displacement, and spectral components. A rule-based data processing classifies strides as normal, short (short(+)) or very short (short(-)) strides, FOG with tremor (FOG(+)) or FOG with complete motor block (FOG(-)). The algorithm also distinguishes between straight and turning strides. In 12 PD patients, FOG(+) and FOG(-) were identified correctly in 100% of strides, while normal strides were recognized in 95% of cases. Short(+) and short(-) strides were identified in about 84% and 78%. Turning strides were correctly identified in 88% of cases. The proposed method may be used as an expert system for detailed stride classification, providing warning for severe FOG episodes and near-fall situations.",

    "abstract": "Managing gait disturbances in people with Parkinson's disease is a pressing challenge, as symptoms can contribute to injury and morbidity through an increased risk of falls. While drug-based interventions have limited efficacy in alleviating gait impairments, certain nonpharmacological methods, such as cueing, can also induce transient improvements to gait. The approach adopted here is to use computationally-generated sounds to help guide and improve walking actions. The first method described uses recordings of force data taken from the steps of a healthy adult which in turn were used to synthesize realistic gravel-footstep sounds that represented different spatio-temporal parameters of gait, such as step duration and step length. The second method described involves a novel method of sonifying, in real time, the swing phase of gait using real-time motion-capture data to control a sound synthesis engine. Both approaches explore how simple but rich auditory representations of action based events can be used by people with Parkinson's to guide and improve the quality of their walking, reducing the risk of falls and injury. Studies with Parkinson's disease patients are reported which show positive results for both techniques in reducing step length variability. Potential future directions for how these sound approaches can be used to manage gait disturbances in Parkinson's are also discussed.",

Disease severity was assessed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn & Yahr grade at 'On stage'. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood cells. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were used to detect COMT mutations. Data were analyzed by SPSS 18.0. False discovery rate (FDR) or Bonferroni correction was used if the result showed P\u00a0<\u00a00.05.\nFour COMT mutations were detected in 199 subjects: rs74745580 (only in two patients with primary PD), rs4633, rs6267, and rs3838146. There were no statistical differences in frequencies of rs4633, rs6267, and rs3838146 genotypes between PD patients and the control group. The frequency of allele rs4633T was higher in PD patients than in the control group.

    "abstract": "Genetic and epidemiologic evidence suggests that cellular energy homeostasis is critically associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Here we demonstrated that genetic deletion of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 completely blocked 6-hydroxydopamine-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration and related PD-like symptoms. Hyperactivation of PARP-1 depleted ATP pools in dopaminergic (DA) neurons, thereby activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Further, blockade of AMPK activation by viral infection with dominant-negative AMPK strongly inhibited DA neuronal atrophy with moderate suppression of nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inhibiting factor (AIF), whereas overactivation of AMPK conversely strengthened the 6-OHDA-induced DA neuronal degeneration. Collectively, these results suggest that manipulation of PARP-1 and AMPK signaling is an effective therapeutic approach to prevent PD-related DA neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Loss-of-function in the Parkin protein is thought to play a part in causing neuronal cell death in patients with Parkinson's disease. This study explores the effect of Parkin degradation, via the overexpression of nucleus accumbens 1 (NAC1), on cell viability. It was found that NAC1 and Parkin are co-localized within the cell and interact with one another, leading to a decrease in Parkin levels. Moreover, NAC1 down-regulates Parkin by presenting it for ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation, which causes a decrease in proteasomal activity in neuronal cells. Consequently, this decrease in proteasomal activity leads to an increase in the cells' susceptibility to proteasome inhibition-induced toxicity. It was also found that Parkin and NAC1 are key proteins found to be present mainly in the cytoplasm and are co-localized in neurons of Parkinson's disease patients. Interestingly, mutation in the POZ/BTB domain (Q23L) of NAC1 disrupts the co-localization and interaction of NAC1 with Parkin and it further abrogates the proteasome inhibition-induced toxicity. We further observed that co-transfection of the mutant form of NAC1 with Parkin reversed the proteasome activity and 20S proteasome protein levels. These results indicate a novel interaction between NAC1 and Parkin that leads to neuronal cell death, a main characteristic in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The beneficial effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for the motor symptoms in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) are well established. Early in PD, mild cognitive impairment is present in a proportion of patients. Hence, it can also be present in PD patients considered for DBS. The potential impact of even a modest decline post-surgically is a concern because it could result in impaired cognitive function. Therefore, attempts to determine which pre-operative cognitive measures predict post-operative cognitive change warrant further attention. We report our findings in a cohort of 30 routinely operated non-demented patients who underwent detailed neuropsychological assessments on average 7.1 months before and 9.4 months after STN DBS. We report the individual and group differences pre- and post-DBS. Stepwise regression analysis was used to analyse the best cognitive predictors of post-operative cognitive changes. We describe our data in relation to published normative data. Post-STN DBS, the immediate story recall component of verbal memory was the most affected cognitive function showing a significant decline in its group mean with a large effect size. The best predictors for this change were pre-surgical list learning and Full Scale Intelligence Quotient. These results suggest that non-demented patients, with even mild impairments in both general intellectual functions and list learning, may be at greater risk of decline in other aspects of verbal memory after STN DBS. Pre-existing mild executive dysfunction was not influenced post-operatively. These findings may help selection and consent for STN DBS.",

    "abstract": "This study used resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) to evaluate regional and network alterations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with and without depression.\nWe recruited 29 patients with PD with depression (PD-Dep), 30 patients with PD without depression (PD-NDep), and 30 normal controls. All participants underwent resting-state fMRI scans on a 3-T MR system. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of blood oxygen level-dependent signals was used to characterise regional cerebral function. Functional integration of the brain network was evaluated by seed-based correlation approach.\nThe PD-Dep group showed significantly higher ALFF value in the left orbitofrontal area compared with both the PD-NDep and control groups (p<0.05 corrected by FWE). In patients with PD, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was positively correlated with the ALFF value in the left orbitofrontal cortex (p<0.005 uncorrected). Brain network connectivity analysis revealed reduced functional connectivity of putamen in both PD subgroups. However, the PD-Dep group showed more distributed reduced connectivity in the prefrontal-limbic network than the PD-NDep group did (p<0.05 corrected by FWE).\nOur study demonstrates that PD-Dep patients are characterised by increased regional spontaneous neural activity in the orbitofrontal area and decreased functional integration within the prefrontal-limbic network. These findings may be helpful for facilitating further understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying depression in PD.",

    "abstract": "There is a cholinergic deficit in Parkinson disease (PD) and in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) that plays a role in a variety of clinical symptoms, including visual hallucinations (VH). The aim of this study was to assess cholinergic neuronal loss and PD and Alzheimer disease pathology in the pedunculopontine nucleus pars compacta (PPNc) of PD and DLB patients with VH. Postmortem brainstem tissue samples of 9 clinically diagnosed and pathologically confirmed PD patients with VH, 9 DLB patients with VH, and 9 age- and sex-matched nondemented controls were obtained from the Netherlands Brain Bank. Using a morphometric approach, we estimated the density of cholinergic neurons in the PPNc and determined the local load of \u03b1-synuclein-immunoreactive Lewy pathology, neurofibrillary tangles, and \u03b2-amyloid plaques. Cholinergic cell density in the PPNc was significantly lower in PD compared with DLB patients with VH (-39%, p < 0.001) and controls (-41%, p < 0.001). Alpha-synuclein load was higher in PD, whereas \u03b2-amyloid plaque pathology was more pronounced in DLB patients. The mean cell density in DLB patients was not significantly reduced compared with that in controls. These results may indicate different patterns of degeneration of cholinergic output structures in PD and DLB.",

    "abstract": "The leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2/dardarin) is implicated in autosomal dominant familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD); mutations in LRRK2 account for up to 40% of PD cases in some populations. LRRK2 is a large protein with a kinase domain, a GTPase domain, and multiple potential protein interaction domains. As such, delineating the functional pathways for LRRK2 and mechanisms by which PD-linked variants contribute to age-related neurodegeneration could result in pharmaceutically tractable therapies. A growing number of recent studies implicate dysregulation of mitogen activated protein kinases 3 and 1 (also known as ERK1/2) as possible downstream mediators of mutant LRRK2 effects. As these master regulators of growth, differentiation, neuronal plasticity and cell survival have also been implicated in other PD models, a set of common cell biological pathways may contribute to neuronal susceptibility in PD. Here, we review the literature on several major cellular pathways impacted by LRRK2 mutations--autophagy, microtubule/cytoskeletal dynamics, and protein synthesis--in context of potential signaling crosstalk involving the ERK1/2 and Wnt signaling pathways. Emerging implications for calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial biology and synaptic dysregulation are discussed in relation to LRRK2 interactions with other PD gene products. It has been shown that substantia nigra neurons in human PD and Lewy body dementia patients exhibit cytoplasmic accumulations of ERK1/2 in mitochondria, autophagosomes and bundles of intracellular fibrils. Both experimental and human tissue data implicate pathogenic changes in ERK1/2 signaling in sporadic, toxin-based and mutant LRRK2 settings, suggesting engagement of common cell biological pathways by divergent PD etiologies.",

    "abstract": "Free recall memory deficits are common in Parkinson's disease (PD), even at early stages before mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Their association with brain structural changes has not been established.\nWe studied local gray matter volumes in relation to different memory tasks in early stage PD.\nMagnetic resonance images (MRI) and neuropsychological data were obtained from 28 non-demented, medicated PD patients, and 28 healthy controls. The gray matter segments of T1-weighted MRI images were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry in relation to visual and verbal memory tasks. Measures of immediate free recall, verbal learning, delayed recall and memory consolidation were obtained. A novel measure of incidental memory was included.\nPatients and controls showed no significant group differences in local gray matter volumes. Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed that worse performance on an incidental visual memory task was associated with smaller right parietal gray matter volume (Family-wise error corrected P = 0.002). This association was present in the PD group (corrected P = 0.005), but not in controls (corrected P > 0.99). No associations between gray matter volumes and the other memory tasks were found in either group.\nThe results suggest that right parietal cortical gray matter volume is related to free recall memory deficits in early stage PD in conditions not involving an intention to memorize visual items. This preliminary finding needs to be established in further studies utilizing incidental memory tasks in PD.",

    "abstract": "Animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) have shown that key mechanisms of cortical plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) can be impaired by the PD pathology. In humans protocols of non-invasive brain stimulation, such as paired associative stimulation (PAS) and theta-burst stimulation (TBS), can be used to investigate cortical plasticity of the primary motor cortex. Through the amplitude of the motor evoked potential these transcranial magnetic stimulation methods allow to measure both LTP-like and LTD-like mechanisms of cortical plasticity. So far these protocols have reported some controversial findings when tested in PD patients. While various studies described evidence for reduced LTP- and LTD-like plasticity, others showed different results, demonstrating increased LTP-like and normal LTD-like plasticity. Recent evidence provided support to the hypothesis that these different patterns of cortical plasticity likely depend on the stage of the disease and on the concomitant administration of l-DOPA. However, it is still unclear how and if these altered mechanisms of cortical plasticity can be taken as a reliable model to build appropriate protocols aimed at treating PD symptoms by applying repetitive sessions of repetitive TMS (rTMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The current article will provide an up-to-date overview of these issues together with some reflections on future studies in the field.",

    "abstract": "The oculomotor role of the basal ganglia has been supported by extensive evidence, although their role in scanning eye movements is poorly understood. Nineteen Parkinso\u0144s disease patients, which underwent implantation of deep brain stimulation electrodes, were investigated with simultaneous intraoperative microelectrode recordings and single channel electrooculography in a scanning eye movement task by viewing a series of colored pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System. Four patients additionally underwent a visually guided saccade task. Microelectrode recordings were analyzed selectively from the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra pars reticulata and from the globus pallidus by the WaveClus program which allowed for detection and sorting of individual neurons. The relationship between neuronal firing rate and eye movements was studied by crosscorrelation analysis. Out of 183 neurons that were detected, 130 were found in the subthalamic nucleus, 30 in the substantia nigra and 23 in the globus pallidus. Twenty percent of the neurons in each of these structures showed eye movement-related activity. Neurons related to scanning eye movements were mostly unrelated to the visually guided saccades. We conclude that a relatively large number of basal ganglia neurons are involved in eye motion control. Surprisingly, neurons related to scanning eye movements differed from neurons activated during saccades suggesting functional specialization and segregation of both systems for eye movement control.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment (CI) is a frequent feature associated with both early and advanced stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). An evaluation of cognitive functions is relevant to identify those parkinsonians at risk of developing dementia. In the present study, the Italian version of Parkinson's Disease-Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS) assessing fronto-subcortical and cortical cognitive functions in PD was validated in 387 parkinsonians and was used to test the empirical validity of the item 1.1 (cognitive impairment) of the Italian version of MDS-UPDRS as screening tool for CI in PD. PD-CRS was free from floor and ceiling effect. The mean PD-CRS score was 76.1 (mean cortical score, 24.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6; mean subcortical score, 51.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.5). The internal consistency was satisfactory (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.89); corrected item-total correlation was 0.570 (naming) to 0.696 (working memory). The correlation between PD-CRS and part I-IV of MDS-UPDRS was weak. The low agreement between classification of PD sample into patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), dementia (PD-D) and normal cognition (PD-NC) according to scores of item 1.1 and classification according to cutoff scores of PD-CRS for PD-MCI, PD-D and PD-NC indicated a poor empirical validity of item 1.1 of MDS-UPDRS as cognitive screening tool for CI in PD (\u039a\u00a0=\u00a00.114; weighted \u039a\u00a0=\u00a00.17; SE of \u039a\u00a0=\u00a00.038; 95\u00a0% confidence interval from 0.040 to 0.1895). The Italian version of PD-CRS is an easy, consistent and valid tool for assessment of the cognitive cortical and subcortical impairments in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer disease with a lifetime risk in the UK population of almost 5%. An association between PD and Gaucher disease (GD) derived from the observation that GD patients and their heterozygous carrier relatives were at increased risk of PD. GD is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by homozygous mutations in the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase (GBA). Approximately 5%-10% of PD patients have GBA mutations, making these mutations numerically the most important genetic predisposing risk factor for the development of PD identified to date. GBA mutations result in a phenotype that is virtually indistinguishable clinically, pharmacologically, and pathologically from sporadic PD, except GBA mutations result in a slightly earlier age of onset and more frequent cognitive impairment among PD patients. The mechanisms by which GBA mutations result in PD are not yet understood. Both reduced glucocerebrosidase enzyme (GCase) activity with lysosomal dysfunction, and unfolded protein response (UPR) with endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) and stress are considered contributory.",

    "abstract": "Even with optimal dopaminergic treatments, many patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are frequently incapacitated by apathy prior to the development of dementia. We sought to establish whether rivastigmine's ability to inhibit acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterases could relieve the symptoms of apathy in dementia-free, non-depressed patients with advanced PD.\nWe performed a multicentre, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial (Protocol ID: 2008-002578-36; clinicaltrials.gov reference: NCT00767091) in patients with PD with moderate to severe apathy (despite optimised dopaminergic treatment) and without dementia. Patients from five French university hospitals were randomly assigned 1:1 to rivastigmine (transdermal patch of 9.5 mg/day) or placebo for 6 months. The primary efficacy criterion was the change over time in the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) score.\n101 consecutive patients were screened, 31 were eligible and 16 and 14 participants were randomised into the rivastigmine and placebo groups, respectively. Compared with placebo, rivastigmine improved the LARS score (from -11.5 (-15/-7) at baseline to -20 (-25/-12) after treatment; F(1, 25)=5.2; p=0.031; adjusted size effect: -0.9). Rivastigmine also improved the caregiver burden and instrumental activities of daily living but failed to improve quality of life. No severe adverse events occurred in the rivastigmine group.\nRivastigmine may represent a new therapeutic option for moderate to severe apathy in advanced PD patients with optimised dopaminergic treatment and without depression dementia. These findings require confirmation in a larger clinical trial. Our results also confirmed that the presence of apathy can herald a pre-dementia state in PD.\nClinicaltrials.gov reference: NCT00767091.",

    "abstract": "To compare the clinical judgment of experienced neurologists after interviewing Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and their caregivers with the use of the Pill Questionnaire to determine the presence of impairments on activities of daily living (ADL).\nADL impairment is a criterion for the diagnosis of dementia associated with PD. The Pill Questionnaire has been recommended as a screening tool to assess ADL impairment in PD patients, but its usefulness and validity have not been fully investigated.\nWe recruited idiopathic PD patients from 12 hospitals in Taiwan, and the patients underwent clinical assessments, a neuropsychological test battery and the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale evaluation. The Pill Questionnaire was administered by study assistants. Patient and caregiver interviews were performed by experienced neurologists who were blinded to the Pill Questionnaire results.\nIn total, 284 PD patients (mean age 71.8\u00b19 years, mean education 8.7\u00b15.3 years, mean disease duration 5.4\u00b15.3 years) were recruited. 63 patients showed ADL impairment by the Pill Questionnaire, and 108 patients showed ADL impairment by neurologists' clinical interviews. \u03ba Statistics showed moderate agreement between the two methods (\u03ba=0.521, p<0.001). Of the 108 patients who were diagnosed with ADL impairment by neurologists, only 56 patients (51.9%) showed impairment according to the Pill Questionnaire. Most of the missed patients had milder cognitive impairment and lower motor disability.\nA comprehensive interview is essential to determine the presence of ADL impairment in PD patients, especially in patients with early PD.",

    "abstract": "A Saskatchewan multi-incident family was clinically characterized with Parkinson disease (PD) and Lewy body pathology. PD segregates as an autosomal-dominant trait, which could not be ascribed to any known mutation. DNA from three affected members was subjected to exome sequencing. Genome alignment, variant annotation and comparative analyses were used to identify shared coding mutations. Sanger sequencing was performed within the extended family and ethnically matched controls. Subsequent genotyping was performed in a multi-ethnic case-control series consisting of 2928 patients and 2676 control subjects from Canada, Norway, Taiwan, Tunisia, and the USA. A novel mutation in receptor-mediated endocytosis 8/RME-8 (DNAJC13 p.Asn855Ser) was found to segregate with disease. Screening of cases and controls identified four additional patients with the mutation, of which two had familial parkinsonism. All carriers shared an ancestral DNAJC13 p.Asn855Ser haplotype and claimed Dutch-German-Russian Mennonite heritage. DNAJC13 regulates the dynamics of clathrin coats on early endosomes. Cellular analysis shows that the mutation confers a toxic gain-of-function and impairs endosomal transport. DNAJC13 immunoreactivity was also noted within Lewy body inclusions. In late-onset disease which is most reminiscent of idiopathic PD subtle deficits in endosomal receptor-sorting/recycling are highlighted by the discovery of pathogenic mutations VPS35, LRRK2 and now DNAJC13. With this latest discovery, and from a neuronal perspective, a temporal and functional ecology is emerging that connects synaptic exo- and endocytosis, vesicular trafficking, endosomal recycling and the endo-lysosomal degradative pathway. Molecular deficits in these processes are genetically linked to the phenotypic spectrum of parkinsonism associated with Lewy body pathology.",

    "abstract": "Changes in sensory function that have been described in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) can be either 'pure' disorders of conscious perception such as elevations in sensory threshold, or disorders of sensorimotor integration, in which the interaction between sensory input and motor output is altered. In this article, we review the extensive evidence for disrupted tactile, nociceptive, thermal and proprioceptive sensations in PD, as well as the influences exerted on these sensations by dopaminergic therapy and deep brain stimulation. We argue that abnormal spatial and temporal processing of sensory information produces incorrect signals for the preparation and execution of voluntary movement. Sensory deficits are likely to be a consequence of the dopaminergic denervation of the basal ganglia that is the hallmark of PD. A possible mechanism to account for somatosensory deficits is one in which disease-related dopaminergic denervation leads to a loss of response specificity, resulting in transmission of noisier and less-differentiated information to cortical regions. Changes in pain perception might have a different explanation, possibly involving disease-related effects outside the basal ganglia, including involvement of peripheral pain receptors, as well as structures such as the periaqueductal grey matter and non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence, presentation, and predictors of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD).\nGuided by the Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms, this retrospective exploratory study used data abstracted from admission clinical records of 271 male patients with idiopathic PD enrolled in a movement disorders clinic at a large metropolitan Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the eastern region of the United States. Data from the admission questionnaire, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and Mini Mental State Examination were abstracted by trained research assistants. Interrater reliability for the abstraction process was 0.99 in a randomly selected 10% sample of records. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the prevalence of LUTS. Logistic regression was used to determine LUTS risk factors and predictors.\nAt least one LUTS was reported by 40.2% of participants. Incontinence was the most prevalent symptom, affecting almost 25% of participants, followed by nocturia (14.8%) and frequency (13.7%). Of the 10 identified risk factors for LUTS, four significant predictors were discovered: number of non-PD medications (p < .05), PD duration (p < .05), number of comorbidities (p < .05), and history of a hernia diagnosis (p < .05).\nAssessment for LUTS should be a component of every evaluation of a patient with PD. Our findings offer a preliminary profile of the male PD patient with LUTS, which is an important step toward effective screening, detection, and access to care and treatment. Next steps in research include further work to identify predictors of LUTS in both male and female PD populations, explore patient perspectives, begin trials of interventions for LUTS in the PD population, and analyze the economic impact.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurological condition, usually occurring among older individuals. Along with increasing handicaps in daily life, patients with PD also face problems with psychosocial adjustment. This study explored the experiences of older Taiwanese individuals at different stages of PD. Qualitative design with in-depth interviews was conducted with participants being treated at the neurology outpatient department in a teaching hospital in northern Taiwan. The study included nine men and six women, aged 65-80 years, with PD at stages 1-4. Comparative analysis of the interviews revealed four themes: ignorance of symptoms, loss of control, gradual deterioration, and a deep sense of helplessness. In stage 1, symptoms were not significant at the onset of PD. For most participants, others first detected the symptoms, rather than themselves. During stage 2, although they could still care for themselves, they became very anxious when the effects of medication disappeared and their reactions slowed before they took the next dose. During stage 3, the physical capacity of the body decreased gradually and affected the patient's participation in social activities. In stage 4, older patients gradually became dependent on others in their daily lives. They were upset and worried that the symptoms would worsen and make them become a burden for their children. By understanding the perceptions of elderly patients at different stages of PD, this study has organized the key care requirements into four stages. These include the following: (1) provide more information on the disease in stage 1, (2) increase guidance on regular medication usage and establish a support system in stage 2, (3) highlight the importance of a safe living environment and encourage participation in support groups in stage 3, and (4) assist patients to find the meaning of life and value of existence in stage 4.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), the response to L-dopa is highly variable and unpredictable. The major pathway for dopamine synthesis from L-dopa is decarboxylation by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD, encoded by the DDC gene).\nTo determine the motor response to L-dopa in PD patients as a function of the DDC gene promoter polymorphisms (rs921451 T > C polymorphism (DDC(T/C)) and rs3837091 AGAG del (DDC(AGAG/-))).\nThirty-three Caucasian PD patients underwent an acute l-dopa challenge together with the peripheral AAAD inhibitor benserazide and were genotyped for rs921451 and rs3837091. The primary efficacy criterion was the motor response to L-dopa, as estimated by the area under the curve for the change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS) score relative to baseline (AUC\u0394UPDRS) in the 4 h following L-dopa administration. Secondary endpoints were pharmacokinetic parameters for plasma levels of L-dopa and dopamine. Investigators and patients were blinded to genotypes data throughout the study.\nWhen adjusted for the L-dopa dose, the AUC\u0394UPDRS was significantly lower in DDC(CC/CT) patients (n = 14) than in DDC(TT) patients (n = 19) and significantly lower in DDC(-/- or AGAG/-) patients (n = 8) than in DDC(AGAG/AGAG) patients (n = 25). There were no significant intergroup differences in plasma pharmacokinetic parameters for L-dopa and dopamine.\nThe rs921451 and rs3837091 polymorphisms of the DDC gene promoter influence the motor response to L-dopa but do not significantly change peripheral pharmacokinetic parameters for L-dopa and dopamine. Our results suggest that DDC may be a genetic modifier of the l-dopa response in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative disease. The etiology and pathogenetic mechanisms that cause PD are still not fully understood. The available treatments to PD are only symptomatic relief. Acupuncture is used to treat many medical conditions for 1000 years in China and has gained wider and increasing acceptance within both public and medical profession because it has been a very safe and well-tolerated treatment. In this chapter, we reviewed relevant laboratory findings regarding acupuncture mechanism on Parkinson's. We showed that acupuncture stimulation in Parkinson's models had generated valuable mechanistic insight of Parkinson's and showed that acupuncture treatment is in fact a neuroprotective therapy that increase the release of various neuroprotective agents such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, and cyclophilin A. In addition, acupuncture therapy slows cell death process and attenuates oxidative stress to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Further, acupuncture therapy modulates neuronal activity of the basal ganglia output structures. These results suggest that early application of acupuncture therapy to Parkinson's patients may be helpful for the best efficacy of acupuncture treatment. It is hopeful that translation of achievement in acupuncture research in Parkinson's models will maximize the potentials of acupuncture treatment.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) has been shown to be an effective treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease. Strong clinical evidence supports the improvement of motor and non-motor complications and quality of life, with some data suggesting that GPi DBS might be less effective than STN DBS. However, neither STN nor GPi stimulation provides a satisfactory control of non-dopaminergic symptoms, such as gait and balance impairment and cognitive decline, which are frequent and disabling symptoms in advanced Parkinson's disease patients. Therefore, several efforts have been made to discover alternative and new targets to overcome these current DBS limitations. Among these new targets, the stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus has initially appeared encouraging. However, findings from different double-blind trials have mitigated the enthusiasm. A multi-target strategy aimed at improving symptoms with different pathogenetic mechanisms might be a promising approach in the next years.",

    "abstract": "Celastrol, a potent natural triterpene and one of the most promising medicinal molecules, is known to possess a broad range of biological activity. Rotenone, a pesticide and complex I inhibitor, is commonly used to produce experimental models of Parkinson's disease both in vivo and in vitro. The present study was designed to examine the effects of celastrol on cell injury induced by rotenone in the human dopaminergic cells and to elucidate the possible mechanistic clues in its neuroprotective action. We demonstrate that celastrol protects SH-SY5Y cells from rotenone-induced cellular injury and apoptotic cell death. Celastrol also prevented the increased generation of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) loss induced by rotenone. Similarly, celastrol treatment inhibited cytochrome c release, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio changes, and caspase-9/3 activation. Celastrol specifically inhibited rotenone-evoked p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in SH-SY5Y cells. These data suggest that celastrol may serve as a potent agent for prevention of neurotoxin-induced neurodegeneration through multiple mechanisms and thus has therapeutic potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Classical activation (M1 phenotype) and alternative activation (M2 phenotype) are the two polars of microglial activation states that can produce either detrimental or beneficial effects in the central nervous system (CNS). Harnessing the beneficial properties of microglia cells by modulating their polarization states provides great potential for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the epigenetic mechanism that regulates microglia polarization remains elusive. Here, we reported that histone H3K27me3 demethylase Jumonji domain containing 3 (Jmjd3) was essential for M2 microglia polarization. Suppression of Jmjd3 in N9 microglia inhibited M2 polarization and simultaneously exaggerated M1 microglial inflammatory responses, which led to extensive neuron death in vitro. We also observed that the suppression of Jmjd3 in the substantia nigra (SN) in vivo dramatically caused microglial overactivation and exacerbated dopamine (DA) neuron death in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated mouse model of PD. Moreover, we showed that the Jmjd3 level was lower in the midbrain of aged mice, which was accompanied by an elevated level of H3K27me3 and an increased ratio of M1 to M2 markers, suggesting that aging is an important factor in switching the microglia phenotypes. Overall, our studies indicate that Jmjd3 is able to enhance the polarization of M2 microglia by modifying histone H3K27me3, and therefore it has a pivotal role in the switch of microglia phenotypes that may contribute to the immune pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "The effects of Parkinson's disease (PD) on action selection in conflictual situations were examined in an experiment using the flanker task in combination with event-related brain potentials (ERPs). More specifically, we investigated the effects of PD on behavioral and neuronal indicators of both instantaneous (within-trial flanker congruency effects) and sequence-dependent (between-trial congruency sequence effects) distractor interference. Consistent with the existing literature, congruency-sensitive ERP components (i.e., fronto-central N2 and positive 'dips' of the lateralized readiness potential, LRP) were observed over medial-frontal and lateral-central regions, respectively. For situations requiring instantaneous action control, patients with PD and healthy controls showed similar congruency effects on reaction time, as well as on N2 and LRP 'dip' amplitudes. As expected, controls showed reliable congruency sequence effects on reaction time, as well as on N2 and LRP 'dip' amplitudes. However, patients with PD were completely unaffected by the congruence sequence across consecutive trials, as revealed by reaction time, as well as by N2 and LRP 'dip' amplitudes. The data imply that the effects of PD on action selection are largely restricted to a lack of adaptive modulation in time which we refer to as neurocognitive inflexibility, in the context of relatively spared abilities to instantaneously exert control over action selection. The findings are discussed in terms of basal ganglia dysfunction induced by PD which results primarily either in executive function deficits or in aberrant habit formation.",

    "abstract": "The human dopamine transporter gene (gene symbol: SLC6A3) is considered as a candidate risk factor for Parkinson's disease because dopamine transporter accumulates cytotoxic dopamine or other toxins in the dopamine neurons. However, findings from numerous association studies in different populations have been inconsistent with each other. In this study, we performed a combined analysis of published case-control genetic association data between SLC6A3 and Parkinson's disease. The results indicate that SLC6A3 confers a modest but significant risk for Parkinson's disease in various populations. Allele 10-repeat of the 40-base pair variable number tandem repeat, a well studied polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of SLC6A3, confers neuroprotection in East Asian (OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.94 and p=0.009) but not in Caucasian populations. Genotype GG and allele G of the promoter single nucleotide polymorphism rs2652510 is associated with a risk in Caucasians (allelic G, OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04-1.54, and p=0.018; genotypic GG OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.03-1.84 and p=0.032). Such information implies a population-dependent involvement of SLC6A3 in the etiology of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "LRRK2 is one of the most important genetic contributors to Parkinson's disease (PD). Point mutations in this gene cause an autosomal dominant form of PD, but to date no cellular phenotype has been consistently linked with mutations in each of the functional domains (ROC, COR and Kinase) of the protein product of this gene. In this study, primary fibroblasts from individuals carrying pathogenic mutations in the three central domains of LRRK2 were assessed for alterations in the autophagy/lysosomal pathway using a combination of biochemical and cellular approaches. Mutations in all three domains resulted in alterations in markers for autophagy/lysosomal function compared to wild type cells. These data highlight the autophagy and lysosomal pathways as read outs for pathogenic LRRK2 function and as a marker for disease, and provide insight into the mechanisms linking LRRK2 function and mutations.",

    "abstract": "CYP2D6 polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) susceptibility, but the results of these previous studies were inconsistent.\nTo explore whether PD patients with CYP2D6 gene variation have different risk to PD to those with normal function of CYP2D6.\nSystematic review with meta-analysis of case-controlled studies on the association between CYP2D6 and PD risk was conducted. Studies published up to August 1, 2013 were identified by searching electronic databases PubMed and Embase. Odds ratios (ORs) together with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimated the association between CYP2D6 polymorphisms and PD risk in different phenotype models. Meta-regression, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and publication bias were also performed.\nA total of 3521 PD Patients and 4476 controls from 29 case-control studies were identified. Overall, a borderline significant influence of the CYP2D6 polymorphisms on PD risk was observed (OR: 1.07, 95%CI: 0.99-1.16, p=0.106). Significant association was found when comparisons were performed in different phenotypes in PM versus EM (OR=1.33, 95% CI=1.01-1.74, p=0.044) and PM versus IM+EM (OR=1.32, 95% CI=1.11-1.56, p=0.002). In subgroup analysis stratified by country, significant association was demonstrated in British but not in other white subjects. No significant association was detected in subgroup analysis according to the age of onset and the source of patients.\nThe present meta-analysis demonstrated that the poor metabolizer phenotype of CYP2D6 confers a significant genetic susceptibility to PD in Caucasians, especially in British white subjects.",

    "abstract": "Motor imagery during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows assessment of brain activity during tasks, like walking, that cannot be completed in an MRI scanner. We used gait imagery to assess the neural pathophysiology of locomotion in Parkinson disease (PD).\nBrain activity was measured in five locomotor regions (supplementary motor area (SMA), globus pallidus (GP), putamen, mesencephalic locomotor region, cerebellar locomotor region) during simple (forward) and complex (backward, turning) gait imagery. Brain activity was correlated to overground walking velocity.\nAcross tasks, PD exhibited reduced activity in the globus pallidus compared to controls. People with PD, but not controls, exhibited more activity in the SMA during imagined turning compared to forward or backward walking. In PD, walking speed was correlated to brain activity in several regions.\nAltered SMA activity in PD during imagined turning may represent compensatory neural adaptations during complex gait. The lowered activity and positive correlation to locomotor function in GP suggests reduced activity in this region may relate to locomotor dysfunction.\nThis study elucidates changes in neural activity during gait in PD, underscoring the importance of testing simple and complex tasks. Results support a positive relationship between activity in locomotor regions and walking ability.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of the most promising neuromodulatory techniques to gain momentum over the last 20years, with significant evidence showing the benefit of DBS for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, many questions still exist pertaining to the optimal placement of stimulation contacts. This paper aims to review the latest and most relevant studies evaluating subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus interna (GPi) stimulation. Additionally, it aims to shine a light on several of the lesser-known targets with mounting evidence of efficacy. Referenced literature for the main body of the article was gathered from Medline and PubMed databases. Results were limited to \"full text\", \"English language\" and publications from 1999 onwards. Case reports were excluded. The current evidence irrefutably demonstrates the benefits of both STN and GPi DBS on Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III motor scores, with very similar outcomes seen after 1-2years. Currently, it appears the greatest differences lie in the associated adverse effects. STN DBS was associated with a greater reduction in dopamine replacement therapy, but also appeared to have more negative effects on speech and mood. Meanwhile, in regards to alternative targets, the pedunculopontine nucleus has shown promising improvement in axial symptoms, while the ventral intermediate nucleus has demonstrated significant efficacy at suppressing tremor, and the caudal zona incerta may be superior to the STN and GPi in improving UPDRS-III scores. Due to the complexity of Parkinson's disease, an individual disease profile must be determined in a patient-by-patient fashion such that appropriate targets can be selected accordingly.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Increasing evidence shows that physical exercise is beneficial for motor and non-motor symptoms of PD, and animal models suggest that it may help slow progression of disease.\nUsing a randomized delayed-start design, 31 patients were randomized to an early start group (ESG) or a delayed start group (DSG) exercise program. The ESG underwent a rigorous formal group exercise program for 1 h, three days/week, for 48 weeks (November 2011-October 2012). The DSG participated in this identical exercise program from weeks 24-48. Outcome measures included the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Walking Test (get-up-and-go), Tinetti Mobility Test, PDQ-39 Questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory.\nThere was minimal attrition in this study, with only one patient dropping out. Results did not show improvement in total UPDRS scores with early exercise. At week 48, the mean change from baseline total UPDRS score was 6.33 in the ESG versus 5.13 in the DSG (p = 0.58). However, patients randomized to the ESG scored significantly better on the Beck Depression Inventory, with a mean improvement of 1.07 points relative to those in the DSG (p = 0.04).\nThe findings demonstrate that long-term, group exercise programs are feasible in the Parkinson's disease population, with excellent adherence and minimal drop out. While the outcome measures used in our study did not provide strong evidence that exercise has a neuroprotective effect on motor function, earlier participation in a group exercise program had a significant effect on symptoms of depression.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, and missense mutations in the LRRK2 gene are the most common single genetic cause of autosomal dominant PD and polymorphic variants modulate risk in sporadic PD. Earlier research focused on LRRK2 genetics, but with the recent discoveries of LRRK2 substrates/interactors, LRRK2-specific mechanisms are being unveiled.\nAs a multi-domain protein, LRRK2 possess diverse functions that range from housekeeping, signaling to clearance of proteins. Proteins that interact with LRRK2 have drawn attention to several pathophysiologic pathways that could potentially be targeted in the development of new therapies. This review will discuss the possible physiological roles of LRRK2 based on recently reported interactors as well as place LRRK2 in the disease context. Current LRRK2 inhibition studies and reports about LRRK2 biomarkers will also be discussed as they are important considerations for LRRK2 translational treatment options.\nThe discovery of LRRK2 as a pathogenic gene in PD has contributed enormously to our understanding of clinical genetics. One of the challenges is to understand the physiologic role of LRRK2 and its specific function that gets disrupted when it is mutated. In vivo LRRK2 models have provided insights but they do not full recapitulate human PD. The identification of LRRK2 interactors opens the opportunities for identification of new therapeutic targets. Ways of quantification of kinase activity in vivo and determining what constitutes physiologic inhibition will need to be further investigated before specific pharmacologic agents can be meaningfully utilized.",

    "abstract": "Rotenone a widely used pesticide that inhibits mitochondrial complex I has been used to investigate the pathobiology of PD both in vitro and in vivo. Studies have shown that the neurotoxicity of rotenone may be related to its ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to neuronal apoptosis. The current study was carried out to investigate the neuroprotective effects of hesperidin, a citrus fruit flavanol, against rotenone-induced apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. We assessed cell death, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS generation, ATP levels, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, and the activity of catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) using well established assays. Apoptosis was determined in normal, rotenone, and hesperidin treated cells, by measuring the protein expression of cytochrome c (cyt c), caspases 3 and 9, Bax, and Bcl-2 using the standard western blotting technique. The apoptosis in rotenone-induced SK-N-SH cells was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ROS generation, the depletion of GSH, enhanced activities of enzymatic antioxidants, upregulation of Bax, cyt c, and caspases 3 and 9, and downregulation of Bcl-2, which were attenuated in the presence of hesperidin. Our data suggests that hesperidin exerts its neuroprotective effect against rotenone due to its antioxidant, maintenance of mitochondrial function, and antiapoptotic properties in a neuroblastoma cell line.",

    "abstract": "Protocatechuic aldehyde (PAL) has been reported to bind to DJ-1, a key protein involved in Parkinson's disease (PD), and exerts potential neuroprotective effects via DJ-1 in SH-SY5Y cells. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective pharmacological effects of PAL against neurotoxin-induced cell and animal models of PD. In cellular models of PD, PAL markedly increased cell viability rates, mitochondrial oxidation-reduction activity and mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced intracellular ROS levels to prevent neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. In animal models of PD, PAL reduced the apomorphine injection, caused turning in 6-OHDA treated rats, and increased the motor coordination and stride decreases in MPTP treated mice. Meanwhile, in an MPTP mouse model, PAL prevented a decrease of the contents of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites in the striatum and TH-positive dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra (SN). In addition, PAL increased the protein expression of DJ-1 and reduced the level of \u03b1-synuclein in the SN of MPTP lesioned mice. PAL also increased the spine density in hippocampal CA1 neurons. The current study demonstrates that PAL can efficiently protect dopaminergic neurons against neurotoxin injury in vitro and in vivo, and that the potential mechanisms may be related to its effects in increasing DJ-1, decreasing \u03b1-synuclein and its growth-promoting effect on spine density.",

    "abstract": "Synucleinopathies are a broad class of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the presence of intracellular protein aggregates containing \u03b1-synuclein protein. The aggregated \u03b1-synuclein protein is hyperphosphorylated on serine 129 (S129) compared to the unaggregated form of the protein. While the precise functional consequences of S129 hyperphosphorylation are still being clarified, numerous in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that S129 phosphorylation is an early event in \u03b1-synuclein dysfunction and aggregation. Identifying the kinases and phosphatases that regulate this critical phosphorylation event may ultimately prove beneficial by allowing pharmacological mitigation of synuclein dysfunction and toxicity in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. We report here the development of a high-content, fluorescence-based assay to quantitate levels of total and S129 phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein protein. We have applied this assay to conduct high-throughput loss-of-function screens with siRNA libraries targeting 711 known and predicted human kinases and 206 phosphatases. Specifically, knockdown of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase related kinase SMG1 resulted in significant increases in the expression of pS129 phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein (p-syn). Moreover, SMG1 protein levels were significantly reduced in brain regions with high p-syn levels in both dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). These findings suggest that SMG1 may play an important role in increased \u03b1-synuclein pathology during the course of PDD, DLB, and possibly other synucleinopathies.",

    "abstract": "Various genetic or toxin-induced mouse models are frequently used for investigation of early PD pathology. Although olfactory impairment is known to precede motor symptoms by years, it is not known whether it is caused by impairments in the brain, the olfactory epithelium, or both. In this study, we investigated the olfactory function in three genetic Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse models and mice treated with MPTP intraperitoneally and intranasally. To investigate olfactory function, we performed electro-olfactogram recordings (EOGs) and an olfactory behavior test (cookie-finding test). We show that neither a parkin knockout mouse strain, nor intraperitoneal MPTP treated animals display any olfactory impairment in EOG recordings and the applied behavior test. We also found no difference in the responses of the olfactory epithelium to odorants in a mouse strain over-expressing doubly mutated \u03b1-synuclein, while this mouse strain was not suitable to test olfaction in a cookie-finding test as it displays a mobility impairment. A transgenic mouse expressing mutated \u03b1-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons performed equal to control animals in the cookie-finding test. Further we show that intranasal MPTP application can cause functional damage of the olfactory epithelium.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra leading to dysfunctional cortico-striato-thalamic-cortical loops. In addition to the characteristic motor symptoms, PD patients often show cognitive impairments, affective changes and other non-motor symptoms, suggesting system-wide effects on brain function. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and graph-theory based analysis methods to investigate altered whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity in PD patients (n = 37) compared to healthy controls (n = 20). Global network properties indicated less efficient processing in PD. Analysis of brain network modules pointed to increased connectivity within the sensorimotor network, but decreased interaction of the visual network with other brain modules. We found lower connectivity mainly between the cuneus and the ventral caudate, medial orbitofrontal cortex and the temporal lobe. To identify regions of altered connectivity, we mapped the degree of intrinsic functional connectivity both on ROI- and on voxel-level across the brain. Compared to healthy controls, PD patients showed lower connectedness in the medial and middle orbitofrontal cortex. The degree of connectivity was also decreased in the occipital lobe (cuneus and calcarine), but increased in the superior parietal cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, supramarginal gyrus and supplementary motor area. Our results on global network and module properties indicated that PD manifests as a disconnection syndrome. This was most apparent in the visual network module. The higher connectedness within the sensorimotor module in PD patients may be related to compensation mechanism in order to overcome the functional deficit of the striato-cortical motor loops or to loss of mutual inhibition between brain networks. Abnormal connectivity in the visual network may be related to adaptation and compensation processes as a consequence of altered motor function. Our analysis approach proved sensitive for detecting disease-related localized effects as well as changes in network functions on intermediate and global scale.",

    "abstract": "To date, statistical methods that take into account fully the non-linear, longitudinal and multivariate aspects of clinical data have not been applied to the study of progression in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of such methodology for studying the temporal and spatial aspects of the progression of PD. Extending this methodology further, we also explore the presymptomatic course of this disease.\nLongitudinal Positron Emission Tomography (PET) measurements were collected on 78 PD patients, from 4 subregions on each side of the brain, using 3 different radiotracers. Non-linear, multivariate, longitudinal random effects modelling was applied to analyze and interpret these data.\nThe data showed a non-linear decline in PET measurements, which we modelled successfully by an exponential function depending on two patient-related covariates duration since symptom onset and age at symptom onset. We found that the degree of damage was significantly greater in the posterior putamen than in the anterior putamen throughout the disease. We also found that over the course of the illness, the difference between the less affected and more affected sides of the brain decreased in the anterior putamen. Younger patients had significantly poorer measurements than older patients at the time of symptom onset suggesting more effective compensatory mechanisms delaying the onset of symptoms. Cautious extrapolation showed that disease onset had occurred some 8 to 17 years prior to symptom onset.\nOur model provides important biological insights into the pathogenesis of PD, as well as its preclinical aspects. Our methodology can be applied widely to study many other chronic progressive diseases.",

    "abstract": "Ampelopsis Radix, the root of Ampelopsis japonica (Thunb.) Makino (Vitaceae), is a herbal medicine which has been widely used in East Asia. The present study was done to explore whether the standardized extract of Ampelopsis Radix (AJW) protects dopaminergic neurons via antioxidant mechanisms in Parkinson's disease (PD) models. The effects of AJW on primary mesencephalic cultures stressed with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium were investigated using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry and reactive oxygen species measurement. The eliminative effects of AJW on the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radicals were explored using colorimetric methods. The effects of AJW on the mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) were determined by pole test as well as TH and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine immunohistochemistry. AJW protected dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting reactive oxygen species generation in vitro. Moreover, AJW showed potent radical scavenging activities in vitro. In the mouse PD model, AJW protected the dopaminergic neurons in the brain, leading to motor improvements. AJW inhibited the MPTP-evoked accumulation of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine in the brain. These data suggest that AJW has neuroprotective effects with antioxidant mechanisms in PD models.",

We have also focused on their involvement in neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, discussing the contribution of this type of glial cell toward mechanisms that can lead to neuronal death, which was previously attributed exclusively to neurons. Furthermore, we also highlight the latest progress with stem cell technology for the generation of astrocytes from embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. We allude to the need for developing new models that better recapitulate astrocyte heterogeneity and their diverse function within the brain. Those models will greatly contribute in understanding astrocytes' contribution toward molecular mechanisms occurring in neurodegenerative pathologies affecting specific brain regions such as in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.",

Participants were assessed with a structured psychiatric interview and specific scales rating the severity of anxiety, depression, cognition and parkinsonism. The main outcome measure was classes of patients with a specific syndromal profile of anxiety symptoms based on LCA.\nLCA identified four classes that were interpreted as \"no anxiety or depression\", \"episodic anxiety without depression\", \"persistent anxiety with depression\", and \"both persistent and episodic anxiety with depression\". Symptoms of persistent anxiety were almost invariably associated with symptoms of depression. There were significant differences between classes in terms of history of depression and anxiety, use of psychoactive medication, and on the Mentation and Complications sections of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale.\nPatients with PD show different syndromic profiles of anxiety that do not align with the symptom profiles represented by DSM-IV anxiety disorders and major depression. Accordingly, DSM-IV criteria for anxiety disorders may not be clinically useful in PD. The different classes identified here provide empirically validated phenotypes for future research.",

    "abstract": "Converging evidence suggests dysregulation of epigenetics in terms of histone-mediated acetylation/deacetylation imbalance in Parkinson's disease (PD). Targeting histone deacetylase (HDAC) in neuronal survival and neuroprotection may be beneficial in the treatment and prevention of neurodegenerative disorders. Few pharmacological studies use the transgenic model of PD to characterize the neuroprotection actions of a lead compound known to target HDAC in the brain.\nIn our study, we investigated neuroprotective effects of liposomal-formulated curcumin: Lipocurc\u2122 targeting HDAC inhibitor in the DJ-1(Park 7)-gene knockout rat model of PD. Group I (DJ-1-KO-Lipocurc\u2122) received Lipocurc\u2122 20 mg/kg iv 3\u00d7 weekly for 8 weeks; Group II: DJ-1 KO controls (DJ-1 KO-PBS) received i.v. phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Group III: DJ-1-Wild Type (DJ-1 WT-PBS) received PBS. We monitored various components of motor behavior, rotarod, dyskinesia, and open-field behaviors, both at baseline and at regular intervals. Toward the end of the 8 weeks, we measured neuronal apoptosis and dopamine (DA) neuron-specific tyrosine hydroxylase levels by immunohistochemistry methods at post-mortem.\nWe found that DJ-KO Group I and Group II, as compared with DJ-1 WT group, exhibited moderate degree of motor impairment on the rotarod test. Lipocurc\u2122 treatment improved the motor behavior motor impairment to a greater extent than the PBS treatment. There was marked apoptosis in the DJ-1 WT group. Lipocurc\u2122 significantly blocked neuronal apoptosis: the apoptotic index of DJ-1-KO-Lipocurc\u2122 group was markedly reduced compared with the DJ-KO-PBS group (3.3 vs 25.0, p<0.001). We found preliminary evidence Lipocurc\u2122 stimulated DA neurons in the substantia nigra. The ratio of immature to mature DA neurons in substantia nigra was statistically higher in the DJ-1-KO-Lipocurc\u2122 group (p<0.025).\nWe demonstrated for the first time Lipocurc\u2122's anti-apoptotic and neurotrophic effects in theDJ-1-KO rat model of PD. Our promising findings warrant randomized controlled trial of Lipocurc\u2122 in translating the novel nanotechnology-based epigenetics-driven drug discovery platform toward efficacious therapeutics in PD.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have deficits in perceptual timing, or the perception and estimation of time. PD patients can also have cognitive symptoms, including deficits in executive functions such as working memory, planning, and visuospatial attention. Here, we discuss how PD-related cognitive symptoms contribute to timing deficits. Timing is influenced by signaling of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the striatum. Timing also involves the frontal cortex, which is dysfunctional in PD. Frontal cortex impairments in PD may influence memory subsystems as well as decision processes during timing tasks. These data suggest that timing may be a type of executive function. As such, timing can be used to study the neural circuitry of cognitive symptoms of PD as they can be studied in animal models. Performance of timing tasks also maybe a useful clinical biomarker of frontal as well as striatal dysfunction in PD.",
