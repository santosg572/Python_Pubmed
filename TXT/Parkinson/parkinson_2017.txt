    "abstract": "Movement disorders including Parkinson\u2019s disease and dystonia are caused by neurological dysfunction, typically resulting from the loss of a neuronal input within a circuit. Neuromodulation, specifically deep brain stimulation (DBS), has proven to be a critical development in the treatment of movement disorders. Continuing efforts aim to improve DBS techniques, both in how they exert their effects and in the efficacy of the mechanism involved in eliciting those effects. While optogenetic stimulation is currently infeasible in human patients, opto-DBS research provides an indispensible avenue to understand the mechanisms of DBS therapeutic and adverse effects. We review the benefits of cell-type specific manipulations in understanding the root cause of movement disorders and how DBS might optimally combat those causes. We also explore new circuit-inspired applications of DBS suggested by thorough, high-throughput optogenetic techniques. Maximizing the efficacy and outcome of DBS requires a multi-tiered approach; research employing optogenetics provides the specificity and feasibility to uncover the mechanisms that will help realize these gains in patient care.",

However, current adaptive DBS techniques are primarily based on single-feature thresholding, precluding an optimized delivery of stimulation for precise control of motor symptoms. Here, we propose to use a machine learning approach for resting-state tremor detection from local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from subthalamic nucleus (STN) in 12 Parkinson's patients. We compare the performance of state-of-the-art classifiers and LFP-based biomarkers for tremor detection, showing that the high-frequency oscillations and Hjorth parameters achieve a high discriminative performance. In addition, using Kalman filtering in the feature space, we show that the tremor detection performance significantly improves (F",

    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms that use data streams captured from soft wearable sensors have the potential to automatically detect PD symptoms and inform clinicians about the progression of disease. However, these algorithms must be trained with annotated data from clinical experts who can recognize symptoms, and collecting such data are costly. Understanding how many sensors and how much labeled data are required is key to successfully deploying these models outside of the clinic. Here we recorded movement data using 6 flexible wearable sensors in 20 individuals with PD over the course of multiple clinical assessments conducted on 1 day and repeated 2 weeks later. Participants performed 13 common tasks, such as walking or typing, and a clinician rated the severity of symptoms (bradykinesia and tremor). We then trained convolutional neural networks and statistical ensembles to detect whether a segment of movement showed signs of bradykinesia or tremor based on data from tasks performed by other individuals. Our results show that a single wearable sensor on the back of the hand is sufficient for detecting bradykinesia and tremor in the upper extremities, whereas using sensors on both sides does not improve performance. Increasing the amount of training data by adding other individuals can lead to improved performance, but repeating assessments with the same individuals-even at different medication states-does not substantially improve detection across days. Our results suggest that PD symptoms can be detected during a variety of activities and are best modeled by a dataset incorporating many individuals.",

    "abstract": "The rule of one terminal and one transmitter acting on one synapse clearly fails to cover the complexity of chemical synapse operation in the brain. Compelling evidence now indicates that two transmitters can be released from the same terminal, acting in a complementary manner to generate complex electrical activity in the targets. Our laboratory now showed that a subpopulation striatal cholinergic neurons also release the classical inhibitory transmitter GABA with a balance between excitation and inhibition being provided by acetylcholine and GABA, respectively. An illustration of the importance of this dual release comes from the fact that when dopamine signals are absent such as in Parkinson disease (PD) the GABAergic inhibition in these dual cholinergic/GABAergic cells fails because of high intracellular chloride ((Cl",

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) agonists have received much attention in research because of their neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects that reduce cell death and halt the progression of neurodegeneration. Thus, this study observed the pioglitazone effects on the main inflammatory markers after 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion.\nThe effects of a 5-day administration of the PPAR-\u03b3 agonist pioglitazone (30\u2009mg/kg) in male Wistar rats that received bilateral intranigral infusions of 6-OHDA. After surgery, the rats were evaluated in the open-field test on days 1,7,14, and 21. Immediately after the behavioral tests on day 21, the rats were euthanized, and the substantia nigra was removed to analyze the expression of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and I\u03baB by western blot. To immunohistochemical, animals were intracardially perfused, with brain removal that was frozen and sectioned, being selected slices of the SNc region to detect tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity, microglia activation (Iba-1) and NF-\u03baB translocation in the nucleus.\nPioglitazone protected rats against hypolocomotion and 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration on day 7. Decreases in the microglial activation and the NF-\u03baB expression were observed, and the p65 activation was inhibited.\nThese results suggest that pioglitazone may be a potential adjuvant for the treatment of Parkinson`s disease because of its effects on pathological markers of the progression of neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is associated with multiple nonmotor symptoms including gastrointestinal (GI) distress, which affect patients' activities of daily living and are traditionally treated by pharmaceutical agents aimed at symptom control. In this case, a 73-y-old female presented with 3 wk of constipation and acid reflux after a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and initiation of carbidopa-levodopa 6 mo prior. A contributing factor was anosmia leading to a vast dietary change. All other etiologies were excluded via clinical history and physical exam. Dietary intervention was initiated as the foundational treatment and included increased consumption of vegetables to 5 servings per day, increased dietary fiber to 30 g per day, increased protein consumption, decreased sugar consumption, and increased hydration. These dietary changes were accompanied by symptomatic relief of acid reflux through apple cider vinegar and deglycyrrhizinated licorice as well as probiotic and magnesium citrate initiation for constipation. The patient had complete resolution of constipation and 50% improvement in acid reflux after 5 d and complete resolution of all symptoms after 1 mo. GI complications associated with neurologic disorders such as Parkinson's disease may be managed via foundational dietary changes with natural symptom control with similar outcomes as pharmaceutical management but without lasting side effects.",

The present study aimed to determine the effect of weekly ballet classes on gait variability and balance confidence for people with Parkinson's.\nThe study follows a non-randomised, controlled project evaluation design. A group of 19 people with Parkinson's who were already involved in weekly ballet classes volunteered for this research. A control group of 13 people with Parkinson's were asked to not participate in dance classes across the duration of the study.\nThe study did not demonstrate significant effects of weekly ballet classes on gait variability or balance confidence.\nThese findings differ from recent studies that suggest dancing can improve balance and gait for this population. There is a need to examine the optimal ballet class frequency required to elicit any potential positive change.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity is critical in Parkinson disease (PD) management, but barriers and motivators of activity in Veterans with PD may be unique. We examined activity habits, including barriers and motivators, in this population.\nParticipants completed the Physical Activity Scale in the Elderly (PASE). Compliance with American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations was assessed. Veterans also completed the Exercise Perceptions Questionnaire (EPQ), assessing knowledge, barriers, and motivators of activity. Free-text barriers/motivators were analyzed by the overlapping clusters method.\nSeventy-five Veterans were recruited; mean age (standard deviation [SD]) was 70.5 (8.2) years and mean disease duration (SD) was 5.4 (5.2) years. Raw median PASE was 120.4 (interquartile range [IQR] 68.8-165.7); age-adjusted median PASE was 135.3. Only 9 Veterans (14.3%) were AHA-compliant. There were trends toward negative association between PASE and UPDRS-3 (r\u202f=\u202f-0.24, p\u202f=\u202f0.06) and between PASE and PDQ-8 (r\u202f=\u202f-0.23, p\u202f=\u202f0.08). Sixty-three subjects (84%) completed the EPQ; 27 (42.9%) preferred scheduled exercise, and only 33 (53.2%) reported that they preferred to exercise with others. Common themes of 46 free-text responses included desire to improve PD symptoms (n\u202f=\u202f15, 32.6%) and social engagement (n\u202f=\u202f12, 26.1%).\nSelf-reported activity in Veterans with PD is low, with less than 15% of subjects meeting recommended activity targets. Qualitative analysis of barriers and motivators revealed that although many Veterans enjoy the social aspects of group exercise, they may not feel comfortable in general exercise classes aimed at younger participants without chronic illnesses. These data will be useful in designing Veteran- and/or PD-specific interventions to increase activity levels.",

Raw median PASE was 120.4 (interquartile range [IQR] 68.8-165.7); age-adjusted median PASE was 135.3. Only 9 Veterans (14.3%) were AHA-compliant. There were trends toward negative association between PASE and UPDRS-3 (r\u202f=\u202f-0.24, p\u202f=\u202f0.06) and between PASE and PDQ-8 (r\u202f=\u202f-0.23, p\u202f=\u202f0.08). Sixty-three subjects (84%) completed the EPQ; 27 (42.9%) preferred scheduled exercise, and only 33 (53.2%) reported that they preferred to exercise with others. Common themes of 46 free-text responses included desire to improve PD symptoms (n\u202f=\u202f15, 32.6%) and social engagement (n\u202f=\u202f12, 26.1%).",

    "abstract": "A 13-year-old boy presenting with palpitations was diagnosed with Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome. We elected to bring him to the electrophysiology lab for evaluation of the accessory pathway and potential ablation. Structural assessment of the coronary sinus with electro-anatomical mapping and retrograde venography led to the discovery of a great cardiac vein having a separate insertion from the coronary sinus into the high right atrium. The accessory pathway was localized to the left lateral portion of the mitral annulus and treated successfully with radiofrequency ablation. Such venous anatomical variant has been seldom reported, and its association with an accessory pathway is described here for the first time. Its recognition can have important implications when performing procedures that require access into the coronary venous system.",

    "abstract": "\u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-syn) is a presynaptic protein that regulates the release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles in the brain. \u03b1-Syn aggregates, including Lewy bodies, are features of both sporadic and familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). These aggregates undergo several key stages of fibrillation, oligomerization, and aggregation. Therapeutic benefits of drugs decline with disease progression and offer only symptomatic treatment. Novel therapeutic strategies are required which can either prevent or delay the progression of the disease. The link between \u03b1-syn and the etiopathogenesis and progression of PD are well-established in the literature. Studies indicate that \u03b1-syn is an important therapeutic target and inhibition of \u03b1-syn aggregation, oligomerization, and fibrillation are an important disease modification strategy. However, recent studies have shown that plant extracts and phytochemicals have neuroprotective effects on \u03b1-syn oligomerization and fibrillation by targeting different key stages of its formation. Although many reviews on the antioxidant-mediated, neuroprotective effect of plant extracts and phytochemicals on PD symptoms have been well-highlighted, the antioxidant mechanisms show limited success for translation to clinical studies. The identification of specific plant extracts and phytochemicals that target \u03b1-syn aggregation will provide selective molecules to develop new drugs for PD. The present review provides an overview of plant extracts and phytochemicals that target \u03b1-syn in PD and summarizes the observed effects and the underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we provide a synopsis of current experimental models and techniques used to evaluate plant extracts and phytochemicals. Plant extracts and phytochemicals were found to inhibit the aggregation or fibril formation of oligomers. These also appear to direct \u03b1-syn oligomer formation into its unstructured form or promote non-toxic pathways and suggested to be valuable drug candidates for PD and related synucleinopathy.

    "abstract": "The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) vary among patients and have been categorized into 3 subtypes: tremor dominant, akinetic rigidity, and postural instability and gait disturbance (PIGD). Cerebral microbleed (CMB) is prevalent in people with PD and is associated with some nonmotor symptoms. The present study investigated the association between CMB and the motor subtypes of PD.\nFrom 2009 to 2017, medical records and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports of 134 Taiwanese people with early- and mid-stage PD were reviewed. CMBs were quantified according to the Microbleed Anatomical Rating Scale through susceptibility-weighted MRI. Motor subtypes were determined by medical chart review. Student's t test and multivariable logistic regression were used to analyze the association between the motor subtypes and CMB. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 19.0.\nOverall, 72 (53.7%) participants were women with a mean age of 69.5 \u00b1 9.8 years. The prevalence of CMB was 33.6%, and lobar, deep, and infratentorial CMBs comprised 21.6, 19.4, and 11.9% of cases, respectively. PIGD subtype PD was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of any CMB as well as deep or lobar CMB. After adjustment for age and sex, the PIGD subtype was significantly positively associated with the presence of any, deep, and white matter (WM) and thalamic CMB.\nCMB was prevalent in Taiwanese people with early- and mid-stage PD, especially the PIGD subtype. Deep, especially thalamic and WM, CMBs exhibited the highest association with the PIGD subtype.",

    "abstract": "Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine (APO) treatment is one of the 3 therapeutic options for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), in addition to deep brain stimulation (DBS) and intrajejunal levodopa. Data from previously performed studies show that few PD patients can achieve APO infusion as monotherapy. The current pilot study presents the authors' experience in achieving APO monotherapy.\nDuring the last 2 years, 9 patients with APO were treated in the Department of Neurology of the Medical University of Lublin; each patient was offered a 5-day duration APO treatment as monotherapy. The main indication for the APO therapy was advanced PD with motor fluctuations and the patient's non-agreement for DBS therapy. Mean age of treated patients - 65.11 years, mean disease duration - 7.67 years, mean Hoehn-Yahr - 2.67, mean L-dopa equivalent before APO treatment - 1751.11 mg, mean daily dose of apomorphine as monotherapy - 106.11 \u00b1 14.09 mg.\nAll treated patients managed to achieve APO monotherapy. A statistically significant reduction was found in the duration of the 'off' states in the observed PD patients on APO monotherapy (p<0.05). No significant improvement was observed in the III motor score of the UPDRS on APO treatment, compared to optimized oral therapy used before APO treatment.\nAPO monotherapy can be achieved in advanced PD, and seems to be a good therapeutic option for this group of patients, especially in that it allows a significant reduction in the off-time which significantly simplifies the drug regime. Nevertheless, hospital admission with experienced neurologist supervision is recommended when establishing a PD patient's APO monotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive and gait disturbance are common symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the relationship between cognitive impairment and gait dysfunction in PD has been suggested, specific gait patterns according to cognition are not fully demonstrated yet. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate gait patterns in PD patients with or without cognitive impairment.\nWe studied 86 patients at an average of 4.8 years after diagnosis of PD. Cognitive impairment was defined as scoring 1.5 standard deviation below age- and education-specific means on the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE). Three-dimensional gait analysis was conducted for all patients and quantified gait parameters of temporal-spatial data were used. Relationships among cognition, demographic characteristics, clinical features, and gait pattern were evaluated.\nCognitive impairment was observed in 41 (47.7%) patients. Compared to patients without cognitive impairment, patients with cognitive impairment displayed reduced gait speed, step length, and stride length. Among K-MMSE subcategories, \"registration,\" \"attention/calculation,\" and \"visuospatial function\" were significantly associated with speed, step length, and stride length. However, age, disease duration, Hoehn-Yahr (HY) stage, or Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score was not significantly related to any gait analysis parameter.\nOur present study shows that cognitive impairment is associated with slow and short-stepped gait regardless of HY stage or UPDRS motor score, suggesting that cognitive impairment may serve as a surrogate marker of gait disturbance or fall in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized with the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in a mid-brain. This loss is believed to be associated with number of environmental and genetic factors. Oxidative stress is found to be one of the factors responsible for the initiation and progression of PD. However, studies are still continued to confirm the connection and mechanism associated with oxidative stress and PD. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the association between oxidative stress markers and PD, and explore factors that may elucidate the contradictions in these results. As per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline systematic literature search was carried out. Meta-analysis was carried out on pooled standardized mean differences with 95% confidence interval (CI) of patients with PD and controls using random effect model in comprehensive meta-analysis statistical software. Total 17 studies were included into which 25 oxidative stress markers were analyzed. The results revealed that oxidative stress markers [nitrate and nitric oxide (NO)] and antioxidant markers [total antioxidant status (TAS) and thiols] were not statistically different between the PD and control group (P > 0.05). In case of oxidative stress markers, levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), and lipid hydro-peroxide (LPO) were found to be high in patients with PD as compared to controls with P < 0.05, whereas lower levels of antioxidant activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were noticed in the PD group as compared to controls (P < 0.05 for all). From the results, it is concluded that patients with PD have high oxidative stress and lower antioxidant activity, and these studied biomarkers would be used as potential diagnostic tool to measure oxidative stress in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic and pharmacologic perspectives in parkinson's disease. Despite the dopaminergic therapy which improves motor symptoms, there are still a lot of challenges to be fulfilled in Parkinson's disease. Dopamine replacement therapy is hampered by motor complications, has no efficacy on non-motor symptoms, and is not neuroprotective so does not change disease progression. Second line therapies, also mainly acting on motor symptoms, such as deep brain stimulation, and continuous administration of levodopa or apomorphine by pumps, can benefit to a limited number of patients but are associated with a high burden for the patients and their caregivers, and a high cost for society. Several therapeutic strategies are currently under evaluation to improve the treatment of motor fluctuations, dyskinesia, and some non-motor symptoms. The recent development of more predictive preclinical models and biomarkers of disease progression should allow fostering the development of innovative neuroprotective strategies. The stratification of patients through the combination of clinical, biological and brain imaging features will help to move towards personalized precision medicine by matching patients care to their individual progression profile.\nPerspectives th\u00e9rapeutiques et pharmacologiques dans la maladie de parkinson. Malgr\u00e9 le traitement dopaminergique qui am\u00e9liore les sympt\u00f4mes moteurs, de nombreux d\u00e9fis restent \u00e0 relever pour am\u00e9liorer la prise en charge de la maladie de Parkinson. Le traitement dopaminergique s\u2019accompagne de complications motrices, n\u2019est pas efficace sur les sympt\u00f4mes non moteurs, et n\u2019a pas d\u2019action neuroprotectrice, c\u2019est\u00e0- dire qu\u2019il ne change pas la progression de la maladie. Les traitements de seconde ligne, agissant \u00e9galement surtout sur les sympt\u00f4mes moteurs, tels que la stimulation c\u00e9r\u00e9brale profonde et les administrations continues par pompes de l\u00e9vodopa ou d\u2019apomorphine, sont b\u00e9n\u00e9fiques pour un nombre limit\u00e9 de patients mais aux d\u00e9pens de contraintes importantes pour les patients et l\u2019entourage, et d\u2019un co\u00fbt important pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. De nombreuses strat\u00e9gies th\u00e9rapeutiques sont en cours d\u2019\u00e9valuation pour am\u00e9liorer les fluctuations motrices, les dyskin\u00e9sies et les sympt\u00f4mes non moteurs. Le d\u00e9veloppement concomitant de mod\u00e8les pr\u00e9cliniques plus pr\u00e9dictifs et de biomarqueurs de progression de la maladie devrait permettre d\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le d\u00e9veloppement de strat\u00e9gies neuroprotectrices innovantes. La stratification des patients par la combinaison de donn\u00e9es cliniques, biologiques et d\u2019imagerie c\u00e9r\u00e9brale aidera le passage vers une m\u00e9decine de pr\u00e9cision pour une prise en charge personnalis\u00e9e des patients.",

These symptoms are diverse: psychic manifestations such as anxiety, depression or behavioral disorders, dysautonomia, pain, alteration of smell or vision, and sleep disturbances. These symptoms can be dramatic and confounding such as those seen in nonmotor fluctuations. Altogether, non-motor symptoms contribute to the impairment of the quality of life of the patients. Therefore, they must be systematically analyzed, and, when possible corrected.\nLes troubles non moteurs de la maladie de parkinson et leur prise en charge.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease treatment: from honey moon to motor fluctuations. The treatment of Parkinson's disease remains symptomatic but allows, for many years, a good control of motor and non-motor signs. This treatment is complex and has to deal with very heterogeneous motor and non-motor presentation. Initial treatment is started once disability occurs and is mainly based either on levodopa or dopamine agonists. When motor fluctuations start, the principle of treatment is to optimize levodopa intake and combine various drugs depending on the clinical presentation. Third line strategies of treatment such as pumps or deep brain stimulation may be proposed at this stage. Later on, when doparesistant signs appear, treatment has often to be simplified, cognitive decline to be taken in charge and physiotherapy is crucial even if physical exercise is of great importance whatever the stage of the disease. Finally, non-motor manifestations have to be carefully addressed throughout the course of the disease because their impact on quality of life is sometimes greater than the one of motor signs.\nPrise en charge de la maladie de parkinson : de la lune de miel aux fluctuations Le traitement de la maladie de Parkinson reste \u00e0 ce jour symptomatique mais permet le contr\u00f4le des signes moteurs et non moteurs de la maladie pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es. Il est complexe du fait de la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 des signes \u00e0 la fois moteurs et non moteurs. Le traitement initial est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019une g\u00eane appara\u00eet, et la discussion principale est celle du choix entre L-dopa et agonistes dopaminergiques. Au stade des fluctuations motrices, les options sont nombreuses et reposent sur l\u2019optimisation de la dopath\u00e9rapie et la combinaison avec d\u2019autres traitements selon les manifestations observ\u00e9es. Les th\u00e9rapies de recours telles que les pompes ou la stimulation c\u00e9r\u00e9brale profonde peuvent \u00eatre propos\u00e9es \u00e0 ce stade. La phase de d\u00e9clin se caract\u00e9rise par la pr\u00e9sence de signes dopa-r\u00e9sistants et, \u00e0 ce stade, il est souvent n\u00e9cessaire de simplifier le traitement, de prendre en charge le d\u00e9clin cognitif et de renforcer la physioth\u00e9rapie. L\u2019exercice physique est important \u00e0 tous les stades, de m\u00eame que la prise en compte des troubles neuropsychiques li\u00e9s \u00e0 la maladie ou induits par les traitements car ils contribuent dans une grande mesure \u00e0 la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de la qualit\u00e9 de vie des patients.",

    "abstract": "Palliative care addresses the suffering of patients and families affected by progressive illness through the management of medical symptoms, psychosocial issues, and spiritual concerns. Although there is an emerging interest in applying palliative care to Parkinson's disease (PD), potential palliative care needs have not been systematically investigated in PD patients. Our primary objective was to determine the prevalence of clinically significant symptomatic, psychosocial, and spiritual issues in PD and understand their impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Secondary objectives included comparing the level of palliative care needs of PD patients to advanced cancer patients and assessing preferences for advance care planning.\nNinety PD patients and 47 patients with advanced cancer were surveyed regarding potential palliative care needs, including symptom burden, mood, anticipatory grief, and spiritual well-being. PD patients completed additional scales regarding HRQOL, motor symptoms, cognitive impairment, and preferences regarding advance care planning.\nPotential palliative care needs, including high symptom burden and grief, were common in PD patients and contributed to HRQOL even when controlling for depression and motor severity. In all domains investigated, PD patients had similar or higher levels of palliative care needs as patients with advanced cancer. PD patients expressed a desire to complete advance directives early in the disease course and with a physician.\nPalliative care needs contribute to HRQOL in PD and are of similar severity as cancer patients. This study supports and helps focus efforts to integrate palliative care principles in PD care across the spectrum of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 30% of patients with Parkinson's disease experience mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), often affecting executive functions. Our objective was to assess tolerability, safety and preliminarily efficacy of Goal Management Training\u00ae (GMT) for PD-MCI. GMT was administered at home, for five weeks. Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX), Parkinson Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), Zoo Map Test and Dementia Rating Scale-II were administered before, one and four weeks after Adapted-GMT. Reliable Change Index (RCI) was calculated. One participant completed GMT with caregiver. Executive complaints decreased (DEX RCIs between -2.10 and -1.68), PDQ-39 was maintained (RCI = -0.18). Adapted-GMT seems safe for PD-MCI, but efficacy remains doubtful.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases that affects tens of millions of Americans. PD is highly progressive and heterogeneous. Quite a few studies have been conducted in recent years on predictive or disease progression modeling of PD using clinical and biomarkers data. Neuroimaging, as another important information source for neurodegenerative disease, has also arisen considerable interests from the PD community. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for fusing multiple modalities of brain images in relationship prediction which is useful for distinguishing PD cases from controls. On Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort, our approach achieved 0.9537\u00b10.0587 AUC, compared with 0.6443\u00b10.0223 AUC achieved by traditional approaches such as PCA.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer progressive neurodegeneration and experience motor and nonmotor symptoms. Oropharyngeal dysfunctions are increasingly recognized as nonmotor PD symptoms that negatively impact a patient's quality of life. This module was primarily created to update dental health professionals and educate dental students on the oral health needs of patients with PD, with an emphasis on interprofessional collaboration and evidence-based dentistry. The module may also benefit other health professionals from different disciplines working with patients with PD.\nThe module was developed to be delivered in one 55-minute large-group session followed by a short assessment and case study discussion. Associated materials include PowerPoint slides with transcript, a narrated video version of the PowerPoint lecture, a quiz, and the case study. Thirty-four first-year dental students were invited to watch the narrated presentation, complete a pre-/postsurvey, and take the quiz.\nAll participants agreed dental schools should provide education regarding oral health in patients with neurological disorders, as only 29% of them had previously taken a related class. After watching the presentation, students reported that most of the information was new content and that the difficulty level met their expectations. All students reported that the lecture increased their interest in interprofessional collaboration. In a quiz taken immediately after the presentation, the class average grade was 82.7, with 94% of the class passing the quiz with a grade of 70 or more.\nEducating dental professionals regarding care of patients with PD must emphasize interprofessional collaborations among health care providers.",

    "abstract": "Recently, several randomized controlled trials on the use of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine as treatments for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (CIND-PD), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) were completed. The present study provided a meta-analysis of these studies to evaluate the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine on CIND-PD, PDD and DLB. The Cochrane Library, Pubmed, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched to retrieve eligible studies. As primary efficacy outcomes, cognitive function, global impression, behavioral symptoms and motor function were selected, while falling and adverse events were regarded as safety outcomes. Of note, domain-specific cognitive function was assessed as a primary efficacy outcome and falling as a safety outcome, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied previously in CIND-PD, PDD and DLB. A total of 15 trials were included in the present meta-analysis. The results revealed that treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors resulted in improvements in cognitive function, the clinician's global impression, behavioral symptoms and motor function, in accordance with the results of previous studies. Furthermore, it was revealed that cholinesterase inhibitors had a significant effect on attention, processing speed, executive functions, memory and language; however, they did not improve visuospatial cognition compared with placebos. Memantine had a significant effect on attention, processing speed and executive functions. In addition, cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine did not significantly reduce falling. It was demonstrated that an increased number of adverse events occurred in the pooled cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine group, compared with that in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR)=1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-1.16; P=0.001); however, in the subgroup analysis, only the rivastigmine group experienced significantly more adverse events than the placebo group (85 vs. 73%; RR=1.18; 95% CI: 1.08-1.29; P=0.0001), but donepezil and memantine did not produce any significant adverse events. In conclusion, cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine have an effect not only on global cognitive function and motor function, but also on attention, processing speed, executive functions, memory and language. However, careful monitoring of the side effects of rivastigmine may be required. Further clinical trials are required to verify these conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disorder characterized by loss of dopamine (DA) in the nigro-striatal dopamine (NSD) system with the primary symptoms of bradykinaesia, rigidity, tremor, and altered gate. Secondary symptoms including depression, insomnia, involuntary movement, and psychiatric side effects are also commonly observed. While the treatment focus for the past 50 years has been aimed at replacing deficient DA, to relieve the primary symptoms, more recent studies have suggested that the circadian system plays a critical role in the etiology and treatment of this disorder. Several case studies and open label trials have implemented bright light therapy (BT) in an attempt to repair sleep, depression and even the primary motor symptoms of this disorder, however controlled studies are yet to be fully implemented. In this controlled trial, patients that had been maintained on BT daily for 4 months to 5 years previously were assigned to one of three groups: continued polychromatic light, continued with red light or discontinued polychromatic light for a 2 week period. The Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDSUPDRS), The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), The Beck Depression Inventory II, The Beck Anxiety Inventory, The Epworth Sleep Scale (ESS) and a global rating scale were used to assess patients prior to and at 1 and 2 weeks after commencing the trial. Patients continuing polychromatic BT showed significant improvement on the MDSUPDRS Rating Scale (12 points; ",

    "abstract": "Clinicians and researchers commonly use global cognitive assessments to screen for impairment. Currently there are no published studies directly comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 in PD. The objective of this study was to identify the relative sensitivity and specificity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 in PD.\nThe Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 were administered to training and validation cohorts. Cutoff scores were determined within the training cohort (n = 85) to optimize sensitivity and specificity for cognitive impairment and were applied to an independent validation cohort (n = 521).\nThe Montreal Cognitive Assessment was consistently sensitive across training and validation cohorts (90.0% and 80.3%, respectively), whereas the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 was not (87.5% and 60.3%, respectively). In individual domains, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment remained sensitive to memory and visuospatial impairments (91.9% and 87.8%, respectively), whereas the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 was sensitive to executive impairments (86.2%).\nThe Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 demonstrated individual strengths. Future work should focus on developing domain-specific cognitive screening tools for PD. \u00a9 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Limited access to medicines can impact negatively on outcomes in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). The study objectives were to determine the availability and assess the affordability of antiparkinsonian medications in pharmacies across Nigeria.\nThis was a cross-sectional nationwide study utilizing the World Health Organization/Health Action Initiative methodology. Strategically selected private- and public-sector pharmacies in the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria were surveyed for availability of medicines for management of early and advanced PD. The nine categories were: levodopa/peripheral decarboxylase inhibitors, dopamine receptor agonists, monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors, anticholinergics, catechol-o-methyl transferase inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, antidementia drugs, and miscellaneous (e.g., drugs for orthostatism, urinary incontinence, and sleep disturbance). Unaffordability was defined as paying more than 1 days' wages (>N600 or\u2009>\u2009US$1.67) for a standard 30-day supply.\nOne hundred twenty-three pharmacies were surveyed (62 private [50.4%] and 61 public sector [49.6%]; range of 15-25 pharmacies in each geopolitical zone). Private exceeded public-sector availability across all nine categories of PD medicines (\nPD medicines access is limited in Nigeria. Strategies, including engagement of stakeholders to consider interventions to improve and prioritize PD medicines access, are urgently warranted.",

    "abstract": "The use of alternate frequencies, amplitudes, and pulse widths to manage motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is of clinical interest, but currently lacks systematic evidence.\nSystematically review whether alternate STN-DBS settings influence the therapy's efficacy for managing PD motor symptoms.\nSystematic searches identified studies that; involved bilateral STN-DBS PD patients; manipulated\u2009\u2265\u20091 STN-DBS parameter (e.g., amplitude); assessed\u2009\u2265\u20091 motor symptom (e.g., tremor); and contrasted the experimental and chronic stimulation settings. A Mantel-Haenszel random-effects meta-analysis compared the UPDRS-III sub-scores at low (60-Hz) and high frequencies (\u2009\u2265\u2009130\u2009Hz). Inter-study heterogeneity was assessed with the Cohen's \u03c7\nOf the 21 included studies, 17 investigated the effect of alternate stimulation frequencies, five examined alternate stimulation amplitudes, and two studied changes in pulse width. Given the available data, meta-analyses were only possible for alternate stimulation frequencies. Analysis of the heterogeneity amongst the included studies indicated significant variability between studies and, on the basis of the GRADE framework, the pooled evidence from the meta-analysis studies was of very low quality due to the significant risks of bias.\nThe meta-analysis reported a very low quality of evidence for the efficacy of low-frequency STN-DBS for managing PD motor symptoms. Furthermore, it highlighted that lower amplitudes lead to the re-emergence of motor symptoms and further research is needed to understand the potential benefits of alternate STN-DBS parameters for PD patients.",

    "results": "Of the 21 included studies, 17 investigated the effect of alternate stimulation frequencies, five examined alternate stimulation amplitudes, and two studied changes in pulse width. Given the available data, meta-analyses were only possible for alternate stimulation frequencies. Analysis of the heterogeneity amongst the included studies indicated significant variability between studies and, on the basis of the GRADE framework, the pooled evidence from the meta-analysis studies was of very low quality due to the significant risks of bias.",

We conducted a search of PubMed up until June 1, 2018 and personal files to identify relevant publications.\n22q11.2DS-associated PD is responsible for approximately 0.5% of early-onset PD. The hallmark motor symptoms and neuropathology of PD, and typical findings of reduced striatal dopamine transporter binding with molecular imaging, are present in 22q11.2DS-associated PD. Mean age at PD onset in 22q11.2DS is relatively young (\u223c40 years). Patients with 22q11.2DS-associated PD show a good response to levodopa.\nFurther recognition of 22q11.2DS and study of PD in people with 22q11.2DS could provide insights into the mechanisms that cause PD in the general population. 22q11.2DS may serve as an identifiable PD model to study prodromal PD and disease-modifying treatments.",

    "abstract": "While a number of genetic mutations are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), it is also widely acknowledged that the environment plays a significant role in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Epidemiological evidence suggests that occupational exposure to pesticides (e.g., dieldrin, paraquat, rotenone, maneb, and ziram) is associated with a higher risk of developing PD in susceptible populations. Within dopaminergic neurons, environmental chemicals can have an array of adverse effects resulting in cell death, such as aberrant redox cycling and oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, unfolded protein response, ubiquitin-proteome system dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and metabolic disruption. More recently, our understanding of how pesticides affect cells of the central nervous system has been strengthened by computational biology. New insight has been gained about transcriptional and proteomic networks, and the metabolic pathways perturbed by pesticides. These networks and cell signaling pathways constitute potential therapeutic targets for intervention to slow or mitigate neurodegenerative diseases. Here we review the epidemiological evidence that supports a role for specific pesticides in the etiology of PD and identify molecular profiles amongst these pesticides that may contribute to the disease. Using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, these transcripts were compared to those regulated by the PD-associated neurotoxicant MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine). While many transcripts are already established as those related to PD (alpha-synuclein, caspases, leucine rich repeat kinase 2, and parkin2), lesser studied targets have emerged as \"pesticide/PD-associated transcripts\" [e.g., phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class C (Pigc), allograft inflammatory factor 1 (Aif1), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3, and DNA damage inducible transcript 4]. We also compared pesticide-regulated genes to a recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in PD which revealed new genetic mutant alleles; the pesticides under review regulated the expression of many of these genes (e.g., ELOVL fatty acid elongase 7, ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a1, and bridging integrator 3). The significance is that these proteins may contribute to pesticide-related increases in PD risk. This review collates information on transcriptome responses to PD-associated pesticides to develop a mechanistic framework for quantifying PD risk with exposures.",

    "abstract": "There are currently no treatments that hinder or halt the inexorable progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). While the etiology of PD remains elusive, evidence suggests that early dysfunction of mitochondrial respiration and homeostasis play a major role in PD pathogenesis. The mitochondrial structural protein Mic60, also known as mitofilin, is critical for maintaining mitochondrial architecture and function. Loss of Mic60 is associated with detrimental effects on mitochondrial homeostasis. Growing evidence now implicates Mic60 in the pathogenesis of PD. In this review, we discuss the data supporting a role of Mic60 and mitochondrial dysfunction in PD. We will also consider the potential of Mic60 as a therapeutic target for treating neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the human central and peripheral nervous systems. n-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22: 6n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as well as apelin have anti-inflammatory effects in various cells. At the same time, apelin has anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects. The study was conducted to determine the effect of DHA on the distribution of apelin and apelin receptor (APJ) in the central nervous system in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model. DHA treatment decreased the return time and total down time in the Parkinson group which were measured by pole test. Besides, the ambulatory activity, distance and total locomotor activity were increased by DHA in the PD model of animals. The time mice remained on the rotating rod mile was also significantly increased by DHA treatment in MPTP injected animals. The apelin expression in the pons of mice in the Parkinson, DHA and Parkinson\u2009+\u2009DHA groups were lower compared to the Control group. When apelin and apelin receptor expressions in cerebrum were examined, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. When apelin receptor expression in cerebellum was examined, the difference between the Control and Parkinson\u2009+\u2009DHA, Parkinson and Parkinson\u2009+\u2009DHA, DHA and Parkinson\u2009+\u2009DHA groups were statistically significant. Apelin receptor expressions in pons of the Parkinson, DHA and Parkinson\u2009+\u2009DHA groups were lower compared to the Control group. Apelin protein levels of cerebellum and pons were found to be decreased in DHA group compare with Control group. In conclusion; DHA has been implicated in the expression of the apelin receptor and has reduced the expression of APJ receptor.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disturbance is a common problem among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nTo investigate the prevalence of daytime somnolence and night-time sleep disturbances; to characterise the night-time sleep disturbance in patients with daytime somnolence; and to determine the correlation between daytime somnolence and night-time sleep disturbances.\nOne hundred and sixty patients with PD were included in the study. Each patient completed the Thai version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire to evaluate excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and the PD Sleep Scale version-2 (PDSS-2) questionnaire to evaluate night-time sleep disturbance. Subjective sleep information and details about the presence or absence of sleep attack (SA) were also obtained from the patients.\nThe types of daytime somnolence found in this study were EDS, SA, and combination of EDS and SA (EDS + SA) with the prevalence rates of 22.5, 3.1 and 6.3%, respectively. The prevalence of night-time sleep disturbance was 46.9%. The most common nocturnal disturbance (82.5%) was \"get up at night to pass urine\". There was a significant positive correlation between the ESS score and PDSS-2 total score with a correlation coefficient of 0.16 (p = 0.043). Patients with \"EDS + SA\" were the most affected by nocturnal disturbances, as they represented the largest group among those patients with night-time disturbances and had the highest PDSS-2 total score (p < 0.05).\nThere are differences in nocturnal sleep disturbances among PD patients with different types of daytime somnolence. The significant positive correlation between the ESS and the PDSS-2 total scores suggests that night-time sleep disturbance may influence daytime somnolence.",

    "abstract": "Postural instability is a common disorder in Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this study was to evaluate stance stability of the subjects at the early stage of PD with both linear and nonlinear approaches. Moreover, this study aimed to find the effect of visual control on quiet stance postural control in these patients.\nSeventeen PD patients (Hoehn/Yahr scale: 1) and 17 healthy control subjects were instructed to maintain quiet postural stance in 2 conditions (opened eyes and closed eyes). Four linear (excursion, path length, velocity, root mean square) and 1 nonlinear (approximate entropy) center of pressure (COP) parameters were calculated. A 2 \u00d7 2 mixed ANOVA was used for the final analysis.\nAlthough there was no difference between the stability of PD patients and healthy control subjects based on excursion of COP in both mediolateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) directions, other linear parameters (path length of COP sways, velocity of COP sways, and root mean square in both ML and AP planes) showed that PD patients were significantly unstable compared to normal subjects (p value < 0.05). Vision influenced the stability of both groups significantly. The interaction of vision and group was not significant based on linear and nonlinear stability parameters.\nAlthough patients in the early stage of PD seem to be unstable based on COP linear measures, their postural control system is still flexible to adapt to environmental perturbations in quiet stance and they are not more visually dependent than healthy subjects to control stability in this position.",

    "abstract": "The impairment of lexical-semantic inhibition mechanisms in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains a source of contention. In order to observe whether people with PD are able to suppress irrelevant semantic information during picture naming, the present study employed an object-based negative priming paradigm with 16 participants with PD and 13 healthy controls. The task required participants to name a red target image while ignoring a superimposed, green distractor image. The semantic relationship between the distractor image and the target image of the subsequent trial was manipulated, such that the distractor image was identical, semantically related, or semantically unrelated to said target image. The PD group and the control group were slower in naming a target image that had previously served as a distractor image, relative to naming a target image that was unrelated to the previous distractor image. Thus, a negative priming effect was present in both groups. Furthermore, no significant difference in the magnitude of this effect was observed between the control and PD groups. When considered in the context of existing literature surrounding negative priming in PD, these results suggest that inhibition is subserved by multiple, domain-specific mechanisms and that the inhibitory processing of visual-semantic stimuli is intact in PD.",

    "abstract": "Studies have suggested that free radicals-induced neurodegeneration is one of the many studies of Parkinson Disease (PD). Quercetin as a natural polyphenol has been regarded as a significant player in altering the progression of neurodegenerative diseases by protecting from damages caused by free radicals. Owing to its poor water solubility, preparation of its oral formulation is urgently needed. Recently, nanocrystal technique as an effective way has been introduced for oral administration of drugs.\nThis study investigated the neuroprotective effects of quercetin nanocrystals on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced Parkinson-like model in male rats. Quercetin nanocrystals were prepared by the Evaporative Precipitation of Nanosuspension (EPN) method.\nAdministration of quercetin and its nanocrystals (10 and 25 mg/kg) prevented disruption of memory, increased antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase and catalase) and total glutathione and reduced Malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the hippocampal area.\nThe present study results demonstrated that quercetin nanocrystals with greater bioavailability is effective than quercetin alone in treatment of Parkinson-like model in rat.",

    "abstract": "The combination of phasic and tonic neuromuscular processes are involved in the maintenance of normal upright posture. The latter is of particular importance in some pathologies, such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), which is known by one of its cardinal symptoms-tonic dysfunction (i.e., rigidity). Changes in tonic function may also occur during healthy aging. In this investigation, somatosensory input was manipulated by changing the support surface orientation for prolonged periods of quiet stance (QS). The aim was to shed light on how long-term tonic responses called postural lean after-effects are affected by aging and age-related neuropathology. Forty one participants were tested: 19 healthy young (25\u00b15 years), 13 healthy older (63\u00b18 years), and 9 adults with PD (63\u00b15 years). Baseline conditions were eyes-closed QS on a stable surface or standing on an unstable, sway-referenced (SR) surface. Four experimental conditions combined two types of toes-up ramp tilt adaptation (120 s of toes-up static 7\u00b0 tilt or sinusoidal 7\u00b0 \u00b1 3\u00b0 tilt) with two types of post-adaptation (120 s of QS or SR). Results revealed postural after-effects during post-adaptation QS showing significant anterior COP shift for both young and older adults (",

    "abstract": "Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is a widely distributed serine/threonine kinase that is critical for cell death in multiple neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and stroke. However, little is known about the role of DAPK1 in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder.\nWe used Western blot and immunohistochemistry to evaluate the alteration of DAPK1. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization were used to analyze the expression of microRNAs in PD mice and patients with PD. Rotarod, open field, and pole tests were used to evaluate the locomotor ability. Immunofluorescence, Western blot, and filter traps were used to evaluate synucleinopathy in PD mice.\nWe found that DAPK1 is posttranscriptionally upregulated by a reduction in microRNA-26a (miR-26a) caused by a loss of the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha. The overexpression of DAPK1 in PD mice is positively correlated with neuronal synucleinopathy. Suppressing miR-26a or upregulating DAPK1 results in synucleinopathy, dopaminergic neuron cell death, and motor disabilities in wild-type mice. In contrast, genetic deletion of DAPK1 in dopaminergic neurons by crossing DAT-Cre mice with DAPK1 floxed mice effectively rescues the abnormalities in mice with chronic MPTP treatment. We further showed that DAPK1 overexpression promotes PD-like phenotypes by direct phosphorylation of \u03b1-synuclein at the serine 129 site. Correspondingly, a cell-permeable competing peptide that blocks the phosphorylation of \u03b1-synuclein prevents motor disorders, synucleinopathy, and dopaminergic neuron loss in the MPTP mice.\nmiR-26a/DAPK1 signaling cascades are essential in the formation of the molecular and cellular pathologies in PD.",

    "results": "We found that DAPK1 is posttranscriptionally upregulated by a reduction in microRNA-26a (miR-26a) caused by a loss of the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha. The overexpression of DAPK1 in PD mice is positively correlated with neuronal synucleinopathy. Suppressing miR-26a or upregulating DAPK1 results in synucleinopathy, dopaminergic neuron cell death, and motor disabilities in wild-type mice. In contrast, genetic deletion of DAPK1 in dopaminergic neurons by crossing DAT-Cre mice with DAPK1 floxed mice effectively rescues the abnormalities in mice with chronic MPTP treatment. We further showed that DAPK1 overexpression promotes PD-like phenotypes by direct phosphorylation of \u03b1-synuclein at the serine 129 site. Correspondingly, a cell-permeable competing peptide that blocks the phosphorylation of \u03b1-synuclein prevents motor disorders, synucleinopathy, and dopaminergic neuron loss in the MPTP mice.",

    "abstract": "Hyposmia is one of the earliest and the most common symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). The benefits of hydrogen water on motor deficits have been reported in animal PD models and PD patients, but the effects of hydrogen gas on PD patients have not been studied. We evaluated the effect of inhalation of hydrogen gas on olfactory function, non-motor symptoms, activities of daily living, and urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanine (8-OHdG) levels by a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with an 8-week washout period in 20 patients with PD. Patients inhaled either ~1.2-1.4% hydrogen-air mixture or placebo for 10 minutes twice a day for 4 weeks. Inhalation of low dose hydrogen did not significantly influence the PD clinical parameters, but it did increase urinary 8-OHdG levels by 16%. This increase in 8-OHdG is markedly less than the over 300% increase in diabetes, and is more comparable to the increase after a bout of strenuous exercise. Although increased reactive oxygen species is often associated with toxicity and disease, they also play essential roles in mediating cytoprotective cellular adaptations in a process known as hormesis. Increases of oxidative stress by hydrogen have been previously reported, along with its ability to activate the Nrf2, NF-\u03baB pathways, and heat shock responses. Although we did not observe any beneficial effect of hydrogen in our short trial, we propose that the increased 8-OHdG and other reported stress responses from hydrogen may indicate that its beneficial effects are partly or largely mediated by hormetic mechanisms. The study was approved by the ethics review committee of Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine (approval number 2015-0295). The clinical trial was registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network (identifier UMIN000019082).",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD) is based on the presence of bradykinesia and either resting tremor or rigidity and there should be no features from the history or examination to suggest an alternative cause of parkinsonism. In addition to the motor manifestations of PD, there is a long list of nonmotor symptoms, several of which occur before motor signs and are considered \"prodromal\" PD. These are classified as neuropsychiatric, autonomic, sleep, and sensory. There are many medical options for the treatment of PD but levodopa remains the mainstay. Deep brain stimulation and other advanced therapies are also available.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a predominant non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is often under recognised and undertreated. To improve identification of depression in PD it is imperative to examine objective brain-related markers. The present study addresses this gap by using electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate the processing of emotionally valanced words in PD.\nFifty non-demented PD patients, unmedicated for depression or anxiety, completed an affective priming task while EEG was simultaneously recorded. Prime and target word pairs of negative or neutral valence were presented at a short 250\u202fms stimulus onset asynchrony. Participants were asked to evaluate the valence of the target word by button press. Depression was measured using an established rating scale. Repeated measures analysis of covariance and correlational analyses were performed to examine whether event-related potentials (ERP) varied as a function of depression scores.\nKey ERP findings reveal reduced responses in parietal midline P300, N400 and Late Positive Potential (LPP) difference waves between congruent and incongruent neutral targets in patients with higher depression scores.\nComparisons of ERPs were limited by insufficient classification of participants with and without clinical depression. A majority of PD patients who had high depression scores were excluded from the analysis as they were receiving antidepressant and/or anxiolytic medications which could interfere with ERP sensitivity.\nThe present study suggests that the Pz-P300, N400 and LPP are ERP markers relates to emotional dysfunction in PD. These findings thus advance current knowledge regarding the neurophysiological markers of a common neuropsychiatric deficit in PD.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing idiopathic Parkinson's disease treatment is a challenging, multifaceted and continuous process with direct impact on patients' quality of life. The basic tenet of this task entails tailored therapy, allowing for optimal motor function with the fewest adverse effects. Apomorphine, a dopamine agonist used as rescue therapy for patients with motor fluctuations, with potential positive effects on nonmotor symptoms, is the only antiparkinsonian agent whose capacity to control motor symptoms is comparable to that of levodopa. Subcutaneous administration, either as an intermittent injection or as continuous infusion, appears to be the most effective and tolerable route. This review summarizes the historical background, structure, mechanism of action, indications, contraindications and side effects, compares apomorphine infusion therapy with other treatments, such as oral therapy, deep brain stimulation and continuous enteral infusion of levodopa/carbidopa gel, and gives practical instructions on how to initiate treatment.",

    "abstract": "Although Parkinson Disease was described a long time ago by James Parkinson and several biomarkers were used to predict the symptoms of PD, there is no accepted tool to distinguish the initial stages of this pathology. The present hypothesis discusses the Coherence Function, an Electroencephalography measure which could be used as a simple, and low-cost tool to describe the onset of cardinal signals of PD. Our hypothesis is based on three factors: beta frequency related to movement, motor action over particular cortical regions, and cortical coupling between cortical areas involved in the execution of voluntary movement. We believe that these factors support our hypothesis pointing out coherence function as an interesting measure to detect initial stages of PD.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of PD might be in difficulty, especially in the early stages. Therefore, the identification of novel biomarkers is imperative for the diagnosis and monitoring disease progression in PD. DJ-1 and \u03b1-synuclein, are two proteins that are critically involved in the pathogenesis of PD, and they have been examined as disease biomarkers in studies. However, no study exists regarding DJ-1 in plasma neural-derived exosomes. In the present study, the levels of DJ-1 and \u03b1-synuclein in plasma neural-derived exosomes were studied together in order to investigate novel biomarkers for PD. DJ-1 and \u03b1-synuclein in plasma and plasma neural-derived exosomes of the patients with PD and controls were quantified by ELISAs. The data revealed that the levels of DJ-1 and \u03b1-synuclein in plasma neural-derived exosomes and the ratio of plasma neural-derived exosomal DJ-1 to total DJ-1 were significantly higher in patients with PD, compared with controls, while levels of the two proteins in plasma exhibited no difference between the patients with PD and controls. However, no relationship was identified between biomarkers and disease progression. In addition, significant positive correlations between DJ-1 and \u03b1-synuclein in plasma neural-derived exosomes were found in the patients with PD and in healthy individuals. We hypothesize that DJ-1 in plasma neural-derived exosomes may be used as a potential biomarker as \u03b1-synuclein in PD and they might participate in the mechanism of PD together.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is the neuropathological feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and causes microglial activation and activated microglia-derived oxidative stress in the PD patients and PD animal models, resulting in neurodegeneration. The present study examined whether norfluoxetine (a metabolite of fluoxetine) could regulate neuroinflammation in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropypridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD and rescue dopamine neurons. Analysis by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry demonstrated that norfluoxetine prevents degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons ",

    "abstract": "Postural instability is a known contributing factor to balance dysfunction and increased fall risk in those with Parkinson's disease (PD). Computerized posturography employing a force platform system provides objective, quantitative assessments of postural control impairments. This study examines balance performance as measured by force platform (FP) tests in persons with PD compared to age-matched healthy adults. Secondarily, we examine if these FP measures provide diagnostic and clinically meaningful information about the underlying balance impairments in the PD population.\nParticipants-42 individuals with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage = 2.33 \u00b1 0.77) and 55 age-matched healthy adults-were assessed on three standardized balance measures on a computerized force platform system. Between groups, comparisons of FP performance were analyzed using independent \nThe PD cohort demonstrated significantly greater postural instability on the sensory organization test (SOT) measures (\nThese findings suggest FP measures provide clinically meaningful, diagnostic information in the examination of balance impairments in individuals with PD. FP measures may inform clinicians regarding intrinsic balance deficits and guide them in designing targeted balance interventions to reduce fall risk in persons with PD.",

    "abstract": "There is a mutual relationship between metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the causal relationship in this crosstalk is unclear and whether Parkinson's disease (PD) causes a posterior impact on metabolism remains unknown. Considering that, this study aimed to evaluate the appearance of possible changes in metabolic homeostasis due to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) administration, a neurotoxin that damage dopaminergic neurons leading to motor impairments that resemble the ones observed in PD. For this, male Wistar rats received bilateral 6-OHDA administration in the dorsolateral striatum, and the motor and metabolic outcomes were assessed at 7, 21, or 35 days post-surgical procedure. Dexamethasone, a diabetogenic glucocorticoid (GC), was intraperitoneally administered in the last 6 days to challenge the metabolism and reveal possible metabolic vulnerabilities caused by 6-OHDA. Controls received only vehicles. The 6-OHDA-treated rats displayed a significant decrease in locomotor activity, exploratory behavior, and motor coordination 7 and 35 days after neurotoxin administration. These motor impairments paralleled with no significant alteration in body mass, food intake, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and biochemical parameters (plasma insulin, triacylglycerol, and total cholesterol levels) until the end of the experimental protocol on days 35-38 post-6-OHDA administration. Moreover, hepatic glycogen and fat content, as well as the endocrine pancreas mass, were not altered in rats treated with 6-OHDA at the day of euthanasia (38th day after neurotoxin administration). None of the diabetogenic effects caused by dexamethasone were exacerbated in rats previously treated with 6-OHDA. Thus, we conclude that bilateral 6-OHDA administration in the striatum causes motor deficits in rats with no impact on glucose and lipid homeostasis and does not exacerbate the adverse effects caused by excess GC. These observations indicate that neurodegeneration of dopaminergic circuits in the 6-OHDA rats does not affect the metabolic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex autoimmune disease. Recent studies have identified the DNA methylation loci associated with RA and found that DNA methylation was a potential mediator of genetic risk. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. Several studies have indicated that DNA methylation levels are linked to PD, and genes related to the immune system are significantly enriched in PD-related methylation modules. Although recent studies have provided profound insights into the DNA methylation of both RA and PD, no shared co-methylation relationships have been identified to date. Therefore, we sought to identify shared co-methylation relationships linked to RA and PD. Here, we calculated the Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 225,239,700 gene pairs and determined the differences and similarities between the two diseases. The global co-methylation change between in PD cases and controls was larger than that between RA cases and controls. We found 337 gene pairs with large changes that were shared between RA and PD. This co-methylation relationship study represents a new area of study for both RA and PD and provides new ideas for further study of the shared biological mechanisms of RA and PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the Western world. It is estimated that the neuronal loss related to Parkinson's disease precedes the clinical diagnosis by more than 10 years (prodromal phase) which leads to a subtle decline that translates into non-specific clinical signs and symptoms. By leveraging diffusion magnetic resonance imaging brain (MRI) data evaluated longitudinally, at least at two different time points, we have the opportunity of detecting and measuring brain changes early on in the neurodegenerative process, thereby allowing early detection and monitoring that can enable development and testing of disease modifying therapies. In this study, we were able to define a longitudinal degenerative Parkinson's disease progression pattern using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging connectivity information. Such pattern was discovered using a ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by complex motor and nonmotor symptoms. The clinical diagnosis of PD is defined by bradykinesia and other cardinal motor features, although several nonmotor symptoms are also related to disability, an impaired quality of life, and shortened life expectancy. Levodopa, which is used as a standard pharmacotherapy for PD, has limitations including a short half-life, fluctuations in efficacy, and dyskinesias with long-term use. There have been efforts to develop complementary and alternative therapies for incurable PD. Yokukansan (YKS) is a traditional herbal medicine that is widely used for treating neurosis, insomnia, and night crying in children. The clinical efficacy of YKS for treating behavioral and psychological symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations, and impaired agitation/aggression subscale and activities of daily living scores, has mainly been investigated in the context of neurological disorders such as PD, Alzheimer's disease, and other psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, YKS has previously been found to improve clinical symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairments, pain, and tardive dyskinesia. Preclinical studies have reported that the broad efficacy of YKS for various symptoms involves its regulation of neurotransmitters including GABA, serotonin, glutamate, and dopamine, as well as the expression of dynamin and glutamate transporters, and changes in glucocorticoid hormones and enzymes such as choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase. Moreover, YKS has neuroprotective effects at various cellular levels via diverse mechanisms. In this review, we focus on the clinical efficacy and neuropharmacological effects of YKS. We discuss the possible mechanisms underpinning the effects of YKS on neuropathology and suggest that the multiple actions of YKS may be beneficial as a treatment for PD. We highlight the potential that YKS may serve as a complementary and alternative strategy for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "To examine trends in type, frequency, and effectiveness of different modes of exercise in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD).\nExercise has been shown to improve symptoms in PD patients. Recent studies suggest that dance may be a particularly helpful exercise option. However, it remains unclear how the benefits of various forms of exercise compare to dance and to each other. Information on these trends can help inform future exercise programs for PD patients.\n55 PD patients completed a survey on their exercise frequency, the impact of exercise on their symptoms, and whether they exercise alone or in groups. 9 PD patients who attend dance therapy classes completed an extended survey with additional questions comparing the benefit of dance therapy to traditional forms of exercise.\nOf the 64 patients surveyed, 67% of patients exercised at least twice a week for at least 30\u202fminutes at a time, and 28% of patients exercised alone only. Walking was most commonly reported (77%), followed by stretching (52%), and weights (28%). 97% of patients who exercised noted mitigation of their PD symptoms. Additionally, a significantly greater percentage of patients who exercised in groups reported symptomatic improvements compared to patients who only exercised alone (p\u202f=\u202f0.03).\nMore patients who participated in group exercise reported symptomatic improvement compared to those who exercised strictly alone. This suggests that the psychosocial and cognitive component of group therapy, such as dance, may confer additional benefits to PD patients.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of functional-task training on activities of daily living (ADL) in people with Parkinson`s Disease.\nWe searched five databases (Cinahl, Embase, Medline, Pedro and CENTRAL). The included studies were assessed on therapeutic validity and risk of bias. We classified the quality of evidence according to the principles of the GRADE approach. All assessments were executed independently by two researchers. The results of included studies were pooled in a meta-analyses and heterogeneity was explored by meta-regression analysis.\nOut of 2546 identified studies, 69 full texts articles were checked for eligibility, of which ten were included in the systematic review. Moderate quality of evidence indicated that exercise interventions containing functional-task training had a positive effect on ADL performance scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) in people with Parkinson (pwp) directly after intervention (UPDRS=-2.62(-5.34;0.10)). This effect improved, in favor of functional-task interventions, at the first follow-up (UPDRS=-4.0(-7.56;-0.4)). A post-hoc meta-regression analysis yielded a significant relationship between intensity rate (minutes/week) and the size of the (average) effect on ADL score.\nExercise interventions containing functional-task training have a clinically important positive effect on ADL performance in pwp directly after intervention and at first follow-up, compared to no intervention or placebo. The intensity rate of the functional-task training should be as intense as possible, within the capabilities of the person with PD. Future research is necessary to determine the exact amount of effect that can be contributed to functional-task training.",

    "abstract": "A style of dance called tango translates clinical practice into a new philosophy and rehabilitative approach for individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). The style of dance mixes music, self-generated and external cued strategies and social and emotional recovery. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of studies reporting health benefits for people diagnosed with PD who dance tango. However, there are some organisational limitations to people participating in dance classes, including having trained Tango teachers, an appropriate space for dancing, and schedule that allows for participants with motor inabilities.\nThis pilot study involved the observation of PD patients who completed four days of home exercise plus a tango dance lesson each week for five weeks.\nTen PD patients improved their quality of life, their motor score on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and their kinematic performances.\nWe propose a protocol of exercises that has been derived from the tango dance and that can be performed in a patient's home.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effects of dual-task aquatic exercises on functional mobility, balance and gait of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nA randomized, single-blind trial was used. Twenty-eight (28) individuals met the inclusion criteria and were randomized in the Experimental Group (EG) and Control Group (CG). EG was subjected to a dual-task aquatic exercise program, twice a week for 10 weeks. Each session lasted 40\u2009min, in a heated pool (33\u2009\u00b0C).

Functional mobility (\"Timed Up & Go\" Test, and \"Five Times Sit to Stand\" Test), balance (Berg Balance Scale) and gait (Dynamic Gait Index) were verified.\n25 individuals were analyzed (14\u2009EG and 11 CG).

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is accompanied by motor impairments due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. Levodopa (L-dopa) has been the gold standard therapy for PD since the 1960s; however, its neurotoxic features accelerate PD progression through auto-oxidation or the induction of dyskinetic movements. Ukgansan (UGS) is a well-known prescription for treating PD in traditional medicines of East Asia, and its anti-PD function has been experimentally evaluated. The present study investigated whether UGS attenuates (1) motor dysfunction and dopaminergic neuronal damage when co-treated with L-dopa and (2) L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD mice. Although L-dopa was found to reduce motor dysfunctions, it failed to decrease the dopaminergic neuronal damage and increased the expression of dopamine receptor 1 (D1R) and 2 (D2R) in the 6-OHDA-injected mouse striatum. Co-treatment with UGS resulted in normal striatal histology and ameliorated motor impairments. In addition, UGS suppressed the dyskinesia induced by chronic L-dopa treatment while restoring the dopaminergic neurons in the striatum. For the underlying mechanism, UGS reduced the overexpression of D1R-related signaling proteins, such as phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, \u0394FosB, and c-fos in the striatum. Overall, the results suggest that the effect of UGS could be complementary to L-dopa by ameliorating motor dysfunction, restoring the dopaminergic neurons, and suppressing the dyskinetic movements in PD.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that non-motor symptoms are a core feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). A dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system seems to be present in PD, supporting the coexistence of urological and cardiovascular non-motor features. We evaluated whether bladder dysfunctions in patients with PD are linked to blood pressure dysregulation. Twenty-eight mild PD patients, previously submitted to a urodynamic evaluation, underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate monitoring to allow assessment of their circadian blood pressure profile; the occurrence of postprandial hypotension and orthostatic hypotension was also investigated. No significant differences in blood pressure control were detected between bladder hyperreflexic and normoreflexic subjects. Our findings support different origins of urological and cardiovascular impairments in PD.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and freezing of gait (FOG) have impaired postural control. Recent studies using foot sensory stimulation delivered by means of automated mechanical peripheral stimulation (AMPS) have demonstrated improvements of gait in individuals with PD. This study aimed to investigate the effects of AMPS on postural control in individuals with PD and FOG. Thirty-three subjects participated in this randomized controlled trial. Participants were allocated to two groups: AMPS and AMPS SHAM. Subjects underwent eight sessions of real (AMPS) or placebo AMPS (AMPS SHAM) once every three/four days. Postural control was assessed by means of posturography before the first and after the eighth session of treatment. We did not find positive effects of AMPS on center of pressure parameters. Thus, it seems that AMPS has no positive effect in terms of improving static postural control in individuals with PD and FOG.",

    "abstract": "Zonisamide is a relatively recent drug for Parkinson's disease. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the antiparkinsonian effects of zonisamide. However, it is still unclear whether the effect of zonisamide is mainly due to dopaminergic modification in the striatum, or if zonisamide works through nondopaminergic pathways. We conducted the present study to determine the mechanism that is mainly responsible for zonisamide's effects in Parkinson's disease. We examined the effects of zonisamide on motor symptoms in a hemiparkinsonian rat model when administered singly, coadministered with levodopa, a dopamine precursor, or apomorphine, a D1 and D2 dopamine receptor agonist. We used 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned hemiparkinsonian rats, which were allocated to one of five groups: 14 rats received levodopa only (6\u2009mg/kg), 12 rats received levodopa (6\u2009mg/kg) plus zonisamide (50\u2009mg/kg), six rats received apomorphine only (0.05\u2009mg/kg), six rats received apomorphine (0.05\u2009mg/kg) plus zonisamide (50\u2009mg/kg), and six rats received zonisamide only (50\u2009mg/kg). The drugs were administered once daily for 15\u2009days. We evaluated abnormal involuntary movement every 20\u2009min during a 3\u2009h period following the injection of drugs on treatment Days 1, 8, and 15. Western blot analyses for dopamine decarboxylase and vesicular monoamine transferase-2 were performed using striatal tissues in the lesioned side of rats in the levodopa only group (",

    "abstract": "Dietary habits may differ between Parkinson's disease (PD) patients of different ethnicities. The primary aim of this cross-sectional analysis was to compare dietary habits in a multiethnic PD population and investigate potential nonmotor differences. All patients completed a dietary habits questionnaire. Besides basic demographics, patients' motor involvement (Hoehn and Yahr (HY)) and nonmotor symptoms (Nonmotor Symptoms Scale; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) were assessed. 139 PD patients were included (mean age 66.8 \u00b1 11.6 years; 61.2% male; mean disease duration 6.2 \u00b1 5.2 years; median HY 3): 47.5% were White, 24.5% Asian, and 28.0% Black African and Caribbean (BAC). We found dietary differences between the groups, including a greater frequency of vegetarians and greater consumption of cumin, turmeric, and cinnamon as well as lower consumption of beef in Asian patients than in White and BAC and greater consumption of chili than in White patients and higher consumption of pork in White than Asian and BAC patients. There were no significant differences in dietary supplement consumption after correction for multiple comparisons. None of the dietary factors examined were associated with differences in nonmotor symptoms. Diet and supplement use vary in PD patients across ethnicities, this is both a problem and opportunity for nutritional medicine research. These data support the importance of considering ethnic diversity as part of recruitment strategy in nutrition and clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of aging. The hallmark pathophysiology includes the development of neuronal Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra of the midbrain with subsequent loss of dopaminergic neurons. These neuronal losses lead to the characteristic motor symptoms of bradykinesia, rigidity, and rest tremor. In addition to these cardinal motor symptoms patients with PD experience a wide range of non-motor symptoms, the most important being cognitive impairments that in many circumstances lead to dementia. People with PD experience a wide range of cognitive impairments; in this review we will focus on memory impairment in PD and specifically episodic memory, which are memories of day-to-day events of life. Importantly, these memory impairments severely impact the lives of patients and caregivers alike. Traditionally episodic memory is considered to be markedly dependent on the hippocampus; therefore, it is important to understand the exact nature of PD episodic memory deficits in relation to hippocampal function and dysfunction. In this review, we discuss an aspect of episodic memory called recognition memory and its subcomponents called recollection and familiarity. Recognition memory is believed to be impaired in PD; thus, we discuss what aspects of the hippocampus are expected to be deficient in function as they relate to these recognition memory impairments. In addition to the hippocampus as a whole, we will discuss the role of hippocampal subfields in recognition memory impairments.",

    "abstract": "Interleaving stimulation (ILS) in deep brain stimulation (DBS) provides individualized stimulation of 2 contacts delivered in alternating order. Currently, limited information on the utility of ILS exists. The aims of this study were to determine the practical applications and outcomes of ILS DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD), tremor, and dystonia.\nWe performed a single-center, unblinded, retrospective chart review of all patients with DBS attempted on ILS at our referral center assessing for rationale and outcomes.\nFifty patients (PD, n = 27; tremor, n = 7; dystonia, n = 16 patients) tried ILS for 2 rationales: management of adverse effects (n = 29) and to improve clinical efficacy (n = 21). A total of 19 patients demonstrated improvement with ILS for adverse effect management predominately for the treatment of dyskinesias (n = 12). In the vast majority of dyskinetic patients, a contact added into the rostral zona incerta with ILS was performed. Nine out of 21 patients demonstrated improved clinical efficacy with ILS with all 6 PD patients who tried ILS for this rationale demonstrating benefit.\nIn PD, ILS provided benefits for dyskinesias and parkinsonism, with minimal improvement of other adverse effects. In tremor and dystonia, marginal effects in terms of mitigation of adverse effects and improvement of clinical outcomes were evident.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure indicated for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Whether similar benefits may be realized by patients with early PD, however, is currently unclear, especially given the potential risks of the procedure. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the relative efficacy and safety of DBS in comparison to best medical therapy (BMT) in the treatment of PD. It also aimed to compare the efficacy of DBS between patients with early and advanced PD. A systematic search was performed in Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central\u00a0Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DBS to BMT in PD patients were included. Outcome measures were impairment/disability using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), quality of life (QoL) using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), levodopa equivalent dose (LED) reduction, and rates of serious adverse events (SAE). Eight\u00a0eligible RCTs (n = 1,189) were included in the meta-analysis, two of which recruited early PD patients. Regarding efficacy outcomes, there were significant improvements in UPDRS, PDQ-39, and LED scores in favour of DBS (P < 0.00001). There was a significantly greater reduction of LED in patients with early PD (P < 0.00001), but no other differences between early and advanced PD patients were found. The risk of a patient experiencing an SAE was significantly higher in the DBS group (P = 0.005), as was the total number of SAEs (P < 0.00188). Overall, DBS was superior to BMT at improving impairment/disability, QoL, and reducing medication doses, but these benefits need to be weighed against the higher risk of SAEs. There was insufficient evidence to determine the impact of the PD stage on the efficacy of DBS.",

    "abstract": "The association between physical activity and the risk of Parkinson disease (PD) has been increasingly recognized. However, to our knowledge, a comprehensive assessment of the quantitative dose-response association between physical activity and PD risk has not been performed previously.\nTo quantify the dose-response association between physical activity and the risk of developing PD.\nPubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were systematically searched for peer-reviewed articles published through February 2018 reporting the association between physical activity and PD risk.\nProspective studies that examined the association between physical activity and PD risk were included.\nData were extracted independently by 2 investigators. Adjusted risk estimates were extracted and pooled using a random-effects model. The study adhered to Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) reporting guidelines.\nThe main outcome was the incidence of PD diagnoses confirmed by the treating neurologists or the authoritative medical records.\nEight prospective studies totaling 544\u202f336 participants included 2192 patients with PD with a median (range) follow-up period of 12 (6.1-22.0) years were identified. A significantly reduced risk of PD was associated with the highest levels of either total physical activity (relative risk, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68-0.91) or moderate to vigorous physical activity (relative risk, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.87), with stronger associations among men than among women. In contrast, light physical activity was not associated with PD risk (relative risk, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.60-1.23). The dose-response analysis revealed that for each 10 metabolic equivalent of task-hours/week increase in total or moderate to vigorous physical activity, the risk of PD among men decreased by 10% and 17%, respectively. No linear dose-response association was found between physical activity and PD risk among women.\nThis analysis revealed an inverse dose-response association between physical activity and PD risk among men; importantly, even moderate exercise was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of PD. Future studies with quantified measurements of physical activity will help identify the precise relative risk estimates for various levels of activity with respect to PD risk.",

    "results": "Eight prospective studies totaling 544\u202f336 participants included 2192 patients with PD with a median (range) follow-up period of 12 (6.1-22.0) years were identified. A significantly reduced risk of PD was associated with the highest levels of either total physical activity (relative risk, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68-0.91) or moderate to vigorous physical activity (relative risk, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.87), with stronger associations among men than among women. In contrast, light physical activity was not associated with PD risk (relative risk, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.60-1.23). The dose-response analysis revealed that for each 10 metabolic equivalent of task-hours/week increase in total or moderate to vigorous physical activity, the risk of PD among men decreased by 10% and 17%, respectively. No linear dose-response association was found between physical activity and PD risk among women.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD)-specific neurons, grown in standard 2D cultures, typically only display weak endophenotypes. The cultivation of PD patient-specific neurons, derived from induced pluripotent stem cells carrying the LRRK2-G2019S mutation, is optimized in 3D microfluidics. The automated image analysis algorithms are implemented to enable pharmacophenomics in disease-relevant conditions. In contrast to 2D cultures, this 3D approach reveals robust endophenotypes. High-content imaging data show decreased dopaminergic differentiation and branching complexity, altered mitochondrial morphology, and increased cell death in LRRK2-G2019S neurons compared to isogenic lines without using stressor agents. Treatment with the LRRK2 inhibitor 2 (Inh2) rescues LRRK2-G2019S-dependent dopaminergic phenotypes. Strikingly, a holistic analysis of all studied features shows that the genetic background of the PD patients, and not the LRRK2-G2019S mutation, constitutes the strongest contribution to the phenotypes. These data support the use of advanced in vitro models for future patient stratification and personalized drug development.",

    "abstract": "There is longstanding controversy surrounding the possible link between essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Inconsistent and unreliable diagnostic criteria may in part account for some of the difficulties in defining the relationship between these two common movement disorders.\nReferences for this systematic review were identified using PubMed with the search terms \"essential tremor\" AND \"Parkinson's disease\" with articles published in English between 1960 and September 2018 included.\nIn this review we provide evidence that some patients diagnosed with ET have an increased risk of developing PD years or decades after onset of action tremor. There are several still unresolved questions about the link between the two disorders including lack of verifiable diagnostic criteria for the two disorders and marked overlap in phenomenology. Here we review clinical, epidemiologic, imaging, pathologic, and genetic studies that address the ET-PD relationship. Several lines of evidence support the association between ET and PD, including overlapping motor and non-motor features, relatively high prevalence of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (26-43%) in ET patients, increased prevalence of PD in patients with longstanding antecedent ET, increased prevalence of ET in family members of patients with PD, and the presence of Lewy bodies in the brains of some ET patients (15-24%).\nThere is a substantial body of evidence supporting the association between ET and PD within at least a subset of patients, although the nature and possible pathogenic mechanisms of the relationship are not well understood.",

    "results": "In this review we provide evidence that some patients diagnosed with ET have an increased risk of developing PD years or decades after onset of action tremor. There are several still unresolved questions about the link between the two disorders including lack of verifiable diagnostic criteria for the two disorders and marked overlap in phenomenology. Here we review clinical, epidemiologic, imaging, pathologic, and genetic studies that address the ET-PD relationship. Several lines of evidence support the association between ET and PD, including overlapping motor and non-motor features, relatively high prevalence of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (26-43%) in ET patients, increased prevalence of PD in patients with longstanding antecedent ET, increased prevalence of ET in family members of patients with PD, and the presence of Lewy bodies in the brains of some ET patients (15-24%).",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene have been associated with the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). An induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line was generated from a 60-year old patient diagnosed with PD and carrying a new mutation variant p.R301C in GBA. Using non-integrating Sendai virus-based technology, we utilized OCT3/4, SOX2, c-MYC and KLF4 transcription factors to reprogram skin fibroblasts into iPSCs. The generated iPSC line retained the mutation, displayed expression of common pluripotency markers, differentiated into the three germ layers, and exhibited normal karyotype. The iPSC line can be further used for studying PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to study the neural bases of cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease for several years. Traditionally, task-based fMRI has been applied to study specific cognitive functions, providing information on disease-related alterations and regarding the physiological bases of normal cognition, the dopaminergic system, and the frontostriatal circuits. More recently, functional connectivity techniques using resting-state fMRI data have been developed. Unconstrained by specific cognitive tasks, these techniques allow assessing whole-brain patterns of connectivity believed to be useful proxies for the underlying functional architecture of the brain. These methods have shown that different types of Parkinson's disease-related cognitive deficits are associated with patterns of altered connectivity within and between resting-state intrinsic connectivity networks. Although methodological standardization and the vulnerability of fMRI techniques to artifacts mandate further technical refinement, early studies provide encouraging results regarding the potential of fMRI-derived parameters for the ultimate goal of individual-subject classification.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is one of the most salient non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive decline poses a significant burden on the patient as well as the caregiver and a better understanding of the underlying pathological processes will aid in directing disease-specific treatment. In recent years, significant progress in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of cognition in PD has been made using neuroimaging modalities. In this review, we will discuss the evidence for gray matter atrophy and cortical thinning, diffusivity changes and white matter hyperintensities in dementia, mild cognitive impairment and in several cognitive domains. Structural MRI studies have revealed considerable changes in gray and white matter in PD patients with cognitive dysfunction, showing marked atrophy and diffusivity changes in patients with dementia. The neural substrates of mild cognitive impairment in PD are more variable, perhaps reflecting a heterogeneous cohort with patients showing deficits in various cognitive domains. This review further highlights the potential areas of future research avenues in cognitive impairment in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most severe human neurodegenerative diseases that is mainly represented by sporadic form with multifactorial nature and commonly diagnosed in persons over 65 years of age. Current data on molecular mechanisms of PD development and their connection with processes of aging have been given in the review. Mechanisms of conformational control and selective degradation of proteins in the cell, possible trigger factors initiating the cascade of pathological reactions have been analyzed. Perspectives to solve the problem of elimination of basic causes of PD incurability (late diagnosis, and ineffective treatment) related to determination of reliable non-motor markers of the preclinical identification and early disorder correction of integrative brain functions have been evaluated. The basic attention is paid to an analysis of early sleep and behavior disorders in PD and aging. Known at the present moment endogenous neuroprotective factors capable to inhibit the neurodegenerative process in this disease have been considered.\n\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044c

    "abstract": "For investigation of pathogenetic patterns of Parkinson's disease, it is important to adequately assess the mechanisms of age-related involution and morphological changes that are formed in the brain during this process. Clinical symptoms, detected in Parkinson's disease (rigidity, hypokinesia, tremor), indicate the involvement in the pathological process of nigrostriate brain formations due to the death of dopamine neurons in the compact part of the substantia nigra. At the same time, the loss of these neurons, as well as the change in the number of neuroglia cells in the substantia nigra of the brain, are detected not only in Parkinson's disease, but also in physiological aging. This review presents and compares data on the morphological changes in the compact part of the substantia nigra of the human brain in physiological aging and Parkinson's disease.\n\u041f\u0440\u0438 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0430\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0444\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430. \u041a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u043f\u0442\u043e\u043c\u044b, \u0432\u044b\u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430 (\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u0433\u0438\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0438\u044f, \u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440), \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u043e \u0432\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441 \u043d\u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u0430 \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435 \u0433\u0438\u0431\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0444\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430. \u0412 \u0442\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044e \u044d\u0442\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0447\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043a \u043d\u0435\u0439\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u0430, \u0432\u044b\u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438. \u0412 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043e \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0444\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is associated with neurodegenerative conditions, may cause symptoms of end-organ hypoperfusion, increases fall risk, and can negatively impact quality of life. Droxidopa is approved for the treatment of symptomatic nOH in adults. As the largest subpopulation of patients with nOH has a diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD), the efficacy and tolerability of droxidopa in patients with PD and nOH were examined using integrated clinical trial data.\nPost hoc analyses included data from the phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of droxidopa (two short-term [1-2 weeks] trials and one medium-term [8-10 weeks] trial) in the subset of participants with PD and symptomatic nOH. Efficacy was assessed using standing blood pressure (BP) measurements and the Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ), a patient-reported evaluation of nOH symptoms (Orthostatic Hypotension Symptom Assessment [OHSA]), and their impact (Orthostatic Hypotension Daily Activity Scale [OHDAS]).\nThe analysis included 307 patients with PD (droxidopa, n\u2009=\u2009150; placebo, n\u2009=\u2009157). Compared with placebo, droxidopa significantly improved the OHQ composite score (\nThese post hoc analyses suggest that droxidopa provides meaningful clinical benefits and is well tolerated in the treatment of symptomatic nOH in patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a common and debilitating symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), and its etiology is likely multifactorial. One candidate mechanism is circadian disruption. Although there is evidence of circadian abnormalities in PD, no studies have directly assessed their association with cognitive impairment.\nInvestigate whether circadian rest-activity rhythm is associated with cognitive function in PD independently of sleep.\nThirty-five participants with PD wore wrist actigraph monitors and completed sleep diaries for 7 to 10 days, then underwent neuropsychological testing. Rest-activity rhythm was characterized using nonparametric circadian rhythm analysis of actigraphy data. Objective sleep parameters were also estimated using actigraphy data. Hierarchical regression models assessed the independent contributions of sleep and rest-activity rhythm to cognitive performance.\nLess stable day-to-day rest-activity rhythm was associated with poorer executive, visuospatial, and psychomotor functioning, but not with memory. Hierarchical regressions showed that interdaily stability's contribution to cognitive performance was independent of sleep's contributions. Whereas sleep contributed to executive function, but not psychomotor or visuospatial performance, rest-activity rhythm stability significantly contributed to variance in all three of these domains, uniquely accounting for 14.4% to 17.6% of their performance variance.\nOur findings indicate that circadian rest-activity rhythm is associated with cognitive impairment independently of sleep. This suggests the possible utility of rest-activity rhythm as a biomarker for circadian function in PD. Future research should explore interventions to stabilize behavioral rhythms in order to strengthen circadian function, which, in turn, may reduce cognitive impairment in PD.",

Whereas sleep contributed to executive function, but not psychomotor or visuospatial performance, rest-activity rhythm stability significantly contributed to variance in all three of these domains, uniquely accounting for 14.4% to 17.6% of their performance variance.",

    "abstract": "Clinicians vary in their ability to elicit and interpret hallucinatory symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). There is limited evidence for informant-report measures of PD hallucinations as adjuncts to clinician-rated scales.\nTo determine the utility of an informant version of the validated Psychosis and Hallucinations Questionnaire (PsycH-Q) for assessing the presence and severity of hallucinations in PD; and, to evaluate accuracy of clinician judgements by comparison with informant report and self-report.\nOne hundred sixty-three PD patient-informant dyads completed self- and informant-report versions of PsycH-Q and three common questionnaire measures: Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire; Parkinson's Psychosis Questionnaire; and Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease-Psychiatric Complications. We compared self-ratings and informant ratings across analogous subscales for the presence of hallucinations with clinician interview ratings on MDS-UPDRS as a diagnostic standard.\nThere was a low level of agreement between dyads (average \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.39; \u03ba range\u2009=\u20090.32-0.47; \nThe sole use of clinician-rated scales may underestimate prevalence of PD hallucinations, and there is room for introducing self- and informant-report tools. Nonetheless, clinician appraisals are critical in cases when informant and patient insight might be affected by the impact of illness on quality of life.",

A UPDRS III and 10\u2009m timed up and go (TUG) task were performed off medications-off DBS and then one hour after HFS and one hour after VFS programming.\nThe UPDRS III motor score improved by additional 14% during VFS setting when compared to HFS. VFS also increased gait speed (mean change 45%) and reduced the number of freezing episodes (mean change 58%).\nVFS improves UPDRS and FOG in PD when compared to HFS.Copyright \u00a9 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

Pramipexole ER showed a significant difference on the mean changes in LED and UPDRS-III score. After 13 weeks of initiating Pramipexole ER, the mean decrease in LED was -49.42 mg for all patients (p < 0.001, CI 95% [35.28-63.55]) and the mean decrease in UPDRS-III score for all patients was -6 points (P< 0.001).According to the subgroup analysis, patients aged 65 years and below, the change in mean total LED from baseline (350.80 mg) was a decrease of 63.19 mg with a p<0.001, CI 95% [42.07-84.31]. In patients aged more than 65 years and shifted to mono or combined pramipexole ER therapy, the change in mean total LED from baseline (559.25 mg) was a decrease of 34.67 mg with a p<0.001 CI 95% [16.16-53.18]. In addition the results showed that in patients having an UPDRS-III score of less than or equal to 33, the change in mean total LED from baseline (436.73 mg) was a decrease of 56.76 mg (p<0.001; CI 95% [41.32-72.20]). However, in patients having an UPDRS-III score of more than 33 the change in mean total LED from baseline (545.06 mg) was a decrease of 2.96 mg with a p value < 0.844 CI 95% [27.32-33.15].\nThis study demonstrated the efficacy of Pramipexole ER on decreasing the total levodopa equivalent dose (LED).The role of health care professionals is to maintain the patient on the lowest effective levodopa equivalent daily dose and optimize the treatment therapy, thus decreasing the side effects that might arise from overdosing of antiparkinsonian drugs.",

    "results": "A total of 176 patient's record was reviewed. Pramipexole ER showed a significant difference on the mean changes in LED and UPDRS-III score. After 13 weeks of initiating Pramipexole ER, the mean decrease in LED was -49.42 mg for all patients (p < 0.001, CI 95% [35.28-63.55]) and the mean decrease in UPDRS-III score for all patients was -6 points (P< 0.001).According to the subgroup analysis, patients aged 65 years and below, the change in mean total LED from baseline (350.80 mg) was a decrease of 63.19 mg with a p<0.001, CI 95% [42.07-84.31]. In patients aged more than 65 years and shifted to mono or combined pramipexole ER therapy, the change in mean total LED from baseline (559.25 mg) was a decrease of 34.67 mg with a p<0.001 CI 95% [16.16-53.18]. In addition the results showed that in patients having an UPDRS-III score of less than or equal to 33, the change in mean total LED from baseline (436.73 mg) was a decrease of 56.76 mg (p<0.001; CI 95% [41.32-72.20]). However, in patients having an UPDRS-III score of more than 33 the change in mean total LED from baseline (545.06 mg) was a decrease of 2.96 mg with a p value < 0.844 CI 95% [27.32-33.15].",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in adults over the age of 65. The characteristic symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as resting tremor, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability and gait imbalance, are thought to be a result of the progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra compacta, resulting in insufficient dopamine integrated signalling on GABAergic medium spiny neurons in the striatum. Despite tremendous research, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease have remained largely unknown. Although a variety of possible pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed over the years, including excessive release of oxygen free radicals, impairment of mitochondrial function, loss of trophic support, abnormal kinase activity, disruption of calcium homeostasis, dysfunction of protein degradation and neuroinflammation, the pathogenesis is still largely uncertain, and there is currently no effective cure for Parkinson's disease. To develop potential therapies for Parkinson's disease, inflammatory processes, mitochondrial dynamics, oxidative stress, production of reactive aldehydes, excitotoxicity and synucleinopathies are to be targeted. In this respect, vasoactive intestinal peptide has beneficial effects that provide an advantage for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Vasoactive intestinal peptide is a major neuropeptide-neurotransmitter having antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neurotropic, neuromodulator, and anti-apoptotic properties. In addition to its direct neuroprotective actions regulating the activity of astrocytes, microglia and brain mast cells, it also plays important roles for neuronal adaptation, maintenance and survival.",

    "abstract": "Clinical assessment of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) is subjective and may not reflect patient real-world experience. This two-part pilot study evaluated the accuracy of the NIMBLE wearable biosensor patch (containing an accelerometer and electromyography sensor) to record body movements in clinic and home environments versus clinical measurement of motor symptoms.\nPatients (Hoehn & Yahr 2-3) had motor symptom fluctuations and were on a stable levodopa dose. Part 1 investigated different sensor body locations (six patients). In Part 2, 21 patients wore four sensors (chest, and most affected side of shin, forearm and back-of-hand) during a 2-day clinic- and 1-day home-based evaluation. Patients underwent Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale assessments on days 1-2, and performed pre-defined motor activities at home on day 3. An algorithm estimated motor-symptom severity (predicted scores) using patch data (in-clinic); this was compared with in-clinic motor symptom assessments (observed scores).\nThe overall correlation coefficient between in-clinic observed and sensor algorithm-predicted scores was 0.471 (p\u202f=\u202f0.031). Predicted and observed scores were identical 45% of the time, with a predicted score within a \u00b11 range 91% of the time. Exact accuracy for each activity varied, ranging from 32% (pronation/supination) to 67% (rest-tremor-amplitude). Patients rated the patch easy-to-use and as providing valuable data for managing PD symptoms. Overall patch-adhesion success was 97.2%. The patch was safe and generally well tolerated.\nThis study showed a correlation between sensor algorithm-predicted and clinician-observed motor-symptom scores. Algorithm refinement using patient populations with greater symptom-severity range may potentially improve the correlation.",

    "abstract": "The Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WCQ) is used extensively in health research, but the measurement properties and suitability of the WCQ for people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have not been psychometrically assessed. If the WCQ does not align with its original 8-factor structure in a PD population, the use of the WCQ subscales may not be appropriate. The present study used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and multiple-group EFA to determine the ideal factor structure of the WCQ in a PD sample. The original 8 factors of the WCQ were not reproduced. EFA revealed a 6-factor structure, including Distancing, Faith, Avoidance, Seeking Social Support, Planful Problem Solving, and Confrontive coping. As motor symptom severity may impact coping, the stability of the 6-factor structure was examined across motor symptom severity (mild and moderate), remaining consistent. Higher levels of overall motor severity were associated with increased use of faith and avoidance style coping. These findings suggest that the 6-factor structure of the WCQ may be more appropriate for assessing coping styles in PD.",

    "abstract": "To determine the prevalence of osteoporosis (OP) and osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF) in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) in Korea and its association with socioeconomic status.\nUsing Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service-National Inpatient Sample (HIRA-NIS) data from 2009 to 2013, we estimated the annual prevalence of PD, OP, and OVF and investigated its association with socioeconomic status using data from National Health Insurance (NHI) beneficiaries and Medical Aid (MA) recipients. This study was supported by research funding from Korean Society for Bone and Mineral Research 2015. There were no study-specific biases related to conflicts of interest.\nThe number of PD patients in the HIRA-NIS increased each year from 2009 to 2013. Among patients with PD, the standardized prevalence rates of OP and OVF increased from 2009 to 2013; from 23.2 to 27.8 and from 2.8 to 4.2, respectively. Among patients with PD with OP, the prevalence of OVF were 12.2% and 15.1% in 2009 and 2013, respectively. The standardized prevalence rates of PD with OP and PD with OVF were significantly higher in MA recipients than in NHI beneficiaries.\nThe prevalence of PD both with OP and with OVF increased and the prevalence was higher in MA recipients than in NHI beneficiaries. These findings may suggest that age over 65 years, female and low income may be a significant factor related to PD occurring with OP and OVF.",

    "abstract": "The \u03b2-band oscillation in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a therapeutic target for Parkinson's disease. Previous studies demonstrated that l-DOPA decreases the \u03b2-band (13-30 Hz) oscillations with improvement of motor symptoms. However, it has not been elucidated whether patients with Parkinson's disease are able to control the \u03b2-band oscillation voluntarily. Here, we hypothesized that neurofeedback training to control the \u03b2-band power in the STN induces plastic changes in the STN of individuals with Parkinson's disease. We recorded the signals from STN deep-brain stimulation electrodes during operations to replace implantable pulse generators in eight human patients (3 male) with bilateral electrodes. Four patients were induced to decrease the \u03b2-band power during the feedback training (down-training condition), whereas the other patients were induced to increase (up-training condition). All patients were blinded to their assigned condition. Adjacent contacts that showed the highest \u03b2-band power were selected for the feedback. During the 10 min training, patients were shown a circle whose diameter was controlled by the \u03b2-band power of the selected contacts. Powers in the \u03b2-band during 5 min resting sessions recorded before and after the feedback were compared. In the down-training condition, the \u03b2-band power of the selected contacts decreased significantly after feedback in all four patients (",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the normal function(s) of the protein \u03b1-Synuclein (aSyn) has the potential to illuminate links between Parkinson's disease (PD) and diabetes and also point the way toward new therapies for these disorders. Here we provide a perspective for consideration based on our discovery that aSyn normally acts to inhibit insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2-cells by interacting with the Kir6.2 subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K-ATP). It is also known that K-ATP channels act to inhibit brain dopamine secretion, and we have also shown that aSyn is a normal inhibitor of dopamine synthesis. The finding, that aSyn modulates Kir6.2 and other proteins involved in dopamine and insulin secretion, suggests that aSyn interacting proteins may be negatively impacted when aSyn aggregates inside cells, whether in brain or pancreas. Furthermore, identifying therapies for PD that can counteract dysfunction found in diabetes, would be highly beneficial. One such compound may be the multiple sclerosis drug, FTY720, which like aSyn can stimulate the activity of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2Ac) as well as insulin secretion. In aging aSyn transgenic mice given long term oral FTY720, the mice had reduced aSyn pathology and increased levels of the protective molecule, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Vidal-Martinez et al., 2016). In collaboration with medicinal chemists, we made two non-immunosuppressive FTY720s that also enhance PP2Ac activity, and BDNF expression (Vargas-Medrano et al., 2014; Enoru et al., 2016; Segura-Ulate et al., 2017a). FTY720 and our novel FTY720-based-derivatives, may thus have therapeutic potential for both diabetes and PD.",

    "abstract": "Symptomatic control and improvement of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a key feature of the management of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ) and its short version, PDQ-8, validated disease-specific patient-reported instruments, have been highly recommended to use for assessing HRQoL in patients with PD. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the PDQ-8.\nEighty-three patients with PD were recruited for this methodological and cross-sectional study. The PDQ-8 was repeated to assess the test-retest reliability after one-week interval. The participants completed the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) as a generic HRQoL previously validated in Turkey. The Hoehn & Yahr stages of the patients were also determined. The SF-36 and Hoehn & Yahr stages were used to assess the convergent validity of the PDQ-8.\nThe Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.70-0.84, p<0.001) for PDQ-8. The test-retest reliability was very high as the intra-class correlation coefficient was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.93-0.99, p<0.001). The PDQ-8 had significant correlations with the physical and mental component scores of SF-36 (\u03c1=-0.52, p<0.001 and \u03c1=-0.64, p<0.001, respectively) and Hoehn & Yahr stages (\u03c1=0.56, p<0.001). There was no evidence of floor or ceiling effects.\nThe results of this study suggest that the Turkish version of the PDQ-8 is a reliable, valid, less time-consuming, and brief disease-specific instrument to assess HRQoL in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "For decades it has been speculated that Parkinson's Disease (PD) is associated with dysfunction of the vestibular system, especially given that postural instability is one of the major symptoms of the disorder. Nonetheless, clear evidence of such a connection has been slow to emerge. There are still relatively few studies of the vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VORs) in PD. However, substantial evidence of vestibulo-spinal reflex deficits, in the form of abnormal vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs), now exists. The evidence for abnormalities in the subjective visual vertical is less consistent. However, some studies suggest that the integration of visual and vestibular information may be abnormal in PD. In the last few years, a number of studies have been published which demonstrate that the neuropathology associated with PD, such as Lewy bodies, is present in the central vestibular system. Increasingly, stochastic or noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) is being investigated as a potential treatment for PD, and a number of studies have presented evidence in support of this idea. The aim of this review is to summarize and critically evaluate the human and animal evidence relating to the connection between the vestibular system and PD.",

    "abstract": "Our interdisciplinary mixed-methods exploratory study was aimed at gaining empirical data on the medical and nursing demands of residents who are in a late stage of Parkinson Disease (PD) and are cared for in residential homes in Salzburg (Austria). In earlier studies it has been concluded that symptom burden of late stage PD patients is similar to or even higher compared with oncological patients. However, although all nine residents who took part in our study had severe limitations in performing their daily activities and experienced enormous restrictions in their mobility, they were quite content with their present living situations and did not show significant symptom burden. From the ethnographic family interviews that we conducted the following features emerged: a strong closeness in the family, an improved quality of life when the patients lived in the nursing home and fears about the future. Therefore, we concluded that living in a nursing home that provides for the needs of these patients is the best option for PD patients in the final stages of their disease as well as for their relatives.",

    "abstract": "This literature review addressed wearable sensor systems to monitor motor symptoms in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) during activities of daily living (ADLs). Specifically, progress in monitoring tremor, freezing of gait, dyskinesia, bradykinesia, and hypokinesia was reviewed. Twenty-seven studies were found that met the criteria of measuring symptoms in a home or home-like setting, with some studies examining multiple motor disorders. Accelerometers, gyroscopes, and electromyography sensors were included, with some studies using more than one type of sensor. Five studies measured tremor, five studies examined bradykinesia or hypokinesia, thirteen studies included devices to measure dyskinesia or motor fluctuations, and ten studies measured akinesia or freezing of gait. Current sensor technology can detect the presence and severity of each of these symptoms; however, most systems require sensors on multiple body parts, which is challenging for remote or ecologically valid observation. Different symptoms are detected by different sensor placement, suggesting that the goal of detecting all symptoms with a reduced set of sensors may not be achievable. For the goal of monitoring motor symptoms during ADLs in a home setting, the measurement system should be simple to use, unobtrusive to the wearer and easy for an individual with PD to put on and take off. Machine learning algorithms such as neural networks appear to be the most promising way to detect symptoms using a small number of sensors. More work should be done validating the systems during unscripted and unconstrained ADLs rather than in scripted motions.",

    "abstract": "Kyung-Ok-Ko (KOK), a traditional multi-herbal medicine, has been widely used in Oriental medicine as a restorative that can enforce vitality of whole organs and as a medicine that can treat age-related symptoms including lack of vigor and weakened immunity. However, the beneficial effect of KOK on neurological diseases such as Parkinson's diseases (PD) is largely unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the protective effect of KOK on neurotoxicity in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. Pre-treatment with KOK at 1 or 2 g/kg/day (p.o.) showed significant mitigating effects on neurological dysfunction (motor and welfare) based on pole, rotarod, and nest building tests. It also showed effects on survival rate. These positive effects of KOK were related to inhibition of loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons, reduction of MitoSOX activity, increased apoptotic cells, microglia activation, and upregulation of inflammatory factors [interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide], and reduced blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and/or striatum after MPTP intoxication. Interestingly, these effects of KOK against MPTP neurotoxicity were associated with inhibition of phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways along with up-regulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathways in SNpc and/or striatum. Collectively, our findings suggest that KOK might be able to mitigate neurotoxicity in MPTP-induced mouse model of PD via multi-effects, including anti-neuronal and anti-BBB disruption activities through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. Therefore, KOK might have potential for preventing and/or treating PD.",

    "abstract": "Impulse control disorders (ICDs) are frequent behavioral complications of dopaminergic (DA) replacement therapies (DRTs) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Impulsive choice, which refers to an inability to tolerate delays to reinforcement, has been identified as a core pathophysiological process of ICDs. Although impulsive choices are exacerbated in PD patients with ICDs under DRTs, some clinical and preclinical studies suggest that the DA denervation of the dorsal striatum induced by the neurodegenerative process as well as a pre-existing high impulsivity trait, may both contribute to the emergence of ICDs in PD. We therefore investigated in a preclinical model in rats, specifically designed to study PD-related non-motor symptoms, the effect of nigrostriatal DA denervation on impulsive choice, in relation to pre-existing levels of impulsivity, measured in a Delay Discounting Task (DDT). In this procedure, rats had the choice between responding for a small sucrose reinforcer delivered immediately, or a larger sucrose reinforcer, delivered after a 0, 5, 10 or 15 s delay. In two different versions of the task, the preference for the large reinforcer decreased as the delay increased. However, and in contrast to our initial hypothesis, this discounting effect was neither exacerbated by, or related to, the extent of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) DA lesion, nor it was influenced by pre-existing variability in impulsive choice. These results therefore question the potential implication of the nigrostriatal DA system in impulsive choice, as well as the DA neurodegenerative process as a factor contributing significantly to the development of ICDs in PD.",

    "abstract": "When James Parkinson described the classical symptoms of the disease he could hardly foresee the evolution of our understanding over the next two hundred years. Nowadays, Parkinson's disease is considered a complex multifactorial disease in which genetic factors, either causative or susceptibility variants, unknown environmental cues, and the potential interaction of both could ultimately trigger the pathology. Noteworthy advances have been made in different fields from the clinical phenotype to the decoding of some potential neuropathological features, among which are the fields of genetics, drug discovery or biomaterials for drug delivery, which, though recent in origin, have evolved swiftly to become the basis of research into the disease today. In this review, we highlight some of the key advances in the field over the past two centuries and discuss the current challenges focusing on exciting new research developments likely to come in the next few years. Also, the importance of pre-motor symptoms and early diagnosis in the search for more effective therapeutic options is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) offers perhaps, the most promising route to a successful clinical intervention, and the use of an animal model exhibiting symptoms comparable to those observed in PD patients in the early stage of the disease, may facilitate screening of novel therapies for delaying the onset of more debilitating motor and behavioral abnormalities. In this study, a rat model of pre-motor PD was used to study the etiology of hyposmia, a non-motor symptom linked to the early stage of the disease when the motor symptoms have yet to be experienced. The study focussed on determining the effect of a partial reduction of both dopamine and noradrenaline levels on the olfactory cortex. Neuroinflammation and striking structural changes were observed in the model. These changes were prevented by treatment with a neuroprotective drug, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor agonist, exendin-4 (EX-4).",

    "abstract": "To compare the effect of simultaneous deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata (STN+SNr-DBS) to conventional subthalamic stimulation (STN-DBS) on sleep quality in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.\nThe study was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, cross-over clinical trial to compare the effect of STN-DBS vs. combined STN+SNr-DBS on subjective measures of sleep quality. Fifteen PD patients (2 female, age 62.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7 years) suffering from moderate idiopathic PD (disease duration: 12.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0 years, Hoehn & Yahr stage: 2.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 in the MED-ON & STN-DBS-ON condition, Hoehn & Yahr stage: 2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 in the MED-OFF condition preoperatively) participated in the study. Sleep quality was evaluated in both stimulation conditions using the PDSS-2 score as a self-rating questionnaire covering several aspects of sleep disturbances.\nPD patients showed mild-moderate sleep disturbances (STN-DBS: PDSS-2 score 17.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.0; STN+SNr-DBS: 14.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.5) with slight but not significant differences between both stimulation conditions. Considering the different subitems of the PDSS-2, combined STN+SNr stimulation was superior to conventional STN stimulation in improving restless legs symptoms (RLS) at night (STN-DBS\u00a0=\u00a01.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7 STN+SNr-DBS\u00a0=\u00a01.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8; W\u00a0=\u00a0-2.06, p\u00a0=\u00a00.039) and immobility at night (STN-DBS\u00a0=\u00a01.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4 STN+SNr-DBS\u00a0=\u00a00.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8; W\u00a0=\u00a0-2.041, p\u00a0=\u00a00.041).\nThis study demonstrates the safety of STN+SNr-DBS compared to conventional STN-DBS on sleep in general with potential beneficial input on RLS symptoms and akinesia at night.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurologic disorders, leading to progressive disability that can be slowed but not stopped by treatment. It is characterized by tremors, slow movements, stiffness in arms and legs, and balance impairment. Despite advancement in treatment, diagnosis, and care of PD patients, lack of adequate knowledge and associated beliefs among the community might have a key role in limiting access to proper treatment and care.\nTo identify the level of awareness of our population regarding PD in terms of causes, signs, symptoms, and treatment.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted on Saudis, who have active Twitter accounts. Data were collected through a previously validated questionnaire, which tests recognition of PD symptoms and general knowledge regarding PD. The questionnaire was translated into Arabic. Part 1 of the questionnaire is the demographic data collection sheet, Part 2 of the questionnaire tests recognition of PD symptoms, and Part 3 of the questionnaire tests general knowledge regarding PD.\nThe questionnaire was administered to 3,050 members of the public, of which 2,609 questionnaires (86.20%) were included in the analysis. The tremor was the most widely recognized symptom (86.10%), and weight loss was the most recognized non-motor symptom (24%). Most respondents (56%) were able to identify imbalance as a symptom of PD, whereas only 4.10% of them were able to identify the reduced sense of smell as a symptom of PD. Motor symptoms were significantly better recognized (range 31.30%-86.10%) than non-motor symptoms (range 4.10%-24%).\nEducational campaigns may be appropriate to improve public awareness of PD and individual knowledge about PD symptoms and treatment.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the current investigation was to examine a statistical approach to differentiating shorter silent intervals (e.g., stop gaps) from longer silent intervals (e.g., pause) at varying syntactic locations within a reading passage to better characterize articulatory and prosodic aspects of speech timing in Parkinson disease (PD). Silent intervals 15\u2009ms and longer were extracted from reading sample. Logarithmic transformation of the silent interval durations yielded a bimodal distribution. Gaussian Mixture Model analysis was used to statistically differentiate the first mode (Mode 1) that corresponded to short silent intervals from the second mode (Mode 2) that corresponded to longer silent intervals. The syntactic context surrounding each silent interval was also categorized. Results revealed that the large majority of silent intervals that occurred within a clause, phrase, or word were assigned to Mode 1, while the majority of silent intervals that coincided with sentence-ending punctuation were assigned to Mode 2. Results revealed that Mode 1 intervals were slightly, but significantly longer for speakers with PD (Mean\u2009=\u200952.48\u2009ms, SE\u2009=\u20093.23) compared to controls (Mean\u2009=\u200944.67\u2009ms, SE\u2009=\u20092.00). Examination of the surrounding syntactic context revealed that this difference occurred at between-word boundaries contained within a phrase or clause. No between group differences were observed for the other inter- and intra-sentence syntactic boundaries or Mode 2 intervals. This study outlines a data-based approach to differentiating short between- and within-word intervals from longer silent intervals or pauses that reflect the prosodic and syntactic structure of a reading passage. Using this approach, the current data suggest that speakers with PD exhibit longer short silent intervals than controls, potentially reflecting a slight delay in the fluent segment-to-segment transition between words.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is currently the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in the world. Major features of cell pathology of the disease include the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies, which are composed of aggregated proteins. The presence of Lewy's body is associated with more advanced stages of the disease when considering irreversible changes. Precise identification of the disease stage at a cellular level presents the critical tool in developing early diagnostics and/or prevention of PD. The aim of our work is to introduce sensitive microscopic analysis in living cells, focused on initial intracellular changes and thus capable to detect earlier stages of the disease.",

This study assessed the relationship between mobility domain of HRQoL measured by Parkinson's Disease Questionnaires-39 (PDQ-39) and clinical-demographic characteristics and developed a model predicting changes after rehabilitation.\nSubjects with Parkinson's disease underwent rehabilitation treatment and completed the following predictors: 10-m walking test (10MWT), Timed Up and Go (TUG), Berg Balance scale (BBS), Activities-specific Balance Confidence scales (ABC), Freezing of Gait (FOGQ) and PDQ-39. Two general linear models were calculated to predict the relationship between HRQoL at baseline and to predict HRQoL changes after rehabilitation.\nForty-two subjects (age 74.9\u2009\u00b1\u20097.3\u2009years, Hoehn&Yahr 2.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6) completed the baseline evaluation.

Changes in mobility domain of HRQoL (as assessed by PDQ-39) are likely to be greater in males, in people at higher stages of the disease and in people with more severe limitation in mobility domain of HRQoL (as assessed by PDQ-39) before rehabilitation. Results might be different when considering different outcomes or different measures for the same outcome (performance mobility test instead of self-report questionnaires).

We identified 102 unique studies referring to air pollution and PD, from which 15 were included in the meta-analyses. We applied random-effects models to combine risk estimates and investigated between studies heterogeneity. We assessed publication bias through plots and the Egger's test in cases of sufficient number of studies. We assessed associations accounting for multi-pollutant exposures and effect modification patterns by sex and smoking habits.\nWe identified 13 reports investigating associations of PD with long-term exposure to regulated air pollutants whilst two reported associations for short-term exposure to PM\nWe found weak evidence for an association between air pollution, mostly originating from traffic, and PD. Although meta-analysis increases power to detect small associations in rare outcomes, further research is needed to elaborate our suggestive associations. Such results are of public health significance since population aging in developed countries is expected to increase incidence of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, neurodegenerative disorder affecting over 137,000 people in the UK and an estimated five million people worldwide. Treatment typically involves long-term dopaminergic therapy, which improves motor symptoms, but is associated with dose-limiting side effects. Developing effective complementary, non-pharmacological interventions is of considerable importance. This paper presents the protocol for a three-arm pilot study to test the implementation of computer-based cognitive training that aims to produce improvements or maintenance of motor slower and motor fatigue symptoms in people with PD. The primary objective is to assess recruitment success and usability of external data capture devices during the intervention. The secondary objectives are to obtain estimates of variance and effect size for changes in primary and secondary outcome measures to inform sample size calculations and study design for a larger scale trial.\nThe study aims to recruit between 40 and 60 adults with early- to middle-stage PD (Hoehn and Yahr 1-3) from National Health Service (NHS) outpatients' clinics and support groups across North Wales, UK. Participants will be randomised to receive training over five sessions in either a spatial grid navigation task, a sequential subtraction task or a spatial memory task. Patient-centred outcome measures will include motor examination scores from part 3 of the UPDRS-III and data from movement kinematic and finger tapping tasks.\nThe results of this study will provide information regarding the feasibility of conducting a larger randomised control trial of non-pharmacological cognitive interventions of motor symptoms in PD.\nISRCTN, ISRCTN12565492.

    "abstract": "Contemporary publics actively engage with diverse forms of media when seeking health-related information. The hugely popular digital media platform YouTube has become one means by which people share their experiences of healthcare. In this paper, we examine amateur YouTube videos featuring people receiving Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. DBS has become a widely implemented treatment, and it is surrounded by high expectations that can create difficulty for clinicians, patients and their families. We examine how DBS, Parkinson's disease, and DBS recipients themselves, are delineated within these YouTube videos. The videos, we demonstrate, contain common compositional and stylistic elements that collectively represent DBS as a technological fix, and which accentuate the autonomy of the DBS recipient. The relational, interpersonal dimensions of chronic illness, and the complex impact of DBS on family dynamics, are elided. We therefore shed light on the means by which high expectations regarding DBS are sustained and circulated, and more generally, we illustrate how potentially powerful representations of medical technologies can emerge from the intersection of social media platforms, afflicted bodies and patient narratives.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) share many commonalities ranging from signaling deficits such as altered cholinergic activity, neurotrophin and insulin signaling to cell stress cascades that result in proteinopathy, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal cell death. These pathological processes are not unidirectional, but are intertwined, resulting in a series of feed-forward loops that worsen symptoms and advance disease progression. At the center of these loops is glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), a keystone protein involved in many of the multidirectional biological processes that contribute to AD and PD neuropathology. Here, a unified overview of the involvement of GSK-3 in the major processes involved in these diseases will be presented. The mechanisms by which these processes are linked will be discussed and the feed-forward pathways identified. In this regard, this review will put forth the notion that combination therapy, targeting these multiple facets of AD or PD neuropathology is a necessary next step in the search for effective therapies.",

    "abstract": "Studies have shown that rare variants of Mendelian genes for Parkinson's disease (PD) contribute to sporadic PD in the Caucasian population, which lacked confirmation in the Chinese population. Because the autosomal-dominant PD (AD-PD) had a phenotype closely resembling sporadic PD, we performed a systematic analysis of 7 AD-PD genes (SNCA, LRRK2, GIGYF2, VPS35, EIF4G1, DNAJC13, and CHCHD2) in 1456 Chinese sporadic PD patients and 1568 controls. Overall, 72 rare variants were identified, 7 of which were classified as likely pathogenic, 63 of which were categorized as of uncertain significance, and 2 of them were predicted to be likely benign. These AD-PD genes represented a clear enrichment of rare variants in PD patients from a burden analysis (p\u00a0= 0.003), and significant differences could still be observed when likely pathogenic variants were removed (p\u00a0= 0.027). The gene-based association testing also reached significance for LRRK2 (p\u00a0= 0.004) and remained statistically significant after the Bonferroni correction. This report suggested that rare variants of AD-PD genes had a role in the Chinese sporadic PD cohort, especially for those rare variants of LRRK2.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the top two common neurodegenerative diseases in elderly. Recent studies found the \u03b1-synuclein have a key role in AD. Although many clinical and pathological features between AD and PD are shared, the genetic association between them remains unclear, especially whether \u03b1-synuclein in PD genetically alters AD risk.\nWe did not obtain any significant result (OR\u2009=\u20090.918, 95% CI: 0.782-1.076, P\u2009=\u20090.291) in MR analysis between PD and AD risk. In MR between \u03b1-synuclein in PD with AD risk, we only extracted rs356182 as the IV through a strict screening process. The result indicated a significant association based on IVW method (OR\u2009=\u20090.638, 95% CI: 0.485-0.838, P\u2009=\u20091.20E-03). In order to examine the robustness of the IVW method, we used other three complementary analytical methods and also obtained consistent results.\nThe overall PD genetic risk factors did not predict AD risk, but the \u03b1-synuclein susceptibility genetic variants in PD reduce the AD risk. We believe that our findings may help to understand the association between them, which may be useful for future genetic studies for both diseases.",

    "abstract": "Although many experimental studies have shown the favorable effects of zonisamide on mitochondria using models of Parkinson's disease (PD), the influence of zonisamide on metabolism in PD patients remains unclear. To assess metabolic status under zonisamide treatment in PD, we performed a pilot study using a comprehensive metabolome analysis. Plasma samples were collected for at least one year from 30 patients with PD: 10 without zonisamide medication and 20 with zonisamide medication. We performed comprehensive metabolome analyses of plasma with capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We also measured disease severity using Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) staging and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor section, and analyzed blood chemistry. In PD with zonisamide treatment, 15 long-chain acylcarnitines (LCACs) tended to be increased, of which four (AC(12:0), AC(12:1)-1, AC(16:1), and AC(16:2)) showed statistical significance. Of these, two LCACs (AC(16:1) and AC(16:2)) were also identified by partial least squares analysis. There was no association of any LCAC with age, disease severity, levodopa daily dose, or levodopa equivalent dose. Because an upregulation of LCACs implies improvement of mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation, zonisamide might be beneficial for mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation, which is suppressed in PD.",

    "abstract": "Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and clinical trials of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 inhibitors are in development. The objective of this study was to evaluate phosphorylation of a new leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 substrate, Rab10, for potential use as a target engagement biomarker and/or patient enrichment biomarker for leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 inhibitor clinical trials.\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells and neutrophils were isolated from Parkinson's disease patients and matched controls, and treated ex vivo with a leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 inhibitor. Immunoblotting was used to measure levels of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 and Rab10 and their phosphorylation. Plasma inflammatory cytokines were measured by multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nMononuclear cells and neutrophils of both controls and Parkinson's disease patients responded the same to leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 inhibitor treatment. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 levels in mononuclear cells were the same in controls and Parkinson's disease patients, whereas leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 was significantly increased in Parkinson's disease neutrophils. Rab10 T73 phosphorylation levels were similar in controls and Parkinson's disease patients and did not correlate with leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 levels. Immune-cell levels of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 and Rab10 T73 phosphorylation were associated with plasma inflammatory cytokine levels.\nRab10 T73 phosphorylation appears to be a valid target engagement biomarker for potential use in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 inhibitor clinical trials. However, a lack of association between leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 and Rab10 phosphorylation complicates the potential use of Rab10 phosphorylation as a patient enrichment biomarker. Although replication is required, increased leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 levels in neutrophils from Parkinson's disease patients may have the potential for patient stratification. leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 activity in peripheral immune cells may contribute to an inflammatory phenotype. \u00a9 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Lewy body diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA), are associated with a wide range of nonmotor symptoms (NMS), including cognitive impairment, depression and anxiety, sleep disorders, gastrointestinal symptoms, and autonomic failure. The reason why such diverse and disabling NMS have not been weeded out but have persisted across evolution is unknown. As such, one possibility would be that the NMS might be somehow beneficial during development and/or reproductive stages, a possibility consistent with our recent view as to the evolvability of amyloidogenic proteins (APs) such as ",

    "abstract": "Hypokinetic dysarthria (HD) and freezing of gait (FOG) are both axial symptoms that occur in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). It is assumed they have some common pathophysiological mechanisms and therefore that speech disorders in PD can predict FOG deficits within the horizon of some years. The aim of this study is to employ a complex quantitative analysis of the phonation, articulation and prosody in PD patients in order to identify the relationship between HD and FOG, and establish a mathematical model that would predict FOG deficits using acoustic analysis at baseline. We enrolled 75 PD patients who were assessed by 6 clinical scales including the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG-Q). We subsequently extracted 19 acoustic measures quantifying speech disorders in the fields of phonation, articulation and prosody. To identify the relationship between HD and FOG, we performed a partial correlation analysis. Finally, based on the selected acoustic measures, we trained regression models to predict the change in FOG during a 2-year follow-up. We identified significant correlations between FOG-Q scores and the acoustic measures based on formant frequencies (quantifying the movement of the tongue and jaw) and speech rate. Using the regression models, we were able to predict a change in particular FOG-Q scores with an error of between 7.4 and 17.0 %. This study is suggesting that FOG in patients with PD is mainly linked to improper articulation, a disturbed speech rate and to intelligibility. We have also proved that the acoustic analysis of HD at the baseline can be used as a predictor of the FOG deficit during 2 years of follow-up. This knowledge enables researchers to introduce new cognitive systems that predict gait difficulties in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a typical neurodegenerative disease and the pathological feature of which is the death of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra region. At present, neuronal death caused by inflammatory cytokine-mediated neuroinflammation is being extensively studied. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is an inflammatory complex existing in microglia. Its activation promotes the secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2/18 (IL-1\u03b2/18) and induces pyroptosis, a type of cell death that possesses the potential for inflammation, to rupture microglia to further release IL-1\u03b2. In this review we focus on the mechanisms of activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis and their inflammatory effects on the development of PD. In addition, we focus on some inhibitors of NLRP3 inflammatory pathways to alleviate the progression of PD by inhibiting central inflammation and provide new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the swallowing in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) using comprehensive and multimodal methods.\nThe present study was conducted on 120 patients and 60 controls between January 2017 and January 2018. All participants' demographic data were recorded, and the swallowing of the subjects was evaluated by using several methods, including clinic, electrophysiologic, endoscopic and ultrasonographic procedure. First, the swallowing functions of the patient and control groups were compared. Subsequently, the patients were divided into two groups as patients with (n\u2009=\u200963) or without (n\u2009=\u200957) dysphagia symptoms according to their clinical evaluation. Finally, the data of these three groups were compared.\nIn comparison with healthy subjects, the swallowing evaluated by all diagnostic methods were affected in patients with PD. This effect was greater in patients with clinically symptomatic dysphagia. No difference was found between patients without dysphagia symptoms and healthy controls based on clinic, endoscopic and some electrophysiologic methods. Interestingly, thickness of all oral phase muscles in healthy controls were significantly higher than both dysphagic and non-dysphagic PD patients according to ultrasonography.\nAlthough it is widely known that dysphagia symptoms in patients with PD usually occur in advanced stages and cause serious problems for patients, the present study establishes that swallowing functions may have been affected in early stage patients without dysphagia symptoms. Assessment of swallowing functions is important and should be also assessed in patients without dysphagia symptoms. Moreover, ultrasonographic method may be used in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of literature has reported the effects of dual tasks on gait performance in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). The purpose of this meta-analysis was to synthesize the existing literature and quantify the overall influence of dual tasks on gait performance in PD. A thorough literature search was conducted, and 19 studies met the stringent inclusion criteria. Two moderator variable analyses examined the dual-task effect by: (a) mean single-task gait speed for each study (\u22651.1\u202fm/s or\u202f<\u202f1.1\u202fm/s), and (b) the type of dual task (arithmetic, language, memory, and motor). Three main findings were revealed by a random effects model analysis. First, a strong negative effect of dual tasks on walking performance (SMD\u202f=\u202f-0.68) confirmed that gait performance is adversely affected by dual tasks in people with PD. Second, the significant negative effect of dual tasks is present regardless of the mean level of single-task gait speed in a study. Third, dual-task walking speed deteriorates regardless of the type of dual task. Together, these results confirm that dual tasks severely affect walking performances in people with PD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the association of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene, additional SNP- SNP and gene- alcohol drinking interaction with Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to screen the best interaction combination among 4 SNPs within TLR4 gene and alcohol drinking. Logistic regression was performed to calculate the ORs (95%CI) for association between 4 SNPs within TLR4 gene, additional gene- alcohol drinking interaction and PD risk. PD risk was significantly higher for carriers with the rs7873784- G allele, or with the rs19279149- C allele of within TLR4 gene than those with wild genotypes, adjusted ORs (95%CI) were 0.72 (0.55-0.95) and 0.69 (0.51-0.95). However, we did not find any significant association of rs4986791 and rs11536889 with PD susceptibility after covariates adjustment for age, sex, smoking, alcohol drinking and BMI. GMDR analysis indicated a significant two-locus model (p\u202f=\u202f0.0010) involving rs1927914 and alcohol drinking, the cross-validation consistency of the two- locus models was 10/ 10, and the testing accuracy was 60.11%. In logistic regression analysis, we found that never alcohol- drinkers with rs1927914- TC or CC genotype within TLR4 gene have the lowest PD risk, compared to drinkers with rs1927914- TT genotype, OR (95%CI)\u202f=\u202f0.42 (0.28-0.61), after covariates adjustment. The rs7873784- G and rs19279149- C allele within TLR4 gene, interaction between rs1927914 and alcohol drinking were associated with decreased PD risk.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease-associated mutations within the GTPase domain Ras of complex proteins (ROC) of leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) result in an abnormal over-activation of its kinase domain. However, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Recent study has shown that LRRK2 G-domain cycles between monomeric and dimeric conformations upon binding to GTP or guanosine diphosphate, and that the Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated R1441C/G/H mutations impair the G-domain monomer-dimer dynamics and trap the G-domain in a constitutive monomeric conformation. That led us to question whether other disease-associated mutations in G-domain would also affect its conformation. Here, we report that another PD-associated N1437H mutation also impairs its monomer-dimer conformational dynamics and GTPase activity. In contrast with mutations at R1441, ROC",

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease suffer from gait disturbances, such as a shuffling and festinating gait, which reduces their quality of life. To circumvent this problem, external visual cues may be applied in gait training to maintain the integrity of motor function. However, conventional training methods, such as transverse lines stuck on the ground, are difficult to adjust and adapt to personalized gait ability. This study proposes a convenient instrumented wheel walker that provides gap adjustable visual cues and selectable projection modes onto the ground with and without motion relative to the user. Ten subjects with Parkinson's disease were recruited, and the efficacy of the proposed device for their gait training was assessed. We demonstrated the applicability of our device to address personalized demands in gait guidance. With a personalized setting for patients with Parkinson's disease, a significantly lengthened stride length may be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are neurodegenerative disorders of the aging population characterized by the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn). The mechanisms triggering \u03b1-syn toxicity are not completely understood, however, c-terminus truncation of \u03b1-syn by proteases such as calpain may have a role. Therefore, inhibition of calpain may be of value. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of systemically administered novel low molecular weight calpain inhibitors on \u03b1-syn pathology in a transgenic mouse model. For this purpose, non-tg and \u03b1-syn tg mice received the calpain inhibitors - Gabadur, Neurodur or a\u00a0vehicle, twice a day for 30 days. Immunocytochemical analysis showed a 60% reduction in \u03b1-syn deposition using Gabadur and a 40% reduction using Neurodur with a concomitant reduction in c-terminus \u03b1-syn and improvements in neurodegeneration. Western blot analysis showed a 77% decrease in \u03b1-spectrin breakdown products (SBDPs) SBDPs with Gabadur and 63% reduction using Neurodur. There was a 65% reduction in the active calpain form with Gabadur and a\u00a045% reduction with Neurodur. Moreover, treatment with calpain inhibitors improved activity performance of the \u03b1-syn tg mice. Taken together, this study suggests that calpain inhibition might be considered in the treatment of synucleinopathies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bim has been reported to be involved in dopaminergic neurodegeneration of experimental PD. However, an in situ expression profile of Bim in PD has not been performed, and the cell types of which Bim accounts for PD pathogenesis is unclear. Here, we report with in situ observations that Bim is transcriptionally induced in the dopaminergic neurons of the SNpc in 1-methyl-4-pheny-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice. To investigate the precise role of Bim in the dopaminergic neurons in parkinsonian neuronal death, we obtained dopaminergic neuron-specific Bim null (Bim",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the potential differences in changes to cerebellar grey matter volume (GMV) and functional connectivity (FC) and the association between them, which might elucidate cerebellar function in multiple system atrophy (MSA) and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD).\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and three-dimensional T1 scans were obtained from 38 IPD, 62 MSA, and 59 healthy controls (HC). Seed-based connectivity analysis and voxel-based morphometry analysis were performed to assess the changes of cerebellar FC and GMV between the patient groups.\nDecreased cerebellar GMV was found in the motor cerebellum in both patient groups relative to HC, and broader reduction of GMV was observed in both cognitive and motor cerebellum in MSA compared with IPD and HC. Compared with IPD, the MSA group exhibited decreased FC between bilateral dentate nucleus (DN) and default mode network (DMN). Decreased intracerebellar FC was observed in both patient groups relative to HC. Cerebellar GMV was positively correlated with FC of intracerebellum and DN-DMN in MSA. Motor/cognitive scores were associated with DN-DMN FC, with considerable cerebellar GMV loss in MSA patients.\nCerebellar GMV loss and cerebellar FC alterations showed similarities in IPD and MSA, along with more widespread changes to GMV in motor and cognitive cerebellum and altered DN-DMN FC in MSA. Further research is needed to better describe the alterations of cerebellar GMV in the cognitive cerebellum and association between cerebellar GMV and intracerebellar FC during the early stages of MSA and IPD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive, disabling neurodegenerative disorder associated with significant economic burden for patients and caregivers. The objective of this study was to compare the direct and indirect economic burden of Parkinson's patients' caregivers with demographically matched controls in the United States, in the 5 years after first diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.\nPolicyholders (18-64 years old) linked to a Parkinson's disease patient (\u22652 diagnoses of Parkinson's disease; first diagnosis is the index date) from January 1, 1998 to March 31, 2014, were selected from a private-insurer claims database and categorized as Parkinson's caregivers. Eligible Parkinson's caregivers were matched 1:5 to policyholders with a non-Parkinson's dependent (controls). Multivariable regression adjusted for baseline characteristics estimated direct costs (all-cause insurer cost [medical and prescription] and comorbidity-related medical costs; patient out-of-pocket costs) and indirect costs (disability and medically related absenteeism costs). Income progression was also compared between cohorts.\nA total of 1211 eligible Parkinson's caregivers (mean age, 56 years; 54% female) were matched to 6055 controls. In adjusted analyses, Parkinson's caregivers incurred significantly higher year 1 total all-cause insurer costs ($8999 vs $7117) and medical costs ($7081 vs $5568) (both P < 0.01) and higher prescription costs (range for years 1-5, $2506-2573 vs $1405-$1687) and total out-of-pocket costs ($1259-1585 vs $902-$1192) in years 1-5 (all P < 0.01). Parkinson's caregivers had significantly higher adjusted indirect costs in years 1-3 (range for years 1-3, $2054-$2464 vs $1681-$1857; all P < 0.05) and higher cumulative income loss over 5 years ($5967 vs $2634 by year 5; P for interaction = 0.03).\nParkinson's caregivers exhibited higher direct and indirect costs and greater income loss compared with matched controls. \u00a9 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society \u00a9 2018 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) are often treated with an atypical antipsychotic, especially quetiapine or clozapine, but side effects, lack of sufficient efficacy, or both may motivate a switch to pimavanserin, the first medication approved for management of PDP. How best to implement a switch to pimavanserin has not been clear, as there are no controlled trials or case series in the literature to provide guidance. An abrupt switch may interrupt partially effective treatment or potentially trigger rebound effects from antipsychotic withdrawal, whereas cross-taper involves potential drug interactions. A panel of experts drew from published data, their experience treating PDP, lessons from switching antipsychotic drugs in other populations, and the pharmacology of the relevant drugs, to establish consensus recommendations. The panel concluded that patients with PDP can be safely and effectively switched from atypical antipsychotics used off label in PDP to the recently approved pimavanserin by considering each agent's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, receptor interactions, and the clinical reason for switching (efficacy or adverse events). Final recommendations are that such a switch should aim to maintain adequate 5-HT2A antagonism during the switch, thus providing a stable transition so that efficacy is maintained. Specifically, the consensus recommendation is to add pimavanserin at the full recommended daily dose (34 mg) for 2-6 weeks in most patients before beginning to taper and discontinue quetiapine or clozapine over several days to weeks. Further details are provided for this recommendation, as well as for special clinical circumstances where switching may need to proceed more rapidly.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) occurs commonly and can comprise the most troubling symptoms among the many that occur with this illness. Prior treatment options for PDP have been limited and unsatisfactory due to uneven efficacy data, burdensome monitoring, and lack of a specific FDA indication coupled with warnings of increased mortality. Pimavanserin, approved for the treatment of PDP by the FDA in 2016, overcomes some of these obstacles, with data proven efficacy and without the frequent monitoring required for clozapine. This presents an opportunity to transition patients with PDP to pimavanserin from older therapies. Black and colleagues provide their thoughtful recommendations on how to achieve this transition to pimavanserin while maintaining symptom control and minimizing disruptions that might occur with a medication change.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is frequently associated with olfactory disorder at early stage, which is caused by deposition of Lewy bodies emerging from the olfactory bulb to higher olfactory centers. Early detection of olfactory disorder in the patients with PD may lead to the early diagnosis and treatment for this refractory disease.\nVisual analog scale (VAS), Jet Stream Olfactometry, and Japanese smell identification test, Open Essence (OE), were carried out on 39 patients with PD. Thirty-one patients with postviral olfactory disorder (PVOD), which was caused by the olfactory mucosal dysfunction, were also enrolled in this study as control.\nThere were no significant differences in detection thresholds (2.2 vs. 1.4, P=0.13), recognition thresholds (3.9 vs. 3.5, P=0.39) and OE (4.8 vs. 4.2, P=0.47) between PVOD and PD, while VAS scores of PVOD and PD were significantly different (2.0 and 6.2, P<0.01). In OE, significant differences were observed in the accuracy rates of menthol (68% vs. 44%, P=0.04) and Indian ink (42% vs. 15%, P=0.01) between PVOD and PD. Of particular interest, patients with PVOD tended to select \"no detectable,\" while patients with PD tended to select wrong alternative other than \"no smell detected.\"\nDiscrepancy between VAS and OE, and high selected rates of wrong alternative other than \"undetectable\" in OE might be significant signs of olfactory dysfunction associated with PD.",

    "abstract": "Oral administration of hydrogen water ameliorates Parkinson's disease (PD) in rats, mice, and humans. We previously reported that the number of putative hydrogen-producing bacteria in intestinal microbiota is low in PD compared to controls. We also reported that the amount of hydrogen produced by ingestion of lactulose is low in PD patients. The decreased hydrogen production by intestinal microbiota may be associated with the development and progression of PD. We measured the amount of hydrogen production using gas chromatography by seven bacterial strains, which represented seven major intestinal bacterial groups/genera/species. Blautia coccoides and Clostridium leptum produced the largest amount of hydrogen. Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis constituted the second group that produced hydrogen 34- to 93-fold lower than B. coccoides. Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Atopobium parvulum constituted the third group that produced hydrogen 559- to 2164-fold lower than B. coccoides. Lactobacillus casei produced no detectable hydrogen. Assuming that taxonomically neighboring strains have similar hydrogen production, we simulated hydrogen production using intestinal microbiota that we previously reported, and found that PD patients produce a 2.2-fold lower amount of intestinal hydrogen compared to controls. The lower amount of intestinal hydrogen production in PD was also simulated in cohorts of two other countries. The number of hydrogen-producing intestinal bacteria may be associated with the development and progression of PD. Further studies are required to prove its beneficial effect.",

    "abstract": "To study the clinical heterogeneity of fatigue syndrome and evaluate the efficacy of cytoflavin as an addition to standard treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nOne hundred patients with Parkinson's disease and fatigue took part in the study, 59 patients continued to participate in the study including 59.3% (32) women and 40.7% (27) men. All patients received standard treatment. The equivalent daily dose of levodopa (LEDD) was 736.9\u00b1419.1 mg/day. The average age of patients was 67\u00b18.6 (from 65 to 85 years). Cytoflavin was used as an additional therapy in the standard dosage. All patients underwent neuropsychological examination for an estimate of the rate of fatigue, depression, health status, activity, mood and quality of life.\nCytoflavin is well tolerated by patients with Parkinson's disease and fatigue syndrome at the standard dosage. It improves the health, mood, quality of life and reduces fatigue.\n\u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f.

Along with pathological haemodynamic features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an easily-inducible re-entrant tachycardia was clearly documented in our patient. Given the fatal potential of supraventricular tachycardia in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, we postulated that his tachyarrhythmia could potentially trigger the event. Upon his refusal to receive implantable cardioverter/defibrillator therapy, we ablated anatomical arrhythmogenic substrate instead, and he remained uneventfully over 3 years on \u03b2-blocker.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that Fluoxetine (FLX), an anti-depressant drug, has broad neurobiological functions and neuroprotective effects in central nervous system injury, but its roles in Parkinson's disease (PD) remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether fluoxetine attenuates rotenone-induced neurodegeneration in PD.\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to control, rotenone-treated, rotenone + FLX-treated and FLX-treated groups. Behavioral tests including open field behavioral test and catalepsy measurement were taken to evaluate neurological behavioral measurements. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related gene expressions were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess dopaminergic neuronal degeneration.\nWe demonstrated that pretreatment with FLX (10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly ameliorated the catalepsy symptom and increased locomotor activity. In addition, FLX markedly reversed the loss of dopaminergic neurons and suppressed the X\u2011box\u2011binding protein 1 (XBP1)/caspase-3-activated ER stress. Furthermore, FLX inhibited rotenone-mediated neurodegeneration through caspase-3-mediated neuronal apoptosis.\nTaken together, our findings indicate that FLX has beneficial neuroprotective effects in PD and FLX might be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of PD. In light of its favorable properties, FLX should be evaluated in the treatment of PD as well as related neurologic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Current best medical treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) involves a medical professional who applies state-of-the-art knowledge of diagnostics and treatment- as derived from cohort studies and clinical trials- to the healthcare process of individual patients. Thus, the much-needed personalization of medicine depends on the abilities, experience and intuition of medical professionals to adjust group-based knowledge to individual decision making. Within 20 years from now, such personal clinical decisions will be largely supported by digital means, also defining a new ecosystem of healthcare often referred to as \"digital medicine\". We expect that the next phase of digitalization will include new \"digital health pathways\": data-driven personalized decision support that is based on a combination of multimodal data sources, including evidence-based medical knowledge (e.g., clinical guidelines), personal disease profiles (including genetic determinants of disease progression and treatment response), insights into individual disease trajectories (thereby defining subgroups of patients) and individual patients' needs. Here, we illustrate the potential of this development by sketching the contours of a digitally supported care pathway for gait disability and falls. Such digital health pathways will support the introduction of personalized medicine for PD patients, allowing patients to benefit optimally from individually tailored treatments. This should result in a better quality of life for patients and lower costs for society.",

    "abstract": "Given the rapidly increasing number of reported movement disorder genes and clinical-genetic desciptions of mutation carriers, the International Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorder Society Gene Database (MDSGene) initiative has been launched in 2016 and grown to become a large international project (http://www.mdsgene.org). MDSGene currently contains >1150 variants described in \u223c5700 movement disorder patients in almost 1000 publications including monogenic forms of PD clinically resembling idiopathic (PARK-PINK1, PARK-Parkin, PARK-DJ-1, PARK-SNCA, PARK-VPS35, PARK-LRRK2), as well as of atypical PD (PARK-SYNJ1, PARK-DNAJC6, PARK-ATP13A2, PARK-FBXO7). Inclusion of genes is based on standardized published criteria for determining causation. Clinical and genetic information can be filtered according to demographic, clinical or genetic criteria and summary statistics are automatically generated by the MDSGene online tool. Despite MDSGene's novel approach and features, it also faces several challenges: i) The criteria for designating genes as causative will require further refinement, as well as time and support to replace the faulty list of 'PARKs'. ii) MDSGene has uncovered extensive clinical data gaps. iii) The quickly growing body of clinical and genetic data require a large number of experts worldwide posing logistic challenges. iv) MDSGene currently captures published data only, i.e., a small fraction of the available information on monogenic PD available. Thus, an important future aim is to extend MDSGene to unpublished cases in order to provide the broad data base to the PD community that is necessary to comprehensively inform genetic counseling, therapeutic approaches and clinical trials, as well as basic and clinical research studies in monogenic PD.",

    "abstract": "Care of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will dramatically change in the upcoming years. The nationwide implementations of the patient-controlled electronic health record (EHR) and the technology-based home monitoring system will most probably be the cornerstones of this revolution. We speculate that, within the course of the next decade, EHRs will lead to a substantial empowerment of patients, and monitoring of motor and non-motor manifestations of PD will shift from the clinic to the home. As far as this can be foreseen, small, partly clothing-embedded and implanted sensor systems allowing passive (i.e., non-obtrusive) data collection will dominate the market. They will interoperate with the personal EHR and other potentially health-related electronic databases such as clinical warehouses and population health analytics platforms. Analysis software will be mainly built on artificial intelligence, and presentation of data will be intuitive. This scenario will eventually help both the patient and the medical professional by providing higher amounts of quality information about daily-relevant effects of disease and treatment, eventually allowing for a better and more personalized care.",

    "abstract": "It is widely believed that environmental exposures contribute to the vast majority of late-onset sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), alone or via interactions with genetic factors. The search for environmental causes of PD has however been hampered by lack of understanding the prodromal phase of PD development and the difficulties in exposure assessment during this prolonged period. On the other hand, the existence of this prodromal period, along with an increasingly better understanding of PD prodromal symptoms, provides an exciting opportunity to identify environmental factors that initiate PD pathogenesis and/or modify its progression. For prevention efforts, this prodromal stage is of a major interest. Targeting factors that enter the body via the nose or gut has become even more important since the discovery of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in the enteric and olfactory nervous systems. In this paper, we speculate about novel research hypotheses and approaches that may help us better define the role of environment in PD etiology, especially during its extended and complex prodromal\u00a0phase.",

    "abstract": "Exercise is increasingly recognized as an important element in the treatment of Parkinson's disease but what is exercise targeting? What accounts for the benefits observed in Parkinson's disease? Is exercise disease modifying? Several modes of exercise have been studied in various doses across a heterogeneous Parkinson's population. Yet more clarity is needed as to who benefits most and when, from what type of exercise and at which intensity. In this paper, we briefly review the state of the art in key areas and speculate on the likely state of research in each area in the next 20 years. Key areas relate to: (1) the physiological benefits of exercise with respect to disease modification; (2) the best type of exercise; (3) the optimal intensity of exercise; and (4) implementation strategies to increase exercise uptake. A better understanding of these concepts would allow for a more effective, personalized approach, rather than the current \"one size fits all\" and could most likely confer greater benefits.",

We argue that for both clinical care and therapeutic development, these definitions need updating for the molecular age in which we live. We highlight specific instances in which genetic or biochemical biomarkers are increasingly used for clinical trial enrollment in the neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that molecular definition(s) of PD are already emerging. We review candidate biomarkers for PD-related pathologies and highlight the need for further validation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with distinct abnormalities in brain function and structure. Here we discuss how future developments in functional, structural and nuclear brain imaging may help us to better understand, diagnose, and potentially even treat PD. These new horizons may be reached by developing tracers that specifically bind to alpha synuclein, by looking into different places in the body (such as the gut) or in smaller cerebral nuclei (with improved spatial resolution), and by developing new approaches for quantifying and interpreting altered dynamics in large-scale brain networks.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of PD pathophysiology is vastly improved compared to the situation 20 years ago. We have identified the major genetic risks for PD, we now have far more representative animal models of the disease, and we can be inspired by the early successes of others using Antisense Oligonucleotide and vaccination approaches in other neurodegenerative diseases. We also have a broad range of repurposed drugs showing the first signals of potential efficacy in the translational pipeline which are being driven forward through the various clinical trial stages. We believe we can be optimistic that the next 20 years will be a time for major breakthroughs towards the discovery of therapies that may slow, stop, or reverse PD.",

    "abstract": "In the last two decades it has become clear that Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a plethora of gastrointestinal symptoms originating from functional and structural changes in the gut and its associated neural structures. This is of particular interest not only because such symptoms have a major impact on the quality of life of PD patients, but also since accumulating evidence suggests that in at least a subgroup of patients, these disturbances precede the motor symptoms and diagnosis of PD by years and may thus give important insights into the origin and pathogenesis of the disease. In this mini-review we attempt to concisely summarize the current knowledge after two decades of research on the gut-brain axis in PD. We focus on alpha-synuclein pathology, biomarkers, and the gut microbiota and envision the development and impact of these research areas for the two decades to come.",

    "abstract": "Continuous dopaminergic stimulation in Parkinson's disease (PD) has several advantages over pulsatile, non-continuous, stimulation. These therapies currently consist of pump-based and transcutaneous therapies and are based on a more constant delivery of the dopaminergic drug resulting in continuous dopaminergic stimulation and a more stable treatment effect. Several clinical and experimental observations have shown that continuous stimulation of dopaminergic receptors induces fewer complications, such as dyskinesia, compared to pulsatile stimulation. Currently available non-oral pharmacological continuous therapies in PD include the transdermal Rotigotine (RTG) patch, infusion therapies with Apomorphine and Intrajejunal Levodopa (IJLI) and the Rivastigmine patch. Here we aim to provide a concise review of these current therapies and discuss ongoing and future developments of continuous non-oral pharmacological dopaminergic therapies in PD.",

    "abstract": "Neurological disorders are now the leading source of disability globally, and the fastest growing neurological disorder in the world is Parkinson disease. From 1990 to 2015, the number of people with Parkinson disease doubled to over 6 million. Driven principally by aging, this number is projected to double again to over 12 million by 2040. Additional factors, including increasing longevity, declining smoking rates, and increasing industrialization, could raise the burden to over 17 million. For most of human history, Parkinson has been a rare disorder. However, demography and the by-products of industrialization have now created a Parkinson pandemic that will require heightened activism, focused planning, and novel approaches.",

    "abstract": "Today, meta-analyses demonstrate that cognitive training is safe and effective to enhance vulnerable cognitive functions in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), so that cognitive interventions can be regarded as a promising approach to treat or even prevent cognitive dysfunction in PD. However, many research gaps exist. Thus, this article aims to identify relevant research topics with regard to cognitive interventions in PD patients for the next 20 years. The most important to do's include the development of (non-digital and digital, maybe also artificial intelligence based) standardized cognitive interventions for PD patients in different cognitive stages and the conduct of large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in these groups, also considering different patient profiles (e.g., motor subtypes) and the living setting (inpatient versus outpatient). The impact of cognitive and combined interventions in individuals with prodromal PD is of high relevance. Studies should elucidate underlying mechanisms of cognitive and neural plasticity induced by cognitive interventions and propose prediction models on which patients profit from which intervention. Health-economic analyses are also urgently needed. More generally, increasing the awareness of the concept of cognitive reserve and possibilities for the prevention of cognitive dysfunction is an important goal.",

    "abstract": "The surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease has made significant progress over the past 70 years; however, its scope of effectiveness remains limited to motor symptoms like bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor and medication-induced dyskinesias. The field of surgery initially developed from lesioning procedures and then transitioned largely to deep brain stimulation due to its properties of adaptability and reversibility. Interestingly, there has been a renewed interest in lesioning procedures secondary to the introduction of focused ultrasound, a non-invasive technology. Despite the various current therapies' effectiveness, there is a significant need for developing treatments to modify the disease process itself. To date, gene therapy, immunotherapy, and cell transplantation trials have had both promising and disappointing results. Newer techniques being developed (optogenetics, magnetogenetics, and sonogenetics) are exciting possibilities for the future. Here, we examine and speculate on novel potential surgical treatments for Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease has been considered for practical purposes a heterogeneous clinico-pathological entity. The operational definition requires clinical ascertainment of a levodopa-responsive parkinsonism with no \"atypical\" features, and pathological criteria based on the finding, usually at postmortem, of aggregates of \u03b1-synuclein in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. The underlying assumption has been that a molecular-biological disorder, targetable for disease modification as a whole, underlies this clinico-pathologic, convergent model of disease. The 2020s will be expected to mark the beginning of the end for this model, especially if therapeutic success in a specific molecular subtype, such as PD-GBA, is not translated to \"sporadic PD\". The complex and dynamic biological abnormalities of aging, which have informed the evolution of other fields in medicine into divergent, systems-biology models, will also provide the template for the development of disease modifying therapies for neurodegenerative disorders. In the 2020s and 2030s we will no longer ask whether any given molecule may be neuroprotective in early Parkinson disease but, rather, which subtype (which endophenotype) among the Parkinson diseases would be the best mechanistic recipient for such molecule and which would not. The next breakthrough in Parkinson's research will be conceptual: the recognition that discoveries in a subtype of PD will apply only or largely to that subtype and not construed to represent \"a piece\" that seamlessly inserts into, and helps explains, a unifying \"Parkinson's puzzle\". Successful neuroprotection for each PD subtype will likely require pharmacotherapeutic combinations (\"drug cocktails\") to harness synergistic potential benefits when more than the dominant pathogenic mechanism is targeted, as identified from forthcoming population-based unbiased biomarker discovery programs.",

    "abstract": "Non-pharmacological interventions are essential in the management of gait impairments in Parkinson's disease. The evidence for these interventions is growing rapidly. However, studies evaluating these interventions do generally evaluate a one-size-fits-all concept, and do usually not distinguish between subgroups, treatment dose and delivery mode. For two main reasons, this approach will not reach the full potential of gait rehabilitation. First, non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., external cueing) can improve gait in certain patients, but have no effect or sometimes even exacerbate gait deficits in others. Second, the success and benefit of gait rehabilitation relies on therapy adherence and training intensity achieved, and multi-target therapy not tailored to the individual runs the risk of hitting nothing. Hence, to apply non-pharmacological interventions in an individualized and evidence-based manner, clinicians and therapists need to know which patient characteristics predict the efficacy of various training modes and what type of training delivery works best. Current evidence is not sufficient to develop such personalized rehabilitation programs. In this viewpoint, however, we describe how tailored use of gait rehabilitation can be reached within a 20-year time frame.",

    "abstract": "The field of prodromal PD is still in its infancy, and at the cusp of major advances. This article summarizes where we are, and most importantly where we need to go in order for the promise of prodromal PD to be realized. In the immediate future, the criteria need to be updated with additional markers and disseminated broadly. In the near future, they need to better incorporate changes in likelihood ratio with age and sex, combine markers in novel ways using big data approaches, identify subtypes, and incorporate better higher-specificity markers as they are discovered. Integration of smartphone/wearable markers and biomarkers of progression from the prodromal phase will allow development of neuroprotective trials in early stages. By 2040, it is hoped that prodromal criteria will be incorporated into active neuroprotective treatment programs, allowing a program of population-based screening followed by early treatment and ultimately the prevention of clinical PD from ever becoming manifest.",

    "abstract": "Akinesia is a major manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD) related to difficulties or failures of willed movement to occur. Akinesia is still poorly understood and is not fully alleviated by standard therapeutic strategies. One reason is that the area of the clinical concept has blurred boundaries referring to confounded motor symptoms. Here, we review neuroimaging studies which, by providing access to finer-grained mechanisms, have the potential to reveal the dysfunctional brain processes that account for akinesia. It comes out that no clear common denominator could be identified across studies that are too heterogeneous with respect to the clinical/theoretical concepts and methods used. Results reveal, however, that various abnormalities within but also outside the motor and dopaminergic pathways might be associated with akinesia in PD patients. Notably, numerous yet poorly reproducible neural correlates were found in different brain regions supporting executive control by means of resting-state or task-based studies. This includes for instance the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the inferior frontal cortex, the supplementary motor area, the medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex or the precuneus. This observation raises the issue of the multidimensional nature of akinesia. Yet, other open issues should be considered conjointly to drive future investigations. Above all, a unified terminology is needed to allow appropriate association of behavioral symptoms with brain mechanisms across studies. We adhere to a use of the term akinesia restricted to dysfunctions of movement initiation, ranging from delayed response to freezing or even total abolition of movement. We also call for targeting more specific neural mechanisms of movement preparation and action triggering with more sophisticated behavioral designs/event-related neurofunctional analyses. More work is needed to provide reliable evidence, but answering these still open issues might open up new prospects, beyond dopaminergic therapy, for managing this disabling symptom.",

    "abstract": "Feature representation is the crucial factor for the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of Parkinson's disease (PD). Deep polynomial network (DPN) is a novel supervised deep learning algorithm, which has excellent feature representation for small dataset. In this work, a stacked DPN (SDPN) based ensemble learning framework is proposed for diagnosis of PD, which can improve diagnostic accuracy for small dataset. In the proposed framework, SDPN was performed on each subset of extracted features from MRI images to generate new feature representation. The support vector machine (SVM) was then adopted to perform classification task on each subset. The ensemble learning algorithm was then performed on all the SVM classifiers to generate the final diagnosis for PD. The experimental results on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset (PPMI) showed that the proposed algorithm achieved the classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 90.15%, 85.48% and 93.27%, respectively, with the brain network features, and it also got the classification accuracy of 87.18%, sensitivity of 86.90% and specificity of 87.27% on the multi-view features extracted from different brain regions. Moreover, the proposed algorithm outperformed other algorithms on the MRI dataset from PPMI. It suggests that the proposed SDPN-based ensemble learning framework has the feasibility and effectiveness for the CAD of PD.\n\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u8fbe\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6210\u50cf\uff08MRI\uff09\u7684\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\uff08PD\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DPN\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411 PD \u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u6808\u5f0f DPN\uff08SDPN\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u7684 PD \u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6240\u63d0\u53d6\u7684 MRI \u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\u5206\u522b\u901a\u8fc7 SDPN \u5f97\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff08SVM\uff09\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u518d\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7684 PD \u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u5e93 PPMI \u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8111\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5206\u522b\u4e3a 90.15%\u300185.48% \u548c 93.27%\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8111\u533a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5206\u522b\u4e3a 87.18%\u300186.90% \u548c 87.27%\u3002\u4e0e\u5728 PPMI \u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684 MRI \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u7b97\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 SDPN \u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e PD \u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002.",

    "abstract": "To investigate differences in surface electromyography (EMG) features in individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and aged-matched controls.\nSurface EMG was recorded during isometric leg extension in PD patients prior to, and after undergoing a locomotor training programme, and in aged-matched controls. Differences in EMG structure were quantified using determinism (%DET), sample entropy (SampEn) and intermuscular coherence.\n%DET was significantly higher, and SampEn significantly lower, in PD patients. Intermuscular coherence was also significantly higher in the PD group in theta, alpha and beta frequency bands. %DET increased and SampEn decreased with increasing Movement-Disorder-Society UPDRS scores, while theta band coherence was significantly correlated with total MDS-UPDRS scores and torque variance. Neither %DET, SampEn nor intermuscular coherence changed in response to training.\nThe differences observed are consistent with increased synchrony among motor units within and across leg muscles in PD. Differences between EMG signals recorded from the PD and control groups persisted post-therapy, after improvements in walking capacity occurred.\nThese results provide insight into changes in motoneuron activity in PD, demonstrate increased beta band intramuscular coherence in PD for the first time, and support the development of quantitative biomarkers for PD based on advanced surface EMG features.",

    "abstract": "The neuroprotective effect of autophagy activation by rapamycin and trehalose was studied in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD) induced by neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Both rapamycin (10\u202fmg/kg/day, 7\u202fdays) and trehalose (2% in drinking water, 7\u202fdays) increased the expression of LC3-II (a marker of autophagy activation) in the frontal cortex and striatum of normal C57Bl/6J mice, with signs of an additive effect. Autophagy stimulation in the striatum was confirmed by a lysosomal osmotic test. In the model of MPTP-induced PD, the two drugs were applied starting from the 2nd day after subchronic daily MPTP administration (20\u202fmg/kg/day, 4\u202fdays). A marked increase in LC3-II expression in the striatum was detected under the action of trehalose and in the S. nigra after combined treatment with rapamycin and trehalose. The drugs had a positive effect for recovery of dopaminergic neurons and neuroprotection after MPTP-induced PD-like injury. The therapeutic effect was proven by active restoration of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) content in the striatum and S. nigra and by improved cognition measured by the passive avoidance learning task. The results revealed the additive effect of the combined treatment with rapamycin and trehalose on dopaminergic deficits (according to the levels of TH expression in the nigrostriatal system) but not on the behavioral performance in the mouse PD model. Thus, the autophagy activation through different pathways by the combination of rapamycin and trehalose reverses both neuronal dopaminergic and behavioral deficits in vivo and seems to be a promising therapy for PD-like pathology.",

    "abstract": "The neuroimaging-based computer-aided diagnosis for Parkinson's disease (PD) has attracted considerable attention in recent years, where the classifier plays a critical role. Random vector functional link network (RVFL) has shown its effectiveness for classification task, while its extended version, namely RVFL plus (RVFL+), integrates the additional privileged information (PI) about training samples in RVFL to help training a more effective classifier. On the other hand, it is still a popular way to adopt only a single neuroimaging modality for PD diagnosis in a clinical practice. In this work, we construct a novel cascaded multi-column RVFL+ (cmcRVFL+) framework for the single-modal neuroimaging-based PD diagnosis without the additional neuroimaging modality as PI. Specifically, the predicted values of RVFL+ classifiers in the current layers are used as the PI for the following classifiers, and therefore, the PI features are self-generated without additional modality. Furthermore, only the multi-column RVFL+ classifiers in the last layer of cmcRVFL+ are finally ensembled to generate the predictive result in the test stage. The experimental results on both the transcranial sonography data set and the magnetic resonance imaging data set for PD show that the proposed cmcRVFL+ algorithm achieves superior performance to all the compared algorithms. It suggests that the proposed cmcRVFL+ has the potential to be flexibly applied to various single-modal imaging based CAD.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is symptomatic and frequently consists of complicated medication regimes. This negatively influences therapy adherence, resulting in lower benefit of treatment, drug related problems and decreased quality of life (QoL). A potential effective intervention strategy is a structured medication review, executed by community pharmacists. However, little is known about the effects on clinical endpoints like QoL, as well as on feasibility and cost-effectiveness in PD patients.\nTo assess the effect of a structured medication review on QoL in PD patients. Secondary objectives are measurements of physical disability, activities in daily life, non-motor symptoms, health state, personal carers' QoL and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, a better insight in the process of performing medication reviews will be obtained from the perspective of community pharmacists.\nIn this multicenter randomized controlled trial we aim to enroll 200 PD patients from the outpatient clinic of three Dutch hospitals. Community pharmacists will perform a structured medication review in half of the assigned patients; the other half will receive usual care. Data obtained by use of six validated questionnaires will be collected at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of follow-up. Semi-structured interviews with community pharmacists will be conducted till data saturation has been reached.\nThis trial targets a high-risk patient group for whom optimizing therapy by a structured medication review might be of added value. If effectiveness is proven, this could further promote the implementation of pharmaceutical care in a primary care setting.",

    "abstract": "Intentional movement is an internally driven process that requires the integration of motivational and sensory cues with motor preparedness. In addition to the motor cortical-basal ganglia circuits, the limbic circuits are also involved in the integration of these cues. Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) have a particular difficulty with internally generating intentional movements and maintaining the speed, size, and vigor of movements. This difficulty improves when they are provided with external cues suggesting that there is a problem with the internal motivation of movement in PD. The prevailing view attributes this difficulty in PD to the dysfunction of motor cortical-basal ganglia circuits. First, we argue that the standard cortical-basal ganglia circuit model of motor dysfunction in PD needs to be expanded to include the insula which is a major hub within the limbic circuits. We propose a neural circuit model highlighting the interaction between the insula and dorsomedial frontal cortex which is involved in generating intentional movements. The insula processes a wide range of sensory signals arising from the body and integrates them with the emotional and motivational context. In doing so, it provides the impetus to the dorsomedial frontal cortex to initiate and sustain movement. Second, we present the results of our proof-of-concept experiment demonstrating that the functional connectivity of the insula-dorsomedial frontal cortex circuit can be enhanced with neurofeedback-guided kinesthetic motor imagery using functional magnetic resonance imaging in subjects with PD. Specifically, we found that the intensity and quality of body sensations evoked during motor imagery and the emotional and motivational context of motor imagery determined the direction (i.e., negative or positive) of the insula-dorsomedial frontal cortex functional connectivity. After 10-12 neurofeedback sessions and \"off-line\" practice of the successful motor imagery strategies all subjects showed a significant increase in the insula-dorsomedial frontal cortex functional connectivity. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results regarding motor function in patients with PD and propose suggestions for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease. So far, the underlying pathophysiology remains unclear. Several alterations in functional network connectivity have been described in Parkinson's disease patients with cognitive impairment which are probably the result of the heterogenous pathophysiology underlying this cognitive decline, including dopaminergic and cholinergic deficits. Accordingly, the reported resting-state connectivity patterns vary greatly among studies.\nTo evaluate the localization and magnitude of functional connectivity patterns in resting-state brain networks in Parkinson's disease patients with cognitive impairment by pooling data from available studies.\nWe searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO to identify functional MRI studies in Parkinson's disease patients with cognitive impairment. A voxel-based meta-analysis combined with quality statistics was performed, using the anisotropic effect-size version of the signed differential mapping method.\nSeventeen studies with cognitively impaired Parkinson's disease patients were included consisting of 222 Parkinson's disease patients with mild cognitive impairment, 68 patients with Parkinson's disease dementia, 289 cognitively unimpaired Parkinson's disease patients and 353 healthy controls. Parkinson's disease patients with cognitive impairment predominantly showed a reduced connectivity in specific brain regions that are part of the default mode network.\nCognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease is associated with reduced connectivity in networks relevant to cognition, most prominently the default mode network. Specific alterations in functional connectivity may contribute to cognitive decline in Parkinson patients and may be a promising future biomarker.",

    "abstract": "Clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are accompanied by pathological phenomena detected locally in the basal ganglia (BG) as changes in local field potentials (LFPs) and also in cortical regions by electroencephalography (EEG). The literature published mainly between 2000 and 2017 was reviewed with an emphasis on approaches emerging after 2000, in particular on oscillatory dynamics, connectivity studies, and deep brain stimulation. Eighty-five articles were reviewed. The main observations were a general slowing of background activity, excessive synchronization of beta activity, and disturbed movement-related gamma oscillations in the BG and in the cortico-subcortical and cortico-cortical motor loops, suppressible by dopaminergic medication as well as by high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS). Non-motor symptoms are related mainly to changes in the alpha frequency range. EEG parameters can be useful in defining the risk of dementia in PD. Further progress was reported recently using advanced analytical technologies and high-performance computing (graph theory). Detailed knowledge of LFPs in PD enabled progress particularly in DBS therapy, which requires optimizing the clinical effect and minimizing adverse side effects. The neurocognitive networks and their dysfunction in PD and DBS therapy are promising targets for future research.",

    "abstract": "To investigate EEG changes during an auditory odd-ball task while walking (dual-task) in young adults, older adults, and patients with Parkinson's disease.\n11 young adults, 10 older adults, and 10 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) performed an auditory oddball task during standing and walking on a treadmill, while wearing a wireless EEG cap. The amplitude and latency of P300 were compared between groups and within conditions using linear mix model analysis. Gait was evaluated using wearable sensors and cognition was assessed using the Color Trail Test.\nP300 latency became longer during walking in all groups (p\u202f=\u202f0.005). During walking, older adults (p\u202f=\u202f0.005) and patients with PD (p\u202f=\u202f0.001) showed prolonged P300 latency compared to young adults. Significant task by group interaction was found in P300 amplitude (p\u202f=\u202f0.008). Patients with PD demonstrated reduced P300 amplitude during walking compared to standing (p\u202f=\u202f0.023). Among all subjects, better motor and cognitive performance correlated with shorter P300 latency (r\u202f=\u202f0.457, p\u202f=\u202f0.014 and r\u202f=\u202f0.431, p\u202f=\u202f0.040, respectively).\nThese findings provide direct evidence of the physiological recruitment of attentional networks during walking and their impact by ageing and disease.\nThis study is the first to report on changes in P300 latency and amplitude during dual-task oddball walking in older adults and patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Current therapies for Parkinson's disease are symptomatic and unable to regenerate the brain tissue. In recent years, the therapeutic potential of a wide variety of neuroprotective and neuroregenerative molecules such as neurotrophic factors, antioxidants and RNA-based therapeutics has been explored. However, drug delivery to the brain is still a challenge and the therapeutic efficacy of many drugs is limited. In the last decade, micro- and nanoparticles have proved to be powerful tools for the administration of these molecules to the brain, enabling the development of new strategies against Parkinson's disease. The list of encapsulated drugs and the nature of the particles used is long, and numerous studies have been carried out supporting their efficacy in treating this pathology. This review aims to give an overview of the latest advances and emerging frontiers in micro- and nanomedical approaches for repairing dopaminergic neurons. Special emphasis will be placed on offering a new perspective to link these advances with the most relevant clinical trials and with the real possibility of transferring micro- and nanoformulations to industrial scale-up processes. This review is intended as a contribution towards facing the challenges that still exist in the clinical translation of micro- and nanotechnologies to administer therapeutic agents in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), the monoamine oxidase (MAO) metabolite of dopamine, plays a role in pathogenesis of Parkinson disease, inducing \u03b1-synuclein aggregation. DOPAL generates discrete \u03b1-synuclein aggregates. Inhibiting this aggregation could provide therapy for slowing Parkinson disease progression. Primary and secondary amines form adducts with aldehydes. Rasagiline and aminoindan contain these amine groups. DOPAL-induced \u03b1-synuclein aggregates were resolved in the presence and absence of rasagiline or aminoindan using quantitative Western blotting. DOPAL levels in incubation mixtures, containing increased rasagiline or aminoindan concentrations, were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Schiff base adducts between DOPAL and rasagiline or aminoindan were determined using mass spectrometry. A neuroprotective effect of rasagiline and aminoindan against DOPAL-induced toxicity was demonstrated using PC-12 cells. Rasagiline and aminoindan significantly reduced aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein of all sizes in test tube and PC-12 cells experiments. Dimethylaminoindan did not reduce aggregation. DOPAL levels in incubation mixtures were reduced with increasing rasagiline or aminoindan concentrations but not with dimethylaminoindan. Schiff base adducts between DOPAL and either rasagiline or aminoindan were demonstrated by mass spectrometry. A neuroprotective effect against DOPAL-induced toxicity in PC-12 cells was demonstrated for both rasagiline and aminoindan. Inhibiting DOPAL-induced \u03b1-synuclein aggregation through amine adducts provides a therapeutic approach for slowing Parkinson disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence provides support for involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. We propose that a pro-inflammatory intestinal milieu, due to intestinal hyper-permeability and/or microbial dysbiosis, initiates or exacerbates PD pathogenesis. One factor that can cause intestinal hyper-permeability and dysbiosis is chronic stress which has been shown to accelerate neuronal degeneration and motor deficits in Parkinsonism rodent models. We hypothesized that stress-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction and microbial dysbiosis lead to a pro-inflammatory milieu that exacerbates the PD phenotype in the low-dose oral rotenone PD mice model. To test this hypothesis, mice received unpredictable restraint stress (RS) for 12\u202fweeks, and during the last six weeks mice also received a daily administration of low-dose rotenone (10\u202fmg/kg/day) orally. The initial six weeks of RS caused significantly higher urinary cortisol, intestinal hyperpermeability, and decreased abundance of putative \"anti-inflammatory\" bacteria (Lactobacillus) compared to non-stressed mice. Rotenone alone (i.e., without RS) disrupted the colonic expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1, increased oxidative stress (N-tyrosine), increased myenteric plexus enteric glial cell GFAP expression and increased \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) protein levels in the colon compared to controls. Restraint stress exacerbated these rotenone-induced changes. Specifically, RS potentiated rotenone-induced effects in the colon including: 1) intestinal hyper-permeability, 2) disruption of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin1), 3) oxidative stress (N-tyrosine), 4) inflammation in glial cells (GFAP + enteric glia cells), 5) \u03b1-syn, 6) increased relative abundance of fecal Akkermansia (mucin-degrading Gram-negative bacteria), and 7) endotoxemia. In addition, RS promoted a number of rotenone-induced effects in the brain including: 1) reduced number of resting microglia and a higher number of dystrophic/phagocytic microglia as well as (FJ-C+) dying cells in the substantia nigra (SN), 2) increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reactivity in the SN, and 3) reduced dopamine (DA) and DA metabolites (DOPAC, HVA) in the striatum compared to control mice. Our findings support a model in which chronic stress-induced, gut-derived, pro-inflammatory milieu exacerbates the PD phenotype via a dysfunctional microbiota-gut-brain axis.",

    "abstract": "TCS is a well-established technique for diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Volumetric 3D-TCS is a promising complementary approach for objective acquisition and analysis, in particular for less experienced sonographers. This study provides baselines for Parkinson detection (sensitivity and specificity), cutoff values and inter-rater agreement in 3D-TCS.\nWe performed 3D-TCS in 52 subjects (healthy controls and PD) bilaterally, and reconstructed in 3D space uni-laterally. Ipsi-lateral hyperechogenicities in the substantia nigra are manually segmented slice-by-slice in the 3D volume by two raters at different experience levels. ROC threshold analysis is performed and compared on features representing 3D volume and axial cross-sections (2.5D) of hyperechogenicities. Pearson correlation and intra-class correlation coefficients were evaluated for assessment of inter-rater agreement.\n50 subjects were included. Both raters achieved high classification accuracy with 2.5D/3D features extracted from 3D-TCS volumes (best results sensitivity/specificity/cut-off per rater: 84.6%/88.9%/25.0mm\nThe study presents first baseline values for uni-lateral 3D-TCS examination, and finds no disadvantage of uni-lateral reconstructions compared to previous bi-lateral fusion. Volumetric 3D-TCS has potential for a high inter-rater agreement and accuracy in detection of PD, in particular for sonographers with less experience.",

    "abstract": "Partial degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), induces locomotor disability in animals but with time it is spontaneously compensated for by neurons surviving in the tissue by increasing their functional efficiency. Such compensation probably increases energy requirements and astrocyte support could be essential for this ability. We studied the effect of degeneration of dopaminergic neurons induced by the selective toxin 6-hydroxydopamine and/or death of 30% of astrocytes induced by chronic infusion of the glial toxin fluorocitrate on functioning of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain (ETC) complexes (Cxs) I, II, IV and their higher assembled forms, supercomplexes in the rat SN. Astrocyte death decreased Cx I and IV performance, while significantly increased the amount of Cx II protein SDHA, indicating system adaptation. After death of 50% of dopaminergic neurons in the SN, we observed increased mitochondrial Cxs performing, especially Cx I and IV in the remaining cells. It corresponded with reduction of behavioural deficits. Those results support the hypothesis that the compensatory ability of surviving neurons requires meeting their higher energetic demand by ETC. When astrocytes were defective, the neurons remaining after partial lesion were not able to enhance their functioning anymore and compensate for deficits. It proves in vivo that astrocytic support is important for compensatory potential of neurons in the SN. Neuro-glia cooperation is fundamental for compensation for early deficits in the nigrostriatal system.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, neural networks have become very popular in all kinds of prediction problems. In this paper, multiple feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANNs) with various configurations are used in the prediction of Parkinson's disease (PD) of tested individuals, based on extracted features from 26 different voice samples per individual. Results are validated via the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) scheme. Few feature selection procedures based on Pearson's correlation coefficient, Kendall's correlation coefficient, principal component analysis, and self-organizing maps, have been used for boosting the performance of algorithms and for data reduction. The best test accuracy result has been achieved with Kendall's correlation coefficient-based feature selection, and the most relevant voice samples are recognized. Multiple ANNs have proven to be the best classification technique for diagnosis of PD without usage of the feature selection procedure (on raw data). Finally, a neural network is fine-tuned, and a test accuracy of 86.47% was achieved.",

    "abstract": "Drug discovery for Parkinson's disease (PD) is challenging. Here we report that gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) can serve as a novel candidate for the design of anti-PD drugs. With N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine (L-NIBC) protected AuNCs as an example, we show that AuNCs effectively prevent \u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) fibrillation in in vitro experiments. Cell experiments demonstrate good neuroprotective effects in PD cell models. More significantly, experiments of mouse PD model further show that AuNCs largely ameliorate the behavioral disorders of sick mice. In addition, immunohistochemical and western blot (WB) analyses indicate that AuNCs can significantly reverse dopaminergic (DA) neuron loss in substantia nigra and striatum of sick mice. This study opens up a novel avenue to develop anti-PD drugs and points a new direction for AuNCs in medicinal applications.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) remains a common neurodegenerative disorder. Functional neurosurgery largely arose with the introduction of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a potential option for PD unresponsive to medical management. Biomarkers are clinical and laboratory indicators of therapeutic success or failure.\nTo examine the current and published literature relating to the development and use of biomarkers in monitoring and determining the efficacy of DBS in PD.\nThe PubMed database was systematically searched using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for systemic reviews. Studies that examined current or potential biomarkers measurable after DBS were included. Articles from 1952 to date were examined.\nThe initial search identified 49 articles. Thirty articles met the inclusion criteria. Articles were subdivided into those addressing biomarkers with proven clinical usefulness and potential biomarkers that have future application.\nBiomarkers have been identified that can help to determine the effect of DBS on patients with PD. Current studies show that there are measured differences in electrophysiologic oscillations, gene expression, neuropeptide levels, metabolic function, inflammatory activity, and others in the central nervous system after DBS in PD. Local field potential and \u03b2-band analysis stand as the clinically proven biomarkers of choice for DBS in PD. Many of the identified changes noted could be implemented as clinically useful biomarkers through which DBS may be monitored. Future studies are needed to determine which noted physiologic changes are most appropriately used as biomarkers and in which contexts they are most helpful.",

    "abstract": "Although several studies have suggested that abnormalities in gut microbiota may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of PD, data are still extremely heterogeneous.\n16S gene ribosomal RNA sequencing was performed on fecal samples of 350 individuals, subdivided into idiopathic PD (n\u2009=\u2009193, of whom 39 were drug na\u00efve) stratified by disease duration, PSP (n\u2009=\u200922), MSA (n\u2009=\u200922), and healthy controls (HC; n\u2009=\u2009113). Several confounders were taken into account, including dietary habits.\nDespite the fact that unadjusted comparison of PD and HC showed several differences in relative taxa abundances, the significant results were greatly reduced after adjusting for confounders. Although most of these differences were associated with disease duration, lower abundance in Lachnospiraceae was the only difference between de novo PD and HC (remaining lower across almost all PD duration strata). Decreased Lachnospiraceae and increased Lactobacillaceae and Christensenellaceae were associated with a worse clinical profile, including higher frequencies of cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and postural instability. When compared with HC, MSA and PSP patients shared the changes in PD, with a few exceptions: in MSA, Lachnospiraceae were not lower, and Prevotellaceae were reduced; in PSP, Lactobacillaceae were similar, and Streptococcaceae were reduced.\nGut microbiota may be an environmental modulator of the pathogenesis of PD and contribute to the interindividual variability of clinical features. Data are influenced by PD duration and several confounders that need to be taken into account in future studies. Prospective studies in de novo PD patients are needed to elucidate the net effect of dysbiosis on the progression of the disease. \u00a9 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

Although most of these differences were associated with disease duration, lower abundance in Lachnospiraceae was the only difference between de novo PD and HC (remaining lower across almost all PD duration strata). Decreased Lachnospiraceae and increased Lactobacillaceae and Christensenellaceae were associated with a worse clinical profile, including higher frequencies of cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and postural instability. When compared with HC, MSA and PSP patients shared the changes in PD, with a few exceptions: in MSA, Lachnospiraceae were not lower, and Prevotellaceae were reduced; in PSP, Lactobacillaceae were similar, and Streptococcaceae were reduced.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the impact of aging and Parkinson's disease (PD) on lower limb muscle strength before and after muscle fatigue. One hundred thirty-five individuals were distributed over seven groups according to their age (20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years old) and disease. Participants performed maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) in a leg press device followed by the muscle fatigue protocol (repeated sit-to-stand task). Immediately after muscle fatigue (less than 2 min), the MVIC were repeated. The peak force, peak rate of force development (first 50, 100, 200 ms), and root mean square and peak values of the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis muscle activity during MVIC were calculated before and after muscle fatigue. We found more pronounced reductions in lower limb muscle strength parameters (lower limb force, RFD-100 and RFD-200 - p<0.05) in individuals over 50 years of age and with PD. In addition, there was an inverse relation between aging and lower limb muscle strength parameters. The main findings were the lack of changes in peak force, RFDs and muscle activity of the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis after muscle fatigue according to aging and PD, and similar lower limb muscle strength parameters (before and after muscle fatigue) and effect of muscle fatigue in PD compared to the aged groups (60 and 70 years old groups).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1-2% of individuals above 60 years amounting to over 7 million people worldwide. Thus, PD has become an important contributor to the neurological disease burden. Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, and alarmingly, approximately 5.25 million Nigerians are above 65 years and are therefore at risk for developing PD. We carried out a critical review of published literature on PD in Nigeria to summarize the findings and to evaluate gaps in knowledge. Seven electronic databases were searched for studies published in English before 18th July 2018. Search terms were [\"Parkinson's disease\" OR \"Parkinson disease\" OR \"parkinsonian disorders\" OR \"Parkinsonism\"] AND \"Nigeria\". A total of 44 articles (including eight reviews) published since 1969 were identified and reviewed. Amongst the original research articles, most (23) were on PD symptoms or prevalence. There were only two studies on genetics and two on environmental factors. The estimated crude prevalence of PD in Nigeria was lower (10-249/100\u202f000) compared to studies published in Europe (65.6-12\u202f500/100\u202f000). Our findings suggest that PD is under-diagnosed in Nigeria. Possible environmental risk factors identified include blacksmithing and well-water contaminated with trace metals. Given the rising numbers of the ageing population in Nigeria, more studies to evaluate the prevalence and causes of PD in this country are urgently needed. To this end, more funding, resources and a workforce of well-trained neurologists and scientists are essential to manage the impending health burden of PD and related disorders in this country.",

    "abstract": "The clinical characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD) associated with both the LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation and a GBA variant (LRRK2-GBA-PD) have not yet been determined.\nIn this retrospective observational study of Ashkenazi-Jewish (AJ) PD patients, we describe the clinical course and characteristics of LRRK2-GBA-PD and estimate the risk to develop PD for the double mutation carriers. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated using published data on frequencies of GBA and LRRK2 mutations. Demographic and clinical data was retrieved from medical records and from rating at last visit.\nOur analysis included 236 PD patients, divided into four groups: LRRK2-PD (n\u202f=\u202f66), GBA-PD (n\u202f=\u202f78), GBA-LRRK2-PD (n\u202f=\u202f12) and mutation-negative PD (MNPD, n\u202f=\u202f80 randomly selected). The estimated ORs in different models for GBA-LRRK2 PD were 15-28 (95% CI 6.7-72.0, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001), compared to AJ controls. Using logistic regression (while controlling for sex, age at onset and PD duration), we found that probable REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD) was significantly more common for GBA-PD than for LRRK2-PD, while none of the GBA-LRRK2-PD patients reported RBD. Dementia was significantly more common for GBA-PD than for the LRRK2-PD and MNPD. Psychosis was the most common for GBA-PD and least common for LRRK2-GBA-PD.\nWhile GBA-PD is characterized by higher rates of dementia, probable RBD and psychosis, it seems that compared to the other groups, these features are less common for LRRK2-GBA-PD. This may imply to a possible protective effect of LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation among GBA variant carriers.",

The estimated ORs in different models for GBA-LRRK2 PD were 15-28 (95% CI 6.7-72.0, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001), compared to AJ controls. Using logistic regression (while controlling for sex, age at onset and PD duration), we found that probable REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD) was significantly more common for GBA-PD than for LRRK2-PD, while none of the GBA-LRRK2-PD patients reported RBD. Dementia was significantly more common for GBA-PD than for the LRRK2-PD and MNPD. Psychosis was the most common for GBA-PD and least common for LRRK2-GBA-PD.",

    "abstract": "Lead (Pb) is a metal element released into the atmosphere and a major source of environmental contamination. The accumulation and concentration of this metal in a food web may lead to the intoxication of the body, more precisely, the nervous system (NS). In addition, Pb-exposure can cause structural and functional disruption of the NS. Studies have shown that Pb-exposure could be a risk factor in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). The latter is related to dopaminergic deficiency that may be triggered by genetic and environmental factors such as Pb intoxication. In this study, we have evaluated, in one hand, the neurotoxic effect of Pb (25\u2009mg / kg B.W i.p) for three consecutive days on dopaminergic system and locomotor performance in Merione shawi. In the other hand, the possible restorative potential of C. sativus (CS) (50\u2009mg / kg BW) by oral gavage. The immunohistochemical approach has revealed that Pb-intoxicated Meriones show a significant increase of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) levels within the Substantia Nigra compacta (SNc), Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA), Locus Coeruleus (LC), Dorsal Striatum (DS) and Medial Forebrain Bundle (MFB), unlike the control meriones, a group intoxicated and treated with Crocus sativus hydroethanolic extract (CSHEE) and treated group by CSHEE. Treatment with CSHEE, has shown a real potential to prevent all Pb-induced damages. In fact, restores the TH levels by 92%, 90%, 88%, 90% and 93% in SNc, VTA, LC, DS and MFB respectively, similarly, locomotor activity dysfunction in Pb-intoxicaed meriones was reinstated by 90%. In this study, we have revealed a new pharmacological potential of Crocus sativus that can be used as a neuroprotective product for neurodegenerative disorders, especially, which implying dopaminergic and noradrenergic injuries, like PD, trigged by heavy metals.",

    "abstract": "A growing number of clinical trials use various sensors and smartphone applications to collect data outside of the clinic or hospital, raising the question to what extent patients comply with the unique requirements of remote study protocols. Compliance is particularly important in conditions where patients are motorically and cognitively impaired. Here, we sought to understand patient compliance in digital trials of two such pathologies, Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington disease (HD).\nPatient compliance was assessed in two remote, six-month clinical trials of PD (n\u00a0=\u200951, Clinician Input Study funded by the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research) and HD (n\u00a0=\u200917, sponsored by Teva Pharmaceuticals). We monitored four compliance metrics specific to remote studies: smartphone app-based medication reporting, app-based symptoms reporting, the duration of smartwatch data streaming except while charging, and the performance of structured motor tasks at home.\nWhile compliance over time differed between the PD and HD studies, both studies maintained high compliance levels for their entire six month duration. None (-\u20091%) to a 30% reduction in compliance rate was registered for HD patients, and a reduction of 34 to 53% was registered for the PD study. Both studies exhibited marked changes in compliance rates during the initial days of enrollment. Interestingly, daily smartwatch data streaming patterns were similar, peaking around noon, dropping sharply in the late evening hours around 8\u2009pm, and having a mean of 8.6 daily streaming hours for the PD study and 10.5\u2009h for the HD study. Individual patients tended to have either high or low compliance across all compliance metrics as measured by pairwise correlation. Encouragingly, predefined schedules and app-based reminders fulfilled their intended effect on the timing of medication intake reporting and performance of structured motor tasks at home.\nOur findings suggest that maintaining compliance over long durations is feasible, promote the use of predefined app-based reminders, and highlight the importance of patient selection as highly compliant patients typically have a higher adherence rate across the different aspects of the protocol. Overall, these data can serve as a reference point for the design of upcoming remote digital studies.\nTrials described in this study include a sub-study of the Open PRIDE-HD Huntington's disease study (TV7820-CNS-20016), which was registered on July 7th, 2015, sponsored by Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd., and registered on Clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02494778 and EudraCT as 2015-000904-24 .",

    "abstract": "The Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) is a benign heart disease with accessory pathways, which can result in cardiac arrhythmias. The purpose of this case report is to introduce a rare case of sudden cardiac death (SCD) with a mild myocardial bridge and a history of WPW.\nA 25-year-old man with known WPW syndrome died at night while sleeping.\nDiagnosis of WPW syndrome is based on typical electrocardiogram findings with a documented dysrhythmia before the victim's death.\nAt autopsy, no traumatic injury or common poisons were found, only a slight myocardial bridge was detected. We performed whole exome sequencing and identified several genetic variations related to SCD.\nWe considered that the cause of death in this case was SCD in which arrhythmia might play an important role.\nThis case highlights SCD can occur in WPW patients with mild or unrecognized structural abnormality. Postmortem genetic examination can assist the diagnosis of sudden cardiac death, especially when no lethal structural abnormality is found in the decedent.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to clarify the relationship between autonomic and non-autonomic non-motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nSixty-five PD patients were included in this study (27 men and 38 women; aged 68.5 \u00b1 10.0; Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stage 2.6 \u00b1 1.1). The autonomic symptoms were evaluated by the Japanese version of the Scales for outcomes in PD autonomic (SCOPA-AUT) questionnaire. The patients were assessed with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), PD sleep evaluation scale-2 (PDSS-2), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) and Beck's depression inventory II (BDI-II). The Non-Motor Symptom Scale (NMSS) total scores and subscores of non-autonomic non-motor symptom domains (sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems/hallucination, and attention/memory) were evaluated. A dopamine transporter (DAT) scan, metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy, and card type olfactory identification test (open essence [OE, Wako]) were performed.\nThe SCOPA-AUT total score was positively correlated with the disease duration, HY stage, levodopa equivalent dose, PDSS-2, ESS, BDI-II and non-autonomic NMSS and inversely correlated with the MMSE. The high-SCOPA-AUT group (\u22659) had lower MMSE scores and higher PDSS-2, ESS, BDI-II and non-motor NMSS scores than the low-SCOPA-AUT group (< 9). The DAT scan, MIBG uptake and OE score did not differ between the groups. In a stepwise linear regression analysis, which excluded possibly overlapping items among the scales, the subtotals of PDSS-2 items, except for item 8 (nocturia), (p < 0.0001) and non-autonomic NMSS domains (p = 0.00040) were significant predictors of the total SCOPA-AUT score.\nOur study shows significant correlations among autonomic symptoms, PD-related sleep problems and non-autonomic non-motor symptoms in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Treatment with dopaminergic agonists such as pramipexole (PPX) contributes to the development of impulse control disorders (ICDs) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). As such, animal models of abnormal impulse control in PD are needed to better study the pathophysiology of these behaviors. Thus, we investigated impulsivity and related behaviors using the 5-choice serial reaction time task, as well as FosB/\u0394FosB expression, in rats with mild parkinsonism induced by viral-mediated substantia nigra overexpression of human A53T mutated \u03b1-synuclein, and following chronic PPX treatment (0.25\u00a0mg/kg/d) for 4\u00a0weeks. The bilateral loss of striatal dopamine transporters (64%) increased the premature response rate of these rats, indicating enhanced waiting impulsivity. This behavior persisted in the OFF state after the second week of PPX treatment and it was further exacerbated in the ON state throughout the treatment period. The enhanced rate of premature responses following dopaminergic denervation was positively correlated with the premature response rate following PPX treatment (both in the ON and OFF states). Moreover, the striatal dopaminergic deficit was negatively correlated with the premature response rate at all times (pretreatment, ON and OFF states) and it was positively correlated with the striatal FosB/\u0394FosB expression. By contrast, PPX treatment was not associated with changes in compulsivity (perseverative responses rate). This model recapitulates some features of PD with ICD, namely the dopaminergic deficit of early PD and the impulsivity traits provoked by dopaminergic loss in association with PPX treatment, making this model a useful tool to study the pathophysiology of ICDs.",

    "abstract": "The microbiota of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) has been the focus of research in recent years. However, the mechanisms underlying the interactions between the gut microbiome and the brain, as well as its role in PD pathogenesis, remain to be elucidated. In this study, we used a systematic approach to predict putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from the raw metagenomic data of the gut microbiome, and identified 43 BGCs that were significantly enriched in the PD patients. Fourteen of these clusters originated from microbes that were not increased in the patients, and the most significantly enriched one encoded a putative efflux protein and a radical SAM protein, indicating a potential role in PD. Based on a random forest classifier, these BGCs can be used to correctly discriminate between PD patients and healthy controls, with a cross-validated AUC of 0.91 from the 31 early stage PD patients and 28 healthy controls. Our study provides an alternative method to analyze the microbiota of PD patients, and further increase our understanding of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) that potentiate protein aggregation have been implicated in several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In fact, Tau and alpha-synuclein (ASYN) undergo several PTMs potentiating their aggregation and neurotoxicity. Recent data posits a role for acetylation in Tau and ASYN aggregation. Herein we aimed to clarify the role of Sirtuin-2 (SIRT2) and HDAC6 tubulin deacetylases as well as p300 acetyltransferase in AD and PD neurodegeneration. We used transmitochondrial cybrids that recapitulate pathogenic alterations observed in sporadic PD and AD patient brains and ASYN and Tau cellular models. We confirmed that Tau protein and ASYN are microtubules (MTs)-associated proteins (MAPs). Moreover, our results suggest that \u03b1-tubulin acetylation induced by SIRT2 inhibition is functionally associated with the improvement of MT dynamic determined by decreased Tau phosphorylation and by increased Tau/tubulin and ASYN/tubulin binding. Our data provide a strong evidence for a functional role of tubulin and MAPs acetylation on autophagic vesicular traffic and cargo clearance. Additionally, we showed that an accumulation of ASYN oligomers imbalance mitochondrial dynamics, which further compromise autophagy. We also demonstrated that an increase in Tau acetylation is associated with Tau phosphorylation. We found that p300, HDAC6 and SIRT2 influences Tau phosphorylation and autophagic flux in AD. In addition, we demonstrated that p300 and HDAC6 modulate Tau and Tubulin acetylation. Overall, our data disclose the role of Tau and ASYN modifications through acetylation in AD and PD pathology, respectively. Moreover, this study indicates that MTs can be a promising therapeutic target in the field of neurodegenerative disorders in which intracellular transport is altered.",

    "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a disorder commonly found in patients with Parkinson's disease, with descriptions for both conditions impairing dopaminergic transmission in central nervous system. Previous studies in varied populations indicate an association between the presence of RLS and increased cardiovascular risk and, so far, there are no consistent studies of this association in Parkinson's disease. To analyze the influence of RLS on cardiovascular risk in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nWe reviewed the medical records of 202 patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and verified the presence of RLS, cardiovascular comorbidities, blood pressure measurements, lipid profiles and Framingham Risk Scores.\nStatistically significant higher values of total cholesterol were found for the RLS group (mean 216.6 mg/dL), as well as for LDL cholesterol (mean 145 mg/dL). No statistical difference was found among the other factors.\nPatients with Parkinson's disease and RLS have a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia than patients without RLS, suggesting a correlation between restless legs and hyperlipidemia. It is questioned whether the dopaminergic substrate is the main factor in the genesis of the syndrome, as even with the use of dopaminergic agonists by both groups, it was possible to observe differences between groups. The hypothesis of the real interference of the syndrome treatment as a protective factor for cardiovascular risk was generated.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) manifests with a typical movement disorder, due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. There are no disease-modifying treatments, and current management is centered on symptom control using predominantly dopaminergic drugs. While effective at improving the motor symptoms of PD, these treatments result in significant adverse effects, due to non-targeted and non-physiological delivery of dopamine to the brain. For many years, there has been interest in cell grafting as a potential means of restoring dopamine to the striatum in a physiological manner, which would theoretically treat the symptoms of PD that are due to dopamine deficiency, without the motor and neuropsychiatric adverse effects that are seen with dopaminergic medications. A number of cell sources have been trialed in PD patients, but lack of efficacy, ethical and logistical barriers have meant that most of these do not offer useful treatment options. Stem cell-based treatments are emerging as the most promising approach for the development of a useful regenerative treatment that could be used in a large number of patients. Although progress in this field has been slow, a number of exciting clinical trials are now on the horizon, and there is genuine hope that stem cells will enter the clinic in the short- to medium-term future.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is one of the common chronic degenerative conditions of the nervous system. There is currently no cure for PD, but a number of drugs offer benefits in terms of controlling the motor symptoms. While these drugs can offer significant improvements to motor function, they may lead to problematic adverse effects, particularly as disease progresses. In this chapter, we focus on the drugs that are currently employed for the treatment of PD, including discussion on their mode of action, clinical utility, and adverse effects. We also cover some interesting emerging approaches that are currently under investigation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a heterogenous disease with a varying age of onset, symptoms, and rate of progression. This heterogeneity requires the use of a variety of animal models to study different aspects of the disease. Neurotoxin-based approaches include exposure of rodents or non-human primates to 6-OHDA, MPTP, and agrochemicals such as the pesticide rotenone, the herbicide paraquat, and the fungicide maneb. Acute exposure to neurotoxins induces motor deficits and rapid nigro-striatal dopaminergic cell death by disrupting mitochondrial function and/or increasing oxidative stress, while chronic administration of neurotoxins induces progressive models which can include alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-synuclein) aggregates. Genetic-based approaches to model Parkinson\u2019s disease include transgenic models and viral vector-mediated models based on genes linked to monogenic Parkinson\u2019s disease, including SNCA, LRRK2, UCH-L1, PRKN, PINK1, and and DJ-1, as well as manipulation of dopaminergic transcription factors. SNCA mutations, overexpression, and introduction of \u03b1-synuclein preformed fibrils induce toxic protein aggregates and variable nigro-striatal neurodegeneration and motor deficits, depending on the specific model. Species, genetic background of a strain, and environment affect the display of symptoms and neurodegenerative hallmarks of animal models. These models can be combined to study the interplay between genetics and environment and untangle the heterogeneity and mechanisms underlying Parkinson\u2019s disease. In this chapter, we discuss the strengths and limitations of mouse, rat, and non-human primate models of Parkinson\u2019s disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson\u2019s disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly. The motor symptoms occur predominantly due to substantial dopamine depletion, caused by degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta. Apoptosis has been implicated as the main mechanism of neuronal death in Parkinson\u2019s disease. Apoptosis is mediated by a number of initiator and executioner caspases, and occurs via the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways. Activation of initiator caspase-9 mediates the intrinsic pathway\u2014also called the mitochondria-mediated pathway. Alternatively, activation of initiator caspase-8 mediates the extrinsic apoptotic pathway\u2014the cell death receptor\u2013mediated pathway. Both initiator caspases converge onto a common pathway of executioner caspases, involving caspase-3 and caspase-6. Activation of the executioner caspases leads to the morphological features characteristic of apoptosis, such as DNA cleavage and its subsequent fragmentation. Proapoptotic factors, such as Bax, have been implicated in neuronal cell death in Parkinson\u2019s disease, and there is evidence that both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways may play a role. This chapter provides an overview of apoptosis and its significance in Parkinson\u2019s disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder. While a number of non-motor manifestations arise, the typical clinical features involve a movement disorder consisting of bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity, with postural instability occurring at a later stage. The cause of PD is not known, but a number of genetic risk factors have now been characterized, as well as several genes which cause rare familial forms of PD. Environmental influences such as smoking, caffeine consumption, and pesticide exposure have been postulated to alter the risk of PD development, although the role of these remains unclear. The movement disorder arises due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, with the pathological hallmark being intracellular aggregates of \u03b1-synuclein, in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Several processes have been implicated in PD, including mitochondrial dysfunction, defective protein clearance mechanisms, and neuroinflammation, but the way in which these factors interact remains incompletely understood.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is a key feature of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). In postmortem PD brains, microglial activation and enhanced major histocompatibility class II (MHCII) expression are seen concomitant to the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-synuclein) and loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra. Recent findings showed that \u03b1-synuclein epitopes can be presented and recognized by T-cells. PD is not a single disorder; rather, it encompasses a range of clinical, epidemiological, and genetic subtypes. Around 10% of the cases have a monogenic origin, and several of the disease-causing mutations are linked to inflammatory processes. The remaining 90% of the cases are complex, where environmental and genetic risk factors synergize to induce PD pathology. To date, 41 genetic loci have been identified in genome-wide association studies as associated with PD risk, and among these, two are within the HLA region, coding for immune genes including MHCII. Thus, genetic and immune findings indicate that the immune system has a role in the etiology of PD. Experimentally, inflammatory stimuli can cause selective nigral cell loss in preclinical models of PD, and MHCII is required to elicit \u03b1-synuclein-induced pathology in mice. In this chapter, we focus on immunogenetics, that is, the relation between genetic risk factors and immune processes in PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a common, progressive neurodegenerative disease. It is a movement disorder presenting primarily with a combination of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. However, it has a variable presentation, including the presence of non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairment and sleep disturbance. The diagnosis is made clinically by the recognition of these key features and the exclusion of other causes of parkinsonism. This chapter describes how to recognize the core motor and non-motor features of PD, as well as atypical features that suggest an alternative cause of parkinsonism. The essentials of these alternative diagnoses are outlined, and the list of differentials is structured into sections on other neurodegenerative causes of parkinsonism, secondary causes of parkinsonism, genetic causes of parkinsonism, tremor disorders, and non-neurological differentials of PD.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for improving motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease among well-selected patients. Over the past 30 years, several anatomical regions have been targeted with DBS based on prior experience in lesional neurosurgery and characteristic changes in subcortical motor regulation in Parkinson\u2019s disease. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the patient selection process and surgical procedure for DBS. We also discuss the various surgical targets for DBS in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. The subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus interna are the most common surgical targets among patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease and have equivalent beneficial effects on motor symptoms. Most studies report 30\u201360% improvement in motor score evaluations after DBS among well-selected patients. After subthalamic nucleus DBS, patients are able to reduce medications by 50% on average. In patients with globus pallidus interna DBS, stimulation has an anti-dyskinetic effect, although medication doses remain similar. DBS of the subthalamic nucleus is generally avoided in patients with a history of depression or neurocognitive impairment. Thalamic DBS ameliorates tremor, but has little effect on bradykinesia or rigidity. Finally, the pedunculopontine nucleus DBS is an emerging experimental treatment for postural and gait instability in Parkinson\u2019s disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson\u2019s disease is an increasingly common neurodegenerative condition, which causes not only dysfunction of movement but also a broad range of nonmotor features, including mood disturbance, sleep dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive deficits, dementia, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. A major conundrum in this condition is understanding its striking clinical variability, which encompasses a spectrum from a benign phenotype with levodopa-responsive symptoms and minimal progression, to a malignant phenotype with rapid progression to severe gait dysfunction, falls and dementia. This book integrates the considerable expertise of a range of authors from different disciplines, from clinicians through to basic scientists, to present a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of Parkinson\u2019s disease. In recent years, we have made significant progress in understanding the pathological and genetic basis of Parkinson\u2019s disease and its heterogeneous forms, and the first section of the book is dedicated to reviewing this. The variable clinical features of Parkinson\u2019s disease and its differential diagnosis are then considered. The final section provides a detailed overview of treatment approaches, including not only pharmacological therapies but also surgical therapies including deep brain stimulation and cell transplantation strategies. The combination of basic biology, clinical knowledge and therapeutics gives this book a very broad appeal. It will be of value to clinicians and health professionals caring for patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, as well as providing an excellent introduction for junior researchers entering the field.",

    "abstract": "Early features of Parkinson's disease (PD) include both motor and cognitive changes, suggesting shared common pathways. A common motor dysfunction is postural instability, a known predictor of falls, which have a major impact on quality of life. Understanding mechanisms of postural dynamics in PD and specifically how they relate to cognitive changes is essential for developing effective interventions. The aims of this study were to examine the changes that occur in postural metrics over time and explore the relationship between postural and cognitive dysfunction. The study group consisted of 35 people (66 \u00b1 8years, 12 female, UPDRS III: 22.5 \u00b1 9.6) diagnosed with PD who were recruited as part of the Incidence of Cognitive Impairment in Cohorts with Longitudinal Evaluation-PD Gait (ICICLE-GAIT) study. Postural and cognitive assessments were performed at 18, 36, and 54 months after enrolment. Participants stood still for 120 s, eyes open and arms by their side. Postural dynamics were measured using metrics derived from a single tri-axial accelerometer (Axivity AX3, York, UK) on the lower back. Accelerometry metrics included jerk (derivative of acceleration), root mean square, frequency, and ellipsis (acceleration area). Cognition was evaluated by neuropsychological tests including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and digit span. There was a significant decrease in accelerometry parameters, greater in the anteroposterior direction, and a decline in cognitive function over time. Accelerometry metrics were positively correlated with lower cognitive function and increased geriatric depression score and negatively associated with a qualitative measure of balance confidence. In conclusion, people with PD showed reduced postural dynamics that may represent a postural safety strategy. Associations with cognitive function and depression, both symptoms that may pre-empt motor symptoms, suggest shared neural pathways. Further studies, involving neuroimaging, may determine how these postural parameters relate to underlying neural and clinical correlates.",

    "abstract": "[Purpose] The effect of physiotherapy on stooped posture in Parkinson's disease patients remains to be clarified. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether comprehensive physiotherapy-based rehabilitation can improve stooped posture in Parkinson's disease patients. [Participants and Methods] The participants were Parkinson's disease patients with stooped posture. Outpatients were assigned to the control group and inpatients to the postural rehabilitation group. The outcomes measured were trunk bending angle, lumbar lordosis, and thoracic kyphosis. Each group was assessed at baseline and 1 month later. [Results] Of 22 participants identified, 20 were included, with 10 participants in the postural rehabilitation group and 10 in the control group. The age in the postural rehabilitation group was significantly greater than that in the control group, while other parameters were comparable in both groups. After the month-long intervention, the trunk bending angle and lumbar lordosis were significantly improved in the postural rehabilitation group compared to the control group. [Conclusion] The results showed improvement in stooped posture in the postural rehabilitation group as compared to the control group. Furthermore, improvement of lumbar lordosis accompanied improvement of stooped posture. These findings suggest that comprehensive physiotherapy-based rehabilitation may improve stooped posture in Parkinson's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "The importance of understanding the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease (PD) by systematic recording of prediagnostic symptoms and reductions in body functions has been highlighted. The aim of this study was to investigate whether persons later diagnosed with PD exhibit increased physician-certified sickness absence 1, 2, and 5 years prior to a first sick-leave episode attributed to PD. A case-control study was performed to analyze data from all nontrivial (exceeding 14 days) sick-leave episodes in Sweden between 2008 and 2014. The 537 incident PD sick-leave episodes were identified as PD sick-leave cases and compared to 537 sick-leave controls identified by matching age, sex, and date of the first day of the sick-leave episode. The total sickness absence and sickness absence due to musculoskeletal diagnoses were found to be increased among the PD sick-leave cases from 5 years prior to the first sick-leave episode ascribed to PD when compared to the controls. No differences between PD sick-leave cases and sick-leave controls were found with regard to mental and behavioral diagnoses. We conclude that the capacity to participate in working life is reduced already at the early prediagnostic stages of PD. This finding can be used as a basis for further research into the process of identifying individuals at risk for developing PD, particularly in combination with further investigation into biochemical, genetic, and imaging biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) is an observational, international study designed to establish biomarker-defined cohorts and identify clinical, imaging, genetic, and biospecimen Parkinson's disease (PD) progression markers to accelerate disease-modifying therapeutic trials.\nA total of 423 untreated PD, 196 Healthy Control (HC) and 64 SWEDD (scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit) subjects were enrolled at 24 sites. To enroll PD subjects as early as possible following diagnosis, subjects were eligible with only asymmetric bradykinesia or tremor plus a dopamine transporter (DAT) binding deficit on SPECT imaging. Acquisition of data was standardized as detailed at www.ppmi-info.org.\nApproximately 9% of enrolled subjects had a single PD sign at baseline. DAT imaging excluded 16% of potential PD subjects with SWEDD. The total MDS-UPDRS for PD was 32.4 compared to 4.6 for HC and 28.2 for SWEDD. On average, PD subjects demonstrated 45% and 68% reduction in mean striatal and contralateral putamen Specific Binding Ratios (SBR), respectively. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was acquired from >97% of all subjects. CSF (PD/HC/SWEDD pg/mL) \u03b1-synuclein (1845/2204/2141) was reduced in PD vs HC or SWEDD (\nPPMI has detailed the biomarker signature for an early PD cohort defined by clinical features and imaging biomarkers.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by both motor and nonmotor features. The diagnose of PD is based on a review of patients' signs and symptoms, and neurological and physical examinations. So far, no tests have been devised that can conclusively diagnose PD. In this study, we explore both microRNA and gene biomarkers for PD. Microarray gene expression profiles for PD patients and healthy control are analyzed using a principal component analysis (PCA)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE). 244 genes are selected to be potential gene biomarkers for PD. In addition, we implement these genes into Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, and find that the 15 microRNAs (miRNAs), hsa-miR-92a-3p, 16-5p, 615-3p, 877-3p, 100-5p, 320a, 877-5p, 23a-3p, 484, 23b-3p, 15a-5p, 324-3p, 19b-3p, 7b-5p and 505-3p, significantly target these 244 genes. These miRNAs are shown to be significantly related to PD. This reveals that both selected genes and miRNAs are potential biomarkers for PD.",

    "abstract": "Small G-proteins are structurally-conserved modules that function as molecular on-off switches. They function in many different cellular processes with differential specificity determined by the unique effector-binding surfaces, which undergo conformational changes during the switching action. These switches are typically standalone monomeric modules that form transient heterodimers with specific effector proteins in the 'on' state, and cycle to back to the monomeric conformation in the 'off' state. A new class of small G-proteins called \"Roco\" was discovered about a decade ago; this class is distinct from the typical G-proteins in several intriguing ways. Their switch module resides within a polypeptide chain of a large multi-domain protein, always adjacent to a unique domain called COR, and its effector kinase often resides within the same polypeptide. As such, the mechanisms of action of the Roco G-proteins are likely to differ from those of the typical G-proteins. Understanding these mechanisms is important because aberrant activity in the human Roco protein LRRK2 is associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. This review provides an update on the current state of our understanding of the Roco G-proteins and the prospects of targeting them for therapeutic purposes.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests the important role of sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) in the pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the association between potential functional polymorphisms in the SIRT2 gene and PD still needs to be identified. Exploring the molecular mechanism underlying this potential association could also provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of this disorder.\nBioinformatics analysis and screening were first performed to find potential microRNAs (miRNAs) that could target the SIRT2 gene, and molecular biology experiments were carried out to further identify the regulation between miRNA and SIRT2 and characterize the pivotal role of miRNA in PD models. Moreover, a clinical case-control study was performed with 304 PD patients and 312 healthy controls from the Chinese Han population to identify the possible association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the miRNA binding sites of SIRT2 with the risk of PD.\nHere, we demonstrate that miR-486-3p binds to the 3' UTR of SIRT2 and influences the translation of SIRT2. MiR-486-3p mimics can decrease the level of SIRT2 and reduce a-synuclein (\u03b1-syn)-induced aggregation and toxicity, which may contribute to the progression of PD. Interestingly, we find that a SNP, rs2241703, may disrupt miR-486-3p binding sites in the 3' UTR of SIRT2, subsequently influencing the translation of SIRT2. Through the clinical case-control study, we further verify that rs2241703 is associated with PD risk in the Chinese Han population.\nThe present study confirms that the rs2241703 polymorphism in the SIRT2 gene is associated with PD in the Chinese Han population, provides the potential mechanism of the susceptibility locus in determining PD risk and reveals a potential target of miRNA for the treatment and prevention of PD.",

    "abstract": "Retrospective cohort.\nParkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. PD patients often develop spinal conditions and are known to have high complication rates following surgery. This study evaluated the outcomes of lumbar fusion surgery in patients with PD using a large, public, national database.\nThe Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to identify elective lumbar spinal fusion patients with and without PD for the years 2000 to 2012. PD patients were matched with non-PD controls for comorbidity and age using propensity score matching. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to determine the relationship between PD and surgical outcomes in the matched cohort.\nA total of 231\u2009351 elective lumbar fusion patients were examined, of which 1332 had PD. Before matching, elective lumbar fusion patients with PD were significantly older (\nAnalysis demonstrated significant increases in length and cost of hospitalization for elective lumbar spinal fusion in patients with PD. However, inpatient complication rates in PD patients were not significantly increased. As a growing number of PD patients undergo elective spine surgery, further studies are needed to optimize operative planning.

    "abstract": "Disturbance of gait is a key feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and has a negative impact on quality of life. Deficits in cognition and sensorimotor processing impair the ability of people with PD to walk quickly, efficiently and safely. Recent evidence suggests that emotional disturbances may also affect gait in PD.\nWe explored if there were relationships between walking ability, emotion and cognitive impairment in people with PD.\nThe literature was firstly reviewed for unimpaired individuals. The recent experimental evidence for the influence of emotion on gait in people with PD was then explored. The contribution of affective disorders to continuous gait disorders was investigated, particularly for bradykinetic and hypokinetic gait. In addition, we investigated the influence of emotional processing on episodic gait disturbances, such as freezing of gait. Potential effects of pharmacological, surgical and physical therapy interventions were also considered.\nEmerging evidence showed that emotional disturbances arising from affective disorders such as anxiety and depression, in addition to cognitive impairment, could contribute to gait disorders in some people with PD. An analysis of the literature indicated mixed evidence that improvements in affective disorders induced by physical therapy, pharmacological management or surgery improve locomotion in PD.\nWhen assessing and treating gait disorders in people with PD, it is important to take into the account non-motor symptoms such as anxiety, depression and cognitive impairment, in addition to the motor sequalae of this progressive neurological condition.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between falls and static and dynamic postural control has not been established in Parkinson's disease (PD). The purpose was to compare the compensatory postural strategies among fallers and non-fallers with PD as well as older adults during static and dynamic movements.\nTwenty-five individuals with PD (11 fallers) and 17 older adults were outfitted with 6 accelerometers on the wrists, ankles, lumbar spine, and sternum, stood quietly for 30\u2009s on a force platform, and walked back and forth for 30\u2009s along a 15\u2009m walkway. Root-mean-square displacement amplitude of the center of pressure (COP), COP velocity, gait spatial-temporal characteristics, trunk range of motion (ROM), and peak trunk velocities were obtained.\nCOP velocity in anterior-posterior was larger in older adults than those with PD (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Trunk frontal ROM and velocity were smaller in fallers and non-fallers with PD compared to older adults (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Trunk anterior-posterior ROM and velocity were smaller in fallers than non-fallers with PD and older adults (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In fallers with PD, negative correlations were shown between the sagittal trunk velocity and the COP velocity in the anterior-posterior direction as well as between trunk frontal velocity and COP velocity in both directions (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In non-fallers with PD, horizontal trunk ROM and velocity were positively correlated with COP ROM and velocity in the medial-lateral direction (p\u2009<\u20090.01).\nDynamic postural control revealed better discrimination between groups than static. Fallers and non-fallers with PD and older adults adopted different compensatory strategies during static and dynamic movements; thereby providing important information for falls-risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "Impairments of postural stability occur with increasing age and in neurodegenerative diseases like the Parkinson's disease (PD). While changes in balance have been described in many studies under steady-state conditions, less is known about the dynamic changes in balance following sudden transition to different sensory inputs.\nThe aim was to clarify different effects of age and Parkinson's disease on dynamic postural responses immediately after lower leg muscle stimulation offset. Sudden removing of active sensory input represents a transient period in balance control.\nPostural responses of 13 young, 13 healthy elderly and 13 PD patients to proprioceptive bilateral vibration of soleus muscles during stance were assessed by a force platform and two accelerometers attached on the upper and the lower trunk. The experimental protocol consisted of 2 conditions of soleus muscle vibration with 1) eyes open and 2) eyes closed randomly repeated four times.\nDuring vibration period before stimulus offset, postural responses were similar in elderly and PD patients. Contrary, immediately after vibration offset significantly larger backward amplitude of centre of foot pressure (CoP) displacement and trunk tilts were observed in PD patients compared to healthy peers. In returning to vertical position, peak-to-peak amplitudes, maximal velocity of CoP and trunk tilts significantly increased in PD patients. Without vision, their postural responses were more enhanced. The differences between young and elderly were found in most parameters in transient period after vibration offset and also during vibration.\nThe PD patients showed more unstable transient postural responses to selective sensory stimulation switch off, which may reflect impairment of sensory reweighting in balance control. Understanding how early stages PD patients differ in balance control from neurologically intact peers may help researchers and clinicians to refine their intervention and fall prevention programs.",

    "abstract": "We aimed at testing the potential of biomarkers in predicting individual patient response to dopaminergic therapy for Parkinson's disease. Treatment efficacy was assessed in 30 Parkinson's disease patients as motor symptoms improvement from unmedicated to medicated state as assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score III. Patients were stratified into weak and strong responders according to the individual treatment response. A multiple regression was implemented to test the prediction accuracy of age, disease duration and treatment dose and length. Univariate voxel-based morphometry was applied to investigate differences between the two groups on age-corrected T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Multivariate support vector machine classification was used to predict individual treatment response based on neuroimaging data. Among clinical data, increasing age predicted a weaker treatment response. Additionally, weak responders presented greater brain atrophy in the left temporoparietal operculum. Support vector machine classification revealed that gray matter density in this brain region, including additionally the supplementary and primary motor areas and the cerebellum, was able to differentiate weak and strong responders with 74% accuracy. Remarkably, age and regional gray matter density of the left temporoparietal operculum predicted both and independently treatment response as shown in a combined regression analysis. In conclusion, both increasing age and reduced gray matter density are valid and independent predictors of dopaminergic therapy response in Parkinson's disease.",

Five reviews and 40 experimental papers have shown that rhythmic stimulation and dance provide the motor, cognitive, and quality of life benefits for participants with Parkinson disease. Thus, sound stimuli and dance offer satisfactory effects for gait, improving cognitive abilities such as motor control and adjustment and spatial memory. In addition, these new treatment modalities stimulate the elderly population to practice physical exercise, generating well-being and helping self-esteem.\nDance and music therapy interventions are noninvasive, simple treatment options, which promote gait and cognition.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between estimated residential exposure to agricultural chemical application and premature mortality from Parkinson's disease (PD) in Washington State. Washington State mortality records for 2011\u207b2015 were geocoded using residential addresses, and classified as having exposure to agricultural land-use within 1000 meters. Generalized linear models were used to explore the association between land-use associated with agricultural chemical application and premature mortality from PD. Individuals exposed to land-use associated with glyphosate had 33% higher odds of premature mortality than those that were not exposed (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.33, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) = 1.06\u207b1.67). Exposure to cropland associated with all pesticide application (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.98\u207b1.44) or Paraquat application (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.99\u207b1.51) was not significantly associated with premature mortality from PD, but the effect size was in the hypothesized direction. No significant associations were observed between exposure to Atrazine (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 0.84\u207b1.74) or Diazinon (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.85\u207b1.34), and premature mortality from PD. The relationship between pesticide exposure and premature mortality aligns with previous biological, toxicological, and epidemiological findings.

    "abstract": "Recently, several studies using transcranial sonography (TCS) have demonstrated reduced echogenicity of the mesencephalic midline in unipolar depression and patients with comorbid depression and Parkinson disease (PD). However, there is no consensus on the conclusion that raphe nuclei (RN) hypoechogenicity is associated with depression in PD. The methods used in previous studies lack quantitative and objective indicators to some extent; therefore, the present study used the level of platelet 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) as an objective indicator of depression. Additionally, the reason for the reduced echogenicity of the brainstem raphe is still unclear.\nThe purpose of the present study was to assess the correlation between alterations in RN echogenicity and depressive symptoms in patients with PD using transcranial sonography (TCS). This information could provide a meaningful clinical reference for the antidiastole between depressive symptoms in PD and unipolar depression in patients with PD in whom depressive symptoms occur before motor symptoms.\nTCS was performed in patients with PD, patients with PD and depression, patients with depression and no PD, and healthy controls. Using the red nucleus as a reference, the RN was rated from grades 0 to 1 (grade 0: invisible, slightly echogenic, or interrupted RN; grade 1: hyperechogenicity in the RN observed as a continuous line).\nThe rate of abnormal RN (grade 0) was found to be 16.67% in patients with PD (5/30) and 14.29% in healthy controls (4/28). The presence of abnormal RN was significantly higher (\u03c7\u200a=\u200a15.983, P\u200a<\u200a.05) in patients with depression and PD (40%, 12/30) and in patients with depression only (58.33%, 14/24) than in those without depression and healthy controls. No correlation was found between RN changes and depression severity (P\u200a>\u200a.05). There were no statistical differences in the concentration of platelet serotonin among the 4 groups (P\u200a>\u200a.05).\nTCS of the mesencephalic midline may be useful for detecting depression, which is an early symptom of PD. However, further neuropathological studies are needed to understand the principles underlying the use of platelet serotonin as a peripheral biomarker, as well as the connection between PD and depression.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative brain disorder, resulting in decreased neural responses in the supplementary motor area, putamen, and thalamus. Previous research showed that acupuncture was able to improve the motor dysfunction. The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of longer acupuncture treatment for preventing brain degeneration in patients with PD.\nTen outpatients with PD were recruited from Kyung Hee Medical Hospital. Behavioral and neural responses were examined before and after 8 weeks of acupuncture treatment. A semi-individualized treatment approach was used; patients were treated for 15 minutes with 120-Hz electro-acupuncture at the right GB34 and Taechung (LR3), followed by manual acupuncture based on the individual symptoms of the patient.\nImmediately after 8 weeks of acupuncture treatment, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) sub-scores and the depression scores for the patients had statistically decreased compared to the scores before acupuncture treatment; moreover, 8 weeks later, these scores remained stable. Compared to the neural responses before the acupuncture stimulation, those after the acupuncture treatment were significantly higher in the thalamus, cingulate gyrus, anterior cingulate, lingual gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, lateral globus pallidus, mammillary body, middle temporal gyrus, cuneus, and fusiform gyrus. Finally, a positive correlation was found between the UPDRS and the mean magnetic resonance signal change for the thalamus.\nThis study found beneficial clinical effects of 8-week acupuncture treatment in the brains of patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a sporadic neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology, characterized pathologically by \u03b1-synuclein aggregates preferentially found in oligodendroglial cells. DNA methylation has emerged as a mechanism of regulation of \u03b1-synuclein expression. Reduced 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) DNA methylation of \u03b1-synuclein has been found in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) methylation is another epigenetic modification of DNA. It is involved in the de-methylation of DNA, gene regulation, and DNA repair mechanisms. Here, we examined sections of human paraffin-embedded brain tissue from the cerebellum and brain stem, including the substantia nigra pars compacta, of patients with PD (n\u2009=\u20098) and MSA (n\u2009=\u20098) as well as age-matched controls (n\u2009=\u20098). The neocortical tissue of PD patients (n\u2009=\u200910) and controls (n\u2009=\u200910) was also examined. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed the expression of 5-mC and 5-hmC with an automatic, rater-independent semi-quantification method. We found a significant upregulation of 5-mC, but not 5-hmC, in cortical sections from PD patients. The brain stem and substantia nigra, and in particular the dopaminergic neurons, showed unchanged levels of both 5-mC- and 5-hmC-immunoreactivity in all groups. In the cerebellum, 5-mC was significantly decreased only in MSA patients in the granule cell layer; in contrast, 5-hmC was significantly upregulated in the cerebellar white matter of both PD and MSA patients. Our study showed different levels of expression of total 5-mC and 5-hmC methylation across different brain regions in PD and for the first time in MSA. Our results indicate that 5-mC may be relevant in MSA. The underlying mechanism of the differential 5-mC and 5-hmC expression remains unclear.",

    "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) are trace elements that are essential for proper growth and physiological functions as both play critical role in a variety of enzymatic reactions. At high concentrations, however, they can be toxic and cause neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Parkinson-like syndromes. Nicotine, on the other hand, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects against various endogenous or exogenous toxins that selectively damage the dopaminergic cells. These cells include neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cells which express significant dopaminergic activity. However, practically no information on possible neuroprotective effects of nicotine against toxicity induced by trace elements is available. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effects of nicotine on toxicity induced by manganese or iron in these cells. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells for 24\u202fh to manganese (20\u202f\u03bcM) or iron (20\u202f\u03bcM) resulted in approximately 30% and 35% toxicity, respectively. Pretreatment with nicotine (1\u202f\u03bcM) completely blocked the toxicities of Mn and Fe. The effects of nicotine, in turn, were blocked by selective nicotinic receptor antagonists. Thus, dihydro-beta erythroidine (DHBE), a selective alpha 4-beta 2 subtype antagonist and methyllycaconitine (MLA), a selective alpha7 antagonist, as well as mecamylamine, a non-selective nicotinic antagonist all dose-dependently blocked the protective effects of nicotine against both Mn and Fe. These findings provide further support for the potential utility of nicotine or nicotinic agonists in Parkinson's disease-like neurodegenerative disorders, including those that might be precipitated by trace elements, such as Fe and Mn. Moreover, both alpha4-beta2 and alpha7 nicotinic receptor subtypes appear to mediate the neuroprotective effects of nicotine against toxicity induced by these two trace metals.",

    "abstract": "To examine the risk of developing Parkinson's Disease (PD) in patients who are newly diagnosed with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).\nThis was a cohort study using the British Columbia (BC) Retinal Disease Database. Data from 2009 to 2013 was accessed. Rates of PD in patients prior to the diagnosis of nAMD were computed and compared to the rates of patients newly diagnosed with PD after the diagnosis of nAMD.\nThe rate of PD prior to the diagnosis of nAMD was 1.42 per 100,000 person-years. The rate of PD after the diagnosis of nAMD was 2.88/100,000 person-years. The rate ratio was 2.03 (95% CI; 1.31-3.16).\nThe findings suggest that patients who are diagnosed with nAMD are at a significantly higher risk of developing PD later in life. More studies are needed to identify the pathological mechanism between the two diseases.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates longitudinal changes in self-reported physical activity, measured by Physical Activity Scale of the Elderly (PASE), in early Parkinson's disease (PD) and matched healthy control (HC) participants in the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and evaluates associations between physical activity and PD progression.\nPPMI is a prospective, longitudinal study evaluating markers of progression in PD participants who are unmedicated at enrollment. PASE, a self-reported measure of physical activity, was administered to early PD (N\u202f=\u202f380) and HC (N\u202f=\u202f174). PASE was introduced after study launch and therefore administered at years 2, 3, and 4. PASE scores for PD and HC were compared with t-tests and changes over time were evaluated with generalized estimating equations.\nThere were no differences in activity levels between PD and HC at any time point. However, PD participants had a longitudinal decrease in PASE from years two to four (p\u202f=\u202f0.034), while HC did not (p\u202f=\u202f0.89). In exploratory analyses controlling for age, sex, and disease duration, higher self-reported activity at year 2 were associated with slower progression of motor symptoms (p\u202f=\u202f0.018), ADL performance (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001), depression (p\u202f=\u202f0.001), anxiety (p\u202f=\u202f0.002), and cognitive decline (p\u202f=\u202f0.016) over two years. These findings remained significant after adjusting for disease severity.\nThere are no differences in self-reported physical activity between HC and early PD, but activity levels decline longitudinally in PD. Exploratory analyses show that higher self-reported physical activity is associated with less disease progression. Therefore, interventions to increase physical activity in early PD could potentially modify the disease course.",

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective procedure in improving motor symptoms for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) through the use of high-frequency stimulation. Although one of the most commonly used target sites for DBS, sensorimotor regions of the globus pallidus interna (GPi) have yet to be thoroughly described with advanced neuroimaging analysis in vivo for human subjects. Furthermore, many imaging studies to date have been performed in a research setting and bring into question the feasibility of their applications in a clinical setting, such as for surgical planning. This study compares two different tractography methods applied to clinically feasible acquisition sequences in identifying sensorimotor regions of the GPi and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with advanced PD selected to undergo DBS.\nSeven patients with refractory PD selected for DBS were examined by MRI. Diffusion images were acquired with an average acquisition time of 15 minutes. Probabilistic and deterministic tractography methods were applied to each diffusion-weighted data set using FSL and MRtrix, respectively. Fiber assignment was performed using combined sensorimotor areas as initiation seeds and the STN and GPi, separately, as inclusion masks. Corticospinal tracts were excluded by setting the cerebral peduncles as exclusion masks. Variability between proposed techniques was shown using center of gravity (CoG) coordinates.\nDeterministic and probabilistic corticopallidal and corticosubthalamic pathways were successfully reconstructed for all subjects across all target sites (bilaterally). Both techniques displayed large connections between the sensorimotor cortex with the posterolateral aspect of the ipsilateral GPi and the posterosuperolateral aspect of the ipsilateral STN. The average variability was 2.67 mm, with the probabilistic method identifying the CoG consistently more posterior and more lateral than the deterministic method.\nSuccessful delineation of the sensorimotor regions in both the GPi and STN is achievable within a clinically reasonable timeframe. The techniques described in this paper may enhance presurgical planning with increased accuracy and improvement of patient outcomes in patients undergoing DBS. The variability found between tracking techniques warrants the use of the probabilistic tractography method over the deterministic method for presurgical planning. Probabilistic tractography was found to have an advantage over deterministic tractography in its sensitivity, in accurately describing previously described tracts, and in its ability to detect a larger number of fibers.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggesting an important role of gut-derived inflammation in brain disorders has opened up new directions to explore the possible role of the gut-brain axis in neurodegenerative diseases. Given the prominence of dysbiosis and colonic dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), we propose that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated intestinal dysfunction could contribute to intestinal and central inflammation in PD-related neurodegeneration.\nTo test this hypothesis we performed studies in both human tissue and a murine model of PD. Inflammation, immune activation and microbiota composition were measured in colonic samples from subjects with PD and healthy controls subjects and rotenone or vehicle-treated mice. To further assess the role of the TLR4 signalling in PD-induced neuroinflammation, we used TLR4-knockout (KO) mice in conjunction with oral rotenone administration to model PD.\nPatients with PD have intestinal barrier disruption, enhanced markers of microbial translocation and higher pro-inflammatory gene profiles in the colonic biopsy samples compared with controls. In this regard, we found increased expression of the bacterial endotoxin-specific ligand TLR4, CD3+ T cells, cytokine expression in colonic biopsies, dysbiosis characterised by a decrease abundance of SCFA-producing colonic bacteria in subjects with PD. Rotenone treatment in TLR4-KO mice revealed less intestinal inflammation, intestinal and motor dysfunction, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, relative to rotenone-treated wild-type animals despite the presence of dysbiotic microbiota in TLR4-KO mice.\nTaken together, these studies suggest that TLR4-mediated inflammation plays an important role in intestinal and/or brain inflammation, which may be one of the key factors leading to neurodegeneration in PD.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation on gene expression related to inflammation, insulin and lipid in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nThis randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in 40 subjects with PD. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups to take either 1000\u2009mg/day of omega-3 fatty acids from flaxseed oil plus 400\u2009IU/day of vitamin E supplements or placebo (n\u2009=\u200920 each group) for 12 weeks. Gene expression related to inflammation, insulin and lipid were quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of PD patients with RT-PCR method.\nAfter the 12-week intervention, compared with the placebo, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation downregulated gene expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) (P\u2009=\u20090.002) in PBMC of subjects with PD. In addition, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) (P\u2009=\u20090.03), and downregulated oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (P\u2009=\u20090.002) in PBMC of subjects with PD compared with the placebo. We did not observe any significant effect of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation on gene expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-8 in PBMC of patients with PD.\nOverall, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation for 12 weeks in PD patients significantly improved gene expression of TNF-\u03b1, PPAR-\u03b3 and LDLR, but did not affect IL-1 and IL-8.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), iron accumulation in the substantia nigra (SN) exacerbates oxidative stress and \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, leading to neuronal death. However, the influence of iron-related nigral degeneration on the subcortical function and global network configuration in PD remains unknown. Ninety PD patients and 38 normal controls underwent clinical assessments and multimodality magnetic resonance imaging scans. Iron accumulation in the inferior SN and disrupted functional connectivity between the bilateral striatums were observed in PD, and negative correlation between them was found in the whole population. The binarized functional network exhibited enhanced global efficiency and reduced local efficiency while the weighted functional network exhibited reduction in both, and both changes were correlated with nigral iron accumulation in PD. Mediation analysis demonstrated that the functional connectivity between bilateral striatums was a mediator between the nigral iron accumulation and weighted functional network alterations. In conclusion, our findings reveal that iron-related nigral degeneration possibly influences the functional topology mediated by striatal dysfunction, which extends the scientific understanding of PD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease (PD) is yet to be clarified. Non-motor risk factors including cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance and mood disorders have been shown in freezing of gait.\nWe aimed to determine the predictive value of non-motor features in freezing of gait development.\nData were obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Fifty PD patients with self-reported freezing of gait, and 50 PD patients without freezing of gait at the fourth year visit were included. Groups were matched for Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III scores. Several cognitive and non-cognitive tests were used for non-motor features at baseline and over time. Executive function, visuospatial function, processing speed, learning and memory tests were used for cognition. Non-cognitive tests included sleepiness, REM sleep behavior disorder, depression and anxiety scales.\nPatients with freezing of gait had higher scores on sleepiness, REM sleep behavior disorder, depression and anxiety scales. However, predictor model analysis revealed that baseline processing speed, learning and sleepiness scores were predictive of self-reported freezing of gait development over time.\nOur findings suggest that specific cognitive deficits and sleep disorders are predictive of future freezing of gait. These features may be helpful in identifying underlying networks in freezing of gait and should be further investigated with neuroimaging studies.",

Nevertheless, consistent parameters need to be established for research purposes.\nTo verify the effectiveness of acute tDCS on non-motor and motor symptoms in PD.\nA double-blind, randomized and sham-controlled study, in which twenty individuals randomly underwent two (one real, one sham) stimulation sessions. The current was applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 20\u2009min at 2\u2009mA. Participants were assessed before and after the stimulation using the Trail Making Test (TMT), Verbal Fluency test, Stroop test, Timed Up and Go test and video gait analysis. In the statistical analysis, a two-way variance analysis of repeated measures was applied to the variables time, group and time vs. group interaction, using Sidak's post-hoc test.\nStatistically significant differences were found for TMT part B in both groups. For the Verbal Fluency test differences were found only within the group that received real stimulation. Additionally, both groups revealed improved reaction time in the congruent, incongruent and total phases of the Stroop test, but a significant difference in the Stroop effect was found only within the group that received real stimulation.\nThe results confirm that improvements on cognitive tests are possible after a single session of DLPFC stimulation.",

    "abstract": "The production of dopaminergic (DA) neurons from stem cells holds a great promise for future clinical treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells (OE-MSCs) derived from the adult human olfactory mucosa can be easily isolated and expanded in culture while maintaining their immense plasticity. In addition to reduced ethical concerns, OE-MSCs could be transplanted across allogeneic barriers, making them desirable stem cells for clinical applications. The goal of this study was to define the potentiality of human olfactory mucosa-derived MSCs aimed at differentiation into DA neuron-like cells. OE-MSCs were induced to differentiate to DA neuron-like cells in vitro by using sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Then the differentiated neurons were characterized for expression of DA neuron markers by Real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. Our findings showed that differentiated OE-MSCs could significantly express DA neuron markers at mRNA and protein levels along with dopamine release 12 days post-differentiation. These results support the viability and feasibility of using OE-MSCs as a source of in vitro generated DA neuron-like cells for treatment of DA disorders namely PD.",

To convert to a bipolar setting, the negative contact used for the monopolar configuration remained constant and the adjacent dorsal contact was rendered positive, while increasing the voltage by 30%. fMRI activation/deactivation maps and motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) scores were compared for patients in both configurations.\nT-tests were used to compare UPDRS scores and volumes of tissue activated (VTA) diameters in monopolar and bipolar configurations.\nThe patterns of fMRI activation in the monopolar and bipolar configurations were generally different. The thalamus, pallidum, and visual cortices exhibited higher activation using the patient's clinical settings than the presumed equivalent settings. VTA diameters were lower (7\u2009mm vs. 6.3\u2009mm, P\u2009=\u20090.047) and UPDRS scores were generally higher in the bipolar (33.2\u2009\u00b1\u200916) than in the monopolar configuration (28.3\u2009\u00b1\u200917.4), without reaching statistical significance (P > 0.05).\nMonopolar and bipolar configurations result in different patterns of brain activation while using a previously published monopolar-bipolar conversion algorithm. Clinical benefits may be achieved with varying patterns of brain responses. Blind conversion from one to the other should be avoided for purposes of understanding the mechanisms of DBS.\n1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 1 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2018.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterised by aberrant accumulation of insoluble proteins, including alpha-synuclein, and a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The extended neurodegeneration leads to a drop of striatal dopamine levels responsible for disabling motor and non-motor impairments. Although the causes of the disease remain unclear, it is well accepted among the scientific community that the disorder may also have a genetic component. For that reason, the number of genetically engineered animal models has greatly increased over the past two decades, ranging from invertebrates to more complex organisms such as mice and rats. This trend is growing as new genetic variants associated with the disease are discovered. The EU Joint Programme - Neurodegenerative Disease Research (JPND) has promoted the creation of an online database aiming at summarising the different features of experimental models of Parkinson's disease. This review discusses available genetic models of PD and the extent to which they adequately mirror the human pathology and reflects on future development and uses of genetically engineered experimental models for the study of PD.",

    "abstract": "Synchronized oscillations within and between brain areas facilitate normal processing, but are often amplified in disease. A prominent example is the abnormally sustained beta-frequency (\u223c20 Hz) oscillations recorded from the cortex and subthalamic nucleus of Parkinson's disease patients. Computational modeling suggests that the amplitude of such oscillations could be modulated by applying stimulation at a specific phase. Such a strategy would allow selective targeting of the oscillation, with relatively little effect on other activity parameters. Here, activity was recorded from 10 awake, parkinsonian patients (6 male, 4 female human subjects) undergoing functional neurosurgery. We demonstrate that stimulation arriving on a particular patient-specific phase of the beta oscillation over consecutive cycles could suppress the amplitude of this pathophysiological activity by up to 40%, while amplification effects were relatively weak. Suppressive effects were accompanied by a reduction in the rhythmic output of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons and synchronization with the mesial cortex. While stimulation could alter the spiking pattern of STN neurons, there was no net effect on firing rate, suggesting that reduced beta synchrony was a result of alterations to the relative timing of spiking activity, rather than an overall change in excitability. Together, these results identify a novel intrinsic property of cortico-basal ganglia synchrony that suggests the phase of ongoing neural oscillations could be a viable and effective control signal for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. This work has potential implications for other brain diseases with exaggerated neuronal synchronization and for probing the function of rhythmic activity in the healthy brain.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a well-known neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic (DA) neuron loss and \u03b1-synuclein aggregation. Recent study revealed that the extracts from sea cucumber, Holothuroidea spp., exhibited neuroprotective and lifespan extension effects in Caenorhabditis elegans model. Interestingly, the black sea cucumber, Holothuria leucospilota, possesses body wall and a specialized organ called cuvierian tubules containing high amount of bioactive compounds. In this study, the neuroprotective effects of the body wall (BW) and cuvierian tubules (CT) from this sea cucumber against PD were evaluated using C. elegans as a model. H. leucospilota were extracted using ethanol (ET), ethyl acetate (EA), butanol (BU) and aqueous (AQ) fractions. Extracts from these fractions were used to treat the 6-OHDA-induced BZ555 and \u03b1-synuclein expressing NL5901 strains of C. elegans. Treatment with ET, EA, BU and AQ fractions of H. leucospilota extracts could significantly prevent degeneration of DA neurons in 6-OHDA-induced worms, improve food-sensing behavior mediated by DA neurons, and up-regulate cat-2 and sod-3 gene expressions. These results indicate the neuroprotective activity of the extracts which may be attributed to the anti-oxidant activity of the bioactive compounds. Moreover, \u03b1-synuclein aggregation was significantly reduced together with the recovery of lipid deposition upon the treatment with H. leucospilota extracts. In addition, treatment with H. leucospilota extracts was able to increase the lifespan of 6-OHDA-induced N2. NMR analysis revealed the major chemical components in the effective EA fractions were terpenoids, steroids, saponins, and glycosides. In summary, H. leucospilota extracts exhibited anti-Parkinson effect in both toxin-induced and transgenic C. elegans models of PD. Further study will be performed to elucidate the most effective anti-PD molecules which will lead to the development of anti-PD drug.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, disabling neurodegenerative disorder. It has been shown Toll like receptor (TLR) 4-deficient mice protect against MPTP toxicity, suggesting that dopaminergic cell death is TLR4-dependent. The aim of this study was to demonstrate, in an in vivo model of PD, how TLR4 plays its important role in the pathogenesis of PD by using MPTP neurotoxin model (4\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202fmg/kg, 2\u202fh apart, i.p). Our experiments have demonstrated that the absence of TLR4 prevented dopamine depletion, increased tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter activities and reduced the number of \u03b1-synuclein-positive neurons. The absence of TLR4 also had an impact on inflammatory processes, modulating the transcription factors NF-\u03baB p65 and AP-1, and reducing astrogliosis. Importantly, we demonstrated that the absence of TLR4 modulated inflammosome pathway. Moreover, it has been shown that TLR4 modulated motor and non-motor symptoms typical of PD. Our results clearly demonstrated that absence of TLR4 reduces the development of neuroinflammation associated with PD through NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and inflammasome pathways modulation; therefore, TLR4 could be considered as an encouraging therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is highly comorbid with sleep dysfunction. In contrast to motor symptoms, few therapeutic interventions exist to address sleep symptoms in PD. Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) treats advanced PD motor symptoms and may improve sleep architecture. As a proof of concept toward demonstrating that STN-DBS could be used to identify sleep stages commensurate with clinician-scored polysomnography (PSG), we developed a novel artificial neural network (ANN) that could trigger targeted stimulation in response to inferred sleep state from STN local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from implanted DBS electrodes. STN LFP recordings were collected from nine PD patients via a percutaneous cable attached to the DBS lead, during a full night's sleep (6-8\u00a0hr) with concurrent polysomnography (PSG). We trained a feedforward neural network to prospectively identify sleep stage with PSG-level accuracy from 30-s epochs of LFP recordings. Our model's sleep-stage predictions match clinician-identified sleep stage with a mean accuracy of 91% on held-out epochs. Furthermore, leave-one-group-out analysis also demonstrates 91% mean classification accuracy for novel subjects. These results, which classify sleep stage across a typical heterogenous sample of PD patients, may indicate spectral biomarkers for automatically scoring sleep stage in PD patients with implanted DBS devices. Further development of this model may also focus on adapting stimulation during specific sleep stages to treat targeted sleep deficits.",

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated delivery of human \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) gene in rat substantia nigra (SN) results in increased expression of \u03b1-syn protein in the SN and striatum which can progressively degenerate dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, this model is thought to recapitulate the neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Here, using AAV to deliver \u03b1-syn above the SN in male and female rats resulted in clear expression of human \u03b1-syn in the SN and striatum. The protein was associated with moderate behavioral deficits and some loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the nigrostriatal areas. However, the immunohistochemistry results were highly variable and showed little to no correlation with behavior and the amount of \u03b1-syn present. Expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a control to monitor gene delivery and expression efficacy. AAV-GFP resulted in a similar or greater TH loss compared to AAV-\u03b1-syn and therefore an additional vector that does not express a protein was tested. Vectors with double-floxed inverse open reading frame (DIO ORF) encoding fluorescent proteins that generate RNA that is not translated also resulted in TH downregulation in the SN but showed no significant behavioral deficits. These results demonstrate that although expression of wild-type human \u03b1-syn can cause neurodegeneration, the variability and lack of correlation with outcome measures are drawbacks with the model. Furthermore, design and control selection should be considered carefully because of conflicting conclusions due to AAV downregulation of TH, and we recommend caution with having highly regulated TH as the only marker for the dopamine system.",

    "abstract": "Do the current swallow-specific subquestions of neurological diagnostic tools reflect the objective swallowing function in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients or are clinical factors superior to predict critical aspiration?\nIn a cross-sectional, observational study a total of 119 Parkinson outpatients were examined clinically and by flexible-endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Self-reported dysphagia by subquestions of the MDS-UPDRS and NMS questionnaire and history of subjective aspiration signs were collected.\nNearly, all PD patients showed deglutition abnormalities in FEES (113/119) while only 12%-27% of them reported swallowing problems in the swallow-specific subquestions of neurological standard diagnostic tools (MDS-UPDRS and NMS-Quest), and the answers were heterogeneous and poorly reproducible. With a sensitivity of up to a maximum of 50%, self-reported dysphagia is therefore no reliable tool for identifying dysphagia in PD. While most clinical parameters were linked to dysphagia to some extent, logistic regression analysis revealed high age (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.1 in years, 95% CI 1.03-1.18, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), gender (OR 0.3 for females, 95% CI 0.08-0.97, P\u00a0=\u00a00.04), and affirmed subjective aspiration signs (OR 8.6, 95% CI 3.05-26.52, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) as the most significant predictors for critical dysphagia.\nSelf-perception of swallowing is no reliable tool for identifying dysphagia and questionnaires are insufficient for detecting previous aspiration. Consequent and specific asking for previous subjective aspiration signs is the single most important measure for identifying PD patients at risk for critical aspiration.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a well-defined nonmotor manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD), greatly impairs functioning and quality of life. However, the contribution of cerebral perfusion, quantified by arterial spin labeling (ASL), to MCI in PD remains poorly understood. The selection of an optimal delay time is difficult for single-delay ASL, a problem which is avoided by multidelay ASL. This study uses a multidelay multiparametric ASL to investigate cerebral perfusion including cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial transit time (ATT) in early stage PD patients exhibiting MCI using a voxel-based brain analysis. Magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired on a 3.0\u2009T system at rest in 39 early stage PD patients either with MCI (PD-MCI, N\u2009=\u200922) or with normal cognition (PD-N, N\u2009=\u200917), and 36 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs). CBF and ATT were compared among the three groups with SPM using analysis of variance followed by post hoc analyses to define regional differences and examine their relationship to clinical data. PD-MCI showed prolonged ATT in right thalamus compared to both PD-N and HC, and in right supramarginal gyrus compared to HC. PD-N showed shorter ATT in left superior frontal cortex compared to HC. Prolonged ATT in right thalamus was negatively correlated with the category fluency test (p\u2009=\u2009.027, r\u2009=\u2009-0.495) in the PD-MCI group. This study shows that ATT may be a more sensitive marker than CBF for the MCI, and highlights the potential role of thalamus and inferior parietal region for MCI in early stage PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neuroinflammatory disorders and inflammatory processes seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. Chemokines as inflammatory mediators, which are involved in the recruitment of leukocytes, can play a role in the pathogenesis of PD. The aim of this study was to examine the serum level of eotaxins (CCL11, CCL24, and CCL26) and the expression of C-C chemokine receptor type 3 (CCR3) in patients with PD compared with healthy subjects. In this study, we measured the serum levels of CCL11, CCL24, and CCL26 with ELISA. In addition, gene and protein expression of CCR3 were measured by RT-PCR and flow cytometry techniques in PD patients (n\u2009=\u200930) and age- and sex-matched healthy subjects (n\u2009=\u200930). All patients suffering from PD were assessed clinically through Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Motor Examination (UPDRS ME). The results of this study showed that there was no significant alteration in the serum level of these chemokines and also their receptor among patients with PD and healthy subjects. No significant correlation was observed between the eotaxins serum levels and the clinical measures of PD severity. Based on the results, it can be concluded that eotaxins cannot be considered as appropriate targets for the diagnosis or treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "ALS patients (n\u2009=\u200970) and PP patients (n\u2009=\u200933: 20 PSP, 3 CBD, and 10 MSA) were available from an existing database of patients with neuromuscular and movement disorders while age-matched healthy controls (n\u2009=\u200929) were selected from a prospective study. To generate both disease-discriminative (direct classification) and disease-specific (classification versus controls) metabolic brain patterns, data were spatially normalized and a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed prior to classification using either logistic regression (PCA-LR) or a support vector machine (PCA-SVM). Furthermore, a direct SVM approach was considered. To compare the three different approaches, Pearson correlations (r) between pattern expression scores and metabolic brain patterns were evaluated, while pairs of ALS- and PP-specific pattern expression scores were compared using the RV coefficient.\nClassification between ALS and PP resulted in a sensitivity and specificity \u2265\u20090.82 for both direct classification and classification according to disease-specific pattern expression scores. PCA-LR, PCA-SVM, and SVM generated very similar metabolic brain patterns with voxelwise correlations \u2265\u20090.66, while all patterns allowed straightforward identification of ALS- and PP-specific brain regions of hyper- and hypometabolism. Moreover, pattern expression scores were highly correlated among different classifiers with a mean r of 0.94 while a RV coefficient \u2265\u20090.91 was found between pairs of ALS- and PP-specific pattern expression scores.\nWe demonstrated that a classification between ALS and PP using expression scores of an ALS and PP metabolic brain pattern leads to a similar and high prediction accuracy as direct classification between ALS and PP. Classification performance and disease-specific metabolic patterns, which could support visual reading and improve insight in brain pathology, were very related for different classifiers.",

Of 7455 patients included in this study, 3561 were not ambulatory and 3894 were ambulatory or assisted ambulatory. Patients with poor walking status revealed higher FUNDES-Adult scores in all domains. Age, modified Hoehn\u207bYahr stage, living in an institution and the standardized score of FUNDES-Adult domains 1 and 2 were positive independent predictors of the not ambulatory status. The FUNDES-Adult could evaluate multifaceted disability and predict the walking status in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in the treatment of Parkinson disease (PD)-related tremor has been well established. However, the relative impact on arm, leg, and chin tremor has been less clearly elucidated. The authors evaluated the distribution of tremors in a PD cohort undergoing STN DBS and sought to evaluate the differential impact of DBS as a function of tremor location.\nA retrospective study of patients with PD with tremor who underwent DBS surgery between 2012 and 2016 was performed to evaluate the impact of STN stimulation on overall and regional tremor scores.\nAcross 66 patients the authors found an average of 78% overall reduction in tremor after 6 months. In this cohort, the authors found that tremor reduction was somewhat better for arm than for leg tremors, especially in instances of higher preoperative tremor (84% vs 71% reduction, respectively, for initial tremor scores \u2265 2). No significant difference in response was found between patients with medication-responsive versus medication-nonresponsive tremors.\nThe authors found that although DBS improved tremor in all regions, the improvement was not uniform between chin, arm, and leg-even within the same patient. The reasons behind these differing responses are speculative but suggest that STN DBS may more reliably reduce arm tremors than leg tremors.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), there is a wide field of recent and ongoing search for useful biomarkers for early and differential diagnosis, disease monitoring or subtype characterization. Up to now, no biofluid biomarker has entered the daily clinical routine. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is often used as a source for biomarker development in different neurological disorders because it reflects changes in central-nervous system homeostasis. This review article gives an overview about different biomarker approaches in PD, mainly focusing on CSF analyses. Current state and future perspectives regarding classical protein markers like alpha\u2011synuclein, but also different \"omics\" techniques are described. In conclusion, technical advancements in the field already yielded promising results, but further multicenter trials with well-defined cohorts, standardized protocols and integrated data analysis of different modalities are needed before successful translation into routine clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with various cognitive impairments. However, the nature of cognitive modification in patients with PD remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we examined whether patients with PD could correct and maintain subjective time duration and line length estimation. After training sessions, in which participants repeatedly memorized either a duration or a length, we compared a learning performance in 20 PD patients with 20 healthy controls. In the case of duration in the PD patients, the learned durations immediately returned to baseline of pre-training within a few minutes. However, the patients' ability to learn length estimation remained unimpaired. In contrast, healthy controls were able to retain the learned duration and length estimations. Time compression in PD's internal clock may become entrained to their altered duration estimation even after learning of accurate time duration. These deficits may be associated with disrupting cognitive modification in PD.",

    "abstract": "To determine the time course of hazard for motor and nonmotor milestones of Parkinson disease (PD) in the long term and to investigate whether risk scales nonlinearly with time is instrumental in identifying changes in pathological processes and evaluating disease-modifying therapies in PD.\nOutpatients with PD at the Lyon University Movement Disorders Center were evaluated for 7 clinical milestones in this retrospective cohort study, encompassing 4 domains of PD progression: (1) motor (motor fluctuations, dyskinesias); (2) axial (postural instability and falls, freezing of gait); (3) neuropsychiatric (impulse control disorders, hallucinations); and (4) cognitive (dementia) complications. For each complication, we estimated the outcome-specific hazard using parsimonious smooth parametric Poisson regression models allowing for nonlinear scaling over disease duration, age at diagnosis, current age, and their interaction.\nA total of 1,232 patients with PD experienced 1,527 disease-related complications in up to 12 years of follow-up. Specific to each complication, hazard rates increased dramatically starting from diagnosis and were highest for motor fluctuations and lowest for dementia up to 6 years after diagnosis in patients aged 65 years at diagnosis. Nonlinear patterns indicated dramatic changes in the course of PD after 5 years and predicted more severe axial prognosis after 70 years and for motor fluctuations, dyskinesias, and impulse control disorders before 60 years at diagnosis.\nTime course of motor and nonmotor milestones in PD is determined by disease duration and age at diagnosis in nonlinear patterns and their interaction. This indicates disease- and age-specific thresholds across the multiple neurodegenerative processes accumulating in PD at different paces.",

Specific to each complication, hazard rates increased dramatically starting from diagnosis and were highest for motor fluctuations and lowest for dementia up to 6 years after diagnosis in patients aged 65 years at diagnosis. Nonlinear patterns indicated dramatic changes in the course of PD after 5 years and predicted more severe axial prognosis after 70 years and for motor fluctuations, dyskinesias, and impulse control disorders before 60 years at diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "The immune system is activated in Parkinson's Disease (PD), as evidenced by neuroinflammatory changes within the brain as well as elevated immune markers in peripheral blood. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokine levels in the blood are associated with disease severity and rate of progression. However, the factors driving this immune response in PD are not well established. We investigated cell-extrinsic factors in systemic immune activation by using \u03b1-synuclein monomers and fibrils, as well as bacterial toxins, to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from 31 patients and age/gender-matched controls. \u03b1-synuclein monomers or fibrils resulted in a robust cytokine response (as measured by supernatant cytokine concentrations and mRNA expression in cultured cells) in both PD and control PBMCs, similar to that induced by bacterial LPS. We found no PD vs. control differences in cytokine production, nor in mRNA expression. Levels of endotoxin within the recombinant \u03b1-synuclein used in these experiments were very low (0.2-1.3EU/mL), but nonetheless we found that comparable levels were sufficient to potentially confound our cytokine concentration measurements for a number of cytokines. However, \u03b1-synuclein monomers increased production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 to levels significantly in excess of those induced by low-level endotoxin. In conclusion, this study: (i) highlights the importance of accounting for low-level endotoxin in antigen-PBMC stimulation experiments; (ii) indicates that cell-extrinsic factors may be a major contributor to immune activation in PD; and (iii) suggests that \u03b1-synuclein may play a role in inflammasome-related cytokine production in the periphery.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the synucleinopathies spectrum of disorders typified by the presence of intraneuronal protein inclusions. It is primarily composed of misfolded and aggregated forms of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), the toxicity of which has been attributed to the transition from an \u03b1-helical conformation to a \u03b2-sheetrich structure that polymerizes to form toxic oligomers. This could spread and initiate the formation of \"LB-like aggregates,\" by transcellular mechanisms with seeding and subsequent permissive templating. This hypothesis postulates that \u03b1-syn is a prion-like pathological agent and responsible for the progression of Parkinson's pathology. Moreover, the involvement of the inflammatory response in PD pathogenesis has been reported on the excessive microglial activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. At last, we describe several treatment approaches that target the pathogenic \u03b1-syn protein, especially the oligomers, which are currently being tested in advanced animal experiments or are already in clinical trials. However, there are current challenges with therapies that target \u03b1-syn, for example, difficulties in identifying varying \u03b1-syn conformations within different individuals as well as both the cost and need of long-duration large trials.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive and selective death of dopaminergic neurons. Orexin-A is involved in many biological effects of the body. It has been reported that orexin-A has protective effects in cellular models of PD. However, little is known about the protective effects of orexin-A in animal parkinsonian models and the cellular mechanism has not yet been fully clarified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of orexin-A in MPTP mice model of PD as well as the possible neuroprotective mechanisms of orexin-A on dopaminergic neurons. The results from animal experiments demonstrated that orexin-A attenuated the loss of dopaminergic neurons and the decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in the substantia nigra, normalized the striatal dopaminergic fibers, and prevented the depletion of dopamine and its metabolites in the striatum. MPTP-treated mice showed cognitive impairments accompanied with significant motor deficiency. Orexin-A improved MPTP-induced impairments in both motor activity and spatial memory. Importantly, orexin-A increased the protein level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Furthermore, the protective effects of orexin-A on MPTP parkinsonian mice could be blocked by orexinergic receptor 1 (OX1R) antagonist, SB334867. In another set of experiments with SH-SY5Y dopaminergic cells, orexin-A significantly induced the expression of BDNF in a dose and time-dependent manner. The upregulation of BDNF is mainly concerned with PI3K and PKC signaling pathways via OX1R. The present study demonstrated that orexin-A exerted neuroprotective effects on MPTP parkinsonian mice, which may imply orexin-A as a potential therapeutic target for PD.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the structural changes of the brain that correlate with physical frailty and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.\nSixty-one PD patients and 59 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. For each participant, a frailty assessment using Fried's criteria and comprehensive neuropsychological testing using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III and Cognitive Ability Screening Instrument were conducted, and structural brain MR images were acquired for voxel-based morphometric analysis. The neuropsychological testing includes various tests in these five domains: attention, executive, memory, speech and language, and visuospatial functions. Exploratory group-wise comparisons of gray matter volume (GMV) in the PD patients and controls were conducted. Voxel-wise multiple linear regression analyses were conducted for physical frailty-related and cognitive impairment-related GMV changes in the PD patients. Voxel-wise multiple linear regressions were also performed with the five cognitive domains separated using the same model.\nThe PD patients exhibited diffuse GMV reductions in comparison to the controls. In the PD patients, physical frailty-related decreases in GMV were observed in the bilateral frontal and occipital cortices, while cognitive impairment-related decreases in GMV were observed in the bilateral frontal, occipital, and temporal cortices. These regions overlap in the lateral occipital cortex. After the five domains of cognitive functions were analyzed separately, physical frailty-related decreases in GMV still overlap in lateral occipital cortices with every domain of cognitive impairment-related decreases in GMV.\nReduced GMV in the lateral occipital cortex is associated with cognitive impairment and physical frailty in PD patients.\n\u2022 Physical frailty in PD was associated with decreased GMV in the frontal and occipital cortices, while cognitive impairment was associated with decreased GMV in the frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices. \u2022 Physical frailty and cognitive impairment were both associated with decreased GMV in the lateral occipital cortex, which is part of the ventral object-based visual pathway. \u2022 Decreased GMV in the lateral occipital cortex may serve as a potential imaging biomarker for physical frailty and cognitive impairment in PD.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the effect of Parkinson's disease related protein DJ-1 on the cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration in human osteosarcoma cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms. \u2029 Methods: The protein expression levels of DJ-1 were detected in human osteosarcoma cell lines (MG-63, Saos-2, and U2OS) and human osteoblast cell line hFOB1.19 with or without deficiency in phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN) were detected by Western blot. Osteosarcoma cells were treated with DJ-1 siRNA, and then the protein expression levels of DJ-1 were detected by Western blot. Cell survival rate of osteosarcoma cells was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells was measured by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) double staining method. Cell invasive and migration ability of osteosarcoma cells were examined by transwell invasion and migration assay. \u2029 Results: Compared with that of human osteoblast cell line (hFOB1.19), the protein expression level of DJ-1 was significantly upregulated in human osteosarcoma cell lines (MG-63, Saos-2, and U2OS) (all P<0.05), and U2OS had the highest level of DJ-1 when compared with the other three cell lines (P<0.01). DJ-1 siRNA could significantly down-regulate the DJ-1 protein expression in U2OS cells, and also diminish the cell survival rate. Moreover, DJ-1 down-regulation of DJ-1 could promote cell apoptosis, suppress the ability of cell invasion and migration, and increase the PTEN protein expression level (all P<0.05). In addition, the protein expression level of PTEN was markedly up-regulated in human osteosarcoma cell lines when compared with that in the hFOB1.19 cells (P<0.05). \u2029 Conclusion: DJ-1 can promote the cell proliferation, inhibit cell apoptosis, and decrease the ability of cell invasion and migration, and the potential underlying mechanisms may be associated with the up-regulation of PTEN protein expression.\n\u76ee\u7684\uff1a\u7814\u7a76\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u76f8\u5173\u86cb\u767dDJ-1\u5bf9\u4eba\u9aa8\u8089\u7624\u7ec6\u80de\u589e\u6b96\u3001\u51cb\u4ea1\u3001\u4fb5\u88ad\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aWestern \u5370\u8ff9\u68c0\u6d4b\u9aa8\u8089\u7624\u7ec6\u80de\u682a(MG-63\uff0cSaos-2\u548cU2OS)\u53ca\u6b63\u5e38\u4eba\u6210\u9aa8\u7ec6\u80de\u682ahFOB1.19\u4e2dDJ-1\u548c\u7b2c10\u53f7\u67d3\u8272\u4f53\u4e0a\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u78f7\u9178\u9176\u4e0e\u5f20\u529b\u86cb\u767d\u540c\u6e90\u7269(phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10\uff0cPTEN)\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u3002DJ-1 siRNA\u5904\u7406\u4eba\u9aa8\u8089\u7624\u7ec6\u80de\u540e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Western\u5370\u8ff9\u68c0\u6d4bDJ-1\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u7ec6\u80de\u8ba1\u6570\u8bd5\u5242\u76d2(cell counting kit-8\uff0cCCK-8)\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u80de\u5b58\u6d3b\u7387\uff1b\u819c\u8054\u86cb\u767dV(annexin V)-\u5f02\u786b\u6c30\u9178\u8367\u5149\u7d20(fluorescein isothiocyanate\uff0cFITC)/\u7898\u5316\u5421\u5576(propidium iodide\uff0cPI)\u53cc\u67d3\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u80de\u51cb\u4ea1\uff1bTranswell\u4fb5\u88ad\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u80de\u4fb5\u88ad\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u4e0ehFOB1.19\u7ec6\u80de\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u9aa8\u8089\u7624\u7ec6\u80deDJ-1\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u663e\u8457\u5347\u9ad8(\u5747P<0.05)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dU2OS\u7ec6\u80de\u5347\u9ad8\u6700\u4e3a\u663e\u8457(P<0.01)\u3002DJ-1 siRNA\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eU2OS\u7ec6\u80de\u4e2dDJ-1\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u7ec6\u80de\u5b58\u6d3b\u7387\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ec6\u80de\u51cb\u4ea1\u3001\u6291\u5236\u7ec6\u80de\u4fb5\u88ad\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u589e\u52a0PTEN\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73(\u5747P<0.05)\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4e0ehFOB1.19\u7ec6\u80de\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0cPTEN\u5728\u9aa8\u8089\u7624\u7ec6\u80de\u4e2d\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e(P<0.05)\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1aDJ-1\u53ef\u6291\u5236\u4eba\u9aa8\u8089\u7624\u7ec6\u80de\u589e\u6b96\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ec6\u80de\u51cb\u4ea1\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u7ec6\u80de\u4fb5\u88ad\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5176\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u589e\u52a0PTEN\u86cb\u767d\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u6709\u5173\u3002.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that has been shown to improve common symptoms of neurological disorders like depressed mood, fatigue, motor deficits and cognitive dysfunction. tDCS requires daily treatment sessions in order to be effective. We developed a remotely supervised tDCS (RS-tDCS) protocol for participants with multiple sclerosis (MS) to increase accessibility of tDCS, reducing clinician, patient, and caregiver burden. The goal of this protocol is to facilitate home use for larger trials with extended treatment periods. In this study we determine the generalizability of RS-tDCS paired with cognitive training (CT) by testing its feasibility in participants with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nFollowing the methods in our MS protocol development, we enrolled sixteen participants (n\u00a0=\u200912 male, n\u00a0=\u20094 female; mean age 66\u2009years) with PD to complete ten open-label sessions of RS-tDCS paired with CT (2.0\u2009mA\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009min) at home under the remote supervision of a trained study technician. Tolerability data were collected before, during, and after each individual session. Baseline and follow-up measures included symptom inventories (fatigue and sleep) and cognitive assessments.\nRS-tDCS was feasible and tolerable for patients with PD, with at-home access leading to high protocol compliance. Side effects were mostly limited to mild sensations of transient itching and burning under the electrode sites. Similar to prior finding sin MS, we found preliminary efficacy for improvement of fatigue and cognitive processing speed in PD.\nRS-tDCS paired with CT is feasible for participants with PD to receive at home treatment. Signals of benefit for reduced fatigue and improved cognitive processing speed are consistent across the PD and MS samples. RS-tDCS can be generalized to provide tDCS to a range of patients with neurologic disorders for at-home rehabilitation.\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02746705 . Registered April 21st 2016.",

    "abstract": "We previously developed a novel series of vinyl sulfones as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activators with therapeutic potential for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the previously developed lead compound (1) exhibited undesirable druglike properties. Here, we optimized vinyl sulfones by introducing nitrogen heterocycles to improve druglike properties. Among the synthesized compounds, 17e was the most promising drug candidate with good druglike properties. Compound 17e showed superior effects on Nrf2 activation in cell-based assays compared to compound 1 (17e: half-maximal effective concentration (EC",

    "abstract": "After Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent and incidental neurodegenerative disorder, affecting more than 2% of the population older than 65 years old. Since it was first described 200 years ago by Dr James Parkinson, great steps have been made in the understanding of the pathology. However, the cause(s) that initiates and perpetuates the neurodegenerative process is (are) still not clear. Thus, early diagnosis is not available, nor are there efficient therapies that can stop neurodegeneration. PD clinical features are defined by motor (like bradykinesia, resting tremor, gait impairment) and non-motor symptoms (like constipation, apathy, fathigue, olfactory dysfunction, depression and cognitive decline) that get more severe as the disease advances. Neuropathological hallmarks comprise selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and Lewy bodies (LB) in different nuclei of the nervous system. Numerous studies have shown that these pathological features are aggravated by the confluence of other contributing factors, such as a genetic component, exposure to environmental toxins, mitochondrial dysfunction, increase of oxidative stress, calcium imbalance and chronic neuroinflammation, among others. Here, we provide a summary of the actual state of PD's pathology, the most studied molecular mechanisms, classic and novel therapeutic strategies and diagnosis methods, especially highlighting recent advances in these 200 years.",

    "abstract": "Symptomatic treatment options for Parkinson disease have steadily improved, and individualized therapeutic approaches are becoming established for every stage of the disease. However, disease-modifying therapy with a causal approach is still unavailable. The central causative role of alpha-synuclein pathology, including its progressive spread to most areas of the CNS, has been widely recognized, and a strong involvement of immune responses has recently been discovered. New immunologic technologies have been shown to effectively prevent the progression of alpha-synuclein pathology in animal models. These approaches have recently been translated into the first human clinical trials, representing a novel starting point for the causal therapy of Parkinson disease. In this review, the pathomechanistic role of alpha-synuclein and its influence on the surrounding cellular environment are analyzed with a strong focus on immune responses and neuroinflammation. The potential of novel immunotherapeutic approaches that reduce the burden of alpha-synuclein pathology in the CNS is critically evaluated, and currently ongoing human clinical trials are presented. The clinical development of these new immunotherapies is progressing rapidly and gives reason to hope that a causal therapy of Parkinson disease could be possible in the foreseeable future.",

    "abstract": "Aerobic training has a neuroprotective effect in people with Parkinson's disease. Recent evidence indicates that Nordic walking seems a promising alternative due to positive outcomes in functional mobility. However, the effects of Nordic walking compared to free walking on static and functional balance parameters are still unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of nine weeks of Nordic and free walking training on static and functional balance. The sample size was 33 individuals with eight dropouts, leaving 25 individuals in the final sample (Nordic Walking, n=14, Free Walking, n=11). The participants underwent two evaluations in the present randomized clinical trial, pre- and post-training, to determine average velocity and root-mean-square values from center of pressure with eyes open and eyes closed. The functional balance showed approximately 5% improvement for the two groups ( ",

    "abstract": "Background In multiple studies around the globe, non-motor symptoms (NMS) have been identified as a source of immense disability in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there is a scarcity of data from Asia. This is the first study of the Pakistani population to assess the impact of NMS in PD on patients. Objectives To determine the frequency of NMS of PD in the Pakistani population\u00a0and compare it with existing data. Methods In this cross-sectional survey, patient demographics were retrospectively collected from a tertiary care hospital neurology database. This study population comprised 97 patients at different stages of PD who presented to the neurology outpatient department. Disease severity was assessed using the Hoehn and Yahr scale. The NMS questionnaire was employed to identify the presence of NMS. Medical records were reviewed for demographic data and recent treatment history. Results The mean age was 67 years (76.3% of patients had adult onset PD and 23.7% had young onset PD). The NMS with the highest frequencies were nocturia (77.3%), urinary urgency (61.9%), constipation (59.8%), dementia (58.8%), insomnia (52.6%), and orthostatic hypotension (52.6%). The earliest manifestations of NMS were nocturia, forgetfulness, low mood, and orthostatic hypotension. Sleep abnormalities, falling episodes, and hallucinations are prevalent among patients with advanced disease. Conclusion There is a higher frequency of NMS present in the Pakistani population as compared to existing data in other populations.",

    "abstract": "Although evidence and guidelines recommend appropriate rehabilitation from the beginning of diagnosis in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), there is a lack of data addressing the utilization of rehabilitation therapies for these patients in practice. The aim of this study is to investigate the rate of rehabilitation therapy utilization over time in patients with PD using a nationwide cohort in Korea.\nPatients were identified using the registration code for PD in the program for rare, intractable disease from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort database, which consists of 979,390 Korean residents. Data were divided into four periods: 2004-2006, 2007-2009, 2010-2012, and 2013-2015. We assessed the utilization of rehabilitation therapies and the associated patient characteristics.\nThe numbers of patients with PD were 384 in 2004, 855 in 2007, 1,023 in 2010, and 1,222 in 2013. The numbers of physiatrist visits per person were 0.58, 0.96, 1.97, and 2.91, in the respective periods. Among the patients, 35-40% had claims for physical therapy, 16-19% for occupational therapy, and 4-6% for swallowing therapy. There were no remarkable differences between these rates between the study periods. Sex, age, income, disability, and levodopa-equivalent dose were significantly associated with the utilization of rehabilitation therapy.\nThis study demonstrated that the rate of rehabilitation therapy utilization did not change remarkably in patients with PD from 2004 to 2015 in Korea although the number of physiatrist visits increased dramatically. The present evidence and guidelines may have not been adequately integrated into clinical practice during the period of study. Additional efforts may be warranted to provide adequate rehabilitation therapies in clinical practice for patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a frequently occurring condition that resulted from the loss of midbrain neurons, which synthesize the neurotransmitter dopamine. In this study, we established mouse models of PD to investigate the expression of microRNA-128 (miR-128) and mechanism through which it affects apoptosis of dopamine (DA) neurons and the expression of excitatory amino acid transporter 4 (EAAT4) via binding to axis inhibition protein 1 (AXIN1).\nGene expression microarray analysis was performed to screen differentially expressed miRNAs that are associated with PD. The targeting relationship between miR-128 and AXIN1 was verified via a bioinformatics prediction and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. After separation, DA neurons were subjected to a series of inhibitors, activators and shRNAs to validate the mechanisms of miR-128 in controlling of AXIN1 in PD. Positive protein expression of AXIN1 and EAAT4 in DA neurons was determined using immunocytochemistry. miR-128 expression and the mRNA and protein levels of AXIN1 and EAAT4 were evaluated via RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. DA neuron apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL staining.\nWe identified AXIN1 as an upregulated gene in PD based on the microarray data of GSE7621. AXIN1 was targeted and negatively mediated by miR-128. In the DA neurons, upregulated miR-128 expression or sh-AXIN1 increased the positive expression rate of EAAT4 together with mRNA and protein levels, but decreased the mRNA and protein levels of AXIN1, apoptosis rate along with the positive expression rate of AXIN1; however, the opposite trend was found in response to transfection with miR-128 inhibitors.\nEvidence from experimental models revealed that miR-128 might reduce apoptosis of DA neurons while increasing the expression of EAAT4 which might be related to the downregulation of AXIN1. Thus, miR-128 may serve as a potential target for the treatment of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition associated with aging characterized by loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and a reduction in dopamine levels in the striatum. PD is commonly treated using dopamine-replacement medication called levodopa. Levodopa has decreasing efficacy over time. Periods when levodopa is not effective at controlling symptoms of PD are called \"OFF-time\" or \"medication-related motor fluctuations,\" (MRMF). One characteristic of PD is unilateral side of symptom onset. Previous studies have found that side of onset was associated with differential motor and cognitive PD-related symptoms. The main study objective was to examine differences in left and right onset PD patients and OFF-time as measured by the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part IV Sum Score and Part IV item scores.\n64 individuals with mild-moderate PD (age: M(SD)\u202f=\u202f68.72 (8.88)), years with PD: M(SD)\u202f=\u202f6.61 (5.05); Hoehn and Yahr stage Med (1st, 3rd quartile)\u202f=\u202f2.0 (2.0, 3.0) were assessed with the MDS-UPDRS parts I-IV. We conducted two-tailed independent sample t-tests to examine the differences between PD patients with left versus right onset.\nRight onset PD was significantly associated with more overall MRMF (p\u202f=\u202f0.01), more OFF-time (p\u202f=\u202f0.04), greater impact of motor fluctuations on daily life (p\u202f=\u202f0.02) and more complex (unpredictable) MRMF (p\u202f=\u202f0.01).\nPeople with right onset PD have more complications with levodopa treatment. Alternative and/or adjuvant treatments to levodopa may be particularly beneficial for those with right onset PD.",

    "abstract": "Although the genetic load is high in early-onset Parkinson's disease, thorough investigation of the genetic diagnostic yield has yet to be established. The objectives of this study were to assess variants in known genes for PD and other movement disorders and to find new candidates in 50 patients with early-onset PD.\nWe searched for variants either within genes listed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Genetic Nomenclature or rare homozygous variants in novel candidate genes. Further, exome data from 1148 European PD patients (International Parkinson Disease Genomics Consortium) were used for association testing.\nSeven patients (14%) carried pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in Parkin, PLA2G6, or GBA. In addition, rare missense variants in DNAJC13:p.R1830C and in PPM1K:p.Y352C were detected. SPG7:p.A510V and PPM1K:p.Y352C revealed significant association with PD risk (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nAlthough we identified pathogenic variants in 14% of our early-onset PD patients, the majority remain unexplained, and novel candidates need to be validated independently to better further evaluate their role in PD. \u00a9 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Minor hallucinations and well-structured hallucinations are considered in the severity continuum of the psychotic spectrum associated with Parkinson's disease. Although their chronological relationship is largely unknown, the spatial patterns of brain atrophy in these 2 forms of hallucinations partially overlap, suggesting they share similar pathophysiological processes. Functional connectivity studies show that disruption of functional networks involved in perception and attention could be relevant in the emergence of well-structured hallucinations. However, functional neuroimaging studies in patients with isolated minor hallucinations are lacking. The objectives of this study were to explore the structural and functional changes underlying minor hallucinations.\nWe compared patients with (n\u2009=\u200918) and without (n\u2009=\u200914) minor hallucinations using a multimodal structural (gray-matter volume voxel-based morphometry) and functional (seed-to-whole-brain resting-state functional MRI) neuroimaging study.\nCoincident with previously described structural changes in well-structured hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, patients with minor hallucinations exhibited gray-matter atrophy with significant voxel-wise differences in visuoperceptual processing areas and core regions of the default mode network. Functional connectivity changes consisted of altered connectivity within the default mode network, reduced negative correlation with task-positive network, and aberrant connectivity between posterior regions of the default mode network and visual-processing areas. These changes are in accordance with the attentional networks hypothesis proposed for well-structured hallucinations.\nAlthough longitudinal studies are needed to assess the potential role of minor hallucinations as an early clinical biomarker of progression to well-structured hallucinations, the present findings show that the 2 phenomena share similar structural and functional brain correlates. \u00a9 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

Designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs were expressed in different basal ganglia nuclei by stereotactic injections of adeno-associated viral vectors. We compared motor performance, monitored by the open-field and rotarod tests, after random and blinded application of either normal saline or the synthetic receptor activator, clozapine-N-oxide.\nMotor performance, as measured by movement velocity, rotations, and rotarod scores, were significantly improved in PD mice by enhancing the activity of the GPe with Gq custom receptors and by reducing basal ganglia output activity, targeting the output nuclei GPi and SNr with Gi custom receptors.\nOur findings support the hypothesis that enhanced inhibitory output activity of the basal ganglia complex underlie motor signs in PD, and point to the therapeutic potential of chemogenetic based treatments in PD patients. \u00a9 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) may result from damage in the cortex as well as in the dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic inputs to the cortex. Cholinergic inputs to the cortex mainly originate from the basal forebrain and are clustered in several regions, called Ch1 to Ch4, that project to the hippocampus (Ch1-2), the olfactory bulb (Ch3), and the cortex and amygdala (Ch4).\nWe investigated changes in basal forebrain and their role in cognitive deficits in PD.\nWe studied 52 nondemented patients with PD (Hoehn & Yahr 1-2) and 25 age-matched healthy controls using diffusion and resting state functional MRI.\nPD patients had a loss of structural integrity within the Ch1-2 and Ch3-4 nuclei of the basal forebrain as well as in the fornix. Tractography showed that the probability of anatomical connection was decreased in PD between Ch3-4 and the associative prefrontal cortex, occipital cortex, and peri-insular regions. There was a reduction in functional connectivity between Ch1-2 and the bilateral hippocampi and parahippocampal gyri, the left middle and superior temporal gyri, and the left fusiform gyrus and between Ch3-4 and the right inferior frontal gyrus and the right and left thalamus. In Ch1-2, loss of structural integrity and connectivity correlated with scores at the memory tests, whereas changes in Ch3-4 correlated with scores of global cognition and executive functions.\nThis study highlights the association between deficits of different cholinergic nuclei of the basal forebrain and the extent of cognitive impairments in nondemented PD patients. \u00a9 2018 The Authors.

    "abstract": "The G2019S mutation of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the molecular mechanisms of LRRK2 mutation contributing to the onset and progression of PD have not been fully illustrated. We generated HEK293 cells stably transfected with \u03b1-synuclein and investigated the effect of LRRK2 G2019S mutation on the degradation of \u03b1-synuclein. The lysosomal activity was assessed by the protein degradation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ribonuclease A. It was found that \u03b1-synuclein was mainly degraded in lysosomes. LRRK2 G2019S inhibited the degradation of \u03b1-synuclein, and promoted its aggregation. LRRK2 G2019S also decreased the activities of lysosomal enzymes including cathepsin B and cathepsin L. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of LRRK2 G2019S on lysosomal functions did not depend on its kinase activity. These findings indicated that the inhibitory effect of LRRK2 G2019S on \u03b1-synuclein degradation could underlie the pathogenesis of aberrant \u03b1-synuclein aggregation in PD with LRRK2 mutation.",

    "abstract": "IRL790 is a novel compound with psychomotor stabilizing properties primarily targeting the dopamine D3 receptor. IRL790 is developed as an experimental treatment for levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), impulse control disorder, and psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). The primary objective was to investigate the safety and tolerability of IRL790 in PD patients with LID in a randomized controlled trial. PD patients with peak-dose dyskinesia were randomized to placebo or IRL790 treatment (1:3 ratio) for 4 weeks. Study drug was given as an adjunct treatment to the patients' regular stable antiparkinsonian medication. Dosing was individually titrated for 14 days, whereafter dosing was kept stable for an additional 14 days. Fifteen patients were randomized to treatment and 13 patients completed the 4-week treatment. Adverse events were mostly reported during the titration phase of the trial. They were mainly central nervous system related and could be mitigated by dose adjustments. There were no serious adverse events. There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory parameters due to the treatment. The average dose in the stable dose phase was 18\u2009mg daily, yielding a 2-h post-dose plasma concentration of average 229\u2009nM on day 28. Assessments for motor function showed a numeric reduction in dyskinesia. It is concluded that IRL790 can be safely administered to patients with advanced PD. The results will be of guidance for the design of phase 2 studies.",

    "abstract": "Difficulty with emotion recognition is increasingly being recognized as a symptom of Parkinson's disease. Most research into this area contends that progressive cognitive decline accompanying the disease is to be blamed. However, facial mimicry (i.e., the involuntary congruent activation of facial expression muscles upon viewing a particular facial expression) might also play a role and has been relatively understudied in this clinical population. In healthy participants, facial mimicry has been shown to improve recognition of observed emotions, a phenomenon described by embodied simulation theory. Due to motor disturbances, Parkinson's disease patients frequently show reduced emotional expressiveness, which translates into reduced mimicry. Therefore, it is likely that facial mimicry problems in Parkinson's disease contribute at least partly to the emotional recognition deficits that these patients experience and might greatly influence their social cognition abilities and quality of life. The present review aims to highlight the need for further inquiry into the motor mechanisms behind emotional recognition in Parkinson's disease by synthesizing behavioural, physiological, and neuroanatomical evidence.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. While age is the most significant risk factor, the exact cause of this disease and the most effective approaches to mitigation remain unclear. It has long been proposed that dopamine may play a role in the pathology of Parkinson's disease in view of its ability to generate both protein-modifying quinones such as aminochrome and reactive oxygen species, especially in the presence of pathological iron accumulation in the primary site of neuron loss. Given the clinically measured acidosis of ",

    "abstract": "We report a successful bilateral globus pallidus internus-deep brain stimulation (GPi-DBS) for a Parkinson disease (PD) patient with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) and an unusually long anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line. A 54-year-old man presented with a history of 3 months of severe shuffling gait, rigidity, slow movements of the left side limbs, and difficulty managing finances. A brain MRI revealed marked ventriculomegaly (Evans index = 0.42). The patient was diagnosed with INPH and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Cognitive impairment improved, but walking disturbances, slowness, and rigidity persisted. Then treatment with levodopa was added, and the patient experienced a sustained improvement. He was diagnosed with PD. After 7 years, the patient developed gait freezing and severe levodopa-induced dyskinesia. The patient underwent bilateral GPi-DBS. We used MRI/CT fusion techniques for anatomical indirect targeting. Indirect targeting is based on standardized stereotactic atlas and on a formula-derived method based on AC-PC landmarks. The AC-PC line was 40 mm (the usual length is between 19 and 32 mm). Intraoperative microelectrode recording was a non-expendable test, but multiple recordings were avoided to reduce the surgical risk of ventricular involvement. There was a 71% decrease in the UPDRS III score during the on-stimulation state (28 to 8). The patient's dyskinesias resolved dramatically with a UdysRS of 15 (88% improvement) during the on-stimulation condition. The observed motor benefits and the improvement of his daily activities have persisted 6 months after surgery. Deep brain stimulation surgery in PD with ventriculomegaly is a challenge. This procedure can result in a greater chance of breaching the ventricle, with risks of intraventricular hemorrhage and migration of cerebrospinal fluid into the brain parenchyma with target displacement. Furthermore, clinical judgment is paramount when recent onset of shuffling gait coexists with ventriculomegaly because the most common dilemma is differentiating between PD and INPH. For these reasons, neurologists and surgeons may refuse to operate on PD patients with ventriculomegaly. However, DBS should be considered for PD patients with motor complications when responsiveness to levodopa is demonstrated, even in the context of marked ventriculomegaly.",

    "abstract": "Research has shown that dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with better attention performance and with motor symptom severity. In the current study, we aimed to investigate dFC of both the default mode network (DMN) and the frontoparietal network (FPN) as neural correlates of cognitive functioning in patients with PD. Additionally, we investigated pain and motor problems as symptoms of PD in relation to dFC. Twenty-four PD patients and 27 healthy controls participated in this study. Memory and executive functioning were assessed with neuropsychological tests. Pain was assessed with the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS); motor symptom severity was assessed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). All subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), from which dFC was defined by calculating the variability of functional connectivity over a number of sliding windows within each scan. dFC of both the DMN and FPN with the rest of the brain was calculated. Patients performed worse on tests of visuospatial memory, verbal memory and working memory. No difference existed between groups regarding dFC of the DMN nor the FPN with the rest of the brain. A positive correlation existed between dFC of the DMN and visuospatial memory. Our results suggest that dynamics during the resting state are a neural correlate of visuospatial memory in PD patients. Furthermore, we suggest that brain dynamics of the DMN, as measured with dFC, could be a phenomenon specifically linked to cognitive functioning in PD, but not to other symptoms.",

The EOFOG group had a later age at onset of motor symptoms. There were no significant differences observed in the NMS, with the exception of fatigue in EOFOG.\nFOG is associated with longer disease duration and higher severity of disease.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is common, age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder caused by a severe loss of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Given the projected increase in the number of people with PD over the coming decades, interventions aimed at minimizing morbidity and improve quality of life are crucial. There is currently no fully proven pharmacological therapy that can modify or slow the disease progression. Physical activity (PA) can complement pharmacological therapy to manage the inherent decline associated with the disease. The evidence indicates that upregulation of neurotrophins and nerve growth factors are potentially critical mediators of the beneficial effects associated with PA. Accumulating evidence suggests that patients with PD might benefit from PA in a number of ways, from general improvements in health to disease-specific effects and potentially, disease-modifying effects. Various forms of PA that have shown beneficial effects in PD include - aerobic exercises, treadmill training, dancing, traditional Chinese exercise, yoga, and resistance training. In this review, we explored available research that addresses the impact of exercise and PA on PD. The original articles with randomized control trials, prospective cohort studies, longitudinal studies, meta-analysis, and relevant review articles from 2005 to 2017 were selected for the present review. Many gaps remain in our understanding of the most effective exercise intervention for PD symptoms, the mechanisms underlying exercise-induced changes and the best way to monitor response to therapy. However, available research suggests that exercise is a promising, cost-effective, and low-risk intervention to improve both motor and nonmotor symptoms in patients with PD. Thus, PA should be prescribed and encouraged in all PD patients.",

    "abstract": "The underlying mechanisms of Parkinson\u00b4s disease are not completely revealed. Especially, early diagnostic biomarkers are lacking. To characterize early pathophysiological events, research is focusing on metabolomics. In this case-control study we investigated the metabolic profile of 31 Parkinson\u00b4s disease-patients in comparison to 95 neurologically healthy controls. The investigation of metabolites in CSF was performed by a 12 Tesla SolariX Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometer (FT-ICR-MS). Multivariate statistical analysis sorted the most important biomarkers in relation to their ability to differentiate Parkinson versus control. The affected metabolites, their connection and their conversion pathways are described by means of network analysis. The metabolic profiling by FT-ICR-MS in CSF yielded in a good group separation, giving insights into the disease mechanisms. A total number of 243 metabolites showed an affected intensity in Parkinson\u00b4s disease, whereas 15 of these metabolites seem to be the main biological contributors. The network analysis showed a connection to the tricarboxylic cycle (TCA cycle) and therefore to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress within mitochondria. The metabolomic analysis of CSF in Parkinson\u00b4s disease showed an association to pathways which are involved in lipid/ fatty acid metabolism, energy metabolism, glutathione metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Previously we identified the p.Thr61Ile mutation in coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 2 (CHCHD2) in a Chinese family with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease. But the mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we explored the effects of CHCHD2 p.Thr61Ile mutation in cells and its association with coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 10 (CHCHD10). We found that overexpression of Parkinson's disease-associated T61I mutant CHCHD2 did not produce mitochondrial dysfunction. Rather, its protective effect from stress was abrogated. And, the level of the CHCHD2 protein and mRNA in patient fibroblasts was not significantly different from control. In addition, CHCHD2 T61I mutation caused increased interaction with CHCHD10 and reduced CHCHD10 level. The mitochondrial ultrastructural alterations in CHCHD2 T61I mutant patient fibroblasts are similar to that of CHCHD10 mutations. We therefore propose that CHCHD10 is involved in the development of Parkinson's disease caused by CHCHD2 loss-of-function mutation p.T61I.",

    "abstract": "Bone loss is a non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). It is unclear whether a patient's immobility or the endocrine changes in the body causes bone deterioration. To address this issue, we used an animal model of the disease where Swiss albino mice were injected with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) on day 1 and were left untreated for eight weeks. Behavioral phenotypes of PD, and striatal acetylcholinesterase and dopamine levels were measured. Cortical and trabecular bones were assessed by \u03bc-CT and histology. Gene expression studies were done through quantitative real-time PCR. Effect of MPP+ and MPTP-treated mice serum on MC3T3E-1, SH-SY5Y, and primary osteoclast cells were also studied. Our results demonstrated that MPTP treatment leads to PD like symptoms. It shows a loss of trabecular bone mass and quality by decreasing osteoblast and increased osteoclast number and activity. This effect was accompanied by reduced osteogenic and elevated osteoclastogenic genes expression. While MPP+ had a cytotoxic effect on dopaminergic neurons, it did not affect bone cells. However, ex-vivo treatment of the serum from MPTP-treated mice decreased osteoblastogenesis and increased osteoclastogenesis in cell culture. In conclusion, our study suggests that MPTP-induced parkinsonian features in mice leads to trabecular bone loss by decreased bone formation and increased bone resorption due to changes in the serum circulating factors. This study characterizes the microarchitectural and cellular changes in the skeleton of a mouse model of PD that can be further utilized to investigate therapeutic avenues to treat bone loss in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Postural control asymmetry is an important aspect of Parkinson's disease (PD) that may be associated with falls. The aim of this study was to compare the postural control asymmetry during postural tasks between fallers and non-fallers in people with PD and neurological healthy age-matched controls (CG). Individuals with idiopathic PD (n\u202f=\u202f24) and CG (n\u202f=\u202f24) were sub-divided into groups of fallers and non-fallers based on their fall history over the past year. Participants performed blocks of three 30-s trials of quiet standing with feet in a side-by-side and semi-tandem stance position. The center of pressure parameters for each limb were measured and used to calculate the symmetry index. Fallers compared to non-fallers had decreased asymmetry of vertical force in the side-by-side condition. During the tandem-front leg condition, PD non-fallers increased asymmetry of the medial-lateral velocity of sway compared to CG non-fallers. In addition, for the tandem-back leg condition, PD non-fallers increased asymmetry of total displacement and medial-lateral root mean square and mean velocity of sway compared to PD fallers. The results of the study did not support the hypothesis that PD fallers are more asymmetric than PD non-fallers. On the contrary, our results indicated that PD non-fallers had higher postural control asymmetry, especially during the more challenging (semi-tandem standing) postural task.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenic mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease (PD)/parkinsonism affect mitochondrial and endolysosomal trafficking. The retromer is required to retrieve some proteins from endosomes to the Golgi and plasma membrane. Here, we discuss how retromer-dependent retrieval also affects ceramide metabolism. Compelling studies across PD models in Drosophila and mammalian neurons reveal a pathogenic cascade implicating retromer dysfunction and mitochondrial defects. We argue that ceramides may play a critical role in the pathobiology based on the studies of PLA2G6 and VPS35 in Drosophila mutants and human knock-down cells. In addition, pathogenic variants in many lysosomal storage disorder genes have recently been associated with PD, suggesting a potential overlap between the pathogenic mechanisms underlying these disorders. We propose that disruption of ceramide metabolism may affect endolysosomal and mitochondrial function, and plays an important role in PD/parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "Brain atrophy frequently occurs with Parkinson's disease (PD) and relates to increased motor symptoms of PD. The predictive value of neuroimaging-based measures of global and regional brain volume on motor outcomes in deep brain stimulation (DBS) remains unclear but potentially could improve patient selection and targeting.\nTo determine the predictive value of preoperative volumetric MRI measures of cortical and subcortical brain volume on motor outcomes of subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS in PD.\nPreoperative T1 3D MP-RAGE structural brain MRI images were analyzed for each participant to determine subcortical, ventricular, and cortical volume and thickness. Change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores for subsection 3, representing motor outcomes, was computed preoperatively and postoperatively following DBS programming in 86 participants. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between volumetric data and the effect of DBS on UPDRS 3 scores.\nLarger ventricular and smaller thalamic volumes predicted significantly less improvement of UPDRS 3 scores after STN DBS.\nOur findings demonstrate in PD that regional brain volumes, in particular thalamic and ventricular volumes, predict motor outcomes after DBS. Differences in regional brain volumes may alter electrode targeting, reflect a specific disease trait such as postoperative progression of subclinical dementia, or directly interfere with the action of DBS.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S) pathologically impacts the brain, a highly lipid-rich organ. We investigated how alterations in \u03b1S or lipid/fatty\u00a0acid homeostasis affect each other. Lipidomic profiling of human \u03b1S-expressing yeast revealed increases in oleic acid (OA, 18:1), diglycerides, and triglycerides. These findings were recapitulated in rodent and human neuronal models of \u03b1S dyshomeostasis (overexpression; patient-derived triplication or E46K mutation; E46K mice). Preventing lipid droplet formation or augmenting OA increased \u03b1S yeast toxicity; suppressing the OA-generating enzyme stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD) was protective. Genetic or pharmacological SCD inhibition ameliorated toxicity in \u03b1S-overexpressing rat neurons. In a C.\u00a0elegans model, SCD knockout prevented \u03b1S-induced dopaminergic degeneration. Conversely, we observed detrimental effects of OA on \u03b1S homeostasis: in human neural cells, excess OA caused \u03b1S inclusion formation, which was reversed by SCD inhibition. Thus, monounsaturated fatty acid metabolism is pivotal for \u03b1S-induced neurotoxicity, and inhibiting SCD represents a novel PD therapeutic approach.",

    "abstract": "The Nigrosome-1 and putaminal hypointensity depicted on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), and midbrain atrophy assessed on T1-weighted are some of the most common radiological parameters to diagnose Parkinsonism at Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging. Our aim is to assess the feasibility of these signs in the differentiation of Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients versus disease (DC) and healthy controls (HC) and in the assessment of the Atypical Progressive Parkinsonisms (APPs).\nPresence or loss of the Nigrosome-1 was assessed retrospectively on multiple-echo SWI obtained on a 3\u2009T scan by two neuroradiologists. Results were compared with the 123I-FP-CIT SPECT images. Morphologic diagnostic features suggestive of APPs such as midbrain atrophy and putaminal hypointensity were evaluated by qualitative scores. The midbrain and putaminal scores were summed (combined score) and then added to the Nigrosome-1 score (global score).\nThe study included 126 patients with IPD (n\u2009=\u200956), APPs patients (n\u2009=\u200930; 18 PSP, 3 MSA-C, 9 MSA-P), 16 DC and 24 HC. Sensitivity and specificity of the Nigrosome-1 in discriminating IPD from controls were 96,43% and 85.00%, APPs from controls were 100% and 85%, IPD from APPs were 96,43% and 0% respectively. Combined score for midbrain atrophy and putaminal hypointensity resulted in the most accurate for distinguishing APPs from IPD with a value of \u2265 2 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.98).\nNigrosome-1 is a valid tool to differentiate IPD-APPs from controls. The combined score of midbrain atrophy and putaminal hypointensity represents a valid diagnostic pointer in the differential diagnosis of APPs from IPD.",

    "abstract": "To quantify dopaminergic neurodegeneration and iron overload in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) to evaluate Parkinson's disease (PD) using both quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and neuromelanin imaging.\nWe studied 39 PD patients (PD group) and 25 healthy controls (HC group) who underwent brain MRI with QSM and neuromelanin imaging. QSM and neuromelanin values of the SNpc were obtained using a voxel-based automated region segmentation system. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the SNpc in the neuromelanin images was calculated based on the mean value for the background region. The neuromelanin value was defined as the neuromelanin volume with an SNR higher than that of the background. The significance of the intergroup differences, and according to the severity stages in the PD group was tested for each QSM and neuromelanin value. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for diagnosing PD was performed for QSM and neuromelanin values.\nThe QSM value was significantly higher in the PD group than in the HC group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The neuromelanin value was significantly smaller in the PD group than in the HC group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The areas under the ROC curve were 0.68 and 0.86 for QSM and neuromelanin values, respectively. Using QSM and neuromelanin imaging to classify the PD stage was difficult.\nQuantifying the SNpc alterations with our region-based approach is useful for the diagnosis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease associated with motor problems such as gait impairment. Different systems based on 3D cameras, accelerometers or gyroscopes have been used in related works in order to study gait disturbances in PD. Kinect \nIn this work, we have built a Kinect-based system that can distinguish between different PD stages, and have performed a clinical study with 30 patients suffering from PD belonging to three groups: early PD patients without axial impairment, more evolved PD patients with higher gait impairment but without Freezing of Gait (FoG), and patients with advanced PD and FoG. Those patients were recorded by two Kinect devices when they were walking in a hospital corridor. The datasets obtained from the Kinect were preprocessed, 115 features identified, some methods were applied to select the relevant features (correlation based feature selection, information gain, and consistency subset evaluation), and different classification methods (decision trees, Bayesian networks, neural networks and K-nearest neighbours classifiers) were evaluated with the goal of finding the most accurate method for PD stage classification.\nThe classifier that provided the best results is a particular case of a Bayesian Network classifier (similar to a Na\u00efve Bayesian classifier) built from a set of 7 relevant features selected by the correlation-based on feature selection method. The accuracy obtained for that classifier using 10-fold cross validation is 93.40%. The relevant features are related to left shin angles, left humerus angles, frontal and lateral bents, left forearm angles and the number of steps during spin.\nIn this paper, it is shown that using Kinect is adequate to build a inexpensive and comfortable system that classifies PD into three different stages related to FoG. Compared to the results of previous works, the obtained accuracy (93.40%) can be considered high. The relevant features for the classifier are: a) movement and position of the left arm, b) trunk position for slightly displaced walking sequences, and c) left shin angle, for straight walking sequences. However, we have obtained a better accuracy (96.23%) for a classifier that only uses features extracted from slightly displaced walking steps and spin walking steps. Finally, the obtained set of relevant features may lead to new rehabilitation therapies for PD patients with gait problems.",

    "abstract": "A large number of case-control studies have investigated the association of apolipoprotein E ( APOE) polymorphisms with Parkinson disease (PD) and Parkinson disease dementia (PDD), with inconsistent results. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the relationship between APOE polymorphisms and PD/PDD risk. We searched for published studies in PubMed, Web of Science, WanFang Data (in Chinese), and CNKI (in Chinese) from inception to June 2017. Case-control studies reporting part or complete APOE genotype and allele frequency data were included. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using RevMan 5.3 software. A total of 39 studies involving 6453 cases with PD, with 461 cases with PDD, and 6855 controls were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that the APOE \u03b53 allele was a protective factor for PD (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.81-0.99; P = .04), whereas no significant differences in PD risk among all cases compared to controls were found for APOE \u03b52 and \u03b54. In Asian subgroups, the APOE \u03b54 allele was shown to be a risk factor for PD (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01-1.46; P = .04). Additionally, APOE polymorphisms were significantly associated with PDD risk in the entire case group (\u03b53: OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.58-0.89, P = .003; \u03b54: OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.12-1.88, P = .004) and in Asian subgroups.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the contribution of nigral dopaminergic (DA) cell loss, repeated exposure to DA medication and the combination of both to the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). A bilateral 6-OHDA lesion of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) was performed in rats. A set of animals was repeatedly administered with L-dopa (20\u2009mg/kg/day) and benserazide (5\u2009mg/kg/day) over 10 days starting from day 11 post-lesion. Behavioural testing was performed in week 3 post-lesion: novel object recognition (NOR), elevated plus maze (EPM) social interaction (SI) tests, and amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion (AIH). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant partial lesion (48%) in 6-OHDA versus sham rats. This lesion was not associated with motor impairment. However, lesioned rats displayed a significant deficit in the NOR, which was reversed by acute treatment with l-dopa/benserazide (12.5\u2009mg/kg and 15\u2009mg/kg respectively). Lesioned rats also displayed a deficit in the EPM which was not reversed by acute treatment with l-dopa. No difference was observed in the SI test or in the AIH assay. In all assays, no effect of chronic l-dopa exposure was observed. This study provides new insights into the neuropathophysiology associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD. Our data strongly emphasises a not previously clearly identified critical role in cognition for the SNc. The results suggest that DA pathways were less directly involved in lesion-induced anxiety-like behaviour. We did not report any effect of chronic l-dopa exposure in the context of partial nigral cell loss.",

    "abstract": "GBA1 gene encodes for the lysosomal membrane protein glucocerebrosidase (GCase). GBA1 heterozygous mutations profoundly impair GCase activity and are currently recognized as an important risk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Deficits in lysosomal degradation pathways may contribute to pathological \u03b1-synuclein accumulation, thereby favoring dopaminergic neuron degeneration and associated microglial activation. However, the precise mechanisms by which GCase deficiency may influence PD onset and progression remain unclear. In this work we used conduritol-\u03b2-epoxide (CBE), a potent inhibitor of GCase, to induce a partial, systemic defect of GCase activity comparable to that associated with heterozygous GBA1 mutations, in mice. Chronic (28\u202fdays) administration of CBE (50\u202fmg/kg, i.p.) was combined with administration of a classic PD-like inducing neurotoxin, such as MPTP (30\u202fmg/kg, i.p. for 5\u202fdays). The aim was to investigate whether a pre-existing GCase defect may influence the effects of MPTP in terms of nigrostriatal damage, microglia activation and \u03b1-synuclein accumulation. Pre-treatment with CBE had tendency to enhance MPTP-induced neurodegeneration in striatum and caused significant increase of total \u03b1-synuclein expression in substantia nigra. Microglia was remarkably activated by CBE alone, without further increases when combined with MPTP. Overall, we propose this model as an additional tool to study pathophysiological processes of PD in the presence of GCase defects.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel Bayesian adaptive dual controller (ADC) for autonomously programming deep brain stimulation devices. We evaluated the Bayesian ADC's performance in the context of reducing beta power in a computational model of Parkinson's disease, in which it was tasked with finding the set of stimulation parameters which optimally reduced beta power as fast as possible. Here, the Bayesian ADC has dual goals: (a) to minimize beta power by exploiting the best parameters found so far, and (b) to explore the space to find better parameters, thus allowing for better control in the future. The Bayesian ADC is composed of two parts: an inner parameterized feedback stimulator and an outer parameter adjustment loop. The inner loop operates on a short time scale, delivering stimulus based upon the phase and power of the beta oscillation. The outer loop operates on a long time scale, observing the effects of the stimulation parameters and using Bayesian optimization to intelligently select new parameters to minimize the beta power. We show that the Bayesian ADC can efficiently optimize stimulation parameters, and is superior to other optimization algorithms. The Bayesian ADC provides a robust and general framework for tuning stimulation parameters, can be adapted to use any feedback signal, and is applicable across diseases and stimulator designs.",

    "abstract": "The canonical Wnt pathway is critical for both the development and adulthood survival and homeostatic maintenance of the midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Expanding evidence has demonstrated that genetic factors associated with familial Parkinson disease (PD) deregulate this important pathway, suggesting that a disturbed canonical Wnt pathway is likely involved in PD pathogenesis; yet, the specific role of this pathway in sporadic PD remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of specific inhibition of the canonical pathway by hemizygous knockout of \u03b2-catenin, the obligatory component of the canonical Wnt pathway, on paraquat (PQ)-induced DA neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra in vivo. We found that while hemizygous conditional knockout of \u03b2-catenin in DA neurons did not cause any significant TH+ neuronal loss in the substantia nigra at basal level, it triggered elevated oxidative stress at basal level and further enhanced PQ-induced oxidative damage and loss of TH+ neurons in the substantia nigra and axonal termini in the striatum that manifested as exacerbated motor deficits. These data support the notion that reduced Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in sporadic PD likely contributes to DA neuronal loss through an enhanced oxidative stress-response pathway.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is marked by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (DAN) accompanied by glial activation. Thus, inhibiting glial activation that occurs during this disease could be an effective method for treating PD. Optimized Yinxieling Formula (OYF), a Chinese medicinal formula, which is used to efficiently treat autoimmune disease psoriasis, has been proved to display potential immunomodulatory effects in inflammation-associated diseases. This study assessed the therapeutic benefits of OYF on glial-mediated neuroinflammation and neuroprotection in PD models ",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of impulsivity in Parkinson's disease appears as an arduous side effect of dopaminergic therapy with potentially detrimental consequences for the life of the patients. Although conceptualized as a result of non-physiologic chronic dopaminergic stimulation, recent advances speculate on combined disruption of other networks as well. In the search for neuroanatomical correlates of this multifaceted disturbance, this study employs two distinct, well-defined tasks of close association to motor inhibition and decision-making impulsivity, Go/No Go and Delay discounting. The fMRI and functional connectivity analysis in 21 Parkinson's disease patients, including 8 patients suffering from severe impulse control disorder, and 28 healthy controls, revealed in impulsive Parkinson's disease patients not only decreased fMRI activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral striatum, but also vast functional connectivity changes of both caudate nuclei as decreased connectivity to the superior parietal cortex and increased connectivity to the insular area, clearly beyond the commonly stated areas, which indicates that orbitofronto-striatal and mesolimbic functional disruptions are not the sole mechanisms underlying impulse control disorder in Parkinson's disease. Ergo, our results present a refinement and synthesis of gradually developing ideas about the nature of impulsive control disorder in Parkinson's disease-an umbrella term encompassing various behavioral deviations related to distinct neuronal networks and presumably neurotransmitter systems, which greatly exceed the previously envisioned dopaminergic pathways as the only culprit.",

    "abstract": "The oral antidiabetic drug metformin is known to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties through activation of AMP kinase, thus protecting various brain tissues as cortical neurons, for example. However, the effect of metformin on the substantia nigra (SN), the main structure affected in Parkinson's disease (PD), has not yet been studied in depth. Inflammation is a key feature of PD and it may play a central role in the neurodegeneration that takes place in this disorder. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of metformin on the microglial activation of the SN of rats using the animal model of PD based on the injection of the pro-inflammogen lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

    "abstract": "Postural instability is common in Parkinson's disease (PD), often contributing to falls, injuries, and reduced mobility. In the clinical setting, balance disorder is commonly diagnosed using clinical tests and balance scales, but it is suggested that the most sensitive measurement is the force platform. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the methods and various posturographic procedures used to assess the body balance and gait in PD. A systematic review was conducted of papers published from 2000 to 2017. Databases searched were PubMed and EBSCO. Studies must have involved patients with PD, used force platform or motion analysis system as a measurement tool, and described posturographic procedure. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. A total of 32 studies met the inclusion criteria. The PEDro scores ranged from 5 to 7 points. The analysis of the objective methods assessing balance disorders revealed a large discrepancy in the duration and procedures of measurements. The number of repetitions of each trial fluctuated between 1 and 8, and the duration of a single trial ranged from 10 to 60 seconds. Overall, there are many scales and tests used to assess the balance disorders and disabilities of people with PD. Although in many included studies the authors have used posturography as a method to evaluate the postural instability of PD patients, the results are contradictory. To solve this issue, it is indicated to establish a \"gold standard\" of procedures of measures of balance.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes are age-dependent multifactorial neurodegenerative diseases, which are clinically characterized by bradykinesia, tremor, muscle rigidity and postural instability. Although these diseases share several common clinical phenotypes, their pathophysiological aspects vary among the disease categories. Extensive animal-based approaches, as well as postmortem studies, have provided important insights into the disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. However, the exact pathological mechanisms triggering such diseases still remain elusive. Furthermore, the effects of drugs observed in animal models are not always reproduced in human clinical trials. By using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, it has become possible to establish patient-specific iPSCs from their somatic cells and to effectively differentiate these iPSCs into different types of neurons, reproducing some key aspects of the disease phenotypes in vitro. In this review, we summarize recent findings from iPSC-based modeling of PD and several atypical parkinsonian syndromes including multiple system atrophy, frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 and Perry syndrome. Furthermore, we discuss future challenges and prospects for modeling and understanding PD and atypical parkinsonian syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Commonalities and, in some cases, pathological overlap between neurodegenerative diseases have led to speculation that targeting of underlying mechanisms might be of potentially shared therapeutic benefit. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the formation of plaques, composed primarily of the amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 (A\u03b2) peptide in the brain, resulting in neurodegeneration. Previously, we have shown that overexpression of the lysosomal-trafficking protein, human Vps41 (hVps41), is neuroprotective in a transgenic worm model of Parkinson's disease, wherein progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration is induced by \u03b1-synuclein overexpression. Here, we report the results of a systematic comparison of hVps41-mediated neuroprotection between \u03b1-synuclein and A\u03b2 in transgenic nematode models of Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results indicate that an ARF-like GTPase gene product, ARL-8, mitigates endocytic A\u03b2 neurodegeneration in a VPS-41-dependent manner, rather than through RAB-7 and AP3 as with \u03b1-synuclein. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of ARL-8 or hVps41 appears to be dependent on their colocalization and the activity of ARL-8. Additionally, we demonstrate that the LC3 orthologue, LGG-2, plays a critical role in A\u03b2 toxicity with ARL-8. Further analysis of functional effectors of A\u03b2 protein processing via the lysosomal pathway will assist in the elucidation of the underlying mechanism involving VPS-41-mediated neuroprotection. These results reveal functional distinctions in the intracellular management of neurotoxic proteins that serve to better inform the path for development of therapeutic interventions to halt neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "To date the LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation remains the most common genetic cause of Parkinson disease (PD) worldwide. It accounts for up to 6% of familial and approximately 1.5% of sporadic cases. LRRK2 has a kinase enzymatic domain which provides an attractive potential target for drug therapies and LRRK2 kinase inhibitors are in development. Prevalence of the p.G2019S has a variable ethnic and geographic distribution, the highest reported among Ashkenazi Jews (30% in patients with familial PD, 14% in sporadic PD, 2.0% in controls) and North African Berbers (37% in patients with familial PD, 41% in sporadic PD, and 1% in controls). Little is known about the frequency of the LRRK2 p.G2019S among populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Our group and others previously reported that the p.G2019S is absent in a small cohort of Nigerian PD patients and controls. Here we used Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assay to screen for the p.G2019S in a larger cohort of Black African PD patients (n = 126) and healthy controls (n = 54) from Nigeria. Our analysis confirmed that all patients and controls are negative for the p.G2019S mutation. This report provides further evidence that the LRRK2 p.G2019S is not implicated in PD in black populations from Nigeria and support the notion that p.G2019S mutation originated after the early human dispersal from sub-Saharan Africa. Further studies using larger cohorts and advance sequencing technology are required to underpin the genetic causes of PD in this region.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), the identification of instrumental biomarkers is crucial to evaluate disease susceptibility and motor stage. We evaluated self-similarity of electrocortical activity as expression of brain signal complexity in untreated PD, to investigate its possible role as a neurophysiological biomarker. We analyzed the data of 34 untreated PD subjects and 18 group-matched controls who underwent standardized electroencephalography. A Welch's periodogram was applied to site-specific electroencephalographic signal epochs. To investigate self-similarity of electrocortical activity, the power law exponent \u03b2 was computed for each selected coordinate. In both PD subjects and controls, \u03b2 values at each coordinate increased with an antero-posterior gradient, changing from values around one in fronto-temporal sites to values around two among parieto-occipital sites. PD subjects presented overall lower \u03b2 values among different sites compared to controls, with significant differences for the left fronto-temporal sites. Our findings suggest an increased level of fronto-temporal neuronal organization in untreated PD. We hypothesize a possible role of \u03b2 as a neurophysiological biomarker for early untreated PD.",

    "abstract": "The in vivo diagnosis of synucleinopathies is an important research aim since clinical diagnostic criteria show low accuracy. The skin innervation, especially the autonomic subdivision, is a useful region to search for abnormal \u03b1-syn aggregates in synucleinopathies since the peripheral sympathetic nerves can be the earliest-affected neural region and autonomic symptoms may precede the classical symptoms of these disorders.\nThe major advantages of skin biopsy as an in vivo diagnostic tool for synucleinopathies are that it is an inexpensive and easy-to-perform technique requiring only limited facilities, and that it is repeatable in long-term studies as it causes only minor discomfort to the patient.\nThis review analyzes current progress in this area of research that may facilitate the standardization of this method, potentially eliminating differences among laboratories in the implementation of the method.\nThe most suitable and commonly used technique for identifying in vivo \u03b1-syn aggregates in skin nerves is indirect immunofluorescence, although several aspects of this approach need to be standardized, particularly when synucleinopathies without autonomic failure present a patchy distribution of abnormal \u03b1-syn aggregates in skin nerves. By contrast, synucleinopathies with autonomic failure may present widespread diffusion of abnormal aggregates in autonomic skin nerves.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene have been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Several variants in the gene have been identified as risk factors for the development of PD, but there is difference in the prevalence of this mutation in various ethnic groups and countries. There is no published study related to this field on the Indian population.\nThe aim of the study was to investigate the frequency of mutations in the GBA gene in Indian patients with PD.\nTo perform the mutation analysis of the GBA gene, we amplified its entire coding region, spanning 11 exons and intron/exon junctions in three fragments, with a set of three primer pairs using the long polymerase chain reaction enzyme mix from Fermentas, Canada.\nWe screened a total of 100 PD patients for mutations in the GBA gene. The sequence analysis identified the following five variants in this gene: IVS1 + 191G > C, IVS4 + 47G > A (rs. 2075569), IVS6 - 86A > G (rs. 114099990), IVS9 + 141A > G (rs. 28373017), and IVS10 + 3G > A. Of these, two variants IVS1 + 191G > C and IVS10 + 3G > A are novel, and the remaining three are known variants reported in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP). All the known variants were detected in homozygous as well as in heterozygous states. Both novel variants were identified in only one patient in a heterozygous state.\nGBA mutation may not be so common in Indian patients with PD as compared to the other ethnic populations. These findings need to be confirmed in larger studies.",

    "abstract": "To assess white matter integrity in patients with essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson disease (PD) with moderate to severe motor impairment.\nSedated participants with ET (n = 57) or PD (n = 99) underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity values were computed. White matter tracts were defined using 3 well-described atlases. To determine candidate white matter regions that differ between ET and PD groups, a bootstrapping analysis was applied using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Linear regression was applied to assess magnitude and direction of differences in DTI metrics between ET and PD populations in the candidate regions.\nFractional anisotropy values that differentiate ET from PD localize primarily to thalamic and visual-related pathways, while diffusivity differences localized to the cerebellar peduncles. Patients with ET exhibited lower fractional anisotropy values than patients with PD in the lateral geniculate body (\nRegionally, distinctive white matter microstructural values in patients with ET localize to the cerebellar peduncles and thalamo-cortical visual pathways. These findings complement recent functional imaging studies in ET but also extend our understanding of putative physiologic features that account for distinctions between ET and PD.",

    "abstract": "The progressive loss of midbrain (MB) dopaminergic (DA) neurons defines the motor features of Parkinson disease (PD), and modulation of risk by common variants in PD has been well established through genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We acquired open chromatin signatures of purified embryonic mouse MB DA neurons because we anticipated that a fraction of PD-associated genetic variation might mediate the variants' effects within this neuronal population. Correlation with >2,300 putative enhancers assayed in mice revealed enrichment for MB cis-regulatory elements (CREs), and these data were reinforced by transgenic analyses of six additional sequences in zebrafish and mice. One CRE, within intron 4 of the familial PD gene SNCA, directed reporter expression in catecholaminergic neurons from transgenic mice and zebrafish. Sequencing of this CRE in 986 individuals with PD and 992 controls revealed two common variants associated with elevated PD risk. To assess potential mechanisms of action, we screened >16,000 proteins for DNA binding capacity and identified a subset whose binding is impacted by these enhancer variants. Additional genotyping across the SNCA locus identified a single PD-associated haplotype, containing the minor alleles of both of the aforementioned PD-risk variants. Our work posits a model for how common variation at SNCA might modulate PD risk and highlights the value of cell-context-dependent guided searches for functional non-coding variation.",

    "abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopamine neurons provide an opportunity to model Parkinson's disease (PD), but neuronal cultures are confounded by asynchronous and heterogeneous appearance of disease phenotypes in\u00a0vitro. Using high-resolution, single-cell transcriptomic analyses of iPSC-derived dopamine neurons carrying the GBA-N370S PD risk variant, we identified a progressive axis of gene expression variation leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Pseudotime analysis of genes differentially expressed (DE) along this axis identified the transcriptional repressor histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) as an upstream regulator of disease progression. HDAC4 was mislocalized to the nucleus in PD iPSC-derived dopamine neurons and repressed genes early in the disease axis, leading to late deficits in protein homeostasis. Treatment of iPSC-derived dopamine neurons with HDAC4-modulating compounds upregulated genes early in the DE axis and corrected PD-related cellular phenotypes. Our study demonstrates how single-cell transcriptomics can exploit cellular heterogeneity to reveal disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "There is still a substantial unmet need for blood-based biomarkers to make an objective diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the parkinsonism-plus syndromes. This study is aimed to determine whether enumeration of brain-derived exosomes (BDEs) in plasma is informative in the diagnosis of those diseases.\nWe have developed a specific method to enumerate the plasma levels of neuron-derived, astrocyte-derived, and oligodendrocyte-derived exosomes (NDEs, ADEs and ODEs, respectively), and quantified them individually in patients with PD (n\u202f=\u202f15), multiple system atrophy (MSA, n\u202f=\u202f15), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP, n\u202f=\u202f7) and disease controls (n\u202f=\u202f15). Our assays employ specific antibodies against molecules expressed by neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, respectively, combined with an antibody to the exosome common marker CD81.\nThe plasma levels of NDEs showed significant increase in PD compared to control (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and MSA (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (one-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post hoc test). The plasma levels of ODEs and the ratio of ODE/NDE showed a significant correlation with UPDRS part III scores in the patients with MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) (r\nThis is the first paper that enumerated NDE, ADE, and ODE in human plasma and showed the usefulness of those levels as biomarkers for PD.

    "abstract": "The cognitive reserve (CR) theory has been proposed to account for the mismatch between the degree of neuropathological changes and clinical outcome in dementias. Recently, it has also been applied to Parkinson's disease (PD) with promising results, but mostly just focusing on separate proxy measures of CR, such as education, working and leisure time activities, instead of adopting a more comprehensive approach. Using the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq), this study examined the association of CR with motor functions and cognition in patients with medium-low (1-9\u202fyears) and medium-high (>9\u202fyears) PD duration.\nFifty patients with PD underwent a neurological and a neuropsychological assessment, comprised of: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale- section III, Mini-Mental State Examination, Clock-Drawing Test, Rey auditory verbal learning test (immediate and delayed recall trials), Digit Span Forward, Corsi Span Forward, Frontal Assessment Battery, Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices, WAIS similarities subtest, Phonemic Fluency, Semantic Fluency and CRIq.\nPD patients with a higher CRIq score showed a reduced motor impairment and a better global cognitive performance when compared to PD patients with a lower CRIq score, with an advantage especially observed on executive functions and short-term memory. The CR effect was even enhanced in the case of longer disease duration, as observed when considering the overall neuropsychological tests performance and non-verbal abstract reasoning in particular. The results obtained when considering education, as a single proxy measure of CR, provided no additional findings, nor did they reveal all the effects yielded by the adoption of the CRI score.\nOur results support the beneficial role of CR against motor and cognitive dysfunctions in PD and suggest that its protective role may be mostly manifested at the later stages of the disease. A theoretical framework able to explain the different impact of CR on Alzheimer Disease and PD is discussed. Finally, our results stressed the importance of using a comprehensive measure of CR instead of focusing on just one of its proxies.",

    "abstract": "Early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) can be linked to different genetic backgrounds depending on the disease characteristics. In Korean patients with EOPD, however, only 5 PARK genes have been tested. We recruited 70 patients with EOPD from 4 hospitals in Korea, and 12 PARK genes were screened via multigene panel sequencing. Large insertions or deletions were confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. We found 20 rare variants (2 in SNCA, 2 in PRKN, 6 in LRRK2, 3 in PINK1, 1 in DJ1, 4 in FBX07, 1 in HTRA2, and 1 in EIG4G1) in 20 subjects regardless of heterogeneity. Two pathogenic variants (SNCA in 2 subjects and DJ1 in one) were from 3 subjects, and 7 likely pathogenic variants (SNCA, LRRK2, FBXO7, and 2 in PINK1 and PRKN) from 7. Akinetic-rigid subtype and dystonia were more common in patients with EOPD with rare variants than in those without rare variants. Multigene panel tests can be effective at identifying genetic variants in patients with EOPD. In addition, we suggest there are different genetic backgrounds in patients with EOPD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, presenting with midbrain dopaminergic neurons degeneration. A number of studies suggest that microglial activation may have a role in PD. It has emerged that inflammation-derived oxidative stress and cytokine-dependent toxicity may contribute to nigrostriatal pathway degeneration and exacerbate the progression of the disease in patients with idiopathic PD. Cell therapies have long been considered a feasible regenerative approach to compensate for the loss of specific cell populations such as the one that occurs in PD. We recently demonstrated that erythropoietin-releasing neural precursors cells (Er-NPCs) administered to MPTP-intoxicated animals survive after transplantation in the recipient's damaged brain, differentiate, and rescue degenerating striatal dopaminergic neurons. Here, we aimed to investigate the potential anti-inflammatory actions of Er-NPCs infused in an MPTP experimental model of PD.\nThe degeneration of dopaminergic neurons was caused by MPTP administration in C57BL/6 male mice. 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nEr-NPC administration promoted a rapid anti-inflammatory effect that was already evident 24\u2009h after transplant with a decrease of pro-inflammatory and increase of anti-inflammatory cytokines mRNA expression levels. This effect was maintained until the end of the observational period, 2\u2009weeks post-transplant. Here, we show that Er-NPCs transplant reduces macrophage infiltration, directly counteracting the M1-like pro-inflammatory response of murine-activated microglia, which corresponds to the decrease of CD68 and CD86 markers, and induces M2-like pro-regeneration traits, as indicated by the increase of CD206 and IL-10 expression. Moreover, we also show that this activity is mediated by Er-NPCs-derived erythropoietin (EPO) since the co-injection of cells with anti-EPO antibodies neutralizes the anti-inflammatory effect of the Er-NPCs treatment.\nThis study shows the anti-inflammatory actions exerted by Er-NPCs, and we suggest that these cells may represent good candidates for cellular therapy to counteract neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), the ability to perform simultaneous tasks may be impaired. However, there is no consensus as to whether the strategy of use dual task (DT) should be used with PD patients during gait and balance training because DT can increase the risk of falls. Therefore, it is necessary to critically analyze the relevant studies and evaluate the indications for the use of DT and its effects as a therapeutic strategy. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the effects of DT gait and balance training in individuals with PD. A total of 602 studies were found. After applying the eligibility criteria, seven studies were selected (three clinical trials, one uncontrolled clinical trial, and three pilot studies). Despite the poor methodological quality, the studies indicated the use of DT during gait and balance training may be beneficial for people with mild to moderate PD in compare of single-task or no intervention. The use of DT during training presented benefits related to gait (gait speed, step length and cadence) and balance (mediolateral and anteroposterior balance in closed-eyes tests). The current scenario shows that using DT in the training seems not to be harmful and could be part of the rehabilitation of PD patients. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm the findings, and it would be the most importance that these studies stratify individuals with degrees of disease severity to verify the effect of using the DT during training.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effects of an intervention based on a specific set of goals on goal attainment, manual dexterity, hand grip strength and finger prehension force compared to a standardized approach in patients with Parkinson's disease.\nRandomized controlled trial.\nHome-based.\nFifty patients with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease acknowledging impaired manual ability were randomized into two groups.\nPatients in the experimental group ( n\u2009=\u200925) were included in an intervention focused on task components that involved goals proposed by participants. Patients in the control group ( n\u2009=\u200925) received a standard intervention focused on impairments in range of motion, grasp and manipulation. Home condition and duration (four weeks, twice a week) were similar in both groups.\nThe primary outcome measure was goal achievement assessed with the Goal Attainment Scaling. Secondary outcomes were manual dexterity evaluated with the Purdue Pegboard Test and hand grip strength and finger prehension force assessed using a dynamometer.\nAfter four weeks, significant between-group improvement in goal attainment was observed in the experimental group (change 17.36\u2009\u00b1\u20097.48 vs. 4.03\u2009\u00b1\u20096.43, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Compared to the control group, the experimental group also showed a significant improvement ( P\u2009<\u20090.05) in manual dexterity (postintervention values in the most affected arm 10.55\u2009\u00b1\u20091.95 vs. 7.33\u2009\u00b1\u20093.63 pins, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and finger prehension force (postintervention values in the most affected arm 8.03\u2009\u00b1\u20091.93 vs. 6.31\u2009\u00b1\u20091.85\u2009kg, P\u2009=\u20090.010).\nTargeting therapy toward specific goals leads to greater changes in arm function than a standardized approach in people with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of Parkinson's Disease (PD) on the perceptive judgment of stair step height using both exteroceptive visual and exproprioceptive judgments. We invited 14 individuals with PD and 14 neurologically healthy older adults (OA) to perform perceptual judgment tasks for first step stairway heights of 11 and 20\u2009cm. Initially, participants performed first the exteroceptive visual judgment and then the exproprioceptive judgment in five randomized trials for each stair height. An analysis of variance for the exteroceptive visual judgment revealed no main effects or interaction between PD versus OA groups and height. However, the analysis of variance for exproprioceptive judgment revealed a significant interaction between group and height ( F",

Treatment approaches for DDS included: reduction of levodopa, reduction/cessation of dopamine agonist (DA), and initiation of infusion therapies. DDS had completely resolved in just over half the patients. DA peak l-dopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) was higher in patients who failed to achieve remission.\nThis is the first study to provide data on the course of DDS until death. Treatment strategies consisted mainly of reduction of dopaminergic treatment, and, despite the majority of patients showing some improvement, half remained symptomatic.

DDS had completely resolved in just over half the patients. DA peak l-dopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) was higher in patients who failed to achieve remission.",

    "abstract": "We know little about how well the goals and results of clinical trials in Parkinson disease (PD) reflect the priorities of patients and the broader PD community.\nWe conducted a review of registered trials on http://clincialtrials.gov from 2007 to 2016 to explore whether PD trials have moved closer to the therapeutic priority goals articulated by the PD community.\nUsing the search terms: Parkinson, interventional trials, phase \"0-4,\" we categorized therapeutic PD studies from http://clinicaltrials.gov between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2016. Seven hundred and sixty-six trials met the criteria for analysis. We explored temporal trends in the utilization of balance problems and falls; mood symptoms, including stress and anxiety; cognitive dysfunction, including dementia; and dyskinesias as primary outcomes. We analyzed trials where recruitment was listed as \"completed\" (n\u2009=\u2009391) to explore publication rates.\nBalance problems and falls were listed as primary outcome measures in 125 studies (16.3%), cognitive measures in 48 (6.3%), mood features in 37 (4.8%), and dyskinesias in 30 (3.9%). Trials using balance problems and falls as a primary outcome increased in frequency per year between 2007 and 2016 (Z\u2009=\u2009-2.128, \nPD trials focusing on balance problems and falls are becoming more common. About 40% of completed PD trials are unpublished, reflecting suboptimal utilization of participant efforts.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is high in Parkinson's disease (PD). These problems negatively affect quality of life and include both storage and voiding problems. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society established a task force to review clinical rating scales/questionnaires for the assessment of urinary symptoms in PD.\nAccording to prespecified criteria, these scales/questionnaires were classified as \"Recommended\" or \"Recommended with caveats\" when clinimetric properties were satisfactory for Recommended status but had not been assessed specifically in PD, \"Suggested\" or \"Listed.\" These assessments were applied to rate scales as screening tools for the diagnosis of LUTS and for the rating of symptom severity.\nAmong scales that included LUTS but focused on overall autonomic or non-motor symptoms in PD, no scale reached the clinimetric rigor to be designated as Recommended or Recommended with caveats, but some were Suggested for either diagnostic screening tools or severity measures. Among primary urological scales, most are well validated in urological setting, but none was validated specifically in PD. DAN-PSS (Danish PSS), ICIQ (International Consultation for Incontinence Questionnaire)-MLUTS (Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms), OABq, OABq-SF (ICIQ-OABqol), OAB-V8 (as screening tool), and OABSS (OAB Symptom Score) met criteria for Recommended with caveats.\nThe Task Force does not recommend the development of a new scale. However, all above-mentioned questionnaires need to be studied further and specifically validated in PD.",

After 6 months of LCIG infusion, the percentage of REM sleep decreased as well as the number of arousals especially due to reduction of spontaneous arousals and periodic leg movements during REM sleep, but differences were not statistically significant. Also, scores of all study questionnaires showed a tendency to improve.",

    "abstract": "The Washington State Parkinson Disease Registry (WPDR) was created to facilitate recruitment for Parkinson's disease (PD) research studies conducted in the Pacific Northwest. The success of registries that rely on self-report is dependent on the accuracy of the information provided by participants, particularly diagnosis.\nOur goal was to assess diagnostic accuracy within the WPDR cohort. We randomly selected and attempted to contact 168 of the 1,278 actively enrolled WPDR participants. Those who responded were invited to undergo an interview and neurological examination performed by a PD specialist. If an in-person assessment was not possible, we sought information collected during participation in prior research studies or from review of medical records. A diagnosis was considered \"validated\" if the individual met UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank (UKBB) clinical diagnostic criteria for PD.\nData were ascertained for 106 participants; 77 underwent an in-person assessment, 21 had data available from a prior research study, and 8 provided access to medical records. Diagnostic accuracy within the overall sample was 93.4% (95% confidence interval (86.4%, 97.1%)). Seven patients did not fulfill UKBB criteria for the following reasons: early severe autonomic involvement (\nOur results indicate that studies which use the WPDR for recruitment will rarely encounter patients who are misdiagnosed. This further supports the utility of the WPDR as an effective recruitment tool for PD research in the Pacific Northwest.",

    "abstract": "Recently, revised diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease (PD) were introduced (Postuma et al., 2015). Yet, except for well-established dopaminergic imaging, validated imaging biomarkers for PD are still missing, though they could improve diagnostic accuracy. We conducted systematic meta-analyses to identify PD-specific markers in whole-brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies. Overall, 74 studies were identified including 2323 patients and 1767 healthy controls. Studies were first grouped according to imaging modalities (MRI 50; PET 14; DTI 10) and then into subcohorts based on clinical phenotypes. To ensure reliable results, we combined established meta-analytical algorithms - anatomical likelihood estimation and seed-based D mapping - and cross-validated them in a conjunction analysis. Glucose hypometabolism was found using FDG-PET extensively in bilateral inferior parietal cortex and left caudate nucleus with both meta-analytic methods. This hypometabolism pattern was confirmed in subcohort analyses and related to cognitive deficits (inferior parietal cortex) and motor symptoms (caudate nucleus). Structural MRI showed only small focal gray matter atrophy in the middle occipital gyrus that was not confirmed in subcohort analyses. DTI revealed fractional anisotropy reductions in the cingulate bundle near the orbital and anterior cingulate gyri in PD. Our results suggest that FDG-PET reliably identifies consistent functional brain abnormalities in PD, whereas structural MRI and DTI show only focal alterations and rather inconsistent results. In conclusion, FDG-PET hypometabolism outperforms structural MRI in PD, although both imaging methods do not offer disease-specific imaging biomarkers for PD.",

The study was considered technically feasible if participants achieved \u2a7e85% of maximal heart rate during exercise.\nThere were 12 male and 8 female participants; they had a mean age of 68.5\u2009years (standard deviation 6.825). Two participants were of Hoehn and Yahr stage I, 11 stage II and 7 stage III. In all, 17 participants completed the intervention. The median (interquartile range) proportion of repetitions delivered across the intervention which met our high-intensity criterion was 80% (67% to 84%). Mean peak heart rate was 88.8% of maximal. Peak oxygen consumption increased by 2.8\u2009mL\u2009kg\nHigh-intensity interval exercise is feasible in people with Parkinson's disease. Improvements in cardiorespiratory function are promising.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to compare the properties of free-walking at a natural pace between mild Parkinson's disease (PD) patients during the ON-clinical status and two control groups. In-shoe pressure-sensitive insoles were used to quantify the temporal and force characteristics of a 5-min free-walking in 11 PD patients, in 16 young healthy controls, and in 12 age-matched healthy controls. Inferential statistics analyses were performed on the kinematic and kinetic parameters to compare groups' performances, whereas feature selection analyses and automatic classification were used to identify the signature of parkinsonian gait and to assess the performance of group classification, respectively. Compared to healthy subjects, the PD patients' gait pattern presented significant differences in kinematic parameters associated with bilateral coordination but not in kinetics. Specifically, patients showed an increased variability in double support time, greater gait asymmetry and phase deviation, and also poorer phase coordination. Feature selection analyses based on the ReliefF algorithm on the differential parameters in PD patients revealed an effect of the clinical status, especially true in double support time variability and gait asymmetry. Automatic classification of PD patients, young and senior subjects confirmed that kinematic predictors produced a slightly better classification performance than kinetic predictors. Overall, classification accuracy of groups with a linear discriminant model which included the whole set of features (i.e., demographics and parameters extracted from the sensors) was 64.1%.",

Changes in stress-associated factors were measured applying four scales: Kaluza's \"warning signs for stress\" and \"stress-amplifying thoughts\" and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and quality of life (PDQ-8). Short-term outcome (8 weeks) was evaluated in both groups, and long-term outcome (3-6 months) was evaluated only in PD patients.\nAt baseline, PDQ-8 was worse in PD patients compared to controls. PD patients improved significantly regarding short- and long-term outcome scores of \"warning signs for stress,\" \"stress-amplifying thoughts,\" and BDI scores, independently of disease severity or duration. Younger and male PD patients showed the best benefit. Controls improved comparably to PD patients but significantly only with respect to \"stress-amplifying thoughts.\" Retrospectively, 88% (29/33) of PD patients were rated SMT as helpful 12-18 months later.

    "abstract": "The association between circulating magnesium (Mg) and Parkinson's disease (PD) remains ambiguous and controversial. Thus, a meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the circulating Mg levels in PD patients and to clarify whether high circulating Mg levels should be considered as a potential risk factor for PD.\nIn this study, 17 case-control published studies were selected in our meta-analysis by searching the electronic databases of Web of Science, PubMed, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) before June 1, 2018. Overall, 848 PD cases and 784 healthy controls (HC), 1,023 PD cases and 911 HC, and 180 PD cases and 144 HC met the inclusion criteria for this study Mg levels in serum, peripheral blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), respectively. Standardized mean difference (SMD) in random-effects model and 95% CI were used to assess the correlation strength through the comparison of the two groups.\nMeta-analysis showed that the serum Mg levels in PD cases were significantly higher than those in HC individuals (SMD =1.09, 95% CI =0.52, 1.66). Furthermore, this result was further confirmed by the combined analysis of serum and whole blood studies together (SMD =0.64, 95% CI =0.10, 1.19). In addition, the higher CSF Mg levels in patients of PD were observed in comparison with normal range (SMD =0.55, 95% CI =0.21, 0.88). However, this data did not further discuss and analyze because of the smaller sample size of CSF studies.\nOur findings supported the notion that the increase of circulating Mg levels appears in the patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "Hyperphosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites is a characteristic neuropathological feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The catalytic subunit of the specific phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that dephosphorylates \u03b1-synuclein, is hypomethylated in these brains, thereby impeding the assembly of the active trimeric holoenzyme and reducing phosphatase activity. This phosphatase deficiency contributes to the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein, which tends to fibrillize more than unmodified \u03b1-synuclein. Eicosanoyl-5-hydroxytryptamide (EHT), a fatty acid derivative of serotonin found in coffee, inhibits the PP2A methylesterase so as to maintain PP2A in a highly active methylated state and mitigates the phenotype of \u03b1-synuclein transgenic (Syn",

    "abstract": "The discovery of genetic forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) has highlighted the importance of the autophagy/lysosomal and mitochondrial/oxidative stress pathways in disease pathogenesis. However, recently identified PD-linked genes, including DNAJC6 (auxilin), SYNJ1 (synaptojanin 1), and the PD risk gene SH3GL2 (endophilin A1), have also highlighted disruptions in synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE) as a significant contributor to disease pathogenesis. Additionally, the roles of other PD genes such as LRRK2, PRKN, and VPS35 in the regulation of SVE are beginning to emerge. Here we discuss the recent work on the contribution of dysfunctional SVE to midbrain dopaminergic neurons' selective vulnerability and highlight pathways that demonstrate the interplay of synaptic, mitochondrial, and lysosomal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of PD.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is an intracellular degradation process that is involved in \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) homeostasis and Parkinson's disease (PD). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether hydroxysafflor yellow A\u00a0(HSYA) could promote \u03b1-syn clearance via regulating autophagy in PD mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally treated with HSYA. Thirty minutes later, they were intragastrically administered with rotenone at a\u00a0dose of 30 mg/kg. The hanging wire test was performed at 14 and 28 days. Then, autophagosomes and ultrastructural changes were examined by transmission electron microscopy. The expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), \u03b1-syn, JNK1, p-JNK1, Bcl-2, p-Bcl-2, Beclin1, autophagy-related proteins (Atg) 7 and 12-5, and the LC3-II/LC3-I\u00a0ratio were investigated by western blot. The hanging time of HSYA-treated PD mice was significantly increased compared with that of rotenone-induced PD mice (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Compared with rotenone-induced PD mice, treatment with HSYA augmented the formation of autophagosomes. The expression of TH, p-JNK1/JNK1, Beclin1, Atg7, Atg12-5, p-Bcl-2/Bcl-2, and the LC3-II/LC3-I\u00a0ratio were significantly increased, whereas the expression of \u03b1-syn was reduced in the rotenone plus HSYA group. These results indicate that HSYA promoted \u03b1-syn clearance via regulating autophagy in rotenone-induced PD mice.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) patients have turning impairments that may increase fall risk. Clinics lack specialized kinematic equipment used in gait and turn analysis and require a simple method to evaluate fall risk and advise patients in turning strategy selection.\nTo enhance understanding of PD turning strategies and determine if turning can be assessed using a video-recording and categorization method, we compared 180-degree and 90-degree turns as a function of medication status and dual-tasking (DT).\n21 PD participants (H&Y stage 1-3) in PD-ON and PD-OFF medication states and 16 controls completed 180-degree and 90-degree turn-tasks with and without DT. Video-recordings of tasks permitted classification of 180-degree turns into Few-Step turns (FST) vs. Multi-Step turns (MST) and 90-degree turns into Step vs. Spin-turns. FST were further sub-classified into Twisting vs. Sideways turns and MST into Backward, Festination, Forward or Wheeling turns. Percentages of subtypes were analyzed across groups by task.\nIN 180-degree tasks, there was an effect of group: FST vs. MST F(2,55)\u202f=\u202f9.578, p\u202f<\u202f.001. PD participants in the off-medication state (PD-OFF) produced significantly more MST with a larger number of different turning subtypes vs. controls or PD on medication (PD-ON). In 90-degree tasks, controls significantly increased their proportion of Step-turns while DT (p\u202f<\u202f.001), an adaptation not observed in PD-ON or PD-OFF.\nPD turning impairments may stem from an inability to select a unified turning strategy and to adapt to the turning environment, which may be exacerbated in PD-OFF. Video-analysis may prove beneficial in predicting a clinical course for PD patients by revealing features of turning dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily characterized by midbrain dopamine depletion. Dopamine acts through dopamine receptors (D1 to D5) to regulate locomotion, motivation, pleasure, attention, cognitive functions and formation of newborn neurons, all of which are likely to be impaired in PD. Reduced hippocampal neurogenesis associated with dopamine depletion has been demonstrated in patients with PD. However, the precise mechanism to regulate multiple steps of adult hippocampal neurogenesis by dopamine receptor(s) is still unknown. In this study, we tested whether pharmacological agonism and antagonism of dopamine D1 and D2 receptor regulate nonmotor symptoms, neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and fate specification and explored the cellular mechanism(s) underlying dopamine receptor (D1 and D2) mediated adult hippocampal neurogenesis in rat model of PD-like phenotypes. We found that single unilateral intra-medial forebrain bundle administration of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) reduced D1 receptor level in the hippocampus. Pharmacological agonism of D1 receptor exerts anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects as well as enhanced NSC proliferation, long-term survival and neuronal differentiation by positively regulating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in hippocampus in PD rats. shRNA lentivirus mediated knockdown of Axin-2, a negative regulator of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling potentially attenuated D1 receptor antagonist induced anxiety and depression-like phenotypes and impairment in adult hippocampal neurogenesis in PD rats. Our results suggest that improved nonmotor symptoms and hippocampal neurogenesis in PD rats controlled by D1-like receptors that involve the activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the frequency and spectrum of impulsive-compulsive disorders (ICDs) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) without dopaminergic medication and among patients receiving dopaminergic replacement therapy, depending on personality type, genetic factors, and to determine the influence of ICDs on the development of other non-motor manifestations of the disease.\nThree hundred and eighty-six consecutive patients with idiopathic PD, including untreated patients with PD (de novo) and patients receiving dopaminergic replacement therapy during one year, were examined. ICDs were evaluated with QUIP and diagnostic criteria. Personality type and temperament features were assessed by the Eysenck personality inventory. Genotyping for the single nucleotide polymorphism rs141116007 in the DBH gene involved in the pathogenesis of PD and ICDs was performed.\nICDs were identified in 20.2% patients with PD and in 4% patients of the de novo group. The most common (10.36%) behavioral disorder was a binge eating. The frequency of ICDs among patients with PD before the onset of dopamine replacement therapy increased by 1.03 times after one year treatment.

    "abstract": "For patients with highly asymmetrical Parkinson's disease (PD), unilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been suggested as a reasonable treatment. However, the results of a previous 2-year follow-up study involving patients with prominently asymmetrical PD who had unilateral STN DBS suggested that simultaneous bilateral surgery should be performed. In the present study, the authors analyze 7-year follow-up data from the same patient group to examine changes in motor benefit from unilateral STN DBS over time and the interval between initial unilateral surgery and a second (contralateral) STN DBS surgery.\nEight patients with highly asymmetrical parkinsonism who underwent unilateral STN DBS were evaluated. The factors measured were scores on the motor part of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS III), Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stage, and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD). Evaluations occurred at 3, 6, and 12 months after the initial surgery and annually thereafter.\nThe mean follow-up period was 91.5 months (range 36-105 months). Three years after the initial unilateral surgery, motor benefits on the contralateral side continued; however, an aggravation of the ipsilateral parkinsonism attenuated the improvement in total UPDRS III scores, which reverted to baseline. Axial motor score, LEDD, and HY stage did not differ from the baseline. Seven of 8 patients (87.5%) were considered candidates for a second surgery to offer additional motor benefits. Of the 7 candidates, 4 patients (50% of total patients) underwent the second surgery at 58.5 \u00b1 11.6 (mean \u00b1 SD) months after the initial surgery. Three patients were not able to have the second surgery: one patient died of gastric cancer, one patient was severely immobilized by an accident, and one patient could not afford the second surgery. One patient remained content with the initial unilateral surgery throughout the follow-up period.\nSeven of 8 patients with unilateral STN DBS became candidates for second surgery before battery replacement surgery of the first implanted device. Baseline asymmetry alone may not predict appropriate candidates for unilateral STN DBS. This study provides further evidence that, from a long-term perspective, initial simultaneous bilateral STN DBS should be considered for PD patients with prominently asymmetrical motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disease with a high annual incidence. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that microRNAs play important roles in the pathogenesis of multiple neurological disorders, including PD. This study aims to investigate how microRNA-200a (miR-200a) regulates striatal dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) to affect apoptosis of striatum in rats with PD and to explore the associated mechanism.\nAfter successfully establishing a PD model by 6-hydroxydopamine injections, PD rats were mainly treated with miR-200a mimics, inhibitors, Forskolin or a combination of miR-200a inhibitors and Forskolin. High-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD) was employed to detect the levels of dopamine, 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), and chemistry colorimetric methods were applied to detect the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). A TUNEL assay and immunocytochemical staining were performed to observe apoptosis and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells in the striatum. The expression of miR-200a, DRD2, Bad, Bax, Bcl-2, cAMP and PKA was determined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot assays.\nIn the cellular experiments, after transfection with the inhibitor of miR-200a, decreased levels of Bax, GSH-Px, SOD, dopamine, DOPAC and HVA but increased levels of MDA and Bcl-2 were found along with a reduced apoptosis rate and increased TH-positive cell number. In addition, downregulating miR-200a resulted in lower expression of AKT, cAMP and PKA but higher expression of DRD2 and CREB, indicating that the downregulation of miR-200a increases DRD2 expression, which blocks the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.\nThis study provides evidence that the inhibition of miR-200a can repress apoptosis in the striatum via inhibition of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway by upregulating DRD2 expression in PD rats.",

    "abstract": "Patients with idiopathic smell loss constitute an at-risk population for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). The study aimed to follow up a large number of patients with idiopathic smell and/or taste loss to define the incidence of PD in this population and, further, to assess characteristics of both olfactory and gustatory function and their possible association with PD development.\nIn this prospective case-control study, 833 patients diagnosed with an idiopathic smell disorder at our Smell and Taste Center during the last 15\u00a0years were contacted for a telephone interview. In 474 patients, a complete data set containing of demographic data, clinical information, retrospective smell and taste testing results, and telephone assessment was obtained.\nOut of 474 patients with idiopathic smell loss 45 (9.8%) had been diagnosed with PD, since they received the diagnosis of idiopathic smell and/or taste loss (mean 10.9\u00a0years after olfactory loss onset). Thus, with respect to the classification into olfactory/gustatory disorders, 28.6% of the patients with a combined olfactory and gustatory disorder developed PD, whereas in 9.9% of those with a pure olfactory disorder and in 3.8% of those with a pure gustatory disorder, PD was diagnosed. No association emerged between qualitative smell or taste loss and PD development.\nThis large patient cohort study extends the previous literature, indicating that risk stratification might be considerably improved by correct diagnostic allocation and emphasizes the need for an exhaustive olfactory and gustatory assessment in specialized centers.",

    "abstract": "Sleep contributes to the consolidation of our memory and facilitates learning. Short term sleep deprivation temporarily reduces mnestic capacity, whereas long lasting sleep deprivation is associated with structural changes in the hippocampus and cortical areas. However, it is unknown whether early intervention and treatment of sleep disorders could have a neuroprotective effect. In neurodegenerative diseases sleep disorders can occur at preclinical stages and are frequently observed in patients with established Parkinson's disease (PD) and other \u03b1-synucleinopathies. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is recognized as a hallmark for the development of \u03b1-synucleinopathies and may predict early cognitive decline, while excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is present in 12% of patients with PD before treatment initiation and increases continuously over time, causing substantial restrictions for the patients' social life. In more advanced disease, EDS is associated with dementia. Even though well recognized, limited attention has been given to genetics or the treatment of RBD and EDS in early PD. Systematic screening and early intervention can be expected to increase the patients' quality of life, but it remains unclear if this will also impact disease progression. Intervention studies in preclinical and early stages of \u03b1-synucleinopathies are needed to increase our understanding of the underlying pathomechanisms and may also provide important inroads to help clarify whether sleep disturbances are secondary to the neurodegenerative process or also contribute to disease exacerbation.",

    "abstract": "We report a 77-year-old man who suffered from Parkinson's disease for 12 years. Four years after the disease onset, he started to show excessive hobbyism of painting. His painting skills improved along with escalating enthusiasm. He even held a personal exhibition of his paintings. Dopaminergic treatment was increased as he developed wearing-off phenomenon. Six years after the disease onset, he developed dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS). In the same year, he underwent surgery for subthalamic deep brain stimulation. DDS did not improve and he did not lose enthusiasm for painting after surgery. Switching from ropinirole to rotigotine improved the DDS, but did not affect the excessive enthusiasm. At the age of 76, he started to have difficulty in completing the paintings. He had an uncontrollable urge to overlay paint strokes until the colors blurred and the paper was torn. In neuropsychological examinations, Mini-Mental State Examination score was above the cutoff, but Frontal Assessment Battery suggested motor perseveration and disinhibition. In summary, the patient's excessive enthusiasm for painting emerged in association with impulse control disorder (ICD) by dopamine agonist therapy, and subsequent change in his painting style appeared to be related with motor perseveration and/or further escalation of ICD.",

    "abstract": "Gait difficulties are common and frequently devastating to people with Parkinson's disease (PD). These difficulties are often followed by an increased risk of falls, leading to injury, hospitalization and mortality. The dysfunction in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor circuits and reduced activity in the premotor and primary motor cortices has raised interest in transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as an adjunct intervention in PD. tDCS might provide a potentially safe and non-invasive treatment by modulating cortical excitability and behavioural outcomes. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of different monopolar and bipolar montages of tDCS administered to the motor cortex and cerebellum on gait speed in PD.\nThis study will be conducted in a randomized, double-blind cross-over design. Eighteen participants diagnosed with Parkinson's disease will receive anodal and sham tDCS (1\u00a0mA, 20\u00a0min, 10\u2009\u00d7\u20094\u00a0cm\nThis study will investigate the short-term effects of anodal tDCS over the premotor and primary motor cortices on gait abilities using monopolar and bipolar montages in people with PD. The outcomes will inform future studies aimed at inducing longer-lasting changes in neural excitability and performance using multisession tDCS designs in PD.\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), ACTRN12618000063213 .

    "abstract": "There have been a number of reports implicating the association of microRNAs (miRs) and the MAPK signaling pathway with the dopaminergic neuron, which is involved in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study was conducted with aims of exploring the role of miR-96 in the activation of iNOS and apoptosis of dopaminergic neuron through the MAPK signaling pathway in mice with PD.\nThe miR and the differentially expressed gene in PD were screened out and the relationship between them was verified. A mouse model of PD induced by MPTP and was then constructed and treated with miR-96 mimic/inhibitor and CACNG5 overexpression plasmid to extract nigral dopaminergic neuron for the purpose of detecting the effect of miR-96 on PD. The TH and iNOS positive neuronal cells, the apoptotic neuronal cells by TUNEL staining, and expression of miR-96, CACNG5, iNOS, p38MAPK, p-p38MAPK, c-Fos, Bax, and Bcl-2 in substantia nigra dopaminergic neuronal tissues were evaluated.\nThe results obtained from the aforementioned procedure were then verified by cell culture of the SH-SY5Y cells, followed by treatment with miR-96 mimic/inhibitor, CACNG5 overexpression plasmid and the inhibitor of the MAPK signaling pathway. CACNG5 was confirmed as a target gene of miR-96. The inhibition of miR-96 resulted in a substantial increase in nigral cells, TH positive cells and expression of CACNG5 and Bcl-2 in nigral dopaminergic neuronal tissues, and a decrease in iNOS positive cells, apoptotic neuronal cells, and expression of iNOS, p38MAPK, p-p38MAPK, c-Fos, and Bax.\nThe above results implicated that the downregulation of miR-96 inhibits the activation of iNOS and apoptosis of dopaminergic neuron through the blockade of the MAPK signaling pathway by promoting CACNG5 in mice with PD.",

    "abstract": "STN-DBS effectively treats motor symptoms of advanced PD. Nonmotor cognitive symptoms, such as impaired impulse control or decision making, may either improve or worsen with DBS. A potential mediating factor of DBS-induced modulation of cognition is the electrode position within the STN with regard to functional subareas of parallel motor, cognitive, and affective basal ganglia loops. However, to date, the volume of tissue activated and weighted stimulation of STN motor versus nonmotor territories are yet to be linked to differential DBS effects on cognition.\nWe aim to investigate whether STN-DBS influences risk-reward trade-off decisions and analyze its dependency on electrode placement.\nSeventeen PD patients ON and OFF STN-DBS and 17 age-matched healthy controls conducted a sequential decision-making task with escalating risk and reward. We computed the effect of STN-DBS on risk-reward trade-off decisions, localized patients' bilateral electrodes, and analyzed the predictive value of volume of tissue activated in STN motor and nonmotor territories on behavioral change.\nWe found that STN-DBS not only improves PD motor symptoms, but also normalizes overly risk-averse decision behavior in PD. Intersubject variance in electrode location could explain this behavioral change. Specifically, if STN-DBS activated preferentially STN motor territory, patients' risk-reward trade-off decisions more resembled those of healthy controls.\nOur findings support the notion of convergence of different functional circuits within the STN and imply a positive effect of well-placed STN-DBS on nonmotor cognitive functioning in PD. \u00a9 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "A major component of cognitive control is the ability to act flexibly in the environment by either behaving automatically or inhibiting an automatic behaviour. The interleaved pro/anti-saccade task measures cognitive control because the task relies on one's abilities to switch flexibly between pro and anti-saccades, and inhibit automatic saccades during anti-saccade trials. Decline in cognitive control occurs during aging or neurological illnesses such as Parkinson's disease (PD), and indicates decline in other cognitive abilities, such as memory. However, little is known about the relationship between cognitive control and other cognitive processes. Here we investigated whether anti-saccade performance can predict decision-making, visual memory, and pop-out and serial visual search performance. We tested 34 younger adults, 22 older adults, and 20 PD patients on four tasks: an interleaved pro/anti-saccade, a spatial visual memory, a decision-making and two types of visual search (pop-out and serial) tasks. Anti-saccade performance was a good predictor of decision-making and visual memory abilities for both older adults and PD patients, while it predicted visual search performance to a larger extent in PD patients. Our results thus demonstrate the suitability of the interleaved pro/anti-saccade task as a cognitive marker of cognitive control in aging and PD populations.",

    "abstract": "To carry out a cost-utility analysis comparing the cost-effectiveness of levodopa carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) with standard of care (SOC) in patients with advanced Parkinson's Disease (aPD) unsuitable for apomorphine or deep brain stimulation (DBS). LCIG is the only treatment option in this small, but clinically important, population.\nA Markov model with 25 disease states based on disease stage and off-time status plus death. Patients enter the model with aPD spending >50% of their waking day in the off-state. Patients progress through the model in 6-monthly cycles for 20 years to approximate lifetime treatment and capture long-term costs and effects of therapy. Inputs are based on LCIG clinical trials for clinical outcomes and health state utilities, the literature for health state transitions and use UK-based input data wherever possible (drug costs, disease/adverse event management costs, discontinuation rates, mortality rates).\nData collection can be challenging in this small, elderly population with advanced disease, therefore some model inputs were estimated, rather than collected directly. It was assumed that a reduction in off-time was the only benefit after the first year of treatment with LCIG; this is a conservative approach, since there may be additional clinical benefits.\nThere is a considerable incremental gain in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for patients treated with LCIG of 1.26 QALY with an associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u00a352,110. If the impact on caregivers is included, the ICER reduces to \u00a347,266.\nIn cases where there is an orphan population, with no alternative treatment options, HTA assessments have a broader decision-making framework and the ICER is interpreted in this context. In the setting of a very small population, with considerable unmet need, LCIG represents value for money, as reflected by funding approval across the UK.",

    "abstract": "Several meta-analyses including retrospective case-control studies have shown that the risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD) correlates inversely with alcohol consumption and (PD), although the results of prospective longitudinal studies are far from being conclusive. The reasons for this inverse association are not well-known. Because alcohol dehydrogenase is one of the most important alcohol-detoxification enzymes, we tried to replicate a putative association of the risk of developing PD with two missense gene variations affecting the alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) gene (one of them related with aversive effects to alcohol).\nIn a cohort composed of 629 PD patients and 865 age- and gender-matched healthy individuals, we analyzed genotypes and allele frequencies for two common missense ADH1B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely rs1229984 (His48Arg) and rs6413413 (Thr60Ser) using specifically designed TaqMan assays.\nThe frequency of individuals carrying rs1229984T alleles in homozygosity or in heterozygosity was higher in PD than in controls in the whole study cohort (P\u2009<\u20090.001 and P\u2009=\u20090.005, respectively), and in women (P\u2009<\u20090.001 and P\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively). The genotypes for rs6413413 were similar in PD patients and control subjects. Age at onset of PD patients was not statistically related to rs1229984 or rs6413413 genotypes.\nThe missense variant rs1229984T is statistically associated with the risk of developing PD mainly in women, which could explain differences in alcohol consumption in this gender.",

    "abstract": "Whether aging or Parkinson's disease (PD) affects the responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to immunosuppression by bone marrow\u2011derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM\u2011MSCs) and which cytokines are more effective in inducing BM\u2011MSCs to be immunosuppressive remains to be elucidated. PBMCs were isolated from healthy young (age\u00a026\u201135), healthy middle\u2011aged (age\u00a056\u201160) and middle\u2011aged PD\u2011affected individuals. All the recruits were male. The mitogen\u2011stimulated PBMCs and proinflammatory cytokine\u2011pretreated BM\u2011MSCs were co\u2011cultured. The PBMC proliferation was measured using Cell Counting Kit\u20118, while the cytokine secretion was assayed by cytometric bead array technology. The immunosuppressive ability of BM\u2011MSCs was confirmed in young healthy, middle\u2011aged healthy and middle\u2011aged PD\u2011affected individuals. Among the three groups, the PBMC proliferation and cytokine secretion of the young healthy group were suppressed more significantly compared with those of the middle\u2011aged healthy and middle\u2011aged PD\u2011affected group. No significant differences were identified in the PBMC proliferation and cytokine secretion between the patients with PD and the middle\u2011aged healthy subjects. Interferon (IFN)\u2011\u03b3 synergized with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2011\u03b1, interleukin (IL)\u20111\u03b1 or IL\u20111\u03b2 was more effective than either one alone, and the combinations of IFN\u2011\u03b3\u00a0+\u00a0IL\u20111\u03b1 and IFN\u2011\u03b3\u00a0+\u00a0IL\u20111\u03b2 were more effective than IFN\u2011\u03b3\u00a0+\u00a0TNF\u2011\u03b1 in inducing BM\u2011MSCs to inhibit PBMC proliferation. The results of the present study suggested that aging, rather than PD, affects the response of PBMCs toward the suppression of BM\u2011MSC, at least in middle\u2011aged males. Patients with PD aged 56\u201160 remain eligible for anti\u2011inflammatory BM\u2011MSC\u2011based therapy. Treatment of BM\u2011MSCs with IFN\u2011\u03b3\u00a0+\u00a0IL\u20111\u03b1 or IFN\u2011\u03b3\u00a0+\u00a0IL\u20111\u03b2 prior to transplantation may result in improved immunosuppressive effects.",

    "abstract": "Substantia nigra (SN) hyper-echogenicity (SN+) describes an enlargement (>90th percentile) of the area of echogenicity at the anatomic site of the SN in the midbrain detected by transcranial sonography. This ultrasound sign has proven to be a valuable marker supporting the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although there is considerable variation in the extent of echogenic signals at the anatomic site of the SN among PD patients, previous work suggests that SN+ is a stable marker throughout the course of the disease. The present study focused on two aspects: (i) determining whether SN+ values differ between the sides, mirroring the asymmetric character of the disease; and (ii) determining whether age has an influence on SN echogenicity. This cross-sectional study included 300 PD patients and 200 healthy controls. SN+ was measured planimetrically by transcranial sonography. Echogenicity was analyzed separately for onset and non-onset sides, with onset side defined as the SN contralateral to the side of the body that first manifested PD-related motor impairment. Age of the patients and healthy controls at study time was used for correlation. We found that the onset SN+ contralateral to the side of initial motor symptoms was on average 17.6% larger than its counterpart. However, we also found that contrary to the control group, where an increase in age was associated with an increase in size of SN+, age of PD patients was associated with a decline in size of the onset SN+. Furthermore, SN measured at the onset side of PD patients correlated significantly with patient age and Hoehn and Yahr stage, a scale that grades PD severity, although this was not the case for the non-onset side. The present study indicates that changes in SN echogenicity have a different dynamic depending on the onset side of the disease. The age at study time had a significantly negative effect on the size of onset SN+, the effect on the non-onset side was non-significant. We conclude that for appropriate PD analysis, onset SN+ is a more important marker than the average of both sides of SN. Furthermore, we found that among healthy controls, the size of SN+ increases with age.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a complex, multisystem disorder with both neurologic and systemic nonmotor manifestations. It is neurodegenerative in nature in which disordered balance, gait, and falls are universal problems that can be present at initial diagnosis, and which progress over time. Freezing of gait is a particularly debilitating feature of PD that becomes more prevalent over time with disease progression, being present in approximately 7% after 2 years of disease and 28% after 5 years. Approximately 60% of people with PD fall each year, with around 70% of fallers falling recurrently, and some recurrent fallers falling multiple times per week. Many risk factors for falls in people with PD have been identified; these include a history of falls, freezing of gait, and abnormalities in measures of balance, leg muscle strength, mobility, cognition, and fear of falling. Therapies for improving physical function and mobility include levodopa, cholinesterase inhibitors, methylphenidate, deep-brain stimulation, cuing for freezing of gait, and exercise. This chapter reviews the clinical, pathologic, and physiologic correlates of gait disturbance and falls in PD, as well as the evidence for medical and nonmedical interventions.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation and accumulation are common pathological hallmarks in neurodegenerative diseases. To efficiently clear and eliminate such aggregation becomes an important cellular strategy for cell survival. Lewy bodies inclusion and aggregation of \u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) during the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) serve as a good example and are potentially linked to other pathological PD features such as progressive dopaminergic neuron cell death, behavioral defects, and nonmotor symptoms like anosmia, cognitive impairment, and depression. Years of research have revealed a variety of mechanisms underlying \u03b1-Syn aggregation, clearance, and spread. Particularly, vesicular routes associated with the trafficking of \u03b1-Syn, leading to its aggregation and accumulation, have been shown to play vital roles in PD pathogenesis. How \u03b1-Syn proteins propagate among cells in a prion-like manner, either from or to neurons and glia, via means of uptake or secretion, are questions under active investigation and have been of central interest in the field of PD study. This review covers components and pathways of possible vesicular routes involved in \u03b1-Syn trafficking. Events including but not limited to exocytosis and endocytosis will be discussed within the context of an overall cellular trafficking theme. Recent advances on \u03b1-Syn trafficking mechanisms and their significance in mediating PD pathogenesis will be thoroughly reviewed, ending with a discussion on the advantages and limitations of different animal PD models.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the most prevalent movement disorder. PD is characterized by dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra, but its etiology has yet to be established. Among several genetic variants contributing to PD pathogenesis, \u03b1-synuclein and leucine-rich repeat kinase (LRRK2) are widely associated with neuropathological phenotypes in familial and sporadic PD. \u03b1-Synuclein and LRRK2 found in Lewy bodies, a pathogenic hallmark of PD, are often posttranslationally modified. As posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are key processes in regulating the stability, localization, and function of proteins, PTMs have emerged as important modulators of \u03b1-synuclein and LRRK2 pathology. Aberrant PTMs altering phosphorylation, ubiquitination, nitration and truncation of these proteins promote PD pathogenesis, while other PTMs such as sumoylation may be protective. Although the causes of many aberrant PTMs are unknown, environmental risk factors may contribute to their aberrancy. Environmental toxicants such as rotenone and paraquat have been shown to interact with these proteins and promote their abnormal PTMs. Notably, manganese (Mn) exposure leads to a PD-like neurological disorder referred to as manganism-and induces pathogenic PTMs of \u03b1-synuclein and LRRK2. In this review, we highlight the role of PTMs of \u03b1-synuclein and LRRK2 in PD pathogenesis and discuss the impact of environmental risk factors on their aberrancy.",

    "abstract": "Evidence indicates that oxidative stress has an important role in the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Antioxidant agents from natural products have shown neuroprotective effects in animal models of PD. Eplingiella fruticosa is an aromatic and medicinal plant of the Lamiaceae family that include culinary herbs. The essential oil (EPL) has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Cyclodextrins are used to enhances pharmacological profile of essential oil. We obtained the EPL from leaves and complexed with \u03b2-cyclodextrin (EPL-\u03b2CD). Phytochemical analysis showed as main constituents: \u03b2-caryophyllene, bicyclogermacrene and 1,8-cineole. We evaluated the effects of EPL and EPL-\u03b2CD (5\u202fmg/kg, p.o. for 40 days) on male mice submitted to the progressive reserpine PD model. Behavioral evaluations, lipid peroxidation quantification and immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase were conducted. EPL delayed the onset of catalepsy and decreased membrane lipid peroxides levels in the striatum. EPL-\u03b2CD also delayed the onset of catalepsy, reduced the frequency of oral diskynesia, restored memory deficit, produced anxiolytic activity and protected against dopaminergic depletion in the striatum and SNpc. These findings showed that EPL has a potential neuroprotective effect in a progressive PD animal model. Further, EPL-\u03b2CD enhanced this protective effects, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach to ameliorate the symptoms of PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway, which leads to the cardinal motor symptoms of the disease - tremor, rigidity and postural instability. A number of non-motor symptoms are also associated with PD, including cognitive impairment, mood disturbances and dysfunction of gastrointestinal and autonomic systems. Current therapies provide symptomatic relief but do not halt the disease process, so there is an urgent need for preventative strategies. Lifestyle interventions such as aerobic exercise have shown potential to lower the risk of developing PD and to alleviate both motor and non-motor symptoms. However, there is a lack of large-scale randomised clinical trials that have employed exercise in PD patients. This review will focus on the evidence from studies on rodent models of PD, for employing exercise as an intervention for both motor and non-motor symptoms.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) into oligomers leads to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD), but intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) which contains antibodies against \u03b1-syn monomers and oligomers fails to treat PD mouse model. The reason may be because IVIG contains much low level of antibodies against \u03b1-syn, and of which only a small part can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, resulting in an extremely low level of effective antibodies in the brain, and limiting the beneficial effect of IVIG on PD mice. Here, we first isolated naturally occurring autoantibodies against \u03b1-syn (NAbs-\u03b1-syn) from IVIG. Our further investigation results showed that NAbs-\u03b1-syn inhibited \u03b1-syn aggregation and attenuated \u03b1-syn-induced cytotoxicity in vitro. Compared with vehicles, NAbs-\u03b1-syn significantly attenuated the memory and motor deficits by reducing the levels of soluble \u03b1-syn, total human \u03b1-syn and \u03b1-syn oligomers, decreasing the intracellular p-\u03b1-syn",

    "abstract": "It is widely accepted that amyloid oligomers are the most toxic species to initiate the pathologic processes of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntingdon's disease (HD). But there is no definitive diagnosis for PD and HD at their early stages. Here, we conjugated an amyloid oligomer-specific scFv antibody (W20) to PEGylated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and detected the properties of the SPIONs conjugated with W20. The results showed that W20-SPIONs, with the size of around 11.8\u202fnm in diameter, were stable and nontoxic, and had enough relaxation capacity to be used as an MRI contrast agent. When applied to the transgenic mouse models of PD and HD, W20-SPIONs crossed the blood-brain barrier and specifically bound to the oligomer area to give MRI signal, distinguishing PD and HD from healthy controls. These results indicated that W20-SPIONs had potential in early-stage diagnosis for PD and HD and also opened up a new strategy for evaluating the efficacy of new drugs.",

    "abstract": "Neuropathological changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) can coexist in the same sample, suggesting possible common degenerative mechanisms.\nThe objective of this study was to use RNA-sequencing to compare gene expression in AD and PD vulnerable brain regions and search for co-expressed genes.\nTotal RNA was isolated from AD/CTL frontal cortex and PD/CTL ventral midbrain. Sequencing libraries were prepared, multiplex paired-end RNA sequencing was carried out, and bioinformatics analyses of gene expression used both publicly available (tophat2/bowtie2/Cufflinks) and commercial (Qlucore Omics Explorer) algorithms.\nBoth AD (frontal cortex, \nAD and PD in vulnerable brain regions appear to arise from and result in independent molecular genetic abnormalities, but we identified several under-expressed genes with potential to treat both diseases.

    "abstract": "Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is effective for the control of motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study is to report the reduction of dyskinesias after transitioning from 16 to 24-h/day LCIG infusion. From a cohort of 74 PD patients treated with LCIG for motor fluctuations, we identified 12 patients that were treated with 24-h per day infusion with the aim to control troublesome daytime dyskinesia. Clinical, demographic, dyskinesia rating scales were evaluated. Daytime dyskinesia was reduced in 75% (9/12) patients following treatment with 24-h therapy, including 7 who were compared with 16-h therapy and 2 that were transitioned from oral dopaminergic therapy to 24-h LCIG. Combining the data from all 12 subjects, troublesome dyskinesias were reduced during 24-h LCIG; UPDRS 4.1 (time spent with dyskinesias) mean change was -1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75, ",

    "abstract": "Levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) negatively impact on the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We assessed the risk factors for LID in a cohort of de-novo PD patients enrolled in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). This retrospective cohort study included all PD patients enrolled in the PPMI cohort. Main outcome was the incidence rate of dyskinesia, defined as the first time the patient reported a non-zero score in the item \"Time spent with dyskinesia\" of the MDS-UPDRS part IV. Predictive value for LID development was assessed for clinical and demographical features, dopamine transporter imaging (DaTscan) pattern, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (A\u03b242, total tau, phosphorylated tau, total \u03b1 synuclein) and genetic risk score for PD. Overall, data from 423 PD patients were analyzed. The cumulative incidence rate of LID was 27.4% (95% CI\u2009=\u200923.2-32.0%), with a mean onset time of 5.81 years from PD diagnosis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed several factors predicting LID development, including female gender (HR\u2009=\u20091.61, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.05-2.47), being not completely functional independent as measured by the modified Schwab & England ADL scale (HR\u2009=\u20091.81, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.98-3.38), higher MDS-UPDRS part III score (HR\u2009=\u20091.03, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.00-1.05), postural instability gait disturbances or intermediate phenotypes (HR\u2009=\u20091.95, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.28-2.96), higher DaTscan caudate asymmetry index (HR\u2009=\u20091.02, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.00-1.03), higher polygenic genetic risk score (HR\u2009=\u20091.39, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.08-1.78), and an anxiety trait (HR\u2009=\u20091.02, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.00-1.04). In PD patients, cumulative levodopa exposure, female gender, severity of motor and functional impairment, non-tremor dominant clinical phenotype, genetic risk score, anxiety, and marked caudate asymmetric pattern at DaTscan at baseline represent independent risk factors for developing LID.",

    "abstract": "Levodopa (LD), in combination with a decarboxylase inhibitor, is a mainstay and the most effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Unfortunately, during chronic treatment with this agent, ON-OFF phenomena and dyskinesia appear. Despite the many medical treatment options available, unpredictable OFF episodes can still occur and be severe and disabling. A rescue therapy that provides a rapid and predictable ON response for patients with OFF periods would be of great value for such patients. Areas covered: CVT-301 is a self-administered dry powder aerosol inhaled formulation of LD that is being developed as a self-administered treatment for OFF periods. The PK profile of CVT-301, the efficacy, and the safety highlighted in randomized clinical trials will be reviewed. Expert opinion: CVT-301 may offer several potential advantages including increased systemic bioavailability through pulmonary absorption, rapid onset of action, avoidance of first-pass drug metabolism and less plasma-level variability.

    "abstract": "Plasma neurofilament light (NFL) has been proposed as a blood-based biomarker for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and parkinsonian disorders. However, the relationship between plasma NFL and cognitive decline in dementia due to Parkinson's disease (PD) remains to be elucidated. In this research, 119 AD, 56 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 26 non-demented PD (PDND), and 23 Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) patients, as well as 59 cognitively healthy controls (HC) were recruited. Each subject underwent a battery of neuropsychological testing. Plasma NFL levels were measured in duplicate using an NF-Light assay and transferred onto the Simoa platform with a home-brew kit. Plasma NFL was significantly increased in the AD group, compared with the control, MCI, PDND, and PDD groups. Plasma NFL was significantly higher in the PDD group, compared with the PDND group. High plasma NFL correlated with poor cognition in AD and PD, but not with motor symptoms in PD. Plasma NFL may represent a biomarker of cognitive decline in AD and PD, with more specificity for AD.",

    "abstract": "Identify key features of an enduring group exercise program for people with Parkinson's disease (PD) by exploring experiences of participants, student assistants and the exercise instructor through a convergent mixed methods design.\nFourteen people with PD (modified Hoehn & Yahr: 1-3.5) who regularly participated in a group exercise program (\u2265 50% of classes for \u2265 1\u2009year) were interviewed to explore their perceptions of the program. The exercise instructor was also interviewed and weekly written reflections were collected from 18 undergraduate student assistants. Using a grounded theory approach, interviews and written reflections were thematically analyzed via qualitative content analysis. Quantitative data from the Physical Fitness and Exercise Activity Levels of Older Adults Scale were used as part of a convergent mixed-methods design to move towards theory formation.\nThematic analysis of the PD participant interviews revealed 4 themes: 1) Quality of the program, 2) Social interactions, 3) Facilitators to exercise, 4) Barriers to exercise. The exercise instructor interview revealed 2 themes: individualization and functionality of exercises, and creating a nurturing atmosphere. Themes from students' data included student learning, and positive in-class experiences. Means (sd) were 1.6 (0.5) for facilitators and 3.0 (0.5) for barriers subscales (1=strongly agree to 4=strongly disagree).\nThese varied sources of data converge to identify and characterize key features of an enduring group exercise program for people with PD: a positive and nurturing environment, varied and individually tailored exercise content, and the importance of social cohesion. These findings also highlight the critical role of multiple stakeholders in fostering an environment that facilitates long-term adherence to group exercise.",

    "abstract": "Wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) integration site (Wnt) signaling is one of the most critical pathways in developing and adult tissues. In the brain, Wnt signaling contributes to different neurodevelopmental aspects ranging from differentiation to axonal extension, synapse formation, neurogenesis, and neuroprotection. Canonical Wnt signaling is mediated mainly by the multifunctional \u03b2-catenin protein which is a potent co-activator of transcription factors such as lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) and T-cell factor (TCF). Accumulating evidence points to dysregulation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in major neurodegenerative disorders. This review highlights a Wnt/\u03b2-catenin/glial connection in Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common movement disorder characterized by the selective death of midbrain dopaminergic (mDAergic) neuronal cell bodies in the subtantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and gliosis. Major findings of the last decade document that Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in partnership with glial cells is critically involved in each step and at every level in the regulation of nigrostriatal DAergic neuronal health, protection, and regeneration in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD, focusing on Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling to boost a full neurorestorative program in PD.",

    "abstract": "The gait pattern in Parkinson\u00b4s disease (PD) is characterized by a deficit in the internal regulation of stride length (SL), while the control of cadence (Cad) remains intact. The use of the treadmill as a gait rehabilitation tool has provided novel options for treatment of gait impairments in PD. However, it remains unclear whether walking on the treadmill changes the stride length-cadence relationship (SLCrel) in PD. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the SLCrel in PD subjects walking on a treadmill vs. overground, and to further compare the SLCrel to that of age-matched healthy subjects.\nFifteen PD subjects and fifteen age-matched controls walked overground and on a treadmill at five different self-selected speeds. Gait speed, SL and Cad were recorded at each self-selected speed. A linear regression analysis was conducted to explore the SLCrel and to determine the slope and intercept for each participant.\nPD subjects showed a lower intercept than control subjects when walking both overground and on a treadmill (F\u2009=\u20098.51, p\u2009=\u20090.007). In comparison with walking overground, walking on a treadmill resulted in a significant increase in the intercept in both PD and control groups (F\u2009=\u200912.17, p\u2009=\u20090.002). There were no significant differences in the slope of the SLCrel.\nPD subjects are able to improve the internal regulation of SL when walking on a treadmill. Our results confirm the potential therapeutic effects of treadmill training for gait rehabilitation in PD and suggest that the mechanisms underlying the positive effects of treadmill training on PD subjects are sustained.",

    "abstract": "Freezing, an episodic movement breakdown that goes from disrupted gait patterns to complete arrest, is a disabling symptom in Parkinson's disease. Several efforts have been made to objectively identify freezing episodes (FEs), although a standardized methodology to discriminate freezing from normal movement is lacking. Novel mathematical approaches that provide information in the temporal and frequency domains, such as the continuous wavelet transform, have demonstrated promising results detecting freezing, although still with limited effectiveness. We aimed to determine whether a computerized algorithm using the continuous wavelet transform based on baseline (i.e. no movement) rather than on amplitude decrease is more effective detecting freezing. Twenty-six individuals with Parkinson's disease performed two trials of a repetitive stepping-in-place task while they were filmed by a video camera and tracked by a motion capture system. The number of FEs and their total duration were determined from a visual inspection of the videos and from three different computed algorithms. Differences in the number and total duration of the FEs between the video inspection and each of the three methods were obtained. The accuracy to identify the time of occurrence of a FE by each method was also calculated. A significant effect of Method was found for the number (p = 0.016) and total duration (p = 0.013) of the FEs, with the method based on baseline being the closest one to the values reported from the videos. Moreover, the same method was the most accurate in detecting the time of occurrence, and the one reaching the highest sensitivity (88.2%). Findings suggest that threshold detection methods based on baseline and movement amplitude decreases capture different characteristics of Parkinsonian gait, with the first one being more effective at detecting FEs. Moreover, robust approaches that consider both time and frequency characteristics are more sensitive in identifying freezing.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with HIV treated with antiretroviral therapy can expect to reach average life span, making them susceptible to combined disease and aging effects on cognitive and motor functions. Slowed processing speed in HIV is a concern for cognitive and everyday functioning and is sensitive to declines in aging. We hypothesized that information processing (IP) deficits, over and above that expected with normal aging, would occur in older HIV patients similar to those observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, with both conditions affecting frontostriatal pathways.\nGroups comprised 26 individuals with HIV infection, 29 with mild-to-moderate PD, and 21 healthy controls (C). Speed of IP was assessed with the oral version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test and the color naming condition of the Golden Stroop Task.\nThe HIV group was impaired on speed of IP tasks compared with both the C and PD groups. Even after controlling for normal aging effects, older age in the HIV group correlated with IP slowing. Slower IP speed was associated with poorer general cognitive ability and more extrapyramidal motor signs in older HIV-infected individuals.\nThe notable effects of impaired IP speed, over and above neurotypical age-related declines, indicate that older HIV-infected individuals may have an enhanced vulnerability for developing nonmotor and motor symptoms despite antiretroviral therapy. Assessing for oral IP speed may provide the unique opportunity to identify early signs of progressive clinical declines in HIV. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and lacks effective treatment to improve the prognosis for patients. Symptomatic treatment for AD mainly includes two categories: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (memantine). They cannot significantly improve the quality of life and extend survival time for AD patients. Worse, almost all clinical trials for disease-modifying drugs have failed, and the reduction of brain \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition by multiple approaches, including inhibitors of \u03b2- or \u03b3-secretase, vaccines, and antibodies against A\u03b2 deposition, was found to have little effect on AD progression. A new therapeutic strategy for AD is urgently needed. Parkinson's disease also is a neurodegenerative disease having no effective treatment for modifying the disease. Nevertheless, successful symptomatic treatment using the combined therapies of l-DOPA supplement and modulators of l-DOPA metabolism greatly improves the prognosis for PD patients; the average survival time of the patient has been extended from 3-4 years to 10-15 years although dopaminergic neurons are still progressively decreasing. This provides useful implications for AD therapeutic strategies. AD patients manifest global cognitive decline, prominently represented by memory deficit, especially in the early stages of the disease. Further, the degree of decreased cognitive abilities correlates with cholinergic dysfunction and the hypometabolism of glucose, the dominant energy fuel for brain. Thus, the amelioration of brain cholinergic function and brain energy metabolism may be effective treatment to improve cognitive abilities of AD patients. Here, we highlighted the explorations of symptomatic therapeutics through modulating brain cholinergic function and energy metabolism in AD.",

Prevalence of visual hallucinations (VH) in identified studies meeting eligibility criteria were included in meta-analyses, facilitating comparison with AH. Synthesis of qualitative descriptions of AH was performed. PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases were searched for primary journal articles, written in English, published from 1970 to 2017. Studies reporting AH prevalence in PD or DLB were screened using PRISMA methods.\nSearches identified 4542 unique studies for consideration, of which, 26 met inclusion criteria. AH pooled prevalence in PD was estimated to be 8.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.3-14.5], while in DLB was estimated to be 30.8% (\u00b123.4 to 39.3). Verbal hallucinations, perceived as originating outside the head, were the most common form of AH. Non-verbal AH were also common while musical AH were rare. VH were more prevalent, with an estimated pooled prevalence in PD of 28.2% (\u00b119.1 to 39.5), while in DLB they were estimated to be 61.8% (\u00b149.1 to 73.0).

    "abstract": "The neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD) are the degeneration and death of dopamine-producing neurons in the ventral midbrain, the widespread intraneuronal aggregation of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1) in Lewy bodies and neurites, neuroinflammation, and gliosis. Signs of microglia activation in the PD brain postmortem as well as during disease development revealed by neuroimaging, implicate immune responses in the pathophysiology of the disease. Intensive research during the last two decades has advanced our understanding of the role of these responses in the disease process, yet many questions remain unanswered. A transformative finding in the field has been the confirmation that in vivo microglia are able to respond directly to pathological a-syn aggregates but also to neuronal dysfunction due to intraneuronal a-syn toxicity well in advance of neuronal death. In addition, clinical research and disease models have revealed the involvement of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Indeed, the data suggest that PD leads not only to a microglia response, but also to a cellular and humoral peripheral immune response. Together, these findings compel us to consider a more holistic view of the immunological processes associated with the disease. Central and peripheral immune responses aimed at maintaining neuronal health will ultimately have consequences on neuronal survival. We will review here the most significant findings that have contributed to the current understanding of the immune response in PD, which is proposed to occur early, involve peripheral and brain immune cells, evolve as neuronal dysfunction progresses, and is likely to influence disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disorders constitute a major aspect of the non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Rapid eye movement\u00a0(REM) behavior disorders are the most frequently experienced parasomnias in patients with PD. Non-REM sleep disorders like confusional arousals, sleep terrors, sleepwalking, and sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) are also associated with PD. Parasomnias can affect the quality of life of the patients as well as the night time sleep of their bed partners. Hence, it is important for physicians to recognize the occurrence of parasomnias in PD. We report an unusual case of PD with SRED along with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and REM behavior disorder. To our knowledge, only two cases have been reported in the literature highlighting the association of SRED with PD. We also explain the different night-time eating disorders like nocturnal eating syndrome and binge eating syndrome, which can be seen in PD, and differentiate them from SRED.",

Although the mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease are not fully understood, considerable evidence suggests that neuro-inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis are involved in the disease. p38MAPK, an important member of the mitogen-activated protein family, controls several important functions in the cell, suggesting a potential pathogenic role in PD. This review provides a brief description of the role and mechanism of p38MAPK in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Studying pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), requires adequate disease models. The available patient's material is limited to biological fluids and post mortem brain samples. Disease modeling and drug screening can be done in animal models, although this approach has its own limitations, since laboratory animals do not suffer from many neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. The use of neurons obtained by targeted differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with known genetic mutations, as well as from carriers of sporadic forms of the disease, will allow to elucidate new components of the molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Such neuronal cultures can also serve as unique models for testing neuroprotective compounds and monitoring neurodegenerative changes against a background of various therapeutic interventions. In the future, dopaminergic neurons differentiated from iPSCs can be used for cell therapy of PD.",

    "abstract": "Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), metabolites of arachidonic acid, play a crucial role in cytoprotection by attenuating oxidative stress, in\ufb02ammation and apoptosis. EETs are rapidly metabolised in vivo by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Increasing the half life of EETs by inhibiting the sEH enzyme is a novel strategy for neuroprotection. In the present study, sEH inhibitors APAU was screened in silico and further evaluated for their antiparkinson activity against rotenone (ROT) induced neurodegeneration in N27 dopaminergic cell line and Drosophila melanogaster model of Parkinson disease (PD). In the in vitro study cell viability (MTT and LDH release assay), oxidative stress parameters (total intracellular ROS, hydroperoxides, protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidise, glutathione reductase, glutathione, total antioxidant status, mitochondrial complex-1activity and mitochondrial membrane potential), inflammatory markers (IL-6, COX-1 and COX-2), and apoptotic markers (JNK, phospho-JNK, c-jun, phospho-c-jun, pro and active caspase-3) were assessed to study the neuroprotective effects. In vivo activity of APAU was assessed in Drosophila melanogaster by measuring survival rate, negative geotaxis, oxidative stress parameters (total intracellular ROS, hydroperoxides, glutathione levels) were measured. Dopamine and its metabolites were estimated by LC-MS/MS analysis. In the in silico study the molecule, APAU showed good binding interaction at the active site of sEH (PDB: 1VJ5). In the in vitro study, APAU significantly attenuated ROT induced changes in oxidative, pro-inflammatory and apoptotic parameters. In the in vivo study, APAU significantly attenuates ROT induced changes in survival rate, negative geotaxis, oxidative stress, dopamine and its metabolites levels (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Our study, therefore, concludes that the molecule APAU, has significant neuroprotection benefits against rotenone induced Parkinsonism.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that has no reliable biomarkers. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of semi-automated sub-regional analysis of the striatum with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to distinguish PD patients from controls (i.e., as a diagnostic biomarker) and to compare PD patients at different stages of disease. With 3 Tesla MRI, diffusion- and T1-weighted scans were obtained on two occasions in 24 PD patients and 18 age-matched, healthy controls. PD patients completed one session on and the other session off dopaminergic medication. The striatum was parcellated into seven functionally disparate sub-regions. The segmentation was guided by reciprocal connections to distinct cortical regions. Volume, surface-based morphometry, and integrity of white matter connections were calculated for each striatal sub-region. Test-retest reliability of our volume, morphometry, and white matter integrity measures across scans was high, with correlations ranging from r\u202f=\u202f0.452, p\u202f<\u202f0.05 and r\u202f=\u202f0.985, p\u202f<\u202f0.001. Global measures of striatum such as total striatum, nucleus accumbens, caudate nuclei, and putamen were not significantly different between PD patients and controls, indicating poor sensitivity of these measures, which average across sub-regions that are functionally heterogeneous and differentially affected by PD, to act as diagnostic biomarkers. Further, these measures did not correlate significantly with disease severity, challenging their potential to serve as progression biomarkers. In contrast, a) decreased volume and b) inward surface displacement of caudal-motor striatumthe region first and most dopamine depleted in PDdistinguished PD patients from controls. Integrity of white matter cortico-striatal connections in caudal-motor and adjacent striatal sub-regions (i.e., executive and temporal striatum) was reduced for PD patients relative to controls. Finally, volume of limbic striatum, the only striatal sub-region innervated by the later-degenerating ventral tegmental area in PD, was reduced in later-stage compared to early stage PD patients a potential progression biomarker. Segmenting striatum based on distinct cortical connectivity provided highly sensitive MRI measures for diagnosing and staging PD.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurologic disorder involving degeneration of the dopaminergic system. Its clinical manifestations include motor and nonmotor symptoms. Several nonpharmacologic therapies, such as music therapy (MT), have recently been developed in order to improve the clinical manifestations of this disease. The aim of this narrative literature review is to analyze the scientific evidence for the therapeutic effects of music in PD.\nWe undertook a search in the databases of PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, MEDLINE, and Science Direct.\nInclusion criteria were articles including persons with PD rehabilitated with an MT intervention.\nKeywords used were music therapy, Parkinson's disease, auditory cueing, non-motor symptoms, motor symptoms, and quality of life.\nWe detected a total of 27 articles, all of which analyzed the therapeutic effects of MT in PD. Of these, 20 studies analyzed the effects in motor symptoms (16 showed beneficial effects and 4, nonbeneficial effects); 9 studies analyzed the effects in nonmotor symptoms, 7 of which demonstrated beneficial effects; and 8 studies analyzed the effects on quality of life, with 6 reporting benefits. None of the articles analyzing nonmotor symptoms and quality of life showed negative effects.\nMost of the studies analyzed demonstrated that MT has beneficial effects for the nonpharmacologic treatment of motor and nonmotor symptoms and quality of life of persons with PD. The use of music as a therapeutic tool combined with conventional therapies should be taken into account.",

    "abstract": "Gait is impaired in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the effect of habitual footwear on gait spatiotemporal parameters has already been established in neurologically healthy individuals, its effects on people with PD is unknown.\nThis study aimed to investigate the impact of habitual footwear on the step spatiotemporal parameters in people with PD.\nSixteen individuals with PD (G-PD) and 15 neurologically healthy individuals (G-HC) were assessed. Participants walked on an 8\u2009m long pressure sensitive walkway at their preferred speed with and without their habitual footwear (3 trials per condition). Footwear included flip-flops, shoes, sneakers and sandals. The average, variability and asymmetry for step length, width, duration, and velocity and the percentage time in the swing and stance phases were calculated.\nThe results showed in both groups a reduced percentage time in the swing phase and an increased step width, duration and length with footwear (F(1,29)>5.64; p<0.02). Additionally, habitual footwear increased step width variability in G-PD and G-HC (F(1,29)=3.97; p=0.06). Interestingly, only G-HC showed a higher step length asymmetry in the footwear condition than in the barefoot condition (p=0.02). Finally, only when habitual footwear was used, G-HC showed a higher step velocity asymmetry than G-PD (p=0.04).\nThese results indicate a negative influence of footwear on gait spatiotemporal parameters in both groups. Furthermore, footwear induced differences between groups. These findings indicate that footwear use is an influencing factor in studies comparing people with PD and healthy elderly. Further data are needed before definitive recommendations are made.",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait is an episodic inability to move the feet forward despite the intention to walk. It is a common cause of falls and subsequent morbidity and mortality in Parkinson's disease. Virtual reality paradigms provide an opportunity to safely evaluate freezing of gait, in order to better understand the underlying pathophysiology. This article focuses on the methodology, threshold used to define freezing of gait, results, limitations of studies using virtual reality paradigms, and proposes future directions of research. Summarizing these articles improves our understanding of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease, and critical evaluation provides an opportunity for future studies to improve upon these efforts.\nWe performed a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines, of studies using VR paradigms to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of PD-FOG.\nThis review initially identified 57 articles, but after exclusion of duplicates, abstracts, and studies not focused on the underlying pathophysiology of this disorder, 12 peer-reviewed articles using virtual reality paradigms to evaluate freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease were found.\nVirtual reality paradigms are able to reproduce freezing of gait. Studies using MRI compatible virtual reality to evaluate freezing of gait found dysfunctional connectivity between cortical and subcortical structures during episodes. However, several important limitations of these studies should caution our interpretation of these results. Future studies which improve the design and methodology are needed to ultimately identify the cause and subsequent treatments for freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to investigate (1) the annual rate of progression of motor and cognitive symptoms and (2) baseline predictors of different modalities for this progression in early Parkinson's disease (PD) when compared with healthy controls.\nA total of 135 de novo PD and 109 healthy controls (of the De Novo Parkinson cohort) were investigated at baseline and after 24 and 48 months. To delineate motor progression and cognitive decline, the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (MDS-UPDRS III) and the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) were selected. Baseline variables used to predict progression included sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, motor/nonmotor symptoms, polysomnography, MRI, and laboratory biomarkers in serum and CSF.\nSymptoms worsened over 4 years in PD with an annual change of 1.8 points on the MDS-UPDRS III and 0.2 points on the MMSE. Baseline predictors of worse progression of motor symptoms in PD included male sex, orthostatic blood pressure drop, diagnosis of coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension, elevated serum uric acid, and CSF neurofilament light chain. Predictors of cognitive decline in PD included previous heavy alcohol abuse, current diagnoses of diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, elevated periodic limb movement index during sleep, decreased hippocampal volume by MRI, higher baseline levels of uric acid, C-reactive protein, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and glucose levels.\nCardiovascular risk factors, deregulated blood glucose, uric acid metabolism, and inflammation were identified as risk markers for faster disease progression. Our panel of risk parameters needs validation during our continuing follow-up and also in independent patient cohorts. \u00a9 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a debilitating, age-related disorder characterized by selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain substantia nigra (SNc). Dopaminergic neurons originating in the midbrain project to the striatum (Caudate-putamen-CPU). Although studies have suggested that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase \u00bd (ERK \u00bd) in the brain is activated after 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) exposure, to our knowledge no study has yet been done to demonstrate whether such activation occurs in neurons or in glia.\nIn the current study, we utilized both an acute and a repeat dose mouse model of PD using the neurotoxicant MPTP as the causative agent. Immunohistochemical studies using phospho ERK \u00bd antibody suggested that ERK \u00bd activation takes place in the striatum (CPU) and SNc of both animal models. Moreover, double immunolabeling studies using phospho ERK \u00bd and the microglial marker, CD11b or the astrocyte marker, Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) suggested that the phospho ERK \u00bd was present exclusively in the microglia and not in the astrocytes.\nWestern Blot results suggested that there were no alterations in ERK in either MPTPtreated animals or in control animals; however, phospho ERK \u00bd was found to be significantly increased in the striatum and SNc in both acute chronic mouse PD models. Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) immunolabeling revealed significant decreases in dopaminergic neurons in the SNc in both animal models' concomitant with activation of microglia and ERK activation.\nThese observations suggest that ERK activation takes place following MPTP treatment and that activation of ERK occurs primarily in the microglia. The data provided also suggest that ERK activation may be involved in transcriptional activation of microglia following neurotoxicant insults.",

    "abstract": "Diagnostic biomarkers are measures that detect or confirm the presence of a disease or identify individuals with a subtype of the disease. For Parkinson's disease, unlike other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, diagnostic biomarkers remain elusive as none are yet available or approved for clinical use. A biomarker to diagnose early or prodromal Parkinson's disease with high accuracy would significantly enhance clinical practice as well as advance clinical therapeutic trials. Multiple lines of evidence support a role of \u03b1-synuclein in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and hence major ongoing efforts to identify biomarkers for Parkinson's disease are aimed at measuring \u03b1-synuclein in peripheral tissues and biofluids, including cerebrospinal fluid. This work is still in the early stages of biomarker development and has been accompanied by both losses and victories. Here, \u03b1-synuclein in cerebrospinal fluid as a diagnostic marker for Parkinson's disease is reviewed, including measures of total \u03b1-synuclein, oligomeric and phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein, and seeding activity of \u03b1-synuclein.",

    "abstract": "No previous reports have described a case in which deep brain stimulation elicited an acute mood swing from a depressive to manic state simply by switching one side of the bilateral deep brain stimulation electrode on and off. The patient was a 68-year-old woman with a 10-year history of Parkinson's disease. She underwent bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation surgery. After undergoing surgery, the patient exhibited hyperthymia. She was scheduled for admission. On the first day of admission, it was clear that resting tremors in the right limbs had relapsed and her hyperthymia had reverted to depression. It was discovered that the left-side electrode of the deep brain stimulation device was found to be accidentally turned off. As soon as the electrode was turned on, motor impairment improved and her mood switched from depression to mania. The authors speculate that the lateral balance of stimulation plays an important role in mood regulation. The current report provides an intriguing insight into possible mechanisms of mood swing in mood disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease causes a characteristic combination of motor symptoms due to progressive neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The core impairment of dopaminergic neurotransmission has motivated the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in patients with Parkinson's disease to elucidate the role of dopamine in motor control and cognition in humans. Here we review the main insights from functional brain imaging in Parkinson's disease. Task-related fMRI revealed many disease-related alterations in brain activation patterns. However, the interpretation of these findings is complicated by the fact that task-dependent activity is influenced by complex interactions between the amount of dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the task-relevant nuclei, the state of medication, genetic factors and performance. Despite these ambiguities, fMRI studies in Parkinson's disease demonstrated a central role of dopamine in the generation of movement vigour (bradykinesia) and the control of excessive movements (dyskinesia), involving changes of both activity and connectivity of the putamen, premotor and motor regions, and right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). The fMRI studies addressing cognitive flexibility provided convergent evidence for a non-linear, U-shaped, relationship between dopamine levels and performance. The amount of neurodegeneration in the task-relevant dopaminergic nuclei and pharmacological dopamine replacement can therefore move performance either away or towards the task-specific optimum. Dopamine levels also strongly affect processing of reward and punishment for optimal learning. However, further studies are needed for a detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying these effects.",

    "abstract": "Inhaled levodopa is a newly emerging therapeutic option in the treatment of \"off \" symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Its mode of delivery offers more rapid absorption of levodopa and shorter onset of clinical benefit compared to oral formulations, and has been shown to be feasible for use in patients with PD experiencing worse motor function due to declining plasma levodopa levels. Clinical development of this compound is supported by preclinical, Phase I-III, long-term-safety studies and studies in special populations, including otherwise-healthy asthmatics and smokers. These investigations demonstrated that the drug is well tolerated without risk of long-term (up to 1 year) changes in pulmonary function or spirometry measures. The most common side effects among PD patients were a mild cough, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, sputum discoloration, and dyskinesia. Inhaled levodopa offers a different administration method and side-effect profile from the currently available options for rescue therapy for Off periods in PD, though comparative studies have not been performed. The drug is presently under review by the US Food and Drug Administration.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to explore the protective role of curcumin (Cur) in a cell model of Parkinson's disease (PD) and its underlying mechanism.\nIn this study, genes concerned with PD-related keywords were screened within DiGSeE database. The association network between Cur and selected genes was downloaded from STITCH, with the interactions analyzed by STRING. We built a mitochondrial toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced SH-SY5Y cell model of PD. Cell morphology was observed under an electron microscope. MTT assay was applied to detect cell proliferation rate. Western blot assay was conducted to determine the level of apoptotic markers, including cleaved caspase 3, Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xl). Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT) protein levels and dopamine (DA) concentration were identified as dopaminergic neuron markers and measured by western blotting or Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\nCur rescued the toxicity effects of MPP+ on SH-SY5Y cells, by controlling morphological change, promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Of all PD-related genes, HSP90 played an important role in Cur-gene network. HSP90 protein level was elevated by MPP+, whereas Cur could reverse this effect. Silencing of HSP90 significantly attenuated the curative effect introduced by Cur, while HSP90 overexpression enhanced the impact of Cur on PD.\nCur can effectively inhibit the toxic effect of MPP+ on SH-SY5Y cells and significantly reduce the adverse effects of MPP+ on dopaminergic neurons via up-regulation of HSP90.",

It is related to the neurodegenerative processes affecting brain regions responsible for the sleep-wake cycle, the effects of drugs acting on the central nervous system, and the excessive sleep fragmentation of this population.\nTo identify the factors associated with the presence of ES in patients with PD.\nA cross-sectional study was performed involving 88 consecutive patients with PD from an outpatient clinic. Participants underwent clinical interviews with neurologists and psychiatrist, assessment using standardized scales (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Parkinson's disease Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and, for individuals with a diagnosis of RLS/WED, International RLS/WED grading scale), and video-polysomnography.\nThe complaint of ES was observed in 55.6% of the participants. The main related factors were: the presence of psychotic disorder, the presence of anxiety disorder, and the use of dopaminergic agonists. No higher prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea and any other sleep disorder was observed in PD group with ES in comparison with the group without ES.\nPD patients present a high prevalence of ES, and some factors, different from those observed in the general population, seem to have a greater impact in this group of patients.\nRLS/ WED: Restless legs syndrome; Willis-Eckbom Disease ES: Excessive sleepiness.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by Lewy pathology and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Lewy pathology mainly consists of abnormal aggregates of \u03b1-synuclein, which play a pivotal role in PD pathophysiology. However, the complexity of PD leads to clinical challenges, and there are still no treatments to halt or slow the neurodegenerative process. Resveratrol (RV) is a natural polyphenol compound with multiple biological activities, which has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects on several neurological diseases. Here we first provided evidence that RV treatment alleviated motor and cognitive deficits in the A53T \u03b1-synuclein mouse model of PD in a dose-dependent manner. The beneficial effects of RV against PD resulted from inhibiting \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and cytotoxicity, lowering the levels of total \u03b1-synuclein and oligomers, reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. These findings suggest that RV has promising therapeutic potential for PD and other synucleinopathies.",

    "abstract": "The law of intersegmental coordination (Borghese et al. 1996) may be altered in pathological conditions. Here we investigated the contribution of the basal ganglia (BG) and the cerebellum to lower limb intersegmental coordination by inspecting the plane's orientation and other parameters pertinent to this law in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) or cerebellar ataxia (CA). We also applied a mathematical model that successfully accounts for the intersegmental law of coordination observed in control subjects (Barliya et al. 2009). In the present study, we compared the planarity index (PI), covariation plane (CVP) orientation, and CVP orientation predicted by the model in 11 PD patients, 8 CA patients, and two groups of healthy subjects matched for age, height, weight, and gender to each patient group (Ctrl_PD and Ctrl_CA). Controls were instructed to alter their gait speed to match those of their respective patient group. PD patients were examined after overnight withdrawal of anti-parkinsonian medications (PD-off-med) and then on medication (PD-on-med). PI was above 96% in all gait conditions in all groups suggesting that the law of intersegmental coordination is preserved in both BG and cerebellar pathology. However, the measured and predicted CVP orientations rotated in PD-on-med and PD-off-med compared with Ctrl_PD and in CA vs. Ctrl_CA. These rotations caused by PD and CA were in opposite directions suggesting differences in the roles of the BG and cerebellum in intersegmental coordination during human locomotion. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Kinematic and muscular synergies may have a role in overcoming motor redundancies, which may be reflected in intersegmental covariation. Basal ganglia and cerebellar networks were suggested to be involved in crafting and modulating synergies. We thus compared intersegmental coordination in Parkinson's disease and cerebellar disease patients and found opposite effects in some aspects. Further research integrating muscle activities as well as biomechanical and neural control modeling are needed to account for these findings.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is one of the most important processes involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The current concept of neuroinflammation comprises an inflammation process, which occurs in the central nervous system due to molecules released from brain-resident and/or blood-derived immune cells. Furthermore, the evidence of the contribution of systemic delivered molecules to the disease pathogenesis, such as the gut microbiota composition, has been increasing during the last years. Under physiological conditions, microglia and astrocytes support the well-being and well-function of the brain through diverse functions, including neurotrophic factor secretion in both intact and injured brain. On the other hand, genes that cause PD are expressed in astrocytes and microglia, shifting their neuroprotective role to a pathogenic one, contributing to disease onset and progression. In addition, growth factors are a subset of molecules that promote cellular survival, differentiation and maturation, which are critical signaling factors promoting the communication between cells, including neurons and blood-derived immune cells. We summarize the potential targeting of astrocytes and microglia and the systemic contribution of the gut microbiota in neuroinflammation process archived in PD.",

    "abstract": "The impact of systemic inflammation in nigral dopaminergic cell loss remains unclear. Here, we have investigated the role of peripheral inflammation induced by systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in the MPTP-based model of Parkinson's disease. Brain inflammation, microglia and astroglia activation, disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system were evaluated in response to i.p. injection of LPS, MPTP or the combination of both. Our results showed that combinative treatment exacerbates microglia activation and enhances (i) the appearance of galectin-3-positive microglia, recently identified as microglial disease-associated phenotypic marker, (ii) the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, (iii) the occurrence of A1 neurotoxic astrocytes, (iv) the breakdown of the BBB, and (v) the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Microglia activation was triggered earlier than other degenerative events, suggesting that over-activation of microglia (including different polarization states) may induce dopaminergic neuron loss by itself, initiating the endless cycle of inflammation/degeneration. Our study revitalizes the importance of peripheral inflammation as a potential risk factor for Parkinson's disease and raises the possibility of using new anti-inflammatory therapies to improve the course of neurodegenerative diseases, including those directly aimed at modulating the deleterious activity of disease-associated microglia.",

    "abstract": "The more than 30-year-old Calcium hypothesis postulates that dysregulation in calcium dependent processes in the aging brain contributes to its increased vulnerability and this concept has been extended to Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Central to the hypothesis is that increased levels of intracellular calcium develop and contributes to neuronal demise. We have studied the impact on cells encountering a gradual build-up of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein, which is a central process to Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. Surprisingly, we observed a yet unrecognized phase characterized by a reduced cytosolic calcium in cellular and neuronal models of Parkinson's disease, caused by \u03b1-synuclein aggregates activating the endoplasmic calcium ATPase, SERCA. Counteracting the initial phase with low calcium rescues the subsequent degenerative phase with increased calcium and cell death - and demonstrates this early phase initiates decisive degenerative signals. In this review, we discuss our findings in relation to literature on calcium dysregulation in Parkinson's disease and dementia.",

    "abstract": "Autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson disease encompasses thermoregulatory symptoms and was first noted by Gowers in the late 19th century when he described abnormal temperature sensation and sweating in Parkinson disease patients. These thermoregulatory symptoms became more recognized in the postlevodopa era when Parkinson disease patients were more readily tested with objective autonomic function tests. Objective thermoregulatory testing in Parkinson disease reveals deficits of sweating and vasomotor tone which often correlate with the severity of other autonomic deficits. Tests of thermoregulatory function can also be used to differentiate Parkinson disease from other neurodegenerative disorders. The pathophysiology of thermoregulatory dysfunction in Parkinson disease encompasses both central and peripheral mechanisms; involvement of the brainstem and hypothalamus with alpha-synuclein pathology is well recognized with increasing evidence of peripheral neuropathy in Parkinson disease that influences thermoregulation. Medications used to treat Parkinson disease also affect thermoregulatory symptoms. Disorders of thermoregulation significantly affect the quality of life for patients and their caregivers and can be severe and even life threatening, such as in the parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The hyperkinetic symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) are associated with the ensembles of interacting oscillators that cause excess or abnormal synchronous behavior within the Basal Ganglia (BG) circuitry. Delayed feedback stimulation is a closed loop technique shown to suppress this synchronous oscillatory activity. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) via delayed feedback is known to destabilize the complex intermittent synchronous states. Computational models of the BG network are often introduced to investigate the effect of delayed feedback high frequency stimulation on partially synchronized dynamics. In this study, we develop a reduced order model of four interacting nuclei of the BG as well as considering the Thalamo-Cortical local effects on the oscillatory dynamics. This model is able to capture the emergence of 34 Hz beta band oscillations seen in the Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings of the PD state. Train of high frequency pulses in a delayed feedback stimulation has shown deficiencies such as strengthening the synchronization in case of highly fluctuating neuronal activities, increasing the energy consumed as well as the incapability of activating all neurons in a large-scale network. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a new feedback control variable based on the filtered and linearly delayed LFP recordings. The proposed control variable is then used to modulate the frequency of the stimulation signal rather than its amplitude. In strongly coupled networks, oscillations reoccur as soon as the amplitude of the stimulus signal declines. Therefore, we show that maintaining a fixed amplitude and modulating the frequency might ameliorate the desynchronization process, increase the battery lifespan and activate substantial regions of the administered DBS electrode. The charge balanced stimulus pulse itself is embedded with a delay period between its charges to grant robust desynchronization with lower amplitudes needed. The efficiency of the proposed Frequency Adjustment Stimulation (FAS) protocol in a delayed feedback method might contribute to further investigation of DBS modulations aspired to address a wide range of abnormal oscillatory behavior observed in neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "The required coefficient of friction (RCOF) is frequently reported in the literature as an indicator of slip propensity, a consequence of the collisional aspect of legged locomotion. Little is known about the RCOF in pathological gait. Therefore, this study aimed to quantify the RCOF in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) and freezing of gait (FOG) during the OFF-pharma phase, and to investigate the interplay between RCOF parameters and ankle kinematic and kinetic gait variables. Fourteen subjects with PD and 14 healthy age-matched subjects were instructed to walk barefoot at self-selected speed over a force platform. The RCOF curve was obtained as the ratio between the tangential and vertical ground reaction forces. Then, the following discrete variables were identified: P1COF (the peak at the loading response phase), V1COF (the valley at midstance phase) and P2COF (the peak at push-off phase). Stepwise multiple regressions were applied to observe the influence of the gait speed and ankle kinematic and kinetic gait variables on RCOF variables. In subjects with PD and FOG the gait speed is a predictor of the RCOF in the loading response phase; plantarflexion and the plantarflexion moment are strong predictors of the RCOF in midstance; finally, push-off power is a predictor of RCOF increasing in the push-off phase. These results characterized the biomechanical strategies adopted by subjects with PD and FOG during gait in order to avoid falls.",

    "abstract": "Arbutin has been shown to have antioxidant and free-radical scavenging properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of arbutin administration on behavioral impairment, and oxidative and nitrosative stress in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD).\nPD model was developed by 4 intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of MPTP (20 mg/kg) with 2 h intervals in mice. Experimental groups received once daily injection of saline as vehicle (control group) or arbutin (50 mg/kg, i.p.) one week before MPTP injections and this protocol was continued seven days post lesion. Behavioral deficits were evaluated using locomotion test, hanging wire test and forepaw stride length. Parameters indicating the oxidation levels including lipid peroxidation marker (TBARS), nitrite, protein carbonyl levels and antioxidant activity including ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were assessed in serum and midbrain samples.\nTreatment with arbutin improved motor functions in an MPTP-induced PD model compared to control group (p<0.001). Mice treated with MPTP showed reduced levels of FRAP (p<0.001) and increased levels of TBARS (p<0.001), nitrite (p<0.001) and protein carbonyl (p<0.01), compared to the control group. In contrast to the MPTP group, arbutin treatment decreased the levels of TBARS (p<0.05), nitrite (p<0.05), protein carbonyl (p<0.05), and increased FRAP levels (p<0.05) in mice with PD.\nThese findings suggest that arbutin attenuates the behavioral impairment and oxidative stress in a PD animal model.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Neuroinflammation induced by over-activation of microglia leads to the death of dopaminergic neurons in the pathogenesis of PD. Therefore, downregulation of microglial activation may aid in the treatment of PD. Polydatin (PLD) has been reported to pass through the blood-brain barrier and protect against motor degeneration in the SN. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of PLD in the treatment of PD remain unclear. The present study aimed to determine whether PLD protects against dopaminergic neurodegeneration by inhibiting the activation of microglia in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PD. Our findings indicated that PLD treatment protected dopaminergic neurons and ameliorated motor dysfunction by inhibiting microglial activation and the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, PLD treatment significantly increased levels of p-AKT, p-GSK-3\u03b2",

    "abstract": "Falls are common in Parkinson's disease so any intervention that reduced falls risk would be of value. One potential intervention is the use of cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEi) drugs.\nTo establish the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for fall rates to inform the effect estimate for sample size calculations of future clinical trials.\nWe performed a Delphi study assembling a panel of experts in Parkinson's disease from academic and clinical medicine in order to reach a consensus of opinion. Responses from a panel were summarised and resent to the group, until consensus was reached.\n780 clinicians, who had been caring for people with Parkinson's for an average of 14 years, were contacted via three routes. The median (Interquartile range (IQR)) MCID after round 1 was 25% (IQR 20-30%) which equates to the prevention of 5 (IQR 4-6) falls per year. Increasing consensus after round two confirmed the MCID of 25%, narrowing the (IQ) range to 20%-25%. This was unchanged when the panel were shown the number of participants that would need to be recruited to a clinical trial in order to achieve this difference.\nWe have established that an expert panel of PD specialists consider that an intervention that demonstrated a 25% (IQR 20-25%) relative reduction in falls rate would be clinically meaningful. This estimate can be used to help determine the sample size for any future clinical trial.",

    "abstract": "This study charts the evolution of the scientific literature on Parkinson's disease (PD) from 1983 to 2017 to inform communities of scientists, physicians, patients, caregivers and politicians concerned with PD. Articles published in journals indexed in the Science Citation Index-Expanded database of the Web of Science were retrieved and analyzed in seven five-year periods: 1983-1987, 1988-1992, 1993-1997, 1998-2002, 2003-2007, 2008-2012 and 2013-2017. Over 35 years the number of research papers on PD increased 33-fold: 885 papers in 1983-1987 to 29,972 in 2013-2017. At the same time the number of countries contributing to PD research increased from 37 to 131. The USA was the most prolific country throughout, followed by several European (UK, Germany, Italy and France) and English-speaking (Canada and Australia) countries. By 2003, several Asian countries (China, South Korea, India and Turkey) emerged with rapid increases in publications related to PD. By 2013-2017, China surpassed all but the USA to rank 2nd globally in productivity. Despite an increase from 4 to 22 African countries publishing PD research from 1983 to 2017, most were either unproductive or contributed \u22645 papers in each five-year period. There has also been a 12-fold increase in the number of journals (232-2824) containing papers on PD. In 2013-2017 three PD-focused journals (Parkinsonism & Related Disorders, Movement Disorders and Journal of Parkinson's Disease) contained 6.8% of all PD papers while a large majority (82.5%) of journals published\u202f\u2264\u202f10 papers. This quantitative study complements the numerous extant qualitative reviews to provide a global perspective on PD research.",

    "abstract": "Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) parameters, for example the frequency of stimulation, seem to affect speech and voice aspects. However, this influence is not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact of low- and high-frequency STN-DBS on voice and speech for people with Parkinson's disease.\nNineteen individuals with Parkinson's disease who received bilateral STN-DBS were assessed for motor performance (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III), perceptual evaluation of voice (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, strain, and instability [GRBASI]), dysarthria assessment, and computerized acoustic analysis of voice upon receiving low-frequency (60 Hz) and high-frequency (130 Hz) STN-DBS.\nIn the GRBASI protocol, asthenia, and instability were significantly better at 130 Hz of stimulation. In the dysarthria evaluation, the phonation aspect, articulation, and grade of dysarthria showed deterioration at the same high-frequency condition. There was no significant difference for any vocal acoustic measures.\nThe high-frequency of STN-DBS may affect speech and voice differently, leading to an amelioration of the vocal production, but with adverse effects in the speech control.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to characterize peripheral inflammatory markers in patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD) and to explore whether these markers contribute to motor and non-motor symptoms. We collected serum from patients with early PD (n\u202f=\u202f58) and from healthy control subjects (n\u202f=\u202f20). The following inflammatory markers were measured: interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. The Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part 3 and Hoehn and Yahr stage were used to assess motor symptoms, and the Non-motor Symptoms Scale, the Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and the Composite Autonomic Symptom Score 31 (COMPASS-31) were used to assess non-motor symptoms. The levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, and IL-6 were higher in the PD group than in the control group. However, only IL-1\u03b2 among those markers remained significant after Bonferroni correction (P\u202f=\u202f0.024). In the PD group, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels correlated positively with the COMPASS-31 score (r\u202f=\u202f0.277, P\u202f=\u202f0.035), whereas no correlation was found between the other inflammatory marker levels and motor or non-motor symptoms. Among the domains of the COMPASS-31, the IL-10 levels correlated only with the gastrointestinal domain (r\u202f=\u202f0.358, P\u202f=\u202f0.006). Our results suggest increased peripheral inflammation in the early stage of PD, but the role of inflammation in motor and non-motor symptoms is unclear. Although we found a correlation between IL-10 levels and gastrointestinal symptoms, this finding may simply reflect a protective response against inflammatory processes associated with the disease.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenic dysphagia is caused by decreased muscle mass and muscle weakness in the swallowing muscles that occurs because of sarcopenia. The key to treating sarcopenic dysphagia is combined therapy with rehabilitation and aggressive nutrition management. However, to our knowledge, no studies based in a home medical care setting have yet been published.\nA 72-year-old man with Parkinson's disease developed sarcopenia and possible sarcopenic dysphagia during hospitalization for drug adjustment. At discharge, the patient's body weight was 39.0\u2005kg (-33.8%/4 months, body mass index: 15.3\u2005kg/m\nSarcopenic dysphagia may be a complication of Parkinson's disease, and home-based combined therapy with rehabilitation and aggressive nutrition management may be effective for treating this condition.",

    "abstract": "In 2011, Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) conducted a report on deep brain stimulation (DBS) for parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and provided a reference list of studies published between January 1, 2009 and August 19, 2011. The current report aims to summarize evidence regarding the clinical and cost-effectiveness, as well as guidelines for the use of DBS in the treatment of PD. This report is, therefore, an update and upgrade to the previous CADTH report on this topic and may help knowledge users with purchasing decisions of DBS devices as a therapeutic intervention for patients with PD.",
