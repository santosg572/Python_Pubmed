    "abstract": "Red raspberry is a kind of fruit with high nutritional values. To evaluate the comprehensive quality of 24 red raspberry varieties in Northeast China, physicochemical properties, bioactive compounds and sensory characteristics were measured, followed by principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA). Altogether, eight important property indexes for processing attributes were selected out using PCA, including titratable acidity (TAC), sugar-acid ratio (SAR), pH, length, diameter, weight, sucrose and citric acid. Six individual sugars, including l-rhamnose monohydrate, fructose, glucose, sucrose, maltose and d-trehalose anhydrous, as well as eight organic acids, including oxalic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, \u03b1-ketoglutaric acid, lactic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid and succinic acid, were identified in red raspberry. The two main clusters according to individual sugar, organic acids and SAR indicated that varieties including 'European red', 'DNS9', 'Bulgaskc', 'Canby' and 'Samodiva' were suitable for fresh-eating or processing to juice or other products directly because they had suitable SAR; other varieties with relatively low SAR were unsuitable for fresh-eating and need to adjust their excessive sour taste during processing.",

    "abstract": "Preparation of an in-situ gel containing lycopene and raspberry plant formulation and analysis of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects is described. Lycopene is known for its anticancer and antioxidant activity. It induces apoptosis, thereby reducing the cancer cells, and also reduces the injury of cells due to oxidative activity. Similarly, raspberry also contains antioxidants properties which can help to reduce oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. This study includes extracts containing 25% of Raspberry and 10% lycopene, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, Carbopol, sodium chloride, and distilled water. This in-situ gel was then tested for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory assay using DPPH (2, diphenyl 1-picryl- hydrazyl- hydrate) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), antioxidant assay revealed that the inhibition percentage was more with 50 \u00b5L (61.3) of gel and anti-inflammatory assay showed significant results with 10 \u00b5L (90.2) of gel. In-situ gel containing lycopene and Raspberry has significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity.",

    "abstract": "Red imported fire ants (RIFA) are an alien invasive pest that can cause serious ecosystem damage. Timely detection, location and elimination of RIFA nests can further control the spread of RIFA. In order to accurately locate the RIFA nests, this paper proposes an improved deep learning method of YOLOv4. The specific methods were as follows: 1) We improved GhostBottleNeck (GBN) and replaced the original CSP block of YOLOv4, so as to compress the network scale and reduce the consumption of computing resources. 2) An Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism was introduced into GBN to enhance the feature extraction ability of the model. 3) We used Equalized Focal Loss to reduce the loss value of background noise. 4) We increased and improved the upsampling operation of YOLOv4 to enhance the understanding of multi-layer semantic features to the whole network. 5) CutMix was added in the model training process to improve the model's ability to identify occluded objects. The parameters of improved YOLOv4 were greatly reduced, and the abilities to locate and extract edge features were enhanced. Meanwhile, we used an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to collect images of RIFA nests with different heights and scenes, and we made the RIFA nests (RIFAN) airspace dataset. On the RIFAN dataset, through qualitative analysis of the evaluation indicators, mean average precision (MAP) of the improved YOLOv4 model reaches 99.26%, which is 5.9% higher than the original algorithm. Moreover, compared with Faster R-CNN, SSD and other algorithms, improved YOLOv4 has achieved excellent results. Finally, we transplanted the model to the embedded device Raspberry Pi 4B and assembled it on the UAV, using the model's lightweight and high-efficiency features to achieve flexible and fast flight detection of RIFA nests.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of ES on the cell structure and function of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus and then compare the effects of ES and heat treatment (HT) on microbial inactivation and flavour composition in honey raspberry wine. First, we found that the inactivation effect of ES treatment on the three microorganisms was significantly influenced by the voltage intensity. The degree of damage to the cellular structures and functions of the three microorganisms increased with increasing voltage. Second, the environment in which the microorganisms were present significantly influenced the ES pasteurisation effect. Pasteurisation by ES was better when the three microorganisms were in honey raspberry wine than in saline. Finally, the total number of colonies in honey raspberry wine was reduced from 4.50 to 2.03 log colony forming units/mL after ES treatment, and the wine had good stability during storage (84\u00a0days at 4\u00a0\u00b0C). In the honey raspberry wine, the contents of the main flavour substances (ketones and esters) did not change significantly after ES treatment, but HT decreased the content of esters and ketones by 13.5\u00a0% and 75.4\u00a0%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Dark septate endophytes (DSEs) can form reciprocal symbioses with most terrestrial plants, providing them with mineral nutrients in exchange for photosynthetic products. Although the mechanism of plant-DSEs is well understood at the transcriptional level, little is known about their post-transcriptional regulation, and microRNAs (miRNAs) for the symbiotic process of DSE infestation of raspberry have not been identified. In this study, we comprehensively identified the miRNAs of DSE-infested raspberry symbiosis using Illumina sequencing. A total of 361 known miRNAs and 95 novel miRNAs were identified in the roots. Similar to other dicotyledons, most of the identified raspberry miRNAs were 21\u2009nt in length. Thirty-seven miRNAs were differentially expressed during colonization after inoculation with ",

    "abstract": "Single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi make it easy to control hardware setups for laboratory experiments. GPIOs and expansion boards (HATs) give access to a whole range of sensor and control hardware. However, controlling such hardware can be challenging, when many experimental setups run in parallel and the time component is critical. LabNet is a C++ optimized control layer software to give access to the Raspberry Pi connected hardware over a simple network protocol. LabNet was developed to be suitable for time-critical operations, and to be simple to expand. It leverages the actor model to simplify multithreading programming and to increase modularity. The message protocol is implemented in Protobuf and offers performance, small message size, and supports a large number of programming languages on the client side. It shows good performance compared to locally executed tools like Bpod, pyControl, or Autopilot and reaches sub-millisecond range in network communication latencies. LabNet can monitor and react simultaneously to up to 14 pairs of digital inputs, without increasing latencies. LabNet itself does not provide support for the design of experimental tasks. This is left to the client. LabNet can be used for general automation in experimental laboratories with its control PC located at some distance. LabNet is open source and under continuing development.",

    "abstract": "Advances in biomedical and engineering fields have greatly increased the need for understanding of soft structures. Soft materials such as gelatin and gelatin-based hydrogels have grown in popularity for use in a wide variety of applications including tissue engineering, biofabrication, and organ transplantation. With hydrogel structures being used in such demanding applications, it is crucial to properly characterize the dynamic behavior of these soft structures. Although there have been major improvements in measurement technology for determining the mechanical properties of soft, translucent materials, it remains quite challenging to reliably measure the Young's and shear moduli of these materials in a way that remains straightforward, low-cost, and non-contact. This research aims to address the weaknesses in modern measurement methods and develop a system suitable for characterizing the elastic moduli of soft materials that requires only four, inexpensive, off-the-shelf components. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi, stepping motor, and an inexpensive camera, the Young's and shear moduli of a gelatin column is measured five times. The standard deviation between measurement was observed to be less than 0.15% with high accuracy having an error of less than 4.6% when compared to relatively expensive, conventional measurement techniques.",

    "abstract": "The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is widely used as a promising high-throughput model organism in neurobehavioral research. The mobility of zebrafish can be dissected into multiple behavior endpoints to assess its neurobehavioral performance. However, such facilities on the market are expensive and clumsy to be used in laboratories. Here, we designed a low-cost, automatic zebrafish behavior assay apparatus, barely without unintentional human operational errors. The data acquisition part, composed of Raspberry Pi and HQ Camera, automatically performs video recording and data storage. Then, the data processing process is also on the Raspberry Pi. Water droplets and inner wall reflection of multi-well cell culture plates (used for placing zebrafish) will affect the accuracy of object recognition. And during the rapid movement of zebrafish, the probability of zebrafish tracking loss increased significantly. Thus, ROI region and related thresholds were set, and the Kalman filter algorithm was performed to estimate the best position of zebrafish in each frame. In addition, all functions of this device are realized by the custom-written behavior analysis algorithm, which makes the optimization of the setup more efficient. Furthermore, this setup was also used to analyze the behavioral changes of zebrafish under different concentrations of alcohol exposure to verify the reliability and accuracy. The alcohol exposure induced an inverted U-shape dose-dependent behavior change in zebrafish, which was consistent with previous studies, showcasing that the data obtained from the setup proposed in this study are accurate and reliable. Finally, the setup was comprehensively assessed by evaluating the accuracy of zebrafish detection (precision, recall, F-score), and predicting alcohol concentration by XGBoost. In conclusion, this study provides a simple, and low-cost package for the determination of multiple behavioral parameters of zebrafish with high accuracy, which could be easily adapted for various other fields.",

    "abstract": "A wireless impedance monitoring system, called SSeL-Pi, is designed to have cheap, mobile, and handy practical features as compared to wired commercial impedance analyzers. A Raspberry Pi platform impedance sensor node is designed to measure signals at a low-frequency range of up to 100 kHz. The low-frequency impedance measurement via the proposed node has been combined with a new PZT interface technique for measuring local responses sensitive to structural damage. The new PZT interface can work as a surface-mounted or embedded sensor, and its local dynamic characteristics are numerically analyzed to pre-determine an effective impedance resonant frequency range of less than 100 kHz. Next, a software scheme was designed to visualize the input/output parameters of the proposed SSeL-Pi system (i.e., Raspberry Pi platform and PZT interface) and automate signal acquisition procedures of the impedance sensor node. The calibration for impedance signals obtained from the proposed system was performed by a series of procedures, from acquiring real and imaginary impedance to adjusting them with respect to a commercial impedance analyzer (HIOKI-3532). The feasibility of the wireless impedance monitoring system was experimentally evaluated for PZT interfaces that were subjected to various compressive loadings. The consistent results analyzed from signals measured by the SSeL-Pi and HIOKI 3532 systems were observed. Additionally, the strong relationships between impedance features (frequency shift and RMSD index) and compressive stresses of the PZT interfaces showed the potential for axial force/stress variation monitoring in real structures using the Raspberry Pi platform impedance sensor node and developed PZT interface.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, raspberry breeding has shifted its emphasis from agronomic performance to characteristics related to the sensory qualities of the fruit and its potential health benef its. The therapeutic and preventive properties of raspberries are related to their biochemical composition. In this regard, the purpose of the work was to determine the content of macro- and micronutrients in fruits of different cultivars of repair raspberry using modern high-tech analytical methods and the selection of genetic sources of the analyzed elements for further breeding. The objects of the research were 17 cultivars of repair raspberry of different ecological and geographical origin from the genetic plant bioresource collection of FSBSO ARHCBAN. It was found that the ash residue of berries contains 12 major elements, which form the following descending series: K > P > Mg \u2265 Mo > Ca > S \u2265 Ni > Zn > Mn > Se > Fe \u2265 Co. The largest proportion of ash residue in raspberry fruits is K. Depending on the cultivar, its quantity averaged from 12.81 wt % (Samorodok and Karamelka) to 22.37 wt % (Atlant). The minimum K content was observed in the ash of the Carolina cultivar (5.62 wt %), while in berries of this cultivar Mg (2.91), Ca (2.62) and Zn (0.14 wt %) accumulated above average. Among the group of early maturing cultivars, the cultivar Yubileinaya Kulikova stands out with a high content of Mo (4.63), Ca (2.19), Fe (0.25) and Co (0.21 wt %). The cultivar Pingvin is characterized by a high content of K (22.65) and Se (0.31 wt %). The medium maturity cultivar Samorodok is characterized by a higher content of P (4.08), S (0.47), Ni (0.51) and Zn (0.26 wt %). Among the late maturing cultivars, the cultivar Poranna Rosa stands out with the preferential accumulation of nine elements: Mg (2.98), P (4.42), S (0.36), K (20.34), Ca (1.71), Mn (0.14), Co (0.13), Se (0.21) and Mo (3.08 wt %). Correlation relationships between the elements have been established. Samples with the highest accumulation of macro- and microelements in berries represent genetic sources for further selection of raspberry for improvement of the mineral composition of fruits.\n\u0412

    "abstract": "The present study was conducted to determine the effects of spray-dried raspberry powder (SDRP) (CONTROL, 1.0%, 2.0%, and 3.0%) as a natural antioxidant, antimicrobial, and colorant on physicochemical properties, lipid oxidation, discoloration, and microbial quality of vacuum-packed (VP) ground beef during chilled storage at 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00b0C for 18\u00a0days. By incorporating SDRP into VP ground beef pH, lipid oxidation (TBARS), lightness, and hue angle (h\u00b0) values decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01), while redness (a*) and chroma (C*) values improved (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). SDRP treatments had higher redness, more stable color, and lower pH and TBARS values during storage in a dose-dependent manner (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), demonstrating that SDRP had a preventive effect on lipid oxidation and discoloration. The combination of vacuum packaging with SDRP generally resulted in lower bacterial growth during storage. These results demonstrated that 2% or 3% SDRP treatment has promising potential as an effective strategy to achieve oxidative and microbial stability and overcome discoloration in VP fresh meats.",

    "abstract": "Despite the growing interest in the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as a potential biometric for subject identification and the recent advances in the use of deep learning (DL) models to study neurological signals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), electroretinogram (ERG), and electromyogram (EMG), there has been a lack of exploration in the use of state-of-the-art DL models for EEG-based subject identification tasks owing to the high variability in EEG features across sessions for an individual subject. In this paper, we explore the use of state-of-the-art DL models such as ResNet, Inception, and EEGNet to realize EEG-based biometrics on the BED dataset, which contains EEG recordings from 21 individuals. We obtain promising results with an accuracy of 63.21%, 70.18%, and 86.74% for Resnet, Inception, and EEGNet, respectively, while the previous best effort reported accuracy of 83.51%. We also demonstrate the capabilities of these models to perform EEG biometric tasks in real-time by developing a portable, low-cost, real-time Raspberry Pi-based system that integrates all the necessary steps of subject identification from the acquisition of the EEG signals to the prediction of identity while other existing systems incorporate only parts of the whole system.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK; [4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone]) is a synthetic flavoring agent and dietary supplement for weight control. This study investigated the metabolic signature of oral doses of RK that prevent weight gain or promote loss of righting reflex (LORR) in C57Bl/6J mice. Daily RK 200\u00a0mg/kg prevented high-fat diet (HFD; 45% Kcal fat) fed weight gain (\u223c8% reduction) over 35 days. RNA-seq of inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT) performed in males revealed 12 differentially expressed genes. Apelin (Apln) and potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily C member (Kcnc3) expression were elevated with HFD and normalized with RK dosing, which was confirmed by qPCR. Acute RK 640\u00a0mg/kg produced a LORR with a <5\u00a0min onset with a >30\u00a0min duration. Acute RK 200\u00a0mg/kg increased gene expression of Apln, Kcnc3, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), but reduced acetyl-COA carboxylase (Acc1) and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (Nqo1) in inguinal WAT. Acute RK 640\u00a0mg/kg elevated interleukin 6 (Il 6) and heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1) expression, but reduced Nrf2 in inguinal and epididymal WAT. Our findings suggest that RK has a dose-dependent metabolic signature in WAT associated with either weight control or LORR.",

    "abstract": "Digital imaging permits the quantitation of many experiments, such as microbiological growth assays, but laboratory digital imaging systems can be expensive and too specialised. The Raspberry Pi camera platform makes automated, controlled imaging affordable with accessible customisation. When combined with open source software and open-source 3D printed hardware, the control over image quality and capture of this platform permits the rapid development of novel instrumentation. Here we present \"PiRamid\", a compact, portable, and inexpensive enclosure for autonomous imaging both in the laboratory and in the field. The modular three-piece 3D printed design makes it easy to incorporate different camera systems or lighting configurations (e.g., single wavelength LED for fluorescence). The enclosed design allows complete control of illumination unlike a conventional digital camera or smartphone, on a tripod or handheld, under ambient lighting. The stackable design permits rapid sample addition or camera focus adjustment, with a corresponding change in magnification and resolution. The entire unit is small enough to fit within a microbiological incubator, and cheap enough (\u223c\u00a3100) to scale out for larger parallel experiments. Simply, Python scripts fully automate illumination and image capture for small-scale experiments with an \u223c110\u00d785 mm area at 70-90 \u00b5m resolution. We demonstrate the versatility of PiRamid by capturing time-resolved, quantitative image data for a wide range of assays. Bacterial growth kinetics was captured for conventional microbiology (agar Petri dishes), 3D printed custom microbiology labware and microfluidic microbiology. To illustrate application beyond microbiology, we demonstrate time-lapse imaging of crystal growth and degradation of salad leaves. Minor modifications permit epi-illumination by addition of a LED ring to the camera module. We conclude that PiRamid permits inexpensive digital capture and quantitation of a wide range of experiments by time-lapse imaging to simplify both laboratory and field imaging.",

    "abstract": "Phytophthora species are primary causal agents of raspberry root rot and wilting complex (RRWC), a disease complex that is of major concern to raspberry producers worldwide. Accurate identification of the causal agents is a first step for effective disease management. Advancements in molecular diagnostics can facilitate the detection of multiple pathogen species associated with this disease complex. We developed multiplex targeted-sequencing methods using degenerate primers for heat shock protein 90, elongation factor 1\u03b1 and \u03b2-tubulin genes to identify Phytophthora species causing RRWC. One hundred and twenty-eight isolates recovered during 2018 to 2020 from diverse fields in major raspberry growing areas of British Columbia (BC) were sequenced and identified by comparing with known reference sequences of 142 Phytophthora species, 111 Pythium species, and nine Phytopythium species in the NCBI database. This multiplex targeted-sequencing method was highly specific and identified two species of Phytophthora associated with RRWC. These were P. rubi (85% of isolates) and P. gonapodyides (15% of isolates). Phytophthora rubi was predominantly isolated from the cultivars 'Chemainus' (51%), 'Rudi' (27%) and 'Meeker' (15%), whereas P. gonapodyides was predominately isolated from the moderately resistant cultivar 'Cascade Bounty'. Pathogenicity studies on intact plants and detached leaves confirmed that P. rubi and P. gonapodyides can cause symptoms of RRWC on raspberry, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. gonapodyides as a causal agent of RRWC on raspberry in BC. This study provides novel insights into the identification and species composition of Phytophthora associated with RRWC in raspberry production systems.",

    "abstract": "As demonstrated by us earlier and by other researchers, a diet containing freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB) inhibits DNA damage and carcinogenesis in animal models. We tested the hypothesis that the inhibition of DNA damage by BRB is due, in part, to the enhancement of DNA repair capacity evaluated in the human HeLa cell extract system, an established in vitro system for the assessment of cellular DNA repair activity. The pre-treatment of intact HeLa cells with BRB extracts (BRBE) enhances the nucleotide excision repair (NER) of a bulky deoxyguanosine adduct derived from the polycyclic aromatic carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BP-dG) by ~24%. The NER activity of an oxidatively-derived non-bulky DNA lesion, guanidinohydantoin (Gh), is also enhanced by ~24%, while its base excision repair activity is enhanced by only ~6%. Western Blot experiments indicate that the expression of selected, NER factors is also increased by BRBE treatment by ~73% (XPA), ~55% (XPB), while its effects on XPD was modest (<14%). These results demonstrate that BRBE significantly enhances the NER yields of a bulky and a non-bulky DNA lesion, and that this effect is correlated with an enhancement of expression of the critically important NER factor XPA and the helicase XPB, but not the helicase XPD.",

    "abstract": "Polyphenols, ubiquitous in plant-originated foods, exhibit multifarious health benefits but are notorious for their low bioavailability. As the majority of polyphenols enter the colon where they are metabolized into the more bioavailable metabolites with multifarious bioactivities, gut microbiota composition is critical for realizing the health benefits of polyphenols. Black raspberries (BRB) are highly abundant in health-promoting but poorly absorbable polyphenols, primarily ellagitannins and anthocyanins. This study aimed to dissect the bilateral interactions between polyphenols and gut microbiotas of diverse origins. Using an optimized extraction procedure, BRB polyphenols were first comprehensively characterized by UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. Next, in vitro anaerobic fermentations with microbiota from human adults, infants, rats, and mice were conducted for comparison of phenolic profile (by metabolomics) and microbiota composition (by 16S rDNA sequencing) before and after fermentation. Bioinformatics analysis further revealed unique polyphenol-microbiota interactions and identified several bacterial species that could potentially produce bioactive and bioavailable phenolic metabolites following BRB consumption.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. Raspberry fruits contain polyphenols which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we used molecular imprinting technology to efficiently isolate phenolic components from the raspberry ethyl acetate extracts. Six phenolic components (ellagic acid, tiliroside, kaempferol-3-o-rutoside, gallic acid, ferulic acid and vanillic acid) were identified by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis. Molecular docking was used to predict the anti-inflammatory effects and anti-Alzheimer's potential of these isolated compounds, which showed a good binding ability to diseases and related proteins. However, the binding energy and docking fraction of ellagic acid, tiliroside, and kaempferol-3-o-rutoside were better than those of gallic acid, ferulic acid and vanillic acid. Additionally, by studying the effects of these six phenolic components on the LPS-induced secretion of inflammatory mediators in murine microglial (BV2) cells, it was further demonstrated that they were all capable of inhibiting the secretion of NO, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 to a certain extent. However, ellagic acid, tiliroside, and kaempferol-3-o-rutoside have better inhibitory effects compared to others. The results obtained suggest that the phenolic components extracted from ethyl acetate extracts of raspberry by molecularly imprinted polymers have the potential to inhibit the progression of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The red raspberry is one of the world's most popular berries. The main direction of its breeding has switched to nutritional quality, and the evaluation of raspberry germplasm for antioxidant content and activity is very important. As berries, raspberry leaves contain valuable bioactive compounds, but the optimal time for their collection is unknown. We evaluated 25 new breeding lines and standard raspberry cultivars for their polyphenolic content and antioxidant capacity. The antioxidant activity of berries correlated better with the content of total phenolics (0.88 and 0.92) and flavonoids (0.76 and 0.88) than with anthocyanins (0.37 and 0.66). Two breeding lines were significantly superior to the standard cultivars and can be used in further breeding. Leaves collected in three phenological phases of the raspberry contained more phenolics (5.4-fold) and flavonoids (4.1-fold) and showed higher antioxidant activities (2.4-fold in FRAP assay, 2.2-fold in ABTS) than berries. The optimal time for harvesting raspberry leaves is the fruit ripening stage, with exceptions for some cultivars. Genetic diversity analysis using microsatellite (SSR) markers from flavonoid biosynthesis genes divided the genotypes into five clusters, generally in agreement with their kinships. The relationship between genetic data based on metabolism-specific SSR markers and the chemical diversity of cultivars was first assessed. The biochemical and genetic results show a strong correlation (0.78). This study is useful for further the improvement of raspberry and other berry crops.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess and improve the oxidative stability of red raspberry seed oil\u2212RO, a potential topical ingredient derived from food industry by-products, on its own and when incorporated in low energy nanoemulsion (NE). The RO\u2019s oxidative stability was assessed at 5, 25, and 40 \u00b0C during one month of storage and expressed in: peroxide value, p-anisidine, and thiobarbituric reactive substances\u2014TBARS value, while for NEs, lipid hydroperoxides and TBARS values were monitored. Both synthetic (butylated hydroxytoluene\u2014BHT and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\u2014EDTA), and natural (oregano essential oil\u2014ORE and oak fruit extract\u2014OAK) antioxidants were used. Pure RO and RO with BHT or ORE were stable at 5 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C, but at 40 \u00b0C BHT showed only moderate protection, while ORE was prooxidant. NEs prepared with new biodegradable polyglycerol esters-based surfactants, with droplet sizes of < 50 nm and narrow size distribution, showed improved physicochemical stability at room temperature, and especially at 40 \u00b0C, compared to NEs with polysorbate 80, which required the addition of antioxidants to preserve their stability. Natural antioxidants ORE and OAK were compatible with all NEs; therefore, their use is proposed as an effective alternative to synthetic antioxidants.",

    "abstract": "Adiabatic temperature rise is an important method for determining isocyanate conversion in polyurethane foam reactions as well as many other exothermic chemical reactions. Adiabatic temperature rise can be used in conjunction with change in height and mass measurements to gain understanding into the blowing and gelling reactions that occur during polyurethane foaming as well as give important information on cell morphology. FoamPi is an open-source Raspberry Pi device for monitoring polyurethane foaming reactions. The device effectively monitors temperature rise, change in foam height as well as changes in the mass during the reaction. Three Python scripts are also presented. The first logs raw data during the reaction. The second corrects temperature data such that it can be used in adiabatic temperature rise reactions for calculating isocyanate conversion; additionally this script reduces noise in all the data and removes erroneous readings. The final script extracts important information from the corrected data such as maximum temperature change and maximum height change as well as the time to reach these points. Commercial examples of such equipment exist however the price (>\u00a310000) of these equipment make these systems inaccessible for many research laboratories. The FoamPi build presented is inexpensive (\u00a3350) and test examples are shown here to indicate the reproducibility of results as well as precision of the FoamPi.",

    "abstract": "In temperate climates, there has been an increasing interest by fruit growers to implement the use of high tunnels, using a variety of coverings, to extend the season for fruit production. High tunnels also provide an opportunity to enhance insect pest management, via physical exclusion, and thus support reductions in insecticide use. Due to increasing pest pressure by the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman, in Midwest U.S. raspberry, a 3-year study (2017\u22122019) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of selected high tunnel coverings to suppress adult beetle populations and minimize adult feeding injury. During each year of the study, P. japonica adult beetles were significantly reduced under poly-based coverings, with the ends open, and when a fine, nylon-mesh was used to cover the ends (p < 0.05). The poly-based covering also resulted in moderately higher ambient temperatures, which may have influenced beetle movement, including a \u201crepellency effect\u201d that encouraged beetles to exit the high tunnel structures. Although P. japonica adults are known to feed on raspberry flower clusters, including fruit, the majority (73\u221292%) of beetle feeding in this study was observed on the foliage. The impact of high tunnels on P. japonica are discussed within the context of developing sustainable Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs for raspberry production.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the implementation and testing of a modular software for multichannel control of Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). Moving towards an embedded scenario, the core of the system is a Raspberry Pi, whose different models (with different computing powers) best suit two different system use-cases: user-supervised and stand-alone. Given the need for real-time and reliable FES applications, software processing timings were analyzed for multiple configurations, along with hardware resources utilization. Among the results, the simultaneous use of eight channels has been functionally achieved (0% lost packets) while minimizing system timing failures (excessive processing latency). Further investigations included stressing the system using more constraining acquisition parameters, eventually limiting the usable channels (only for the stand-alone use-case).",

Nevertheless, most MOFs synthesized for the moment are faced with dimension/distribution issues and dissatisfactory electrical conductivity. Hence, in this paper, NiCo-MOF was successfully fabricated by applying a one-step solvothermal method, from which NiCo-MOF-3 presents an optimal electrochemical performance compared to other NiCo-MOFs and Ni/Co-MOF. Owing to its unique three-dimensional spherical raspberry structure, NiCo-MOF-3 demonstrates an available internal resistance and electron transfer resistance to ameliorate electrical energy storage, exhibiting an excellent mass specific capacitance of 639.8 F/g at 1 A/g. Then, a flexible quasi-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled with NiCo-MOF-3 as the positive electrode. The introduction of K",

A straightforward and versatile route was proposed for the large-scale synthesis of a monodisperse raspberry-like metal-organic framework (ZIF-8) using zinc nitrate as a zinc source and dimethylimidazole as an organic ligand in aqueous solution. After hydrophobic treatment with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane, the ethanolic suspension of three-dimensional raspberry-like ZIF-8 showed excellent superhydrophobic properties. Furthermore, commercial adhesives were used to blend with the suspension to improve the bonding strength to different substrates. These surfaces retained their water resistance after 50 finger-wipe cycles, 40 sandpaper abrasions and knife scratches. Moreover, the prepared hydrophobic surface can withstand the impact of water flow for 10 minutes. The formulations developed can be used for superhydrophobic coating applications on different substrate surfaces such as aluminum foil, glass, paper and cotton.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal acetylation modification is a common epigenetic change in tumorigenesis and is closely related to the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Our previous studies have suggested that black raspberry (BRB) anthocyanins have a significant chemopreventive effect against CRC. This study investigated whether protein acetylation plays an important role in BRB anthocyanins-mediated regulation of CRC progression.\nWe used the AOM-induced CRC mouse model and the CRC cell lines SW480 and Caco-2 to explore the potential role of acetylation of histone H4 and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway-related proteins (non-histone proteins) in the antitumor process mediated by BRB anthocyanins. The expression of related proteins was detected by western blot. ROS level was detected by immunofluorescence.\nBRB anthocyanins affected the acetylation level by down-regulating the expression of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and up-regulating the expression of MOF and EP300. The acetylation level of lysine sites on histone H4 (H4K5, H4K12 and H4K16) was increased. Furthermore, following BRB anthocyanins treatment, the expression of ac-p65 was significantly up-regulated and the NF-\u03baB signal pathway was activated, which in turn up-regulated Bax expression and inhibited Bcl-2, cyclin-D1, c-myc and NLRP3 expression to promote CRC cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and relieve inflammation.\nThe findings suggested that protein acetylation could play a critical role in BRB anthocyanins-regulated CRC development.",

    "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are one of the most diagnosed malignancies globally, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 40% to 50%. Current therapies are limited to highly invasive surgery, aggressive radiation, and chemotherapies. Recent reports have demonstrated the potential phytochemical properties of black raspberries in inhibiting the progression of various cancers including HNSCCs. However, the effects of black raspberry extracts on immune cells of the tumor microenvironment, specifically regulatory T cells during HNSCC, have not been investigated. We used a mouse model of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) chemically induced HNSCC carcinogenesis to determine these effects. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 4NQO for 16 weeks and regular water for 8 weeks. 4NQO-exposed mice were fed the AIN-76A control mouse diet or the AIN76 diet supplemented with black raspberry extract. At terminal sacrifice, tumor burdens and immune cell recruitment and activity were analyzed in the tumor microenvironment, draining lymph nodes, and spleens. Mice fed the BRB extract-supplemented diet displayed decreased tumor burden compared to mice provided the AIN-76A control diet. Black raspberry extract administration did not affect overall T-cell populations as well as Th1, Th2, or Th17 differentiation in spleens and tumor draining lymph nodes. However, dietary black raspberry extract administration inhibited regulatory T-cell recruitment to HNSCC tumor sites. This was associated with an increased cytotoxic immune response in the tumor microenvironment characterized by increased CD8",

    "abstract": "Dense stroma and an immunosuppressive microenvironment severely hamper the antitumor therapeutic results of pancreatic cancer. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) support the proliferation and invasion of tumor cells and contribute to the information of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). The repolarization of TAMs activates the antitumor immune response and sensitizes chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the difference in distributed mode between TAMs and tumor cells in tumor turns out to be an obstacle for dual targeting. To repolarize TAMs and elevate the chemoimmunotherapy outcome against pancreatic cancer, co-loading the TME responsive micellar system with gemcitabine (GEM) and PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (Wtmn) was used to dual target TAMs and tumor cells. GEM conjugated dendritic poly-lysine DGL (GD) nanoparticles were linked to polycaprolactone-polyethylene glycol micelles encapsulated with Wtmn (PP/Wtmn) ",

    "abstract": "Black and red raspberries are fruits with a high phenolic and vitamin C content but are highly susceptible to deterioration. The effect of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP 400\u2212600 MPa/CUT-10 min) and pulsed electric fields (PEF, frequency 100\u2212500 Hz, pulse number 100, electric field strength from 11.3 to 23.3 kV/cm, and specific energy from 19.7 to 168.4 kJ/L) processes on black/red raspberry juice was studied. The effect on the inactivation of microorganisms and pectin methylesterase (PME) activity, physicochemical parameters (pH, acidity, total soluble solids (\u00b0Brix), and water activity (aw)), vitamin C and phenolic compounds content were also determined. Results reveal that all HHP-treatments produced the highest (p < 0.05) log-reduction of molds (log 1.85 to 3.72), and yeast (log 3.19), in comparison with PEF-treatments. Increments in pH, acidity, and TSS values attributed to compounds\u2019 decompartmentalization were found. PME activity was partially inactivated by HHP-treatment at 600 MPa/10 min (22% of inactivation) and PEF-treatment at 200 Hz/168.4 kJ/L (19% of inactivation). Increment in vitamin C and TPC was also observed. The highest increment in TPC (79% of increment) and vitamin C (77% of increment) was observed with PEF at 200 Hz/168.4 kJ/L. The putative effect of HHP and PEF on microbial safety, enzyme inactivation, and phytochemical retention is also discussed in detail. In conclusion, HHP and PEF improve phytochemical compounds\u2019 content, microbial safety, and quality of black/red raspberry juice.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry-shaped particles have attracted increasing interest due to their tunable surface morphologies and physicochemical properties. A variety of covalent and noncovalent strategies have been developed for the fabrication of raspberry-shaped particles. However, most of these strategies are complex or require precise control of solution conditions. In this work, we develop a direct approach for the fabrication of noncovalent raspberry-shaped microgels. Our strategy works through the electrostatically driven heterocoagulation of binary microgels with complementary functional groups at the oil-water interface. By introducing hexanoic acid (HA) into the oil phase, stable inverse water-in-oil (w/o) Pickering emulsions could be stabilized solely by HA-swollen microgels or self-assembled raspberry-shaped microgels. Furthermore, the formation mechanism and the interfacial properties of interfaces laden with raspberry-shaped microgels were investigated. The results indicate that HA can effectively improve the hydrophobicity and interfacial activity of microgels. In addition, raspberry-shaped microgels achieve high coverage on the droplet surface, resulting in the elastic interface and excellent stability of emulsions. We envision that these results will not only fill a knowledge gap in the field of soft matter interfacial self-assembly, but also will shed light on the rational design of raspberry-shaped soft colloids and the on-demand control of interfacial rheology. In addition, we expect that our results will contribute to wider applications of microgel-stabilized emulsions, including cascade catalysis, microreactor, and in vivo drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "The Raspberry Pi is a credit card sized single board computer that finds its use in very diverse projects. Being a computer it runs on a full operating system and can be interfaced with a wide range of hardware. Its ability to collect and store data and its superior processing capabilities gives it an edge over other microprocessors. When used to collect data away from the grid, alternative methods of powering the Raspberry Pi have to be used. An ideal powering system should be autonomous, allowing the Raspberry Pi to be deployed indefinitely without the need to check on the system due to power shortcomings. In this paper we introduce the DSAIL Power Management Board that is used to power the Raspberry Pi autonomously. We have developed a prototype and used it to collect ecological data from a conservancy in Central Kenya.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify ellagitannins in black raspberry seeds (BRS) and to optimize accelerated solvent extraction of ellagitannins using an artificial neural network (ANN) coupled with genetic algorithm. Fifteen monomeric and dimeric ellagitannins were identified in BRS. For ANN modeling, extraction time, extraction temperature, and solvent concentration were set as input variables, and total ellagitannin content was set as output variable. The trained ANN had a mean squared error value of 0.0102 and a regression correlation coefficient of 0.9988. The predicted optimal extraction conditions for maximum total ellagitannin content were 63.7% acetone, 4.21\u00a0min, and 43.9\u00a0\u00b0C. The actual total ellagitannin content under the optimal extraction conditions was 13.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0\u00a0mg/g dry weight, and the prediction error was 0.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27%. This study is the first attempt to analyze the composition of ellagitannins in BRS and to determine optimal extraction conditions for maximum total ellagitannin content from BRS.",

    "abstract": "Ecological intensification has been proposed as an alternative paradigm for intensive agriculture to boost yield sustainably through utilizing ecosystem services. A prerequisite to achieving this is to understand the relations between multiple ecosystem services and production, while taking growth conditions such as nutrient availability into consideration. Here, we conducted a pot-field experiment to study the interactive effects of soil organic matter (SOM) content and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation on the production of raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) under four levels of fertilizer application. Raspberry flower number, fruit number and yield only significantly increased with fertilizer inputs but were not impacted by SOM content or AMF inoculation. Fruit set and single berry weight were influenced by both SOM content and AMF inoculation, in complex three-way interactions with fertilizer application. Fruit set of AMF inoculated plants increased with fertilizer inputs in low SOM soils, but decreased with fertilizer inputs under high SOM soils, with the highest fruit set occurring at no fertilizer inputs. In low SOM soils, the relation between single berry weight and fertilizer application was more pronounced in inoculated plants than in non-inoculated plants, while in high SOM soils the relative benefits of AMF inoculation on single berry weight decreased with increasing fertilizer inputs. We attribute the lack of effects of AMF inoculation and SOM content on flower number, fruit number and yield mainly to potential tradeoffs between the experimental variables that all influence resource uptake by plant root systems. Our results suggest that potentially beneficial effects of AMF and SOM can be offset by each other, probably driven by the dynamic relations between AMF and the host plants. The findings reveal fundamental implications for managing AMF inoculation and SOM management simultaneously in real-world agricultural systems.",

    "abstract": "Heterocrossa rubophaga (raspberry bud moth) feed on a range of Rubus species, including commercial berryfruit crops where they are a pest. This study aimed to characterize the responses of native and non-native Rubus species to feeding by raspberry bud moth larvae. In a laboratory environment, in situ headspace volatiles of three Rubus species were collected from healthy plants and those fed upon by raspberry bud moth. Rubus cissoides (bush lawyer), the native host of raspberry bud moth, gave a limited response to larval feeding with green leaf volatiles (GLVs) representing the only new headspace constituents of the infested plants. The non-native hosts, Rubus ursinus var. loganobaccus cv Boysenberry (Boysenberry), and Rubus fruticosus (blackberry), gave strong responses to raspberry bud moth herbivory, releasing a number of unique nitrogenous compounds in conjunction with the GLVs. The nitrogenous compounds were identified as 2-methylbutanenitrile, (Z)- and (E)- 2-methylbutanal O-methyloxime, benzyl nitrile, (Z)- and (E)- phenylacetaldehyde O-methyloxime and indole. The four methyloximes and 2-methylbutanenitrile were confirmed by synthesis. Field collected phenology data showed that raspberry bud moth were active year round on both bush lawyer and blackberry.",

This study, by using a chronic unpredictable mild stress- (CUMS-) induced depression model, thus investigated the effects and underlying mechanism of red raspberry extract (RRE) on depressive behavior, inflammation, and oxidative stress.\nDifferent treatments were given after random grouping of Sprague-Dawley rats, including no intervention (control), CUMS induction, and CUMS+different concentrations of RRE, and subsequently, depression-like behavior tests were performed. HE staining was designed to observe the pathological damage of the hippocampal tissue in rats. The levels of oxidative stress, endocrine hormones, and inflammatory factors were determined by biochemical assay and ELISA, and gene expression (mRNA and protein) in the hippocampal tissue by qRT-PCR and Western blot.\nOn completion of CUMS treatment, the rats showed severe depression-like behavior, with obvious hippocampal tissue damage, oxidative inflammatory response, and endocrine imbalance. Importantly, RRE treatment significantly improved such depression-like behavior and attenuated histopathological damage in CUMS rats when reducing inflammation and oxidative stress and endocrine imbalance with upregulation of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and interleukin- (IL-) 10 and downregulation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone (CORT), malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1\nBy regulating neuroinflammation, oxidative stress response, endocrine level, and BDNF/TrkB level, RRE showed potential efficacy in alleviating depression-like behavior and histopathological damage of hippocampal tissue in CUMS rats by regulating the GSK3",

    "abstract": "The Internet of things concept empowered by low-cost sensor technologies and headless computers has upscaled the applicability of vibration monitoring systems in recent years. Raspberry Shake devices are among those systems, constituting a crowdsourcing framework and forming a worldwide seismic network of over a thousand nodes. While Raspberry Shake devices have been proven to densify seismograph arrays efficiently, their potential for structural health monitoring (SHM) is still unknown and is open to discovery. This paper presents recent findings from existing buildings located in Bucharest (Romania) equipped with Raspberry Shake 4D (RS4D) devices, whose signal recorded under multiple seismic events has been analyzed using different modal identification algorithms. The obtained results show that RS4D modules can capture the building vibration behavior despite the short-duration and low-amplitude excitation sources. Based on 15 RS4D device readings from five different multistorey buildings, the results do not indicate damage in terms of modal frequency decay. The findings of this research propose a baseline for future seismic events that can track the changes in vibration characteristics as a consequence of future strong earthquakes. In summary, this research presents multi-device, multi-testbed, and multi-algorithm evidence on the feasibility of RS4D modules as SHM instruments, which are yet to be explored in earthquake engineering.",

    "abstract": "High-precision data acquisition (DAQ) is essential for developing new methods in the plant sciences. Commercial high-resolution DAQ systems are cost prohibitive, whereas the less expensive systems that are currently available lack the resolution and precision required for many physiological measurements.\nWe developed the software libraries, called piadcs, and hardware design for a DAQ system based on an ultra-high-resolution analog-to-digital converter and a Raspberry Pi computer. We tested the system precision with and without a thermocouple attached and found the precision with the sensor to be better than \u00b10.01\u00b0C and the maximum possible system resolution to be 0.4\u2009ppm.\nThe ultra-high-resolution DAQ system described here is inexpensive, flexible enough to be used with many different sensors, and can be built by researchers with rudimentary electronic and computer skills. This system is most applicable in the development of new measurement techniques and the improvement of existing methods.",

    "abstract": "A steadily increasing number of citizen seismological stations, often located in populated areas, record a plethora of man-made events. These events are especially of interest, when they are caused by criminal activity or man-made explosions. On 4 December 2021, during an attempted robbery of an automated teller machine (ATM) in Bonn-R\u00f6ttgen, Germany, the burglars used explosions. The seismic effects of the explosions were recorded with a Raspberry Shake (RS) station at a distance of 580\u00a0m from the site. While working on the analysis of this signal, another attack on an ATM on 23 February 2022 in K\u00fcrten-D\u00fcrscheid was recorded by another RS station, this time at 830-m distance with an instrument that also included an air pressure channel. The seismic signatures of both events indicate similar procedures in both cases whereby a larger explosion was quickly followed a smaller explosion after 21\u00a0s and 49\u00a0s, respectively. An estimate of the charge weight of the explosions shows that ratios of the strength of the first to second explosion were 21:1 and 9.4:1 in the R\u00f6ttgen and D\u00fcrscheid attacks, respectively.",

    "abstract": "A seismograph was designed based on Raspberry Pi. Although comprising 8 channels, the seismograph can be expanded to 16, 24, or 32 channels by using a USB interfacing with a microcontroller. In addition, by clustering more than one Raspberry Pi, the number of possible channels can be extended beyond 32. In this study, we also explored the computational intelligence of Raspberry Pi for running real-time systems and multithreaded algorithms to process raw seismic data. Also integrated into the seismograph is a Huawei MH5000-31 5G module, which provided high-speed internet real-time operations. Other hardware peripherals included a 24 bit ADS1251 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a STM32F407 microcontroller. Real-time data were acquired in the field for ambient noise tomography. An analysis tool called spatial autocorrelation (SPAC) was used to analyze the data, followed by inversion, which revealed the subsurface velocity of the site location. The proposed seismograph is prospective for small, medium, or commercial data acquisition. In accordance with the processing power and stability of Raspberry Pi, which were confirmed in this study, the proposed seismograph is also recommended as a template for developing high-performance computing applications, such as artificial intelligence (AI) in seismology and other related disciplines.",

    "abstract": "The use of rain shelters and reflective groundcovers has been shown to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of organic fruit crops prone to rain-driven epidemics of phytopathogens. Here, we tested whether these structures affect communities of epigean species. To this end, we studied rain shelters and white, synthetic reflective groundcovers placed in a red raspberry organic cropping system in New Brunswick, Canada, during two subsequent summers to assess their independent and combined effects on ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae). 18,445 ground beetles belonging to 54 species were collected. Rain shelters and reflective groundcovers altered patterns of ground beetle species richness, activity density and functional diversity compared to the control, but to a limited extent. Thus, this study suggests that these structures, which have known benefits against phytopathogens, have no detrimental impact on epigean fauna.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a global health problem and a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Exercise is an effective intervention to combat obesity. Fibronectin type III domain containing protein 5 (FNDC5)/irisin, a myokine, can stimulate the browning of white adipose tissue by increasing uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression, and therefore may represent a link between the beneficial effects of exercise and improvement in metabolic diseases. Thus, upregulating the endogenous expression of FNDC5/irisin by administering medication would be a good approach for treating obesity. Herein, we evaluated the efficacy of raspberry ketone (RK) in inducing FNDC5/irisin expression and the underlying mechanisms. The expression of brown fat-specific proteins (PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), CD137, and UCP1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), FNDC5, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1\u03b1) in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocyte was analyzed by western blotting or immunofluorescence. The level of irisin in the culture medium was also assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Results showed that RK (50 \u03bcM) significantly induced the upregulation of FNDC5 protein in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes; however, the irisin level in the culture media was unaffected. Moreover, RK significantly increased the levels of PGC1\u03b1, brown adipocyte markers (PRDM16, CD137, and UCP1), and HO-1. Furthermore, the upregulation of PGC1\u03b1 and FNDC5 and the browning effect induced by RK were significantly reduced by SnPP or FNDC5 siRNA, respectively. In conclusion, RK can induce FNDC5 protein expression via the HO-1 signaling pathway, and this study provides new evidence for the potential use of RK in the treatment of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Increased cardiac inflammation and oxidative stress are common features in obesity, and toll-like receptor (TLR)4 signaling is a key inflammatory pathway in this deleterious process. This study aimed to investigate whether berries could attenuate the detrimental effects of a high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet on the myocardium at the molecular level.\nEight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice consumed a low-fat, low-sucrose (LFLS) diet\u00a0alone or supplemented with 10% blackberry (BL), 10% raspberry (RB) or 10% blackberry\u00a0+\u00a0raspberry (BL\u00a0+\u00a0RB) for four weeks. Animals were then switched to a HFHS diet for 24 weeks with or without berry supplementation or maintained on a LFLS control diet without berry supplementation. Left ventricles of the heart were isolated for protein and mRNA analysis. Berry consumption, particularly BL\u00a0+\u00a0RB reduced NADPH-oxidase (NOX)1 and NOX2 and increased catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)2, expression while BL and RB supplementation alone was less efficacious. Downstream TLR4 signaling was attenuated mostly by both RB and BL\u00a0+\u00a0RB supplementation, while NF-\u03baB pathway was attenuated by BL\u00a0+\u00a0RB supplementation. Stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) was also attenuated by BL\u00a0+\u00a0RB supplementation, and reduced TNF-\u03b1 transcription and protein expression was observed only with BL\u00a0+\u00a0RB supplementation.\nThe synergistic effects of BL\u00a0+\u00a0RB may reduce obesity-induced cardiac inflammation and oxidative stress to a greater extent than BL or RB alone.",

    "abstract": "In nature, wetting by water droplets on superhydrophobic materials is governed by the Cassie-Baxter or Wenzel models. Moreover, sticky properties, derived from these types of wettings, are required for a wide range of applications involving superhydrophobic materials. As a facile new strategy, a method employing a gaseous fluorine precursor to fabricate core-shell particles, comprising perfectly shaped fluorine shells with adjustable adhesive strength, is described in this paper. Silica was used as the hydrophilic core, while polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was used for the hydrophobic shell coating, forming a raspberry-like shape. In addition, controlling the amount of PVDF coated on the silica surface enabled the water droplets to come into contact with both the PVDF of the shell and the silica of the core, thereby controlling both the superhydrophobicity and the adhesive strength. Thus, the synthesized particles formed a structured coating with controllable stickiness and contact angles of 131-165\u00b0. Furthermore, on surfaces with high adhesivity, the water droplets remained stable at tilt angles of 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 even under a strong centrifugal force, whereas on surfaces with low adhesivity, the water droplets slid off when the substrate was tilted at 4\u00b0.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this exploratory study was to evaluate the gut microbial signatures of distinct trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) responses following raspberry consumption. Investigations were carried out in 24 subjects at risk of developing metabolic syndrome who received 280 g/day of frozen raspberries for 8 weeks. Blood and stool samples were collected at weeks 0 and 8. Inter-individual variability in plasma TMAO levels was analyzed, 7 subjects were excluded due to noninformative signals and 17 subjects were kept for analysis and further stratified according to their TMAO response. Whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing analysis was used to determine the impact of raspberry consumption on gut microbial composition. Before the intervention, the relative abundance of Actinobacteriota was significantly higher in participants whose TMAO levels increased after the intervention (",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that the gut microbiota and cardiometabolic status are associated, suggesting dietary interventions that alter the microbiota may affect metabolic health.\nWe investigated whether supplementation with (poly)phenol-dense red raspberries (RRB), alone or with a fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) prebiotic, would improve biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk in individuals with prediabetes (PreDM) and insulin resistance (IR) and whether the effects are related to modulation of the gut microbiota.\nAdults with PreDM-IR (n\u00a0=\u00a026; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM age, 35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 years; fasting glucose, 5.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0mmol/L; HOMA-IR, 3.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3) or who were metabolically healthy (reference group; n\u00a0=\u00a010; age, 31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 years; fasting glucose, 5.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mmol/L; HOMA-IR, 1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1) participated in a randomized crossover trial with two 4-week supplementation periods, in which they consumed either RRB (125\u00a0g fresh equivalents) daily or RRB\u00a0+\u00a08g\u00a0FOS daily, separated by a 4-week washout. The primary outcome variable was the change in the gut microbiota composition, assessed by shotgun sequencing before (baseline) and at the end of each supplementation period. Secondary outcomes were changes in glucoregulation, lipid metabolism, anti-inflammatory status, and anthropometry. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03049631.\nIn PreDM-IR, RRB supplementation reduced hepatic-IR (-30.1%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.6%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and reduced plasma total and LDL cholesterol [-4.9%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and -7.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003), respectively] from baseline. Adding FOS (RRB\u00a0+\u00a0FOS) improved \u03b2-cell function [insulin secretion rate, +70.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a032.8% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02); Disposition Index, +94.4%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050.2% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04)], but had no significant effect on plasma cholesterol compared to baseline. RRB increased Eubacterium eligens (2-fold) and decreased Ruminococcus gnavus (-60%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034%), whereas RRB\u00a0+\u00a0FOS increased Bifidobacterium spp. (4-fold) and decreased Blautia wexlerae (-23%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012%) from baseline (all P values \u2264\u00a00.05). R. gnavus was positively correlated with hepatic-IR, and E. eligens and Bifidobacterium catenulatum were negatively correlated with cholesterol concentrations (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05).\nIncreased Bifidobacterium spp., concurrently with reduced R. gnavus, was associated with metabolic improvements in adults with PreDM-IR, warranting further research on the mechanisms involved in (poly)phenol/FOS-microbial interactions with host metabolism.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of a 48-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with pelvic/abdominal pain and a recent history of irregular periods. Pelvic ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis revealed a 7.3\u00a0cm adnexal mass with suspicious features. During the intraoperative evaluation, a frozen section slide and a cytological smear were prepared. The cytological preparation was moderately cellular, showing cohesive groups of atypical cells with anisonucleosis, high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, and oval nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The tumor cells surrounded extracellular, magenta hyaline globules, forming raspberry bodies. Raspberry bodies are comprised of basement membrane deposits and are a unique finding in ovarian clear cell carcinoma. Raspberry bodies were also found in the frozen section slide, but, in comparison to the cytological preparation, were rare, difficult to identify, and resembled necrotic debris. The intraoperative diagnosis of a clear cell carcinoma is important because the surgical management will be more aggressive, as optimal tumor debulking is shown to have better overall survival. In this manuscript, we detail the intraoperative evaluation of an ovarian mass, the utility of cytological preparation and importance of identifying raspberry bodies in the evaluation of ovarian masses, and surgical management of clear cell carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Industrial processing of raspberry juice and wine generates considerable byproducts of raspberry pomace. Ellagic acids/ellagitannins, being characterized by their antioxidant and antiproliferation properties, constitute the majority of polyphenolics in the pomace and are valuable for recovery. In the present study, we developed a novel procedure with sodium bicarbonate assisted extraction (SBAE) to recover ellagic acid from raspberry wine pomace. Key parameters in the procedure, i.e., sodium bicarbonate concentration, temperature, time and solid/liquid (S/L) ratio, were investigated by single factor analysis and optimized subsequently by Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Optimal parameters for the SBAE method here were found to be 1.2% (",

    "abstract": "U.S. black raspberry (BR) production is currently limited by narrowly adapted, elite germplasm. An improved understanding of genetic control and the stability of pomological traits will inform the development of improved BR germplasm and cultivars. To this end, the analysis of a multiple-environment trial of a BR mapping population derived from a cross that combines wild ancestors introgressed with commercial cultivars on both sides of its pedigree has provided insights into genetic variation, genotype-by-environment interactions, quantitative trait loci (QTL), and QTL-by-environment interactions (QEI) of fruit quality traits among diverse field environments. The genetic components and stability of four fruit size traits and six fruit biochemistry traits were characterized in this mapping population following their evaluation over three years at four distinct locations representative of current U.S. BR production. This revealed relatively stable genetic control of the four fruit size traits across the tested production environments and less stable genetic control of the fruit biochemistry traits. Of the fifteen total QTL, eleven exhibited significant QEI. Closely overlapping QTL revealed the linkage of several fruit size traits: fruit mass, drupelet count, and seed fraction. These and related findings are expected to guide further genetic characterization of BR fruit quality, management of breeding germplasm, and development of improved BR cultivars for U.S. production.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between sleep posture and sleep quality has been studied comprehensively. Over 70% of chronic diseases are highly correlated with sleep problems. However, sleep posture monitoring requires professional devices and trained nursing staff in a medical center. This paper proposes a contactless sleep-monitoring Internet of Things (IoT) system that is equipped with a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B; radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags are embedded in bed sheets as part of a low-cost and low-power microsystem. Random forest classification (RFC) is used to recognize sleep postures, which are then uploaded to the server database via Wi-Fi and displayed on a terminal. The experimental results obtained using RFC were compared to those obtained via the support vector machine (SVM) method and the multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm to validate the performance of the proposed system. The developed system can be also applied for sleep self-management at home and wireless sleep monitoring in medical wards.",

    "abstract": "Rubus idaeus L. (red raspberry), is a perennial woody plant species of the Rosaceae family that is widely cultivated in the temperate regions of world and is thus an economically important soft fruit species. It is prized for its flavour and aroma, as well as a high content of healthful compounds such as vitamins and antioxidants. Breeding programs exist globally for red raspberry, but variety development is a long and challenging process. Genomic and molecular tools for red raspberry are valuable resources for breeding. Here, a chromosome-length genome sequence assembly and related gene predictions for the red raspberry cultivar 'Anitra' are presented, comprising PacBio long read sequencing scaffolded using Hi-C sequence data. The assembled genome sequence totalled 291.7 Mbp, with 247.5 Mbp (84.8%) incorporated into seven sequencing scaffolds with an average length of 35.4 Mbp. A total of 39,448 protein-coding genes were predicted, 75% of which were functionally annotated. The seven chromosome scaffolds were anchored to a previously published genetic linkage map with a high degree of synteny and comparisons to genomes of closely related species within the Rosoideae revealed chromosome-scale rearrangements that have occurred over relatively short evolutionary periods. A chromosome-level genomic sequence of R. idaeus will be a valuable resource for the knowledge of its genome structure and function in red raspberry and will be a useful and important resource for researchers and plant breeders.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the norovirus (NoV) surrogate bacteriophage MS2 transfer from stainless steel, glass and low-density polypropylene surfaces to raspberry and pitanga fruits. The effect of sodium hypochlorite (100\u00a0ppm, 1\u00a0min) on MS2 survival on whole fruits, the MS2 survival in sanitized fruits and derived pulps during frozen storage, and in response to preservation technologies (heat, organic acids and salts) was also assessed. The highest (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) viral transfer (%) was observed from glass and stainless steel (\u223c90%) to raspberry, and from glass and polypropylene (\u223c75%) to pitanga, after 60\u00a0min of contact. Sodium hypochlorite reduced (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) MS2 titer by 3.5 and 3.8 log PFU/g in raspberry and pitanga, respectively. MS2 decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) up to 1.4 log PFU/g in frozen stored sanitized fruits (whole fruits and pulps) after 15 days, with no further changes after 30 days. Thermal treatments reduced MS2 titer (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in both fruit pulps. MS2 inactivation was higher in pitanga pulp. The addition of ascorbic acid, citric acid, sodium benzoate, or sodium metabisulfite had little effect (<1 log PFU/g) on MS2 concentration in either fruit. These results may inform NoV risk management practice in processing and handling of fruits.",

However, the synthesis and fluorescence properties of multilayer MOFs@MOFs are still worth improving. Herein, a fluorescent raspberry-shaped MOF@MOF was constructed via optimized seed-mediated synthesis by tuning the reaction time, reaction mode, and reaction concentration, involving the initial synthesis of the UiO-66-NH",

    "abstract": "The discovery of safe and effective plant polysaccharides with immunomodulatory effects has become a research hotspot. Raspberry is an essential commercial fruit and is widely distributed, cultivated, and consumed worldwide. In the present study, a homogeneous acidic polysaccharide (RPP-2a), with a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 55582 Da, was isolated from the pulp of raspberries through DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephadex G-200 chromatography. RPP-2a consisted of rhamnose, arabinose, galactose, glucose, xylose, galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid, with a molar ratio of 15.4:9.6:7.6:3.2:9.1:54.3:0.8. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS), 1D-, and 2D-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses suggested that the backbone of RPP-2a was primarily composed of \u21922)-",

The contribution of this study is that the implementation of the multi-thread in the pattern recognition improves the accuracy and decreases the computation time in the SoC. In this study, ten healthy volunteers were involved. The EMG signal was collected by using two dry electrodes placed on the wrist flexor and wrist extensor muscles. To reduce the complexity, four time-domain features were applied to extract the EMG signal. Furthermore, these features were used as the input of the machine learning.

    "abstract": "Defatted raspberry seeds were used as an alternative source of antioxidants and ellagic acid (EA) extracted using Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES). In the preliminary study, the best NADES combination (citric acid-betaine) and the most influential variables (temperature, time, and NADES/plant ratio) were selected for the further optimization process. All samples were analyzed in terms of total polyphenol, EA content, and antioxidant activity. Two sets of optimal conditions were generated by response surface methodology. The first set (Opt1) was designed for higher conversion of ellagitannins to EA while the latter set (Opt2) for higher EA content/100 g extract. Opt1 and Opt2 had higher values for all investigated responses compared to 80% ethanolic extract but had a lower conversion rate of ellagitannins to EA compared to acidified methanol extract. The third set of parameters (Opt3) selected beyond the initial experimental domain was used to obtain a sample with the highest EA content/100 g extract. Due to their nature, NADES extracts are ready to use and could have various technological roles in products since they are antioxidants, acidifiers, and colorants. NADES raspberry extracts exhibited higher anti-proliferative activity compared to ethanolic extracts in terms of EC",

    "abstract": "Raspberry leaf tea (RLT) is a traditional herb purported to help with many pregnancy-related outcomes including reducing the duration of labour. No experimental data exist to support these claims.\nThis study aims to determine how common use and knowledge of RLT are during pregnancy. It also aims to explore whether it would be possible to recruit women for a trial of raspberry leaf in the future.\nPostnatal women were asked to fill in a survey about their use of RLT during pregnancy, and their knowledge of its purported benefits. They were asked whether they would consider being part of a randomised controlled trial of raspberry leaf in the future.\nOne hundred and twenty-one women completed the survey. Of these, 88 (73%) were aware of herbal tea use in pregnancy and 46 (38%) reported using raspberry leaf during pregnancy. Of all women surveyed, 79% indicated they would be happy to participate in a trial of RLT in pregnancy if they were asked.\nDespite no scientific evidence of the efficacy of RLT in pregnancy, 38% of women surveyed used it during pregnancy. Further studies are required to determine whether the claims made about RLT are correct. Clinicians should base their advice on available evidence.",

    "abstract": "Although a raspberry-like configuration has been long observed in biological processes (e.g., the intimate association between Cajal bodies and B-snurposomes), studies on this morphology are very limited. Raspberry-like droplets created with multiple immiscible liquids are expected to provides an ideal model for such structures in biological systems, including their possible formation mechanism, phase behaviors, and coalescence dynamics.\nUsing three liquid phases, one surfactant and some colloidal particles, raspberry-like droplets containing one large central droplet and multiple protrusions embedded on its surface were successfully created. Confocal microscopy studies were carried out to track their formation and coalescence dynamics. A 2D phase-field model was applied to test the influence of the protrusions in the system.\nThe formation of this raspberry-like morphology involves a partial inversion process, which was predicted by Friberg et al. with numerical simulations but has never been demonstrated experimentally. A two-step coalescence was revealed, where the protrusions merge first and create a capillary bridge, which drives the droplets to coalesce. Increasing the viscosity of the continuous phase can help to prevent the destabilization. These fundamental features of raspberry-like droplets represent an important step toward producing multi-liquid materials with unique functionality, and can potentially illuminate some biological systems and processes.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, plant extracts are used as colorant and antioxidant in meat products. Therefore, the effects of cemen pastes produced using different concentrations (0%, 3%, 4% and 5%) of raspberry water extract (RWE) on past\u0131rma were investigated. RWE was tested to improve the color quality of past\u0131rma and decrease lipid and pigment oxidation during production and storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 150\u00a0days. Increasing RWE concentration in cemen paste reduced pH, TBARS (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and lactic acid bacteria counts (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) of past\u0131rma, while redness values (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increased compared to control sample without extract. The use of RWE contributed to improve sensory attributes of past\u0131rma, and the groups with 4% and 5% RWE had the highest sensory scores. Also, the color and oxidative stabilities of the past\u0131rma containing RWE were maintained better than control during storage period (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The overall results suggested that use of 4.0% or 5.0% RWE as a new additive in cemen paste can be considered an antioxidant and colorant for past\u0131rma processing to prevent color and lipid oxidation.",

    "abstract": "Low-cost analytical solutions built around microcomputers like the Raspberry Pi help to facilitate laboratory investigations in resource limited venues. Here, three camera modules (V1.3 with and without filter, as well as NoIR) that work with this microcomputer were assessed for their suitability in imaging fluorescent DNA following agarose gel electrophoresis. Evaluation of their utility was based on signal-to-noise (SNR) and noise variance metrics that were developed. Experiments conducted with samples were subjected to Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and the amplified products were separated using gel electrophoresis and stained with Midori green. Image analysis revealed the NoIR camera performed the best with SNR and noise variance values of 21.7 and 0.222 respectively. In experiments conducted using UV LED lighting to simulate ethidium bromide (EtBr) excitation, the NoIR and V1.3 with filter removed cameras showed comparable SNR values.",

    "abstract": "A 47-year-old man was referred to our hospital for detailed examination of a gastric polypoid lesion. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a raspberry-like polyp at the gastric body. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed this polypoid lesion to be a gastric adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic submucosal dissection was performed, and histopathological examination revealed that lesion to be a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the neoplasm was positive for MUC5AC and negative for MUC6, CD10, and pepsinogen I, indicating that this lesion was a foveolar-type gastric adenocarcinoma. From about 10 years now, this patient has been undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy almost every year. This lesion was absent until six years ago. Five years ago, a small polypoid lesion appeared at the gastric body, and this lesion gradually enlarged. The present case showed the growing process of the foveolar-type gastric adenocarcinoma with a raspberry-like appearance.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have reported that diets rich in phenolic compounds are beneficial to immune-metabolic health, yet these effects are heterogeneous and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To investigate the inter-individual variability of the immune-metabolic response to raspberry consumption, whole-blood RNAseq data from 24 participants receiving 280 g/d of raspberries for 8 weeks were used for the identification of responsiveness subgroups by using partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLSDA) and hierarchical clustering. Transcriptomic-based clustering regrouped participants into two distinct subgroups of 13 and 11 participants, so-called responders and non-responders, respectively. Following raspberry consumption, a significant decrease in triglycerides, cholesterol and C-reactive protein levels were found in responders, as compared to non-responders. Two major gene expression components of 100 and 220 genes were identified by sparse PLSDA as those better discriminating responders from non-responders, and functional analysis identified pathways related to cytokine production, leukocyte activation and immune response as significantly enriched with most discriminant genes. As compared to non-responders, the plasma lipidomic profile of responders was characterized by a significant decrease in triglycerides and an increase in phosphatidylcholines following raspberry consumption. Prior to the intervention, a distinct metagenomic profile was identified by PLSDA between responsiveness subgroups, and the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidota ratio was found significantly lower in responders, as compared to non-responders. Findings point to this transcriptomic-based clustering approach as a suitable tool to identify distinct responsiveness subgroups to raspberry consumption. This approach represents a promising framework to tackle the issue of inter-individual variability in the understanding of the impact of foods on immune-metabolic health.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical treatments can be simple and feasible methods for enhancing the anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic substrates. This work aims to relate the direct effect of five different mechanical treatments, i.e., variation in the size and number of particles, with the variations in the chemical composition and, subsequently, the effect over the anaerobic digestion of residual raspberry extrudate, which was used as a model substrate. A high variation in the number of particles and the particle size distribution was achieved depending on the mechanical treatment applied, reaching the highest number of particles for the treatments with knife mills and mortar (around 8000 particles per gram). The higher number of particles was related to higher solubilisation, including phenolic compounds and sugars. The combination of knife mills and mortar pretreatment, which presented the highest number of particles, resulted in a 66% more of polyphenols in comparison to the raw substrate. However, the presence of anthocyanins was higher in mechanical treatments with less effect. The enhancement of the anaerobic digestion was clearly related to the increment in the number of particles of small size after the mechanical treatments. The highest methane yield coefficient (236\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0mL CH",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to understand how the addition of pectin (2.5% and 5%) affected the content and bioaccessibility of phenolics in red raspberry puree. The results showed that the concentration of antioxidants in red raspberry puree was reduced with the addition of pectin. Similarly, addition of pectin to red raspberry puree significantly reduced the total phenolic content (15-20%), total antioxidant capacity (18-70%), and total monomeric anthocyanin (25-30%) after in vitro digestion. On the other hand, significant decreases in the bioaccessible amount of cyanidin (41%), cyanidin-3-glucoside (14%), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (17%), pelargonidin 3-glucoside (16%), and peonidin (28%) were observed after the addition of pectin (5% (w/w)) compared to the control (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) as analyzed with the HPLC method. According to the LC-MS/MS analysis of red raspberry samples, five flavonoids (rutin, quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and phlorizin) and six phenolic acids (gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, sinapic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid) were detected. The effect of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion varied depending on the type of the phenolic compounds. Sinapic acid and phlorizin were not detected at all in the intestinal phase, indicating that they were completely degraded during digestion. The percentage bioaccessibility of gallic acid (49-88%), rutin (6-16%), and quercetin (23-33%) was decreased proportionally with the increase in the pectin content in red raspberry purees (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). On the other hand, only 5% pectin addition to red raspberry puree resulted with a significant decrease in the amount of bioaccessible caffeic acid (8% to 5%), kaempferol (24% to 13%), ferulic acid (26% to 10%), and myricetin (91% to 57%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the modulation of gut microbiota by fermented raspberry juice (FRJ) both in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that total phenolic content and antioxidant activities of FRJ reached the highest after fermentation for 42 h. Seventeen phenolic compounds were contained in FRJ, mainly including ellagic acid (496.64 \u00b1 2.91 \u03bcg/g) and anthocyanins (total concentration: 387.93 \u03bcg/g). FRJ modulated the gut microbiota into a healthy in vitro status, with increase of valeric and isovaleric acids production. In healthy mice, all FRJ treatments improved the production of acetic, butyric and isovaleric acids as well as the gene expression of ZO-1, Claudin-1, Claudin-4, Ocdudin, E-cadherin and Muc-2. Moreover, variable gut microbial compositions were found among the groups fed diet-supplemented the different doses of FRJ, within low and median doses of FRJ may regulate the microbiota to a healthier state compared to the high dose supplementation. This study indicated that fermentation is a potential way to produce plant-based juices, which could reshape the gut microbiota and improve the host health.",

    "abstract": "Novel food and food compounds interventions have attracted a lot of attention nowadays for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases. Raspberry ketone (RK) is aromatic compound found within red fruits and berries, has been used as an over-the-counter product for weight loss.\u00a0However, actually, the effect of RK on weight loss is still controversial, and the mechanism is largely unknown. Besides, in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated the beneficial effect of RK on the development of other metabolic diseases. In this review, we comprehensively highlighted the synthesis, bioavailability, and metabolism of RK, and summarized the progress made in our understanding of the potential biological activities of RK, including antiobesity, antidiabetes, cardioprotection, and hepatoprotection, as well as their underlying mechanisms. This paper provides a critical overview about the current findings and proposes the future studies in the area of RK on human health. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Raspberry ketone (RK) has been used for weight control for years, but this effect is controversial considering food intake. Additionally, RK is beneficial for T2DM, liver and heart injury. The underlying mechanisms of the protective effect of RK including accelerating fatty acid oxidation, balancing serum glucose level, anti-inflammation, antioxidant process, and so on. In this context, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the benefits of RK against many metabolic diseases and discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms. We hope our work will be helpful for further researches on RK and improve its public recognition.",

The availability of neuroimaging ca-pacities in remote communities can alleviate this scenario supporting neurorehabilitation programs in remote settings. This research aims at building a multimodal EEG-fNIRS neuroimaging platform deployable to rural communities to support neurorehabilitation efforts. A Raspberry Pi 4 is chosen as the CPU for the platform responsible for presenting the neurorehabilitation stimuli, acquiring, processing and storing concurrent neuroimaging records as well as the proper synchronization between the neuroimaging streams. We present here two experiments to assess the feasibility and characterization of the Raspberry Pi as the core for a multimodal EEG-fNIRS neuroimaging platform; one over controlled conditions using a combination of synthetic and real data, and another from a full test during resting state. CPU usage, RAM usage and operation temperature were measured during the tests with mean operational records below 40% for CPU cores, 13.6% for memory and 58.85 \u00b0 C for temperatures. Package loss was inexistent on synthetic data and negligible on experimental data. Current consumption can be satisfied with a 1000 mAh 5V battery. The Raspberry Pi 4 was able to cope with the required workload in conditions of operation similar to those needed to support a neurorehabilitation evaluation.",

    "abstract": "A lab-on-a-tube biosensor was established to rapidly, sensitively and automatically detect foodborne bacteria through a rotatable Halbach magnet to form and rotate magnetic nanobead (MNB) chains for specific isolation of target bacteria, gold@platinum nanocatalysts (Au@PtNCs) to label target bacteria for efficient amplification of detection signal and Raspberry Pi App to collect and analyze the image of catalysate. First, the glass tube was successively preloaded with the mixture of MNBs, sample and Au@PtNCs, the washing buffer (skim milk) and the substrate (hydrogen peroxide-3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine), and they were separated by air gaps. After the tube was placed on the biosensor, the MNB chains were stably formed and continuously rotated using the Halbach magnet and the mixture was moved back and forth using a programmable peristaltic pump, thus making the formation of MNB-bacteria-Au@PtNCs complexes. After the washing buffer was moved to wash the complexes, the substrate was then moved to resuspend the complexes, resulting in the catalytic reaction that changed the color of the substrate. Finally, the catalysate was moved to the designated area, the image of which was analyzed by the Raspberry Pi App to quantitatively determine the concentration of bacteria in the samples. This biosensor was able to detect Salmonella in spiked chicken samples in 1\u00a0h with lower detection limit of 8\u00a0CFU/50\u00a0\u03bcL and a recovery from 88.96% to 99.74%. This biosensor based on a single tube is very promising to automatically detect foodborne bacteria due to its low cost, high integration and simple operation.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports suggest that glucocorticoids (GCs), which can be synthesized in the oral mucosa, play an important role in cancer development. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to characterize the role of the oral GC system in oral cancer, and determine the effect of black raspberry (BRB) administration on GC modulation during oral cancer chemoprevention. We determined the expression of GC enzymes in various oral cancer cell lines, and investigated the role of the GC inactivating enzyme HSD11B2 on CAL27 oral cancer cells using siRNA mediated knockdown approaches. Using two in vivo models of oral carcinogenesis with 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide carcinogen on C57Bl/6 mice and F344 rats, we determined the effect of BRB on GC modulation during head and neck squamous cell carcinoma chemoprevention. Our results demonstrate that HSD11B2, which inactivates cortisol to cortisone, is downregulated during oral carcinogenesis in clinical and experimental models. Knockdown of HSD11B2 in oral cancer cells promotes cellular proliferation, invasion and expression of angiogenic biomarkers EGFR and VEGFA. An ethanol extract of BRB increased HSD11B2 expression on oral cancer cells. Dietary administration of 5% BRB increased Hsd11b2 gene and protein expression and reduced the active GC, corticosterone, in cancer-induced mouse tongues. Our results demonstrate that the oral GC system is modulated during oral carcinogenesis, and BRB administration upregulates Hsd11b2 during oral cancer chemoprevention. In conclusion, our findings challenge the use of synthetic GCs in head and neck cancer, and support the use of natural product alternatives that potentially modulate GC metabolism in a manner that supports oral cancer chemoprevention.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone [4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone] is a natural aromatic compound found in raspberries and other fruits. Raspberry ketone (RK) is synthetically produced for use as a commercial flavoring agent. In the United States and other markets, it is sold as a dietary supplement for weight control. The potential of RK to reduce or prevent excessive weight gain is unclear and could be a convergence of several different actions. This study sought to determine whether acute RK can immediately delay carbohydrate hyperglycemia and reduce gastrointestinal emptying. In addition, we explored the metabolic signature of chronic RK to prevent or remedy the metabolic effects of diet-induced weight gain. In high-fat diet (HFD; 45% fat)-fed male mice, acute oral gavage of RK (200 mg/kg) reduced hyperglycemia from oral sucrose load (4 g/kg) at 15 min. In HFD-fed female mice, acute oral RK resulted in an increase in blood glucose at 30 min. Chronic daily oral gavage of RK (200 mg/kg) commencing with HFD access (HFD_RK) for 11 weeks resulted in less body weight gain and reduced fat mass compared with vehicle treated (HFD_Veh) and chronic RK starting 4 weeks after HFD access (HFD_RKw4) groups. Compared with a control group fed a low-fat diet (LFD; 10% fat) and dosed with vehicle (LFD_Veh), glucose AUC of an oral glucose tolerance test was increased with HFD_Veh, but not in HFD_RK or HFD_RKw4.

    "abstract": "Human gut microbiota is critical for human health, as their dysbiosis could lead to various diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome and obesity. Black raspberry (BRB) has been increasingly studied recently for its impact on gut microbiota as a rich source of phytochemicals (e.g., anthocyanin). To investigate the effect of BRB extract on the gut microbiota composition and their metabolism, an in-vitro human colonic model (HCM) was utilized to study the direct interaction between BRB and gut microbiome. Conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, anaerobic environment) in HCM were closely monitored and maintained to simulate the human intestinal system. Fresh fecal samples donated by three young healthy volunteers were used for gut microbiota inoculation in the HCM. 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing and liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) based metabolomics were performed to study the impact of BRB on gut microbiota characteristics and their metabolism (fatty acids, polar metabolites, and phenolic compounds). Our data suggested that BRB intervention modulated gut microbiota at the genus level in different HCM sections mimicing ascending, transverse, and descending colons. Relative abundance of Enterococcus was commonly decreased in all colon sections, while modulations of other bacteria genera were mostly location-dependent. Meanwhile, significant changes in the metabolic profile of gut microbiota related to fatty acids, endogenous polar metabolites, and phenolic compounds were detected, in which arginine and proline metabolism, lysine degradation, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis were mostly regulated. Moreover, we identified several significant associations between altered microbial populations and changes in microbial metabolites. In summary, our study revealed the impact of BRB intervention on gut microbiota composition and metabolism change, which may exert physiological change to host metabolism and host health.",

    "abstract": "Mechanically robust superhydrophobic coatings have been extensively reported using chemically susceptible inorganic fillers like slica, titanium dioxide, and zinc oxide for constructing micro-nano structures. Organic particles are good candidates for improving chemical resistance, whereas the synthesis of organic particles with well-defined and stable micro-nano structures remains exclusive. Here, an all-organic, cross-linked superhydrophobic coating comprising raspberry-like fluorinated micro particles (RLFMP) and fluorinated polyurethane (FPU) is prepared via thiol-click reaction. Benefiting from the robust micro-nano structure of RLFMP and the excellent flexibility of FPU, the coating can maintain superhydrophobicity after severe alkali corrosion or mechanical damage, while the superhydrophobicity can be repaired readily by the fast recovery of micro-nano roughness and migration of branched fluoroalkyl chains to the coating surface. This design strategy is expected to provide a good application of thiol-click chemistry.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered one of the most serious public health problems affecting liver. The reported beneficial impact of raspberries on obesity and associated metabolic disorder makes it a suitable candidate against NAFLD. In the current study, the chemical profile of raspberry seed oil (RO) was characterized by analysis of fatty acid and tocopherol contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in addition to the determination of total phenolic and flavonoids. High levels of unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid (49.9%), \u03b1-linolenic acid (25.98%), and oleic acid (17.6%), along with high total tocopherol content (184\u00a0mg/100\u00a0gm) were detected in oil. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents in RO were estimated to be 22.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25\u00a0mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100\u00a0mg oil and 1.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15\u00a0mg\u00a0quercetin (QU)/100\u00a0mg, respectively. Anti-NAFLD efficacy of RO at different doses (0.4 and 0.8\u00a0mL) in a model of a high-fat diet (HFD) fed rats was assessed by estimating lipid profile, liver enzyme activity, glucose and insulin levels as well as adipokines and inflammatory marker. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), which is a molecular target for NAFLD was also tested. Liver histopathology was carried out and its homogenate was used to estimate oxidative stress markers. Consumption of RO significantly improved lipid parameters and hepatic enzyme activities, reduced insulin resistance and glucose levels, significantly ameliorated inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. Furthermore, RO treatment significantly modulated adipokines activities and elevated PPAR\u03b3 levels. Raspberry seed oil administration significantly improved these HFD induced histopathological alterations. Moreover, a molecular docking study was performed on the identified fatty acids and tocopherols. Among the identified compounds, oleic acid, \u03b1-linolenic acid and \u03b3-tocopherol exhibited the highest docking score as PPAR\u03b3 activator posing them as a potential anti-NAFLD drug leads. Study findings suggest RO as an effective therapeutic candidate for ameliorating NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry snack, as a novel berry product, has rich favor and high crisp taste, where controllable texture quality is conducive to the palatability of the snack. Determinative factors of microwave puffing in microwave intensity and duration and key property of material in Young's modulus were introduced to investigate the formation of texture quality of berry snack under microwave puffing. The results indicate that the microwave intensity has negative correlation with Young's modulus of raspberry chips, which causes the more porosity inside under microwave puffing. Reasonable Young's modulus of raspberry chips enhances the interior porosity and exterior expansion volume of raspberry snack due to the water vapor wrapped other than escaped. The greater microwave intensity results in the higher volume expansion of raspberry chips, in which the great volume expansion from porous pores structure confers moderate hardness. In microwave puffing, the formation of hardness and crispness of raspberry snack depend on microwave puffing parameters, leading to high temperature and great dehydration rate in quick puffing duration, in addition to Young's modulus of raspberry chips, where high dehydration rate accelerates water removal inside raspberry chips to form a harder texture with decreasing springiness, whereas low dehydration rate leads to the gentle change of springiness. Raspberry snack with uniform internal pores and regular shape forming desirable texture may be achieved under the microwave intensity of 7.5 W/g and the puffing duration of 6 min. This study indicates that high-quality raspberry snack may be achieved via controlling heating rate in microwave puffing.",

    "abstract": "One of the major risk factors for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is tobacco smoke exposure, but the mechanisms that can account for disease development remain to be fully defined. Utilizing our HNSCC mouse model, we analyzed oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) induced by the active metabolite of a common smoke constituent, dibenzo[a,l]pyrene diol-epoxide (DBPDE). Analyzing protein expression by either immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry, we identified biologic processes that are dysregulated in premalignant and invasive cancer lesions induced by DBPDE. Interestingly, p120ctn expression is downregulated in both stages of the disease. In addition to decreased p120ctn expression, there was also increased proliferation (as measured by Ki67), inflammation (as measured by NFkB (p65) expression), neovascularization (as measured by CD31) and recruitment of Ly6G-positive immune cells as well as strong EGFR expression. We also examined the effect of the chemopreventive agent black raspberry (BRB) on p120ctn and EGFR protein expression in DBPDE treated mice. p120ctn, but not EGFR, protein expression increased in mice treated with BRB. Our results suggest that modulation of p120ctn may, in part, account for the mechanism by which BRB inhibits DBPDE induced OSCC in mice.",

    "abstract": "Bespoke (custom-built) Raspberry Pi cameras are increasingly popular research tools in the fields of behavioral ecology and conservation, because of their comparative flexibility in programmable settings, ability to be paired with other sensors, and because they are typically cheaper than commercially built models.Here, we describe a novel, Raspberry Pi-based camera system that is fully portable and yet weatherproof-especially to humidity and salt spray. The camera was paired with a passive infrared sensor, to create a movement-triggered camera capable of recording videos over a 24-hr period. We describe an example deployment involving \"retro-fitting\" these cameras into artificial nest boxes on Praia Islet, Azores archipelago, Portugal, to monitor the behaviors and interspecific interactions of two sympatric species of storm-petrel (Monteiro's storm-petrel ",

    "abstract": "An understanding of cellular mechanoresponses to well-defined synthetic topographic features is crucial for the fundamental research and biomedical applications of stem cells. Structured biointerfaces, in particular the ones with nanometer and/or micrometer surficial features, have drawn more attention in the past few decades. However, it is still difficult to integrate nanostructures and microstructures onto the synthesized biointerfaces to mimic the hierarchical architecture of the native extracellular matrix (ECM). Herein, a series of \"raspberry\"-like hierarchical surfaces with well-defined nanofeatures and tunable nano/microfeatures have been achieved via a catecholic polymer coating technique. Cellular responses to these hierarchical interfaces were systemically studied, indicating that the nanofeatures on the raspberry surfaces significantly enhanced the mechanosensing of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to interfacial physical cues. Cell mechanotransduction was further investigated by analyzing focal adhesion assembling, cytoskeleton organization, cell nuclear mechanics, and transcriptional activity. The results suggest that nanosize surficial features could increase cellular mechanosensing to environment physical cues. The mechanotransduction and cell fate specification were greatly enhanced by the ECM mimicking nano/microhierarchical biointerfaces but the features should be in an optimized size.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry is a source of dietary fibre and phenolic compounds, which are metabolised by the gut microbiota, resulting in the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and phenolic catabolites; but the formation of these compounds depends on the microbiota composition. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the raspberry and its fractions (phenolic extract, total and insoluble dietary fibre) affect the microbial activity depending on the body weight condition. For this, in vitro fermentations of raspberry fractions were carried out using faeces from normal-weight (NW) and overweight volunteers (OW) during 48\u00a0h, and phenolic catabolites and SCFAs were analysed at 0, 6, 24 and 48\u00a0h. The whole raspberry and the phenolic extract produced greater quantities of urolithins and total SCFAs when compared with fibre fractions, reaching the highest amount between 24 and 48\u00a0h. The body weight condition was an important factor, since faeces from NW led to greater production of urolithins from non-extractable phenolic compounds bound to fibre fractions, whereas in OW the urolithins production was higher from the fractions with more extractable polyphenols. In summary, the whole raspberry has been shown to have a prebiotic effect, mainly due to its phenolic compounds content rather than its fibre content.",

    "abstract": "This work focuses on developing light environments for the effective regulation of morphogenesis and ex vitro conditions adaptation in micropropagated raspberry plants on the basis of photomorphogenetic control of physiological processes using light-emitting diodes (LEDs). In experiments with cloned plants growing ex vitro in stressful conditions during acclimation, the effects of optical radiation of various spectral combinations from different photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) spectral regions were studied. The data on the plant development and state of the photosynthetic apparatus, features of photosynthetic gas exchange and transpiration, accumulation of photosynthetic pigments, light curves of photosynthesis, and data on growth processes in light modes using combined quasimonochromatic radiation (either mixture of red, green, and blue light or red, far-red, and blue light) with various ratio of the distinct spectral regions were obtained. Photosynthetic apparatus functional activity under different light conditions was studied with chlorophyll fluorescence determination, and plant stress responses to growing under artificial spectral light conditions were characterized. The experiments were accompanied by detailed plant phenotyping at the structural and functional levels. Plant acclimation and photosynthetic improvements in response to added far-red and green light wavelengths to the main red-blue spectrum have been elucidated.",

    "abstract": "The retrospective analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals acquired from patients under general anesthesia is crucial in understanding the patient's unconscious brain's state. However, the creation of such database is often tedious and cumbersome and involves human labor. Hence, we developed a Raspberry Pi-based system for archiving EEG signals recorded from patients under anesthesia in operating rooms (ORs) with minimal human involvement.\nUsing this system, we archived patient EEG signals from over 500 unique surgeries at the Emory University Orthopaedics and Spine Hospital, Atlanta, for about 18 months. For this, we developed a software package that runs on a Raspberry Pi and archives patient EEG signals from a SedLine Root EEG Monitor (Masimo) to a secure Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant cloud storage. The OR number corresponding to each surgery was archived along with the EEG signal to facilitate retrospective EEG analysis. We retrospectively processed the archived EEG signals and performed signal quality checks. We also proposed a formula to compute the proportion of true EEG signal and calculated the corresponding statistics. Further, we curated and interleaved patient medical record information with the corresponding EEG signals.\nWe retrospectively processed the EEG signals to demonstrate a statistically significant negative correlation between the relative alpha power (8-12 Hz) of the EEG signal captured under anesthesia and the patient's age.\nOur system is a standalone EEG archiver developed using low cost and readily available hardware. We demonstrated that one could create a large-scale EEG database with minimal human involvement. Moreover, we showed that the captured EEG signal is of good quality for retrospective analysis and combined the EEG signal with the patient medical records. This project's software has been released under an open-source license to enable others to use and contribute.",

    "abstract": "Correlated localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR), surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and localized electromagnetic (EM) field distributions of pure and modified gold (Au) nanoassemblies have been demonstrated. The Au nanoassemblies were decorated as half-raspberry-like nanostructures by silver (Ag) mists, and the characteristics of their SPR and SERS were observed at the same spatial position with and without decoration. The decoration of Au nanoassemblies was analyzed in-depth and confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Multifunctional and lab-built microscopy was used to capture correlated SPR and SERS imaging and spectral measurements. Without decoration, strong SPR peaks and enhanced SERS signals were observed, whereas intense plasmon excitation deteriorated with a broadening and diminishing peak and the SERS enhancement dropped at least by 10 fold upon the modification. Preferential enhancement near the edge was observed in the correlated SPR and SERS measurements. The variations in localized SPR, subsequent SERS enhancement, and preferential confinement were speculated concerning localized EM near-field deformation. A typical tetramer with five interstitials was modeled and simulated by finite difference time domain (FDTD) analysis at different incident polarizations. The EM near-field distributions were extracted with and without decoration of constituent interstitials by Ag mists. Without the modification of participating interstitials, the EM near-field distributions were found confined, whereas additional EM near-field confinements were observed in the presence of Ag mists. Such EM near-field deformations due to the modification of constituent interstitials were supposed to broaden and deteriorate SPR characteristics of Au nanoassemblies as observed under this investigation.",

    "abstract": "Edge Computing enables to perform measurement and cognitive decisions outside a central server by performing data storage, manipulation, and processing on the Internet of Things (IoT) node. Also, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning applications have become a rudimentary procedure in virtually every industrial or preliminary system. Consequently, the Raspberry Pi is adopted, which is a low-cost computing platform that is profitably applied in the field of IoT. As for the software part, among the plethora of Machine Learning (ML) paradigms reported in the literature, we identified Rulex, as a good ML platform, suitable to be implemented on the Raspberry Pi. In this paper, we present the porting of the Rulex ML platform on the board to perform ML forecasts in an IoT setup. Specifically, we explain the porting Rulex's libraries on Windows 32 Bits, Ubuntu 64 Bits, and Raspbian 32 Bits. Therefore, with the aim of carrying out an in-depth verification of the application possibilities, we propose to perform forecasts on five unrelated datasets from five different applications, having varying sizes in terms of the number of records, skewness, and dimensionality. These include a small Urban Classification dataset, three larger datasets concerning Human Activity detection, a Biomedical dataset related to mental state, and a Vehicle Activity Recognition dataset. The overall accuracies for the forecasts performed are: 84.13%, 99.29% (for SVM), 95.47% (for SVM), and 95.27% (For KNN) respectively. Finally, an image-based gender classification dataset is employed to perform image classification on the Edge. Moreover, a novel image pre-processing Algorithm was developed that converts images into Time-series by relying on statistical contour-based detection techniques. Even though the dataset contains inconsistent and random images, in terms of subjects and settings, Rulex achieves an overall accuracy of 96.47% while competing with the literature which is dominated by forward-facing and mugshot images. Additionally, power consumption for the Raspberry Pi in a Client/Server setup was compared with an HP laptop, where the board takes more time, but consumes less energy for the same ML task.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic fibrosis is a wound-healing process caused by prolonged liver damage and often occurs due to hepatic stellate cell activation in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Red raspberry has been found to attenuate oxidative stress, mainly because it is rich in bioactive components. In the current study, we investigated the inhibitory effects and associated molecular mechanisms of red raspberry extract (RBE) upon activated hepatic stellate cell (aHSC) in cellular and rat models. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were increased in the dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-applied samples, whereas treatment of RBE significantly suppressed the activities of these enzymes. In addition, a histopathological analysis demonstrated that RBE could substantially diminish the hepatic collagen content and alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression induced by DMN. Administration of 250\u00a0\u03bcg/mL RBE could also arrest the growth and enhance the apoptosis of activated HSC-T6 cells, which was accompanied with elevated levels of activated caspases and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Particularly, RBE application remarkably abolished oxidative damage within the cells and reduced the carbonylation of proteins, which was attributed to the upregulation of catalase, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Moreover, the knockdown of Nrf2 together with the RBE treatment synergistically abrogated the expression of \u03b1-SMA and promoted the level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3), suggesting that RBE could mitigate the transdifferentiation of HSC in a Nrf2-independent manner. These findings implied that the application of RBE could effectively remove oxidative stress and relieve the activation of HSC via modulating the caspase/PARP, Nrf2/HO-1 and PPAR-\u03b3 pathways, which may allow the development of novel therapeutic strategies against chemical-caused liver fibrogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry anthocyanins were isolated and purified by XAD-7HP macroporous resin and silica gel column chromatography. Anthocyanins were then acylated with methyl salicylate as catalyzed by lipase under reduced pressure, and the conversion rate was 84.26%. LC-MS and NMR were used to identify the structure, and the stability, antioxidant capacity and protective ability of the acylated anthocyanins against oxidative damage were determined. The results showed that cyanindin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) was the primary anthocyanin in raspberry, and the binding site of acylation was on the glucoside C-6, and the product was cyanidin-3-(6-salicyloyl) glucoside (C3-6(S) G). After acylation, its stability in light, heat and oxidation environments could be significantly improved, and acylated ACN showed insignificant changes in antioxidant capacities to scavenge DPPH and ABTS free radicals, as well as oxygen free radical absorptive capacity (ORAC). And it could also effectively prevent the release of ROS caused by oxidative damage and alleviate oxidative stress damage.",

In this work, we reported a high-throughput sample preparation method for RK and 25 related phenolic compounds in white adipose tissues using an improved micro-scale QuEChERS (quick, efficient, cheap, easy, rugged and safe) approach with enhanced matrix removal (EMR)-lipid cleanup in 96-well plates, followed by UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS analysis. The absolute recovery was 73-105% at the extraction step, and achieved 71-96% at the EMR cleanup step. The EMR cleanup removed around 66% of total lipids in the acetonitrile extract as profiled by UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. The innovative introduction of a reversed-phase C18 sorbent into the extract significantly improved the analytes' recovery during SpeedVac drying. The final accuracy achieved 80-120% for most analytes. Overall, this newly developed and validated method could serve as a powerful tool for analyzing RK and related phenolic compounds in fatty tissues.",

    "abstract": "A continuous high-fat/high-fructose diet induces inflammation and lowers vascular endothelial function in the body. This research examined the effects of black raspberry (BR) powder consumption on the inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction in rats fed with a high-fat diet and fructose solution. Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups as control (AIN-93G diet + distilled water) and HFF (high-fat diet + 20% fructose solution) groups, for 16\u00a0weeks. At 8\u00a0weeks, the HFF was further divided into three subgroups: HFF, HFFBR2.5 (2.5% BR in high-fat diet), and HFFBR5 (5% BR in high-fat diet). The BR-fed groups showed significantly higher high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and lower triglycerides than the HFF group. Rats supplemented with BR showed decreased mRNA and protein expressions of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules in the liver and aorta tissues. Furthermore, the aortic protein expression of endothelial nitroxide synthase was significantly greater in the HFFBR2.5 and HFFBR5 than HFF. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Black raspberry (BR: Rubus occidentalis) is abundant in flavonoids and anthocyanins. BR displays various biological activities and has been used to alleviate inflammatory conditions. In our study, BR supplementation showed promising effects against high-fat/high-fructose diet-induced inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in rats by decreasing markers of inflammation and improving vascular endothelial function. These findings suggest that BR consumption could have beneficial effects on the risk factors of cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "In the paper, an attempt was made to use methods of artificial neural networks (ANN) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to identify raspberry powders that are different from each other in terms of the amount and the type of polysaccharide. Spectra in the absorbance function (FTIR) were prepared as well as training sets, taking into account the structure of microparticles acquired from microscopic images with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In addition to the above, Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks (MLPNs) with a set of texture descriptors (machine learning) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with bitmap (deep learning) were devised, which is an innovative attitude to solving this issue. The aim of the paper was to create MLPN and CNN neural models, which are characterized by a high efficiency of classification. It translates into recognizing microparticles (obtaining their homogeneity) of raspberry powders on the basis of the texture of the image pixel.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic condition characterized by glucose clearance abnormalities and insufficient insulin response. Left uncontrolled, T2DM can result in serious complications and death. With no cure available currently and the prevalence of major risk factors such as pre-diabetes and the metabolic syndrome continuously increasing, there is an urgent need for effective treatments with limited or no side effects. Red raspberries (RR) contain various phytonutrients with potential for modulating insulin function, glucose, and lipid metabolism. The objective of this literature review was to investigate the potential metabolic benefits of dietary RR in individuals with T2DM and pre-diabetes. A search of major scientific databases was employed to identify peer-reviewed, in vivo, or human studies that utilized whole RR or its functional constituents as treatment. The studies examined provide evidence that RR may offer clinically beneficial effects for the prevention and management of chronic diseases through improvements in glucose handling and insulin sensitivity, adiposity, lipid profiles, ectopic lipid accumulation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cardiac health. More human trials and in vivo studies are needed to confirm the benefits of dietary RR in T2DM and pre-diabetes and to explore the dose-dependent relationships, optimal duration, and treatment modality.",

    "abstract": "Rubus chingii, is widely distributed in many Asian countries and well known for its medicinal and dietary properties. Diversity of fruit color in raspberry has been attributed to the presence of either anthocyanins or carotenoids. In this study, we investigated anthocyanins and carotenoids, and their biosynthesis by LC-MS/MS. Six anthocyanins mainly consisted of flavanol-anthocyanins while five carotenoids mainly consisted of \u03b2-citraurin esters. Flavanol-anthocyanins were produced from an offshoot of the anthocyanin biosynthesis, which started with biosynthesis of flavanols and anthocyanidin by leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR)/anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS/LDOX) respectively. \u03b2-citraurin esters were produced from cleavage of zeaxanthin and esterification by organic acid, which was an offshoot of the carotenoid biosynthesis. The offshoot started with biosynthesis of zeaxanthin and \u03b2-citraurin by carotene \u03b2-hydroxylase (CHYB/LUT5) and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) respectively. During fruit ripening, biosynthesis of flavanols and anthocyanins was down-regulated by genes/proteins involved in phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, while biosynthesis of \u03b2-citraurin esters was up-regulated by imbalanced expression of genes/proteins involved in \u03b2,\u03b2-ring and \u03b2, \u03b5-ring hydroxylation. Thus, \u03b2-citraurin esters, instead of anthocyanins imparted reddish color to the ripe fruit. These pigments and their biosynthesis in R. chingii are totally different from what occurs in other raspberry species.",

    "abstract": "Sterile male Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt), fed as immature adults on the plant compound raspberry ketone (RK), show a reduced attraction to cuelure, a synthetic analogue of RK used as an attractant in Male Annihilation Technique. We hypothesized the reduced attraction of RK-fed adult males to cuelure may be a consequence of altered expression of chemoreception genes. A Y-tube olfactometer assay with RK-fed and RK-unfed sterile B. tryoni males tested the subsequent behavioural response to cuelure. Behavioral assays confirmed a significant decrease in attraction of RK-fed sterile males to cuelure. RK-fed, non-responders (to cue-lure) and RK-unfed, responders (to cue-lure) males were sampled and gene expression compared by de novo RNA-seq analysis. A total of 269 genes in fly heads were differentially expressed between replicated groups of RK-fed, cuelure non-responders and RK-unfed, cuelure responders. Among them, 218 genes including 4 chemoreceptor genes were up regulated and 51 genes were down regulated in RK-fed, cuelure non-responders. De novo assembly generated many genes with unknown functions and no significant BLAST hits to homologues in other species. The enriched and suppressed genes reported here, shed light on the transcriptional changes that affect the dynamics of insect responses to chemical stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Promoting the consumption of fruits is a key objective of nutrition policy campaigns due to their associated health benefits. Raspberries are well appreciated for their remarkable flavor and nutritional value attributable to their antioxidant properties. Consequently, one of the objectives of present-day raspberry breeding programs is to improve the fruit's sensory and nutritive characteristics. However, developing new genotypes with enhanced quality traits is a complex task due to the intricate impacts genetic and environmental factors have on these attributes, and the difficulty to phenotype them. We used a multi-platform metabolomic approach to compare flavor- and nutritional-related metabolite profiles of four raspberry cultivars ('Glen Ample', 'Sch\u00f6nemann', 'Tulameen' and 'Veten') grown in different European climates. Although the cultivars appear to be better adapted to high latitudes, for their content in soluble solids and acidity, multivariate statistical analyses allowed us to underscore important genotypic differences based on the profiles of important metabolites. 'Sch\u00f6nemann' and 'Veten' were characterized by high levels of anthocyanins and ellagitannins, respectively, 'Tulameen' by its acidity, and 'Glen Ample' for its content of sucrose and \u03b2-ionone, two main flavor contributors. Our results confirmed the value of metabolomic-driven approaches, which may foster the development of cultivars with enhanced health properties and flavor.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone is one of the characteristic flavors of raspberry fruits, and it is an important and expensive ingredient in the flavor and fragrance industries. It is present at low levels in plant tissues, and its occurrence is limited to a few taxa. In this context, the stable production of nature-identical raspberry ketone using heterologous synthesis in plants hosts has recently garnered the attention of plant biochemists. In this study, we demonstrate the rational switching of the metabolic flow from anthocyanin pigments to volatile phenylbutanoid production via the phenylpropanoid pathway. This shift led to the efficient and stable production of raspberry ketone and its glycosides via heterologous expression of the biosynthetic enzymes benzalacetone synthase (BAS) and raspberry ketone/zingerone synthase 1 (RZS1) in the transgenic tobacco (",

    "abstract": "Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) provides an excellent opportunity to investigate better automatic medical decision support tools with the effective integration of various medical equipment and associated data. This study explores two such medical decision-making tasks, namely COVID-19 detection and lung area segmentation detection, using chest radiography images. We also explore different cutting-edge machine learning techniques, such as federated learning, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning to explore the issue. To analyze the applicability of computationally less capable edge devices in the IoMT system, we report the results using Raspberry Pi devices as accuracy, precision, recall, Fscore for COVID-19 detection, and average dice score for lung segmentation detection tasks. We also publish the results obtained through server-centric simulation for comparison. The results show that Raspberry Pi-centric devices provide better performance in lung segmentation detection, and server-centric experiments provide better results in COVID-19 detection. We also discuss the IoMT application-centric settings, utilizing medical data and decision support systems, and posit that such a system could benefit all the stakeholders in the IoMT domain.",

    "abstract": "Combined transcriptomic and metabolic analyses reveal that fruit of Rubus chingii Hu launches biosynthesis of phenolic acids and flavonols at beginning of fruit set and then coordinately accumulated or converted to their derivatives. Rubus chingii Hu (Chinese raspberry) is an important dual functional food with nutraceutical and pharmaceutical values. Comprehensively understanding the mechanisms of fruit development and bioactive components synthesis and regulation could accelerate genetic analysis and molecular breeding for the unique species. Combined transcriptomic and metabolic analyses of R. chingii fruits from different developmental stages, including big green, green-to-yellow, yellow-to-orange, and red stages, were conducted. A total of 89,188 unigenes were generated and 57,545 unigenes (64.52%) were annotated. Differential expression genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were mainly involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The fruit launched the biosynthesis of phenolic acids and flavonols at the very beginning of fruit set and then coordinately accumulated or converted to their derivatives. This was tightly regulated by expressions of the related genes and MYB and bHLH transcription factors. The core genes products participated in the biosynthesis of ellagic acid (EA) and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (K-3-R), such as DAHPS, DQD/SDH, PAL, 4CL, CHS, CHI, F3H, F3'H, FLS, and UGT78D2, and their corresponding metabolites were elaborately characterized. Our research reveals the molecular and chemical mechanisms of the fruit development of R. chingii. The results provide a solid foundation for the genetic analysis, functional genes isolation, fruit quality improvement and modifiable breeding of R. chingii.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketones have important therapeutic properties such as anti-influenza and prevention of diabetes. In order to obtain raspberry ketone from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, two enzymes catalyzing the last two steps of raspberry ketone synthesis, i.e. 4-coumaryl-CoA ligase (4CL) and polyketide synthase (PKS1), were fused using a glycine-serine-glycine (GSG) tripeptide linker to construct an expression vector pChla-4CL-PKS1. The fusion gene 4CL-PKS1 driven by a PSAD promoter was transformed into a wild-type (CC125) and a cell wall-deficient C. reinhardtii (CC425) by electroporation. The results showed the recombinant C. reinhardtii strain CC125 and CC425 with 4CL-PKS1 produced raspberry ketone at a level of 6.7 \u03bcg/g (fresh weight) and 5.9 \u03bcg/g (fresh weight), respectively, both were higher than that of the native raspberry ketone producing plants (2-4 \u03bcg/g).",

    "abstract": "The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a sustainable pest management tool based on the release of millions of sterile insects that suppress reproduction in targeted populations. Success of SIT depends on survival, maturation, dispersal, and mating of released sterile insects. Laboratory and field cage studies have demonstrated that dietary supplements of methoprene and raspberry ketone (RK) promote sexual maturation of adult Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt), and may hence shorten the delay between release and maturity in the field. We investigated the effects of methoprene and RK dietary supplements on field abundance of sexually mature sterile Q-flies relative to untreated flies fed only sugar and yeast hydrolysate before release at 2 d of age. Compared with untreated flies, more methoprene- and RK-treated flies were recaptured in cuelure traps to which only sexually mature males are attracted. At distances of 100 and 200 m from the release point, recapture rates were higher for methoprene- and RK-treated flies than for untreated flies, but at 300 m recapture rates were low and were similar for treated and untreated flies. Rainfall, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction did not affect recapture rates, but temperature was positively correlated with recapture rates for all treatments. There was a strong correlation between the number of sterile and wild flies caught in traps, indicating co-location in the field. Dietary supplements of methoprene and RK can substantially increase abundance of sexually mature sterile male Q-flies in the field following release as 2-d-old immature adults.",

    "abstract": "In auditory behavioral and EEG experiments, the variability of stimulation solutions, for both software and hardware, adds unnecessary technical constraints. Currently, there is no easy to use, inexpensive, and shareable solution that could improve collaborations and data comparisons across different sites and contexts. This article outlines a system composed by a Raspberry Pi coupled with Python programming and associated with a HifiBerry sound card. We compare its sound performances with those of a wide variety of materials and configurations. This solution achieves the high timing accuracy and sound quality important in auditory cognition experiments, while being simple to use and open source. The present system shows high performances and results along with excellent feedback from users. It is inexpensive, easy to build, share, and improve on. Working with such low-cost, powerful, and collaborative hardware and software tools allows people to create their own specific, adapted, and shareable system that can be standardized across different collaborative sites, while being extremely simple and robust in use.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Previously, we reported that blueberry extract constrains the growth of CC. Raspberry is a widely consumed fruit that exhibits antitumor properties against several cancer types but little is known about its direct effect on CC. This study was designed to investigate the potential antitumor effect of raspberry extract (RE) on CC cells and to elucidate the possible mechanisms behind it.\nClonogenic survival assay and caspase-3 activity kits were used to evaluate the effects of RE on cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis of a widely used CC cell line, HeLa. Possible molecular mechanisms were investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.\nThe percentage of colonies and optic density value of HeLa cells decreased in the presence of RE in comparison to controls. Relative caspase-3 activity in cancer cells increased in the presence of RE in comparison to controls. The antitumor effect displayed on HeLa cells by RE was associated with the increased expression of antiproliferative molecule P53 and the increased expression of pro-apoptotic molecule tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6 (FAS).\nRE displays anticancer activity against CC HeLa cells. The mechanism behind this is by up-regulation of anti-proliferative molecule P53 and pro-apoptotic molecule FAS.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK) is an aromatic phenolic compound naturally occurring in red raspberries, kiwifruit, peaches, and apples and reported for its potential therapeutic and nutraceutical properties. Studies in cells and rodents have suggested an important role for RK in hepatic/cardio/gastric protection and as an anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-obesity, depigmentation, and sexual maturation agent. Raspberry ketone-mediated activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR-\u03b1) stands out as one of its main modes of action. Although rodent studies have demonstrated the efficacious effects of RK, its mechanism remains largely unknown. In spite of a lack of reliable human research, RK is marketed as a health supplement, at very high doses. In this review, we provide a compilation of scientific research that has been conducted so far, assessing the therapeutic properties of RK in several disease conditions as well as inspiring future research before RK can be considered safe and efficacious with limited side effects as an alternative to modern medicines in the treatment of major lifestyle-based diseases.",

    "abstract": "Control of the shape and uniformity of colloid particles is essential for realizing their functionality in various applications. Herein, we report a facile approach for the synthesis of narrowly dispersed anisotropic microparticles with well-defined raspberry-like and golf ball-like surface patterns. First, we demonstrate that hybrid raspberry-like particles can be achieved through a one-pot polymerization method using glycidyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (GPOSS) and pentaerythritol tetra(3-mercaptopropionate) (PETMP) as monomers. Varying the polymerization parameters such as catalyst loading, monomer concentration, and the molar ratio of monomers, we are able to regulate the sizes and surface protrusion numbers of these raspberry-like microparticles. The formation mechanism is attributed to a competition balance between thiol-epoxy reaction and thiol-thiol coupling reaction. The former promotes rapid formation of large core particles between PETMP and GPOSS droplets (which can serve as core particles), while the latter allows for generation of surface protrusions by PETMP self-polymerization, leading to the formation of raspberry-like surface patterns. Based on the different POSS contents in the surface protrusions and cores of the raspberry-like microparticles, we demonstrate that they can be used as precursors to produce microporous silica (sub)microparticles with golf ball-like morphology ",

    "abstract": "The development of high-performance protein-imprinted materials is vital to meet the requirements of proteomics research but remains a challenge. Herein, a new type of raspberry-like cytochrome C-imprinted nanoparticle was first designed and fabricated via surface imprinting technology combined with a template immobilization strategy. In particular, the state-of-the-art metal-organic framework (MOF)/carbon nanoparticle (CN) composites were selected as protein immobilization carriers for two advantages: (1) the composites reflected the intrinsic characteristics of MOFs including flexible design, facile preparation, and extensive interactions with proteins and (2) the utilization of composites also overcame the issue associated with the severe agglomeration of individual MOFs during the post-use process. Therefore, the as-prepared composites exhibited a regular raspberry-like shape with good dispersion (polydispersity index (PDI) < 0.25), high specific surface area (551.4 m",

Originally, we developed the EcoFlex system, a Golden Gate toolkit, to study genes/pathways flexibly using\u00a0Escherichia coli\u00a0heterologous expression. In this current work, we sought to use EcoFlex to optimise a synthetic raspberry ketone biosynthetic pathway.\u00a0Raspberry ketone is a high-value (~\u2009\u00a320,000\u00a0kg\n\u00a0By applying a synthetic biology led design-build-test-learn cycle approach, we refactor the raspberry ketone pathway from a low level of productivity (0.2\u00a0mg/L), to achieve a 65-fold (12.9\u00a0mg/L) improvement in production.\u00a0We perform this optimisation at the prototype level (using microtiter plate cultures) with E. coli DH10\u03b2, as a routine cloning host. The use of E. coli DH10\u03b2 facilitates the Golden Gate cloning process for the screening of combinatorial libraries. In addition, we also newly establish a novel colour-based phenotypic screen to identify productive clones quickly from solid/liquid culture.\n\u00a0Our findings provide a stable raspberry ketone pathway that relies upon a natural feedstock (L-tyrosine) and uses only constitutive promoters to control gene expression.

    "abstract": "Although Dietary supplements are readily accessible and extensively used worldwide, they are inadequately regulated and consumers are victims of manufacturers' fraud. Thus, quality regulations are required to ensure safety of products available to the public. We propose the first native spectrofluorimetric quality control assay of raspberry ketone, a popular dietary supplement ingredient for weight loss. This work relies on the constant wavelength synchronous scan of the Raspberry Ketone native fluorescence, overcoming the demerits of conventional excitation/ emission spectra. For the best measurement conditions, several parameters were optimized including \u0394\u03bb value, diluting solvent, medium pH and the effect of surfactants/ macromolecules. In aqueous medium (\u0394\u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0110\u00a0nm), a linear relationship exists between synchronous fluorescence intensity at peak maximum 405.6\u00a0nm and solution concentration in the range 300-1500\u00a0ng/mL. Method sensitivity was recorded with LOD and LOQ values 60.63 and 183.72\u00a0ng/mL; respectively. Validation was done in accordance to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. This simple procedure was successfully applied to the analysis of Raspberry Ketone in commercially available dietary supplement capsules with average recovery 98.67% \u00b1 1.74 and further extended to weight variation testing following the official United States Pharmacopeial (USP) guidelines. Finally, green assessment was done using the ''Analytical Eco-scale'' tool. The total score was 89/100 points revealing excellent greenness of our proposal. Our proposal is simple, eco-friendly and cheap. It can be conveniently adopted for routine quality control practices especially in developing countries.",

    "abstract": "Single-board computers (SBCs) and microcontroller boards (MCBs) are extensively used nowadays as prototyping platforms to accomplish innovative tasks. Very recently, implementations of these devices for diagnostics applications are rapidly gaining ground for research and educational purposes. Among the available solutions, Raspberry Pi represents one of the most used SBCs. In the present work, two setups based on Raspberry Pi and its CMOS-based camera (a 3D-printed device and an adaptation of a commercial product named We-Lab) were investigated as diagnostic instruments. Different camera elaboration processes were investigated, showing how direct access to the 10-bit raw data acquired from the sensor before downstream imaging processes could be beneficial for photometric applications. The developed solution was successfully applied to the evaluation of the oxidative stress using two commercial kits (d-ROM Fast; PAT). We suggest the analysis of raw data applied to SBC and MCB platforms in order to improve results.",

    "abstract": "Sporadic foveolar-type gastric adenoma (FGA) has been described as an extremely rare polyp that is whitish and flatly elevated. However, we recently found that sporadic FGA with a raspberry-like appearance (FGA-RA) is not rare in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-na\u00efve gastric mucosa. We endoscopically or surgically treated 647 patients with gastric epithelial neoplasms in the last 5 years, with 7.7% (50/647) being H. pylori-na\u00efve. Among these, 43 FGA-RAs were diagnosed based on histologic and endoscopic features in 34 patients, who were all enrolled in this retrospective study. All lesions were observed by white-light endoscopy (WLE) and narrow-band imaging with magnification endoscopy (NBIME). We subsequently analyzed their endoscopic and microscopic features and patient characteristics. The patients were 22 males and 12 females aged 57\u00b123 years (mean\u00b12SD). WLE showed raspberry-like small polyps mimicking gastric hyperplastic polyps in the oxyntic gastric compartment (body/fundus). Multiple growths were confirmed in 20.6% (7/34) of the patients. NBIME revealed irregularly shaped papillary/gyrus-like microstructures with abnormal capillaries. Histologically, all lesions were intraepithelial neoplasms, and most of lesions (62.8%, 27/43) exhibited low-grade dysplasia. Immunohistochemically, neoplastic cells featured strong and diffuse MUC5AC expression, negative or very low MUC6 expression, and negative MUC2/CD10 expression. They also showed Ki-67 hyperexpression with a mean labeling index of 59.4\u00b148.7%. The coexistence of fundic gland polyps in the background mucosa was significantly higher in multiple FGA-RA cases than in solitary cases (100% vs. 55.5%, P< 0.05). FGA-RA is a newly suggested histologic variant of sporadic FGA whose occurrence is not rare in daily endoscopic practice.",

    "abstract": "Over one third of crops are animal pollinated, with insects being the largest group. In some crops, including strawberries, fruit yield, weight, quality, aesthetics and shelf life increase with insect pollination. Many crops are protected from extreme weather in polytunnels, but the impacts of polytunnels on insects are poorly understood. Polytunnels could reduce pollination services, especially if insects have access issues. Here we examine the distribution and activity of honeybees and non-honeybee wild insects on a commercial fruit farm. We evaluated whether insect distributions are impacted by flower type (strawberry; raspberry; weed), or distance from polytunnel edges. We compared passive pan-trapping and active quadrat observations to establish their suitability for monitoring insect distribution and behaviour on a farm. To understand the relative value of honeybees compared to other insects for strawberry pollination, the primary crop at the site, we enhanced our observations with video data analysed using insect tracking software to document the time spent by insects on flowers. The results show honeybees strongly prefer raspberry and weed flowers over strawberry flowers and that location within the polytunnel impacts insect distributions. Consistent with recent studies, we also show that pan-traps are ineffective to sample honeybee numbers. While the pan-traps and quadrat observations tend to suggest that investment in managed honeybees for strawberry pollination might be ineffective due to consistent low numbers within the crop, the camera data provides contrary evidence. Although honeybees were relatively scarce among strawberry crops, camera data shows they spent more time visiting flowers than other insects. Our results demonstrate that a commercial fruit farm is a complex ecosystem influencing pollinator diversity and abundance through a range of factors. We show that monitoring methods may differ in their valuation of relative contributions of insects to crop pollination.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone is a widely used flavor compound in food and cosmetic industry. Several processes for its biocatalytic production have already been described, but either with the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) or incomplete conversion of the variety of precursors that are available in nature. Such natural precursors are rhododendrol glycosides with different proportions of (R)- and (S)-rhododendrol depending on the origin. After hydrolysis of these rhododendrol glycosides, the formed rhododendrol enantiomers have to be oxidized to obtain the final product raspberry ketone. To be able to achieve a high conversion with different starting material, we assembled an alcohol dehydrogenase toolbox that can be accessed depending on the optical purity of the intermediate rhododendrol. This is demonstrated by converting racemic rhododendrol using a combination of (R)- and (S)-selective alcohol dehydrogenases together with a universal cofactor recycling system. Furthermore, we conducted a biocatalytic cascade reaction starting from naturally derived rhododendrol glycosides by the use of a glucosidase and an alcohol dehydrogenase to produce raspberry ketone in high yield. KEY POINTS: \u2022 LB-ADH, LK-ADH and LS-ADH oxidize (R)-rhododendrol \u2022 RR-ADH and ADH1E oxidize (S)-rhododendrol \u2022 Raspberry ketone production via glucosidase and alcohol dehydrogenases from a toolbox.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of COVID-19 is of vital demand. Several studies have been conducted to decide whether the chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans of patients indicate COVID-19. While these efforts resulted in successful classification systems, the design of a portable and cost-effective COVID-19 diagnosis system has not been addressed yet. The memory requirements of the current state-of-the-art COVID-19 diagnosis systems are not suitable for embedded systems due to the required large memory size of these systems (e.g., hundreds of megabytes). Thus, the current work is motivated to design a similar system with minimal memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a diagnosis system using a Raspberry Pi Linux embedded system. First, local features are extracted using local binary pattern (LBP) algorithm. Second, the global features are extracted from the chest X-ray or CT scans using multi-channel fractional-order Legendre-Fourier moments (MFrLFMs). Finally, the most significant features (local and global) are selected. The proposed system steps are integrated to fit the low computational and memory capacities of the embedded system. The proposed method has the smallest computational and memory resources,less than the state-of-the-art methods by two to three orders of magnitude, among existing state-of-the-art deep learning (DL)-based methods.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a common cause of death and disability. However, existing tools for TBI diagnosis are either subjective or require extensive clinical setup and expertise. The increasing affordability and reduction in the size of relatively high-performance computing systems combined with promising results from TBI related machine learning research make it possible to create compact and portable systems for early detection of TBI. This work describes a Raspberry Pi based portable, real-time data acquisition, and automated processing system that uses machine learning to efficiently identify TBI and automatically score sleep stages from a single-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. We discuss the design, implementation, and verification of the system that can digitize the EEG signal using an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) and perform real-time signal classification to detect the presence of mild TBI (mTBI). We utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and XGBoost based predictive models to evaluate the performance and demonstrate the versatility of the system to operate with multiple types of predictive models. We achieve a peak classification accuracy of more than 90% with a classification time of less than 1 s across 16-64 s epochs for TBI vs. control conditions. This work can enable the development of systems suitable for field use without requiring specialized medical equipment for early TBI detection applications and TBI research. Further, this work opens avenues to implement connected, real-time TBI related health and wellness monitoring systems.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of raspberry juice addition on the content of phenolic compounds and the antioxidant activity of wafers. The research was carried out on non-supplemented wafers (control) and wafers in which water was replaced with raspberry juice in the amount of 10%, 20%, 50%, 75% and 100%. The potential bioavailability of the phenolic compounds after in vitro digestion was also determined. As shown by the consumer assessment, wafers in which the water was replaced with 100% raspberry juice turned out to be the best variant of the enriched wafers. The content of total phenolic compounds, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and anthocyanins in the tested products increased with the increasing amount of raspberry juice added to the wafers. The fortification of the wafers with raspberry juice had a positive effect on the antioxidant activity, expressed as the ability to neutralize free radicals ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) and DPPH (di(phenyl)-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)iminoazanium), the ability to chelate iron ions, and as the reduction power. The simulated digestion increased the content of phenolic compounds and increased the antioxidant activity of the wafers. The ability to inhibit lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (i.e., enzymes involved in the induction of inflammation), varied and depended on both the amount of raspberry juice added and the type of extract.",

After 4 weeks, blood samples were obtained and left testes were removed and prepared for histopathological studies. Serum levels of Luteinizing hormone (LH), Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, Nitric oxide (NO), and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity level were assayed.

Data were analyzed using ANOVA (one-way analysis of variance).\nSerum levels of LH, FSH and MDA significantly increased in diabetic rats, however, treatment with the extract significantly reversed the alterations. Serum levels of testosterone and NO, activity of SOD and CAT, and sperm number and motility significantly decreased and severe destruction of testicular histology was observed in diabetic animals while treatment with the extract significantly reversed the pathologic alterations observed in diabetic rats. According to the results, 100 and 200 mg/kg of the extract were able to effectively reverse the diabetes complications.\nOur findings demonstrated that the fruit extract of raspberry has protective effects on male reproductive system in diabetic rats partially due to its improving effects on NO system, and SOD and CAT activity.",

    "abstract": "We report on a simple method for an active position stabilization of an atomic cloud trapped in a magneto-optical trap operating on the narrow 182 kHz intercombination line of atomic ytterbium. Our method makes use of the significant sensitivity of the position of a narrow-line magneto-optical trap (MOT) on the laser frequency. After in situ detection of the MOT position using a Pi Camera, an error signal is generated by a Raspberry Pi, which is directly fed back onto the laser frequency. Thus, perturbations of the MOT position, e.g., due to drifts of the Zerodur cavity to which the MOT laser is stabilized or the ambient magnetic field, can be compensated directly. Our method allows for long-term stabilization of the MOT position on a 10 \u00b5m scale and thus improves loading of a tightly focused optical trap.",

    "abstract": "Carotenoids are one of the most abundant pigments in raspberries. Rubus chingii Hu, indigenous to China, is traditionally consumed for health benefits. However, the carotenoid composition and pathways of R. chingii have not yet been studied. In this study, the components of carotenoids and genes/proteins involved in their biosynthesis were investigated during four fruit ripening phases via LC-MS/MS. Zeaxanthin, \u03b2-citraurin and its esters, first identified in Rubus, gradually accumulated during fruit maturation. These compounds, rather than anthocyanins, were responsible for the ripe fruit coloration. In carotenoid metabolism, upstream synthesis genes of RcPSY2 (CL1406.Contig2), RcPDS1 (CL7625.Contig2), RcZDS1 (CL590.Contig6) and RcCRTISO1 (CL6919.Contig2) were up-regulated in gene/protein expression to accelerate carotene biosynthesis. Downstream genes of RcLUT5CHYB/CYP97A (CL8884.Contig3) and RcCHYB/BCH (CL7966.Contig1) were up-regulated in gene/protein expression, while RcCHYE/CYP97C (CL9380.Contig1/2) were maintained at low levels. RcLCYE (Unigene19570) was down-regulated while RcLCYB (CL7586.Contig1) was up-regulated and then down-regulated. These differential gene/protein expressions between LCYB and LCYE, and between CHYE and CHYB led to zeaxanthin accumulation by elevating its biosynthetic enzymes and lowering enzymes for lutein biosynthesis. In apocarotenoid biosynthesis, RcCCD (CL1310.Contig3) was up-regulated in gene/protein expression, which raised the content of \u03b2-citraurin and its esters. Additionally, these genes/proteins diverged into different subgroups with distinct pattens of expression, suggesting their difference in function. For example, RcPSY1/3, RcZDS2, and RcCRTISO2/3 genes were expressed at very low levels, suggesting that they may be active in other tissues rather than in fruit. The mechanism of zeaxanthin and \u03b2-citraurin biosynthesis is responsible for fruit coloration, which is completely novel to Rubus.",

    "abstract": "This study examined, the effect of chemically extracted raspberry pomace on the thermal stability, mechanical properties, flammability, chemical structure and processing of poly(vinyl chloride). It was observed that the pomace in this study was used to extract naphtha, thereby permitting the removal of bio-oil as a factor preventing the obtaining of homogeneous composites. Furthermore, adding 20% raspberry pomace filler after extraction extended the thermal stability time for the composites by about 30%. It was observed that composite density, impact strength, and tensile strength values decreased significantly with increasing concentrations of filler in the PVC matrix. At the same time, their modulus of elasticity and Shore hardness increased. All tested composites were characterized by a good burning resistance with a flammability rating of V0 according to the UL94 test. Adding 20 to 40% of a natural filler to the PVC matrix made it possible to obtain composites for the production of flame resistant elements that emitted less hydrogen chloride under fire conditions while ensuring good rigidity.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is closely linked to various diseases, and many studies have been conducted to determine how to reduce this stress. In particular, efforts are being made to find potential antioxidants from natural products. Studies have shown that raspberry ketone (RK; 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone) has various pharmacological activities. This review summarizes the antioxidant activities of RK and their underlying mechanisms. In several experimental models, it was proven that RK exhibits antioxidant properties through increasing total antioxidant capacity (TAC); upregulating antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT); and improving lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, research about RK's antioxidant activities is directly or indirectly related to its other various physiological activities. Further studies at the clinical level will be able to verify the value of RK as an effective antioxidant, functional health food, and therapeutic agent.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, nonalcoholic fatty liver disorders have become one of the most common liver pathologies; therefore, it is necessary to investigate the dietary compounds that may support the regulation of liver metabolism and related inflammatory processes. The present study examines the effect of raspberry polyphenolic extract (RE) combined with fructo-oligosaccharides (FOSs) or pectins (PECs) on caecal microbial fermentation, liver lipid metabolism and inflammation in rats with fatty liver induced by an obesogenic diet. The combination of RE with FOSs or PECs reduced the production of short-chain fatty acids in the caecum. RE combined with FOSs exerted the most favourable effects on liver lipid metabolism by decreasing liver fat, cholesterol, triglyceride content and hepatic steatosis. RE and FOSs reduced lobular and portal inflammatory cell infiltration and IL-6 plasma levels. These effects might be related to a decrease in the hepatic expressions of PPAR\u03b3 and ANGPTL4. In conclusion, PECs and FOSs enhanced the effects of RE against disorders related to nonalcoholic fatty liver; however, the most effective dietary treatment in the regulation of liver lipid metabolism and inflammation caused by an obesogenic diet was the combination of RE with FOSs.",

    "abstract": "Spotted wing drosophila (SWD) causes significant economic loss in fruit crops to growers worldwide. There is immediate need for efficacious and selective monitoring tools that can detect infestations early. Previously, volatile organic compounds derived from apple were studied and a quinary chemical component blend (QB) was identified as the key SWD attractant in a blueberry orchard in the United States. This study's aim was to determine whether previously observed QB efficacy, selectivity, and early detection levels could be attained within raspberry and cherry fields in the USA and Europe. Results demonstrated that sticky trap baited QB dispenser provided earlier SWD detection potential than the usually adopted apple cider vinegar (ACV) trap. The number of SWD captured/trap by QB baited trapping systems was significantly lower than that of the ACV trap. However, percent SWD/trap of QB baited traps was same within cherry. Lower non-target capture will save farmer/grower's labor and time allocated to traps installation and drosophila species identification. Within the USA, SWD selectivity of QB baited liquid traps was consistently greater than sticky trap in raspberry field, suggesting that the QB dispenser can be an alternative to the standard ACV lure and that trap design could improve selectivity further.",

    "abstract": "Phenylpropanoid including raspberry ketone, is a kind of important natural plant product and widely used in pharmaceuticals, chemicals, cosmetics, and healthcare products. Bioproduction of phenylpropanoid in Escherichia coli and other microbial cell factories is an attractive approach considering the low phenylpropanoid contents in plants. However, it is usually difficult to produce high titer phenylpropanoid production when fermentation using glucose as carbon source. Developing novel bioprocess using alternative sources might provide a solution to this problem. In this study, typical phenylpropanoid raspberry ketone was used as the target product to develop a biosynthesis pathway for phenylpropanoid production from fatty acids, a promising alternative low-cost feedstock.\nA raspberry ketone biosynthesis module was developed and optimized by introducing 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), benzalacetone synthase (BAS), and raspberry ketone reductase (RZS) in Escherichia coli strains CR1-CR4. Then strain CR5 was developed by introducing raspberry ketone biosynthesis module into a fatty acids-utilization chassis FA09 to achieve production of raspberry ketone from fatty acids feedstock. However, the production of raspberry ketone was still limited by the low biomass and unable to substantiate whole-cell bioconversion process. Thus, a process by coordinately using fatty-acids and glycerol was developed. In addition, we systematically screened and optimized fatty acids-response promoters. The optimized promoter Pfrd3 was then successfully used for the efficient expression of key enzymes of raspberry ketone biosynthesis module during bioconversion from fatty acids. The final engineered strain CR8 could efficiently produce raspberry ketone repeatedly using bioconversion from fatty acids feedstock strategy, and was able to produce raspberry ketone to a concentration of 180.94 mg/L from soybean oil in a 1-L fermentation process.\nMetabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains were successfully developed for raspberry ketone production from fatty acids using several strategies, including optimization of bioconversion process and fine-tuning key enzyme expression. This study provides an essential reference to establish the low-cost biological manufacture of phenylpropanoids compounds.",

    "results": "A raspberry ketone biosynthesis module was developed and optimized by introducing 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), benzalacetone synthase (BAS), and raspberry ketone reductase (RZS) in Escherichia coli strains CR1-CR4. Then strain CR5 was developed by introducing raspberry ketone biosynthesis module into a fatty acids-utilization chassis FA09 to achieve production of raspberry ketone from fatty acids feedstock. However, the production of raspberry ketone was still limited by the low biomass and unable to substantiate whole-cell bioconversion process. Thus, a process by coordinately using fatty-acids and glycerol was developed. In addition, we systematically screened and optimized fatty acids-response promoters. The optimized promoter Pfrd3 was then successfully used for the efficient expression of key enzymes of raspberry ketone biosynthesis module during bioconversion from fatty acids. The final engineered strain CR8 could efficiently produce raspberry ketone repeatedly using bioconversion from fatty acids feedstock strategy, and was able to produce raspberry ketone to a concentration of 180.94 mg/L from soybean oil in a 1-L fermentation process.",

    "abstract": "Childbearing women have been using various herbs to assist with pregnancy, labour and birth for centuries. One of the most common is raspberry leaf. The evidence base for the use of raspberry leaf is however under-developed. It is incumbent on midwives and other maternity care providers to provide women with evidence-based information so they can make informed choices. The aim of this study was to review the research literature to identify the evidence base on the biophysical effects, safety and efficacy of raspberry leaf in pregnancy.\nA systematic, integrative review was undertaken. Six databases were searched to identify empirical research papers published in peer reviewed journals including in vitro, in vivo, human and animal studies. The search included the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection and AMED. Identified studies were appraised independently by two reviewers using the MMAT appraisal instrument. An integrative approach was taken to analysis.\nThirteen studies were included. Five were laboratory studies using animal and human tissue, two were experiments using animals, and six were human studies. Included studies were published between 1941 and 2016. Raspberry leaf has been shown to have biophysical effects on animal and human smooth muscle including the uterus. Toxity was demonstrated when high doses were administered intravenously or intaperitoneally in animal studies. Human studies have not shown any harm or benefit though one study demonstrated a clinically meaningful (though non-statistically significant) reduction in length of second stage and augmentation of labour in women taking raspberry leaf.\nMany women use raspberry leaf in pregnancy to facilitate labour and birth. The evidence base supporting the use of raspeberry leaf in pregnancy is weak and further research is needed to address the question of raspberry leaf's effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Diets rich in fruit and vegetables are associated with a decreased incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) due, in part, to the bioactive (poly)phenolic components and their microbiota-mediated metabolites. This study investigated how such compounds, derived from ingested raspberries in the gastrointestinal tract, may exert protective effects by reducing DNA damage. Ileal fluids collected pre- and post-consumption of 300\u00a0g of raspberries by ileostomists (n\u00a0=\u00a011) were subjected to 24\u00a0h ex vivo fermentation with fecal inoculum to simulate interaction with colonic microbiota. The impact of fermentation on (poly)phenolics in ileal fluid was determined and the bioactivity of ileal fluids pre- and post fermentation investigated. (Poly)phenolic compounds including sanguiin H-6, sanguiin H-10 and cyanidin-3-O-sophoroside decreased significantly during fermentation while, in contrast, microbial catabolites, including 3-(3'-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and benzoic acid increased significantly. The post-raspberry ileal fermentate from 9 of the 11 ileostomates significantly decreased DNA damage (~30%) in the CCD 841 CoN normal cell line using an oxidative challenge COMET assay. The raspberry ileal fermentates also modulated gene expression of the nuclear factor 2-antioxidant responsive element (Nrf2-ARE) pathway involved in oxidative stress cytoprotection, namely Nrf2, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone-1 and heme oxygenase-1. Four of the phenolic catabolites were assessed individually, each significantly reducing DNA damage from an oxidative challenge over a physiologically relevant 10-100\u00a0\u03bcM range. They also induced a differential pattern of expression of key genes in the Nrf2-ARE pathway in CCD 841 CoN cells. The study indicates that the colon-available raspberry (poly)phenols and their microbial-derived catabolites may play a role in protection against CRC in vivo.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the development of biocompatible oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsions based on polyglycerol esters, as promising carriers for natural actives: red raspberry seed oil-RO and hydro-glycolic fruit extracts from red raspberry-RE and French oak-FE. Nanoemulsions were obtained via phase inversion composition (PIC) method at room temperature by dilution of microemulsion phase, confirmed by visual appearance, percentage of transmittance, microscopic, rheological and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) investigations. The results have shown that the basic RO-loaded formulation could be further enriched with hydro-glycolic fruit extracts from red raspberry or French oak, while keeping a semi-transparent appearance due to the fine droplet size (Z-ave: 50 to 70 nm, PDI value \u2264 0.1). The highest antioxidant activity (~92% inhibition of the DPPH radical) was achieved in the formulation containing both lipophilic (RO) and hydrophilic antioxidants (FE), due to their synergistic effect. The nanoemulsion carrier significantly increased the selective cytotoxic effect of RO towards malignant melanoma (Fem-X) cells, compared to normal human keratinocytes (HaCaT). In vivo study on human volunteers showed satisfactory safety profiles and significant improvement in skin hydration during 2 h after application for all nanoemulsions. Therefore, polyglycerol ester-based nanoemulsions can be promoted as effective carriers for red raspberry seed oil and/or hydro-glycolic fruit extracts in topical formulations intended for skin protection and hydration.",

    "abstract": "Chest examination by auscultation is essential in patients with COVID-19, especially those with poor respiratory conditions, such as severe pneumonia and respiratory dysfunction, and intensive cases who are intubated and whose breathing is assisted with a ventilator. However, proper auscultation of these patients is difficult when medical workers wear personal protective equipment and when it is necessary to minimize contact with patients.\nThe objective of our study was to design and develop a low-cost electronic stethoscope enabling ear-contactless auscultation and digital storage of data for further analysis. The clinical feasibility of our device was assessed in comparison to a standard electronic stethoscope.\nWe developed a prototype of the ear-contactless electronic stethoscope, called Auscul Pi, powered by Raspberry Pi and Python. Our device enables real-time capture of auscultation sounds with a microspeaker instead of an earpiece, and it can store data files for later analysis. We assessed the feasibility of using this stethoscope by detecting abnormal heart and respiratory sounds from 8 patients with heart failure or structural heart diseases and from 2 healthy volunteers and by comparing the results with those from a 3M Littmann electronic stethoscope.\nWe were able to conveniently operate Auscul Pi and precisely record the patients' auscultation sounds. Auscul Pi showed similar real-time recording and playback performance to the Littmann stethoscope. The phonocardiograms of data obtained with the two stethoscopes were consistent and could be aligned with the cardiac cycles of the corresponding electrocardiograms. Pearson correlation analysis of amplitude data from the two types of phonocardiograms showed that Auscul Pi was correlated with the Littmann stethoscope with coefficients of 0.3245-0.5570 for healthy participants (P<.001) and of 0.3449-0.5138 among 4 patients (P<.001).\nAuscul Pi can be used for auscultation in clinical practice by applying real-time ear-contactless playback followed by quantitative analysis. Auscul Pi may allow accurate auscultation when medical workers are wearing protective suits and have difficulties in examining patients with COVID-19.\nChiCTR.org.cn ChiCTR2000033830; http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=54971.",

    "abstract": "In our investigation, the chemical composition and bioactive potential of leaf buds of raspberry, blackberry, and a raspberry-blackberry hybrid were determined. Antioxidant and antimicrobial properties were tested in water (W), ethanol-water (EW), and glycerol-water (GW) extracts from the buds. These plant organs contain relatively large amounts of minerals, especially Fe. The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) measured by the ABTS and DPPH methods ranged from 2.86 to 12.19 and 6.75 to 24.26 mmol per 100 g fresh weight (FW) of buds, respectively. TAC values were generally higher in the raspberry than in the case of blackberry and raspberry-blackberry hybrid extracts. The antioxidant properties of the extracts were strongly positively correlated with their content of total phenolic (TP). No such relationship was noted for ascorbic acid (AA), whose concentration in all extracts was at a similarly low level. Antioxidant properties determined in vitro were confirmed for the GW extract from raspberry leaf buds in biological test based on the growth parameters of \u0394",

However, only few of them are synthesized and used as electrocatalysts.

    "abstract": "Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) has gained considerable significance in medical fields like implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs), neuro-stimulators etc. The body area networks information with in the implantable medical devices (IMDs) must be secure and their privacy must be protected. The absence of protection at the interface makes it easy for the attackers to take control of the IMDs. Thus, protection of wireless interface has become mandatory in IMDs during key agreement schemes. To secure the key agreement scheme, the most practical light weight bio-cryptosystem schemes popularly known as fuzzy vault (FV) is implemented. The most computationally intensive task in the FV scheme is the chaff point generation process, used for hiding the secret key and valid point inside the vault. Thus, a Raspberry Pi implemented with MATLAB simulation and communication of physiological signal based fast chaff point generation (RPSC) algorithm for WBAN. RPSC algorithm reduced the number of candidate chaff points in the chaff point generation and reduced the overall execution time. The RPSC algorithm has an algorithm complexity of O(n",

    "abstract": "The major aroma-active compounds in clear red raspberry juice were identified by molecular sensory science approaches. Thirty-one aroma-active compounds were identified using detection frequency analysis and aroma extract dilution analysis. Among them, 18 volatiles with aroma activity in red raspberry were identified for the first time, while 14 volatiles with odor activity values (OAVs)\u00a0\u2265\u00a01 were confirmed as the major aroma-active compounds. Three C6 aldehydes showed the highest detection frequencies of 8, and \u03b2-ionone exhibited the highest OAV of 9507 and flavor dilution factor of 512, which indicated that the floral and grassy note could be dominant in overall aroma. Quantitative descriptive analysis suggested that the grassy, floral, woody, and caramel-like notes can be simulated using aroma recombination model 1. Electronic nose analysis also demonstrated that model 1 had closer similarity to the original juice than others. The combination strategy used here would help improve the knowledge of red raspberry aroma.",

    "abstract": "Research has shown that berries may have the ability to reverse, reduce, or slow the progression of behavioral dysfunction associated with aging and neurodegenerative disease. In contrast, high-energy and high-fat diets (HFD) may result in behavioral deficits like those seen in aging animals. This research examined whether red raspberry (\nEight-week-old mice consumed a HFD (60% calories from fat) or a control diet (CD) with and without 4% freeze-dried red raspberry (RB). Behavioral tests and biochemical assays of brain tissue and serum were conducted.\nAfter 12 weeks on the diets, mice fed CD and HFD had impaired novel object recognition, but mice on the RB-supplemented diets did not. After approximately 20 weeks on the diets, mice fed HFD\u2009+\u2009RB had shorter latencies to find the escape hole in the Barnes maze than the HFD-fed mice. Interleukin (IL)-6 was significantly elevated in the cortex of mice fed HFD; while mice fed the CD, CD\u2009+\u2009RB, and HFD\u2009+\u2009RB did not show a similar elevation. There was also evidence of increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brains of mice fed RB diets. This reduction in IL-6 and increase in BDNF may contribute to the preservation of learning and memory in HFD\u2009+\u2009RB mice.\nThis study demonstrates that RB may protect against the effects HFD has on brain and behavior; however, further research with human subjects is needed to confirm these benefits.",
