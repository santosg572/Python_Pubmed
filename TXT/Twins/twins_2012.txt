    "abstract": "Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and their binding proteins (IGFBPs) are known to modulate fetal growth but their role in intrauterine growth of monochorionic twins (MCT) has not been studied.\nCord venous blood was collected directly after birth. IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 in the cord venous blood were quantified by radioimmunoassay. Birth weights (BWs) were obtained electronically. Placentas were examined for chorionicity.\nCord blood was collected in 37 pairs of MCT (15 pairs were males). BWs ranged from 564 to 3240 g, and gestational ages (GAs) were between 24 weeks and 39 weeks. There was a correlation between BW and cord venous blood IGFBP-3 concentration (r = 0.28, p = 0.015), but not between BW and cord venous blood IGF-1 level. There was no difference in IGF-1 between the heavier twins (30.8 \u00b1 61.8 ng/mL) and lighter twins (33.2 \u00b1 63.7 ng/mL), but a trend (p = 0.096) of higher IGFBP-3 level was demonstrated in heavier twins (3.14 \u00b1 1.23 \u03bcg/mL) than in lighter twins (2.71 \u00b1 1.19 \u03bcg/mL). The IGFBP-3 levels were higher (p = 0.042) in female twins (3.20 \u00b1 1.33 \u03bcg/mL) than in male twins (2.64 \u00b1 1.04 \u03bcg/mL). The IGF-1 level of the heavier twins correlated significantly to their lighter co-twin (r = 0.73, p < 0.001).\nOur data showed that cord venous blood IGF-1 level might be controlled mainly by genetic factors.

    "abstract": "This case report defines a case of isolated oligodontia of 9 and 10 permanent teeth in 9-year-old monozygotic twin sisters and gives information about the possible genetic and environmental etiology, related dental anomalies and treatment options. The twins have a negative family history of hypodontia and oligodontia in their parents, as well as their paternal and maternal grandmothers and first cousins. No other dental anomalies could be detected in either of the twins. With the occurrence of similarly located tooth agenesis, except for one tooth, in monozygotic twins, one may consider the influence of genetic and/or environmental factors in their etiology. Hereditary relationships associated with oligodontia could help the clinicians to predict the possibility of its occurrence in other family members and in the next generations. However, clinicians should consider oligodontia when it is not hereditary.",

A total of 663 twin pairs completed the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised and scores were available for Performance, Verbal and Total Intelligence Quotient (IQ). The intrauterine factors examined were birth weight, placental weight and morphology, cord knots, cord length and cord insertion. IQ scores for the varying levels of the intrauterine markers adjusting for gender and gestational age were calculated. The heritability of IQ and the association between IQ and intrauterine environment were examined. Twins with lower birth weight and cord knots had lower IQ scores. The aetiology of IQ is largely distinct from that of birth weight and cord knots, and non-shared environment may influence the observed relationships.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this qualitative research was to explore the needs and difficulties of mothers who had multiple babies at Sakarya County by focusing on their breastfeeding experience. Ten mothers who gave birth to multiple infants participated in the study voluntarily. The framework method of data analysis was applied systematically both within and across cases, with categories and themes identified by reading transcripts of interviews. Major themes generated from focus narrative interviews are described. These themes are: willingness of mothers to breastfeed and continue, management of breastfeeding, use of pacifier, daily life, instructions of healthcare personnel, and advices from practice of experienced mothers. This study showed that women were aware of the importance of mother's milk for their babies. They all, somehow, made intensive efforts to breastfeed their twins. Women who expect and/or have multiple babies need much more support and guidance, which may include advice for nutritional and daily care.",

    "abstract": "Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a focal, idiopathic alteration of subchondral bone structure with the risk for secondary damage to adjacent articular cartilage and the development of premature osteoarthritis. The exact etiology of OCD is unknown, although repetitive microtrauma and vascular insufficiency have been previously described. A genetic predisposition has been suggested, but the existing evidence is sparse. There are multiple case reports of twins and siblings with OCD and a few large family series in the literature, promoting the theory that OCD may have a genetic component to its etiology. This article describes 2 sets of monozygotic twins presenting concurrently with OCD of their dominant knees, offering further support for a genetic component to the etiology of OCD. Interestingly, in both sets of twins, 1 was left-handed and 1 was right-handed. Both sets of twins had simultaneous presentations and clinical courses, lending support to a genetic element to OCD. The development of the OCD lesion in the dominant knee of each patient suggests an environmental influence, perhaps due to repetitive microtrauma and overuse. Recently, a genome-wide linkage study identified a prime candidate locus for OCD. However, despite the suggested association, genetic and developmental factors in the development of OCD remain relatively unstudied. The authors believe monozygotic twins provide an excellent clinical opportunity for future examination of the role of familial inheritance in the etiology of OCD.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins are considered being genetically identical, therefore they cannot be differentiated using standard forensic DNA testing. Here we describe how identification of extremely rare mutations by ultra-deep next generation sequencing can solve such cases. We sequenced DNA from sperm samples of two twins and from a blood sample of the child of one twin. Bioinformatics analysis revealed five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in the twin father and the child, but not in the twin uncle. The SNPs were confirmed by classical Sanger sequencing. Our results give experimental evidence for the hypothesis that rare mutations will occur early after the human blastocyst has split into two, the origin of twins, and that such mutations will be carried on into somatic tissue and the germline. The method provides a solution to solve paternity and forensic cases involving monozygotic twins as alleged fathers or originators of DNA traces.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of lower respiratory tract disease and hospitalization in infants and young children. Infants of multiple births, who are often premature, might be more susceptible to developing a more severe RSV infection than singletons.\nTo assess the impact of multiple births on the severity of RSV infection and define risk factors for acquiring RSV infection in infants of multiple birth.\nClinical data on infants hospitalized with RSV infection between 2008 and 2010 were retrospectively collected.\nTwins comprised 7.6% (66/875) of hospitalized infants with RSV bronchiolitis during the study period. Infants in the twin group were younger (122.4 +/- 131.7 vs. 204.5 +/- 278.8 days, P = 0.014), had a lower mean gestational age (35.3 +/- 2.6 vs. 38.6 +/- 2.5 weeks, P < 0.001), and were more likely to have been born prematurely compared with singleton infants (65.6% vs. 13%, P < 0.001). On a multivariable logistic regression analysis, young age, early gestational age and male gender were the only variables identified as risk factors for pediatric intensive care unit admission (P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively). In contrast, the mere fact of a child being a twin was not found to be a significant risk factor for disease severity. In addition, if one twin is hospitalized due to RSV infection, the other has a 34% chance of also being hospitalized with bronchiolitis. Young age was a significant risk factor for hospitalization of the second twin (P < 0.001) CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that twins hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis do not have an increased risk for severe infection as compared to singletons. However, a twin of an infant hospitalized with RSV infection has a considerable risk of also being hospitalized with bronchiolitis, thus close monitoring is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Previous research suggests that aspects of facial surface morphology are heritable. Traditionally, heritability studies have used a limited set of linear distances to quantify facial morphology and often employ statistical methods poorly designed to deal with biological shape. In this preliminary report, we use a combination of 3D photogrammetry and landmark-based morphometrics to explore which aspects of face shape show the strongest evidence of heritability in a sample of twins.\n3D surface images were obtained from 21 twin pairs (10 monozygotic, 11 same-sex dizygotic). Thirteen 3D landmarks were collected from each facial surface and their coordinates subjected to geometric morphometric analysis. This involved superimposing the individual landmark configurations and then subjecting the resulting shape coordinates to a principal components analysis. The resulting PC scores were then used to calculate rough narrow-sense heritability estimates.\nThree principal components displayed evidence of moderate to high heritability and were associated with variation in the breadth of orbital and nasal structures, upper lip height and projection, and the vertical and forward projection of the root of the nose due to variation in the position of nasion.\nAspects of facial shape, primarily related to variation in length and breadth of central midfacial structures, were shown to demonstrate evidence of strong heritability. An improved understanding of which facial features are under strong genetic control is an important step in the identification of specific genes that underlie normal facial variation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper was to report the occurrence of peripheral blood chimerism in newborns from bigeminal pregnancies.\nCord blood collected from 50 pairs of twins constituted the biological material studied. Analyses included: DNA isolation, quantitative and qualitative assessment of DNA preparations, hybridization analysis of SLS type as well as of MLS type, and analysis of microsatellite sequences with regard to polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction.\nThe presence of additional fragments of DNA in peripheral blood lymphocytes was found in four out of fifty pairs of monozygotic twins (8%) at locus D7S21 (7p22, n = 3) and locus D12S11 (12q24.3, n = 1). In these cases, the presence of additional DNA fragments was also proved by analysis of microsatellite sequence polymorphisms at loci HUMPLA2A1 (pancreatic phospholipase A-2, 12q23), HUMCYARO (cytochrome P450, 15q21.1) and HUMvWF (von Willebrand factor, 12p13).\nThe results of our study confirm the occurrence of chimerism in twins and constitutes the starting point for further studies aimed at determining the clinical significance of chimerism in twins both for women and fetuses.",

    "abstract": "Emotional lability is recognized as an associated feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the degree of phenotypic and etiologic overlap between emotional lability and the ADHD dimensions of hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention remains unclear. The present study examines these associations in a large, community twin sample.\nStructural equation models were fit to data from 1,920 child and adolescent twin pairs (age range, 5-18 years). Symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity (HI) and inattention (IA) were assessed using a modified version of the DuPaul rating scale, completed by parents. Symptoms of emotional lability (EL) were assessed using the parent-rated Conners 10-item scale.\nThere were moderate to strong phenotypic correlations between HI, IA, and EL. Multivariate twin modeling revealed that a common pathway model best accounted for the covariance among these dimensions, represented by a highly heritable latent factor. Ad hoc analyses confirmed that all additive genetic influences on HI, IA, and EL were shared, and identified a significantly stronger association of EL with the latent ADHD factor in older than in younger individuals.\nEmotional lability was phenotypically and genetically associated with hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention in children and adolescents. The finding that a single, heritable, latent factor accounted for covariation among these phenotypes indicates that their co-occurrence is primarily the result of overlapping genetic effects. These data support the hypothesis that emotional lability is etiologically relevant to the core ADHD phenotype, and that it should be targeted in assessment and treatment in clinical practice.",

Ad hoc analyses confirmed that all additive genetic influences on HI, IA, and EL were shared, and identified a significantly stronger association of EL with the latent ADHD factor in older than in younger individuals.",

    "abstract": "Although twin gestation is well recognized to be associated with impaired fetal and postnatal growth, specific data about body composition of twins in the first month of life are scarce.\nThe aim of this study was to compare the body composition of twins, evaluated with air-displacement plethysmography, to that of singletons of similar gestational age and adequacy of growth, during the first month of life. We tested the hypothesis that the quality of growth would be similar.\nAnthropometric and air-displacement plethysmography measurements were performed in 18 pairs of twins and in 36 singleton neonates, longitudinally, from birth to the 30th day of life. Each twin was matched to a singleton infant of similar gestational age and birth weight z-score.\nWith regard to anthropometric measures, the only difference was a lower weight in twins versus singletons on the 15th day of life. With regard to body composition, we did not find any difference between groups at any time point. Fat mass increased significantly from day 1 to day 30 in both twins and singletons.\nIn terms of body composition, twins do not differ from singletons of similar gestational age and weight, either at birth or in early postnatal life.",

    "abstract": "Reduction of fetal number has been offered in high order multiple gestations but is still controversial in triplets. Since recent advances in neonatal and obstetric care have greatly improved outcome, the benefits of multifetal pregnancy reduction (MFPR) may no longer exist in triplet gestations.\nTo evaluate if fetal reduction of triplets to twins improves outcome.\nWe analyzed the outcome of 80 triplet gestations cared for at Rambam Health Care Campus in the last decade; 34 families decided to continue the pregnancy as triplets and 46 opted for MFPR to twins.\nThe mean gestational age at delivery was 32.3 weeks for triplets and 35.6 weeks for twins after MFPR. Severe prematurity (delivery before 32 gestational weeks) occurred in 37.5% and 7% of twins. Consequently, the rate of severe neonatal morbidity (respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage) and of neonatal death was significantly higher in unreduced triplets, as was the length of hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (31.4 vs. 15.7, respectively). Overall, the likelihood of a family with triplets to take home all three neonates was 80%; the likelihood to take home three healthy babies was 71.5%.\nMFPR reduces the risk of severe prematurity and the neonatal morbidity of triplets. A secondary benefit is the reduction of cost of care per survivor. Our results indicate that MFPR should be offered in triplet gestations.",

    "abstract": "The Older Australian Twins Study (OATS) is a major longitudinal study of twins, aged \u2265 65 years, to investigate genetic and environmental factors and their interactions in healthy brain ageing and neurocognitive disorders. The study collects psychiatric, neuropsychological, cardiovascular, metabolic, biochemical, neuroimaging, genomic and proteomic data, with two-yearly assessments, and is currently in its third wave. The initial cohort comprises 623 individuals (161 monozygotic and 124 dizygotic twin pairs; 1 MZ triplets; 27 single twins and 23 non-twin siblings), of whom 426 have had wave 2 assessment. A number of salient findings have emerged thus far which assist in the understanding of genetic contributions to cognitive functions such as processing speed, executive ability and episodic memory, and which support the brain reserve hypothesis. The heritability of brain structures, both cortical and subcortical, brain spectroscopic metabolites and markers of small vessel disease, such as lacunar infarction and white matter hyperintensities, have been examined and can inform future genetic investigations. Work on amyloid imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging is proceeding and epigenetic studies are progressing. This internationally important study has the potential to inform research into cognitive ageing in the future, and offers an excellent resource for collaborative work.",

    "abstract": "Several recent studies using instrumental variables based on changes in compulsory schoolleaving age laws have estimated the causal effect of schooling on health outcomes and health-related behaviors in the U.K. Despite using the same identification strategy and similar datasets, no consensus has been reached. We contribute to the literature by providing results for the U.K. using a different research design and a different dataset. Specifically, we estimate the effect of schooling on health outcomes (obesity and physical health) and health-related behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption and exercise) for women through within-MZ twins estimates using the TwinsUK database. For physical health, alcohol consumption and exercise, the within-MZ twins estimates are uninformative about whether there is a causal effect. However, we find (1) that the significant association between schooling and smoking status is due to unobserved endowments that are correlated with schooling and smoking (2) there is some indication that more schooling reduces the body mass index for women, even once these unobserved endowments have been controlled for.",

    "abstract": "The present report aimed to study an uncommon case of a pair of twins that presented a discordant dental phenotype. Family investigation, clinical, radiographic examination and molecular analysis were performed in both girls. Molecular analysis confirmed the monozygosity by deoxyribonucleic acid chip technology. One twin presented tooth agenesis in left upper lateral incisor and peg-shaped on the contra lateral side while the other twin had no dental alterations. The dental casts study employed digital caliper to compare morphological dimensions and showed alteration only in peg-shaped tooth. In conclusion, this study provide support that one or more mutated gene could cause discordances in dental phenotype in these monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "To date ten sets of monozygotic twins with neuroblastoma have been reported in the literature. Twin-to-twin in utero metastasis have been proposed as the mechanism of tumor development in the second twin; based on similar pathology, presence of metastatic disease, absence of a primary tumor, and/or later presentation in the second twin. Hereditary neuroblastoma has not been described in this context. We propose that primary neuroblastoma can occur in monozygotic twins without twin-twin transmission; due to the different ages of presentation, histology, ploidy, and tumor behavior.",

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is the most common viable chromosomal disorder with intellectual impairment and several other developmental abnormalities. Here, we report the generation and characterization of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21 in order to eliminate the effects of the variability of genomic background. The alterations observed by genetic analysis at the iPSC level and at first approximation in early development illustrate the developmental disease transcriptional signature of Down syndrome. Moreover, we observed an abnormal neural differentiation of Down syndrome iPSCs in vivo when formed teratoma in NOD-SCID mice, and in vitro when differentiated into neuroprogenitors and neurons. These defects were associated with changes in the architecture and density of neurons, astroglial and oligodendroglial cells together with misexpression of genes involved in neurogenesis, lineage specification and differentiation. Furthermore, we provide novel evidence that dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) on chromosome 21 likely contributes to these defects. Importantly, we found that targeting DYRK1A pharmacologically or by shRNA results in a considerable correction of these defects.",

    "abstract": "The inheritance of cognitive functions and personality is still a problem under investigation. A classical method, investigation of twins, is often used to find relative contributions from genetics and the environment to quantitative traits. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible influence of heredity on cognitive functions (by applying the Raven test) and personality traits (according to the Eysenck's theory) in twins.\nIn total, 139 pairs of same-sex twins were investigated. The zygosity of the twin pairs was confirmed through genotyping with 15 molecular DNA markers. Constructive thinking was assessed using the Raven test. Personality assessment was conducted using the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) in Lithuanian.\nThe difference in the total number of incorrect solutions between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs younger than 15 years was not significant; however, in the group older than 15 years, this difference was found to be significant. Based on the total number of incorrect solutions, the concordance in the MZ twins was greater than in the DZ twins. The same tendency was found with cumulative EPQ scores on the extraversion scale.\nThe results imply that the quality of cognitive functions and personality traits (extraversion) can be influenced by heredity. This confirms previous findings on the heritability of cognitive factors and personality traits.",

    "abstract": "It has been postulated that androgen overexposure in a susceptible person leads to excessive brain masculinization and the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype. In this study, the responses to estradiol (E2), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) on B-lymphocytes from ASD subjects and controls are compared. B cells were obtained from 11 ASD subjects, their unaffected fraternal twins, and nontwin siblings. Controls were obtained from a different cell bank. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and sodium 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) reduction levels were measured after incubation with different concentrations of E2, DHT, and DDE. XTT/LDH ratio, representative of mitochondria number per cell, was calculated. E2, DHT, and DDE all cause \"U\"-shaped growth curves, as measured by LDH levels. ASD B cells show less growth depression compared to siblings and controls (P < 0.01). They also have reduced XTT/LDH ratios (P < 0.01) when compared to external controls, whereas siblings had values of XTT/LDH between ASD and external controls. B-lymphocytes from people with ASD exhibit a differential response to E2, DHT, and hormone disruptors in regard to cell growth and mitochondrial upregulation when compared to non-ASD siblings and external controls. Specifically, ASD B-lymphocytes show significantly less growth depression and less mitochondrial upregulation when exposed to these effectors. A mitochondrial deficit in ASD individuals is implied.",

    "abstract": "About 13% of twins are born before 34 weeks and 7% before 32 weeks. The prediction of preterm birth in twins is based on the same tests as in singleton pregnancies. In twin pregnancies, the cut-off for short cervix at the second trimester scan is less than 25 mm (compared with 15 mm in singletons); length less than 20 mm is associated with 42% risk for birth before 32 weeks and cervical length less than 25 mm is associated with 28% risk for birth before 28 weeks. The measurement of cervical length in pregnancies with symptoms of preterm labour may have limited accuracy in predicting preterm birth. In asymptomatic women, a positive fetal fibronectin test seems to be associated with 35% risk for birth before 32 weeks and 40% risk for birth less than 34 weeks, whereas a negative test decreases the risk to 6% and 17%, respectively. The differences in the predictive value of tests between twins and singletons reflect the diverse pathophysiology of preterm birth between the two groups.",

    "abstract": "Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are both disorders of the immune system; however, they are known as distinct diseases. Till now no clinical evidence suggests the genetic relationship between these two diseases. Herein, we present two identical twins; one was diagnosed as anti-GBM glomerulonephritis, the other SLE. This is the first clinical report on the genetic relationship between these two diseases.\nA 25-year-old female was admitted complaining of intermittent gross hematuria for 6 months and elevated serum creatinine for 1 month. She denied hemoptysis. Laboratory examinations showed hemoglobin 7.4 g/dL, serum creatinine 7.15 mg/dL and albumin 2.8 g/dL. Urinalysis showed hematuria (484 RBCs per high-power field) and proteinuria 4+. Antinuclear antibody, complement levels and ANCAs were all normal. Renal ultrasound showed normal-sized kidneys without obstruction or masses. Serum anti-GBM antibody assay showed 119.70 RU/mL (normal range, <20 RU/mL). Chest X-ray was normal. She was diagnosed as anti-GBM glomerulonephritis and received plasma exchange (2000-3000 ml plasma/exchange, 5 turns), methylprednisolone 0.5 g for three days, plus cyclophosphamide. Although serum anti-GBM antibodies decreased gradually to a normal range, her renal function did not improve. One month later, her identical twin sister was diagnosed as SLE based on malar erythema, arthralgia, antinuclear antibody positive with liter 1:1000, and Anti-Smith (Sm) antibody ++. Anti-GBM antibody and complements were within normal ranges. Further study showed these twins were HLA-DRB1*1501 homozygotes.\nThe presence of identical twins having anti-GBM nephritis and SLE respectively provides clinical evidence to support that anti-GBM nephritis and lupus may share a common genetic background to some extent, while environment may contribute to disease evolution in part.",

    "abstract": "Submicroscopic deletion of 10p15.3 is a rare genetic disorder, currently reported in 21 unrelated patients. It is mainly associated with cognitive deficits, speech disorders, motor delay and hypotonia. The size of the deleted region ranges between 0.15 and 4 Mb and does not generally correlate with phenotype. A monozygotic female twin pair with a de novo 2.7 Mb deletion of 10p15.3 is herein reported. The girls presented at the age of 8 months with severe developmental delay and failure to thrive since the first month of life. Their perinatal and family history was unremarkable. On admission they both exhibited generalized dystonia, microcephaly, complete absence of voluntary movements and visual/auditory unresponsiveness. Their brain MRIs demonstrated dilatation of ventricles, subarachnoid spaces and anterior interhemispheric fissure and sylvian fissures bilaterally. Cranial radiography revealed partial fusion of both coronal sutures. Visual and brainstem auditory evoked potentials were markedly abnormal, indicating severe visual and sensorineural hearing impairment. The electroencephalogram, as well as a screening for inborn errors of metabolism, were unremarkable. Both patients required gastrostomy and tracheostomy before the age of 1 year. They were, additionally, managed with physical therapy, as well as baclofen and low-dose haloperidol. Their current state at the age of 2 years is relatively stable. The index patients' phenotype includes features, such as dystonic cerebral palsy, visual and sensorineural hearing impairment or craniosynostosis, which have not been previously reported in individuals with 10p15.3 deletion. It is necessary to consider these novel clinical features and investigate their possible relationship with the recently recognized syndrome.",

The combined effect of idiochromosome loss due to an anaphase lag and the relocation of discordant blastomeres may trigger the twinning procedure and discordance of Turner syndrome. We present 2 cases of MZ twins discordant for Turner syndrome that were diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound and cytogenetic studies (one fetus was 45,X and the other 46,XX). Both cases, which involved monochorionic (MC) diamniotic twins, underwent selective feticide and had favorable outcomes for the remaining twin. Ultrasound, amniocentesis of both sacs (dual amniocentesis) and zygosity determination are indispensable in diagnosing heterokaryotypia. Selective feticide is a treatment option in cases of heterokaryotypic MC diamniotic twins, and in our cases, it resulted in favorable outcomes for the remaining twin.",

    "abstract": "The majority of the congenital anomalies of middle ear are solitary and a non-hereditary. We report cases of identical twins with congenital incudo-stapedial disconnection. Case 1 was an 8-year-old girl. Hearing impairment was identified at the age of three. She was referred to our university hospital in April 2005. Pure-tone audiogram showed conductive hearing impairments. Computed tomography (CT) revealed the incudo-stapedial disconnections in both ears. The exploratory tympanotomies on the right and left ears were performed in May and July 2005, respectively. The surgical findings showed absence of the long process and presence of the lenticular process of the incus in both ears. After the reconstructions of ossicular chain, the hearing of both ears improved. Case 2 was an 11-year-old girl. The hearing impairment of the right ear was identified in May 2008. She was referred to our university hospital three months later. Pure-tone audiogram showed the conductive hearing impairment in the right ear. CT revealed the incudo-stapedial disconnection in the right ear. The surgery showed the same findings as those of case 1. Anomalies of both cases suggest that the lenticular process of the incus and the stapes originate from a common primordium.",

    "abstract": "To summarize our experience in the anesthetic management of conjoined twins undergoing one-stage surgical separation.\nMedical records of conjoined twins admitted to our hospital for treatment and considered for surgical separation from 1996 to present were retrospectively reviewed. Four cases of conjoined twins underwent one-stage surgical separation under general anesthesia. Preoperative evaluation was performed to determine the extent of anatomical conjunction and associated anomalies. Anesthesia was simultaneously induced in all conjoined twins. The intubation procedure was successfully performed with the head slightly rotated to each baby's side, followed by the administration of vecuronium. Anesthetic agents were administered according to the estimated weight of each baby. One case of conjoined twins underwent surgical separation with cardiopulmonary bypass due to shared hearts. Results : All conjoined twins were successfully separated. No significant respiratory or cardiac events occurred during surgery except for one twin, which died after separation because of complicated congenital heart disease. Conclusions : Accurate preoperative evaluation, respiratory and circulatory management, and close cooperation of the multidisciplinary team are important aspects of anesthetic management of conjoined twins surgery.",

    "abstract": "Two sets of monozygotic (MZ) twins with Kawasaki disease (KD) from two different families are reported. Twin set 1, previously healthy 71-day-old MZ twin girls were diagnosed with incomplete KD and pneumonia. The symptoms occurred at the same time in both girls. Both girls had ectasia of right coronary arteries. In twin set 2, the younger of 18-month-old MZ twin boys was diagnosed with KD and bronchitis. After 53 days, his elder brother was diagnosed with the same disease. The symptoms occurred at different time, but were almost identical. Neither boy displayed coronary artery changes. These findings support the hypothesis that genes susceptible to KD and coronary-artery lesions may exist in families. The different clinical characteristics among MZ twins from different families also suggest diverse and complex nature of KD.",

    "abstract": "Plastic bronchitis is an extremely rare disease characterized by the formation of tracheobronchial airway casts, which are composed of a fibrinous exudate with rubber-like consistency and cause respiratory distress as a result of severe airflow obstruction. Bronchial casts may be associated with congenital and acquired cardiopathies, bronchopulmonary diseases leading to mucus hypersecretion, and pulmonary lymphatic abnormalities. In recent years, however, there is growing evidence that plastic bronchitis can also be triggered by common respiratory tract infections and thereby cause atelectasis even in otherwise healthy children.\nWe report on 22-month-old monozygotic twins presenting with atelectasis triggered by a simple respiratory tract infection. The clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings given, bronchial cast formation was suspected in both infants but could only be confirmed after bronchoscopy in the first case. Real-time polymerase chain reaction of the removed cast as well as nasal lavage fluid of both infants demonstrated strong positivity for human bocavirus.\nOur case report is the first to describe two simultaneously affected monozygotic twins and substantiates the hypothesis of a contributing genetic factor in the pathophysiology of this disease. In this second report related to human bocavirus, we show additional evidence that this condition can be triggered by a simple respiratory tract infection in previously healthy infants.",

    "abstract": "Twin registries around the globe have collected DNA samples from large numbers of monozygotic and dizygotic twins. The twin sample collections are frequently used as controls in disease-specific studies together with non-twins. This approach is unbiased under the hypothesis that twins and singletons are comparable in terms of allele frequencies; i.e. there are no genetic variants associated with being a twin per se. To test this hypothesis we performed a genome-wide association study comparing the allele frequency of 572,352 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1,413 monozygotic (MZ) and 5,451 dizygotic (DZ) twins with 3,720 healthy singletons. Twins and singletons have been genotyped using the same platform. SNPs showing association with being a twin at P-value < 1 \u00d7 10(-5) were selected for replication analysis in 1,492 twins (463 MZ and 1,029 DZ) and 1,880 singletons from Finland. No SNPs reached genome-wide significance (P-value < 5 \u00d7 10(-8)) in the main analysis combining MZ and DZ twins. In a secondary analysis including only DZ twins two SNPs (rs2033541 close to ADAMTSL1 and rs4149283 close to ABCA1)\u00a0were genome-wide significant after meta-analysis with the Finnish population. The estimated proportion of variance on the liability scale explained by all SNPs was 0.08 (P-value=0.003) when MZ and DZ were considered together and smaller for MZ (0.06, P-value=0.10) compared to DZ (0.09, P-value=0.003) when analyzed separately. In conclusion, twins and singletons can be used in genetic studies together with general population samples without introducing large bias. Further research is needed to explore genetic variances associated with DZ twinning.",

    "abstract": "A twin pair affected by juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) with the same somatic PTPN11 mutation and abnormal chromosome 7 in bone marrow samples but distinct prognostic gene expression signatures, received a matched-unrelated donor and matched-unrelated cord blood transplant, respectively. Both twins fully engrafted, but after 6\u00a0months, the twin with an acute-myeloid-like (AML-like) signature at diagnosis rejected the graft and had an autologous reconstitution. A second transplant with an unrelated 5/6-HLA-matched-loci cord blood performed after 4\u00a0months from rejection was unsuccessful. After 25\u00a0months from diagnosis, the twin with the AML-like gene expression signature died of liver failure while on progression of his JMML. The other twin, who had a non-acute-myeloid-like (non-AML-like) gene expression signature at diagnosis is in complete hematological remission with full donor chimera. This observation suggests a biological diversity of JMML also in patients with a common genetic background.",

    "abstract": "Schizoaffective disorder (SAD) represents one of the most confusing and controversial concepts in psychiatry. Prevalence is less than 1%, but despite that it has a major influence on an individual and community. There is an increased risk for schizophrenia and mood diorders in first degree relatives with SAD, according to DSM IV. This paper describes the concordant clinical response of a pair of monozygotic twins with SAD when treated with risperidon and valproic acid. We found that their clinical symptoms were very similar and both brothers expressed hipomanic and depressive episode prior to full onset of SAD-psychotic symptoms with correlations of elevated mood, and first psychiatric hospitalization at the age of 19 (patient A) and 18 (patient B). Their response to the combined treatment with risperidon and valproic acid has been also similar both in intensity and in the pattern of symptoms that have improved.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the relationship between twin language, twins' close ties, and social competence in a prospective longitudinal study. We hypothesized that twins whose tie is close would be more likely to develop a twin language, and these twins would be less likely to develop social competence. In addition, we hypothesize that some environmental factors, such as having an older sibling, preschool attendance, zygosity, and sex are also related to twin language, twins' close ties, and social competence. At baseline in 1999 a mailed questionnaire survey was conducted, and a follow-up questionnaire was distributed in 2004 among 958 mothers. As a result, 516 respondents returned the questionnaire (53.9%). In this study, we used 261 twin pairs aged from 6 to 12 years (school-age children) for analysis, excluding those with missing values. In the present study, we found that zygosity and sex were associated with twins' close ties. Having an older sibling and preschool attendance did not affect the twins' close tie, twin language, or social competence. One of the most important findings was that social competence was not affected directly by twins' close tie, but was affected when a twin language was found.",

    "abstract": "To assess the outcome of monochorionic diamniotic (MD) twins with the aid of the MD-twin score.\nWe enrolled 112 MD-twin women in a tertiary perinatal center from 1997 to 2009. The MD-twin score was prospectively applied once per week to women who did not have twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) after 26 weeks of gestation. The MD-twin score consists of five variables: (i) fetal weight discordance; (ii) amniotic fluid discordance; (iii) hydrops fetalis; (iv) umbilical cord insertion; and (v) fetal heart rate monitoring. Normal was assigned a value of 0, abnormal was assigned 1, and total score was used for evaluation. Women with scores of 2 at 26 weeks gestation were managed expectantly until the score reached 3. Outcome measures were fetal death, neonatal death and neurological sequelae. The incidence of poor outcome according to score was investigated. The characteristics of MD twins with poor outcome were investigated.\nMD-twin scores were applied to 90 women. Among them, 79 had scores of 2 or less and all had good outcomes. There were 11 women with a score of 3, four of whom had adverse outcome for at least one twin. Neonates born to women with scores of 0-2 had good outcomes without respect to birthweight percentile, while neonates with scores of 3 had poor outcomes when their birthweight percentile was less than the third percentile.\nThe MD-twin score is applicable to 90% of MD twins without TTTS. An MD-twin score of 2 is reassuring, while a score of 3 indicates increased risks for adverse outcome.",

    "abstract": "To assess the relationship of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with health functioning and disability in Vietnam-era Veterans.\nA cross-sectional study of functioning and disability in male Vietnam-era Veteran twins. PTSD was measured by the\u00a0Composite International Diagnostic Interview; health functioning and disability were assessed using the Veterans RAND 36-Item Health Survey (VR-36) and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0). All data collection took place between 2010 and 2012.\nAverage age of the 5,574 participating Veterans (2,102 Vietnam theater and 3,472 non-theater) was 61.0\u00a0years. Veterans with PTSD had poorer health functioning across all domains of VR-36 and increased disability for all subscales of WHODAS 2.0 (all p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) compared with Veterans without PTSD. Veterans with PTSD were in poorer overall health on the VR-36 physical composite summary (PCS) (effect size\u00a0=\u00a00.31 in theater and 0.47 in non-theater Veterans; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001 for both) and mental composite summary (MCS) (effect size\u00a0=\u00a00.99 in theater and 0.78 in non-theater Veterans; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001 for both) and had increased disability on the WHODAS 2.0 summary score (effect size\u00a0=\u00a01.02 in theater and 0.96 in non-theater Veterans; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001 for both). Combat exposure, independent of PTSD status, was associated with lower PCS and MCS scores and increased disability (all p\u00a0<\u00a0.05, for trend). Within-pair analyses in twins discordant for PTSD produced consistent findings.\nVietnam-era Veterans with PTSD have diminished functioning and increased disability. The poor functional status of aging combat-exposed Veterans is of particular concern.",

    "abstract": "Angelman syndrome (AS, OMIM105830) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by different genetic mechanisms. Determining the genetic mechanism is essential to establish the recurrence risk and the accuracy of genetic/reproductive counseling. The majority of AS patients present with a deletion of the 15q11.2-q13 region on the maternally derived chromosome. The other genetic mechanisms are: paternal disomy of chromosome 15, imprinting center defects, and mutations in the ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A gene (UBE3A). Different recurrence risks are associated with each specific genetic mechanism involved. We report on the study of dizygotic twins with classic phenotypic AS due to deletion of the same maternally derived chromosome 15. The mother presented with hypopigmented macular lesions on the inner side of both arms. Fibroblast culture studies of the maternal hypopigmented skin areas from both arms showed mosaicism for a normal cell line and for a second cell line with a 15q11.2-q13 deletion. This family represents the first demonstrated case of maternal somatic and germ line mosaicism for 15q11.2-q13 deletion as the cause of AS.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this case report was to describe oral findings and outline challenges and considerations for general anesthetic (GA) and dental management of 4-year-old female craniopagus (cranially conjoined) twins, at high risk for medical comorbidity, who presented for treatment of severe early childhood caries. This hospital-based procedure required good interdisciplinary communication, cooperation, and presurgical planning to address unique challenges and ensure positive postoperative outcomes. Two separate anesthesia teams delivered GA simultaneously to each twin. To minimize anesthetic exposure, two pediatric dental teams completed dental care concurrently. Extensive plaque accumulation and unusual \"mirror-image\" caries distribution were attributed to frequency and postural pooling during feeding. The rehabilitation objective was to provide definitive dental management, minimizing future need for dental retreatment under GA. Two-month follow-up revealed intact dental restorations, good oral hygiene, and weight gain. For these unique twins however, the challenge of long-term oral health maintenance remains.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the role of genetic and environmental factors in the development of anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and ACPA-positive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a twin cohort.\nA total of 12\u2005590 twins were analysed for the presence of ACPAs (CCP2 ELISA), HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) gene alleles, and exposure to smoking. Twins with established RA were identified in national public care registers. Antibody reactivities against citrullinated and native forms of \u03b1-enolase, vimentin, fibrinogen and type II collagen peptides were tested by ELISA in anti-CCP2-positive subjects and their cotwins. Structural equation models and ORs for the development of ACPA and ACPA-positive RA were computed for smokers and SE carriers.\nA total of 2.8% (350/12\u2005590) of the twins were ACPA positive, and 1.0% (124/12\u2005590) had ACPA-positive RA. Most of the variability in the ACPA status was accounted for by non-shared environmental or stochastic factors (78%, 95% CI 55% to 100%) rather than shared environmental and genetic factors. Analysis of specific risk factors revealed an association between smoking and SE and the presence of ACPAs. Twins with ACPA-positive RA were more frequently SE positive than twins with ACPAs without RA. Reactivities against multiple citrullinated peptides were present in most twins with ACPA-positive RA but in fewer twins with ACPAs without RA.\nEnvironment, lifestyle and stochastic factors may be more important than genetics in determining which individuals develop ACPAs. Genetic factors (particularly SE) may have a relatively larger role in determining which ACPA-positive individuals will ultimately develop arthritis.",

    "abstract": "Although many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) experience difficulties with anxiety,the manifestation of these difficulties remains unresolved. The current study assessed anxiety in a large population based twin sample, aged 10\u201315 years. Phenotypic analyses were used to explore anxiety symptoms in children with ASDs, their unaffected co-twins and a control sample.\nParticipants included 146 families from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) where one or both children had a suspected ASD. Eighty control families were also included. The Revised Child Anxiety and Depression scale (Chorpita, Yim, Moffitt, Umemoto & Francis, 2000) was completed (self- and parent-report), along with diagnostic and cognitive tests. Children were categorized into four groups (a) ASD (b) Broader Autism Phenotype (BAP: mainly co-twins of children with ASDs, with high subclinical autistic traits) (c) unaffected co-twins (with neither ASDs nor BAP) (d) controls.\nChildren in the ASD and BAP groups scored significantly higher than controls for all parent-rated (although not child-rated) anxiety subscales.There were no significant differences between the ASD and BAP groups for any of the parent-rated anxiety subscales. Compared with controls, unaffected co-twins showed significantly heightened Social Anxiety, Generalized Anxiety,and Panic symptoms. Significant associations were observed between certain anxiety subscales and both IQ and ASD symptoms. For example, greater parent-rated Social Anxiety was associated with higher IQ and increased social and communicative impairments. Significant interrater correlations were observed for anxiety reports in children with ASDs (r = .27\u2013.54; p < .01), their unaffected co-twins (r = .32\u2013.63; p < .01) and controls (r = .23\u2013.43; p < .01)suggesting that children in this sample with and without ASD symptoms were able to report on their anxiety symptoms with some accuracy.\nThese findings support previous reports of heightened anxiety in children with ASDs, at least on parent-reported measures. Unaffected co-twins of children with ASDs also showed increased anxiety, generating questions about the potential etiological overlap between ASDs and anxiety. Progress in this area now depends on more refined anxiety measurement in ASDs and continued investigation of interrater differences.",

Significant associations were observed between certain anxiety subscales and both IQ and ASD symptoms. For example, greater parent-rated Social Anxiety was associated with higher IQ and increased social and communicative impairments. Significant interrater correlations were observed for anxiety reports in children with ASDs (r = .27\u2013.54; p < .01), their unaffected co-twins (r = .32\u2013.63; p < .01) and controls (r = .23\u2013.43; p < .01)suggesting that children in this sample with and without ASD symptoms were able to report on their anxiety symptoms with some accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In colorectal cancer, increased expression of the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been shown to provoke metastatic disease due to the interaction with its ligand stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). Recently, a second SDF-1 receptor, CXCR7, was found to enhance tumor growth in solid tumors. Albeit signaling cascades via SDF-1/CXCR4 have been intensively studied, the significance of the SDF-1/CXCR7-induced intracellular communication triggering malignancy is still only marginally understood.\nIn tumor tissue of 52 patients with colorectal cancer, we observed that expression of CXCR7 and CXCR4 increased with tumor stage and tumor size. Asking whether activation of CXCR4 or CXCR7 might result in a similar expression pattern, we performed microarray expression analyses using lentivirally CXCR4- and/or CXCR7-overexpressing SW480 colon cancer cell lines with and without stimulation by SDF-1\u03b1.\nGene regulation via SDF-1\u03b1/CXCR4 and SDF-1\u03b1/CXCR7 was completely different and partly antidromic. Differentially regulated genes were assigned by gene ontology to migration, proliferation, and lipid metabolic processes. Expressions of AKR1C3, AXL, C5, IGFBP7, IL24, RRAS, and TNNC1 were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Using the in silico gene set enrichment analysis, we showed that expressions of miR-217 and miR-218 were increased in CXCR4 and reduced in CXCR7 cells after stimulation with SDF-1\u03b1. Functionally, exposure to SDF-1\u03b1 increased invasiveness of CXCR4 and CXCR7 cells, AXL knockdown hampered invasion. Compared with controls, CXCR4 cells showed increased sensitivity against 5-FU, whereas CXCR7 cells were more chemoresistant.\nThese opposing results for CXCR4- or CXCR7-overexpressing colon carcinoma cells demand an unexpected attention in the clinical application of chemokine receptor antagonists such as plerixafor.",

The advent of specific laboratory tests has refined the identification of genetic traits. In this case report, we describe the occurrence of pulmonary embolism in young twins. Intensive tumour screening remained unremarkable. Evaluation of established risk factors for a clotting disorder remained negative, with the exception of a plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 4G/5G polymorphism. Despite the mild association accompanied by the presence of the 4G allele, this polymorphism might predispose to venous thromboembolism in some cases in general and in our case in particular.",

    "abstract": "The relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to brain structure change throughout the lifespan. Brain structures have been reported to be highly heritable in middle-aged individuals and younger; however, the influence of genes on brain structure is less studied in older adults. We performed a magnetic resonance imaging study of 236 older twins, with a mean age of 71.4 \u00b1 5.7 years, to examine the heritability of 53 brain global and lobar volumetric measures. Total brain volume (63%) and other volumetric measures were moderately to highly heritable in late life, and these genetic influences tended to decrease with age, suggesting a greater influence of environmental factors as age advanced. Genetic influences were higher in men and on the left hemisphere compared with the right. In multivariate models, common genetic factors were observed for global and lobar total and gray matter volumes. This study examined the genetic contribution to 53 brain global and lobar volumetric measures in older twins for the first time, and the influence of age, sex, and laterality on these genetic contributions, which are useful information for a better understanding of the process of brain aging and helping individuals to have a healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Most, but not all, studies report a positive association between birth weight, as an indirect marker of prenatal hormone exposure, and offspring breast cancer risk, particularly premenopausal breast cancer. Females from opposite-sexed twin pairs may also be prenatally exposed to androgens from their twin brothers. A Swedish study of opposite-sexed twins with a small sample size found a very strong positive association between female birth weight and breast cancer risk. In this case-control study, nested within a cohort of female opposite-sexed twins, we included 543 breast cancer case subjects diagnosed in the period from 1972 to 2008 and 2715 matched control subjects. Conditional logistic regression estimated the breast cancer risk associated with birth weight and other birth characteristics, including gestational age and co-twin birth weight. All statistical tests were two-sided. There was no association between birth weight (odds ratio = 1.01; 95% confidence interval = 0.70 to 1.46) or twin brother's birth weight and risk of breast cancer, which suggests the previously reported strong positive association may have been a chance finding.",

A total of 8582 monozygotic (MZ) and 15 788 dizygotic same sex (DZSS) twins were included.\nNumber of prescription fillings during follow-up (1995-2005) was analysed according to education and income. Results of unpaired and intrapair analyses were compared.\nAn inverse social gradient in filling of prescriptions for all-purpose and system-specific drugs was observed in the unpaired analyses. In the intrapair analyses, associations were attenuated some in DZSS and more in MZ twins. Filling of drugs targeting the nervous system was still strongly associated with income in the intrapair analyses.\nFamilial factors seem to account for part of the observed social inequality in filling of prescription medicine.",

    "abstract": "Congenital chloride diarrhea (CLD) is a rare inherited autosomal recessive disorder. Mutations of the solute carrier family 26 member 3 gene cause profuse, chloride ion rich diarrhea, which results in hypochloremia, hyponatremia and metabolic alkalosis with dehydration. If a fetal ultrasound shows bowel dilatation suggestive of bowel obstruction, or if a neonate shows persistent diarrhea and metabolic alkalosis, CLD should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The severity of CLD varies, but early detection and early therapy can prevent complications including growth failure. We report a case of dizygotic twins affected by CLD who had been born to non-consanguineous parents. Both of them showed growth failure, but one of the twins experienced worse clinical course. He showed developmental delay, along with dehydration and severe electrolyte imbalance. He was diagnosed with CLD first at 6-month age, and then the other one was also diagnosed with CLD.",

    "abstract": "Male sex is a risk factor for pre-term birth (PTB) among singleton pregnancies; however, in twin pregnancies, the effect of sex on PTB is not yet clear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of twin's sex on risk of PTB. During this analytical cross-sectional study, we evaluated the effect of twin's sex, chorionicity and other factors on risk of PTB in 676 pregnant women in a university hospital in Tehran, Iran. Existence of male gender in pregnancy was a risk factor for PTB. Comparing same sex twins together, male-male gender was a risk factor for PTB (OR = 1.67 (1.19-2.34), p = 0.002), early PTB (OR = 1.18 (1.04-1.34), p = 0.01) and very early PTB (OR = 1.06 (1-1.13), p = 0.04). Monoamnion twins were at higher risk for early PTB (OR = 1.44 (1.08-1.92), p = 0.02), and very early PTB (OR = 1.95 (1.1-3.44), p = 0.03) but the risk did not increase in monochorion twins. History of abortion was also shown to be a risk factor (p < 0.05). Maternal age, multiparity, body mass index (BMI) and assisted reproductive techniques (ART) did not reach the significance levels to be considered as risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) shows \u223c40% concordance rate in monozygotic twins (MZ) suggesting a role for environmental factors and/or epigenetic modifications in the etiology of the disease. The aim of our study was to dissect the contribution of epigenetic factors, particularly, DNA methylation (DNAm), to the incomplete penetrance of T1D. We performed DNAm profiling in lymphocyte cell lines from 3 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for T1D and 6 MZ twin pairs concordant for the disease using HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. This assay assesses the methylation state of 27,578 CpG sites, mostly located within proximal promoter regions. We identified 88 CpG sites displaying significant methylation changes in all T1D-discordant MZ twin pairs. Functional annotation of the genes with distinct CpG methylation profiles in T1D samples showed differential DNAm of immune response and defense response pathways between affected and unaffected twins. Integration of DNAm data with GWAS data mapped several known T1D associated genes, HLA, INS, IL-2RB, CD226, which showed significant differences in DNAm between affected and unaffected of twins. Our findings suggest that abnormalities of DNA methylation patterns, known to regulate gene transcription, may be involved in the pathogenesis of T1D.",

    "abstract": "This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate single and additive effects of health behaviours for risk of future disability pension (DP) due to musculoskeletal diagnoses, DP due to mental diagnoses, DP due to circulatory system diagnoses or DP due to other diagnoses. A secondary aim was to evaluate the role of familial confounding in these associations.\nA sample of 31,206 Swedish twin individuals was followed from 1998-2003 to the end of 2008 via national registries for DP supplemented with additional baseline questionnaire data. Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated.\nThe single effect of moderate to heavy alcohol consumption was associated with decreased risk of DP irrespective of diagnosis group in analyses accounting for background and familial factors (HR 0.42-0.88). Low frequency of physical activity (HR 1.17-1.63) or being past or regular user of tobacco products (HR 1.38-3.49) predicted increased risk for DP in all diagnosis groups. Interactions between physical activity and alcohol or tobacco consumption were significant for DP due to musculoskeletal diagnoses and mental diagnoses.\nHealth behaviours are important risk factors for DP irrespective of diagnosis groups. The effect of health behaviours is independent from familial effects (genetics and shared environment) pointing to a direct effect of health behaviours on DP, but education, body mass index, number and severity of diseases and marital status may confound the associations. The complex interrelationships between the health behaviours revealed by interactions suggest that prevention of future DP should attempt to influence these co-existent behaviours.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to provide a critical analysis of the impact of assisted conception on prenatal screening for Down syndrome (DS) in twin pregnancies and the value of various screening modalities for early detection of anomalies.\nThe literature was searched using PubMed and the Cochrane Library focusing on prenatal screening and antenatal care of assisted-conception twin pregnancies.\nSerum screening alone is of limited value in detecting aneuploid twins, because the unaffected cotwin can \"mask\" the abnormal serum results of an affected one. In addition, this test can designate the pregnancy as at high risk but not identify the affected fetus. Nuchal translucency (NT) screening is the best available modality and a highly effective screening method for twin pregnancies. Among twins, NT alone has a 69% DS detection rate, first-trimester combined NT and serum biochemistry has a 72% DS detection rate, and an integrated screen will have an 80% DS detection rate at a 5% FPR. The data in the literature concerning the effect of assisted conception on maternal serum screening markers in twin pregnancies are scarce.\nDown syndrome screening in assisted-conception twins presents clinical and technical challenges. Therefore, assisted-conception twins need close monitoring from conception to delivery, by a practitioner familiar with the available screening modalities and their relative accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation play a key role in gene regulation and disease susceptibility. However, little is known about the genome-wide frequency, localization, and function of methylation variation and how it is regulated by genetic and environmental factors. We utilized the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource (MuTHER) and generated Illumina 450K adipose methylome data from 648 twins. We found that individual CpGs had low variance and that variability was suppressed in promoters. We noted that DNA methylation variation was highly heritable (h(2)median = 0.34) and that shared environmental effects correlated with metabolic phenotype-associated CpGs. Analysis of methylation quantitative-trait loci (metQTL) revealed that 28% of CpGs were associated with nearby SNPs, and when overlapping them with adipose expression quantitative-trait loci (eQTL) from the same individuals, we found that 6% of the loci played a role in regulating both gene expression and DNA methylation. These associations were bidirectional, but there were pronounced negative associations for promoter CpGs. Integration of metQTL with adipose reference epigenomes and disease associations revealed significant enrichment of metQTL overlapping metabolic-trait or disease loci in enhancers (the strongest effects were for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and body mass index [BMI]). We followed up with the BMI SNP rs713586, a cg01884057 metQTL that overlaps an enhancer upstream of ADCY3, and used bisulphite sequencing to refine this region. Our results showed widespread population invariability yet sequence dependence on adipose DNA methylation but that incorporating maps of regulatory elements aid in linking CpG variation to gene regulation and disease risk in a tissue-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Fumarase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism of the Krebs Tricarboxylic Acid cycle. A heavy neurological disease burden is imparted by fumarase deficiency, commonly manifesting as microcephaly, dystonia, global developmental delay, seizures, and lethality in the infantile period. Heterozygous carriers also carry an increased risk of developing hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma. We describe a non-consanguineous family in whom a dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy resulted in twin boys with fumarase deficiency proven at the biochemical, enzymatic, and molecular levels. Their clinical phenotype included hepatic involvement. A novel mutation in the fumarate hydratase gene was identified in this family.",

Physiological parameters are assumed to be very similar in MZ twin pairs in contrast to DZ twin pairs or unrelated speakers, and it is hypothesized that the speaker specific shape of articulatory looping trajectories of the tongue is at least partly dependent on biomechanical properties and the speaker's individual physiology. By means of electromagnetic articulography (EMA), inter-speaker variability in the looping trajectories of the tongue back during /VCV/ sequences is analyzed. Results reveal similar looping patterns within MZ twin pairs but in DZ pairs differences in the shape of the loop, the direction of the upward and downward movement, and the amount of horizontal sliding movement at the palate are found.",

    "abstract": "To examine the role of genetic and environmental factors on sleep behavior in 12-year-old twins matched for family environment.\nPopulation-based twin cohort.\nParticipants were assessed in their home environment.\nOne hundred thirty-two adolescent twins comprising 25 monozygotic (MZ) and 41 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs; aged 12.2 \u00b1 0.1 y (mean \u00b1 standard deviation).\nN/A.\nFor 2 weeks in their home environment, participants wore a wrist activity monitor and completed a daily sleep diary. Sleep diaries included reports of bedtime, wake time, and estimated sleep onset time. Mean timing, duration, and quality of sleep during the 2 weeks were calculated for each individual and compared within twin pairs. MZ twin correlations were higher than the DZ correlations for total sleep time (MZr = 0.64; DZr = 0.38) and sleep onset latency (MZr = 0.83; DZr = 0.53) and significantly higher for wake after sleep onset (MZr = 0.66; DZr = 0.04) and sleep efficiency (MZr = 0.82; DZr = 0.10). Univariate modeling showed additive genetic factors accounted for 65% of the variance in total sleep time, 83% in sleep onset latency, and 52% and 57% of the variance in wake after sleep onset and sleep efficiency, respectively. A predominant influence of shared environment was found on the timing of sleep (67% for sleep start time, 86% for sleep end time).\nThere is a strong genetic influence on the sleep-wake patterns of 12-year-old adolescents. Genes have a greater influence on sleep initiation and sleep maintenance and a smaller role in sleep timing, likely to be influenced by family environment.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this review is to assess the evidence that supports the use of ultrasound in twin pregnancies. Although many of the indications for obstetric ultrasound are the same in both singleton and multiple gestations, there are special considerations as well as unique conditions in twins that require additional imaging studies. The reasons for ultrasound in twins include pregnancy dating, determination of chorionicity, nuchal translucency assessment, anatomical survey, placental evaluation, cervical length assessment, routine fetal growth, and serial surveillance of pregnancies complicated by anomalies, cervical shortening, fetal growth disturbances, and amniotic fluid abnormalities. Twins with monochorionic placentation require heightened scrutiny for monoamnionicity, conjoined twins, twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) syndrome, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, unequal placental sharing with discordant twin growth or selective intrauterine fetal growth restriction (IUGR), twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS), and single fetal demise. Ultrasound is essential for the detection and management of conditions that can complicate dichorionic and monochorionic twin pregnancies.",

We counted the frequencies of all ART liveborn twins among all liveborn infants and among all liveborn twins and frequencies in the subgroup of very preterm births.\nDuring the period 1987-2010, there were 13,293 twins (2.73%, range 1.93-3.62%, a nearly 2-fold increase from 1987 to 2010), 6939 infants born after ART (1.42%, range 0.03-2.62%, an 87-fold increase from 1987 to 2010), including 2317 (33.4%, range 14.28-44.83%, a 3-fold increase from 1987 to 2010) twins (0.47% of all deliveries). A total of 425 twin infants (0.99%, range: 1.07-1.2%, insignificant increase) were born at <32 weeks' gestation, including 261 after ART (61.4%, range 20-100%, 5-fold increase). Twins after ART born at <32 weeks comprised 0.05% of all births (range 0.004-0.11%) and increased 27-fold from 1987 to 2010.\nThe incidence of twins after ART born at <32 weeks increased 27-fold from 1987 to 2010 and has not reduced from its peak incidence over the last decade.",

    "abstract": "Chronological age, dental development, height and weight measurements, sexual maturation characteristics and skeletal age are some biological indicators that have been used to identify time of growth. Many researchers have agreed that skeletal maturity is closely related to the craniofacial growth, and bones of hand and wrist are reliable parameters in assessing it. The complete hand and wrist radiograph involves 30 bones and assessment of these bones is one elaborate task. The present study is therefore, undertaken to assess the correlation between the chronological age, dental age and skeletal ages among different types of twins.\nThe study consisted of 60 subjects (30 twins) aged 8 to 16 years, divided into group of 10 monozygotic, 10 dizygotic and 10 mixed sex twins. The sample was selected from Twin Survey- 2008 conducted by Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopaedics, Sree Balaji Dental College and Hospital, Chennai. Their zygosity was determined by sex, blood groups and by the parent. The chronological age was measured by the date of birth given by the parents. Panoramic and hand wrist x-rays were taken. Dental age was assessed by Demerjian et al method and skeletal age by Greulich and Pyle method. The correlation among twins in dental and skeletal ages with the chronological age was assessed using Correlation Coefficient and Student's't' Test.\nThe obtained data was fed into the computer and statistical analysis was done for the same using the SPSS version 10.0. Statistical significance was tested at P<0.05 level. Mean and Standard Deviation, Correlation Coefficient, Student's't' Test statistical methods were employed. The result showed highly significant 'p' value as <0.001 in all the correlations except for mixed pairs. Descriptive statistics in most of the areas demonstrated a non-significant result between zygosity groups.\nThere is a correlation existing between the individual's chronological age, dental age and skeletal age and correlation also exists in the twin pairs of the same zygosity and among each pair but no correlation exists between different zygotic twins.

    "abstract": "To investigate if cortisol alone or in interaction with other risk factors (familial risk, the serotonin transporter genotype, neuroticism and life events (LEs)) predicts onset of psychiatric disorder in healthy individuals at heritable risk.\nIn a high-risk study, 234 healthy monozygotic and dizygotic twins with or without a co-twin history of affective disorder (high and low risk twins) were baseline assessed. Participants were followed up for seven years and then reassessed with a personal interview revealing whether they had developed psychiatric illness.\n36 participants (15.4%) developed psychiatric disorder. Using Cox proportional hazards ratio (HR) estimates neither morning nor evening salivary cortisol at baseline did predict illness onset. In multivariate Cox models, the two-way interaction between morning cortisol and LEs lifetime before baseline was significantly associated with onset. Further, the HR of onset was higher concerning individuals carrying the short allele of the 5-HTTPLR and having experienced more LEs lifetime. Familial risk for affective disorder predicted illness and the risk of onset was further increased in individuals at familial risk carrying the short allele of the 5-HTTPLR.\nCortisol levels alone do not increase the risk of onset of psychiatric illness but the interaction of a lower cortisol level and the experience of more LEs do. The 5-HTTLPR genotype seems to interact and contribute to increased stress vulnerability in combination with other stress indicators of illness thereby adding to the risk of subsequent psychopathology.",

Using Cox proportional hazards ratio (HR) estimates neither morning nor evening salivary cortisol at baseline did predict illness onset. In multivariate Cox models, the two-way interaction between morning cortisol and LEs lifetime before baseline was significantly associated with onset. Further, the HR of onset was higher concerning individuals carrying the short allele of the 5-HTTPLR and having experienced more LEs lifetime. Familial risk for affective disorder predicted illness and the risk of onset was further increased in individuals at familial risk carrying the short allele of the 5-HTTPLR.",

    "abstract": "Mammographic density, the area of the mammographic image that appears white or bright, predicts breast cancer risk. We estimated the proportions of variance explained by questionnaire-measured breast cancer risk factors and by unmeasured residual familial factors.\nFor 544 MZ and 339 DZ twin pairs and 1,558 non-twin sisters from 1,564 families, mammographic density was measured using the computer-assisted method Cumulus. We estimated associations using multilevel mixed-effects linear regression and studied familial aspects using a multivariate normal model.\nThe proportions of variance explained by age, body mass index (BMI), and other risk factors, respectively, were 4%, 1%, and 4% for dense area; 7%, 14%, and 4% for percent dense area; and 7%, 40%, and 1% for nondense area. Associations with dense area and percent dense area were in opposite directions than for nondense area. After adjusting for measured factors, the correlations of dense area with percent dense area and nondense area were 0.84 and -0.46, respectively. The MZ, DZ, and sister pair correlations were 0.59, 0.28, and 0.29 for dense area; 0.57, 0.30, and 0.28 for percent dense area; and 0.56, 0.27, and 0.28 for nondense area (SE = 0.02, 0.04, and 0.03, respectively).\nUnder the classic twin model, 50% to 60% (SE = 5%) of the variance of mammographic density measures that predict breast cancer risk are due to undiscovered genetic factors, and the remainder to as yet unknown individual-specific, nongenetic factors.\nMuch remains to be learnt about the genetic and environmental determinants of mammographic density.",

    "abstract": "Diurnal preference changes across the lifespan. However, the mechanisms underlying this age-related shift are poorly understood. The aim of this twin study was to determine the extent to which genetic and environmental influences on diurnal preference are moderated by age. Seven hundred and sixty-eight monozygotic and 674 dizygotic adult twin pairs participating in the University of Washington Twin Registry completed the reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire as a measure of diurnal preference. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 93 years (mean\u2009=\u200936.23, SD\u2009=\u200915.54) and were categorized on the basis of age into three groups: younger adulthood (19-35 years, n\u2009=\u20091715 individuals), middle adulthood (36-64 years, n\u2009=\u20091003 individuals) and older adulthood (65+ years, n\u2009=\u2009168 individuals). Increasing age was associated with an increasing tendency towards morningness (r\u2009=\u20090.42, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Structural equation modeling techniques parsed the variance in diurnal preference into genetic and environmental influences for the total sample as well as for each age group separately. Additive genetic influences accounted for 52%[46-57%], and non-shared environmental influences 48%[43-54%], of the total variance in diurnal preference. In comparing univariate genetic models between age groups, the best-fitting model was one in which the parameter estimates for younger adults and older adults were equated, in comparison with middle adulthood. For younger and older adulthood, additive genetic influences accounted for 44%[31-49%] and non-shared environmental influences 56%[49-64%] of variance in diurnal preference, whereas for middle adulthood these estimates were 34%[21-45%] and 66%[55-79%], respectively. Therefore, genetic influences on diurnal preference are attenuated in middle adulthood. Attenuation is likely driven by the increased importance of work and family responsibilities during this life stage, in comparison with younger and older adulthood when these factors may be less influential in determining sleep-wake timing. These findings have implications for studies aimed at identifying specific non-shared environmental influences, as well as molecular genetic studies aimed at identifying specific polymorphisms associated with diurnal preference.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disorders have emerged as major causes of inherited neurologic disease. Despite being well recognized for more than 2 decades, the clinical presentation continues to broaden. The phenotypic heterogeneity is partly owing to different percentage levels of mutant mtDNA heteroplasmy in different tissues, but the factors influencing this are poorly understood.\nThis case report describes monozygotic male twins with ptosis, optic atrophy, and recent-onset intractable myoclonic epilepsy. The assessment of respiratory chain enzyme activities in the muscle from 1 twin revealed a severe and isolated defect involving mitochondrial complex I. Mitochondrial DNA sequencing revealed a pathogenic m.14487T>C MTND6 mutation, which was present at very high levels of heteroplasmy in muscle (84%) and lower levels in blood (15%), urinary epithelium (75%), and buccal mucosa (58%). Of particular interest, his identical twin was found to harbor very similar levels of the m.14487T>C mutation in his blood, urine, buccal mucosa, and hair follicle DNA samples, while the presence of low levels in the mother's tissues confirmed maternal transmission.\nIt was shown that m14487T>C can also cause the unusual combination of optic atrophy, ptosis, and encephalomyopathy leading to intractable seizures. Near-identical heteroplasmy levels in different tissues in both siblings support a nuclear genetic mechanism controlling the tissue segregation of mtDNA mutations.",

    "abstract": "The continuing studies of the teeth and faces of Australian twins and their families in the Craniofacial Biology Research Group in the School of Dentistry at the University of Adelaide began 30 years ago. Three main cohorts of twins have been recruited, enabling various objectives and specific hypotheses to be addressed about the roles of genetic, epigenetic and environmental influences on human dentofacial growth and development, as well as oral health. This paper highlights some key findings arising from these studies, emphasizing those of direct relevance to practising oral health professionals. We also draw on published literature to review the significant developments in relation to the use of precision 2D and 3D imaging equipment, the application of modern molecular techniques, and the development of sophisticated computer software for analysing genetic relationships and comparing complex shapes. Such developments are valuable for current and future work. Apart from the classical or traditional twin model, there are several other twin models that can be used in research to clarify the relative contributions of genetic, epigenetic and environmental contributions to phenotypic variation. The monozygotic (MZ) co-twin model is one particularly valuable method, given that examination of only one pair of MZ twins can provide considerable insights into underlying causes of observed variation. This model can be used in a dental practice environment, with oral health professionals having the opportunity to explore differences in orofacial structures between MZ co-twins who are attending as patients. As researchers have become more aware of the complexities of the interactions between the genome, the epigenome and the environment during development, there is the need to collect more phenotypic data and define new phenotypes that will better characterize variations in growth processes and health status. When coupled with powerful new genetic approaches, including genome-wide association studies and linkage analyses, exciting opportunities are opening up to unravel the causes of problems in craniofacial growth and common oral diseases in human populations.",

    "abstract": "Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a potential biomarker of affective disorder. However, longitudinal studies evaluating a potential predictive role of BDNF on subsequent psychopathology are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate whether BDNF alone or in interaction with the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism predict onset of affective disorder in healthy individuals at heritable risk for affective disorder. In a high-risk study, we assessed whole blood levels of BDNF in 234 healthy monozygotic and dizygotic twins with or without a co-twin history of affective disorder (high and low risk twins, respectively). Participants were followed up longitudinally with questionnaires at 6-month intervals for mean seven years and then reassessed with a personal interview to obtain information about whether they had developed psychiatric illness. At follow-up 36 participants (15.4%) had developed psychiatric disorder. Cox regression analysis revealed that BDNF levels at baseline were not associated with onset of illness in this explorative study. Further, two-way interactions between BDNF levels and the Val66Met polymorphism or between familial risk and the Val66Met polymorphism did not predict illness onset.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the perinatal outcome of three types of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR).\nFrom January 2005 to June 2012, clinical data of 42 pairs of MCDA twins (84 fetuses) with sIUGR and 71 pairs of normal MCDA twins (142 fetuses) in the same period were analyzed retrospectively in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University. Fetuses with sIUGR were classified into three groups based on umbilical artery Doppler flow.There were 25 cases of type I, 11 cases of type II and 6 cases of type III. The perinatal outcome was compared between sIUGR and normal MCDA twins, and among the three types of sIUGR as well. Perinatal outcomes included gestational age at delivery, rate of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD), birth weight, intertwin discordance of birth weight, neonatal death and survival rate at 6 months.\n(1) The gestational age of sIUGR at delivery was significantly earlier than the control group [(34\u00b13), (36\u00b12) weeks, respectively], and the rate of IUFD of both fetuses of sIUGR was significantly higher (4.8%, 0, respectively). In the sIUGR group, the average birth weight of large or small twins [(2130\u00b1350), (1520\u00b1400) g, respectively] was smaller than those in the control group [(2470\u00b1500), (2340\u00b1460) g, respectively]. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.05, P<0.01, respectively). The intertwin discordance of birth weight in sIUGR group was significantly larger (27.6%) than the control group (4.0%, P<0.01). (2) The gestational age at delivery in type II and type III [(34\u00b15), (34\u00b12) weeks, respectively] was significantly earlier than the control group (P<0.05). The rate of IUFD of both fetuses in type II (18%) was significantly higher than in type I (0) and the control group (0, P<0.05). In sIUGR group, the average birth weight of small twins in type I, type II and type III was (1640\u00b1430), (1330\u00b1310) and (1500\u00b1380) g respectively, all of which were significantly smaller than that in the control group (P<0.05). The average birth weight of small twins in type II was smaller than in type I and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). In sIUGR group, the intertwin discordance of birth weight in type I, type II and type III was 24.1%, 34.6%, 31.3% respectively, all of which were significantly larger than that in the control group (4.0%, P<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences of the intertwin discordance of birth weight among the three types of sIUGR (P>0.05). Survival rate at 6 months in type II (64%) was significantly lower than in type I (92%) and the control group (91.5%, P<0.01).\nThe perinatal outcome of MCDA twins with sIUGR is poor. The outcome is different among the three types of sIUGR, and typeIIis the worst. Type II is associated with a high risk of intrauterine fetal demise. It is important to monitor the intrauterine situation closely.",

The vascular distribution type (parallel, crossed, mixed and monoamniotic), the anastomosis of vessels and the placental sharing were recorded. The outcome of pregnancy and the placental characteristics of birth weight discordance (birth weight discordance\u226520%) in non-TTTS MC twins were analyzed.\n(1) The outcome of pregnancy: the miscarriage or gestational weeks of 28 MC twins were 20 to 38 weeks (median of 35 weeks). Six cases were TTTS, 3 of which received fetoscopic laser occlusion of communicating vessels (FLOC). There were 48 live births, with an average birth weight of (2036\u00b1623) g. (2) Type of placental vascular distribution:in the 28 MC placentas, number of parallel, crossed, mixed and monoamniotic type of placental vascular distribution were 4 (14%), 14 (50%), 6 (21%) and 4 (14%) cases, respectively. No parallel type was found in TTTS. There was no significant difference of vascular anastomosis or unequal placental sharing among the different placental vascular distribution types (P>0.05). (3) Characteristics of placental vascular distribution in birth weight discordance twins:there were 20 non-TTTS MC twin pregnancies, all of which got live births of both babies. Birth weight discordance equal to or more than 20% was found in 6 pairs of newborns, while birth weight discordance less than 20% was found in the rest 14 cases. Ratio of unequal placental sharing was significantly different between the two groups (P<0.01). There was no significant difference of umbilical cord insertion, placental vascular distribution and anastomosis in the two groups (P>0.01).\nVascular distribution type of MC twins might be related to TTTS. Unequal placental sharing is a risk factor of birth weight discordance in non-TTTS MC twins.",

Six cases were TTTS, 3 of which received fetoscopic laser occlusion of communicating vessels (FLOC). There were 48 live births, with an average birth weight of (2036\u00b1623) g. (2) Type of placental vascular distribution:in the 28 MC placentas, number of parallel, crossed, mixed and monoamniotic type of placental vascular distribution were 4 (14%), 14 (50%), 6 (21%) and 4 (14%) cases, respectively. No parallel type was found in TTTS. There was no significant difference of vascular anastomosis or unequal placental sharing among the different placental vascular distribution types (P>0.05). (3) Characteristics of placental vascular distribution in birth weight discordance twins:there were 20 non-TTTS MC twin pregnancies, all of which got live births of both babies. Birth weight discordance equal to or more than 20% was found in 6 pairs of newborns, while birth weight discordance less than 20% was found in the rest 14 cases. Ratio of unequal placental sharing was significantly different between the two groups (P<0.01). There was no significant difference of umbilical cord insertion, placental vascular distribution and anastomosis in the two groups (P>0.01).",

    "abstract": "Not all obese individuals display the metabolic disturbances commonly associated with excess fat accumulation. Mechanisms maintaining this 'metabolically healthy obesity' (MHO) are as yet unknown. We aimed to study different fat depots and transcriptional pathways in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) as related to the MHO phenomenon.\nSixteen rare young adult obesity-discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs (intra-pair difference (\u2206) in BMI \u2265 3 kg/m(2)), aged 22.8-35.8 years, were examined for detailed characteristics of metabolic health (subcutaneous, intra-abdominal and liver fat [magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy]), OGTT, lipids, adipokines and C-reactive protein (CRP). Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 chips were used to analyse transcriptomics pathways related to mitochondrial function and inflammation in SAT.\nBased on liver fat accumulation, two metabolically different subgroups emerged. In half (8/16) of the pairs (\u2206weight 17.1 \u00b1 2.0 kg), the obese co-twin had significantly higher liver fat (\u2206718%), 78% increase in AUC insulin during OGTT and CRP, significantly more disturbance in the lipid profile and greater tendency for hypertension compared with the lean co-twin. In these obese co-twins, SAT expression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, branched-chain amino acid catabolism, fatty acid oxidation and adipocyte differentiation pathways were downregulated and chronic inflammation upregulated. In the other eight pairs (\u2206weight 17.4 \u00b1 2.8 kg), the obese co-twin did not differ from the non-obese co-twin in liver fat (\u22068%), insulin sensitivity, CRP, lipids, blood pressure or SAT transcriptomics.\nOur results suggest that maintenance of high mitochondrial transcription and lack of inflammation in SAT are associated with low liver fat and MHO.",

    "abstract": "The current study investigated how the brain structure-function relationships between covert and overt verbal fluency in monozygotic handedness discordant (MzHd) twins relates to broader attentional measures. Evidence presented here shows that the structure-function correlation demonstrated between functional cerebral lateralisation and corpus callosum widths 22-39, contiguous with Broca's area and the middle frontal gyri (Gurd et al. in Brain Struct Funct 218:491-509, 2013), is not an artefact of attention. Twenty-five pairs of female MzHd twins performed a verbal switching task titrated for number of switches. The paradigm permits calculation of switch rates and costs. The switch rate and cost varied as a function of number of switches (1, 2, 3). There were no differences in any measure in relation to right-left handedness in twin pairs. This was supported by large and significant within-twin pair correlations. Atypical functional lateralisation of inferior and middle frontal lobes does not appear to be associated with better or worse performance on verbal task-switching. Discordant lateralisation for verbal fluency does not predict behavioural performance profiles in MzHd twins. This evidence is compatible with a view that attentional components of verbal fluency task performance may have significant heritable components. It does not indicate that neural correlates of frontal cerebral laterality for verbal fluency in MzHd twins are significantly accountable for by heritable components.",

    "abstract": "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a severe, systemic illness characterized by persistent, debilitating and medically unexplained fatigue. The etiology and pathophysiology of CFS remains obscure, and diagnosis is formulated through the patient's history and exclusion of other medical causes. Thereby, the availability of biomarkers for CFS could be useful for clinical research. In the present study, we used a proteomic approach to evaluate the global changes in the salivary profile in a couple of monozygotic twins who were discordant for CFS. The aim was to evaluate differences of salivary protein expression in the CFS patient in respect to his healthy twin.\nSaliva samples were submitted to two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). The gels were stained with Sypro, and a comparison between CFS subject and the healthy one was performed by the software Progenesis Same Spot including the Analysis of variance (ANOVA test). The proteins spot found with a \u22652-fold spot quantity change and p<0.05 were identified by Nano-liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. To validate the expression changes found with 2DE of 5 proteins (14-3-3 protein zeta/delta, cyclophilin A, Cystatin-C, Protein S100-A7, and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein), we used the western blot analysis. Moreover, proteins differentially expressed were functionally analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software with the aim to determine the predominant canonical pathways and the interaction network involved.\nThe analysis of the protein profiles allowed us to find 13 proteins with a different expression in CFS in respect to control. Nine spots were up-regulated in CFS and 4 down-regulated. These proteins belong to different functional classes, such as inflammatory response, immune system and metabolism. In particular, as shown by the pathway analysis, the network built with our proteins highlights the involvement of inflammatory response in CFS pathogenesis.\nThis study shows the presence of differentially expressed proteins in the saliva of the couple of monozygotic twins discordant for CFS, probably related to the disease. Consequently, we believe the proteomic approach could be useful both to define a panel of potential diagnostic biomarkers and to shed new light on the comprehension of the pathogenetic pathways of CFS.",

    "abstract": "Based on molecular-dynamics simulations validated with quantum-mechanical calculations, we predict that (111) twin planes in a [111]-oriented GaAs nanowire attain attractive interactions mediated by surface strain. This gives rise to a self-replication mechanism that continuously generates a twin superlattice in a nanowire during growth. We demonstrate significant implications of the twin-twin interaction for the electronic, mechanical, and chemical properties of nanowires. These unique properties suggest potential applications such as catalysts for solar fuel production and nanoscale mechanical dampers.",

Two groups were studied on the basis of fetal ultrasonographic findings: 16 twins with and 57 twins without selective intrauterine growth restriction. Selective intrauterine growth restriction was defined as an estimated fetal weight below the 10th percentile in one twin at 18 to 26 weeks of gestation. Serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels were measured.\nSerum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels in monochorionic diamniotic twins with selective intrauterine growth restriction were significantly higher than in those without selective intrauterine growth restriction. Selective intrauterine growth restriction was independently associated with increased N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels.\nN-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels at birth are elevated in monochorionic diamniotic twins with selective intrauterine growth restriction.",

    "abstract": "Our appearance changes over time, yet we can recognize ourselves in photographs from across the lifespan. Researchers have extensively studied self-recognition in photographs and have proposed that specific neural correlates are involved, but few studies have examined self-recognition using images from different periods of life. Here we compared ERP responses to photographs of participants when they were 5-15, 16-25, and 26-45 years old. We found marked differences between the responses to photographs from these time periods in terms of the neural markers generally assumed to reflect (i) the configural processing of faces (i.e., the N170), (ii) the matching of the currently perceived face to a representation already stored in memory (i.e., the P250), and (iii) the retrieval of information about the person being recognized (i.e., the N400). There was no uniform neural signature of visual self-recognition. To test whether there was anything specific to self-recognition in these brain responses, we also asked participants to identify photographs of their dizygotic twins taken from the same time periods. Critically, this allowed us to minimize the confounding effects of exposure, for it is likely that participants have been similarly exposed to each other's faces over the lifespan. The same pattern of neural response emerged with only one exception: the neural marker reflecting the retrieval of mnemonic information (N400) differed across the lifespan for self but not for twin. These results, as well as our novel approach using twins and photographs from across the lifespan, have wide-ranging consequences for the study of self-recognition and the nature of our personal identity through time.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to characterize multiple psychotic experiences, each assessed on a spectrum of severity (ie, quantitatively), in a general population sample of adolescents. Over five thousand 16-year-old twins and their parents completed the newly devised Specific Psychotic Experiences Questionnaire (SPEQ); a subsample repeated it approximately 9 months later. SPEQ was investigated in terms of factor structure, intersubscale correlations, frequency of endorsement and reported distress, reliability and validity, associations with traits of anxiety, depression and personality, and sex differences. Principal component analysis revealed a 6-component solution: paranoia, hallucinations, cognitive disorganization, grandiosity, anhedonia, and parent-rated negative symptoms. These components formed the basis of 6 subscales. Correlations between different experiences were low to moderate. All SPEQ subscales, except Grandiosity, correlated significantly with traits of anxiety, depression, and neuroticism. Scales showed good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent validity. Girls endorsed more paranoia, hallucinations, and cognitive disorganization; boys reported more grandiosity and anhedonia and had more parent-rated negative symptoms. As in adults at high risk for psychosis and with psychotic disorders, psychotic experiences in adolescents are characterized by multiple components. The study of psychotic experiences as distinct dimensional quantitative traits is likely to prove an important strategy for future research, and the SPEQ is a self- and parent-report questionnaire battery that embodies this approach.",

    "abstract": "Opsoclonus is characterized by rapid bursts of involuntary, multidirectional, saccades without an intersaccadic interval. Three types of opsoclonus that occur in infancy have been identified, 2 of which are associated with a systemic or neurologic condition. The third is a benign condition that occurs transiently in healthy neonates and preterm babies. We report a case of 2 healthy twins who presented with transient opsoclonus, which was confined only to the vertical plane and manifested only in a supine position. Opsoclonus disappeared when the cheek was tapped. These eye movements began at 3 months and completely resolved by 6 months of age.",

    "abstract": "The early years in life are increasingly recognized as a critical period for the development of diet-related behavioral traits. However, discussions continue on the relative role of genes and the environment in determining dietary intake, particularly in young children for whom detailed dietary information is limited.\nThis study tested the hypothesis that diet in early childhood is primarily determined by the environment rather than by genes. A secondary aim was to characterize the early childhood diet.\nA classic twin design used 3-d dietary data collected at age 21 mo from the Gemini cohort. From the full sample of 2402 families with twins, dietary diaries were available for 1216 twin pairs (384 monozygotic and 832 dizygotic pairs) after exclusions. Intakes of macronutrients, food, and beverages were estimated. Twin analyses quantified the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to population variation in intake.\nAt age 21 mo, children consumed small portions of a wide range of family foods. The shared environment was the predominant determinant, contributing between 66% (95% CI: 52%, 77%; milk-based desserts) and 97% (95% CI: 95%, 98%; juice) of the variation in intake. Genetic factors were estimated to account for between 4% (95% CI: 0%, 10%; savory snacks) and 18% (95% CI: 14%, 23%; bread) of dietary intake variation.\nShared environmental influences are the predominant drivers of dietary intake in very young children, indicating the importance of factors such as the home food environment and parental behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Occupations and psychosocial working conditions have rarely been investigated as predictors of disability pension in population-based samples. This study investigated how occupational groups and psychosocial working conditions are associated with future disability pension due to musculoskeletal diagnoses, accounting for familial factors in the associations.\nA sample of 24,543 same-sex Swedish twin individuals was followed from 1993 to 2008 using nationwide registries. Baseline data on occupations were categorized into eight sector-defined occupational groups. These were further used to reflect psychosocial working conditions by applying the job strain scores of a Job Exposure Matrix. Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) were estimated.\nDuring the 12-year (average) follow-up, 7% of the sample was granted disability pension due to musculoskeletal diagnoses. Workers in health care and social work; agriculture, forestry and fishing; transportation; production and mining; and the service and military work sectors were two to three times more likely to receive a disability pension than those in the administration and management sector. Each single unit decrease in job demands and each single unit increase in job control and social support significantly predicted disability pension. Individuals with high work strain or an active job had a lower hazard ratio of disability pension, whereas a passive job predicted a significantly higher hazard ratio. Accounting for familial confounding did not alter these results.\nOccupational groups and psychosocial working conditions seem to be independent of familial confounding, and hence represent risk factors for disability pension due to musculoskeletal diagnoses. This means that preventive measures in these sector-defined occupational groups and specific psychosocial working conditions might prevent disability pension due to musculoskeletal diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate data regarding neonatal mortality and short term morbidity among iatrogenic late preterm (ILP) and spontaneous late preterm (SLP) twin births, and to estimate whether medical interventions - induction of labor in this particular context, are associated with better or poorer outcomes.\nRetrospective analysis of 110 late preterm dichorionic twin pregnancies was performed basing on medical charts data. All twins were delivered in years 2005-2011 at the 1st Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Medical University of Warsaw Late preterm twins, defined as those delivered between 34 + 0-36+ 6 weeks of gestation, were divided into spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm births. The primary outcomes of the study were various neonatal adverse events, including one of the following per pregnancy: admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), respiratory disorders (RD) and pneumonia, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), sepsis, NEC and jaundice requiring phototherapy Mann-Whitney U-test and chi-squared test were used and logistic regression performed to calculate odds ratio, with p value < 0.05 considered significant.\nThere were 69 (62.7%) spontaneous and 41 (37.3%) iatrogenic late preterm twins. There were no differences in maternal characteristics, mode of delivery and newborns' Apgar scores. The mean birth weight did not differ significantly between the groups. There was one case of perinatal death of one twin in ILP group. Preeclampsia (31.7%) and IUGR (17%) were the most frequent indications for labor induction in ILR Women in the ILP group were administered steroid treatment for lung maturation more frequently than SLP group due to pregnancy complications (73.17% vs. 30.44%; p < 0.0001). Nevertheless, ILP twins were at higher risk of respiratory disorders (41.46% vs. 15.94%; p = 0.003--significant either with or without pneumonia) and NICU admission (31.71% vs. 14.49%; p = 0.032) than SLP twins. The only two independent factors influencing the occurrence of poor neonatal outcome were gestational age in weeks (OR 0.57; 95% Cl 0.34-0.94) and preeclampsia (OR 5.01; 95% CI 1.51-16.67). In the additional analysis of gestational age odds ratio, only the delivery at 34 weeks of gestation increased the incidence of adverse neonatal outcome almost five times (OR 4.94, 95% Cl: 1.64-14.88). The rate of cesarean delivery in the SLP was 81.61%, while in the ILP it reached 90.23% (p = 0.17).\nLate prematurity in twin pregnancies is associated with higher risk of neonatal morbidity than in term twins. Iatrogenic late preterm birth increases the risk of NICU admission and respiratory disorders in neonates in comparison to spontaneous late preterm birth. Despite the fact that respiratory complications are generally mild and mostly temporary there is a need for careful evaluation of indications for delivery in that particular group.",

    "abstract": "Clinic and long-term average blood pressure (BP) are heritable traits with estimates of heritability ranging from 0.31 to 0.68. Long-term visit-to-visit BP variability (BPV) is emerging as a new cardiovascular risk predictor, though it is unclear if this is completely independent of BP. We hypothesize that BPV should demonstrate the same pattern of additive genetic, shared environmental and unique environmental variance as BP, if both are phenotypic surrogates.\nWe studied 2889 twin pairs not on any BP-lowering therapy from the Twins UK cohort, and estimated the additive genetic variance for baseline BP, long-term average BP, BP trajectory (rate of change of BP in mmHg/year) and BPV (coefficient of variation and average real variability over an average of 3.2 visits). Heritability estimates were obtained by structural equation modelling adjusting for age, age, sex and BMI.\nThe heritabilities for baseline SBP and DBP were 0.51 (95% confidence interval 0.49, 0.53) and 0.56 (0.54, 0.58); long-term average SBP and DBP were 0.56 (0.53, 0.59) and 0.61 (0.58, 0.64); and systolic and diastolic trajectories over 10 years were 0.49 (0.46, 0.52) and 0.29 (0.27, 0.32), respectively. Both overall systolic and diastolic BPV showed no additive genetic variance contributing to the phenotypic variation, but after stratification by age, the younger subgroup (<51 years) showed heritability estimates of 0.44 (0.38, 0.50) for coefficient of variation and 0.35 (0.29, 0.41) for average real variability.\nAge is a major factor that influences heritability estimation of BPV and it is likely that BPV in younger and older age groups may reflect different pathological phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The preterm gut microbiome is a complex dynamic community influenced by genetic and environmental factors and is implicated in the pathogenesis of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and sepsis. We aimed to explore the longitudinal development of the gut microbiome in preterm twins to determine how shared environmental and genetic factors may influence temporal changes and compared this to the expressed breast milk (EBM) microbiome. Stool samples (n = 173) from 27 infants (12 twin pairs and 1 triplet set) and EBM (n = 18) from 4 mothers were collected longitudinally. All samples underwent PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) analysis and a selected subset underwent 454 pyrosequencing. Stool and EBM shared a core microbiome dominated by Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae, and Staphylococcaceae. The gut microbiome showed greater similarity between siblings compared to unrelated individuals. Pyrosequencing revealed a reduction in diversity and increasing dominance of Escherichia sp. preceding NEC that was not observed in the healthy twin. Antibiotic treatment had a substantial effect on the gut microbiome, reducing Escherichia sp. and increasing other Enterobacteriaceae. This study demonstrates related preterm twins share similar gut microbiome development, even within the complex environment of neonatal intensive care. This is likely a result of shared genetic and immunomodulatory factors as well as exposure to the same maternal microbiome during birth, skin contact and exposure to EBM. Environmental factors including antibiotic exposure and feeding are additional significant determinants of community structure, regardless of host genetics.",

    "abstract": "Menarche or first menstrual period is a landmark in reproductive life span and it is the most prominent change of puberty. The timing of menarche can be under the influence of genes as well as individual environmental factors interacting with genetic factors.\nOur study objectives were (a) to investigate the heritability of age of menarche in twins, (b) to obtain the association between age of menarche and childhood factors, and reproductive events/behavior, (c) to examine whether or not having a male co-twin affects early/late menarche.\nA group of female-female identical (n = 108, 54 pairs), non-identical twins (n = 68, 34 pairs) and 17 females from opposite-sex twin sets were identified from twin registries of Malaysia and Iran. Genetic analysis was performed via two methods of Falconers' formula and maximum likelihood.\nHeritability was found to be 66% using Falconers' formula and 15% using univariate twin analysis. Model analysis revealed that shared environmental factors have a major contribution in determining the age of menarche (82%) followed by non-shared environment (18%).\nResult of this study is consistent with that of the literature. Timing of menarche could be under the influence of shared and non-shared environmental effects. Hirsutism was found to have a higher frequency among subjects with late menarche. There was no significant difference in age of menarche between females of opposite-sex twins and females of same-sex twins.\nIt is concluded that twin models provide a powerful means of examining the total genetic contribution to age of menarche. Longitudinal studies of twins may clarify the type of environmental effects that determine the age of menarche.",

The association between VCI and several outcomes was estimated.\nA total of 630 monochorionic placentas with TTTS (n = 304) and without TTTS (n = 326) were studied. The incidence of VCI in the TTTS and non-TTTS group was 36.8% and 35.9%, respectively (P = 0.886). The presence of VCI in one twin was significantly associated with small for gestational age (SGA) status (odds ratio [OR] 1.45, 95% CI 1.13, 1.87) and severe birth weight discordance (OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.93, 4.96). Our results also showed significant interaction between TTTS and VCI when we considered intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) and gestational age (GA) at birth. The prevalence of IUFD in monochorionic pregnancies without TTTS increased from 4.6% to 14.1% in the presence of VCI (P = 0.027). In the TTTS group, the prevalence of IUFD was comparable in the absence or presence of VCI. Similarly, GA at birth was significantly lower in the presence of VCI only in the non-TTTS group.\nOur findings suggest that VCI is not associated with the development of TTTS but increases the risk of adverse outcomes. Both VCI and TTTS independently increase the prevalence of IUFD and lower GA at birth in a similar way, showing that VCI is an important indicator of adverse perinatal outcome in monochorionic twins.",

    "abstract": "The role of specific gut microbes in shaping body composition remains unclear. We transplanted fecal microbiota from adult female twin pairs discordant for obesity into germ-free mice fed low-fat mouse chow, as well as diets representing different levels of saturated fat and fruit and vegetable consumption typical of the U.S. diet. Increased total body and fat mass, as well as obesity-associated metabolic phenotypes, were transmissible with uncultured fecal communities and with their corresponding fecal bacterial culture collections. Cohousing mice harboring an obese twin's microbiota (Ob) with mice containing the lean co-twin's microbiota (Ln) prevented the development of increased body mass and obesity-associated metabolic phenotypes in Ob cage mates. Rescue correlated with invasion of specific members of Bacteroidetes from the Ln microbiota into Ob microbiota and was diet-dependent. These findings reveal transmissible, rapid, and modifiable effects of diet-by-microbiota interactions.",

    "abstract": "Single intrauterine fetal demise in monochorionic (MC) twins may result in acute exsanguination from the surviving twin into the low-pressure circulation of the demised co-twin through the vascular anastomoses. This may lead to severe hypoxic-ischemic injury in the surviving twin due to hypovolemia, hypotension and anemia, resulting in multiorgan damage. Most studies in single fetal demise in MC twin pregnancies have reported on the risk of cerebral injury. The aim of our study was to explore the incidence and severity of renal damage in surviving MC twins after intrauterine co-twin death. We reviewed all cases of MC twins with single fetal demise presented over a 10-year period at our center. One of the 44 (2.3%) surviving co-twins was diagnosed with severe renal damage. We describe this case in detail, as it provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of renal and other organ failure after MC co-twin death.",

Sonographic examination is essential for prenatal diagnosis as early detection of fetal anomalies with poor prognosis provides a chance to deliver the infant vaginally for the mother. We herein describe a case with a prenatal diagnosis of a parasitic twin using three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound. The clear images obtained with 3-D ultrasound helped in counseling the parents. Making an early prenatal diagnosis of severe fetal anomalies with careful and sophisticated sonographic examinations should be warranted.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare entity. Only few cases have been reported in the medical literature. They are a rare and exclusive type of monozygotic twins. They are caused by a faulty division of the embryonic disk. Due to high post-natal morbidity and mortality, an early pre-natal diagnosis is a must. All the monozygotic twins should be carefully screened for conjoinnment and if it is present, the type and the degree of sharing of the foetal organs should be delineated. There are many associated anomalies, of which congenital heart defects are the major prognostic factors. Here, we are reporting a case of thoraco-omphalopagus in which there was sharing of the foetal heart, liver and the intestinal loops.",

    "abstract": "Accelerated infant growth is associated with an altered, mostly adverse adult cardiometabolic risk profile. The importance of genetic and environmental factors to these associations is unclear.\nThe objective was to examine the importance of genetic and environmental factors in the associations between infant growth and adult cardiometabolic risk factors (anthropometric characteristics, lipids, insulin sensitivity, leptin, blood pressure, and fibrinogen) in twins.\nCardiometabolic risk factors were assessed in 240 twin pairs (aged 18-34 y) from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. Infant growth was defined as change in weight z score. We regressed intrapair differences in growth during 4 growth windows (0-1, 1-6, 6-12, and 12-24 mo) against intrapair differences in the risk factors in monozygotic and dizygotic twins separately.\nWithin monozygotic twin pairs only, associations between infant growth and most adult lipids, glucose, leptin, and blood pressure (eg, systolic blood pressure: b = 5.95 mm Hg per change in z score, P = 0.01 in monozygotic twins; b = -1.64, P = 0.82 in dizygotic twins from 12 to 24 mo) were found. Within dizygotic twin pairs only, associations between growth and triglycerides and fibrinogen (eg, fibrinogen: b = 0.07 ln mg/dL per change in z score, P = 0.31 in monozygotic twins; b = 0.79, P = 0.01 in dizygotic twins from 0 to 1 mo) were identified. Most associations showed a detrimental effect of accelerated growth, but beneficial associations were also identified (eg, total-to-high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol ratio: b = -0.22 per change in z score from 1 to 6 mo, P = 0.008 in monozygotic twins).\nOur data showed that environmental factors play a role in the associations between infant growth and most adult lipids, glucose, leptin, and blood pressure, whereas genetic factors are involved regarding triglycerides and fibrinogen.",

    "abstract": "To assess the association of mode of conception and sex concordance with neonatal outcomes in very preterm twins.\nTwin pairs born at gestational age \u2264 32 weeks and admitted to a Level 3 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in 2010-2011 were retrospectively identified from the Canadian Neonatal Network\u2122 database. A composite outcome representing neonatal mortality or any severe morbidity (intraventricular hemorrhage grades \u2265 3 or periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity stages \u2265 3, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or necrotizing enterocolitis stages \u2265 2) was compared between twins conceived using assisted reproduction technologies (ARTs) or spontaneously (SP), and tested for association with sex concordance in individual-level and pair-wise multivariable logistic regression analyses.\nStudy subjects included 1,508 twins from 216 ART (53 [25%] male-male, 104 [48%] male-female, and 59 [27%] female-female) and 538 SP (192 [36%] male-male, 123 [23%] male-female, and 223 [41%] female-female) pairs. No statistically significant association was detected between mode of conception and the composite outcome of mortality/morbidities. The composite outcome was significantly higher in same-sex than in opposite-sex twins (OR = 1.68; 95% CI = [1.09, 2.59]). This relationship was most pronounced in ART pairs (OR = 2.25; 95% CI = [1.02, 4.98]), with increased rates in one or both twins from male-male versus opposite-sex ART pairs (OR = 3.0; 95% CI = [1.07, 8.36]).\nSame-sex pairing was associated with higher mortality/morbidities in very preterm twins admitted to the NICU, and can be used in clinical practice to identify twins at higher risk of adverse neonatal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The study aims to determine the differences in maternal and perinatal outcomes between caesarean and vaginal deliveries and the factors affecting vaginal delivery in twin pregnancy.\nAn observational study to audit twin pregnancies delivered at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital between 2002 and 2008. Clinical observations were entered into a questionnaire immediately after the delivery of the women and the mothers and their babies were followed up until the end of the puerperium.\nThere were 5298 deliveries within the study period, out of which 117 were twin deliveries. This gives a twinning rate of 22 per 1000 deliveries. The mean age of the mothers was 30 \u00b1 5.9 years. Twenty-five (21.4%) women were admitted into the hospital for preterm labor. The average gestational age of admission was 32 \u00b1 5.8 weeks and the average duration of hospital stay for preterm labor was 12.6 \u00b1 9.1 days. Other pregnancy complications observed were severe hypertension (14.5%, anemia (9.4%), postpartum hemorrhage (8.5%), puerperal fever (5.1%), abruptio placentae, and diabetic mellitus (2.7%). Fifty-nine women (50.4%) had vaginal deliveries, 5 (4.3%) had vaginal delivery of the leading twin and caesarean delivery of the retained second twin while 53 women (45.3%) were delivered by caesarean section. Forty-eight (41%) women had preterm delivery. Vaginal deliveries were more common than caesarean section among patients that were unbooked than booked P = 0.047 (OR 2.26, 95%CI:0.93-5.53) and those that had cephalic presentation of the leading twin, P = 0.0002 (OR = 4.7 95% CI:2.6-8.2). Vaginal delivery tended toward statistical significance when the fetal weight of the leading twin was 1.5 to 2.5 kg, P = 0.09. The commonest indications for caesarean section were abnormal lies and presentations and hypertension in pregnancy.Two-hundred and seventeen (92.7%) out of a total of 234 fetuses that were delivered in this study were live births and 17 (7.3%) still births. The rate of new born admissions in twin 1 was however higher in those delivered by Caesarean section (39.6%) than those delivered vaginally (29.7%). Indications for admissions into the special baby care units were; prematurity 33 (40.2%), birth asphyxia 15 (18.3%), low birth weight 12 (14.6%), neonatal jaundice 10 (12.2%), and twin-twin transfusion 4 (4.9%). There was a higher rate of early neonatal death in both vaginally delivered twin 1 (9.4%) and twin 2 (11.9%) than those delivered by Caesarean section, 3.8 and 3.5%, respectively.\nCephalic presentation of the leading twin, birth weight less than 2.5 kg, and unbooked women presenting in advanced labor predisposed to vaginal delivery in twin pregnancies.

    "abstract": "Bordetella pertussis or whooping cough is a vaccine-preventable disease that still remains a serious infection in neonates and young infants. We describe two young infants, monozygotic twins, with a severe B. pertussis pneumonia of whom one needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Diagnostic work-up of unexplained hematuria and proteinuria during the illness revealed low serum complement component 3 (C3) levels. During follow-up, C3 levels remained low (400-600\u00a0mg/L). Extensive analysis of the persistent low C3 levels revealed an unknown heterozygous mutation in the C3 gene in both siblings and their mother. This C3 mutation in combination with the specific virulence mechanisms of B. pertussis probably contributed to the severe disease course in these cases.\nWe propose that genetically caused complement disorders should be considered when confronted with severe cases of B. pertussis infection.",

    "abstract": "To examine the heritability of refractive astigmatism in older women.\nAstigmatism was measured with an autorefractor in 88 monozygotic and 82 dizygotic female twin pairs aged 63 to 75 years. The prevalence and distribution of astigmatism and polar values J0 and J45 were estimated by standard statistical methods. Bivariate maximum likelihood model fitting was used to estimate genetic and environmental variance components using information from both eyes.\nMean astigmatism of the more astigmatic eye was 0.93 diopters (D; SD \u00b10.58). Astigmatism of at least 0.25 D, 0.5 D, 0.75 D, or 1.0 D in either eye was present in 99.7%, 88.5%, 66.5%, and 46.2% of cases, respectively. The main direction of astigmatism was against the rule. The age-adjusted quantitative genetic modeling revealed that additive genetic effects accounted for 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.9%-43.8%) of the total variance of astigmatism and for 18% (95% CI, 4%-31%) of the total variance of polar value J45 of both eyes (bivariate model), with the remaining variances due to nongenetic effects. There were no significant correlations between the twin pairs for polar value J0.\nIn elderly female twins, additive genetic effects accounted for one-third of the variance of the amount of astigmatism and only a small fraction of the total variance of polar value J45.",

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome results from an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Expansion of a maternal premutation allele is the mechanism by which a full mutation allele arises; contraction of a maternal premutation allele is rare. Here we report on both an expansion and contraction of a maternal FMR1 premutation allele in fraternal twins. The propositus was the product of a 29-week gestation twin pregnancy and was referred for FMR1 testing due to developmental delay. A FMR1 full mutation with complete methylation was observed on Southern blot analysis. Evaluation of the maternal FMR1 gene by PCR revealed a normal and premutation allele with CGG repeat numbers of 30 and 93, respectively. Subsequent FMR1 testing on the twin sister of the propositus detected CGG repeat numbers of 30 and 54. The FMR1 CGG repeat number of the reproductive partner was 30. The FMR1 CGG repeat 30 allele in the twin sister was determined to be of paternal origin and the FMR1 allele with a CGG repeat number of 54 was of maternal origin. This observation is particularly interesting not only because of the concomitant donation of a FMR1 expanded and contracted premutation allele in a twin pregnancy but also because of the significant degree of contraction (39 repeats) of the maternal premutation allele.",

    "abstract": "Twins in Africa may be at increased risk of metabolic disorders due to strained conditions in utero, including high exposure to infections. We studied metabolic syndrome (MS) and diabetes mellitus (DM) among young twins and singletons in Guinea-Bissau.\nThe study was cross-sectional and occurred from October 2009 until August 2011 at the Bandim Health Project, a demographic surveillance site in the capital Bissau. Twins and singleton controls between 5 and 32 years were visited at home. Fasting blood samples for metabolic measurements were collected. Zygosity was established genetically for a subset. DM was defined as HbA1c \u22656.5% (48 mmol/mol) and MS by the International Diabetes Federation criteria.\nHbA1c was available for 574 twins and 463 singletons. Mean age was 15.3 years versus 15.8 years, respectively. Eighteen percent of twins were monozygotic. There were no DM cases among twins but one among singletons. A total of 1.4% (8 of 574) of twins had elevated HbA1c (6.0-6.4%, 42-46 mmol/mol) compared with 2.4% (11 of 463) of singletons (P = 0.28). Mean HbA1c was 5.3% (34 mmol/mol) for both groups. MS data were available for 364 twins and 360 singletons. The MS prevalence was 3.0% (11 of 364) among twins and 3.6% (13 of 360) among singletons (P = 0.66). The prevalence of fasting blood glucose (F-glucose) \u22655.6 mmol/L was 34.9% (127 of 364) for twins versus 24.7% (89 of 360) for singletons (P = 0.003). Median homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance did not differ (P = 0.34).\nThe MS and DM prevalences among young individuals in Guinea-Bissau were low. Twins did not have a higher MS and DM burden than singletons, though elevated F-glucose was more common among twins.",

    "abstract": "Precise placement of twin boundaries and stacking faults promises new opportunities to fundamentally manipulate the optical, electrical, and thermal properties of semiconductor nanowires. Here we report on the appearance of consecutive twin boundaries in Si nanowires and show that sidewall morphology governs their spacing. Detailed electron microscopy analysis reveals that thin {111} sidewall facets, which elongate following the first twin boundary (TB1), are responsible for deforming the triple-phase line and favoring the formation of the second twin boundary (TB2). While multiple, geometrically correlated defect planes are known in group III-V nanowires, our findings show that this behavior is also possible in group IV materials.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, monochorionicity has been regarded as synonymous with monozygosity. However, several recent cases of monochorionic dizygotic twins have shown that monochorionic twins can be dizygous. We report a rare case of monochorionic diamnionic, gender-discordant twins who were conceived spontaneously. Initially, a monochorionic placenta was diagnosed by ultrasonography at 8 weeks of gestation and then confirmed by pathology after delivery. The twins had different genders. A comparison of cytogenetic analyses using peripheral blood lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts revealed that chimerism was confined to blood cells. We have experienced two cases of monochorionic dizygotic twins since 2003. These cases suggest that monochorionic dizygotic twins are not as rare as previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Dermatoglyphic asymmetry and diversity traits from a large number of twins (MZ and DZ) were analyzed based on principal factors to evaluate genetic effects and common familial environmental influences on twin data by the use of maximum likelihood-based Variance decomposition analysis. Sample consists of monozygotic (MZ) twins of two sexes (102 male pairs and 138 female pairs) and 120 pairs of dizygotic (DZ) female twins. All asymmetry (DA and FA) and diversity of dermatoglyphic traits were clearly separated into factors. These are perfectly corroborated with the earlier studies in different ethnic populations, which indicate a common biological validity perhaps exists of the underlying component structures of dermatoglyphic characters. Our heritability result in twins clearly showed that DA_F2 is inherited mostly in dominant type (28.0%) and FA_F1 is additive (60.7%), but no significant difference in sexes was observed for these factors. Inheritance is also very prominent in diversity Factor 1, which is exactly corroborated with our previous findings. The present results are similar with the earlier results of finger ridge count diversity in twin data, which suggested that finger ridge count diversity is under genetic control.",

    "abstract": "Body Mass Index (BMI) and skinfolds are common indicators of adiposity. Many studies have shown relationships between the BMI in childhood and adolescence and the BMI in adulthood. Similar correlations were observed for the skinfolds, although they tend to be lower. The aim of this study was to estimate changes with age in the genetic variance and heritability of the BMI and skinfolds among Polish twins born between 1959 and 1965. Observations involved male and female monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, who were measured annually between 8 and 18 years of age. Body Mass Index and skinfold thicknesses at the triceps (TSF), subscapular (SSF) and suprailiac (SIF) sites were measured. Genetic variance and heritability were estimated for individual skinfold thicknesses, the sum of three skinfolds (SUMSF) and BM, separately by age classes for both sexes. Intraclass correlations were significantly higher for MZ twins than for DZ twins in both sexes and across all ages. Heritability estimates were significant for all indicators of adiposity, but varied with age and had different ranges for boys and girls. Estimates of genetic variance were significant for all indicators of adiposity and were higher for girls than for boys.",

    "abstract": "Parenting has been extensively studied but mostly as a causal factor influencing child outcomes. The aim of the current article is to examine the child's side of the relationship by meta-analyzing studies which used quantitative genetic methods that provide leverage in understanding causality. A meta-analysis of 32 children-as-twins studies of parenting revealed a heritability estimate of 23%, thus indicating that genetically influenced behaviors of the child affect and shape parental behavior. The shared- and nonshared-environmental estimates, which amounted to 43% and 34%, respectively, indicate not only substantial consistency in parental behavior but also differential treatment within the family. Assessment method, age, and parenting dimension were found to be significant moderators of these influences. Our findings stress the importance of accounting for genotype-environment correlations in child-development studies and call into question previous research that interpreted correlational results in unidirectional terms with parenting as the sole causal factor.",

    "abstract": "Low birth weight and low 5-min Apgar scores have been associated with developmental delay, while older maternal age is a protective factor. Little is known about trajectories and predictors of developmental skills in infant twins, who are generally born with lower birth weights, lower Apgar scores and to older mothers.\nDevelopmental skills were assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months using the Ages and Stages Questionnaires in 152 twins from the Birmingham Registry for Twin and Heritability Studies. Multilevel spline and linear regression models (adjusted for gestational age, gender, maternal age) were used to estimate developmental trajectories and the associations between birth weight, maternal age and Apgar scores on developmental skills.\nTwins performed worse than singletons on communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving and personal-social skills (p < 0.001). Twins caught up around 6 months (score within -1 standard deviation of norm), except on gross motor skills, which did not catch up until after the age of 12 months. A one-year increase in maternal age was significantly associated with decreases in gross motor and personal-social z-scores of up to -0.09, whereas one unit increases in Apgar score increased z-scores up to 0.90 (p < 0.01).\nHealthy twins should be considered at a higher risk for developmental delay. Whether these results are comparable to preterm singletons, or whether there are twin-specific issues involved, should be further investigated in a study that uses a matched singleton control group.",

    "abstract": "Smaller studies and many case series reports indicate that congenital heart defects may be more common in monochorionic twins than in dichorionic twins and singletons.\nWe investigated congenital heart defect occurrence in all twins and 5% of all singletons born in Denmark in 1977-2001 and followed through 2006 by linking the Danish Twin Registry and Statistics Denmark registers including the National Medical Birth Register and the Danish National Patient Register. Among 41 525 twin individuals, a total of 584 twins (1.4%) had a congenital heart defect registered in the Danish National Patient Register, whereas the corresponding numbers for singletons were 648 of 74 473 (0.87%; P<0.001; ie, a 63% [95% confidence interval, 45-82%] increased risk for congenital heart defect for twins). Patent ductus arteriosus and coarctation of aorta occurred >3 times as often in twins as in singletons, at 3.9 (95% confidence interval, 2.6-5.8) and 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.5-6.4), respectively. The increased occurrence in twins was also found in sensitivity analyses including only inpatients or only surgically treated cases regardless of whether preterm patent ductus arteriosus was included. We were not able to demonstrate a higher risk for congenital heart defect among monozygotic twins compared with dizygotic twins, and the congenital heart defect occurrence was also increased in dizygotic twins, who are all dichorionic.\nCongenital heart defect is more common in twins than in singletons, and the increased occurrence is not restricted to monochorionic twins. Intrauterine surveillance and a postnatal comprehensive cardiac assessment for both twins may be considered regardless of chorionicity and zygosity.",

    "abstract": "Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of Langerhans cells accompanying eosinophils. It often attacks children under 10 years of age. LCH in identical twins is very rare and its prognosis is different. Here we report identical-twin sisters with LCH. Computed tomography (CT) revealed osteolytic change in each twin's skull, and the elder exhibited poor eyesight. There were massive histiocyte-like cells surrounded by eosinophils in pathologic specimen of the abnormal lesions, which is typical pathologic finding in LCH. These pathologic cells were positive for S-100 and the cell surface protein CD1 antigen (CD1\u03b1), the known markers of LCH. After treating them with surgery, no symptoms were seen in the younger until now. While the older was found another soft mass (about 2.0 cm in diameter) in the left temporal area 18 months later. The same treatment was given to the older after admission, and she is healthy to date. To explore the relationship between hallmarks and the prognosis of identical-twin patients with LCH, we retrieved the 16 literatures (16 identical-twin pairs, 31 patients) listed in PubMed during the past 60 years. The data revealed all those patients who have disseminated to the bone marrow, spleen and liver with symptoms of fever and hepatosplenomegaly exhibited worse prognosis (9 out of the 31 patients). The other identical-twin subjects without infiltration of those organs recovered well. In conclusion, this study reveals the adverse hallmarks of prognosis in identical-twin patients with LCH by reviewing relevant literatures.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify the specific components of facial aging secondary to smoking, by comparing standardized photographs of identical twins with different smoking histories.\nDuring the Twins Days Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, from 2007 to 2010, 79 pairs of twins were identified, in which only one twin smokes or where one twin smoked at least 5 years longer than his or her counterpart. Questionnaires were obtained and standardized photographs were taken by professional photographers. A panel of three blinded judges analyzed the twins' facial features and graded wrinkles using the validated Lemperle Assessment Scale, and ranked age-related facial features on a four-point scale.\nSmoking twins compared with their nonsmoking counterparts had worse scores for upper eyelid skin redundancy, lower lid bags, malar bags, nasolabial folds, upper lip wrinkles, lower lip vermillion wrinkles, and jowls. Lower lid hyperpigmentation in the smoking group fell just short of statistical significance. Transverse forehead wrinkles, glabellar wrinkles, crow's feet, and lower lip lines accentuated by puckering did not have a statistically significant differences in scores. Among twins with greater than 5 years' difference in smoking duration, twins who had smoked longer had worse scores for lower lid bags, malar bags, and lower lip vermillion wrinkles.\nThis study details the specifics of facial aging brought on by smoking, which primarily affects the middle and lower thirds of the face. It also demonstrates that a 5-year difference in smoking history can cause noticeable differences in facial aging in twins.\nRisk, II.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic events are crucial for early development, but can be influenced by environmental factors, potentially programming the genome for later adverse health outcomes. The insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)/H19 locus is crucial for prenatal growth and the epigenetic state at this locus is environmentally labile. Recent studies have implicated maternal factors, including folate intake and smoking, in the regulation of DNA methylation at this locus, although data are often conflicting in the direction and magnitude of effect. Most studies have focused on single tissues and on one or two differentially-methylated regions (DMRs) regulating IGF2/H19 expression. In this study, we investigated the relationship between multiple shared and non-shared gestational/maternal factors and DNA methylation at four IGF2/H19 DMRs in five newborn cell types from 67 pairs of monozygotic and 49 pairs of dizygotic twins. Data on maternal and non-shared supply line factors were collected during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and DNA methylation was measured via mass spectrometry using Sequenom MassArray EpiTyper analysis. Our exploratory approach showed that the site of umbilical cord insertion into the placenta in monochorionic twins has the strongest positive association with methylation in all IGF2/H19 DMRs (p<0.05). Further, evidence for tissue- and locus-specific effects were observed, emphasizing that responsiveness to environmental exposures in utero cannot be generalized across genes and tissues, potentially accounting for the lack of consistency in previous findings. Such complexity in responsiveness to environmental exposures in utero has implications for all epigenetic studies investigating the developmental origins of health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Classically derived estimates of heritability from twin models have been plagued by the possibility of genetic-environmental covariance. Survey questions that attempt to measure directly the extent to which more genetically similar kin (such as monozygotic twins) also share more similar environmental conditions represent poor attempts to gauge a complex underlying phenomenon of GE-covariance. The present study exploits a natural experiment to address this issue: Self-misperception of twin zygosity in the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Such twins were reared under one \"environmental regime of similarity\" while genetically belonging to another group, reversing the typical GE-covariance and allowing bounded estimates of heritability for a range of outcomes. In addition, we examine twins who were initially misclassified by survey assignment--a stricter standard--in three datasets: Add Health, the Minnesota Twin Family Study and the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden. Results are similar across approaches and datasets and largely support the validity of the equal environments assumption.",

    "abstract": "A paradigm shift from hard to flexible, organic-based optoelectronics requires fast and reversible mechanical response from actuating materials that are used for conversion of heat or light into mechanical motion. As the limits in the response times of polymer-based actuating materials are reached, which are inherent to the less-than-optimal coupling between the light/heat and mechanical energy in them, a conceptually new approach to mechanical actuation is required to leapfrog the performance of organic actuators. Herein, we explore single crystals of 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene (TBB) as actuating elements and establish relations between their kinematic profile and mechanical properties. Centimeter-size acicular crystals of TBB are the only naturally twinned crystals out of about a dozen known materials that exhibit the thermosalient effect-an extremely rare and visually impressive crystal locomotion. When taken over a phase transition, crystals of this material store mechanical strain and are rapidly self-actuated to sudden jumps to release the internal strain, leaping up to several centimeters. To establish the structural basis for this colossal crystal motility, we investigated the mechanical profile of the crystals from macroscale, in response to externally induced deformation under microscope, to nanoscale, by using nanoindentation. Kinematic analysis based on high-speed recordings of over 200 twinned TBB crystals exposed to directional or nondirectional heating unraveled that the crystal locomotion is a kinematically complex phenomenon that includes at least six kinematic effects. The nanoscale tests confirm the highly elastic nature, with an elastic deformation recovery (60%) that is far superior to those of molecular crystals reported earlier. This property appears to be critical for accumulation of stress required for crystal jumping. Twinned crystals of TBB exposed to moderate directional heating behave as all-organic analogue of a bimetallic strip, where the lattice misfit between the two crystal components drives reversible deformation of the crystal.",

    "abstract": "To examine the relationship between adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and health perception in adulthood, and to explore the contribution of shared familial factors to these associations. Data were collected from 180 female twins (90 pairs) from the community-based University of Washington Twin Registry. Participants completed questionnaires including the modified ACE Questionnaire, Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire, McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form, and the SF-36. Mixed effects linear regression modeling investigated the effects of ACE on indices of health perception controlling for correlated twin data. Additional models examined the associations while controlling for the experience of physical and/or sexual abuse in childhood; within-twin pair models that inherently adjust for familial factors explored shared familial influences. After controlling for relevant demographic variables, more ACE was associated with worse perceptions of general health (p=.01) and vitality (p=.05) on the SF-36. After controlling for childhood physical and/or sexual abuse, the relationship between ACE and general health remained significant (p=.01) while vitality was no longer significant. None of the associations remained significant after accounting for the influence of familial factors. These results support previous findings on the negative link between ACE and perceived health in adulthood. The detrimental effects of ACE on vitality may be accounted for by the experience of childhood physical and/or sexual abuse. Shared familial factors might play a partial role in the relationship between ACE and health perception. Future research should further investigate the genetic and environmental mechanisms that may explain this relationship.",

    "abstract": "Twins have inconsistently shown poorer outcomes than singletons. Although a high proportion of twins are born very preterm, data are sparse on the long-term outcomes in very preterm twins. The objective of this study was to compare mortality and neurodevelopmental outcomes of very preterm singletons and twins and to study outcomes in relation to factors specific to twins.\nBirth cohort study Etude Epidemiologique sur les Petits Ages Gestationnels (EPIPAGE).\nNine regions in France.\nAll very preterm live births occurring from 22 to 32 weeks of gestation in all maternity wards of nine French regions in 1997 (n=2773).\nNeurodevelopmental status, including cerebral palsy, and a cognitive assessment with the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, with scores on the Mental Processing Composite (MPC) scale, was available for 1732 and 1473 children at 5 years of age, respectively.\nAmong live births, twins had higher hospital mortality than singletons (adjusted (a)OR: 1.4 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.9)). Among survivors, there was no crude difference at 5 years between twins and singletons in the prevalence of cerebral palsy (8.0% vs 9.1%, respectively), MPC <70 (9.5% vs 11.1%) and mean MPC (94.6 vs 94.4). However, after adjustment for sex, gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction and social factors, twins were more likely to have lower MPC scores (mean difference: -2.4 (95% CI-4.8 to 0.01)). Live born twins had a higher risk of mortality when birth weight discordance was present (aOR:2.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 4.8)), but there were no differences in long-term outcomes.\nCompared with very preterm singletons, twins had higher mortality, no difference with respect to severe deficiencies, but slightly lower MPC scores at 5 years.",

    "abstract": "Prepubertal gynecomastia is characterized by the presence of palpable uni- or bilateral breast tissue in boys without other signs of sexual maturation. It may be the endocrine expression of rare syndromes such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of anastrozole and to describe an innovative surgical approach.\nThis report presents twins with PJS, bilateral prepubertal gynecomastia, and testicular multifocal calcifications. Both twins were treated with anastrozole for 2 years. After finishing treatment, both were followed before subcutaneous mastectomy was performed by the \"modified\" Webster technique.\nGrowth velocity decreased and gynecomastia diminished during anastrozole treatment. After discontinuation of therapy due to a sharp reduction in growth velocity, both twins showed regrowth of gynecomastia, with painful and strained breasts. A significant reduction in breast volume with glandular removal was achieved.\nThe findings of this study showed a multidisciplinary approach to prepubertal gynecomastia due to the synergy of pediatricians, radiologists, and plastic surgeons. The follow-up evaluation after the anastrozole treatment showed it to be an efficacious medical treatment, as an alternative to orchidectomy, to control the effects of circulating estrogens. Moreover, the results observed in the patients confirmed the validity and feasibility of the \"modified\" Webster technique in terms of aesthetic and functional results, patient satisfaction, and absence of complications.",

    "abstract": "To find the longitudinal genetic effects on mandibular position in mixed dentition.\nThe sample used in this study consisted of lateral cephalograms of eighty-nine pairs of female twins in Beijing. With a mixed longitudinal method, the effective twins were 183 pairs(monozygous 110 pairs and dizygous 73 ones). The genetic and environmental effects on mandibular position were analyzed by statistical methods in female twins from six to twelve years old.\nStatistical comparisons revealed significant (P<0.05) environmental effects on the angles(ArGo'Me, SArGo', SN-MP, FH-MP, PP-MP), the depths(L1, L2, L3), and the heights(H1, H3) of mandibular, whilst genetic effects on the angle(NSAr) and the heights(H1, H2, H3, H4)(P<0.05); and family inheritance effects can be founded in the angles(ArGo'Me, SN-MP, NSGn, SGn-FH)(P<0.05).\nThe effect of inheritance on mandibular position is strong, while environmental impact is relatively weak. Stronger genetic influence on heights is shown than that on depths. The environmental influence on depths and heights is different. Using Ba as a reference, the depth of the chin is the most subjective to environment change, then the mandibular angle, and the condyle is the least. Using N and S as references, the environmental influence on heights showed different order from the most to least changeable: The mandibular angle, the condyle and the chin. In later stage of our observation, the mandibular morphology and growth type might be family inherited. For environmental influences plays important roles on mandibular position, these findings can be used in orthodontic treatment planning.",

    "abstract": "Discordant chromosomal anomalies in monozygotic twins may be caused by various timing issues of erroneous mitosis and twinning events. Here, we report a prenatal diagnosis of heterokaryotypic monozygotic twins discordant for phenotype. In a 28-year-old woman, ultrasound examination performed at 26 weeks of gestation, detected intrauterine growth restriction and unilateral cleft lip and palate in twin B, whereas twin A had normal fluid, growth and anatomy. Molecular karyotyping in twin B identified a 18q21.2qter deletion, further confirmed by FISH analysis on amniocytes. Interestingly, in twin A, cytogenetic studies (FISH analysis and karyotype) on amniocytes were normal. Genotyping with microsatellite markers confirmed the monozygosity of the twins. At 32 weeks of gestation, selective termination of twin B was performed by umbilical cord coagulation and fetal blood samples were taken from the umbilical cord in both twins. FISH analyses detected mosaicism in both twins with 75% of cells being normal and 25% harboring the 18qter deletion. After genetic counseling, the parents elected to terminate the second twin at 36 weeks of gestation. In postmortem studies, FISH analyses revealed mosaicism on several tissues in both twins. Taking into account this observation, we discuss the difficulties of genetic counseling and management concerning heterokaryotypic monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "To estimate the risk of stillbirth in dichorionic and monochorionic twins compared with singletons, and to evaluate the relevant causes of stillbirth in each group.\nA retrospective cohort analysis of all pregnancies \u226522 weeks of gestation was performed at a tertiary care center from January 1995 to June 2011. The overall fetal survival and the prospective risk of stillbirth were compared in monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins, dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twins, and singletons. Causes of stillbirth were classified using the ReCoDe classification and were compared among the three study groups.\nA total of 46,200 singletons, 462 MCDA twins and 1108 DCDA twins were included in the study. Both Kaplan-Meier analysis and prospective risk calculation showed that MCDA twins had the highest risk of stillbirth (OR ranging between 13.5 95% CI 8.7-20.7 at 22.0-24.6 weeks and 4.0 95% CI 1.1-13.1 at 31.0-33.6 weeks, compared to singletons), while singletons had the lowest. Main causes of stillbirth were major congenital malformations in singletons (25.1%) and in DCDA twins (75%), and twin-twin transfusion syndrome in MCDA twins (81.5%). When excluding fetuses affected by major congenital anomalies, MCDA twins (p<0.001) but not DCDA twins (p=0.2) remained at increased risk for stillbirth compared with singletons.\nThe risk of stillbirth is significantly higher both in MCDA and DCDA twins compared with singletons. Stillbirths are mainly due to twin-twin transfusion syndrome in MCDA twins and major congenital anomalies in DCDA twins. When major congenital anomalies are excluded, DCDA twins have a similar in utero mortality to singletons.",

We describe a case of thoraco-omphalopagus asymmetric conjoined twins in which the autosite had an associated large-diameter omphalocoele that was successfully separated at our institution. Reconstruction of the resulting abdominal-wall defect was performed using a flap from the gluteal region and the proximal portion of the inferior limb of the parasite, which is demonstrated. In addition, a review of all previously published cases is presented, showing that overall positive results can be obtained in treating this condition and that the presence and degree of cardiac involvement have a major influence on the prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Genetic mechanisms are already predominant during embryonic craniofacial morphogenesis, but environment is also thought to influence dentofacial morphology postnatally, particularly during facial growth. A better understanding of the relative effects of genes and environment on dentofacial and occlusal parameters should improve our knowledge on the etiology of orthodontic disorders and therefore also on the possibilities and limitations of the orthodontic treatment and treatment planning. The aim of the present study is to explore the genetic and environmental influence on craniofacial dimensions in a group of 19 pairs of twins using the twin study method. The twin study carried out here clearly indicates that craniofacial matrix is under substantial genetic control and the redirection of a basic growth pattern may be modified only within biological limits which are harmonious for the patient.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of a single course of antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) therapy on the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm twins according to the time interval between ACS administration and delivery.\nWe performed a retrospective cohort study of twins born between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation from November 1995 to May 2011. Subjects were grouped on the basis of the time interval between the first ACS dose and delivery: the ACS-to-delivery interval of less than 2 days (n = 166), 2-7 days (n = 114), and more than 7 days (n = 66). Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes of each group were compared with a control group of twins who were not exposed to ACS (n = 122). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between the ACS-to-delivery interval and the incidence of RDS after adjusting for potential confounding variables.\nCompared with the ACS nonexposure group, the incidence of RDS in the group with an ACS-to-delivery interval of less than 2 days was not significantly different (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.089; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.524-2.262; P = .819). RDS occurred significantly less frequently when the ACS-to-delivery interval was between 2 and 7 days (aOR, 0.419; 95% CI, 0.181-0.968; P = .042). However, there was no significant reduction in the incidence of RDS when the ACS-to-delivery interval exceeded 7 days (aOR, 2.205; 95% CI, 0.773-6.292; P = .139).\nIn twin pregnancies, a single course of ACS treatment was associated with a decreased rate of RDS only when the ACS-to-delivery interval was between 2 and 7 days.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is common during adolescence and young adulthood and is associated with poor quality of life, depression, and functional disability. Recognizing that chronic pain has significant consequences, it is important to identify modifiable health behaviors that may place young adults at risk for chronic pain. This study examines associations between chronic musculoskeletal pain and smoking in young adult twins (n = 1,588, ages 18-30) participating in a statewide twin registry. Twins completed questionnaires assessing smoking, mood (anxiety, depressive symptoms, and stress), and chronic musculoskeletal pain. Analyses examined associations between chronic pain and smoking, particularly the role of genetics/shared familial factors and psychological symptoms. As predicted, results revealed a near-2-fold increased risk for chronic musculoskeletal pain in twins who currently smoked compared to nonsmokers, even when accounting for psychological factors. Results of within-pair analyses were only minimally attenuated, suggesting that associations between smoking and chronic musculoskeletal pain are better accounted for by nonshared factors than by shared familial factors/genetic effects. Future twin research is needed to identify what nonshared factors (eg, attitudes, direct effects of smoking on pain) contribute to these associations to further understand comorbidity. Longitudinal studies and recruitment of participants prior to smoking initiation and chronic pain onset will better identify causal associations.\nThis article describes associations between musculoskeletal pain and smoking in young adult twins, taking into account psychological symptoms. Findings highlight the importance of nonshared factors in associations between pain and smoking and the need to explore the roles of lifestyle, individual attitudes, and direct effects of smoking on pain.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (identical) twins have been widely used in genetic studies to determine the relative contributions of heredity and the environment in human diseases. Discordance in disease manifestation between affected monozygotic twins has been attributed to either environmental factors or different patterns of X chromosome inactivation (XCI). However, recent studies have identified genetic and epigenetic differences between monozygotic twins, thereby challenging the accepted experimental model for distinguishing the effects of nature and nurture. Here, we report the genomic and epigenomic sequences in skin fibroblasts of a discordant monozygotic twin pair with Rett syndrome, an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by autistic features, epileptic seizures, gait ataxia and stereotypical hand movements. The twins shared the same de novo mutation in exon 4 of the MECP2 gene (G269AfsX288), which was paternal in origin and occurred during spermatogenesis. The XCI patterns in the twins did not differ in lymphocytes, skin fibroblasts, and hair cells (which originate from ectoderm as does neuronal tissue). No reproducible differences were detected between the twins in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels), or copy number variations. Differences in DNA methylation between the twins were detected in fibroblasts in the upstream regions of genes involved in brain function and skeletal tissues such as Mohawk Homeobox (MKX), Brain-type Creatine Kinase (CKB), and FYN Tyrosine Kinase Protooncogene (FYN). The level of methylation in these upstream regions was inversely correlated with the level of gene expression. Thus, differences in DNA methylation patterns likely underlie the discordance in Rett phenotypes between the twins.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to singletons, twins born to older mothers have lower rates of perinatal mortality than twins born to younger mothers. We examined whether differences in chorionicity could explain this unexpected maternal age effect.\nWe used population-based data on twins born to mothers aged 20-29 (n\u00a0= 3702) and \u226535\u00a0years (n\u00a0= 1880) in the North of England, UK, 1998-2007. We calculated rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate the effect of maternal age; adjusted RRs (ARRs) were estimated by the use of generalized estimating equations for Poisson regression controlling for chorionicity and other confounders.\nOlder mothers had a lower proportion of monochorionic twins (17.6% vs. 24.3%, P < .01); lower\u00a0neonatal (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34-0.95) and perinatal mortality (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.53-1.04). Adjustment for chorionicity attenuated these associations (ARR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35-0.98 and ARR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.57-1.12, respectively) and after further adjustment for additional factors, both associations became nonsignificant. Older mothers had greater rates of small-for-gestational-age infants (ARR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.24-2.05), and cesarean delivery (ARR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.16-1.48).\nPerinatal death rates were lower but not statistically different for twins born to older versus younger mothers. This association was attenuated by adjustment for chorionicity.",

    "abstract": "A 30-years-old Taiwanese female in her second pregnancy spontaneously conceived a monochorionic twin pregnancy. A routine ultrasound at 27 weeks of gestation revealed a selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) fetus and an appropriate gestational age (AGA) fetus. The AGA fetus was found to have a fetal intra-abdominal umbilical vein (FIUV) varix. Serial ultrasounds showed no changes in the FIUV varix. 2 weeks later, the pregnancy progressed to twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Repeated amnioreductions were required at 29 and 30 weeks gestation. The babies were delivered by caesarean section at 31 weeks due to fetal distress in the sIUGR fetus. Both fetuses survived the neonatal period with problems of prematurity. The FIUV varix disappeared a few days after delivery.",

    "abstract": "Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a rare congenital defect of autosomal dominant inheritance, primarily affecting bones that undergo intra-membranous ossification. Herein is reported the case of monozygotic male 13-year-old twins with typical features of this syndrome, such as large wide-open fontanels, abnormal clavicles with narrow, sloping shoulders that can be apposed at the midline, short stature, mid-face hypoplasia, multiple supernumerary teeth, and skeletal anomalies. Their physical appearance led to the diagnosis of CCD. Genetic analysis found a C-T exchange in exon 2 at cDNA position 568, which changes the codon CGG for arginine to TGG for tryptophan (R190W) of the runt-related transcription factor 2 RUNX2 gene. CCD should be suspected in patients with persistence of the widely open anterior fontanels and sutures, short stature, and poor clavicles, calvarium, or teeth. Timely recognition and hereditary tendency counseling is required and useful because of the possibility of covert transmissibility and sporadic genetic mutation.",

    "abstract": "We report a monochorionic diamniotic twin pair born at 29 weeks of gestation in which both twins developed severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with retinal detachment. The pregnancy was terminated due to reversal of donor-recipient phenotypes in possible TTTS. Both twins had unstable cardiopulmonary status during the first week, and developed chronic lung disease. The larger twin, born at 1372 g, developed stage 4a ROP in both eyes, and the smaller twin, born at 1168 g, developed stage 4a ROP in the left eye. Genetic analysis of NDP, FZD4, LRP5, TSPAN12 genes revealed no mutations; however, VEGF gene polymorphism analysis showed heterozygous carrier state of the VEGF 936T allele in both twins, which is a risk factor for threshold ROP in Japanese newborn infants. We speculate the synergistic effects of unstable perinatal cardiopulmonary status and genetic predisposition due to VEGF 936C>T polymorphism caused the development of severe ROP with retinal detachment.",

Dizygotic twins are more influenced by parents (70%) than monozygotics (31-36%). If the twin or non-twin sibling does not smoke, the risk that the twin individual starts smoking, is decreased by 86% both in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. If an individual smoking is present in the fraternity and he or she does not attempt to quit, the risk of smoking increases 8.3-fold. The role of fraternity is more important in males and youth.\nThe parents' and the siblings' exemplary behaviour helps to avoid smoking initiation of young twins.\nBevezet\u00e9s: A doh\u00e1nyz\u00e1si szok\u00e1sokat k\u00f6rnyezeti t\u00e9nyez\u0151k (csal\u00e1d, bar\u00e1tok) \u00e9s pszich\u00e9s t\u00e9nyez\u0151k is alak\u00edtj\u00e1k.

    "abstract": "Monochorionic dizygous twins are probably more frequent than considered previously as many cases remain unrecognized, especially when the children have the same sex. Here we present a pair of dizygous, sex-discordant monochorionic twins who were conceived after artificial insemination. Histological examination of the placenta and extensive genetic studies of the healthy boy and girl clearly proved that they indeed were monochorionic dizygous twins with a fully joined blood circulation. We conclude that when counseling parents expecting monochorionic twins of discordant sex, not only a disorder of sexual differentiation in one of the twins should be addressed but also the possibility of dizygosity with a completely normal (sexual) development of both children.",

    "abstract": "Birth size curves are needed for clinical and epidemiological purposes. We constructed birth weight (BW), length (BL), and head circumference (BHC) references, assessed effects of twinness and parity, and defined cut-off points for small, appropriate, and large for gestational age.\nBirth register data of all 753,036 infants born in 1996-2008 in Finland were cleaned to create references reflecting optimal intrauterine growth. The final data included 533,666 singletons and 15,033 twins (median gestation weeks (gws) 40.0 and 37.1, respectively, 41.6% primiparous). Sex-specific BW, BL, and BHC references were constructed from 23 to 43 gws separately for singletons and twins born to primiparous or multiparous mothers. GAMLSS method was used for modelling.\nIn singletons from 36 gws onwards, increased BW and BL were observed in comparison to previous reference from 1979-1983. Twins diverged from singletons from 30 gws onwards. At 37.0 gws, mean BW was 400 g lower and mean BL 1.2 cm shorter than in singletons. From 30 gws onwards, birth size was larger in infants of multiparous than primiparous mothers.\nPopulation-based birth size references are available for the evaluation of birth size. Accounting for plurality and parity improves the accuracy of birth size evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a multifactorial disease. Twin studies comparing the disease concordance rate in identical twin pairs serve to differentiate the influence of genetic and environmental factors in the disease development.\nTo assess breast cancer risk for an identical twin sister of a patient with breast cancer.\nFive monozygotic twin families were examined during 2005-\u200a2011 in which at least one of the monozygotic sisters developed breast cancer.In 4 breast cancer women from 4 families, molecular genetic analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes was performed.\nThe median followup period was 12.6 years (7 to 24 years). No pair of monozygotic sisters was concordant for breast cancer. Familial breast/\u200aovarian cancer syndrome due to BRCA1 gene mutation was confirmed in one pair. These twins were phenotypically discordant, the first one developing breast cancer at the age of 54 years, her co\u200asister suffering from ovarian cancer at the age of 43 years. In the other 4 nonBRCA families, breast cancer was diagnosed at the age of 38-\u200a50 years (median 44 years) in one of the sisters; the other twins remain healthy through the followup period.\nWe did not observe concordance for breast cancer in 5 pairs of monozygotic twins. Based on results of published studies, the life\u200a time breast cancer risk for a healthy identical twin of a breast cancer nonBRCA woman is around 20-\u200a30 %. Other nonhereditary risk factors must exist to explain the discordant phenotype. This highlights that environmental factors play an important role in breast cancer development. In case of BRCA associated breast cancer, breast cancer risk for the healthy co\u200atwin is the same as that for other BRCA mutation carriers, i.e. 45-\u200a85%.",

    "abstract": "This is the first report in the literature of a sole regional anesthetic for adult craniopagus twins using a supraclavicular block for an elbow incision and drainage/bursa excision procedure. It demonstrates that for these complex medical patients, a total regional anesthesia technique is preferable when possible. There are several known general anesthetic complications in these patients. Anesthetic crossover between the twins can occur and may be variable; furthermore, the incidence and severity of the crossover effects of different anesthetics vary. Positioning of the twins can be difficult with both regional and general anesthesia. However, with regional anesthesia, the twins can position themselves and report any discomfort, which could go unnoticed under general anesthesia, leading to other complications. Craniopagus twins have a high likelihood of a difficult airway due to anatomy or positioning difficulties, which is avoided by regional anesthesia. This case emphasizes the unique challenges that these patients pose and the ability of regional anesthesia to help avoid the pitfalls of general anesthesia in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) affects 15% of monochorionic diamniotic (MD) twin pregnancies, and is associated with adverse perinatal outcome. Recently, fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (FLP) has been widely accepted as the most definitive therapy to treat TTTS. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a powerful diagnostic marker of cardiac dysfunction in neonates, and is elevated in MD twins with TTTS. However, there are no reports assessing the effect of FLP on neonatal cardiac overload in TTTS by measuring the serum NT-proBNP levels at birth. Here, we aimed to compare serum NT-proBNP levels at birth in MD twins with TTTS treated with FLP or not. Twelve MD twin pairs with TTTS admitted to our center between October 2007 and September 2012 were enrolled in this study. The MD twin pairs were separated into two groups: seven twins (12 newborn infants) with FLP (FLP group) and five twins (nine newborn infants) without FLP (non-FLP group). Gestational age, birthweight, and Apgar scores were significantly higher in the FLP group than that in the non-FLP group. Serum NT-proBNP levels at birth were significantly lower in the FLP group than in the non-FLP group [1425 pg/ml (range, 466-9560) vs. 29900 pg/ml (range, 7300-77900), respectively; p=0.0003]. The serum NT-proBNP levels of larger and smaller co-twins were significantly correlated with each other (r=0.750; p=0.026). In conclusion, serum NT-proBNP levels at birth are lower in MD twins with TTTS after FLP treatment than in those without FLP.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) has focused on the influence of genetic variation and environmental risk factors. Growing evidence suggests the additional role of epigenetic mechanisms influencing susceptibility for complex traits. DNA sequence within discordant monozygotic twin (MZT) pairs is virtually identical; thus, they represent a powerful design for studying the contribution of epigenetic factors to disease liability. The aim of this study was to investigate whether specific methylation profiles in white blood cells could contribute to the aetiology of MDD. Participants were drawn from the Queensland Twin Registry and comprised 12 MZT pairs discordant for MDD and 12 MZT pairs concordant for no MDD and low neuroticism. Bisulphite treatment and genome-wide interrogation of differentially methylated CpG sites using the Illumina Human Methylation 450 BeadChip were performed in WBC-derived DNA. No overall difference in mean global methylation between cases and their unaffected co-twins was found; however, the differences in females was significant (P=0.005). The difference in variance across all probes between affected and unaffected twins was highly significant (P<2.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076), with 52.4% of probes having higher variance in cases (binomial P-value<2.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076). No significant differences in methylation were observed between discordant MZT pairs and their matched concordant MZT (permutation minimum P=0.11) at any individual probe. Larger samples are likely to be needed to identify true associations between methylation differences at specific CpG sites.",

    "abstract": "Although exclusion from the workforce due to long-term sick leave (LTSL) and disability pension (DP) is a major problem in many Western countries, the etiology of LTSL and DP is not well understood. These phenomena have a strong association as most patients receiving DP have first been on LTSL. However, only a few of those on LTSL end up with DP. The present study aimed to investigate the common and specific genetic and environmental risk factors for LTSL and DP. The present study utilizes a population-based sample of 7,710 young adult twins from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health Twin Panel, which has been linked to the Historical-Event Database (FD-Trygd; 1998-2008). Univariate and bivariate twin models were fitted to determine to what degree genetic and environmental factors contribute to variation in LTSL and DP. The estimated heritabilities of LTSL and DP were 0.49 and 0.66, respectively. There was no evidence for shared environmental or sex-specific factors. The phenotypic-, genetic-, and non-familial environmental correlations between the variables were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.94, respectively. Our results indicate that familial transmission of LTSL and DP is due to genetic and not environmental factors. The risk factors contributing to LTSL and DP were mainly shared, suggesting that what increases risk for LTSL also increases risk for DP. However, a non-negligible part of the genetic variance was not shared between the variables, which may contribute to explaining why some progress from LTSL to DP, whereas others return to work.",

    "abstract": "Impaired sleep patterns are known to be associated with many chronic conditions and ultimately they may lead to permanent work incapacity. Less is known about the associations between sleep patterns and cause-specific disability pensions, such as low back diagnoses, or whether familial factors (genetics and family environment) can affect the associations. The objective of this study was to investigate sleep patterns as predictors of disability pension due to low back diagnoses with a 23-year follow-up.\nA prospective cohort study with comprehensive mailed questionnaires about sleep patterns, e.g., quality and length of sleep in 1975 and 1981. Follow-up from the national disability pension register data until 2004.\nNot applicable.\nThere were 18,979 individuals (7,722 complete twin pairs) born before 1958.\nCox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Disability pension due to low back diagnoses had been granted to 467 individuals during the follow-up. Sleeping moderately well (HR 1.25; 95% CI 1.02, 1.53), or fairly poorly/poorly (HR 2.05; 95% CI 1.53, 2.73) at baseline predicted a significantly higher risk for disability pension. Stable patterns of sleeping either fairly well (HR 1.29; 95% CI 1.01, 1.64), or stably fairly poorly/poorly (HR 2.29; 95% CI 1.49, 3.52) between 1975 and 1981 were associated with a higher risk as compared to a stable pattern of sleeping well. Furthermore, a decrease in quality of sleep from 1975 to 1981 was associated (HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.03, 1.76) with an increased risk of disability pension.\nSleep quality and changes in sleep quality appear to be early predictors for disability pension due to low back diagnoses independently from other confounding factors.",

    "abstract": "We present a case of hematopoietic chimerism in dizygotic twins (male and female) conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF). At 8 years of age a blood karyotype was performed on the female due to the presence of clitoromegaly. Two different lines: 46,XX (53%) and 46,XY (47%) were found. FISH studies confirmed the presence of the SRY gene in 46,XY cells. Karyotyping of the male showed two different lines: 46,XY (58%) and 46,XX (42%). SRY gene was present in 46,XY cells. Microsatellite analyses of blood DNA revealed tetra-allelic contribution at some autosomal loci with similar proportions of maternal and paternal alleles and X/Y chromosome dose. FISH in buccal mucous showed that all cells from the female were 46,XX and those from the male 46,XY. The gonadal karyotype in the female was 46,XX without SRY. Hence, we report 46,XX/46,XY chimerism in dizygotic twins. Blood chimerism was confirmed by performing FISH on the buccal cells of the patients.",

There were no statistically significant differences between MZ and DZ twins in the prevalence of MS, LB, and enamel hypoplasia. Concordance rates for MS and LB presence and prevalence of enamel defects within MZ and DZ twin pairs were not significantly different. There were more children with caries in DZ compared with MZ twins (18% vs 3%, P = 0.0029), most likely due to increased daily frequency of sugar consumption and less toothbrushing.\nConcordance data from MZ and DZ twins did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference in susceptibility for enamel defects and colonization of MS and LB.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are generally considered to be distinct illnesses. One piece of evidence supporting their distinctness is the rarity of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder occurring in monozygotic co\u2012twins.\nWe describe a well-characterized pair of African American, female, monozygotic twins assessed at 53 years of age.Case 1: Twin A developed psychotic symptoms at age 23. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with schizophrenia. Twin A was subsequently hospitalized several more times and was consistently diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia. At the time of assessment, Twin A was single, lived with her parents and attended a day program. Case 2: In contrast, Twin B worked in a professional career, married and raised a family. She remained well until age 48 when she developed a depressive disorder requiring medication treatment. Four years later, Twin B abruptly developed grandiose delusions and mood-congruent auditory hallucinations. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with a manic episode. Since then Twin B has remained symptom-free on the mood stabilizer sodium valproate.\nSchizophrenia and bipolar disorder can occur in identical co-twins. We speculate on what it tells us about the meaning of discordance and the putative role of de novo mutations.",

    "abstract": "Differences in lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and peristaltic function and in transient LES relaxations (TLESR) have been described in patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, some of these differences may be the result of chronic GERD rather than being an underlying contributory factor.\nTwins discordant for GERD symptoms, i.e., only one twin had GERD symptoms, underwent standard LES and esophageal body manometry, and then using a sleeve sensor prolonged LES and pH monitoring, 30 min before and 60 min after a 250 mL 1200 kcal lipid meal.\nEight monozygotic and 24 dizygotic female twins were studied. Although there was no difference in preprandial LES pressure (symptomatic 13.2 \u00b1 7.1 mmHg vs asymptomatic 15.1 \u00b1 6.2 mmHg, P = 0.4), LES pressure fell further postprandially in symptomatic twins (LES pressure area under the curve 465 \u00b1 126 vs 331 \u00b1 141 mmHg h, P < 0.01). 12/37 (32%) of acid reflux episodes in symptomatic twins occurred due to low LES pressure or deep inspiration/strain and 0/17 in asymptomatic twins (P = 0.01). There was no difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic twins in: peristaltic amplitude, ineffective esophageal body motility, hiatus hernia prevalence, or LES length. There was also no difference in TLESR frequency preprandially (symptomatic median 1(range 0-2) vs asymptomatic 0(0-2), P = 0.08) or postprandially (2.5(1-8) vs 3(1-6), P = 0.81).\nTwins with GERD symptoms had lower postprandial LES pressure and given the close genetic link between the twins, it is possible that such differences are caused by GERD. Acid reflux episodes associated with a hypotensive LES were seen in symptomatic, but not in asymptomatic twins.",

    "abstract": "Low birth weight is associated with an increased adult metabolic disease risk. It is widely discussed that poor intra-uterine conditions could induce long-lasting epigenetic modifications, leading to systemic changes in regulation of metabolic genes. To address this, we acquire genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from saliva DNA in a unique cohort of 17 monozygotic monochorionic female twins very discordant for birth weight. We examine if adverse prenatal growth conditions experienced by the smaller co-twins lead to long-lasting DNA methylation changes.\nOverall, co-twins show very similar genome-wide DNA methylation profiles. Since observed differences are almost exclusively caused by variable cellular composition, an original marker-based adjustment strategy was developed to eliminate such variation at affected CpGs. Among adjusted and unchanged CpGs 3,153 are differentially methylated between the heavy and light co-twins at nominal significance, of which 45 show sensible absolute mean \u03b2-value differences. Deep bisulfite sequencing of eight such loci reveals that differences remain in the range of technical variation, arguing against a reproducible biological effect. Analysis of methylation in repetitive elements using methylation-dependent primer extension assays also indicates no significant intra-pair differences.\nSevere intra-uterine growth differences observed within these monozygotic twins are not associated with long-lasting DNA methylation differences in cells composing saliva, detectable with up-to-date technologies. Additionally, our results indicate that uneven cell type composition can lead to spurious results and should be addressed in epigenomic studies.",

    "results": "Overall, co-twins show very similar genome-wide DNA methylation profiles. Since observed differences are almost exclusively caused by variable cellular composition, an original marker-based adjustment strategy was developed to eliminate such variation at affected CpGs. Among adjusted and unchanged CpGs 3,153 are differentially methylated between the heavy and light co-twins at nominal significance, of which 45 show sensible absolute mean \u03b2-value differences. Deep bisulfite sequencing of eight such loci reveals that differences remain in the range of technical variation, arguing against a reproducible biological effect. Analysis of methylation in repetitive elements using methylation-dependent primer extension assays also indicates no significant intra-pair differences.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune thyroid diseases including Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis are caused by immune response to self-thyroid antigens. The rare situation of hyperthyroidism with Graves' disease in twins has been reported in a very few case reports in literature.\nWe present monozygotic female twins developing consecutively Graves' disease within five years. One year before the diagnosis of Graves' disease was established in the first twin, the mother developed a toxic thyroid nodule with hyperthyroidism leading to hemi thyroidectomy. Both the mother and the twins were cigarette smokers. The twins were treated with carbamizole and this therapy led to normalization of thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroxine.\nThis case report supports the hypothesis that a genetic factor as well as an environmental factor (cigarette smoking) might be of great importance in the aetiology of Graves' disease.",

    "abstract": "Chimerism occurs when an organism contains cells derived from more than one distinct zygote. We focus on monochorionic dizygotic twin blood chimerism, and particularly twin-twin transfusion syndrome in such pregnancies. For years, researchers have understood chimerism to be a common phenomenon in cattle. Although, this review will not delve deeply into animal chimerism, an understanding of chimerism in the animal world can provide clues regarding health implications for human chimeras. This report serves two purposes: an update and assessment of the twins we reported previously in 2010 [Assaf et al., 2010] and a review on dizygotic monochorionic chimeric twins. First, our updated assessment of the twins shows no identifiable regression of M\u00fcllerian sex derivatives in the female, and normal neurodevelopment was documented in both. Our research has suggested several key points; one that blood chimerism persists from fetal life to at least age two years. Second, chimerism in humans is not as rare as previously thought, although it has been studied only recently. Third, assisted reproductive technologies appear to increase the risk of monochorionic dizygotic twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Low birth weight (BW) has been associated with poor bone health in adulthood. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between BW and bone mass and metabolism in adult BW-discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins. A total of 153 BW-extremely discordant MZ twin pairs were recruited from the Danish Twin Registry. Serum vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25OHD]) and bone turnover markers (BTMs) amino-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (P1NP), pyridinoline cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (1CTP), and cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX) were quantified. Femoral neck (FN), total hip (TH), lumbar spine (LS), and whole-body (WB) bone mineral density (BMD) (ie, FN-BMD, TH-BMD, LS-BMD, and WB-BMD, respectively) were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Twins were studied as single individuals using regression analyses with or without adjustment for height, weight, age, sex, and intrapair correlation. Within-pair differences were assessed using Student's t test and fixed-regression models. BW was not associated with BTMs, LS-BMD, TH-BMD, FN-BMD, or WB-BMD, but BW was associated with WB-BMC, and WB-Area after adjustments. Compared to the co-twin, twins with the highest BW were heavier and taller in adulthood (mean differences \u00b1 SD): 3.0 \u00b1 10.5 kg; 1.6 \u00b1 2.6 cm; both p < 0.001). Within-pair analyses showed that LS-BMD, TH-BMD, and FN-BMD tended to be higher in twins with highest BW (for all: mean difference 0.01 \u00b1 0.1 g/cm(2) ; p = 0.08, 0.05, and 0.10, respectively). No difference was observed after adjustment for adult body size. Intrapair differences in BW were not associated with differences in any of the biochemical parameters or BMD. Small differences between twins in BMD were explained by dissimilarities in body size. These results suggest that BW and adult bone metabolism are unrelated.",

    "abstract": "To determine if glucose and insulin concentrations are regulated by cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) regardless of their genetic effects.\nThis cross-sectional study enrolled 38 pairs of young monozygotic twins (11 to 18 years-old). All subjects underwent a progressive maximal exercise test on a treadmill to determine the VO2max with gas exchange analysis (MedGraphics VO2000\u00ae - Medical Graphics Corp., St. Paul, MN). Blood samples were drawn after fasting to determine glucose and insulin levels. Monozygosity was confirmed by genotyping 15 informative genetic markers. Nine pairs had at least 10mL.kg-1.min-1 difference in VO2max and were divided into the more and less active group, according to their VO2max. Mean differences between more and less active groups were evaluated by Wilcoxon's test for paired data.\nOn average, twins from the more active group presented a 17% (13.5\u00b13.7mL.kg-1.min-1) higher VO2max compared to their less active siblings. No significant differences were observed between the groups for fasting insulin (36.5\u00b134.6 versus 25.3\u00b113.7mg/dL; p<0.813). However, the more active twins had lower fasting glucose than the less active ones (82.9\u00b17.3 versus 86.7\u00b17.6mg/dL; p<0.010).\nIn this case-control study (discordant monozygotic twins), the less active co-twins were characterized by higher fasting plasma glucose levels. This implies that poor cardiorespiratory fitness can be associated with defective glucose metabolism regardless of genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which development- and age-associated epigenetic changes are influenced by genetic, environmental and stochastic factors remains to be discovered. Twins provide an ideal model with which to investigate these influences but previous cross-sectional twin studies provide contradictory evidence of within-pair epigenetic drift over time. Longitudinal twin studies can potentially address this discrepancy.\nIn a pilot, genome-scale study of DNA from buccal epithelium, a relatively homogeneous tissue, we show that one-third of the CpGs assayed show dynamic methylation between birth and 18 months. Although all classes of annotated genomic regions assessed show an increase in DNA methylation over time, probes located in intragenic regions, enhancers and low-density CpG promoters are significantly over-represented, while CpG islands and high-CpG density promoters are depleted among the most dynamic probes. Comparison of co-twins demonstrated that within-pair drift in DNA methylation in our cohort is specific to a subset of pairs, who show more differences at 18 months. The rest of the pairs show either minimal change in methylation discordance, or more similar, converging methylation profiles at 18 months. As with age-associated regions, sites that change in their level of within-pair discordance between birth and 18 months are enriched in genes involved in development, but the average magnitude of change is smaller than for longitudinal change.\nOur findings suggest that DNA methylation in buccal epithelium is influenced by non-shared stochastic and environmental factors that could reflect a degree of epigenetic plasticity within an otherwise constrained developmental program.",

    "abstract": "The effects of acquired obesity on lipid profile and lipoprotein composition in rare BMI-discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs were studied.\nAbdominal fat distribution, liver fat (magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy), fasting serum lipid profile (ultracentrifugation, gradient gel-electrophoresis, and colorimetric enzymatic methods), and lifestyle factors (questionnaires and diaries) were assessed in 15 BMI-discordant (within-pair difference [\u0394] in BMI >3 kg/m2) and nin concordant (\u0394BMI <3 kg/m2) MZ twin pairs, identified from two nationwide cohorts of Finnish twins.\nDespite a strong similarity of MZ twins in lipid parameters (intra-class correlations 0.42-0.90, P < 0.05), concentrations of apolipoprotein B (ApoB), intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein 3a% (HDL3a%), and HDL3c% were higher (P < 0.05) and those of HDL cholesterol, HDL2-C, and HDL2b% were lower (P < 0.01) in the heavier co-twins of BMI-discordant pairs. The composition of lipoprotein particles was similar in the co-twins. When BMI-discordant pairs were further divided into liver fat-discordant and concordant (based on median for \u0394liver fat, 2.6%), the adverse lipid profile was only seen in those heavy co-twins who also had high liver fat. Conversely, BMI-discordant pairs concordant for liver fat did not differ significantly in lipid parameters. In multivariate analyses controlling for \u0394subcutaneous, \u0394intra-abdominal fat, sex, \u0394smoking and \u0394physical activity, \u0394liver fat was the only independent variable explaining the variation in \u0394ApoB, \u0394total cholesterol, and \u0394LDL-C concentration.\nSeveral pro-atherogenic changes in the amounts of lipids but not in the composition of lipoprotein particles were observed in acquired obesity. In particular, accumulation of liver fat was associated with lipid disturbances, independent of genetic effects.",

    "abstract": "A case of female parapagus conjoined twins living as unseparated is presented in this report. The twins had two heads, four arms and two legs. As a result of their fusion, operative care had been considered to be unacceptable, and the family had refused to take care of them. At three years of age, they were referred to the Rehabilitation Department with the complaint of inability to walk. While designing the rehabilitation program, somatosensory evoked potential evaluation was performed and showed that twin 1 controlled the right leg and twin 2 controlled the left. The program consisted of coordinated pacing training by verbal commands, upper and lower extremity reeducation, and balance and coordination exercises. After two months of inpatient rehabilitation, they were able to walk independently with a specially designed walker. Currently, the twins are 11 years old with normal academic achievement, and they are able to walk, run and climb the stairs independently.",

    "abstract": "A twin-based comparative study on the genetic influences in metabolic endophenotypes in two populations of substantial ethnic, environmental, and cultural differences was performed.\nData on 11 metabolic phenotypes including anthropometric measures, blood glucose, and lipids levels as well as blood pressure were available from 756 pairs of Danish twins (309 monozygotic and 447 dizygotic twin pairs) with a mean age of 38 years (range: 18-67) and from 325 pairs of Chinese twins (183 monozygotic and 142 dizygotic twin pairs) with a mean age of 40.5 years (range: 18-69). Twin modeling was performed on full and nested models with the best fitting models selected.\nHeritability estimates were compared between Danish and Chinese samples to identify differential genetic influences on each of the phenotypes. Except for hip circumference, all other body measures exhibited similar heritability patterns in the two samples with body weight showing only a slight difference. Higher genetic influences were estimated for fasting blood glucose level in Chinese twins, whereas the Danish twins showed more genetic regulation over most lipids phenotypes. Systolic blood pressure was more genetically controlled in Danish than in Chinese twins.\nMetabolic endophenotypes show disparity in their genetic determinants in populations under distinct environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to examine associations between each of three leisure activities (Cognitive, Physical, and Social) and performance in selected cognitive domains (Speed, Memory, Verbal ability, and Executive functions) and global cognition.

Their mean age was 71 years and 66% were women. We used a discordant co-twin design, with cognitive performance measures as dependent variables and leisure activities as independent variables. Multiple regression analyses were performed, adjusting for potentially relevant medical and health factors.\nDiscordance in Cognitive Activity and Social Activity participation was positively associated with discordance in performance on some cognitive domains. There were no associations between Physical Activity participation and cognition. Discordance in several cardiovascular, frailty, and sensory variables was associated with discordance in cognitive performance measures.\nThis study identified lifestyle and health-related influences on late-life cognition. Our findings not only help in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms, they also have practical implications for interventions to prevent or slow age-related cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Children born with non-optimal birth characteristics - that is, are small for gestational age and/or preterm - have an increased risk for several long-term effects such as neurological sequelae and chronic disease. The purpose of this study was to examine whether twins exhibited a different outcome, compared with singletons, in terms of hospitalization during adolescence and early adulthood, and to what extent differences remain when considering the divergence in birth characteristics between singletons and twins. Persons born between 1973 and 1983 in Sweden and surviving until age 13 were included and followed until the end of 2006. Data on birth characteristics, parental socio-demographic factors, and hospitalizations were collected from national registers. Adjusting for parental socio-demographic factors, twins had a higher risk of being hospitalized than singletons (odds ratio, OR = 1.17, 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.10-1.25) and more often due to 'Congenital anomalies' (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.06-1.28), 'Infections' (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.08-1.20), 'External causes of illness' (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.06-1.15), and 'Diseases of the nervous system' (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.10-1.26). Stratifying for birth characteristics, this difference diminishes, and for some diagnoses non-optimal twins seem to do slightly better than non-optimal singletons. Thus, twins with non-optimal birth characteristics had a lower risk of hospitalization than non-optimal singletons on, for example, 'Congenital anomalies' and 'Diseases of the nervous system' (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.77-0.96; OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.81-0.97, respectively) and Total (any) hospitalization (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.83-0.92). Among those with optimal birth characteristics, twins had an increased hospitalization due to 'External causes of illness' (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02-1.13) compared with optimal singletons. Twins have higher hospitalization rates than singletons. In stratifying for birth characteristics, this difference diminishes, and for some diagnoses, non-optimal twins seem to do less poorly than non-optimal singletons.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a human commensal bacterium found in the nasal cavity and other body sites. Identifying risk factors for S. aureus nasal carriage is of interest, as nasal carriage is a risk factor for subsequent invasive infection. We recently investigated the influence of host genetics on S. aureus carriage in Danish middle-aged and elderly twins, which indicated no significant heritability that could account for the observed S. aureus carriage. In the present study, we performed a questionnaire-based study of S. aureus colonization on the same cohort of 2,196 Danish middle-aged and elderly twins to identify specific risk factors for S. aureus nasal colonization, including analyzing the paired twins (n\u2009=\u2009478) that were discordant for S. aureus colonization. We found associations between risk factors and S. aureus nasal colonization among middle-aged and elderly twins, including age, male gender, psoriasis, and atopic diseases. Also, present living on a farm is clearly associated with S. aureus colonization, while smoking had a borderline statistically significant protective effect.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins (MZs) share an identical genomic sequence, which makes it impossible to discriminate one another with conventional genetic markers like STRs. On the other hand, phenotypic discordance between MZs implies the existence of different epigenetic characteristics. DNA methylation, an essential epigenetic modification, however, might be a potential biomarker to solve the forensic puzzle. In this study, we examined 22 pairs of MZs with a methylation BeadChip including 27,578 CpG sites. The results suggested that MZs exhibited remarkable differences of genome-wide 5-methylcytosine. According to a set of criteria of selection, 92 CpG sites with significant differences of methylation status within MZs were identified from the global epigenome. In conclusion, this pilot study suggested that CpG methylation profile could be a useful biomarker in individual identification of MZs.",

    "abstract": "Emotional processing difficulties are potential risk markers for eating disorders that are also present after recovery. The aim of this study was to examine these traits in twins with eating disorders.\nThe Reading the Mind in the Eyes test, Emotional Stroop task and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale were administered to 112 twins with and without eating disorders (DSM IV-TR eating disorder criteria). Generalised estimating equations compared twins with eating disorders against unaffected co-twins and control twins, and within-pair correlations were calculated for clinical monozygotic (n\u2009=\u200950) and dizygotic twins (n\u2009=\u200920).\nEmotion recognition difficulties, attentional biases to social threat and difficulties in emotion regulation were greater in twins with eating disorders, and some were present in their unaffected twin siblings. Evidence for a possible genetic basis was highest for emotion recognition and attentional biases to social stimuli.\nEmotion recognition difficulties and sensitivity to social threat appear to be endophenotypes associated with eating disorders.

    "abstract": "To investigate the association between a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and overactive bladder (OAB) in women of premenopausal age.\nPopulation-based study.\nThe Swedish Twin Register.\nIn 2005, a total of 14\u00a0094 female twins born between 1959 and 1985 in the Swedish Twin Registry participated in a comprehensive survey on common exposures and complex diseases. Structured questions provided information on GDM and OAB. The present study was designed as a cross-sectional analysis including all women in the cohort having given birth before 2005 (n\u00a0=\u00a07855).\nA logistic regression model based on generalised estimating equations was used to derive odds ratios (ORs).\nThe association between a history of GDM and OAB was estimated using ORs with 95%\u00a0confidence intervals (CIs).\nThe prevalence of OAB in women with a history of GDM was 19.1% compared with 10.7% in women without GDM. This corresponded to a two-fold increased odds of OAB in women with a history of gestational diabetes (OR\u00a02.13, 95% CI 1.48-3.05). After adjusting the analysis for age, body mass index, parity, smoking, and diabetes mellitus, having had GDM was associated with doubled odds of OAB (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.26-2.80).\nA history of GDM was positively associated with OAB among women of premenopausal age.

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to understand the biological pathways involved in twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) by performing global gene expression analysis of amniotic fluid (AF) cell-free RNA.\nA prospective whole transcriptome microarray study analyzing cell-free RNA in AF from TTTS recipient twins and singleton controls was carried out. Significantly differentially regulated genes in TTTS cases (N\u2009=\u20098) versus matched controls (N\u2009=\u20098) were identified and pathways analyses performed. Significant gene expression differences between stage II TTTS recipients (N\u2009=\u20095) and stage III TTTS recipients with abnormal Doppler measurements (N\u2009=\u20095) were also analyzed.\nAnalysis of paired data from TTTS cases and controls revealed differential expression of 801 genes, which were significantly enriched for neurological disease and cardiovascular system pathways. We also identified cardiovascular genes and pathways associated with the presence of critically abnormal Doppler measurements in stage III TTTS recipients.\nThis study provides the first transcriptome-wide data on the impact of TTTS on fetal development. Our results show that gene expression involving neurological and cardiovascular pathways are altered in recipient fetuses prior to surgical treatment. This has relevance for the origins of long-term complications seen in survivors and for the development of future fetal biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Occasionally \"identical twins\" are phenotypically different, raising the question of zygosity and the issue of genetic versus environmental influences during development. We recently noted monochorionic-monoamniotic twins, one of which had an isolated cardiac abnormality, noncompaction cardiomyopathy, a condition characterized by cardiac ventricular hypertrabeculation. We examined the prenatal course and subsequent pathologic correlation since ventricular morphogenesis may depend on early muscular contraction and blood flow. The monochorionic-monoamniotic female twin pair was initially identified since one fetus presented with increased nuchal translucency. Complete heart block was later identified in the fetus with nuchal translucency who did not survive after delivery. In contrast, the unaffected twin had normal cardiac studies both prenatally and postnatally. Pathologic analysis of the affected twin demonstrated noncompaction of the left ventricle with dysplasia of the aortic and pulmonary valves. Dissection of the cardiac conduction system disclosed atrioventricular bundle fibrosis. Maternal lupus studies, amniocentesis with karyotype, and studies for 22q11.2 were normal. To test for zygosity, we performed multiple STR marker analysis and found that all markers were shared even using nonblood tissues from the affected twin. These studies demonstrate that monozygotic twins that are monochorionic monoamniotic can be discordant for cardiac noncompaction. The results suggest further investigation into the potential roles of pathologic fibrosis, contractility, and blood flow in cardiac ventricle development.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential contribution of environmental factors and testosterone on male alopecia.\nNinety-two identical male twins were recruited from 2009 to 2011. A comprehensive questionnaire was completed followed by the acquisition of sputum samples for testosterone analysis and standardized digital photography. Frontal, temporal, and vertex hair loss was assessed from these photographs. Hair loss was then correlated with survey responses and testosterone levels between twin pairs. Two independent, blinded observers also rated the photographs for hair thinning.\nIncreased smoking duration (p < 0.001) and the presence of dandruff (p = 0.028) were significantly associated with increased frontal hair loss. Increased exercise duration (p = 0.002), consumption of more than four alcoholic drinks per week (p = 0.042), and increased money spent on hair loss products (p = 0.050) were all associated with increased temporal hair loss. Daily hat use (p = 0.050), higher body mass index (p = 0.012), and higher testosterone levels (p = 0.040) were associated with decreased temporal hair loss. Factors that were significantly associated with increased vertex hair loss included abstinence from alcohol consumption (p = 0.030), consumption of more than four alcoholic drinks per week (p = 0.004), increased smoking duration (p = 0.047), increased exercise duration (p = 0.050), and increased stress duration (p = 0.010). Lower body mass index, more children, increased caffeine consumption, history of skin disease, and abstinence from alcohol were significantly associated with increased hair thinning scores (p < 0.05).\nThis study offers substantial evidence that exogenous factors may have a clinically significant impact on hair loss.\nRisk, III.",

    "abstract": "Although nanoscale twinning is an effective means to enhance yield strength and tensile ductility in metals, nanotwinned metals generally fail well below their theoretical strength limit due to heterogeneous dislocation nucleation from boundaries or surface imperfections. Here we show that Au nanowires containing angstrom-scaled twins (0.7 nm in thickness) exhibit tensile strengths up to 3.12 GPa, near the ideal limit, with a remarkable ductile-to-brittle transition with decreasing twin size. This is opposite to the behaviour of metallic nanowires with lower-density twins reported thus far. Ultrahigh-density twins (twin thickness<2.8 nm) are shown to give rise to homogeneous dislocation nucleation and plastic shear localization, contrasting with the heterogeneous slip mechanism observed in single-crystalline or low-density-twinned nanowires. The twin size dependent dislocation nucleation and deformation represent a new type of size effect distinct from the sample size effects described previously.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) defines a group of common, complex neurodevelopmental disorders. Although the aetiology of ASD has a strong genetic component, there is considerable monozygotic (MZ) twin discordance indicating a role for non-genetic factors. Because MZ twins share an identical DNA sequence, disease-discordant MZ twin pairs provide an ideal model for examining the contribution of environmentally driven epigenetic factors in disease. We performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in a sample of 50 MZ twin pairs (100 individuals) sampled from a representative population cohort that included twins discordant and concordant for ASD, ASD-associated traits and no autistic phenotype. Within-twin and between-group analyses identified numerous differentially methylated regions associated with ASD. In addition, we report significant correlations between DNA methylation and quantitatively measured autistic trait scores across our sample cohort. This study represents the first systematic epigenomic analyses of MZ twins discordant for ASD and implicates a role for altered DNA methylation in autism.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral cavernous malformations are focal vascular abnormalities that show recurrent intralesional microhemorrhage and may cause focal deficits or seizures in affected patients. These lesions occur in both sporadic and inherited autosomal dominant form. Germline mutations in three different genes have been identified yet. One explanation for the unpredictable individual clinical course with wide variability of the number of developing cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) and their rate of progression within CCM families is thought to be based upon a \"two-hit\" mechanism. However, the direct influence of a heterozygous underlying germline mutation in combination with secondary somatic mutations on a patient's individual clinical course is hard to investigate in vivo. In this context, we present a rare and interesting case of monozygotic twins heterozygous for the CCM1 germline mutation c.730-1G>A and discuss their similar age and type of disease manifestation and their beginning divergent clinical course.",

    "abstract": "Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is a common surgical cause of vomiting, which requires surgery in infant. There is the complete or partial obstruction of pylorus due to hypertrophy of circular muscle of the pylorus leading gastric outlet obstruction. The occurrence of IHPS in dizygotic twins is rarer and the theory of genetic origin alone does not explain it. Recent literature points to the association of bottle feeding in singletons to be a major aetiological factor for this condition. Here, we present a rare case of dizygotic twins who were bottle-fed and were affected with IHPS. We review the literature and focus on the question of whether this condition in twins supports a genetic or environmental origin of IHPS.",

    "abstract": "We examined midlife dietary patterns in relation to (1) sociodemographic and health-related characteristics and (2) survival.\nA two-step cluster analysis of a 12-item food questionnaire was used to derive dietary patterns in a cohort of 16 649 members of the Swedish Twin Registry, a prospective, population-based study of twins. The average age at baseline (1967) was 55.5 years; the follow-up for all-cause mortality extended until 2011 (26.8\u00b112.35 years or 345,127 person-years) via death records.\nFour dietary patterns (classes) distinguishable by demographic and health characteristics emerged: Moderate Intake and Starch Diet (Class 1), Moderate Intake Diet with Low Flour-Based Foods (Class 2), Meat and Starch Diet (Class 3) and Low Meat Intake Diet (Class 4). Membership in Class 3 was associated with 7% increased risk of mortality compared with Class 2 independent of baseline age, cohort, sex and body mass index. These results were mostly explained by sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. When follow-up was restricted to those in the study for 20+ years, both Classes 1 and 3 conferred increased risk of mortality compared with Class 2, independent of covariates. Analyses conducted within twin pairs revealed similar results.\nMidlife diet over-represented by meat and starch-based foods may increase the risk of mortality, whereas the diet low in starch may be beneficial. These results appear to be independent of factors shared by twins, as well as at least partially a function of social and lifestyle factors, particularly marital status and smoking.",

    "abstract": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the major pediatric cancer. At diagnosis, the developmental timing of mutations contributing critically to clonal diversification and selection can be buried in the leukemia's covert natural history. Concordance of ALL in monozygotic, monochorionic twins is a consequence of intraplacental spread of an initiated preleukemic clone. Studying monozygotic twins with ALL provides a unique means of uncovering the timeline of mutations contributing to clonal evolution, pre- and postnatally. We sequenced the whole genomes of leukemic cells from two twin pairs with ALL to comprehensively characterize acquired somatic mutations in ALL, elucidating the developmental timing of all genetic lesions. Shared, prenatal, coding-region single-nucleotide variants were limited to the putative initiating lesions. All other nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants were distinct between tumors and, therefore, secondary and postnatal. These changes occurred in a background of noncoding mutational changes that were almost entirely discordant in twin pairs and likely passenger mutations acquired during leukemic cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of prenatal echocardiography in the diagnosis of intracardiac malformations and the degree of cardiac fusion in conjoined twins presenting to a single center over a 25-year period.\nThe study group included 53 sets of conjoined twins from 1987 to 2012, including 38 thoracopagus, six parapagus, six omphalo-ischiopagus, two omphalopagus, and one cephalopagus. Twins were classified according to the degree of cardiac fusion: separate hearts and pericardium (group A, n\u00a0= 10), separated hearts and common pericardium (group B, n\u00a0= 2), fused atria and separated ventricles (group C, n\u00a0= 2), and fused atria and ventricles (group D, n\u00a0= 39). Postmortem examination was possible in 68 individual cases (98 deaths [69.3%]).\nCardiac defects were diagnosed in 47 sets of twins (88.6%). In 10 (18.8%), only one fetus was affected, and in 37 (69.8%), both fetuses were affected (n\u00a0= 84/106 [79.2%]). There was a high predominance of right-sided lesions (63.0% [53 fetuses in 84 affected]) including pulmonary atresia or stenosis (35.7%), tricuspid atresia (11.9%), and hypoplastic or small right ventricle (21.4%). Autopsy findings added information to fetal echocardiographic findings in nine sets of twins (25.7%). Three pairs classified antenatally in groups A, B, and D were confirmed by autopsy in groups B, C, and C, respectively.\nThis study demonstrates that specialized fetal echocardiography is not a perfect diagnostic tool but is sensitive enough to establish prognosis in the counseling process. Because of complexity, such evaluations should be performed only at tertiary centers by specialists who are familiar with the peculiarities of this rare malformation. The predominance of right-sided lesions is not only an interesting finding, but this information has essential importance in terms of shortening examination times, allowing a more focused analysis of the fetal heart.",

    "abstract": "To study the regulatory mechanisms of selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) independent of confounding genetic factors, monochorionic (MC) twins are the ideal model, because they have identical genomic DNA. We hypothesize that the intrauterine growth restriction fetus has mitochondrial activation compared with its larger counterpart, and sought to demonstrate this using the MC twin model.\nFetal cord blood and amniotic fluid of MC twins were prospectively collected during delivery. Mitochondrial DNA of cord blood was measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and mitochondria in amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells (AFMSCs) were analyzed with MitoTracker staining.\nTertiary referring center.\nForty-three pairs of MC twins, including 24 pairs with sIUGR and 19 pairs without.\nNone.\nMitochondrial DNA contents were measured and presented as fold difference between the small and large fetuses. After staining with MitoTracker, mitochondrial intensity in AFMSCs was analyzed with the Image J program.\nThe fold differences of the cord blood mitochondrial DNA content between the small and large twins were significantly higher in the MC twins with sIGUR (2.5 \u00b1 1.2, n = 24 pairs) than in those without sIUGR (1.2 \u00b1 0.3, n = 19 pairs). In addition, mitochondrial staining intensities were significantly higher in the AFMSCs derived from growth-restricted fetuses than from control fetuses.\nMitochondrial activation in the sIUGR fetus of MC twins was likely regulated by locally adverse placental and blood flow conditions, instead of genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in SCN2A gene cause a variety of epilepsy syndromes. We report a novel SCN2A-associated epilepsy phenotype in monozygotic twins with tonic seizures soon after birth and a suppression-burst electroencephalography (EEG) pattern. We reviewed the medical records, EEG tracings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and neuropathologic findings, and performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) on Twin B's DNA and Sanger sequencing (SS) on candidate gene mutations. Extensive neurometabolic evaluation and early neuroimaging studies were normal. Twin A died of an iatrogenic cause at 2 weeks of life. His neuropathologic examination was remarkable for dentate-olivary dysplasia and granule cell dispersion of the dentate gyrus. Twin B became seizure free at 8 months and was off antiepileptic drugs by 2 years. His brain MRI, normal at 2 months, revealed evolving brainstem and basal ganglia abnormalities at 8 and 15 months that resolved by 20 months. At 2.5 years, Twin B demonstrated significant developmental delay. Twin B's WGS revealed a heterozygous variant c.788C>T predicted to cause p.Ala263Val change in SCN2A and confirmed to be de novo in both twins by SS. In conclusion, we have identified a de novo SCN2A mutation as the etiology for Ohtahara syndrome in monozygotic twins associated with a unique dentate-olivary dysplasia in the deceased twin.",

We present the case of two 7 year-old monozygotic twins that presented with congenital insensitivity to pain and compulsive onychophagia without directed parental counseling or behavioral modification strategies. The presenting child was noted to have an acute digital felon and osteomyelitis of several distal phalanges, and the sister had a similar history with distal phalangeal amputations. The occurrence of these overlapping disorders in monozygotic twins has not been previously reported, however, patient and parental education with behavioral modifications of injurious and compulsive behavior is the cornerstone of management.

    "abstract": "In the present study, we evaluated whether childhood differences in body height between singletons and twins persist into adulthood. Data from the Medical Birth Register of Norway were linked with data from the Norwegian National Conscript Service. This study used data on the 457,999 males who were born alive and without physical anomalies in single or twin births in Norway during 1967-1984 and who were examined at the mandatory military conscription (age 18-20 years; 1985-2003). For sibling comparisons, the authors selected the 1,721 sibships of full brothers that included at least 1 male born in a single birth and at least 1 male born in a twin birth (4,520 persons, including 2,493 twins and 2,027 singletons). An analysis of the total study population using generalized estimating equations showed that the twins were 0.6 cm (95% confidence interval: 0.4, 0.7) shorter than were the singletons after adjustment for a series of background factors. The fixed-effects regression analysis of the sibships that included both twins and singletons showed that the twins were 0.9 cm (95% confidence interval: 0.6, 1.2) shorter than were their singleton brothers. The study suggests that male twins born in Norway during 1967-1984 were slightly shorter in early adulthood than were singletons.",

    "abstract": "The contention that Religion/Spirituality (R/S) influences the development of alcohol dependence (AD) is increasingly supported, but risk factors have not been adequately examined together with protective R/S factors so as to determine the nature and relative strength of these domains at different stages in the development of alcoholism. Secondary data analysis of a sample of 4,002 young adult female twins used conditional Cox proportional hazards survival models to examine three distinct stages in the development of alcoholism: years to initiation of drinking, years from first drink to at-risk drinking, and years from at-risk drinking to AD. Risk and protective factors from models of alcoholism etiology and studies of R/S dimensionality were modeled simultaneously as predictors of each discrete stage and compared. Findings demonstrated that both risk factors and R/S variables influenced initiation of alcohol use; only R/S variables influenced subsequent progression to at-risk drinking; and risk factors primarily influenced further progression to AD. Protective factors (R/S variables being an exemplar) appeared to be critical determinants of intermediate-stage progression, thus suggesting that R/S factors and other psychosocial interventions might be particularly effective in delaying progression toward AD at this stage. In contrast, after the onset of at-risk drinking, the influence of (genetically based) risk factors appeared to accelerate AD regardless of most other influences. Thus, the timing of psychosocial interventions appears critical to their potency and impact.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging studies have indicated abnormalities in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits in obsessive-compulsive disorder patients, but results have not been consistent. Since there are significant sex differences in human brain anatomy and obsessive-compulsive symptomatology and its developmental trajectories tend to be distinct in males and females, we investigated whether sex is a potential source of heterogeneity in neuroimaging studies on obsessive-compulsive symptoms. We selected male and female twin pairs who were concordant for scoring either high or low for obsessive-compulsive symptoms and a group of discordant pairs where one twin scored high and the co-twin scored low. The design included 24 opposite-sex twin pairs. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of 31 males scoring high for obsessive-compulsive symptoms, 41 low-scoring males, 58 high-scoring females, and 73 low-scoring females were analyzed and the interaction of obsessive-compulsive symptoms by sex on gray matter volume was assessed using voxel-based morphometry. An obsessive-compulsive symptom by sex interaction was observed for the left middle temporal gyrus, the right middle temporal gyrus, and the right precuneus. These interactions acted to reduce or hide a main effect in our study and illustrate the importance of taking sex into account when investigating the neurobiology of obsessive-compulsive symptoms.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces a co-twin control method commonly used in the medical literature but not often within educational research. This method allows for a comparison of twins discordant for an \"exposure,\" approximating alternative outcomes in the counterfactual model. Example analyses use data drawn from the Florida Twin Project on Reading to determine whether exposure to \"teacher quality,\" measured by growth in oral reading fluency (ORF) scores of classmates, causally affects ORF performance of twins in the subsequent years. The analysis highlights PROC MIXED in SAS, including a novel expansion to allow for the nested data. Results from 2,788 twins suggested that being in classrooms with lower teacher quality in first grade leads to lower ORF scores in second and third grade with little indication of possible genetic or environmental confounding.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to determine the accuracy of sonographic formulas for estimating birth weight in twin pregnancies.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive twin pregnancies undergoing sonography at within 1 week of delivery. Pregnancies were included if biometric measurements and birth weight were available and excluded if anomalies were present. Estimated fetal weight was calculated using three sonographic formulas: two derived from singletons (Hadlock and Shepard) and one from twins (Ong). The correlation between estimated fetal weight and birth weight was determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The accuracy of each formula (bias) was assessed using the mean percentage error [(estimated fetal weight - birth weight)/birth weight \u00d7 100], and the precision (random error) was estimated from the standard deviation of the percentage error. The screening efficiency of each formula for intrauterine growth restriction, defined as below the 10th percentile on the Alexander growth standard, was assessed. The effect of twin presentation was determined using a paired analysis.\nOf 1744 consecutive twin pregnancies, 270 (540 infants) met inclusion criteria. The estimated fetal weight of all 3 formulas strongly correlated with the birth weight (Pearson r = 0.90 for Hadlock, 0.87 for Shepard, and 0.92 for Ong). Each formula had similar sensitivity (65%-70%) and specificity (85%-90%) for intrauterine growth restriction. For each formula, the correlation coefficient was similar between twins A and B (Pearson r = 0.85-0.93); however, the estimated fetal weight for twin A tended to underestimate birth weight, whereas the estimated fetal weight for twin B tended to overestimate birth weight.\nThree widely used estimated fetal weight formulas, two derived from singletons and one from twins, perform equally well in estimating birth weight in twin gestations.",

The estimated fetal weight of all 3 formulas strongly correlated with the birth weight (Pearson r = 0.90 for Hadlock, 0.87 for Shepard, and 0.92 for Ong). Each formula had similar sensitivity (65%-70%) and specificity (85%-90%) for intrauterine growth restriction. For each formula, the correlation coefficient was similar between twins A and B (Pearson r = 0.85-0.93); however, the estimated fetal weight for twin A tended to underestimate birth weight, whereas the estimated fetal weight for twin B tended to overestimate birth weight.",

    "abstract": "The Gilbert syndrome-associated functional TATA box variant UGT1A1*28 (A(TA)7TAA) was found to increase susceptibility to pigment gallstone formation in patients with haemolytic anaemia. Further studies in extensive cohorts demonstrated an increased risk of this variant for cholesterol gallstone disease (GD). We now investigated this polymorphism as a determinant of symptomatic GD in Swedish twins.\nThe Swedish Twin Registry was merged with the Hospital Discharge and Causes of Death Registries and searched for GD-related diagnoses among monozygotic (MZ) twins living in the Stockholm area. In addition, we screened the TwinGene database for GD. In total, we found 44 MZ twin pairs with and eight MZ twins without GD to be evaluable. GD-free twins from TwinGene (109 concordantly MZ and 126 independent DZ) served as controls. UGT1A1*28 genotyping was performed using TaqMan assays.\nOverall, 58 and 8 of 106 twins with GD were hetero- and homozygous UGT1A1 risk allele carriers respectively. The case-control association tests showed a significantly (P < 0.05) increased risk of developing GD (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.00-2.63) in heterozygotes carriers and in addition, a trend (P = 0.075) for an increased risk among carriers (OR = 1.52, 95% CI 0.97-2.44) of the risk allele.\nThese data from Swedish twins confirm the Gilbert variant as risk factor for GD. Our observation is in line with nucleation in bilirubin supersaturated bile representing an initial step in cholelithogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac dysfunction is common in the recipient fetus of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). In this study, we aimed to document the severity of fetal cardiac dysfunction in Stage IV TTTS (fetal hydrops) and assess evolution of cardiac function longitudinally after fetoscopic laser surgery.\nWe reviewed obstetric ultrasound examination data, pre- and postoperative echocardiograms and neonatal outcomes for 22 cases of Stage IV TTTS undergoing fetoscopic laser ablation of placental anastomoses between 1998 and 2011. Myocardial performance index, atrioventricular valve flow patterns, ventricular shortening fraction, ventricular hypertrophy, outflow tract obstruction and venous Doppler waveforms were assessed.\nNineteen fetuses (86.4%) had ascites, eight (36.4%) had pleural effusions, nine (40.9%) had a pericardial effusion and 12 (54.5%) had subcutaneous edema at presentation. Preoperatively, cardiac function was grossly abnormal in all. Eight fetuses (36.4%) had functional pulmonary atresia and one (4.5%) had functional aortic atresia. Seventy-seven percent of recipient fetuses survived until birth. Postoperative echocardiographic follow-up (mean, 26 days) showed that indices of fetal cardiac function improved considerably, but never completely normalized. Six of the eight fetuses with functional pulmonary atresia (75.0%), as well as the fetus with functional aortic atresia, survived to birth. In all cases, the functional atresia resolved within 48 h of laser ablation therapy and none had structural valve anomalies at birth. All fetal effusions resolved after the laser.\nFetoscopic laser ablation of placental anastomoses reverses cardiac dysfunction and valvulopathy, even in the most severe cases of TTTS. However, recovery takes longer than in early stage disease.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have shown a relationship between birth weight discordance and adverse perinatal outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the perinatal risk factors and neonatal complications of discordant twins who are admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.\nA total of 87 sets of twins were enrolled in this retrospective study, of which 22 sets were discordant twins and 65 sets were concordant twins. Binary Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors associated with the occurrence of discordant twins. The common neonatal complications of discordant twins were also investigated.\nMultivariate analysis showed that the use of assisted reproductive techniques, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and unequal placental sharing were risk factors for the occurrence of discordant twins. The incidence of small for gestational age infants and very low birth weight infants of discordant twins was significantly higher, while the birth weight of discordant twins was significantly lower than those of concordant twins. The duration of hospitalization of discordant twins was longer than that of concordant twins. The incidence of several neonatal complications, such as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and intracranial hemorrhage, was higher in discordant twins than that in concordant twins. The percentage of those requiring pulmonary surfactant and mechanical ventilation was significantly higher in discordant twins than that in concordant twins.\nUse of assisted reproductive techniques, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and unequal placental sharing are perinatal risk factors of discordant twins who are admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. These infants are also much more likely to suffer from various neonatal complications, especially respiratory and central nervous system diseases. It is important to prevent the occurrence of discordant twins by decreasing these risk factors and timely treatment should be given to discordant twins.",

    "abstract": "This study was undertaken to identify genetic polymorphisms that are associated with the risk of an elevated fasting glucose (FG) level using genome-wide analyses. We explored a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for FG level in a genome-wide study from a Korean twin-family cohort (the Healthy Twin Study) using a combined linkage and family-based association analysis approach. We investigated 1,754 individuals, which included 432 families and 219 pairs of monozygotic twins. Regions of chromosomes 2q23.3-2q31.1, 15q26.1-15q26.3, 16p12.1, and 20p13-20p12.2, were found to show evidence of linkage with FG level, and several markers in these regions were found to be significantly associated with FG level using family-based or general association tests. In particular, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs6138953) on the PTPRA gene in the 20p13 region (combined P = 1.8 \u00d7 10(-6)) was found to be associated with FG level, and the PRKCB1 gene (in 16p12.1) to be possibly associated with FG level. In conclusion, multiple regions of chromosomes 2q23.3-2q31.1, 15q26.1-15q26.3, 16p12.1, and 20p13-20p12.2 are associated with FG level in our Korean twin-family cohort. The combined approach of genome-wide linkage and family-based association analysis is useful to identify novel or known genetic regions concerning FG level in a family cohort study.",

    "abstract": "Twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS) may occur in monochorionic twins either spontaneously or after laser surgery for twin-twin transfusion syndrome. Our aim was to analyze the placental angioarchitecture in spontaneous versus post-laser TAPS.\nWe included all monochorionic twin placentas with spontaneous or post-laser TAPS injected at our center between 2002 and 2012. Placental angioarchitecture was evaluated using colored dye injection.\nA total of 600 monochorionic placentas were injected during the study period of which 43 (7.2%) with TAPS (spontaneous TAPS, n\u00a0=\u00a016; post-laser TAPS, n\u00a0=\u00a027). Almost all anastomoses (96%; 119/124) were very small (diameter <1\u00a0mm) and the majority was localized near the placental margin. The median number of anastomoses per placenta was 4 (interquartile range (IQR): 3-5) in the spontaneous TAPS group and 2 (IQR: 1-3) in the post-laser TAPS group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Arterio-arterial (AA) anastomoses were detected in 14.0% (6/43) of TAPS placentas and were all minuscule (diameter <1\u00a0mm). The rate of\u00a0AA anastomoses in the spontaneous TAPS group and post-laser TAPS group was 18.8% (3/16) and 11.1% (3/27), respectively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.184).\nSpontaneous TAPS placentas have a significantly higher total number of anastomoses compared to post-laser TAPS placentas. Most anastomoses were localized near the margins of the placenta. Minuscule AA anastomoses were detected sporadically in both groups and the rate of AA anastomoses is slightly higher in the spontaneous TAPS group than in the post-laser group.\nSpontaneous TAPS placentas have a different placental angioarchitecture than post-laser TAPS placentas in terms of number and type of vascular anastomoses.",

    "abstract": "To examine gait patterns and gait quality, 7 twins with cerebral palsy were measured preoperatively and after surgical intervention. The aim was to study differences and/or similarities in gait between twins, the influence of personal characteristics and birth conditions, and to describe the development of gait over time after single event multilevel surgery. A standardized clinical exam and a three-dimensional gait analysis were performed. Gait patterns were classified according to Sutherland and Davids, and the Gillette Gait Index was calculated as a global measure of the gait impairment. Next to subject characteristics at time of first measurement, and at time of birth, birth conditions were collected. Gait patterns were determined as crouch gait in 13 legs, as stiff gait in 6 legs and as jump gait in 8 legs. One leg showed a normal gait pattern. The knee flexion-extension angle correlated most constant with the knee flexion-extension angle of the contralateral leg (range 0.91-0.99). Correlations with the legs of the sibling showed variable correlations (range 0.44-0.99); with all other legs medium to high correlations of 0.73-0.91 were found. The Gillette Gait Index was found to initially decrease after surgical intervention. Similar correlations were found between twins or between legs for the gait pattern expressed by the knee flexion-extension angle, and the Gillette Gait Index improved after surgery. It seems that gait quality in twins with cerebral palsy is characterized predominantly by the traumatic disorder: genetic dispositions and personal characteristics only play a negligible role.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to investigate whether vector velocity imaging (VVI), a non-Doppler speckle tracking ultrasound technology, is feasible in twin pregnancies and can aid management of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS).\nTwenty-seven women pregnant with monochorionic diamniotic twins affected by TTTS and 28 monochorionic pregnancies that did not develop TTTS were included in a prospective case-control study at a fetal medicine center. Fetal echocardiograms were recorded with dummy electrocardiography to retain original frame rates when exported for offline speckle tracking analysis using Syngo-VVI software (Siemens Corp, Munich, Germany). Right and left ventricular (LV) free wall Lagrangian strain was measured from the original coordinates. Within-twin pair ventricular strain differences including relationship to Quintero staging and response to laser therapy for TTTS were analyzed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\nThe VVI strain measurements could be analyzed in 182 of 200 TTTS and 96 of 112 non-TTTS control ventricles. Within-pair strain was concordant in non-TTTS controls. Recipient LV strain was reduced at all Quintero stages compared with donors (P < .01). Recipient right ventricular strain was reduced only in stages 3 and 4 (P\u00a0< .01). Strain improved at a median of 2 weeks following successful laser therapy. Intertwin differences in strain were independent of weight discordance.\nRecipient LV strain is reduced in stages 1 and 2 TTTS. Within-pair strain discordance may distinguish early TTTS from growth\u00a0discordance and guide timing of and management following treatment.",

    "abstract": "We report identical twins with intellectual disability, progressive spastic paraplegia and short stature, born to a consanguineous family. Intriguingly, both children presented with lymphadenitis caused by the live Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine. Two syndromes - hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and mycobacterial disease - thus occurred simultaneously. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation (p.R1105X) of the AP4E1 gene, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The p.R1105X mutation has no effect on AP4E1 mRNA levels, but results in lower levels of AP-4\u03b5 protein and of the other components of the AP-4 complex, as shown by western blotting, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. Thus, the C-terminal part of the AP-4\u03b5 subunit plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the AP-4 complex. No abnormalities of the IL-12/IFN-\u03b3 axis or oxidative burst pathways were identified. In conclusion, we identified twins with autosomal recessive AP-4 deficiency associated with HSP and mycobacterial disease, suggesting that AP-4 may play important role in the neurological and immunological systems.",

    "abstract": "Blood pressure variability (BPV) and its reduction in response to antihypertensive treatment are predictors of clinical outcomes; however, little is known about its heritability. In this study, we examined the relative influence of genetic and environmental sources of variance of BPV and the extent to which it may depend on race or sex in young twins.\nTwins were enrolled from two studies. One study included 703 white twins (308 pairs and 87 singletons) aged 18-34 years, whereas another study included 242 white twins (108 pairs and 26 singletons) and 188 black twins (79 pairs and 30 singletons) aged 12-30 years. BPV was calculated from 24-h ambulatory blood pressure recording.\nTwin modeling showed similar results in the separate analysis in both twin studies and in the meta-analysis. Familial aggregation was identified for SBP variability (SBPV) and DBP variability (DBPV) with genetic factors and common environmental factors together accounting for 18-40% and 23-31% of the total variance of SBPV and DBPV, respectively. Unique environmental factors were the largest contributor explaining up to 82-77% of the total variance of SBPV and DBPV. No sex or race difference in BPV variance components was observed. The results remained the same after adjustment for 24-h blood pressure levels.\nThe variance in BPV is predominantly determined by unique environment in youth and young adults, although familial aggregation due to additive genetic and/or common environment influences was also identified explaining about 25% of the variance in BPV.",

    "abstract": "One of the most consistent findings in psychology shows that people prefer and make positive attributions about attractive compared with unattractive people. The goal of the current study was to determine the power of attractiveness effects by testing whether these social judgments are made where attractiveness differences are smallest: between twins. Differences in facial attractiveness predicted twins' evaluations of self and their co-twin (n = 158; 54 male). In twin pairs, the more attractive twin judged their less attractive sibling as less physically attractive, athletic, socially competent, and emotionally stable. The less attractive twin did the reverse. Given that even negligible differences in facial attractiveness predicted self and co-twin attitudes, these results provide the strongest test yet of appearance-based stereotypes.",

We report on two monozygotic twin boys with a mosaic 1.5 Mb deletion in 15q13.3, including CHRNA7. The growth parameters were in the normal range for both twins. Both had language delay with hyperactivity, temper tantrums and poor social interaction but attended regular school. The percentage of abnormal cells was 40% on lymphocytes, and 25 and 35% on buccal smear in the first and second twins, respectively. The mosaicism for the 15q13.3 deletion can explain the milder phenotype observed in these two boys.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to assess the onset and the frequencies of the first intertwin contacts by four-dimensional ultrasound (4D US) in the 1st trimester of pregnancy. In the second part of the study, fetal behavior and Kurjak Antenatal Neurodevelopmental Test (KANET) score of twins compared to singletons in the 2nd and the 3rd trimesters was assessed.\nTransvaginal 4D assessment was performed in 20 women in the 1st trimester between 56 and 69 postmenstrual days (PMD), while trans-abdominal approach was performed from 70 PMD onwards and at weekly intervals until 112 PMD. Fetal behavior was assessed by 4D UD US between 28 and 36 gestational weeks in 49 twin pregnancies.\nThe first intertwin contacts appeared at 61 PMD, while complex body movements appeared at 68 PMD. The complexity of intertwin contacts increased from 84 PMD. With increasing gestational age, a higher frequency of movements was observed. The number of abnormal, borderline, and normal KANET scores between singletons and twins was not statistically significant. Scores for isolated eye blinking, mouthing, grimacing, hand to head movement, finger movements, Gestalt perception and general movements differed significantly in twins and singletons.\nTwo types of activities were observed: spontaneous and reactive. Although twins showed less activity and different behavioral pattern than singletons, a considerable proportion of overall motility was due to intertwin contacts.",

    "abstract": "Adolescent/young adult Hodgkin lymphoma (AYAHL) survivors report fewer exposures to infections during childhood compared with controls, and they have functional lymphocyte aberrations. The gut microbiota plays a central role in immunity.\nWe investigated whether fecal microbial diversity differed between 13 AYAHL survivors and their unaffected co-twin controls. Pyrosequencing of fecal bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons yielded 252\u2009943 edited reads that were assigned to species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and standardised for sequencing depth by random sampling. Microbial diversity was compared within vs between twin pairs and by case-control status.\nThe number of unique OTUs was more similar within twin pairs compared with randomly paired participants (P=0.0004). The AYAHL cases had fewer unique OTUs compared with their co-twin controls (338 vs 369, P=0.015); this difference was not significant (169 vs 183, P=0.10) when restricted to abundant OTUs.\nIn this small study, AYAHL survivors appear to have a deficit of rare gut microbes. Further work is needed to determine if reduced microbial diversity is a consequence of the disease, its treatment, or a particularly hygienic environment.",

    "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked to increased morbidity. An inflexibility of the autonomic nervous system might be the underlying mechanism. We aimed to assess whether PTSD and combat trauma exposure are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function and a predictor of death.\nWe measured HRV by power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram in 459 middle-aged veteran male twins. Combat trauma was assessed with the combat exposure scale, and current and remitted PTSD was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders. Mixed-effects regression models were used to test associations of PTSD and HRV between and within twin pairs.\nOf all twins, 211 had combat exposure, 31 had current PTSD, and 43 had remitted PTSD. Current PTSD was inversely associated with very-low-frequency and low-frequency HRV both in individual twins and within 20 pairs discordant for current PTSD. Twins with current PTSD had a 49% lower low-frequency HRV than their brothers without PTSD (p<.001). Remitted PTSD was not associated with HRV. Results were robust to adjustment for depression and other risk factors. Combat exposure was inversely associated with most HRV frequencies, but this association mostly diminished after adjustment for current PTSD.\nIn middle-aged veteran men, combat exposure and current PTSD are associated with measures of autonomic inflexibility previously shown to have prognostic significance. The negative health impact of combat exposure on autonomic function is mediated largely through PTSD and might reverse with remission of PTSD.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore if natural dizygotic (DZ) twinning is associated with earlier menopause and lower anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) values. We investigated if advanced biological reproductive aging, which can be responsible for the multiple follicle growth in familial twinning, is similar to mechanisms that occur in normal ovarian aging, reflected by earlier menopause in mothers of DZ twins and lower levels of AMH. A total of 16 mothers of DZ twins enrolled with the Netherlands Twin Register (average age at first assessment: 35.9 \u00b1 3.0 years) and 14 control mothers (35.1 \u00b1 3 years) took part in a prospective study. Fifteen years after entry into the study, which included follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) assessment, AMH was measured in stored serum samples and menopause status was evaluated. Average AMH levels were not significantly different between DZ twin mothers and controls (2.1 \u00b1 2.4 \u03bcg/L vs. 1.9 \u00b1 1.9 \u03bcg/L). Among the 16 mothers of twins, 7 had an elevated (FSH) value over 10 U/L at first assessment. Their AMH levels were lower than the nine twin mothers with normal FSH values: 0.6 \u00b1 0.4 versus 3.4 \u00b1 2.6 \u03bcg/L (p = .01). Of the mothers of twins, eight mothers had entered menopause at the second assessment compared with only one control mother (p = .07). Thus, slightly more DZ mothers were in menopause than the control mothers, although this difference was not significant. The subgroup of DZ twin mothers who had an increased FSH concentration 15 years ago had a limited ovarian reserve as reflected by lower AMH levels. These data indicate that advanced ovarian aging can be a feature in familial DZ twinning, particularly with elevated early follicular phase FSH.",

    "abstract": "This study considered how far nonverbal cognitive, language and reading abilities are affected by common genetic influences in a sample of 312 typically developing Chinese twin pairs aged from 3 to 11 years. Children were individually given tasks of Chinese word reading, receptive vocabulary, phonological memory, tone awareness, syllable and rhyme awareness, rapid automatized naming, morphological awareness and orthographic skills, and Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices. Factor analyses on the verbal tasks adjusted for age indicated two factors: Language as the first factor and Reading as the second factor. Univariate genetic analyses indicated that genetic influences were substantial for nonverbal cognitive ability and moderate for language and reading. Multivariate genetic analyses showed that nonverbal cognitive ability, language and reading were influenced by shared genetic origins, although there were specific genetic influences on verbal skills that were distinct from those on nonverbal cognitive ability. This study extends the Generalist Genes Hypothesis to Chinese language and reading skills, suggesting that the general effects of genes could be universal across languages.",

    "abstract": "Information on the correlation of normative reproductive hormone levels with physical development (Tanner stages) during puberty and on the influences of genes and environment on variation in these hormones and Tanner stages is limited.\nOne hundred twelve healthy 9-year-old twin pairs (n = 224) took part in a longitudinal study, of which 89 pairs participated again at age 12 years (n = 178).\nMorning urinary LH, FSH, estradiol, and salivary testosterone levels, determined by competitive immunoassays, were measured. Tanner stages were determined through physical examination.\nOver the 3-year interval, all hormone levels showed a 2- to 9-fold increase. LH and FSH at age 9 years predicted sex-specific Tanner stages at age 12 years in both boys and girls. Most of the associations between hormone levels at age 9 years and physical development at 12 years were explained by genetic influences. FSH in 9-year-old boys correlated with all hormone levels and Tanner stages at age 12 years. Moderate to high heritability estimates were found for hormone levels at both ages and in both sexes. In girls a shift from environmental (age 9 years) to genetic influences (age 12 years) was found for estradiol and pubic hair development, and for breast development a shift in the opposite direction was seen.\nDuring development LH and FSH (and testosterone in boys) levels predict secondary sexual characteristics in boys and girls 3 years later. These correlations are largely due to genes that are involved in both early pubertal hormone levels and subsequent physical development.",

    "abstract": "Epimerase deficiency galactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from partial impairment of UDP-galactose 4'-epimerase (GALE), the third enzyme in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism. Clinical severity of epimerase deficiency ranges from potentially lethal to apparently benign, likely reflecting the extent of GALE enzyme impairment, among other factors. We report here a case study of monozygotic twins identified by newborn screening with elevated total galactose and normal galactose-1P uridylyltransferase (GALT). Follow-up testing revealed partial impairment of GALE in hemolysates but near-normal activity in lymphoblasts; molecular testing identified a missense substitution, R220W, apparently in the homozygous state. The twins were treated with dietary galactose restriction for the first 18 months of life. During this time, independent testing revealed concurrent diagnoses of Williams Syndrome in both twins, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in one. Expression studies of R220W-hGALE in a null-background strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated a very limited impairment of V (max) for UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) and K (m) for UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc), but a galactose challenge in vivo failed to uncover any evidence of impaired Leloir function. Similarly, both twins demonstrated normal hemolysate galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1P) levels following normalization of their diets at 18 months of age. While these studies cannot rule out a negative consequence from some cryptic GALE impairment in a specific tissue or developmental stage, they suggest that the substitution, R220W, is mild to neutral, so that any GALE impairment in these twins is likely to be peripheral and therefore unlikely to be the cause of the negative outcomes observed.",

    "abstract": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most ubiquitous member of the herpes virus family and is the leading cause of congenital (vertical) infection in newborns (Fowler, Stagno, & Pass, 2003; Llorente, Steigmeyer, Cooper, Rivers, & Gazley, 2011; Noyola et al., 2000; Steigmeyer & Llorente, 2010). CMV is related to the group of viruses capable of causing more pernicious infectious diseases, such as chicken pox (Santos de Barona, 1998). Although the virus generally remains dormant, individuals whose symptoms are clinically apparent often are dramatically affected. Common symptomatic characteristics of the virus include microcephaly, jaundice, liver-spleen infections, pneumonia, cardiac anomalies, chorioretinitis, vision loss, sensory-neural hearing loss, mental retardation, and mononucleosis (Demmler, 1991; Kashden, Frison, Fowler, Pass, & Boll, 1998; Noyola et al., 2000; Pass, 2005; Santos de Barona). The prognosis of individuals with CMV is highly variable, and the prognosis of individuals with congenital CMV can usually be determined based on the extent of infection at birth. The purpose of this investigation is to present longitudinal results of neuropsychological evaluation of two dizygotic twin sets (one twin of each set is asymptomatic CMV-positive and the other is uninfected) who were reared in the same environment. In addition, the present findings are discussed within the context of emerging murine and other animal analogues of CMV as well as within the extant CMV literature.",

Twins with DS are rare. We report on monozygotic (MZ), monochorionic twin sisters with DS, whose parents are young (24 and 26 years old, respectively) and healthy. Family history is non contributory; pregnancy and delivery were uneventful. Both girls presented at birth with clinical manifestations of Down syndrome, that was confirmed cytogenetically (47XX,+21). Microsatellites analysis indicated that the twins are identical and that the extra chromosome 21 was of paternal origin.\nFor practical purposes, the causative non disjunction should be considered a single sporadic event, with an empirical recurrence risk estimated at about 1%.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a severe mental illness characterized by recurrent manic and depressive episodes. In bipolar disorder, family and twin studies suggest contributions from genetic and environmental factors; however, the detailed molecular pathogenesis is yet unknown. Thus, identification of biomarkers may contribute to the clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Monozygotic twins discordant for bipolar disorder are relatively rare but have been reported. Here we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of whole cell lysate derived from lymphoblastoid cells of monozygotic twins discordant for bipolar disorder by using two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). We found approximately 200 protein spots to be significantly differentially expressed between the patient and the co-twin (t test, p<0.05). Some of the proteins were subsequently identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and included proteins involved in cell death and glycolysis. To examine whether these proteins could serve as biomarkers of bipolar disorder, we performed Western blot analysis using case-control samples. Expression of phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), which is involved in glycolysis, was significantly up-regulated in patients with bipolar disorder (t test, p<0.05). Although PGAM1 cannot be regarded as a qualified biomarker of bipolar disorder from this preliminary finding, it could be one of the candidates for further study to identify biomarkers of bipolar disorder.",

    "abstract": "Evidence for the role of first-trimester ultrasound in predicting outcome in twin pregnancies is conflicting. The aim of this study was to determine the association between crown-rump length (CRL) discordance and adverse perinatal outcome in twin pregnancies.\nThis was a retrospective study of all twin pregnancies of known chorionicity from a large regional cohort over a 10-year period. Terminations of pregnancy, cases with fetal or chromosomal abnormalities and monoamniotic pregnancies were excluded. Receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between CRL discordance and stillbirth, neonatal mortality, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth (PTB) at\u2009<\u200934\u2009weeks' gestation and birth weight (BW) and ultrasound estimated fetal weight (EFW) discordance of \u2265\u200925%.\nA total of 2155 twin pregnancies were analyzed, of which 420 were monochorionic (MC) and 1735 dichorionic (DC). There were 42 fetal losses before 24\u2009weeks' gestation and 23 perinatal deaths. CRL discordance was poorly predictive for fetal loss at\u2009<\u200924\u2009weeks (area under the ROC curve (AUC), 0.54 (95% CI, 0.46-0.62)), perinatal loss (AUC, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.41-0.64)), BW discordance (AUC, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.56-0.65)), BW\u2009<\u20095(th) centile (AUC, 0.56 (95% CI, 0.53-0.59)), EFW discordance (AUC, 0.55 (95% CI, 0.51-0.60)) and PTB at\u2009<\u200934\u2009weeks (AUC, 0.50 (95% CI, 0.47-0.54)). Overall mortality was significantly higher in MC (5.0%) than in DC (2.6%) twins (P\u2009=\u20090.016). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that chorionicity (odds ratio 2.09 (95% CI, 1.06-4.10); P\u2009=\u20090.033) independently contributed to determining mortality, while CRL discordance (P\u2009=\u20090.201) did not. Adjusting for chorionicity did not improve the detection of adverse outcomes using CRL discordance.\nIn the absence of aneuploidy or structural fetal abnormality, CRL discordance is of poor predictive value for adverse perinatal outcome in both MC and DC twin pregnancies. CRL discordance should not be used routinely to identify twin pregnancies at high risk of adverse perinatal outcome.",

    "abstract": "Teenage childbirth is a risk factor for poor offspring outcomes, particularly offspring antisocial behavior. It is not clear, however, if maternal age at first birth (MAFB) is causally associated with offspring antisocial behavior or if this association is due to selection factors that influence both the likelihood that a young woman gives birth early and that her offspring engage in antisocial behavior. The current study addresses the limitations of previous research by using longitudinal data from Swedish national registries and children of siblings and children of twins comparisons to identify the extent to which the association between MAFB and offspring criminal convictions is consistent with a causal influence and confounded by genetic or environmental factors that make cousins similar. We found offspring born to mothers who began childbearing earlier were more likely to be convicted of a crime than offspring born to mothers who delayed childbearing. The results from comparisons of differentially exposed cousins, especially born to discordant monozygotic twin sisters, provide support for a causal association between MAFB and offspring criminal convictions. The analyses also found little evidence for genetic confounding due to passive gene-environment correlation. Future studies are needed to replicate these findings and to identify environmental risk factors that mediate this causal association.",

    "abstract": "The Craniofacial Biology Research Group in the School of Dentistry at The University of Adelaide is entering an exciting new phase of its studies of dental development and oral health in twins and their families. Studies of the teeth and faces of Australian twins have been continuing for nearly 30 years, with three major cohorts of twins recruited over that time, and currently we are working with twins aged 2 years old to adults. Cross-sectional data and records relating to teeth and faces of twins are available for around 300 pairs of teenage twins, as well as longitudinal data for 300 pairs of twins examined at three different stages of development, once with primary teeth, once at the mixed dentition stage, and then again when the permanent teeth had emerged. The third cohort of twins comprises over 600 pairs of twins recruited at around birth, together with other family members. The emphasis in this third group of twins has been to record the timing of emergence of the primary teeth and also to sample saliva and dental plaque to establish the timing of colonization of decay-forming bacteria in the mouth. Analyses have confirmed that genetic factors strongly influence variation in timing of primary tooth emergence. The research team is now beginning to carry out clinical examinations of the twins to see whether those who become colonized earlier with decay-forming bacteria develop dental decay at an earlier age. By making comparisons within and between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs and applying modern molecular approaches, we are now teasing out how genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors interact to influence dental development and also oral health.",

    "abstract": "To review the current literature concerning perinatal outcome of monoamniotic pregnancies with cord entanglement.\nA search in PubMed, EMBASE and MEDLINE for articles published between January 2000 and December 2011 was performed, using the following keywords: monoamniotic/monochorionic pregnancy(ies); twins; cord entanglement; fetal ultrasound/surveillance. Inclusion criteria for the study were: monoamniotic twins with documented cord entanglement at delivery, and perinatal outcome reported as proportional rates. Exclusion criteria were: higher-order multiple pregnancy; selective feticide; presence of twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence; conjoined twins; fewer than four cases in the series; and non-English language publication. Survival rates were stratified for method of prenatal management, sonographic diagnosis of cord entanglement and delivery mode. A meta-analysis was also performed using data from articles that stratified outcome according to the presence or absence of cord entanglement at birth. Comparison between neonates with cord entanglement and controls was deemed significant if the 95% CI of the pooled odds ratios did not encompass 1. MOOSE (Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines were followed.\nNine articles met the inclusion criteria for this review, including a total of 114 monoamniotic twin sets (228 fetuses) with cord entanglement. The overall survival rate was 202/228 (88.6%). Perinatal mortality occurred in 26 (11.4%) fetuses; of these, 17 (65%) died in utero and nine (35%) died at birth. Five neonatal deaths occurred as a result of prematurity, two were related to structural abnormalities and two were caused by cord entanglement. Sonographic visualization of cord entanglement did not improve outcome. Four articles were included in the meta-analysis, with no significant difference in mortality between controls (n\u2009=\u200966 fetuses) and twins with cord entanglement (n\u2009=\u200982 fetuses), and higher morbidity in controls.\nCord entanglement does not contribute to prenatal morbidity and mortality in monoamniotic twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "C\u00e2ndido God\u00f3i is a small Brazilian town known for high rates of twin birth. In 2011, a genetic study showed that this localized high rate of twin births could be explained by a genetic founder effect. Here we used isonymic analysis and surname distribution to identify population subgroups within 5316 inhabitants and 665 different surnames. Four clusters were constructed based on different twin rates (P < 0.001; MRPP test). Fisher's \u03b1 and consanguinity index showed low and high values, respectively, corresponding with observed values in isolated communities with high levels of genetic drift. Values of A and B estimators confirmed population isolation. Three boundaries were identified with Monmonier's maximum difference algorithm (P = 0.007). Inside the isolated sections, surnames of different geographic origins, language, and religion were represented. With an adequate statistical methodology, surname analyses provided a close approximation of historic and socioeconomic background at the moment of colony settlement. In this context, the maintenance of social and cultural practices had strong implications for the population's structure leading to drift processes in this small town, supporting the previous genetic study.",

    "abstract": "Although hypothyroidism is associated with increased morbidity, an association with increased mortality is still debated. Our objective was to investigate, at a nationwide level, whether a diagnosis of hypothyroidism influences mortality.\nIn an observational cohort study from January 1, 1978 until December 31, 2008 using record-linkage data from nationwide Danish health registers, 3587 singletons and 682 twins diagnosed with hypothyroidism were identified. Hypothyroid individuals were matched 1:4 with nonhypothyroid controls with respect to age and gender and followed over a mean period of 5.6 years (range 0-30 years). The hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was calculated using Cox regression analyses. Comorbidity was evaluated using the Charlson score (CS).\nIn singletons with hypothyroidism, the mortality risk was increased (HR 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41-1.65). Although the effect attenuated, hypothyroidism remained associated with increased mortality when evaluating subjects with a CS = 0 (HR 1.23; 95% CI: 1.05-1.44). In twin pairs discordant for hypothyroidism, the hypothyroid twin had excess mortality compared with the corresponding euthyroid cotwin (HR 1.40; 95% CI 0.95-2.05). However, after stratifying for zygosity, hypothyroidism was associated with excess mortality in dizygotic twin pairs (HR 1.61; 95% CI 1.00-2.58), whereas the association attenuated in monozygotic pairs (HR 1.06; 95% CI 0.55-2.05).\nHypothyroidism is associated with an excess mortality of around 50%, which to some degree is explained by comorbidity. In addition, the finding of an association between hypothyroidism and mortality within disease discordant dizygotic but not monozygotic twin pairs indicates that the association between hypothyroidism and mortality is also influenced by genetic confounding.",

    "abstract": "Twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS) complicates up to 6% of monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies, typically in the late second or third trimester. The presence of only a few and very small arteriovenous vascular anastomoses characterizes the underlying angioarchitecture at the chorionic plate in cases of TAPS. In monoamniotic twins, large vascular anastomoses can usually be seen at the placental vascular equator, and therefore one would not expect the development of TAPS in monoamniotic twins. We report a case of TAPS in a monoamniotic pregnancy at 26\u2009+\u20095 weeks' gestation which responded favorably to fetoscopic laser coagulation of the small placental anastomoses, resolving severe anemia in one twin and polycythemia in the other. The pregnancy continued until 32\u2009+\u20095 weeks, when worsening cord entanglement with increased resistance and the development of postsystolic notches in the umbilical artery of one twin prompted delivery by Cesarean section. There was only a moderate difference in neonatal hemoglobin concentrations, with the former polycythemic twin needing a single partial volume exchange transfusion. The postnatal course of the neonates was uneventful, according to their gestational age at birth. To our knowledge this is the first case report describing successful laser therapy for TAPS in monoamniotic twins.",

    "abstract": "The infant mortality rate (IMR) among single and twin births from 1999 to 2008 was analyzed using Japanese Vital Statistics. The IMR was 5.3-fold higher in twins than in singletons in 1999 and decreased to 3.9-fold in 2008. The reduced risk of infant mortality in twins relative to singletons may be related, partially, to survival rates, which improved after fetoscopic laser photocoagulation for twin - twin transfusion syndrome. The proportion of neonatal deaths among total infant deaths was 54% for singletons and 74% for twins. Thus, intensive care of single and twin births may be very important during the first month of life to reduce the IMR. The IMR decreased as gestational age (GA) rose in singletons, whereas the IMR in twins decreased as GA rose until 37 weeks and increased thereafter. The IMR was significantly higher in twins than in singletons from the shortest GA (<24 weeks) to 28 weeks as well as \u226538 weeks, whereas the IMR was significantly higher in singletons than in twins from 30 to 36 weeks. As for maternal age, the early neonatal and neonatal mortality rates as well as the IMR in singletons were significantly higher in the youngest maternal age group than in the oldest one, whereas the opposite result was obtained in twins. The lowest IMR in singletons was 1.1 per 1,000 live births for \u226538 weeks of gestation and heaviest birth weight (\u22652,000 g), while the lowest IMR in twins was 1.8 at 37 weeks and \u22652,000 g.",

A series of proportional hazards (Cox) regression models were used to analyze the associations between work-related factors and the incidence of DP.\nDuring the 30-year follow-up, 1297 participants (8%) were granted DP due to musculoskeletal diagnoses, 376 of which were due to osteoarthritis. High stress of daily activities, monotonous work, physical workload (namely work including lifting and carrying or physically heavy work), several workplace changes, and unemployment displayed a strong association with DP due to musculoskeletal diagnoses that was not affected by familial factors, including genetics and shared environment. Additionally, standing work increased the risk for DP due to osteoarthritis.\nUninfluenced by family background or other confounding factors, several work-related factors were identified as being strong and direct risk factors for DP due to musculoskeletal diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "The degree of actual intertwin birth weight (BW) or ultrasound estimated fetal weight (EFW) discordance that justifies elective delivery is yet to be established. The main aim of this study was to ascertain the performance of BW and ultrasound EFW discordance in the prediction of perinatal loss in twin pregnancies.\nThis was a retrospective study of all twin pregnancy births from a large regional cohort of nine hospitals over a 10-year period. Intertwin BW and ultrasound EFW discordance were analyzed in relation to the occurrence of stillbirth or neonatal death of one or both twins from 26\u2009weeks' gestation as obtained from a mandatory national register. Receiver-operating characteristics (ROC), survival and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the contribution of weight discordance in determining perinatal loss.\nA total of 2161 twin pregnancies were included in the analysis. The area under the ROC curve for the prediction of perinatal loss was similar for BW and ultrasound EFW discordance (P\u2009=\u20090.62). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that twins with BW or EFW of \u2265\u200925% discordance had a significantly lower survival trend than did those with lesser degrees of discordance (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The hazard ratios for the risk of total perinatal loss in twins with a BW or EFW discordance of \u2265\u200925% were 7.29 (95% CI, 4.37-12.00) and 7.28 (95% CI, 4.46-11.92), respectively. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that BW discordance and gestational age, but not chorionicity or individual fetal size percentile, were independently associated with perinatal mortality.\nAn EFW discordance of \u2265\u200925% represents the optimal cut-off for the prediction of stillbirth and neonatal mortality irrespective of chorionicity or individual fetal size. A policy of increased fetal surveillance commencing from 26\u2009weeks' gestation might be reasonable for pregnancies beyond this cut-off, but this would require confirmation in large-scale prospective trials.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of single umbilical artery (SUA) in twin pregnancies and to investigate whether SUA in twin gestations is associated with adverse obstetric outcomes.\nWe performed a retrospective cohort study of consecutive twin pregnancies over 17 years at a tertiary care hospital. Primary exposure was SUA in one or both twins documented at routine second trimester anatomic survey. Adverse obstetric outcomes included small for gestational age (SGA), placental abruption, and preterm birth, evaluated in univariable and multivariable analyses. Analysis was performed both at the pregnancy level and at the fetal level using paired analyses to account for the non-independence of twin pairs.\nOf the 2378 twin pregnancies without major anatomic abnormalities, 1.7% (n\u2009=\u200940) had SUA. Only one pregnancy (one monochorionic twin pair) was complicated by both twins having SUA. Twin fetuses with SUA are at increased risk for SGA (aOR\u2009=\u20092.1 (1.2-4.1), p\u2009=\u20090.03) after adjusting for pertinent confounding factors, similar to the findings of previous studies in singleton pregnancies. In addition, twins with SUA may be at increased risk for preterm delivery before 28 weeks compared with twin pregnancies with normal three-vessel umbilical cords (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.2 (1.3-7.89.4), p\u2009=\u20090.01).\nThe incidence of SUA in twin gestations in this cohort is significantly less than the recently published data. Similar to reports in singleton gestations, SUA appears to be associated with an increased risk for SGA in twins.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal wall reconstruction after the separation of omphalopagus conjoined twins poses a challenge for the reconstructive surgeon as separation often results in large defects involving both the skin and the abdominal wall. We describe the fabrication of a multicomponent medical model devised to simulate the various soft tissue elements and enhance presurgical planning capabilities.A life-size model was cast of omphalopagus conjoined twins including a circumferential rendition of the lower thorax and abdomen. The model consisted of a foam core simulating the density of the soft tissue with a silicone rubber skin. Tissue expanders at different stages of enlargement were sculpted onto the model to determine the amount of additional skin required. The reconstructive design elaborated on the model was used during the 20-hour operation that resulted in the twins' successful separation.We believe the creation of a customized multicomponent medical model enhances presurgical planning capabilities for complex reconstructive endeavors.",

    "abstract": "Despite the large body of research on educational differences in fertility, how genetic and environmental influences may contribute to educational differences in completed fertility is not well understood. This study examines the association between educational level and completed fertility in a sample of Finnish male and female twins born between 1950 and 1957 with register-based fertility follow-up until 2009. The results show that poorly educated men and highly educated women are least likely to have any children and have lower completed fertility in general. Behavioral genetics analysis suggests that the association between education and having any children in both sexes is influenced by factors shared by co-twins and that these factors are genetic rather than common environmental. No evidence of a causal pathway between education and having any children independent of these shared influences is found. These findings suggest that familial factors may play a role in the process through which educational differences in completed fertility are formed.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies consistently identified a relationship between parenting behavior and psychopathology. In this study, we extended prior analyses performed in female twins to a large sample of twins from male-male pairs.\nWe used interview data on 2,609 adult male twins from a population-based twin registry. We examined the association between three retrospectively reported parenting dimensions (coldness, protectiveness, and authoritarianism) and lifetime history of seven common psychiatric and substance use disorders. Using univariate structural equation modeling, we also examined the influence of the genetic and environmental factors on parenting.\nExamined individually, coldness was consistently associated with risk for a broad range of adult psychopathology. Averaged odds of psychiatric disorders associated with parenting were increased between 26 and 36 %. When the three parenting dimensions were examined together, coldness remained significant for major depression, phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder. Controlling for other disorders, the associations between the parenting dimensions and psychopathology were non-specific. Twin fitting model demonstrated that modest heritability accounted for parenting, whereas most variance resulted from the non-shared environment.\nBased on our current and prior findings, there is broad similarity in the impact of parenting on adult psychopathology between men and women.",

    "abstract": "The impact of diet on the gut microbiota has usually been assessed by subjecting people to the same controlled diet and thereafter following the shifts in the microbiota. In the present study, we used habitual dietary intake, clinical data, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to characterize the stool microbiota of Finnish monozygotic twins. The effect of diet on the numbers of bacteria was described through a hierarchical linear mixed model that included the twin individuals, stratified by body mass index, and their families as random effects. The abundance and diversity of the bacterial groups studied did not differ between normal-weight, overweight, and obese individuals with the techniques used. Intakes of energy, monounsaturated fatty acids, n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), n6 PUFAs, and soluble fiber had significant associations with the stool bacterial numbers (e.g., increased energy intake was associated with reduced numbers of Bacteroides spp.). In addition, co-twins with identical energy intake had more similar numbers and DGGE-profile diversities of Bacteroides spp. than did the co-twins with different intake. Moreover, the co-twins who ingested the same amounts of saturated fatty acids had very similar DGGE profiles of Bacteroides spp., whereas the co-twins with similar consumption of fiber had a very low bifidobacterial DGGE-profile similarity. In conclusion, our findings confirm that the diet plays an important role in the modulation of the stool microbiota, in particular Bacteroides spp. and bifidobacteria.",

    "abstract": "To determine the genetic and environmental influences exerted on arthritis by measuring the distribution of self-reported arthritis diagnoses among monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) African American twins.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted on 97 MZ and 113 DZ twin pairs recruited into the Carolina African American Twin Study of Aging (CAATSA). The sample had a mean age of 47 +/- 13.9 years. A twin design was used to determine correlations in arthritis diagnosis for MZ and DZ twins and to estimate the contribution of genes and environment to the variation in an arthritis diagnosis.\nThe concordance rate for being diagnosed with arthritis was 42% for MZ twins, and 20% for DZ twins, resulting in a 2.1:1 ratio of MZ to DZ concordance. These results indicate a significant proportion of individual variability was due to genetic factors (43%) on an arthritis diagnosis as well as 57% of variance due to nonshared environmental influences.\nThis research suggests that while there are genetic influences on arthritis diagnosis, environmental factors, such as infections, dietary factors, urbanization, and pollutants, also play a role in accounting for variability in the diagnosis and treatment of arthritis among diverse populations.",

    "abstract": "Aortic stiffness, an important predictor of cardiovascular events, may relate to aortic calcification rather than noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque. The aim of this study was to determine the relation of aortic stiffness to aortic plaque and aortic calcification in asymptomatic postmenopausal women. One hundred female twins (mean age\u00b1standard deviation 64\u00b17 years) underwent computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (black-blood sequence) of the aorta. The topographical relation of plaque on magnetic resonance images and calcification on computed tomography images was assessed on magnetic resonance/computed tomography fused images. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity was used as a measure of aortic stiffness. Aortic plaque was identified in 87% and calcification in 65% of subjects, both increased with age and were higher in the abdominal compared with thoracic aorta (P<0.0001). Plaque correlated with calcification (R=0.68; P<0.0001), but was also detected in 58% of women who had no calcification. Pulse wave velocity (adjusted for age and blood pressure) increased across quartiles of calcification (P<0.01) but not plaque score (P=0.56). Shared genetic factors accounted for >99% of the correlation (0.35) between PWV and calcification. In conclusion, there is a high prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis within the aorta in asymptomatic middle-aged women. Aortic stiffening relates to aortic calcification, but not to atherosclerotic plaque burden, and the association of aortic stiffness with calcification is driven by common genes.",

The patients had periodic evaluations after a gluten-free diet (GFD) for 16 to 21 years. Nine first-degree relatives were screened by serological tests and when positive, referred for intestinal biopsies.\nAt diagnosis, all CD patients had the classic presentation. A1/A2: scalloped duodenal mucosa with atrophic areas, Marsh III-b, after 16 years of GFD was antiendomysium antibody (EmA) negative, normal mucosa. B1/B2 at diagnosis: mucosal atrophy, Marsh III-b, after 21 years was EmA negative, decreased folds. Patient C1: decreased folds, Marsh III-b, after 16 years was EmA positive, decreased folds, admitted to gluten ingestion. A1, A2, and B1 presented dermatitis herpetiformis. The father of A1/A2 and the mother of C1/C2 were celiac.\nThe long-term follow-up of the patients allowed some observations such as the concordance for CD in MZ twins, both in relation to the time of onset and the severity of the disease. Also, the findings of serological, endoscopic, and histological analyses were similar. Dermatitis herpetiformis was present in patients with CD, with partial concordance in MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "Kabuki syndrome (OMIM 147920) is a rare disorder characterised by moderate intellectual disability, growth retardation, microcephaly and characteristic facial dysmorphic features which comprise long palpebral fissures, eversion of the lateral third of the eyelids and arched eyebrows with lateral sparseness. Mutations in MLL2 are the most frequent cause of this disorder. More than 100 MLL2 point mutations have been reported, but large intragenic deletions comprising one or more exons have not yet been identified. We report on a pair of monozygotic twin brothers in whom a deletion of 2 neighbouring exons was detected. The twins had the characteristic facial features of Kabuki syndrome, and they suffered from microcephaly, cleft lip and palate and congenital heart disease. Cleft lip and palate were left-sided in the first twin and right-sided in the second twin, i.e. they represented a mirror-image asymmetry. The intragenic deletion in these brothers broadens the spectrum of MLL2 mutations, and they provide a rare example of mirror-image asymmetry of congenital malformations in monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "During the last decades there has been a steady increase of twin births. A combination of improved medical treatment of preterm and small-for-gestational age children has contributed to a higher number of surviving twins. Prematurity is known to affect reproduction in a negative way. Few studies have focused on the potential effect twinning may have on future reproduction. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of being born a twin compared to being born a singleton have on future reproduction.\nIn a national population-based register study, all individuals born between 1973-1983 who were alive and living in Sweden at 13 years of age (n = 1 016 908) constituted the sample. Data on each study subject's own birth as well as the birth of their first offspring, and parental socio-demographic factors were collected from Swedish population based registers. Hazard ratios and corresponding 95% CI was calculated using Cox proportional hazards model.\nTwins, both men and women, had a reduced likelihood of reproducing compared to singletons (women: HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.86-0.93; men: HR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.87-0.97). This difference in birth rates can only partly be explained by diverging birth characteristics. Amongst men and women born very preterm, twins had an increased likelihood of reproducing compared to singletons (women: HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.02-1.62; men: HR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.01-1.78).\nTwins have lower reproduction rates compared to singletons, which only to a certain degree can be explained by diverging birth characteristics.",

Monozygotic and DZ twins were compared using ellipsoids representing 95% of the variation in landmark configurations and surface-based average faces. Facial symmetry was analysed by superimposing the original and mirror facial images.\nBoth analyses showed greater similarity of facial shape in MZ twins, with lower third being the least similar. Procrustes analysis did not reveal any significant difference in facial landmark configurations of MZ and DZ twins. The average faces of MZ and DZ males were coincident in the forehead, supraorbital and infraorbital ridges, the bridge of the nose and lower lip. In MZ and DZ females, the eyes, supraorbital and infraorbital ridges, philtrum and lower part of the cheeks were coincident. Zygosity did not seem to influence the amount of facial symmetry. Lower facial third was the most asymmetrical.\nThree-dimensional analyses revealed differences in facial shapes of MZ and DZ twins. The relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors is different for the upper, middle and lower facial thirds.",

Three poor-quality cleavage stage embryos were transferred resulting in monochorionic triamniotic triplets and dichorionic diamniotic twins. Selective embryo reduction was performed at 12 weeks leaving dichorionic twins. The patient underwent emergency cesarean section due to preterm labor and nonreassuring fetal heart tracing at 30 weeks of gestation. Conclusion. Our case emphasizes that even embryos with significant morphological abnormalities should be considered viable and the possibility of simultaneous spontaneous embryo splitting must be factored into determining number of embryos to transfer.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the role of heritable factors in diverticular disease. We evaluated the contribution of heritable factors to the development of diverticular disease diagnosed at a hospitalization or outpatient visit.\nUsing nationwide patient registries, we identified 142,123 incident cases of diverticular disease diagnosed at a hospitalization (1977-2011) or an outpatient hospital visit (1995-2011) in Denmark, including cases in 10,420 index siblings and 923 twins. We calculated standardized incidence ratios for siblings versus the general population and concordance rates for monozygotic versus dizygotic twin pairs as measures of relative risk (RR).\nThe RR for diverticular disease in siblings of index cases was 2.92 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.50-3.39) compared with the general population. The RRs were similar irrespective of the sex of the sibling or index case and were particularly strong in siblings of hospitalized cases and cases that underwent surgery. The proband-wise concordance rate for monozygotic twins was double that of dizygotic twins (0.16 [95% CI, 0.11-0.22] vs 0.07 [95% CI, 0.05-0.11], respectively). The RR of diverticular disease in one twin when the other had diverticular disease was 14.5 (95% CI, 8.9-23) for monozygotic twins compared with 5.5 (95% CI, 3.3-8.6) for dizygotic twins. Associations were stronger in female monozygotic twins compared with male twins (tetrachoric correlation, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.49-0.70] vs 0.33 [95% CI, 0.13-0.51]; P = .03 in an analysis stratified by sex and zygosity). We estimate that 53% (95% CI, 45%-61%) of susceptibility to diverticular disease results from genetic factors.\nBased on a population-based study in Denmark, genetic factors appear to contribute to development of diverticular disease.",

    "abstract": "Twins are often considered to be at an increased risk of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH); we therefore investigated whether multiple births have a higher incidence of DDH, and if selective ultrasound scanning should be considered for these infants.We reviewed our records of all live births between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2008 and included 25 246 single and 990 multiple births.Multiple births did not have a significantly higher incidence of DDH compared with single births (0.0030 vs 0.0023, p = 0.8939). Of the 990 multiple births, 267 had neonatal ultrasound scans and one case of DDH was diagnosed and treated successfully with a Pavlik harness. There were two late-presenting cases at eight and 14 months of age, neither of whom had risk factors for DDH and consequently had not had a neonatal scan. Whereas selective ultrasound scanning of multiple births would have led to earlier detection and treatment of the late-presenting cases, they did not have a significantly higher incidence of DDH compared with single births.We conclude that being a twin or triplet in itself is not a risk factor for DDH and that selective ultrasound scanning is not indicated for this population.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed prevalence and stability of attitudes endorsing sexual abstinence ideals from late adolescence into early adulthood and studied associations of these attitudes with religiosity and alcohol abstinence in a sexually liberal Nordic society. Our population-based sample of Finnish twins permitted comparisons of co-twins concordant for religiosity but discordant for drinking to evaluate the association of sexual abstinence ideals with alcohol abstinence, controlling for household environment. From age 17 to 24, endorsement of sexual abstinence as a romantic ideal declined from 25% to 15%. Religiosity and alcohol abstinence correlated, both separately and together, with endorsing sexual abstinence. Abstinence ideals were associated with literal belief in fundamental tenets of the Bible. The association of sexual abstinence ideals with alcohol abstinence was confirmed in within-family comparisons of co-twins discordant for drinking but concordant for religiosity. Alcohol-abstinent twins were significantly more likely than their non-alcohol-abstinent twin siblings to endorse sexual abstinence ideals; that result suggests the association of sexual abstinence ideals with abstaining from alcohol is not explained by unmeasured confounds in familial background and structure. Our longitudinal results and analyses of discordant twins suggest that attitudes toward sexual abstinence ideals are embedded within other conservative attitudes and behaviors.",

    "abstract": "We assessed cerebral asymmetry for language in 35 monozygotic twin pairs. Using DTI, we reconstructed the arcuate fasciculus in each twin. Among the male twins, right-handed pairs showed greater left-sided asymmetry of connectivity in the arcuate fasciculus than did those with discordant handedness, and within the discordant group the right-handers had greater left-sided volume asymmetry of the arcuate fasciculus than did their left-handed co-twins. There were no such effects in the female twins. Cerebral asymmetry for language showed more consistent results, with the more left-cerebrally dominant twins also showing more leftward asymmetry of high anisotropic fibers in the arcuate fasciculus, a result applying equally to female as to male twins. Reversals of arcuate fasciculus asymmetry were restricted to pairs discordant for language dominance, with the left-cerebrally dominant twins showing leftward and the right-cerebrally dominant twins rightward asymmetry of anisotropic diffusion in the arcuate fasciculus. Because monozygotic twin pairs share the same genotype, our results indicate a strong nongenetic component in arcuate fasciculus asymmetry, particularly in those discordant for cerebral asymmetry.",

    "abstract": "The associations between height and reproductive success in humans have attracted long-time scientific interest, but in addition to rather mixed previous results, little is still known about the background mechanisms of these associations. We analyzed the association of adult height with age at first birth and lifetime reproductive success using a twin study design that is able to optimally take into account family background and estimate the contributions of genetic and environmental factors. Information on live births as of June 2009 for 7,830 Finnish twins born 1950-1957 was extracted from the national population register. We found evidence for non-linear associations in men, as men in the third sex-specific height quintile had the highest probability of having one to two children, or three or more children at individual level analyses, and also to have any children when analyzing twin pairs discordant for height. Furthermore, the probability of having a spouse was highest in the third height category in men. Short stature was associated with earlier age at first birth in females, explained by correlated genetic factors, but not with lifetime number of children or having a spouse. Our results suggest that average stature may give some advantage for reproduction in males. In females, genetic factors explained the association between short stature and young age at first birth, which may suggest the role of hormonal factors.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies are at increased risk of several complications including acute or chronic twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS). Both TTTS and TAPS result from inter-twin fetofetal transfusion through the placental vascular anastomoses. In addition, MC twin pregnancies are at increased risk of having a velamentous cord insertion, which has been linked with poor perinatal outcome due to risk of rupture of the velamentous vessels. In sporadic cases, these vascular connections may have a positive effect instead of a deleterious effect. We present a case of acute fetal distress in a MC twin pregnancy caused by acute hemorrhage following rupture of velamentous vessels. An emergency cesarean section delivery was performed at 29+2 weeks' gestation. One infant was severely anemic at birth and required immediate treatment with volume expansion and blood transfusion. Acute fetal blood loss through the ruptured vessels led to an acute fetofetal transfusion from the co-twin through the placental vascular anastomoses. Delayed intervention could have resulted in severe hypovolemic shock and acute anemia in both fetuses. Instead, in the current case, placental vascular anastomoses had a transient protective role and allowed transfusion of blood from one co-twin into the circulation of the anemic twin.",

    "abstract": "Four pairs of monozygotic twins were tested for synchronous responses that occurred in the physiological data of one twin during the period when the other twin was exposed to shock and surprise stimuli. Each of the five stimuli was presented in random order, producing five blocks of trial periods within each 25-minute session per twin. There were eight possible trial periods within each block. The choice of the trial periods, that is, the exact time placement of the shock stimuli within the blocks, was determined randomly. Data from six sessions with the four pairs of twins were used by the same polygraph expert who was successful in a previous study in identifying these trial periods. In accordance with the previously determined protocol for the experiment, six of these trials were passed on, leaving 24 trial blocks for which assessments were made as to which period the stimulus had occurred. Six of these gave hits, whereas three hits were expected by chance and four of these six correct placements were made by one of the pairs of twins. The data provide further justification for a major study in this area using the outlined methodology with selected pairs of twins.",

    "abstract": "To assess the effectiveness and feasibility of retaining a singleton or twins for multifetal pregnancy reduction (MFPR) in triplet pregnancy with monochorionic twins.\nThis retrospective study was conducted from January 2006 to September 2011 at a university reproductive medical center. Multifetal pregnant patients (n=35) with dichorionic triplets underwent MFPR in the first trimester to reduce one or both monochorionic twins. These cases were divided into two groups: Group A (9 MFPR cases to reduce one monochorionic twin) and Group B (26 MFPR for both monochorionic twins). Control A (for Group A) included another 18 cases of trichorionic triplet reduction to twins; Control B (for Group B) included 35 cases of trichorionic triplet reduction to singletons. MFPR was performed during the same period for all groups. Pregnancy outcomes were compared between groups.\nPatients were 28-39 years old; the average gestation for fetal reduction was 6-8 weeks. The early abortion rate was lower in Group A than Group B (0 versus 11.5%, p=0.339), but the late abortion rate was significantly higher in Group A. (33.3% versus 0, p=0.000). Groups A and B did not differ significantly in premature labor rate, term birth rate, gestation at delivery and take-home baby rate. The rate of very low and low birth weight was significantly higher in Group A than Group B (50% versus 0, p=0.001), and the average birth weight was significantly lower in Group A (2391.7\u00b1318.5 versus 3119.6\u00b1523.9, p=0.001). Group A had significantly more low birth-weight newborns than Control A (50% versus 13.3%, p<0.05 [0.024]). Group B (retained singleton) had similar pregnancy outcomes and neonatal conditions as Control B.\nRetaining a singleton is always the best choice when deciding about using MFPR to improve pregnancy outcomes. For patients having a triplet pregnancy with monochorionic twins and strongly desiring to keep twins, MFPR in one monochorionic twin was feasible by aspirating embryonic parts early in gestation (6-8 weeks) with no drug injection. Pregnancy outcomes are similar with twin reduction in trichorionic triplet pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical findings in a set of monozygotic twins with autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV) over a 23-year period.\nA pair of female twins were examined between 26 and 49 years of age. The concordance and discordance of their clinical features were determined. The CAPN5 gene was sequenced using genomic DNA.\nBoth twins of an affected father demonstrated Stage I ADNIV with mild vitreous cells and a negative b-wave on electroretinography. Genetic analysis confirmed a guanine to thymine nucleotide (c.728G>T, pArg243Leu) mutation in the CAPN5 gene. Over the course of 23 years, each twin progressed to stage III disease, showing posterior uveitis, cystoid macular edema, intraocular fibrosis, early retinal neovascularization, retinal degeneration, and cataract. Disease progression varied moderately between each twin and was asymmetrical between eyes. Twin A had 20/70 and 20/125 in the right and left eye, respectively, and underwent vitrectomy surgery and intravitreal injections with bevacizumab for recurrent cystoid macular edema. Twin B maintained 20/20 and 20/40 in the right and left eye, respectively without intervention.\nThere was asymmetry between the eyes and some discordance in the rate of disease progression in these monozygotic twins with ADNIV. The overall high disease concordance suggests genetic factors play a major role in clinical manifestations in CAPN5 vitreoretinopathy.",

    "abstract": "Aspartylglucosaminuria is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder leading early to a progressive intellectual disability. Monozygous Qatari twins presented with an unusual perinatal manifestation characterized by severe muscular hypotonia, scarce spontaneous movements, multiple contractures, and respiratory insufficiency. Biochemical investigations suggested aspartylglucosaminuria, and a novel homozygous mutation c.439T>C (p.S147P) was found in the aspartylglucosaminidase gene. However, it cannot be excluded that the unusual neonatal presentation is due to an additional autosomal recessive disease in this multiply consanguineous family. The classical aspartylglucosaminuria phenotype (progressive speech delay, psychomotor retardation, and behavioral abnormalities) was observed in 3 Turkish siblings. Although aspartylglucosaminuria was suspected early, the definite diagnosis was not confirmed until the age of 18 years. A novel homozygous mutation c.346C>T (p.R116W) was found. These 5 cases emphasize that aspartylglucosaminuria is panethnic and may possibly present with prenatal manifestation. Screening for aspartylglucosaminuria should be done in all patients with unexplained psychomotor retardation.",

    "abstract": "Soluble fractalkine (sFRACT) is involved in the pathogenesis of several clinical diseases. Our major objective was to determine to what extent its variation is governed by genetic factors and whether this genetic variation could be attributable to SNPs in five candidate genes: CX3CL1, CX3CR1, ADAM10, ADAM17 and AREG.\nPlasma levels of sFRACT and 38 SNPs, with minor allele frequency >0.1 were examined in a large twin sample drawn from the general UK population. The discovery sample included 3306 middle-aged females: 1172 MZ twins and 2134 DZ twins. A replication sample of 1675 twins was used to validate the major association results obtained in genetic association analysis in the discovery sample. We implemented variance component analysis to estimate contribution of putative genetic, (including above SNPs) and environmental factors to sFRACT variation.\nsFRACT was found not to vary with either age or BMI. Putative genetic factors (heritability) explained 43.6\u00b13% of the total variation of plasma sFRACT levels. However, we found no evidence of association between sFRACT and any of the examined SNPs, despite having >85% power to detect an association of just 1% of the variance explained. The results in the discovery and replication samples were in good agreement suggesting these findings are real.\nOur results suggest involvement of genetic factors to inter-individual variation of sFRACT levels in a general human population. However, further studies are required to determine genetic polymorphisms affecting sFRACT variation.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia. Several studies have shown association of genetic variants with AF and that familial AF increases the risk of AF. We have previously shown a substantial heritability of AF in a twin study. The objective of this study was to determine whether having a co-twin with AF influences mortality.\nWe identified all Danish twins with AF born during and after 1912 in the Danish Twin Registry, the National Patient Registry, and the Central Office of Civil Registration. For each twin, we randomly identified 4 twins without AF, matched on sex, zygosity, and age. We compared survival among the co-twins of the affected twins (co-cases, n=2164) and the co-twins of the unaffected twins (co-controls, n=8626). The co-cases showed increased death rates compared with the co-controls (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.30; P<0.0001), and this effect was more pronounced in monozygotic twins (hazard ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.55; P=0.003), compared with dizygotic same sex (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.29; P=0.006) and opposite sex twins (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.47; P=0.093).\nThe mortality rate was 20% higher in twins who had a co-twin with AF than in twins without familial AF. This effect was almost doubled in monozygotic twins compared with dizygotic twins, suggesting the influence of genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins discordant for type 2 diabetes constitute an ideal model to study environmental contributions to type 2 diabetic traits. We aimed to examine whether global DNA methylation differences exist in major glucose metabolic tissues from these twins.\nSkeletal muscle (n = 11 pairs) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (n = 5 pairs) biopsies were collected from 53-80 year-old monozygotic twin pairs discordant for type 2 diabetes. DNA methylation was measured by microarrays at 26,850 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites in the promoters of 14,279 genes. Bisulfite sequencing was applied to validate array data and to quantify methylation of intergenic repetitive DNA sequences. The overall intra-pair variation in DNA methylation was large in repetitive (LINE1, D4Z4 and NBL2) regions compared to gene promoters (standard deviation of intra-pair differences: 10% points vs. 4% points, P<0.001). Increased variation of LINE1 sequence methylation was associated with more phenotypic dissimilarity measured as body mass index (r = 0.77, P = 0.007) and 2-hour plasma glucose (r = 0.66, P = 0.03) whereas the variation in promoter methylation did not associate with phenotypic differences. Validated methylation changes were identified in the promoters of known type 2 diabetes-related genes, including PPARGC1A in muscle (13.9\u00b16.2% vs. 9.0\u00b14.5%, P = 0.03) and HNF4A in adipose tissue (75.2\u00b13.8% vs. 70.5\u00b13.7%, P<0.001) which had increased methylation in type 2 diabetic individuals. A hypothesis-free genome-wide exploration of differential methylation without correction for multiple testing identified 789 and 1,458 CpG sites in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, respectively. These methylation changes only reached some percentage points, and few sites passed correction for multiple testing.\nOur study suggests that likely acquired DNA methylation changes in skeletal muscle or adipose tissue gene promoters are quantitatively small between type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic twins. The importance of methylation changes in candidate genes such as PPARGC1A and HNF4A should be examined further by replication in larger samples.",

In the discordant twin pair analyses, commercial work was significantly associated with lower risk of DP (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.95).\nOne unit increase in job demands and working in the occupational groups healthcare and social work or service and military work seem to be risk factors of DP with mental diagnoses, independent from various background factors including familial ones.

    "abstract": "To assess perinatal outcome in type II monochorionic (MC) diamniotic twin pregnancies (DA) affected by selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) and abnormal cord insertion managed expectantly.\nA prospective longitudinal study from June 2008 and July 2011 on 24 MCDA sIUGR twins. sIUGR was defined as estimated fetal weight below the 10th percentile in one twin and was classified into three groups based on umbilical artery (UA) Doppler diastolic flow (I: presence; II: constantly absent/reverse (AEDF/ARED); III: intermittently absent or reverse). Marginal cord insertion was defined as insertion within 2 cm of the placental disc edge, and velamentous insertion as a cord insertion into the fetal membranes. Expectant management was chosen in these twins, and absent or reverse A wave in the ductus venosus (DV) was a criterion for delivery. Neonatal outcome was available for all twins delivered. Pathological examination and vascular cast of placentas were performed in all cases.\nFourteen twin pregnancies were type II sIUGR, and ten presented an abnormal umbilical cord insertion. Median gestational age (GA) at diagnosis of sIUGR was 18 weeks' gestation (range 16-20 weeks), and all sIUGR co-twins showed AEDF of UA at a median gestational age of 20 weeks (range 18-22 weeks). Median gestational age at delivery was 30 weeks (range 28-34 weeks) with a median birth weight of 1285 g (range 307-1725 g). pH at birth and base excess (BE) were normal in all IUGR co-twin (pH>7.10, median BE 5.5); Apgar score at 5 min was >7. Perinatal outcome was favorable in all cases. Placental pathological examination confirmed the marginal insertion of the umbilical cord and the absence of anastomosis between the two portions of umbilical insertion.\nThis study highlights that expectant management for sIUGR type II twins with or without an abnormal cord insertion should be a valid option to time delivery for these fetuses as shown by the favorable neonatal outcome.",

Median gestational age (GA) at diagnosis of sIUGR was 18 weeks' gestation (range 16-20 weeks), and all sIUGR co-twins showed AEDF of UA at a median gestational age of 20 weeks (range 18-22 weeks). Median gestational age at delivery was 30 weeks (range 28-34 weeks) with a median birth weight of 1285 g (range 307-1725 g). pH at birth and base excess (BE) were normal in all IUGR co-twin (pH>7.10, median BE 5.5); Apgar score at 5 min was >7. Perinatal outcome was favorable in all cases. Placental pathological examination confirmed the marginal insertion of the umbilical cord and the absence of anastomosis between the two portions of umbilical insertion.",

    "abstract": "With the increased birth rate of twins during the recent decades and improved prognosis of preterm infants, there is a need to explore measures that could optimise their growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. It has been postulated that co-bedding simulates the twins' intrauterine experiences in which co-regulatory behaviours between the twins are observed. These behaviours are proposed to benefit the twins by reducing their stress, which may promote growth and development. However, uncertainties exist on the benefit-risk profile of co-bedding in practice.\nWe aimed to assess the effects of co-bedding on growth, and other clinically relevant physiological and neurodevelopmental outcomes for stable preterm twins.\nWe used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (CNRG). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (hosted by EBCHOST), CINAHL and references cited in our shortlisted articles using keywords and MesH headings, up to July 2012.\nWe included randomised controlled trials with randomisation either at the level of each twin pair and/or at the level of neonatal unit. We excluded cross-over studies.\nWe extracted data using the standard methods of the CNRG. Two review authors independently assessed the relevance and risk of bias of the retrieved records. We contacted the authors of the included studies if important information was missing from their published papers. We expressed our results using risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) where appropriate with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We adjusted the unit of analysis from individual infants to twin pairs by averaging the measurement for each twin pair (continuous outcome) or by counting the outcome as positive if any of the twins developed the outcome (dichotomous outcome).\nFive studies met the inclusion criteria; however, data were only available for analysis in four studies. Four of the five included studies were small and had significant limitations in design. As each study reported the outcomes differently, data for most of the outcomes were effectively contributed by a single study. There were no differences between co-bedded twins and twins that received separate care in the rate of weight gain (MD 0.20 grams/kg/day, 95% CI: -1.60 to 2.00), apnoea, bradycardia and desaturation (A/B/D) episodes (RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.18 to 4.05; 1 study), length of hospital stay (MD -4.90 days, 95% CI: -35.23 to 25.43) and infection rates (typical RR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.30 to 2.31; 3 studies). There were also no differences in parental perceptions of care. Co-bedded twins appeared to spend more time crying, but they also seemed to spend more time in quiet sleep. There was low or very low quality of evidence across all the outcomes.\nThere was insufficient evidence on the benefits and harms of co-bedding stable preterm twins to make any recommendation in practice. There is a need for future studies that are adequately powered to detect clinically important differences in growth and neurodevelopment. Such studies should also assess harms including infections and medication errors, and caregiver satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "Twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence, is a rare malformation occurring in monozygotic multiple gestations. One well-developed normal (pump) twin and the other twin with absent cardiac structure (acardiac), who is hemodynamically dependent on the normal (pump) twin are characteristic of this syndrome. The acardiac twin develops multiple anomalies that make survival difficult. The prognosis of the pump twin is variable with mortality rate ranging from 50% to 70%. Complications that affect the prognosis of the pump twin include complications of congestive cardiac failure due to increased cardiac demand, prematurity secondary to preterm delivery, and polyhydramnios. Because of these complications prompt detection, follow-up, and treatment of this condition is very important. We report two cases of TRAP sequence that emphasizes the importance of gray-scale and color Doppler imaging in diagnosis, detection of poor prognostic features, follow-up, and management of TRAP sequence.",

    "abstract": "T cells mediate the inflammatory responses observed in asthma among genetically susceptible individuals and have been suspected to be prone to epigenetic regulation. However, these relationships are not well established from past clinical studies that have had limited capacity to control for the effects of variable genetic predisposition and early environmental exposures. Relying on a cohort of monozygotic twins discordant for asthma we sought to determine if epigenetic modifications in T cells were associated with current asthma and explored whether such modifications were associated with second hand smoke exposures. Our study was conducted in a monozygotic twin cohort of adult twin pairs (n\u200a=\u200a21) all discordant for asthma. Regulatory T cell (Treg) and effector T cell (Teff) subsets were assessed for levels of cellular function, protein expression, gene expression and CpG methylation within Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) and interferon gamma-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) loci. Comparisons by asthma and current report of exposure to second hand smoke were made. Treg from asthmatic discordant twins demonstrated decreased FOXP3 protein expression and impaired Treg function that was associated with increased levels of CpG methylation within the FOXP3 locus when compared to their non-asthmatic twin partner. In parallel, Teff from discordant asthmatic twins demonstrated increased methylation of the IFN\u03b3 locus, decreased IFN\u03b3 expression and reduced Teff function when compared to Teff from the non-asthmatic twin. Finally, report of current exposure to second hand smoke was associated with modifications in both Treg and Teff at the transcriptional level among asthmatics. The results of the current study provide evidence for differential function of T cell subsets in monozygotic twins discordant for asthma that are regulated by changes in DNA methylation. Our preliminary data suggest exposure to second hand smoke may augment the modified T cell responses associated with asthma.",

    "abstract": "Childhood adverse experiences are known to induce persistent changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity to stress. However, the mechanisms by which these experiences shape the neuroendocrine response to stress remain unclear. Method We tested whether bullying victimization influenced serotonin transporter gene (SERT) DNA methylation using a discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin design. A subsample of 28 MZ twin pairs discordant for bullying victimization, with data on cortisol and DNA methylation, were identified in the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally representative 1994-1995 cohort of families with twins.\nBullied twins had higher SERT DNA methylation at the age of 10 years compared with their non-bullied MZ co-twins. This group difference cannot be attributed to the children's genetic makeup or their shared familial environments because of the study design. Bullied twins also showed increasing methylation levels between the age of 5 years, prior to bullying victimization, and the age of 10 years whereas no such increase was detected in non-bullied twins across time. Moreover, children with higher SERT methylation levels had blunted cortisol responses to stress.\nOur study extends findings drawn from animal models, supports the hypothesis that early-life stress modifies DNA methylation at a specific cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site in the SERT promoter and HPA functioning and suggests that these two systems may be functionally associated.",

    "abstract": "Aim. To identify risk factors for urticaria, to determine the relative proportion of the susceptibility to urticaria that is due to genetic factors in an adult clinical twin sample, and to further determine whether the genetic susceptibility to urticaria overlaps with the genetic susceptibility to atopic diseases. Methods. A total of 256 complete twin pairs and 63 single twins, who were selected from sibships with self-reported asthma via a questionnaire survey of 21,162 adult twins from the Danish Twin Registry, were clinically interviewed about a history of urticaria and examined for atopic diseases. Data were analysed with Cox proportional hazards regression and variance components models. Results. A total of 151 individuals (26%) had a history of urticaria, whereas 24 (4%) had had symptoms within the past year. Female sex, HR = 2.09 (1.46-2.99), P = 0.000; hay fever, HR = 1.92 (1.36-2.72), P = 0.000; and atopic dermatitis, HR = 1.44 (1.02-2.06), P = 0.041 were significant risk factors for urticaria. After adjustment for sex and age at onset of urticaria in the index twin, the risk of urticaria was increased in MZ cotwins relative to DZ cotwins, HR = 1.42 (0.63-3.18), P = 0.394. Genetic factors explained 45% (16-74%), P = 0.005, of the variation in susceptibility to urticaria. The genetic correlation between urticaria and hay fever was 0.45 (0.01-0.89), P = 0.040. Conclusions. Susceptibility to urticaria is partly determined by genetic factors. Urticaria is more common in women, and in subjects with hay fever and atopic dermatitis, and shares genetic variance with hay fever.",

    "abstract": "The disposable soma theory proposes a trade-off between fertility and longevity but existing findings on this association have been mixed. This study used data from 15,622 twins born between 1901 and 1925 ascertained from the population-based Swedish Twin Registry to test the child-longevity association and whether it is accounted for by individual-level factors or by genetic and environmental factors shared by family members. Based on survival analysis, both women and men with children had significantly longer survival relative to the childless, with a slightly higher relative advantage in men. Adjustments for demographic factors and cotwin fertility did not mediate the parenting-survival association, indicating that this association is attributable to individual-level factors associated with fertility rather than family-level environmental or genetic factors shared by cotwins. These results, derived from a large, population-based sample, are inconsistent with the disposable soma theory as applied to modern human populations.",

    "abstract": "Aortic coarctation is a congenital defect which rarely presents in adulthood but results in significant morbidity and mortality. Endovascular techniques present novel therapeutic options for managing this anomaly with comparable results to traditional open surgical repair.\nWe convey a case of postductal aortic coarctation in a symptomatic 31-year-old woman, undetected, despite 27 years history of congenital bicuspid valve with aortic incompetence. We staged a successful endovascular repair following presentation with hypertension, abdominal pain, and worsening lower limb claudication. This lady recovered well, eventually giving birth to twins after a successful caesarean section delivery. The anatomical, clinical and technical features of the case are appraised.\nAortic coarctation is classified anatomically as preductal (infantile) or postductal (adult) and the morphological spectrum of abnormality ranges from a discrete stenosis distal to the left subclavian to a hypoplastic transverse arch and aortic isthmus presenting in infancy. Its incidence is 0.2-0.6 per 100 live births. Traditional open surgical repair of aortic coarctation is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Advances in endovascular techniques with their associated shorter hospital time and lower costs, reduced short term morbidity and mortality mean that they are likely to become mainstays of treatment.\nThe presentation of aortic coarctation for the first time in an adult is extremely unusual. Error and delayed diagnosis can never be fully exempted in the practice of medicine even with the most advanced diagnostic tools. Follow-up is mandatory by trans-oesophageal echo in all endovascular patients.",

Recent reports have shown that there are genomic and epigenomic differences between monozygotic twins. Genomic/epigenomic and gene expression analyses were performed in monozygotic twins discordant for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) to find the genes playing important roles in SLE pathogenesis. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and copy number variation (CNV) typing, CpG methylation and gene expression were analyzed. The discordances in SNPs and CNVs were not confirmed. Both CpG methylation and gene expression levels were different for 10 genes. There were no genomic differences between monozygotic twins discordant for SLE, but epigenomic and gene expression differences were detected. These findings provide information for better understanding of SLE pathogenesis.",

Results showed significant between-sibling differences for sentence durations and F0 parameters; however, Euclidean distance (ED) measures revealed the smallest distances between the F0 parameters of the MZ twins. The smallest ED values were also observed between T1 and T2 for word durations, pause durations, all-voiced sample durations, and all the all-voiced sample F0 parameters. Greater similarities were observed across all three siblings for the speech tempo and dynamic F0 parameters.",

    "abstract": "The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiota acts like a virtual organ and is suggested to be of great importance in human energy balance and weight control. This study included 40 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs to investigate the influence of the human genotype on GI microbiota structure as well as microbial signatures for differences in body mass index (BMI). Phylogenetic microarraying based on 16S rRNA genes demonstrated that MZ twins have more similar microbiotas compared with unrelated subjects (P<0.001), which allowed the identification of 35 genus-like microbial groups that are more conserved between MZ twins. Half of the twin pairs were selected on discordance in terms of BMI, which revealed an inverse correlation between Clostridium cluster IV diversity and BMI. Furthermore, relatives of Eubacterium ventriosum and Roseburia intestinalis were positively correlated to BMI differences, and relatives of Oscillospira guillermondii were negatively correlated to BMI differences. Lower BMI was associated with a more abundant network of primary fiber degraders, while a network of butyrate producers was more prominent in subjects with higher BMI. Combined with higher butyrate and valerate contents in the fecal matter of higher BMI subjects, the difference in microbial networks suggests a shift in fermentation patterns at the end of the colon, which could affect human energy homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "PRRT2 gene mutations have recently been identified as a causative gene of Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), a rare movement disorder characterised by the occurrence of chorea, dystonia or athetosis triggered by sudden action. Some patients have additional intermittent neurologic disorders like infantile convulsions. The association with migraine has been rarely reported in this condition. Here we report the coexistence of PKD and hemiplegic migraine in twins harbouring a heterozygous mutation in PRRT2. Two monozygotic twins manifesting PKD together with repeated episodes of migraine with some severe attacks of hemiplegic migraine have been followed and treated for more than 10 years. Molecular genetic analysis disclosed the c.649_650insC, p.R217Pfs*8 heterozygous mutation in both twins. This mutation was segregating from the mother who likewise harboured the same mutation c.649dupC although she had never manifested PKD but complained of rare common migraine attacks in her past history. The association of PKD and hemiplegic migraine has been previously reported in one large family, associated to febrile convulsions and afebrile seizures in some individuals, but our report relates this association of symptoms to a mutation in PRRT2. The co-occurrence of both hemiplegic migraine and PKD in monozygotic twins expands the phenotypic spectrum of intermittent manifestations related to PRRT2 and perhaps suggests an additional causing gene for hemiplegic migraine.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a diagnosis with a set of symptoms of aberrant psychological phenomena. Here, we discuss that there may be an imbalance of proteostasis of neurons in the brain leading to increase in membrane shedding and buildup of microparticles (MPs) appearing in the cerebrospinal fluid. The number of MPs can be determined and their phenotypes verified by size and membrane expression with flow cytometry. This is the first report of specified MPs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in schizophrenia. Two 56-year-old Swedish-born female monozygotic twins of Caucasian ethnicity with onset of schizophrenia more than 30years ago were studied. Three fractions of fresh CSF were examined for microparticles by flow cytometry analysis, which measure the specific binding of antibodies to CD42a (platelet-MP; 33 GPIX), CD144 (endothelial-MP; Ve-cadherin), CD45 (leukocyte-MP; pan-leukocyte antigen) and of phosphatidylserine to lactadherin. The patients with schizophrenia displayed more phosphatidylserine-positive MPs in CSF compared with healthy control subjects. The scanning electron microscopic (SEM) structures in CSF studied over a 3-year period in twins with schizophrenia were of similar appearance at both time points. The increased number of MPs in fresh CSF may be a sign of enhanced membrane shedding in the central nervous system. Such MPs can be investigated for both human and non-human DNA, RNA and microRNA that may activate different immune signaling systems in patients with schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Rates of twinning have risen dramatically over the last 30 years, from 1 in 53 births in 1980 to 1 in 30 births in 2009 (Martin et al. (January 2012). Three decades of twin births in the United States, 1980-2009. Atlanta, GA: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics). This increase is largely attributable to increases in the use of fertility treatments (i.e., ovulation induction and in vitro fertilization) combined with delays in parenthood. Although this increase means that more twins are available for recruitment into twin studies, it also has potential consequences for the heritability estimates obtained in these studies. This study sought to evaluate this possibility, making use of the ongoing Michigan Twins Project (N = 7,261 families with twins aged 3-17 years), an arm of the Michigan State University Twin Registry. Results revealed that, on average, twins conceived via fertility treatments had lower rates of behavior problems than those conceived naturally, although these behavioral differences could be explained largely by demographic and socio-economic differences across the two types of twin families. Twin similarity did not meaningfully differ across fertility treatment status. We thus conclude that estimates of genetic and environmental influences obtained from twin studies over the last 10-15 years are more or less unaffected by the inclusion of twins conceived via fertility treatments in their samples.",

    "abstract": "The Peri/postnatal Epigenetic Twins Study (PETS) is a longitudinal cohort of 250 pairs of Australian twins and their mothers, who were recruited mid-way through pregnancy from January 2007 to September 2009. The study is centered on the developmental origins of health and disease paradigm (DOHaD) in which an adverse intrauterine environment predisposes the individual to complex disease in later life by reducing growth in utero and adversely altering developmental plasticity. Data concerning diet and lifestyle were collected from mothers during pregnancy, and samples of plasma and serum taken at 28 weeks' gestation. We attended 75% of all births, at which time we collected multiple biological samples including placenta, cord blood, and neonatal cheek cells, the latter from 91% of pairs. Chorionicity was recorded and zygosity was determined by DNA testing where necessary. Approximately 40% of the twins are monozygotic, two-thirds of which are dichorionic. Twins were seen again at 18 months of age and repeat blood and cheek swabs taken where possible. Studies of gene expression and the epigenetic marks of DNA methylation have so far revealed that twins exhibit a wide range of epigenetic discordance at birth, that one-third of the epigenome changes significantly between birth and 18 months; shared (maternal) environment, genetic factors, and non-shared intrauterine environment contribute to an increasing proportion of epigenetic variation at birth, respectively, and affect tissues differently, and that within-pair birth weight discordance correlates with epigenetic discordance in genes associated with lipid metabolism, supporting an epigenetic mechanism for DOHaD.",

    "abstract": "Brain size, white matter hyperintensity, and the development of brain atrophy are known to be highly heritable. The decrease of brain volume starts from the very onset of multiple sclerosis and is 10-fold compared with normal aging. The aim of this study was to assess whether the brain and spinal cord volumes and the volume of white matter lesions differed between twins with multiple sclerosis and their asymptomatic co-twins.\nA co-twin control method was used to evaluate whether the brain and spinal cord volumes differ between twins with multiple sclerosis and their co-twins. Nineteen twin pairs were studied neurologically, and the volumes of T1, T2, FLAIR, and gadolinium-enhanced lesions and those of the brain and the spinal cord were obtained by magnetic resonance imaging.\nSignificant differences in the brain (P=0.064) or spinal cord (P=0.648) volumes were not detected. Four of the 7 monozygotic and 5 of the 12 dizygotic co-twins had focal brain white matter lesions, but none fulfilled the magnetic resonance imaging criteria of Barkhof. Spinal cord lesions were not seen in any of the co-twins.\nThe absence of a significant difference in the brain or spinal cord volume between the twins with multiple sclerosis and their co-twins supports the recent observation of brain size and the development of brain atrophy being highly heritable.",

    "abstract": "The separation of craniopagus conjoined twins is a very rare and complex challenge. As with many rare challenges, it presents initially as a deceptively simple problem requiring only the most basic clinical techniques. As in many reconstructive problems, this paradigm mandates that the neurosurgical team performs the separation with the plastic surgeons providing closure at the end of the separation. Historically, these approaches have included, as with the separation of many other types of conjoined twins, the use of tissue expansion before separation followed by separation surgery. In the best hands, at the most capable medical centers, the mortality reported in the literature for the past 50 years is greater than 50%. Craniofacial surgery frequently demands a coordinated effort between plastic surgery and neurosurgery and many other specializations; separating craniopagus twins takes this coordination to a stratospheric level. It is, however, this coordination that is of paramount importance. Success clearly requires an understanding of the complex interrelationship between the \"separation\" and the \"reconstruction\" and that decisions made for 1 aspect of the surgery will have a profound impact on another aspect of the surgery. The impact can be disastrous or, if planned well, can be advantageous.We were contacted to evaluate craniopagus conjoined male infant twins for separation. Radiographic studies suggested that the brains were separate, and their medical team suggested that they were \"fit for separation.\" We reviewed the literature and reviewed our colleagues' experiences with similar cases around the world. It became clear that whether separation had been unsuccessful or successful, a variety of issues accompanied surgery as follows: (1) massive intraoperative hemorrhage, (2) cerebral edema, (3) venous infarcts, (4) swelling of flaps, and (5) dehiscence of repairs with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, meningitis, or brain exposure. Although the initial plan was to separate the twins in the same fashion as in previous cases (ie, single-stage separation surgery preceded by tissue expansion of the scalp), it was clear that this approach increases cerebral venous pressure during the separation component of surgery and therefore set up a cascade of events favoring failure rather than success. Wishing to favor success, we elected to design an open-ended multistaged separation to improve venous collateral circulation. We believe that this would improve venous drainage, prevent increased venous pressure, diminish cerebral edema, and favor the integrity of the dura and flap repair that would in turn lessen the risk of CSF leak. The stages would also allow the twins to recover from each stage before progressing to the next stage while continuing to receive nutritional support and physical therapy. Four major stages for 9 \u00bd months led to their successful separation. There has been no CSF leak or meningitis. To our knowledge, this technique has since been applied to 2 other sets of craniopagus with similar outcomes.A review of the pertinent literature, our rationale, and methodology are discussed in this article.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes home sleeping arrangements used by parents of twins and investigates whether room sharing (twins in the same room as parents) or cobedding (crib-sharing between twins) influences parental night time sleep duration or sleep quality. A secondary analysis of data obtained from a longitudinal study of sleep in 104 families with twins was undertaken. Over 65% of twins were cobedded at 4 weeks; this decreased to approximately 42% by 13 weeks of age. Approximately 64% of families practiced room sharing at 4 weeks, this decreased to approximately 40% by 13 weeks of age. Mothers and fathers who both room shared and cobedded their twins at 9 weeks of age were most likely to experience restricted sleep duration when compared to other sleeping arrangements. Results suggest that parents of twins may not be following the most recent AAP recommendations regarding safe infant sleep for multiple birth infants.",

At the same time, recent studies have found that numerous preconception or prenatal environmental factors affect the probability of a baby being conceived male or female. I propose that these environmental factors also explain sex differences in mortality. I contribute a new methodology of distinguishing between child biology and preconception environment by comparing male-female differences in mortality across opposite-sex twins, same-sex twins, and all twins. Using a large sample of twins from sub-Saharan Africa, I find that both preconception environment and child biology increase the mortality of male infants, but the effect of biology is substantially smaller than the literature suggests. I also estimate the interacting effects of biology with some intrauterine and external environmental factors, including birth order within a twin pair, social status, and climate. I find that a twin is more likely to be male if he is the firstborn, born to an educated mother, or born in certain climatic conditions. Male firstborns are more likely to survive than female firstborns, but only during the neonatal period. Finally, mortality is not affected by the interactions between biology and climate or between biology and social status.",

    "abstract": "Identifying genetic and metabolic biomarkers in neonates has the potential to improve diagnosis and treatment of common complex neonatal diseases, and potentially lead to risk assessment and preventative measures for common adulthood illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is a wealth of information on using fatty acid, amino acid and organic acid metabolite profiles to identify rare inherited congenital diseases through newborn screening, but little is known about these metabolic profiles in the context of the 'healthy' newborn. Recent studies have implicated many of the amino acid and fatty acid metabolites utilized in newborn screening in common complex adult diseases such as cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and obesity. To determine the heritability of metabolic profiles in newborns, we examined 381 twin pairs obtained from the Iowa Neonatal Metabolic Screening Program. Heritability was estimated using multilevel mixed-effects linear regression adjusting for gestational age, gender, weight and age at time of sample collection. The highest heritability was for short-chain acylcarnitines, specifically C4 (h\u00b2=0.66, P=2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076), C4-DC (h\u00b2=0.83, P<10\u207b\u00b9\u2076) and C5 (h\u00b2=0.61, P=1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079). Thyroid stimulating hormone (h\u00b2=0.58, P=2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075) and immunoreactive trypsinogen (h\u00b2=0.52, P=3 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079) also have a strong genetic component. This is direct evidence for a strong genetic contribution to the metabolic profile at birth and that newborn screening data can be utilized for studying the genetic regulation of many clinically relevant metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Studies of synchronous physiological responses to startle stimuli between monozygotic twins and other paired subjects have suffered from methodological flaws such as post-hoc specifications of \"connectedness\" criteria. The mechanisms that affect any such connectedness are unknown. With the logistic and financial support of a television company, we conducted a methodological pilot study with predefined objective hit criteria in which we used four pairs of twins with frequent experiences of connectedness.\nWhile one twin was exposed during a 12-minute period to five randomly presented mild shock or surprise stimuli, the electrodermal activity, blood pressure, breathing, and bodily movements were simultaneously recorded in the second twin. An authorized polygraph expert who was blind to the stimulus exposure times examined the data for deviations from normal physiological patterns during relaxation and delivered precisely timed estimates of such deviations. \"Hits\" (indications of connectedness) were objectively defined as an estimate lying within a 15-second \"hit window.\"\nOverall results were nonsignificant, P > .7. However, for one pair of twins, the polygraph expert identified 10 deviating patterns, of which three were hits were P < .03. This data set was sent to a second, independent expert, who blindly identified the same three hits, pointing to only eight patterns, P < .0003.\nWe argue that the applied methodology for \"hit\" identification is objective and recommendable. Speculatively, because the \"successful\" pair of twins was reported to be monochorionic-monoamnionic (as embryos, they shared the same placenta and the same bag of water), embryonic history might be further investigated as a potential factor for connectedness between monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies in twins indicate that non-shared environment, beyond genetic factors, contributes substantially to individual variation in mutagen sensitivity; however, the role of specific causative factors (e.g. tobacco smoke, diet) was not elucidated. In this investigation, a population of 22 couples of monozygotic twins with discordant smoking habits was selected with the aim of evaluating the influence of tobacco smoke on individual response to DNA damage. The study design virtually eliminated the contribution of genetic heterogeneity to the intra-pair variation in DNA damage response, and thus any difference in the end-points investigated could directly be attributed to the non-shared environment experienced by co-twins, which included as main factor cigarette smoke exposure. Peripheral lymphocytes of study subjects were challenged ex vivo with \u03b3-rays, and the induction, processing, fixation of DNA damage evaluated through multiple approaches. Folate status of study subjects was considered significant covariate since it is affected by smoking habits and can influence radiosensitivity. Similar responses were elicited by \u03b3-rays in co-twins for all the end-points analysed, despite their discordant smoking habits. Folate status did not modify DNA damage response, even though a combined effect of smoking habits, low-plasma folic acid level, and ionising radiation was observed on apoptosis. A possible modulation of DNA damage response by duration and intensity of tobacco smoke exposure was suggested by Comet assay and micronucleus data, but the effect was quantitatively limited. Overall, the results obtained indicate that differences in smoking habits do not contribute to a large extent to inter-individual variability in the response to radiation-induced DNA damage observed in healthy human populations.",

Mailed or hand-delivered questionnaires, consisting of over 550 items were used to collect the basic data. The response rate was 40% (956/2,401). This is part of a nation-wide study designed to assess the long-term effect of perinatal conditions on mothers of multiples. Its aim was to study the growth and development of multiples in childhood, and to conduct a genetic epidemiologic study to test the developmental origin of health and disease hypothesis. One of the ultimate aims of this research was to provide evidence-based information on parenting multiples from pregnancy through childhood to families with multiples.",

    "abstract": "This article profiles the historical twin databases of the secondary education school attached to the Faculty of Education at the University of Tokyo. The school was established in 1948. Every year, about 50 pairs of twins of all sex and zygosity combinations and aged 11-12 years take an examination, and about 10-20 pairs are admitted based on the results. Three data sets exist: one for applicants (11-12 years), one for junior and senior high school students (12-18 years), and one for graduates (18-79 years). Record linkage of these three databases should facilitate several important research projects; for example, the lifecourse genetic epidemiologic studies and verification of so-called developmental origin of health and disease hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Exercise-induced positive changes in skeletal muscle properties and metabolism decrease the risk for disability, cardiometabolic diseases and mortality. Here, we studied muscle properties and glucose homeostasis in a non-exercise stage in twin pairs with co-twins discordant for physical activity habits for at least 32 years of their adult lives. Isometric knee extension force, MR imaging of midthigh tissue composition and muscle volume, and fasting blood samples were acquired from 16 same-sex (seven monozygotic, nine dizygotic) middle-aged and older twin pairs. The consistently active twins had 20 % higher knee extension forces than their inactive co-twins (p = 0.006) although the active twins had only 4 % higher midthigh muscle cross-sectional areas (p = 0.072). These results were similar in intrapair analysis in which only the seven identical twin pairs were included. The ratio between the area of midthigh fat and muscle tissues was significantly lower among the active twins (0.65 vs. 0.48, p = 0.006). The active twins had also lower fasting plasma glucose levels (5.1 vs 5.6 mmol/l, p = 0.041). The area of midthigh intramuscular (extramyocellular) fat was associated with the markers of glucose homeostasis, especially with glycated hemoglobin, and these associations were emphasized by the diabetic and inactive twins. Regular exercise throughout the adult life retains muscle strength and quality but not necessarily mass. The regular use of muscles also prevents from the accumulation of intramuscular fat which might be related to maintained glucose metabolism and, thus, prevention of metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have identified phenotypic associations between Cloninger's temperament dimensions and the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults. However the underlying aetiology of these associations remains unclear. We investigate the extent to which genetic and environmental influences contribute to the relationship between temperament and ADHD, examining the ADHD symptoms of inattention (IA) and hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI) separately. Participants were 886 adult twin pairs aged 19-20 years. ADHD symptoms of IA and HI were measured using a DSM-IV based rating scale. Temperament was measured using Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), across four dimensions: novelty seeking (NS), harm avoidance (HA), reward dependence (RD) and persistence (PS). The twin method was used to decompose phenotypic variance/covariance among these variables into genetic and environmental components. We found that NS was genetically associated with both ADHD symptom dimensions (IA and HI), but that HA was genetically associated with IA only. There was also some evidence of genetic association between PS, IA and HI. These findings suggest that unique profiles of temperament are genetically related to the two ADHD symptom dimensions in adults. Further work is now needed to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie both the combined and separate symptom factor domains of ADHD.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies indicate an association between sleep problems and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Although both these conditions separately have moderate heritabilities, confounding by genetic factors has not previously been taken into account. This study aimed to reveal the association between sleep problems and GERD, while adjusting for heredity and other potential confounding factors.\nThis cross-sectional population-based study included all 8,014 same-sexed twins of at least 65 years of age and born in Sweden between 1886 and 1958, who participated in telephone interviews in 1998-2002. Three logistic regression models were used 1) external control analysis, 2) within-pair co-twin analysis with dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs discordant for GERD, and 3) within-pair co-twin analysis with monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for GERD. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and adjusted for established risk factors for GERD, i.e. sex, age, body mass index (BMI), tobacco smoking, and educational level.\nA dose-response association was identified between increasing levels of sleep problems and GERD in the external control analysis. Individuals who often experienced sleep problems had a two-fold increased occurrence of GERD compared to those who seldom had sleep problems (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.8-2.4). The corresponding association was of similar strength in the co-twin analysis including 356 DZ pairs (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.6-3.4), and in the co-twin analysis including 210 MZ pairs (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.9-2.7).\nA dose-dependent association between sleep problems and GERD remains after taking heredity and other known risk factors for GERD into account.",

    "abstract": "The Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) is a large longitudinal sample of twins born in England and Wales between 1994 and 1996. The focus of TEDS has been on cognitive and behavioral development, including difficulties in the context of normal development. TEDS began when multiple births were identified from birth records and the families were invited to take part in the study; 16,810 pairs of twins were originally enrolled in TEDS. More than 10,000 of these twin pairs remain enrolled in the study to date. DNA has been collected for more than 7,000 pairs, and genome-wide genotyping data for two million DNA markers are available for 3,500 individuals. The TEDS families have taken part in studies when the twins were aged 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, and 16 years of age. Data collection is currently underway to assess the adult destinations of the twins as they move from school to university and the workplace. Between January 2012 and December 2014, all of the TEDS twins will turn 18, and the study will transition to an adult sample. TEDS represents an outstanding resource for investigating the developmental effects of genes and environments on complex quantitative traits from childhood to young adulthood and beyond.",

Within a dual-mechanism account of inflectional morphology, these deficits reflect disruption to the rule-based process that adds (or strips) the suffix -ed to regular verb stems; but the fact that the patients are also impaired at detecting the difference between word pairs like \"tray\" and \"trade\" (the latter being a phonological but not a morphological twin to \"played\") suggests an important role for phonological characteristics of the regular past tense. The present study examined MEG brain responses in healthy participants evoked by spoken regular past-tense forms and phonological twin words (plus twin pseudowords and a non-speech control) presented in a passive oddball paradigm. Deviant forms (played, trade, kwade/kwayed) relative to their standards (play, tray, kway) elicited a pronounced neuromagnetic response at approximately 130 ms after the onset of the affix; this response was maximal at sensors over temporal areas of both hemispheres but stronger on the left, especially for played and kwayed. Relative to the same standards, a different set of deviants ending in /t/--plate, trait and kwate--produced stronger difference responses especially over the right hemisphere. Results are discussed with regard to dual- and single-mechanism theories of past tense processing and the need to consider neurobiological evidence in attempts to understand inflectional morphology.",

    "abstract": "Studies of schizophrenia inheritance in identical twins show a concordance of about 50%, which supports an epigenetic model. In our present study we investigated methylation of genomic DNA and promoter methylation of Reelin and SOX10 genes in peripheral blood of twins suffering from schizophrenia. Global DNA methylation was reduced (52.3%) in schizophrenic twins if compared with healthy control twins (65.7%). The reduced methylation was significant in males only. We also found a similar hypomethylation in the non-affected twins of discordant pairs and a mixed group of psychiatric controls. In discordant twins there was a relative hypermethylation of the SOX10 promoter. Within-pair-difference of methylation of Reelin promoter was significantly lower in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins.",

In this paper, we describe a case of rectal bleeding in monozygotic preterm twins that was resolved with the introduction of a cow's milk protein-free diet (CMPFD). The occurrence of this disorder in monozygotic twins raises the question as to whether the underlying abnormality in the immune regulation, which leads to poor acquisition of tolerance to cow's milk proteins, might be inherited or environmentally acquired. The case also highlights the use of the probiotic Lactobacillus GG (LGG) in the treatment of allergic colitis.",

    "abstract": "Does the intergenerational influence on birthweight and birth length remain within female dizygotic and monozygotic twin pairs?\nThe intergenerational influence on birthweight and birth length remained within dizygotic but not within monozygotic twin pairs.\nLow birthweight is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in both the short and long term; therefore it is important to understand determinants of fetal growth. There is a known intergenerational association between parents' and offspring's size at birth.\nThis is a register-based cohort study with a nested within-twin-pair comparison. The study is retrospective, but based on prospectively collected information. The study population included 8685 monozygotic and like-sexed dizygotic female twins born in Sweden from 1926 to 1985, who had given birth to their first infant between 1973 and 2009.\nThis study is set in Sweden and used data from the Swedish Twin Register and the Swedish Medical Birth Register. We used generalized estimating equations to obtain regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the outcomes: offspring birthweight and birth length. To control for genetic and shared environmental factors, we performed within-twin-pair analyses in 1479 dizygotic and 1526 monozygotic twin pairs.\nIn the cohort of both dizygotic and monozygotic twins, there was an association between mother's and offspring's size at birth. Within-dizygotic twin pairs, a 500-g increase from the twin pair's mean birthweight was associated with increased offspring birthweight [70 g (95% CI: 35-106)] and birth length [0.22 cm (95% CI: 0.07-0.38)]. The corresponding increase in birth length of 1 cm was estimated to increase offspring's birthweight by 26 g (95% CI: 12-40) and birth length by 0.11 cm (95% CI: 0.04-0.17). Within-monozygotic twin pairs there were no such associations.\nThis study is limited to twins who themselves or whose co-twin voluntarily responded to questionnaires.\nThe intergenerational influence on size at birth is suggested to be due to direct or indirect genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Human intelligence, as measured by intelligence quotient (IQ) tests, demonstrates one of the highest heritabilities among human quantitative traits. Nevertheless, studies to identify quantitative trait loci responsible for intelligence face challenges because of the small effect sizes of individual genes. Phenotypically discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins provide a feasible way to minimize the effects of irrelevant genetic and environmental factors, and should yield more interpretable results by finding epigenetic or gene expression differences between twins. Here we conducted array-based genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression analyses using 17 pairs of healthy MZ twins discordant intelligently. ARHGAP18, related to Rho GTPase, was identified in pair-wise methylation status analysis and validated via direct bisulfite sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR. To perform expression profile analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) between the groups of twins with higher IQ and their co-twins revealed up-regulated expression of several ribosome-related genes and DNA replication-related genes in the group with higher IQ. To focus more on individual pairs, we conducted pair-wise GSEA and leading edge analysis, which indicated up-regulated expression of several ion channel-related genes in twins with lower IQ. Our findings implied that these groups of genes may be related to IQ and should shed light on the mechanism underlying human intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Individual's hearing performance after cochlear implant (CI) is variable and depends on different factors such as etiology of deafness, age at implantation, and social/family hearing environment. Here we report the case of dizygotic twins, boy and girl, presenting with neurosensorial profound deafness prior CI (age of implantation = 3.5 years old). Both parents have severe/profound deafness, since childhood, and use sign language as primary mode of communication. Clinical and genetic characterization was performed, as well as the assessment of the auditory and oral (re)habilitation after CI, applying a battery of audiological, speech, and language tests. The twin girl and the father were homozygous for the c.35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene, while the twin boy and the mother were compound heterozygotes, both monoallelic for c.35delG and for the deletion del(GJB6-D13S1830) in the GJB6 gene. The remaining hearing impaired relatives were c.35delG homozygotes. The genetic cause of deafness was thus identified in this family. Some noteworthy differences were observed regarding twins' auditory and oral performance after CI. Subsequent follow-up of these children allowed us to conclude that those differences were most likely due to the different environment in which the twins have been living than to their different GJB2/GJB6 genotypes.",

    "abstract": "A mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) A3243G is an important cause of some serious mitochondrial diseases, and maternal inheritance of the mutation has been reported. In order to investigate the heredity of the mutation, we measured the ratio of the mutated mtDNA molecule among 32 families of identical twins. Both twins from one family showed 20.16% and 18.49% mutated molecules, and the level is significantly high in comparison with members of other families and control subjects (0.23-0.86%). Their parents, however, showed normal level of mutated molecules (0.70% and 0.66%). The high-level mutation of the twins may be due to a spontaneous event, which occurred during development of germ line of their mother, or oogenesis of their mother, or during early stage of their development.",

    "abstract": "Submicroscopic 6p25 deletion is now recognized as a clinically identifiable syndrome, characterized by intellectual disability, language impairment, hearing deficit, craniofacial, ophthalmologic, cardiac, and varying central nervous system anomalies. We report on two dyzogotic twins with a maternal segregating hemizygous interstitial deletion on chromosome 6p25.1, spanning 0.9\u00a0kb; the smallest ever reported. Both had dysmorphic features (prominence of the metopic suture, synophrys, hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, tented mouth), and a distinct brain MRI, showing a focal significant increase of the right peri-frontal subarachnoid space, with shallow sulci and a mild anomaly of the gyral pattern. Such brain anomaly has never been reported in association with del 6p25. Both propositi had a borderline-mild intellectual disability, speech and language difficulties, and behavior abnormalities. Their mother, formally tested, had a borderline cognitive impairment. Although none of the genes mapping to the deleted region are apparently related to the phenotype, LYRM4 resulted down-regulated in the cerebellar cortex of schizophrenia patients compared with controls, and Lyrm4 was down-regulated in the prefrontal cortex of mice with microdeletions in the locus syntenic to human 22q11.2 patients affected by schizophrenia. These data are in agreement with the emerging concept that similar CNVs are pathogenic in patients affected by distinct neurological diseases, and that these loci are more general risk factors for different disorders. The resemblance of our patients to those with the more extensive 6p25.1p25.3 terminal deletion suggests that the gene/s responsible for the physical phenotype should reside in the 6p25.1 genomic region.",

    "abstract": "Variation in the composition of the human oral microbiome in health and disease has been observed. We have characterized inter- and intra-individual variation of microbial communities of 107 individuals in one of the largest cohorts to date (264 saliva samples), using culture-independent 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. We examined the salivary microbiome in up to three time-points during 10 yr spanning adolescence, and determined the influence of human genotype, gender, age, and weight class. Participants, including 27 monozygotic and 18 dizygotic twin pairs, were sampled mainly at ages 12-13, 17-18, and 22-24, with a few sampled as early as 8 yr of age. In contrast to gut or skin microbiomes, there is a core genus-level salivary microbiome. Individuals are more similar to themselves and their co-twins in the 12-17 and in the 17-22 cohorts than to the whole sample population, but not over the 10 yr from 12 to 22; and monozygotic twin pairs are statistically not more similar than dizygotic twin pairs. The data are most consistent with shared environment serving as the main determinant of microbial populations. Twins resemble each other more closely than the whole population at all time-points, but become less similar to each other when they age and no longer cohabit. Several organisms have age-specific abundance profiles, including members of the genera Veillonella, Actinomyces, and Streptococcus. There is no clear effect of weight class and gender. The results of this work will provide a basis to further study oral microbes and human health.",

From seven metaphase-II oocytes thawed, five survived, four were fertilized after ICSI and two cleaving embryos were transferred on day 3. A diamniotic dichorionic term pregnancy was achieved, ending with the delivery of two healthy girls.

    "abstract": "Chest circumference (CC) is suggested to be a good indicator of early life nutrition, but little is known on the heritability of CC. Thus we analysed the effects of genetic and environmental factors on the development of CC in Japanese infants.\nCC was measured longitudinally from birth until 1 year of age in a cohort of 211 monozygotic and 160 dizygotic complete Japanese twin pairs born in 1989-2002. The data were analysed using applications of structural linear equation modelling for twin data.\nNo sex-specific differences in the variance components were found. Environmental factors unique to each twin explained the major part of the variation of CC at birth whereas environmental factors shared by co-twins were more important at 1-3 months of age. From 3 months of age, the effect of genetic factors become steadily stronger and they explained the majority of the variation at 1 year of age. Strong genetic continuity in the development of CC was found, but also new sets of genes were activated during the first year of life. The origin of the environmental part of the variation could be tracked before 3 months of age. A substantial part of common and specific environmental factors affecting CC affected also birthweight.\nCC is sensitive to intrauterine environmental factors, but these effects diminish during the first year of life, at least if postnatal environment is good. CC can be a useful indicator when identifying newborns who have suffered suboptimal pre-natal conditions.",

    "abstract": "Although discordant phenotypes in monozygotic twins with developmental disorder are not an exception, underlying genetic discordance is rarely reported. Here, we report on the clinical and cytogenetic details of 4-year-old female monozygotic twins with discordant phenotypes. Twin 1 exhibited global developmental delay, overweight and hyperactivity. Twin 2 had an autistic spectrum disorder. Molecular karyotyping in twin 1 identified a 2p25.3 deletion, further confirmed by Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on leukocytes. Interestingly, array comparative genomic hybridization was normal in twin 2 but FISH analysis using the same probe as twin 1 showed mosaicism with one-third of cells with a 2p25.3 deletion, one-third of cells with a 2p25.3 duplication, and one-third of normal cells. Genotyping with microsatellite markers confirmed the monozygosity of the twins. We propose that the chromosome imbalance may be due to a mitotic non-allelic recombination occurring during blastomeric divisions of a normal zygote. Such event will result in three distinct cell populations, whose proportion in each embryo formed after separation from the zygote may differ, leading to discordant chromosomal anomalies between twins. We also discuss that the MYTL1L and the SNTG2 genes within the reported region could probably relate to the phenotypic discordance of the monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Total muscle triglyceride (MT) content has been associated with insulin resistance. We investigated the predictors and impact of MT on relevant metabolic parameters including peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance in elderly twins.\nSeventy-four elderly same-sex twins underwent hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps preceded by an iv glucose tolerance test. Aerobic capacity (VO2max) and body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan) were determined in all twins. A biopsy from the vastus lateralis muscle was excised in the fasting state. The muscle triacylglycerol content was analyzed by biochemical extraction from these biopsies.\nThe percentage of total body fat was the only independent predictor of MT content. After adjustment for trunk fat percentages and sex, MT level was significantly associated to fasting plasma levels of glucose and insulin as well as hepatic insulin resistance. However, the association was weakened after adjustment for total fat percentages. A 1 SD (34.5 mmol/kg dry weight) increase in MT content was associated with a 24% increase of hepatic insulin resistance. No association between MT content and peripheral insulin sensitivity was observed.\nMT content is associated with hepatic but not peripheral insulin resistance in elderly twins. We speculate that MT content may reflect the general ectopic accumulation of triglycerides, including fat in the liver.",

Five-fold twinned structure has been found in the final configuration of the nanoparticle. Furthermore, detailed formation process has been visualized and carefully discussed. During the formation of five-fold twinned structure, two main stages have been identified, including i) liquid-solid phase transition at solidification point, in which the main part of the five-fold twinned structure formed, and ii) structural relaxation, in which twinning boundaries and five-fold axis were transformed to eliminate the dislocation between two adjacent five-fold twins.",

    "abstract": "Using scanning electron microscopy, microscopic structures have been identified in fresh cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but only rarely in control subjects. However, it has not been determined whether these microscopic particles represent state or trait markers, i.e. if their presence is related to clinical manifestations of the disease or if they also can be found in as yet asymptomatic individuals with a genetic liability. This question can be addressed by studying twins discordant or concordant for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.\nWe investigated microscopic structures in CSF in 102 individuals: 21 monozygotic and 16 dizygotic twins affected or not affected with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder and in 65 healthy singleton controls. A first and a second fraction of CSF was freshly applied on filters and examined by scanning electron microscopy technique. Spherical particles with lipid appearance averaging between 0.1 to 8.0 \u00b5m in diameter were detected in the center of the filter as well as located in the margins of larger aggregates binding in a viscous state. Structures were found in 12 of 17 probands, 5 of 12 healthy co-twins and 3 of 73 healthy controls. Thus, a positive microscopic finding significantly increased the likelihood of belonging to the proband group (OR=48, 95% CL: 8.2-550, p<0.0001) and the co-twin-group (OR=16, 95% CL: 2.0-218, p=0.006). Age, sex, history of alcohol abuse or anxiety syndrome, somatic disorder and markers of acute inflammatory activity did not account for group differences; nor did exposure to psychotropic medication.\nPresence of microscopic particles in CSF may possibly reflect trait dependent genetic or environmental vulnerability in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder.",

In regression analysis, affected co-twins were significantly more likely to have had an abnormal cerebral ultrasound than their unaffected co-twins in pairs discordant for cerebral palsy (odds ratio (OR): 13.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.22 to 76.03)) and in pairs discordant for neurodevelopmental impairment (OR: 4.00, 95% CI: 1.13 to 14.18). Outcomes and discordance in outcomes were similar for monochorionic and dichorionic pairs.\nDespite shared genetics and risk factors, twins may have discordant outcomes.

    "abstract": "This update on the Southern Illinois Twins and Siblings Study (SITSS) documents some of the follow-up studies that have been conducted and results that have been obtained from this sample. At the current time, 283 twin pairs, 8 triplet families, 98 non-twin sibling pairs, and 287 singletons have been enrolled in SITSS. Twins and triplets are tested as young as 1 year of age and then every year on their birthday through age 5 years. A variety of follow-up studies have been conducted for SITSS children through age 20. Results thus far have demonstrated significant genetic influences on social behaviors such as aggression, victimization, and attention toward facial expressions. Interesting interactions have been documented between the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) and the social environment (parental sensitivity or peer aggression) as they predict children's aggressive behaviors. In addition, increased difficulty with social interactions has been noted for twins versus singletons. Thus, this multi-trait, multi-method behavior genetic data set contributes to our understanding of the etiology of social behaviors in preschoolers and to predictors of similar behaviors through adolescence.",

    "abstract": "The Bielefeld Longitudinal Study of Adult Twins (BiLSAT) is a German longitudinal study of monozygotic and dizygotic twins reared together, including more than 1,100 twin pairs aged between 14 and 80 who participated in the first wave. Data were collected at five waves of assessment between 1993 and 2009. Initially, the study focused on genetic and environmental influences on the structure and the development in adult temperament and personality. Today, the study includes a broad range of individual variables, such as personality disorders, major life goals, interests, attitudes, values, life and work satisfaction, and major life events. A special feature of this genetically informative study lies in the multiple-rater approach (i.e., self-reports and peer reports). Longitudinal multiple-rater analyses allow researchers to go beyond the basic nature-nurture decomposition of variance in self-reports examining genetic and environmental influences on stability and change in more accurately measured individual attributes. In the current article, we briefly describe the design and contents of BiLSAT as well as some recent major findings and future plans.",

    "abstract": "To present prenatal diagnosis and molecular cytogenetic characterization of trisomy 18 in a monozygotic twin pregnancy, with one structurally abnormal living fetus and one intrauterine fetal demise.\nA 38-year-old woman was referred for amniocentesis at 16 weeks of gestation because of advanced maternal age. Prenatal ultrasound revealed a monozygotic twin pregnancy, with one structurally abnormal living fetus, and one fetal demise. The body structure details of the dead fetus could not be identified, whereas holoprosencephaly and omphalocele were identified in the living fetus on prenatal ultrasound. Quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction assays using polymorphic DNA markers specific for chromosome 21 and chromosome 18, were applied to the uncultured amniocytes in the amniotic cavity of the living fetus and the cultured amniocytes in the amniotic cavity of the fetus with intrauterine fetal demise. The specimen showed a dosage ratio of 2:1 (paternal:maternal) for chromosome 18-specific markers in both twins. The result was consistent with monozygosity and trisomy 18, and the trisomy 18 was possibly caused by a paternal second meiotic division non-disjunction error or a postzygotic mitotic error. Conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed a karyotype of 47,XY,+18 in both twins. The pregnancy was terminated at 19 weeks of gestation, and a 2g small-for-date macerated twin A and a 166g malformed twin B were delivered. Twin A manifested cebocephaly and omphalocele, and twin B manifested premaxillary agenesis and omphalocele.\nThe present case provides evidence that fetal wastage may occur in one of the co-twins in monozygotic twins associated with trisomy 18, and this may in part explain the very rare occurrence of living monozygotic twins with trisomy 18.",

    "abstract": "Dermatoglyphs are polygenetically determined epidermal ridge configurations on the fingers, palms and soles. An analysis of the digito-palmar dermatoglyphics obtained from 69 pairs of same-sex twins (32 monozygotic and 37 dizygotic) was performed in the population of Kosovo. Qualitative traits on the fingers (whorls, arches, radial and ulnar loops) and palms (pattern frequencies in the thenar/I, II, III and IV interdigital areas and hypothenar, the frequencies of positions of axial triradius) of both hands were analysed. The homolateral and heterolateral concordance of dermatoglyphic patterns between twin pairs were calculated for the monozygotic and dizygotic twins separately. The estimates of heritability for qualitative dermatoglyphic traits and the impacts of twin's shared (c(2)) and non-shared (individual) environments (e(2)) were presented. According to our results, the heritability patterns sharply distinguish highly heritable dermatoglyphic traits (patterns on the thenar and I interdigital area, II interdigital area and all the digits) and the traits with weak genetic component (patterns on the III and IV interdigital area, the hypothenar and the axial triradius position). In addition, the concordance and the heritability estimates in twins correspond to the embryonic growth of fingers (from the first to the fifth finger) and palm patterns (the II interdigital area). Based on findings presented here, we expect that the noxious environmental factors (possibly causing diseases later in life) would leave traces on the dermatoglyphs, which could be recognized as the increased dissimilarity of the twins (and other relatives) in the III and IV interdigital area, hypothenar, and in axial triradius position.",

    "abstract": "In general, heterosexual men are less favorable to asking for help compared to women and gay men. This can be problematic if a man avoids professional help when he is experiencing significant psychological distress. Yet, it is unclear to what degree such attitudes among men are due to innate differences or social environments. Studying twins provides one avenue for teasing apart these relationships.\nWe recruited 38 pairs of monozygotic male twins (Mage = 35.87 years, SD = 9.52) raised together and who were discordant for sexual orientation. They completed measures of psychological distress (Symptom Checklist-90-Revised), positive attitudes toward psychological help-seeking behavior, and emphasis with fulfilling traditional masculine norms.\nContrary to predictions, the heterosexual twins expressed more symptoms of specific distress-hostility (r = .30), paranoid ideation (r = .26), and psychoticism (r = .24)-than their gay cotwins. As predicted, heterosexual men were less favorable to seeking help (r = .25) and expressed greater emphasis on masculine norms (r = .26) than their cotwins. Within each group of men, unique aspects of masculine norms were significantly related to attitudes toward psychological help-seeking behavior.\nThe findings lend credence to the hypothesis that social environments influence attitudes and behaviors that are stereotypically masculine and potentially detrimental to men's health.",

    "abstract": "Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is the 4th most common malignancy in men and the 8th most common cause of male cancer death in the United States. Conversely, upper tract urothelial carcinoma accounts for only 5% to 10% of all urothelial carcinoma. Due to the relative preponderance of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, much of the clinical decision making regarding upper tract urothelial carcinoma is extrapolated from evidence that is based on urothelial carcinoma of the bladder cohorts. In fact, only 1 major urological organization has treatment guidelines specific for upper tract urothelial carcinoma. While significant similarities exist between these 2 diseases, ignoring the important differences may be preventing us from optimizing therapy in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Therefore, we explored these dissimilarities, including the differential importance of gender, anatomy, staging, intracavitary therapy, surgical lymphadenectomy and perioperative systemic chemotherapy on the behavior of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and upper tract urothelial carcinoma.\nA nonsystematic literature search using the MEDLINE/PubMed\u00ae database was conducted to identify original articles, review articles and editorials. Searches were limited to the English language and studies in humans and in adults, and used the key words urothelial carcinoma, upper tract urothelial carcinoma or transitional cell carcinoma combined with several different sets of key words to identify appropriate publications for each section of the manuscript. The key words, broken down by section, were 1) epidemiology, sex, gender; 2) location, tumor location; 3) staging, stage; 4) intracavitary, intravesical, topical therapy; 5) lymphadenectomy, lymph node, lymph node dissection and 6) adjuvant, neoadjuvant, chemotherapy.\nWomen who present with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder do so with less favorable tumor characteristics and have worse survival than men. However, gender does not appear to be associated with survival outcomes in upper tract urothelial carcinoma. The prognostic effect that urothelial carcinoma tumor location has on outcomes prediction is a matter of debate, and the influence of tumor location may reflect our technical ability to accurately stage and treat the disease more than the actual tumor biology. Moreover, technical limitations of upper tract urothelial carcinoma sampling compared to transurethral resection for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder are the most important source of staging differences between the 2 diseases. Intravesical chemotherapy and immunotherapy are essential components of standard of care for most nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, while adjuvant intracavitary therapy for patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma treated endoscopically or percutaneously has been sparsely used and without any clear guidelines. The widespread adoption of the use of intracavitary therapy in the upper tract will likely not only require additional data to support its efficacy, but will also require a less cumbersome means of administration. Lymphadenectomy at the time of radical cystectomy is widely accepted while lymphadenectomy at the time of radical nephroureterectomy is performed largely at the discretion of the surgeon. Among other reasons, this may be due in part to the variable lymphatic drainage along the course of the ureter compared to the relatively confined lymphatic landing sites for the bladder. Level I evidence has demonstrated a clear survival benefit for systemic chemotherapy before radical surgery or radiation in patients with clinical T2-4N0M0 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Such data are not available in the population with upper tract urothelial carcinoma. However, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be even more important in upper tract urothelial carcinoma than in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder because of the obligatory kidney function loss that occurs at radical nephroureterectomy.\nWhile urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and upper tract urothelial carcinoma share many characteristics, they represent 2 distinct diseases. There are practical, anatomical, biological and molecular differences that warrant consideration when risk stratifying and treating patients with these disparate twin diseases. To overcome the challenges that impede progress toward evidence-based medicine in upper tract urothelial carcinoma, we believe that focused collaborative efforts will best augment our understanding of this rare disease and ultimately improve the care we deliver to our patients.",

However, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be even more important in upper tract urothelial carcinoma than in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder because of the obligatory kidney function loss that occurs at radical nephroureterectomy.",

    "abstract": "With the desire to assess genetic variation across the lifespan in large-scale collaborative projects, one question is whether inference of copy number (CN) is sensitive to the source of material for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis (e.g., blood and buccal) and another question is whether CN is stable as individual sage. Here, we address these questions by applying Affymetrix 6.0 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)micro-arrays to 1,472 DNA samples from 710 individuals from the Netherlands Twin Register, including twin and non-twin individuals (372 with buccal and blood derived DNA and 388 with longitudinal data).Similar concordance for CN and genotype inference between samples from the same individual [or from the monozygotic (MZ) co-twins] was found for blood and buccal tissues. There was a small but statistically significant decrease in across-tissue concordance compared with concordance of samples from the same tissue type. No temporal effect was seen on CN variation from the 388 individuals sampled at two time points ranging from 1 to 12 years apart. The majority of our individuals were sampled at age younger than 20 years. Genotype concordance was very high (~ > 99%) between co-twins from 43 MZ pairs. For75 dizygotic (DZ) pairs, ~was ~65%. CN estimates were highly consistent between co-twins from MZ pairs for both deletions (f?2 ~ 90%) and duplications (~ ~ 86%). For DZ, these were similar for within-individual comparisons, but naturally lower between co-twins (~ ~ 50-60%). These results suggest that DNA from buccal samples perform as well as DNA from blood samples on the current generation of micro-array technologies.",

    "abstract": "The dramatic increase in multiple births is an important public health issue, since such births have elevated risks for adverse perinatal outcomes. Our objective was to explore the most recent temporal trends in rates of multiple births in Canada and the United States.\nLive birth data from Canada (excluding Ontario) and the United States from 1991-2009 were used to calculate rates of twins, and triplet and higher-order multiples (triplet+). Temporal trends were assessed using tests for linear trend and absolute and relative changes in rates.\nTwin live births in the United States increased from 23.1 in 1991 to 32.2 per 1,000 live births in 2004, remained stable between 2004 and 2007, and then increased slightly to an all-time high of 33.2 per 1,000 live births in 2009. In Canada, rates also increased from 20.0 in 1991 to 28.3 per 1,000 live births in 2004, continued to increase modestly between 2004 and 2007, and rose to a high of 31.4 per 1,000 in 2009. Rates of triplet+ live births in the United States increased dramatically from 81.4 in 1991 to 193.5 per 100,000 live births in 1998, remained stable between 1998 and 2003 and then decreased to 148.9 per 100,000 in 2007. The rate declined marginally in 2008, but then rose again in 2009 to 153.5 per 100,000. Rates of triplet+ live births were much lower in Canada, although the temporal pattern of change was similar.\nThe rate of twin live births in the United States and Canada continues to increase, though more modestly than during the 1990s. Recent declines in rates of triplet+ live births in both countries have been followed by unstable trends.",

    "abstract": "Scientific literature is limited on problems related to the psychotherapy of twins, especially eating disorders. This paper discusses the therapeutic difficulties encountered with two anorexic and one bulimic sets of twins.\nThe three case reports show that the symbiotic tendency of twins is a frequent phenomenon, which may be a special resistance against change, and can serve as a factor maintaining the pathological state. In many cases, the parental behaviour strengthens the symbiosis of the twins, instead of helping the individuation.\nThe integration of individual and family therapeutic interventions is proposed. The separation-individuation process of the twins can be stimulated by individual sessions with each of the twins, or separate sessions during family therapy (i.e., sessions with the parents and with one of the twins). In this case, the best strategy would be to have the individual and family therapies conducted by the same therapist.",

Lesser difference was observed in the self-reported smoke exposure rate in monozygotic compared to dizygotic pairs concerning restaurants and caf\u00e9s (p<0.05) which was not present regarding bars, pubs and transportation facilities.",

    "abstract": "We describe how the use of multiple drugs and excessive alcohol intake caused a dilated cardiomyopathy complicated by cardiogenic shock and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in an otherwise healthy young man. The diagnosis was made by exclusion of other causes of cardiomyopathy. Surprisingly an ischaemic scar without significant coronary artery disease was also found on cardiac MRI, most likely related to vasoactive drugs (cocaine). An ICD was implanted during the same hospital stay after careful assessment of the risk of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the association of mild symptoms and mental well-being with risk of disability pension (DP) due to somatic diagnoses, even less for DP due to low back diagnoses (LBD). Moderate genetic influences on personality traits, life dissatisfaction and DP exist suggesting that shared genetic influences may underlie these associations. One can control for familial confounding (genetics and family environment) by examining twins. This twin study aimed to investigate personality traits and life dissatisfaction as predictors for DP due to LBD accounting for familial confounding.\nData on 24043 twins aged 18-65year in a baseline survey in 1975 was followed up from national DP register data until 2004. Personality traits were assessed using the short version of the Eysenck Personality Inventory and life dissatisfaction was measured with a four item scale on levels of interest, happiness, easiness, and loneliness of life. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nDP due to LBD was granted to 537 individuals during the follow-up. Each one unit increase in life dissatisfaction (HR 1.06; 95%CI 1.03, 1.10) and neuroticism (1.07; 1.03, 1.10) but not extroversion was significantly associated with an elevated risk for DP due to LBD. These associations with life dissatisfaction and neuroticism remained when socioeconomic status, education, and marital status were taken into account, and demonstrated an independence from familial confounding.\nLife dissatisfaction and neuroticism seems to be early, perhaps causal risk factors for DP due to LBD.",

    "abstract": "We explored genetic influences on the perception of taste and smell stimuli. Adult twins rated the chemosensory aspects of water, sucrose, sodium chloride, citric acid, ethanol, quinine hydrochloride, phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), potassium chloride, calcium chloride, cinnamon, androstenone, Galaxolide\u2122, cilantro, and basil. For most traits, individual differences were stable over time and some traits were heritable (h(2) from 0.41 to 0.71). Subjects were genotyped for 44 single nucleotide polymorphisms within and near genes related to taste and smell. The results of these association analyses confirmed previous genotype-phenotype results for PTC, quinine, and androstenone. New associations were detected for ratings of basil and a bitter taste receptor gene, TAS2R60, and between cilantro and variants in three genes (TRPA1, GNAT3, and TAS2R50). The flavor of ethanol was related to variation within an olfactory receptor gene (OR7D4) and a gene encoding a subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (SCNN1D). Our study demonstrates that person-to-person differences in the taste and smell perception of simple foods and drinks are partially accounted for by genetic variation within chemosensory pathways.",

The protein encoded by ARHGAP4 is thought to function as a Rho GTPase activating protein. Characterization of the genetic defect causing X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) and intellectual disability in two dizygotic twin brothers revealed a novel contiguous deletion of 17,905\u2009bp encompassing the entire AVPR2 gene and extending into intron 7 of the ARHGAP4 gene. Examination of their mother showed that she was a carrier of this deletion.

    "abstract": "Low birthweight (BW) is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. We compared glucose metabolism in adult BW-discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins, thereby controlling for genetic factors and rearing environment.\nAmong 77,885 twins in the Danish Twin Registry, 155 of the most BW-discordant MZ twin pairs (median BW difference 0.5\u00a0kg) were assessed using a 2\u00a0h oral glucose tolerance test with sampling of plasma (p-)glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1. HOMA for beta cell function (HOMA-\u03b2) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and also insulin sensitivity index (BIGTT-SI) and acute insulin response (BIGTT-AIR), were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed in those with: (1) double verification of BW difference; (2) difference in BW >0.5\u00a0kg; and (3) no overt metabolic disease (type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or thyroid disease).\nNo intra-pair differences in p-glucose, insulin, C-peptide, incretin hormones, HOMA-\u03b2, HOMA-IR or BIGTT-SI were identified. p-Glucose at 120\u00a0min was higher in the twins with the highest BW without metabolic disease, and BIGTT-AIR was higher in those with the highest BW although not in pairs with a BW difference of >0.5\u00a0kg.\nBW-discordant MZ twins provide no evidence for a detrimental effect of low BW on glucose metabolism in adulthood once genetic factors and rearing environment are controlled for.",

    "abstract": "Systematic structural characterization using high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and diffractogram analysis of silver nanorice was aimed to reveal the characteristic features of twins and stacking faults, faceting effect and smoothing phenomena of outer surfaces. Nucleation, growth and crystallization of new nanocrystals, and depletion of parent nanorice was observed by the in situ TEM through electron-beam irradiation. It can be seen that the fundamental growth mechanism of the new nucleus is Ag atom diffusion or migration through carbon film supported these crystals. Twins in the as-grown nanorice is a reflection twin with {111} lattice plane as the common plane, and they are formed by 120\u00b0 or 60\u00b0 rotation about the reference twin lamella. Shockley partial dislocation was formed by the {111} lattice plane shifting along the <112> direction with the Burgers vector a/6 <112>. Twin faults occur in the form of adjacent twin lamellas inserted into a single atomic plane. Growth morphology analysis suggests that {111} and {001} lattice planes with the minimum surface attachment energy have a tendency to facet.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the link between sibling relationships and children's social adjustment by comparing twin siblings and siblings with different ages (singleton siblings}, and clarified the role of reciprocity in sibling relationships on children's social development. Mothers of 58 monozygotic twin pairs, 48 dizygotic twin pairs, and 86 singleton sibling pairs reported their children's sibling relationships and social adjustment.This study showed that the effects of sibling relationships on the prosocial behaviors and conduct problems of each child are stronger for twins than for singleton siblings. Moreover, positivity toward one's sibling increased peer problems only among monozygotic twins. The opposite tendency was present among dizygotic twins and singleton siblings. This study suggests the importance for children's social development of having many interactions with siblings and establishing reciprocity in sibling relationships. Moreover, our results suggest that the quality of sibling relationships among monozygotic twins may be different from those among dizygotic twins and singleton siblings.",

    "abstract": "To determine if the large and highly reproducible interindividual differences in rates of performance deficit accumulation during sleep deprivation, as determined by the number of lapses on a sustained reaction time test, the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), arise from a heritable trait.\nProspective, observational cohort study.\nAcademic medical center.\nThere were 59 monozygotic (mean age 29.2 \u00b1 6.8 [SD] yr; 15 male and 44 female pairs) and 41 dizygotic (mean age 26.6 \u00b1 7.6 yr; 15 male and 26 female pairs) same-sex twin pairs with a normal polysomnogram.\nThirty-eight hr of monitored, continuous sleep deprivation.\nPatients performed the 10-min PVT every 2 hr during the sleep deprivation protocol. The primary outcome was change from baseline in square root transformed total lapses (response time \u2265 500 ms) per trial. Patient-specific linear rates of performance deficit accumulation were separated from circadian effects using multiple linear regression. Using the classic approach to assess heritability, the intraclass correlation coefficients for accumulating deficits resulted in a broad sense heritability (h(2)) estimate of 0.834. The mean within-pair and among-pair heritability estimates determined by analysis of variance-based methods was 0.715. When variance components of mixed-effect multilevel models were estimated by maximum likelihood estimation and used to determine the proportions of phenotypic variance explained by genetic and nongenetic factors, 51.1% (standard error = 8.4%, P < 0.0001) of twin variance was attributed to combined additive and dominance genetic effects.\nGenetic factors explain a large fraction of interindividual variance among rates of performance deficit accumulations on PVT during sleep deprivation.",

    "abstract": "Appearance, aging, and disorders of the breast are multifactorial. There are intrinsic, patient-specific characteristics, such as breast growth during puberty and propensity for breast cancer, which are primarily inherited. There are also environmental factors, which can be potentially controlled. Monozygotic twins provide an excellent research opportunity to examine the role of extrinsic factors in subjects with identical genetic predispositions.\nThe authors investigate the role and significance of various environmental and acquired factors on breast aesthetics.\nIdentical female twins were recruited during the Twins Days Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, in 2009 and 2010. After consent was obtained, enrolled subjects completed a comprehensive survey on their medical and personal history. Standardized digital photographs were taken by medical photographers. Sixteen aesthetic breast features were subjectively rated by 6 plastic surgery residents blinded to the survey results. These ratings were then analyzed against survey data to determine the significance of different exogenous factors on breast appearance.\nA total of 161 pairs of identical female twins (n = 322) with a mean (SD) age of 47.6 (14.5) years were recruited. Twins who moisturized their skin daily had significantly fewer rhytids (P = .002). Twins who received hormone replacement therapy after menopause had more attractive breast shape, size, projection, areolar shape, and areolar size (P < .03). However, twins who had a higher body mass index, greater number of pregnancies, and larger cup sizes had significantly less attractive breasts (P < .05). Twins who smoked cigarettes and consumed alcohol also had significantly less attractive breasts (P < .05). Twins who breastfed had less attractive areolar size and shape but better skin quality than their counterparts who never breastfed (P < .03). Finally, there was a significantly higher incidence of breast pain in twins who primarily slept on their sides compared with twins who primarily slept on their backs (P < .008).\nThis study implicates several environmental factors that significantly affect the aesthetic quality of breasts.",

    "abstract": "Sequence-based variation in gene expression is a key driver of disease risk. Common variants regulating expression in cis have been mapped in many expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, typically in single tissues from unrelated individuals. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of gene expression across multiple tissues conducted in a large set of mono- and dizygotic twins that allows systematic dissection of genetic (cis and trans) and non-genetic effects on gene expression. Using identity-by-descent estimates, we show that at least 40% of the total heritable cis effect on expression cannot be accounted for by common cis variants, a finding that reveals the contribution of low-frequency and rare regulatory variants with respect to both transcriptional regulation and complex trait susceptibility. We show that a substantial proportion of gene expression heritability is trans to the structural gene, and we identify several replicating trans variants that act predominantly in a tissue-restricted manner and may regulate the transcription of many genes.",

    "abstract": "Dichorionic diamniotic twins were born at 37 weeks of gestation by cesarean section to a 34-year-old primigravid Japanese woman because the first twin was in breech presentation. The mother had been diagnosed with pemphigus vulgaris prior to her pregnancy. In addition to a high antidesmoglein 3 autoantibody titer, flaccid bullae and erosions on both of the twins' lips and in their oral cavities at 13 days of age led to the diagnosis of neonatal pemphigus vulgaris. This case highlights the need for awareness that pemphigus vulgaris may not occur immediately after birth.",

    "abstract": "Since 2006, the advent of increasingly larger genome-wide association studies and their meta-analyses have led to numerous, replicated findings of genetic polymorphisms associated with many diseases and traits. Early studies suggested that the identified loci generally accounted for a small fraction of the genetic variance estimated from twin and family studies. This led to the concept of 'missing heritability'. Here, the progress in accounting for a greater proportion of the variance is reviewed. In particular, gene-environment interactions can, for some traits and in certain circumstances, explain part of this missing heritability.",

    "abstract": "Hyperthyroidism is associated with severe comorbidity, such as stroke, and seems to confer increased mortality. However, it is unknown whether this increased mortality is explained by hyperthyroidism per se, comorbidity, and/or genetic confounding.\nThe objective of the study was to investigate whether hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased mortality and, if so, whether the association is influenced by comorbidity and/or genetic confounding.\nThis was an observational cohort study using record-linkage data from nationwide Danish health registers. We identified 4850 singletons and 926 twins from same-sex pairs diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Each case was matched with four controls for age and gender. The Charlson score was calculated from discharge diagnoses on an individual level to measure comorbidity. Cases and controls were followed up for a mean of 10 yr (range 0-31 yr), and the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was calculated using Cox regression analyses.\nIn singletons there was a significantly higher mortality in individuals diagnosed with hyperthyroidism than in controls [HR 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-1.46]. This persisted after adjustment for preexisting comorbidity (HR 1,28; 95% CI 1.21-1.36). In twin pairs discordant for hyperthyroidism (625 pairs), the twin with hyperthyroidism had an increased mortality compared with the corresponding cotwin (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.09-1.88). However, this was found only in dizygotic pairs (HR 1.80; 95% CI 1.27-2.55) but not in monozygotic pairs (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.60-1.50).\nHyperthyroidism is associated with an increased mortality independent of preexisting comorbidity. The study of twin pairs discordant for hyperthyroidism suggests that genetic confounding influences the association between hyperthyroidism and mortality.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this case study was to describe pain responses in three study conditions: longer (30 minutes) kangaroo care (KC) before and throughout heel stick (KC30), shorter (15 minutes) KC before and throughout heel stick (KC15), and incubator care throughout heel stick (IC) in 28-week gestational age twins. Pain responses were measured by crying time, Preterm Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), and heart rate variability indexes, including low-frequency power (LF, representing sympathetic activity), high-frequency power (HF, parasympathetic activity), and LF/HF ratio (sympathetic-parasympathetic balance). Both twins cried more and had higher PIPP pain scores and tachycardia during heel stick in the IC condition. Infant B had an incident of apnea and tachycardia by the end of the heel stick and a bradycardia episode during recovery in the IC condition. The twins had lower LF/HF ratios (better autonomic nervous system balance) during recovery in both longer and shorter KC conditions compared with the IC condition. Infant B had difficulty returning to LF/HF ratio baseline level after the painful procedure in the IC condition. These data suggest that both longer and shorter KC before and throughout painful procedures can be helpful in reducing behavioral and physiologic pain responses in preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "Cobedding of preterm twin infants provides tactile, olfactory, and auditory stimulation and may affect pain reactivity. We carried out a randomized trial to assess the effect of cobedding on pain reactivity and recovery in preterm twin neonates.\nStable preterm twins (n = 67 sets) between 28 and 36 weeks of gestational age were randomly assigned to a cobedding group (cared for in the same incubator or crib) or a standard care group (cared for in separate incubators or cribs). Pain response (determined by the Premature Infant Pain Profile [PIPP]) and time to return to physiologic baseline parameters were compared between groups with adjustment for the nonindependence of twin infants.\nMaternal and infant characteristics were not significantly different between twin infants in the cobedding and standard care groups except for 5-minute Apgar <7 and postnatal age and corrected gestational age on the day of the heel lance. Mean PIPP scores were not different between groups at 30, 60, or 120 seconds. At 90 seconds, mean PIPP scores were higher in the cobedding group (6.0 vs 5.0, P = .04). Recovery time was shorter in the cobedding group compared with the standard care group, (mean = 75.6 seconds versus 142.1 seconds, P = .001). No significant adverse events were associated with cobedding. Adjustment for nonindependence between twins and differences in baseline characteristics did not change the results.\nCobedding enhanced the physiologic recovery of preterm twins undergoing heel lance, but did not lead to lower pain scores.",

    "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently persists into adulthood. Family and twin studies delineate a disorder with strong genetic influences among children and adolescents based on parent- and teacher-reported data but little is known about the genetic and environmental contribution to DSM-IV ADHD symptoms in adulthood. We therefore aimed to investigate the impact of genetic and environmental influences on the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms of ADHD in adults.\nTwin methods were applied to self-reported assessments of ADHD symptoms from a large population-based Swedish twin study that included data from 15 198 Swedish male and female twins aged 20 to 46 years.\nThe broad heritability [i.e., A + D, where A is an additive genetic factor and D (dominance) a non-additive genetic factor] was 37% (A = 11%, D = 26%) for inattention and 38% (A = 18%, D = 20%) for hyperactivity-impulsivity. The results also indicate that 52% of the phenotypic correlation between inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity (r = 0.43) was explained by genetic influences whereas the remaining part of the covariance was explained by non-shared environmental influences. These results were replicated across age strata.\nOur findings of moderate broad heritability estimates are consistent with previous literature on self-rated ADHD symptoms in older children, adolescents and adults and retrospective reports of self-rated childhood ADHD by adults but differ from studies of younger children with informant ratings. Future research needs to clarify whether our data indicate a true decrease in the heritability of ADHD in adults compared to children, or whether this relates to the use of self-ratings in contrast to informant data.",

    "abstract": "The study evaluated the applicability of Doppler ultrasonography in predicting the course of pregnancy and neonatal outcome in dichorionic pregnancy complicated by growth discordance.\nDoppler examination of the umbilical artery (UA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) was performed in 106 twins. Abnormal values of the UA pulsatility index (PI) were considered to be above the 95th percentile and below 5th percentile for the MCA PI for gestational week. The difference of UA PI ~0.5 in twin pairs was considered abnormal. Doppler results were compared with selected parameters that characterize the course of pregnancy and fetal outcome.\nAbnormal UA PI as well as the intertwine PI difference of 0.5 and more correlated significantly with lower gestational age at delivery, intertwine growth discordance of 35% or more, lower birth weight, and abnormal fetal outcome. The abnormal cerebra-umbilical(C/U) ratio correlated statistically with lower birth weight, abnormal fetal outcome, and an increased risk of premature delivery. There were no statistically significant differences in the majority of parameters that characterize the neonatal outcome between the groups with normal and abnormal MCA Pl.\nThe intertwine UA PI difference ~0.5 had the highest predictive value in the assessment of adverse fetal outcome and risk for small for gestational age (SGA). Relatively poor sensitivity was noted with regard to the abnormal values of UA PI and C/U ratio. The worse correlation was found in case of MCA Pl.",

One handred and ninteen cases (238 fetuses) with intrapair birthweight difference \u2265 25% were determined as the discordant twins group, and the other 891 cases (1782 fetuses) with intrapair birthweight difference < 25% were identified as the concordant twins group. The singleton control group included 4042 singleton pregnancies in the same period.\n(1) Comparison of clinical data between the twins groups: the birthweight of larger-twin, smaller-twin and intrapair birthweight difference in the discordant twins group and the concordant twins group were (2090 \u00b1 827) g, (1392 \u00b1 592) g, (33.9 \u00b1 9.3)%, and (2408 \u00b1 543) g, (2191 \u00b1 505) g, (8.9 \u00b1 6.5)%, respectively, with significant differences (P < 0.01). The incidence of discordant twins was 11.78% (119/1010). Compared with the concordant twins group, the discordant twins group had higher proportion of monochorionic twins, and higher prevalence of pregnancy complications such as late miscarriage, abnormal umbilical insertion, twin-twin transfusion syndrome and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (P < 0.05). (2) The characteristics of twin birthweight distribution: 1) In all the 2020 twins, 80.05% (1617/2020) fetuses had birthweight below the 50(th) percentile of the singleton control group, while 23.71% (479/2020) feeuses got birthweight below the 10(th) percentile of the singleton control group. 2) After 19(th) gestational week, the 50(th) and 90(th) percentile of all twins' birthweight were lower than those of singletons. After 38(th) gestational week, the birthweight of singletons kept increasing and reached its peak at 41(th) week, while the birthweight of twins reached its peak at 38(th) week, followed by a decline at 39 weeks, which was even lower than the 10(th) percentile of the singleton control group. 3) The distribution of birthweight of larger- and smaller-twin in the discordant twins group: 65 (54.6%, 65/119) larger-twins and one (0.8%, 1/119) smaller-twin had birthweight above the 50(th) percentile of all twins, while 5 (4.2%, 5/119) larger-twins and 97 (81.5%, 97/119) smaller-twins got birthweight below the 10(th) percentile of all twins.\n(1) The patterns of birthweight curves for each gestational week are different between twins and singletons. In order to evaluate the growth of twins, birthweight reference for twins should be employed.

    "abstract": "Little is known about the impact of space (geography/ancestry) and time (age of the individuals) on DNA methylation variability in humans. We investigated DNA methylation of the imprinted IGF2/H19 locus in: i) a cohort of individuals homogeneous for age and gender (males with restricted age range: 30-50 years) belonging to four Italian districts representative of the major genetic clines, informative for the geographical dimension; ii) a cohort of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins of different ages (age-range: 22-97 years), informative for the temporal dimension. DNA methylation of the analyzed regions displayed high levels of inter-individual variability that could not be ascribed to any geographical cline. In MZ twins we identified two IGF2/H19 regions where the intra-couple variations significantly increased after the age of 60 years. The analysis of twins' individual life histories suggests that the within twin pairs difference is likely the result of the aging process itself, as sharing a common environment for long periods had no effect on DNA methylation divergence. On the whole, the data here reported suggest that: i) aging more than population genetics is responsible for the inter-individual variability in DNA methylation patterns in humans; ii) DNA methylation variability appears to be highly region-specific.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the authors investigated the potential contribution of environmental factors and testosterone levels on androgenic alopecia in women.\nNinety-eight identical female twins were recruited from 2009 to 2011. Subjects were asked to complete a comprehensive questionnaire, provide a sputum sample for testosterone analysis, and pose for standardized digital photography. Frontal, temporal, and vertex hair loss were assessed from the photographs using Adobe Photoshop. Hair loss measures were then correlated with survey responses and testosterone levels between twin pairs. Two independent, blinded observers also rated the photographs for hair thinning.\nFactors associated with increased frontal hair loss included multiple marriages (p = 0.043); longer sleep duration (p = 0.011); higher severity of stress (p = 0.034); positive smoking history (p = 0.021); higher income (p = 0.023); absence of hat use (p = 0.017); and history of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.023), polycystic ovarian syndrome (p = 0.002), and hypertension (p = 0.001). Factors associated with increased temporal hair loss included divorce or separation (p = 0.034), multiple marriages (p = 0.040), more children (p = 0.005), longer sleep duration (p = 0.006), and history of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.008) and hypertension (p = 0.027). Lack of sun protection (p = 0.020), consuming less caffeine (p = 0.040), history of skin disease (p = 0.048), and lack of exercise (p = 0.012) were associated with increased vertex hair loss. Higher testosterone levels were associated with increased temporal and vertex hair loss patterns (p < 0.039). Increased stress, increased smoking, having more children, and having a history of hypertension and cancer were all associated with increased hair thinning (p < 0.05).\nThis study implicates several environmental risk factors in the pathophysiology of female alopecia.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate the degree of placenta share discordance in relation to the betamethasone-induced return of positive end-diastolic flow in monochorionic twin pregnancies with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) and abnormal umbilical artery Doppler. Monochorionic twins with sIUGR was defined as one twin having an estimated fetal weight below the 10th percentile combined with an estimated fetal weight discordance >25%. The umbilical artery Doppler directly prior to (D0) and 24 hours (D1) and 48 hours (D2) after the first dose of betamethasone administration was recorded. The estimated individual placental weight in monochorionic twins was obtained by cutting the placenta along the vascular equator into two territories; the placenta share discordance was calculated as [(estimated individual placental weight of appropriated for gestational age twin- estimated individual placental weight of growth restricted twin)/estimated individual placental weight of appropriated for gestational age twin] \u00d7 100%. Six (23.1%) of the 26 included cases achieved betamethasone-induced return of positive umbilical artery end-diastolic flow. The difference of placenta share discordance and birth weight discordance were not significantly different between twins with and without betamethasone-induced return of positive umbilical artery end-diastolic flow. Thus, according to our study results, it was proposed that although the placenta share discordance correlated with the abnormal umbilical artery Doppler in the IUGR fetus in monochorionic twin, the betamethasone-induced return of positive umbilical artery end-diastolic flow, however, did not reveal the similar relationship with the severity of placenta share discordance.",

    "abstract": "We report a rare case of monozygotic (MZ) twins who developed simultaneous onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Laboratory finding showed similar values of blood sugar, pH, glycosylated hemoglobin, and C-peptide. Urinary sugar and ketones were detected in both. Endocrine and immunological assessment showed similar results. No evidence (clinical or serological) of recent viral or bacterial infection was found. In the 4 years of follow-up, the twins also showed a similar course of disease. Concordance rates for T1DM are high in MZ twins; nevertheless, a simultaneous onset and a similar course of disease are unusual, as well as the HLA allelic variants of our patients. This extraordinary concordance in a pair of MZ twins could be the consequence of a greater environmental similarity or the role of genetic factors other than HLA genes in our twins.",

    "abstract": "Nasal carriage is a major risk factor for Staphylococcus aureus infection. Approximately, one-quarter of adults carry S. aureus. However, the role of host genetics on S. aureus nasal carriage is unknown.\nNasal swabs were obtained from a national cohort of middle-aged and elderly Danish twins. Subjects colonized with S. aureus were identified by growth on selective plates and spa typing. A second sample was obtained from twins initially concordant for carriage. Twins found to again be colonized with S. aureus were defined as persistent carriers.\nThe prevalence of S. aureus carriage among 617 twin pairs (monozygotic/dizygotic pairs: 112/505) was 26.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.0%-28.9%). The concordance rate for carriage did not differ significantly between pairs of monozygotic (37.5%; 95% CI, 22.3%-53.8%) twins and same sex (24.2%; 95% CI, 15.4%-34.5%), and opposite sex (21.4%; 95% CI, 12.0%-33.4%) dizygotic twins. Despite shared childhoods, only 1 of 617 pairs was concordant with respect to lineage. Although heritability increased for S. aureus and lineage persistency, no significant heritability was detected.\nIn this study, host genetic factors exhibited only a modest influence on the S. aureus carrier state of middle-aged and elderly individuals.",

Despite shared childhoods, only 1 of 617 pairs was concordant with respect to lineage. Although heritability increased for S. aureus and lineage persistency, no significant heritability was detected.",

    "abstract": "Scleroderma (SSc) is a rare connective tissue disease characterized by fibrosis, microvasculopathy and autoimmune features. The role of genetics is limited in SSc, as suggested by similar concordance rates in monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, while environmental factors may act through epigenetic changes, as demonstrated for specific genes. Further, sex chromosome changes have been reported in SSc and may explain the female preponderance. In the present study we compared the methylation profile of all X chromosome genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from monozygotic twins discordant (n=7) and concordant (n=1) for SSc. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitations from each discordant twin pair were hybridized to a custom-designed array included 998 sites encompassing promoters of all X chromosome genes and randomly chosen autosomal genes. Biostatistical tools identified sites with an elevated probability to be consistently hypermethylated (n=18) or hypomethylated (n=25) in affected twins. Identified genes include transcription factors (ARX, HSFX1, ZBED1, ZNF41) and surface antigens (IL1RAPL2, PGRMC1), and pathway analysis suggests their involvement in cell proliferation (PGK1, SMS, UTP14A, SSR4), apoptosis (MTM1), inflammation (ARAF) and oxidative stress (ENOX2). In conclusion, we propose that X chromosome genes with different methylation profiles in monozygotic twin pairs may constitute candidates for SSc susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "One of the core behavioral features associated with obsessive compulsive symptomatology is the inability to inhibit thoughts and/or behaviors. Neuroimaging studies have indicated abnormalities in frontostriatal and dorsolateral prefrontal - anterior cingulate circuits during inhibitory control in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder compared with controls. In the present study, task performance and brain activation during Stroop color-word and Flanker interference were compared within monozygotic twin pairs discordant for obsessive compulsive symptoms and between groups of pairs scoring very low or very high on obsessive compulsive symptoms, in order to examine the differential impact of non-shared environmental versus genetic risk factors for obsessive compulsive symptomatology on inhibitory control related functional brain activation. Although performance was intact, brain activation during inhibition of distracting information differed between obsessive compulsive symptom high-scoring compared to low-scoring subjects. Regions affected in the discordant group (e.g., temporal and anterior cingulate gyrus) were partly different from those observed to be affected in the concordant groups (e.g., parietal gyrus and thalamus). A robust increase in dorsolateral prefrontal activity during response interference was observed in both the high-scoring twins of the discordant sample and the high-scoring twins of the concordant sample, marking this structure as a possible key region for disturbances in inhibitory control in obsessive compulsive disorder.",

    "abstract": "The development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is under strong genetic control and there is great interest in the genetic variants that confer increased risk. The Alzheimer's disease risk gene, growth factor receptor bound protein 2-associated protein (GAB2), has been shown to provide a 1.27-1.51 increased odds of developing LOAD for rs7101429 major allele carriers, in case-control analysis. GAB2 is expressed across the brain throughout life, and its role in LOAD pathology is well understood. Recent studies have begun to examine the effect of genetic variation in the GAB2 gene on differences in the brain. However, the effect of GAB2 on the young adult brain has yet to be considered. Here we found a significant association between the GAB2 gene and morphological brain differences in 755 young adult twins (469 females) (M = 23.1, SD = 3.1 years), using a gene-based test with principal components regression (PCReg). Detectable differences in brain morphology are therefore associated with variation in the GAB2 gene, even in young adults, long before the typical age of onset of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Fetal growth restriction in singletons has been shown to enhance fetal lung maturation and reduce the risk of respiratory distress syndrome due to increased endogenous steroid production. However, data on lung maturation in growth-discordant monochorionic (thus, identical) twins are lacking. Our objective was to compare the risk of severe neonatal morbidity between the larger and the smaller twin in monochorionic twins with birth weight discordance (BWD). We included in the study all consecutive monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies with severe BWD (\u226525%) and two live-born twins delivered at our center (n=47 twin pairs). We compared the incidence of neonatal morbidity, particularly respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and cerebral lesions between the larger and the smaller co-twin. The incidence of severe neonatal morbidity in the larger and smaller twin was 38% (18/47) and 19% (9/47), respectively (odds ratio (OR) 2.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-7.44) and was due primarily to the higher incidence of RDS, 32% (15/47) and 6% (3/47), respectively (OR 6.88, 95% CI 1.66-32.83). In conclusion, this study shows that the larger twin in monochorionic twin pairs with BWD is at increased risk of severe neonatal morbidity, particularly RDS, compared to the smaller twin.",

    "abstract": "The increasing rates of preterm birth among twins implicate that solid data on associated risks and outcomes are required. Assessment of zygosity is often based on clinical criteria (evaluation of placenta; same gender, birth weight discordance as surrogate criteria for monochorionic/monozygotic twins). The aim of this study was to compare clinical versus genetic assessment of zygosity and to compare causes of preterm delivery as well as outcome data of very-low-birth-weight (VLBW; birth weight <1,500 g) twins stratified to zygosity. In a multicenter study, we selected n=176 sets of same gender twins and determined zygosity genetically. In a subgroup of 123 sets of twins, the attending physicians at the study centers were asked to document the parameter 'zygosity' (monozygotic/dizygotic) on the basis of their clinical judgment. Concordance between genetic and clinical assessment was 62.7% for monozygotic twins and 88.9% for dizygotic twins, respectively. Outcome parameters (death, BPD, ROP, NEC, IVH) were comparable in both groups. Genetically dizygotic twins were significantly more often born due to intrauterine infection (33% vs. 20% in monozygotic twins, p<.01) and antenatal antibiotics were more frequently given to mothers of dizygotic twins (62% vs. 47% in monozygotic twins, p<.01). Obstetric complications such as twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome were only seen in monozygotic twins as expected. The unexpected increase of antenatal antibiotic treatment and birth due to intrauterine infection in dizygotic twins should be confirmed in additional VLBW twin-cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Though multiple policies have been implemented, the cigarette control in China is still facing a great challenge. At the same time, alcohol drinking has increasingly become a public health problem. Considering cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking often co-occur, a few studies tested the covariance of these phenotypes. However, the genetic and environmental correlation between them among Chinese population has not been determined. The main aim of this study is to fill this gap.\nFrom the Chinese National Twin Registry, we obtained the data on cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking behaviors. The ordinal bivariate genetic analysis was performed to fit the categorical variables. After identifying the best decomposition among the Cholesky, common, and independent pathway model, we established the most parsimonious submodel.\nThe correlation between current tobacco and alcohol use could be explained by Cholesky model. The shared environmental variances for both phenotypes were dropped to construct the most parsimonious submodel. Furthermore, the most parsimonious submodel showed a moderate correlation (0.32, 95%CI=0.17-0.46) between the genetic components and a negligible non-shared environmental correlation.\nAs the first bivariate genetic analysis on current tobacco smoking and current alcohol drinking in China, this study suggested a common genetic vulnerability to tobacco and alcohol use in male twins. Further studies should be carried out to track the pertinent genes that are related to the comorbidity of smoking and drinking in Chinese population. Another urgent need is to recognize the behavior-specific environmental risk factors.",

The twins underwent a series of four staged separation procedures over 10 months. The first three stages involved performing gradual circumferential craniotomies, dividing the dura, ligating large and small bridging veins, separating abutting brains, and inserting skin expanders. The fourth stage involved dividing the remaining dura and veins, transecting shared brain tissue not detected in preoperative imaging, replacing dura in twin B, and replacing skin over native dura in twin A. Planning and carrying out separation of the conjoined twins required organization and cooperation of all the disciplines involved to prepare the children preoperatively, care for them perioperatively and postoperatively, and support the mother during the process.",

    "abstract": "The association of FTO gene variants with body mass index (BMI) and other obesity characteristics is well established. However, uncertainties remain whether the association is present only in young populations and whether it is attributable to body fat mass specifically. We aimed to clarify these two questions in a large sample (N= 4,523 individuals) of middle-aged and older (range 40-80 years) British female twins. The women were assessed for BMI, waist and hip circumference, total lean (LBM) and fat (FBM) body mass. Since the majority of FTO association signals have been reported in a haploblock bordering 52,355-52,408 kb (on chromosome 16q12.2), we examined five genotyped and 43 imputed SNPs mapped to this block. Canonical correlation and other association analyses showed significant and consistent association between the selected SNP and studied body composition phenotypes, with p-values reaching p= 0.000004. Of particular interest, in addition to the expected significant associations between FTO variants and FBM, we also identified significant associations with LBM. These results suggest that the association between FTO variants and body composition phenotypes is present across a wide range of ages, and that FTO appears primarily to affect the amount of body soft tissue, influencing both fat and lean mass.",

    "abstract": "Increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) plasma levels have been described to occur during physical exercise. A relative reduction in energy intake after physical activity has also been reported after exercise, indicating a possible involvement of IL-6 as an anorexigenic factor. Given the possible effect of interleukins on appetite, we assessed whether a controlled physical activity bout is related with changes in IL-6, IL-6 soluble receptor (IL-6sR), gp130 and interleukin-18 (IL-18) plasma levels, as well as their relation with post-exercise energy intake. A co-twin intervention study was carried out with five young male monozygotic twin pairs. One co-twin performed 45\u00a0min of submaximal exercise on a treadmill near the anaerobic threshold ending with 7\u00a0min at 90\u00a0% VO(2) max, while his co-twin remained non-active. Ad libitum energy intake was tested through a carbohydrate-rich meal test. Venous blood samples were drawn at baseline, immediately after exercise and after the meal ingestion. Plasma concentrations of IL-6, IL-6sR, gp130 and IL-18 were measured via ELISA. IL-6 plasma levels increased after physical activity bout (2.6-fold change; p\u2009=\u20090.04). A less marked trend, although still significant, was observed for plasma levels of IL-6sR and gp130. Plasma levels of IL-18 did not significantly change during exercise. The twins who exercised exhibited significantly lower energy intake (181 versus 1,195\u00a0kcal; p\u2009=\u20090.04), compared to the co-twins who remained resting. The present study in monozygotic twins shows increased IL-6 plasma levels after acute physical exercise with a significant reduction in energy intake, supporting a linkage between IL-6 and acute post-exercise eating behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Researchers have long been interested in the influence of family size on children's educational outcomes. Simply put, theories have suggested that resources are diluted within families that have more children. Although the empirical literature on developed countries has generally confirmed the theoretical prediction that family size is negatively related to children's education, studies focusing on developing societies have reported heterogeneity in this association. Recent studies addressing the endogeneity between family size and children's education have also cast doubt on the homogeneity of the negative role of family size on children's education. The goal of this study is to examine the causal effect of family size on children's education in Brazil over a 30-year period marked by important social and demographic change, and across extremely different regions within the country. We implement a twin birth instrumental variable approach to the nationally representative 1977-2009 PNAD data. Our results suggest an effect of family size on education that is not uniform throughout a period of significant social, economic, and demographic change. Rather, the causal effect of family size on adolescents' schooling resembles a gradient that ranges from positive to no effect, trending to negative.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify the factors associated with the increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage requiring transfusion in Japanese twin pregnancies in comparison with those in Japanese singleton pregnancies.\nWe reviewed the obstetric records of all singleton and twin deliveries after 22 weeks' gestation at the Japanese Red Cross Katsushika Maternity Hospital from 2003 through 2011. Potential risk factors for transfusion due to hemorrhage after cesarean delivery were selected according to previous studies of postpartum hemorrhage or transfusion or both after delivery: maternal age, parity, previous cesarean deliveries, history of infertility therapies such as in vitro fertilization, gestational age at delivery, neonatal birth weight, placenta previa, uterine myoma\u22656 cm, hypertensive disorders, placental abruption, emergency cesarean deliveries and general anesthesia.\nUsing multiple logistic regression, the independent risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage requiring transfusion in singleton pregnancies were preterm delivery [odds ratio (OR) 2.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-4.6, p<0.01], placenta previa (OR 8.08, 95% CI 3.9-16, p<0.01) and placental abruption (OR 12.8, 95% CI 2.3-76, p<0.01). In twin pregnancies, however, the independent risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage requiring transfusion were gestational age at \u226541 weeks (OR 8.20, 95% CI 1.3-40, p<0.01) and hypertensive disorders (OR 5.45, 95% CI 2.2-14, p<0.01).\nThe factors associated with postpartum hemorrhage requiring transfusion in cesarean deliveries of twins seemed to be different from those in singleton cesarean deliveries.",

    "abstract": "There has been an overall increase in the incidence of multiple pregnancies and assisted reproduction technology is largely responsible for this rise. Although twins may appeal to couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF), they have been associated with serious health consequences to the babies, their mothers and the family unit, as well as having massive financial implications for the National Health Service. Transfer of more than one embryo during IVF is mainly responsible for IVF twins, and elective transfer of a single embryo at a time with cryopreservation of surplus embryos for later transfer has been shown to be an effective strategy to minimise the risk of twins without compromising IVF success rates. Factors that will impact on the success of the policy of elective single embryo transfer (eSET) include improvement in embryo selection for transfer, better cryopreservation techniques and adequate state funding for IVF. However, in implementing the policy of eSET it is important that each case is assessed on an individual basis since in some situations (e.g. in older women) the transfer of two embryos may be more cost effective. Adequate and continuous education of all stakeholders is essential if the policy of eSET is to be successful in the UK.",

    "abstract": "Comparison between groups of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins enables an estimation of the relative contribution of genetic and shared and nonshared environmental factors to phenotypic variability. Using DNA methylation profiling of \u223c20,000 CpG sites as a phenotype, we have examined discordance levels in three neonatal tissues from 22 MZ and 12 DZ twin pairs. MZ twins exhibit a wide range of within-pair differences at birth, but show discordance levels generally lower than DZ pairs. Within-pair methylation discordance was lowest in CpG islands in all twins and increased as a function of distance from islands. Variance component decomposition analysis of DNA methylation in MZ and DZ pairs revealed a low mean heritability across all tissues, although a wide range of heritabilities was detected for specific genomic CpG sites. The largest component of variation was attributed to the combined effects of nonshared intrauterine environment and stochastic factors. Regression analysis of methylation on birth weight revealed a general association between methylation of genes involved in metabolism and biosynthesis, providing further support for epigenetic change in the previously described link between low birth weight and increasing risk for cardiovascular, metabolic, and other complex diseases. Finally, comparison of our data with that of several older twins revealed little evidence for genome-wide epigenetic drift with increasing age. This is the first study to analyze DNA methylation on a genome scale in twins at birth, further highlighting the importance of the intrauterine environment on shaping the neonatal epigenome.",

    "abstract": "To assess the impact of the day of birth on twin mortality in a population sample.\nWe analyzed weekend versus weekday twin births from the United States national twin birth data for the periods 1989-2002. We computed adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to assess the association between infant mortality and weekday of birth using the Cox proportional hazards model.\nThe crude rates for all types of mortality were found to be significantly higher for twins born on weekends than on weekdays. After adjustment, only post-neonatal mortality risk was higher on weekends as compared to weekdays [Hazards ratio (HR)=1.19, CI: 1.04, 1.36]. Twins of white mothers were at greater risk for neonatal death (HR=1.16, CI: 1.08, 1.24) but were less likely to experience post-neonatal death (HR=0.68, CI: 0.64, 0.76) as compared to twins of black mothers. We found an interaction between maternal age and weekday of birth. Twins born on weekends to teenage mothers (age<18) had a 35% greater risk for neonatal death (HR=1.35, CI: 1.06, 1.71) while those born on weekends to older mothers did not show elevated risk for any of the mortality indices.\nIncreased risks for post-neonatal death are significantly higher amongst twins born on weekends as compared to weekdays. Further research is required to identify the detailed differences in structure and procedures that result in the disadvantage associated with weekend birth.",

    "abstract": "The most common pathology in adult patients with temporal lobe epilepsy is hippocampal sclerosis (HS), the etiology of which is not clear. There is a conflicting evidence in literature regarding whether HS is genetic or acquired. Twin studies can help to clarify the mechanisms of HS, but limited numbers of twins have been studied. We describe two monozygotic pairs, in whom the affected twin had mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and HS. The unaffected twin remained seizure free on long-term follow-up. HS was confirmed pathologically in one of the affected twins. Our data and other limited twin studies indicate that HS occurs as a consequence of prolonged repeated seizures or other events during childhood. In other words, some acquired factors may be more important than genetic ones in the etiology of HS (Fig. 2, Ref. 16).",

These infants have abnormal epidermal barrier, which leads to serious complications. It may present with extensive skin lesions and should be considered a diagnostic possibility in sick neonates. Recent studies have identified a condition characterized by deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA) resembling Ichthyosis. We report dizygotic twins that presented lamellar ichthyosis. Twin #1 had a neonatal period complicated with sepsis, fungemia and urinary tract infection. Twin #2 had sepsis, urinary tract infection and conjunctivitis. We tested the parents and one patient for DIRA. Tests were negative. To our knowledge, this is the first case of dizygotic twins that presented with lamellar ichthyosis in Puerto Rico. Physicians should include DIRA in the differential diagnosis of skin lesions in newborns.",

    "abstract": "We used diffusion tensor imaging to assess callosal morphology in 35 pairs of monozygotic twins, of which 17 pairs were concordant for handedness and 18 pairs were discordant for handedness. Functional hemispheric language dominance was established for each twin member using fMRI, resulting in 26 twin pairs concordant and 9 twin pairs discordant for language dominance. On the basis of genetic models of handedness and language dominance, which assume one \"right shift\" (RS) gene with two alleles, an RS+ allele biasing toward right-handedness and left cerebral language dominance and an RS- allele leaving both asymmetries to chance, all twins were classified according to their putative genotypes, and the possible effects of the gene on callosal morphology was assessed. Whereas callosal size was under a high genetic control that was independent of handedness and language dominance, twin pairs with a high probability of carrying the putative RS+ allele showed a connectivity pattern characterized by a genetically controlled, low anisotropic diffusion over the whole corpus callosum. In contrast, the high connectivity pattern exhibited by twin pairs more likely to lack the RS+ allele was under significantly less genetic influence. The data suggest that handedness and hemispheric dominance for speech production might be at least partly dependent on genetically controlled processes of axonal pruning in the corpus callosum.",

Perception towards oral health practices was assessed using a pre-tested questionnaire. The WHO oral health assessment form (1997) was employed to assess the oral health status. Zygosity determination was determined using the medical records, dermatoglyphics and details about chorionicity and number of placental cords. Pearson's correlation was calculated to determine the correlation among the monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs.\nThe monozygotic twin pairs showed a greater correlation compared to the dizygotic twin pairs in dental caries, periodontal disease and malocclusion.\nIn the present study, monozygotic twin pairs showed a higher correlation rate than the dizygotic twin pairs, suggesting considerable evidence that genes play a significant role in the aetiology of dental caries, periodontal disease and malocclusion.",

    "abstract": "Elevated pulse pressure (PP) is associated with cardiovascular disorders and mortality in various populations. The genetic influence on PP has been confirmed by heritability estimates using related individuals. Recently, efforts have been made by mapping genes that are linked to the phenotype. We report the results of our gene mapping studies conducted in the Chinese population in mainland China. The genome-wide linkage and association scans were carried out on 63 middle-aged dizygotic twin pairs using high-density markers. The linkage analysis identified three significant linkage peaks (all with a single point P<1e(-05)) on chromosome 11 (LOD core 4.06 at 30.5 cM), chromosome 12 (LOD score 3.97 at 100.7 cM) and chromosome 18 (LOD score 4.01 at 70.7 cM), with the last two peaks closely overlapping with linkage peaks reported by two American studies. Multiple regions with suggestive linkages were identified, with many of the peaks overlapping with published linkage regions. The genome-wide association analysis detected a suggestive association on chromosome 4 (rs17031508, P<8.34e(-08)) located within a wide region of suggestive linkage. Our results provide some evidence for genetic linkages and associations with PP in the Chinese population. Further investigation is warranted to replicate the findings and to explore the susceptibility loci or genes for PP.",

    "abstract": "Phelan McDermid Syndrome is caused by the loss of genetic material in a chromosome from pair 22, at the band q13.3. We describe five patients with deletion 22q13.3 in order to establish a genotype-phenotype association, and report the first case described in conjoined twins. We analyzed the perinatal history, psychomotor behavior, language, and the presence of minor dysmorphism. Karyotypes and in situ hibridization (FISH) for critical region 22q13.3 were performed to all patients. There were hypotonia, developmental delay, and delay or absence of language. A 22q13.3 deletion was detected in all patients described, two cases had a deletion and the other three had a ring of chromosome 22, one in a pure cell line, while the twins presented mosaicism. Karyotype and FISH for 22q11.2 critical region should be performed, with 22q13.3 control probe to detect the deletion of Phelan McDermid syndrome in all patients with clinical phenotype suggestive and evocative of velo-cardio-facial syndrome.",

Determination of the Bishop score and ultrasound measurement of the cervical length were performed. A regression model was constructed with control for known intrapartum and postpartum confounders.\nOne hundred and forty-six women were analyzed; 18 women (12.3%) had cesarean deliveries during labor. Based on univariate analysis, the Bishop score at 33-35 weeks was significantly associated with the risk of intrapartum cesarean delivery of twins, whereas cervical length, maternal age, height, and weight at 33-35 weeks were not associated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified induction of labor and birth weight of the first-born twin, but not Bishop score, as independent predictors of intrapartum cesarean delivery of twins.\nA low Bishop score at 33-35 weeks of gestation was associated with an increased risk of intrapartum cesarean delivery of twin gestations. However, this relationship disappeared after adjusting for relevant intrapartum or postpartum confounders. Only labor induction and high birth weight of the first-born twin were independently associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery in labor.",

    "abstract": "Most of the complex traits including aging phenotypes are caused by the interaction between genome and environmental conditions and the interface of epigenetics may be a central mechanism. Although modern technologies allow us high-throughput profiling of epigenetic patterns already at genome level, our understanding of genetic and environmental influences on the epigenetic processes remains limited. Twins are of special interest for genetic studies due to their genetic similarity and rearing-environment sharing. The classical twin design has made a great contribution in dissecting the genetic and environmental contributions to human diseases and complex traits. In the era of functional genomics, the valuable sample of twins is helping to bridge the gap between gene activity and the environments through epigenetic mechanisms unlimited by DNA sequence variations. We propose to extend the classical twin design to study the aging-related molecular epigenetic phenotypes and link them with environmental exposures especially early life events. Different study designs and application issues will be highlighted and novel approaches introduced with aim at making uses of twins in assessing the environmental impact on epigenetic changes during development and in the aging process.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the association between first-trimester growth discordance and adverse pregnancy outcome in dichorionic twin pregnancies.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of consecutive women with dichorionic twin pregnancies undergoing an ultrasound scan at our institution between 7 and 14\u2009weeks' gestation. Study groups were defined by the presence or absence of \u2265\u200911% crown-rump length (CRL) discordance. Pregnancies were excluded if one twin was dead on initial ultrasound or if a termination was performed. The primary outcome was loss of one or both fetuses before 20\u2009weeks. Secondary outcomes included fetal anomaly, fetal demise after 20\u2009weeks (stillbirth), small-for-gestational-age (SGA) at birth, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and preterm delivery before 34\u2009weeks.\nOf 805 dichorionic twin pregnancies undergoing first-trimester ultrasound, 610 met the inclusion criteria. Eighty-six had \u2265\u200911% CRL discordance and, of these, nine (10.5%) had a fetal loss at\u2009<\u200920\u2009weeks (risk ratio (RR) 7.8 (95% CI, 3.0-20.5)). In the surviving pregnancies, an increased risk of fetal anomalies was seen (27.3 vs 17.4%, RR 1.6 (95% CI, 1.1-2.4)). In surviving pregnancies unaffected by anomalies, no increased risk of stillbirth, SGA, NICU admission or delivery before 34\u2009weeks was noted in the discordant group. A post-hoc power analysis demonstrated 80% power to detect a five-fold increase in the risk of stillbirth and 90% power to detect a two-fold increase in other outcomes.\nDichorionic pregnancies in which a CRL discordance of at least\u200911% is noted are at increased risk for fetal anomalies and fetal loss prior to 20\u2009weeks' gestation. However, patients can be reassured that, in the absence of structural anomalies, CRL discordance does not appear to be associated with other adverse outcomes in continuing pregnancies, although the power to detect small increases in the risk of stillbirth may have been limited by the sample size.",

    "abstract": "The direction of causation between measures of disrupted sleep, anxiety and depression is not well understood. Under certain conditions, cross-sectional analysis based on genetically informative data can provide important information about the direction of causation between variables. Two community-based samples of 7235 Australian twins aged 18-87 years were mailed an extensive questionnaire that covered a wide range of personality and behavioral measures. Included were self-report measures of disrupted sleep, as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression. Among all females, modeling the direction of causation did not support the hypothesis of sleep having a direct causal impact on risk of anxiety or depression. Among older females, we found evidence that both anxiety and depression interact reciprocally with disrupted sleep, whereas among younger women both anxiety and depression appear to have a causal impact on sleep. Results for males were equivocal. The nosological implications of our findings are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Heteroplasmy, the mixture of mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA), varies among individuals and cells. Heteroplasmy levels alter the penetrance of pathological mtDNA mutations, and the susceptibility to age-related diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Although mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in age-related type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the involvement of heteroplasmy in diabetes is unclear. We hypothesized that the heteroplasmic mutational (HM) pattern may change in T2DM. To test this, we used next-generation sequencing, i.e. massive parallel sequencing (MPS), along with PCR-cloning-Sanger sequencing to analyze HM in blood and skeletal muscle DNA samples from monozygotic (MZ) twins either concordant or discordant for T2DM. Great variability was identified in the repertoires and amounts of HMs among individuals, with a tendency towards more mutations in skeletal muscle than in blood. Whereas many HMs were unique, many were either shared among twin pairs or among tissues of the same individual, regardless of their prevalence. This suggested a heritable influence on even low abundance HMs. We found no clear differences between T2DM and controls. However, we found ~5-fold increase of HMs in non-coding sequences implying the influence of negative selection (P < 0.001). This negative selection was evident both in moderate to highly abundant heteroplasmy (>5% of the molecules per sample) and in low abundance heteroplasmy (<5% of the molecules). Although our study found no evidence supporting the involvement of HMs in the etiology of T2DM, the twin study found clear evidence of a heritable influence on the accumulation of HMs as well as the signatures of selection in heteroplasmic mutations.",

    "abstract": "Cortical surface area has been largely overlooked in genetic studies of human brain morphometry, even though phylogenetic differences in cortical surface area between individuals are known to be influenced by differences in genetic endowment. In this study, we examined the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences on cortical surface areas in both the native and stereotaxic spaces for a cohort of homogeneously-aged healthy pediatric twins. Bilateral hemispheric surface and all lobar surface areas except the occipital lobes in native space showed high heritable estimates, while the common environmental effect on bilateral occipital lobes reached statistical significance. The proportion of genetic variance for cortical surface areas measured in stereotaxic space was lower than that measured in native space, whereas the unique environmental influences increased. This is reasonable since whole brain volume is also known to be heritable itself and so removing that component of areal variance due to overall brain size via stereotaxic transformation will reduce the genetic proportion. These findings further suggest that cortical surface areas involved in cognitive, attention and emotional processing, as well as in creating and retaining of long-term memories are likely to be more useful for examining the relationship between genotype and behavioral phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in neuroscience is finding which genes affect brain integrity, connectivity, and intellectual function. Discovering influential genes holds vast promise for neuroscience, but typical genome-wide searches assess approximately one million genetic variants one-by-one, leading to intractable false positive rates, even with vast samples of subjects. Even more intractable is the question of which genes interact and how they work together to affect brain connectivity. Here, we report a novel approach that discovers which genes contribute to brain wiring and fiber integrity at all pairs of points in a brain scan. We studied genetic correlations between thousands of points in human brain images from 472 twins and their nontwin siblings (mean age: 23.7 \u00b1 2.1 SD years; 193 male/279 female). We combined clustering with genome-wide scanning to find brain systems with common genetic determination. We then filtered the image in a new way to boost power to find causal genes. Using network analysis, we found a network of genes that affect brain wiring in healthy young adults. Our new strategy makes it computationally more tractable to discover genes that affect brain integrity. The gene network showed small-world and scale-free topologies, suggesting efficiency in genetic interactions and resilience to network disruption. Genetic variants at hubs of the network influence intellectual performance by modulating associations between performance intelligence quotient and the integrity of major white matter tracts, such as the callosal genu and splenium, cingulum, optic radiations, and the superior longitudinal fasciculus.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the incidence and predictive factors of poor neurological outcome in survivors of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) treated with fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (FLP).\nBrain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurodevelopmental assessment were performed at a corrected age of 1 year in survivors of TTTS treated by FLP. Severe neurological abnormality was defined as either the presence of severe clinical neurodevelopmental disability or severe anomalies, visualized on MRI of the brain.\nIn a consecutive series of 46 cases treated by FLP, the total survival rate was 66.3%; survival of at least one was 80.4%. Severe neurodevelopment disability was 6.7 % (4/59) and the presence of a severe anomaly on brain imaging was 8.8% (5/57), which combined to a clinical or MRI abnormality rate of 10.5% (6/57). Univariate analysis revealed that early gestational age at delivery was the most significant predictor. However, the multiple logistic regression model did not identify any significant variables.\nIn this small series, we determined a rate of clinical neurologic impairment rate at the age of 1 year of 6.7%, which compares to what has been published.",

    "abstract": "Intellectual deficits are commonly found in schizophrenia patients. These intellectual deficits have been found to be heritable. However, whether the intellectual deficits change over time and, if so, whether the change is related with an increased genetic risk for the disease are not known.\nWe investigated change of intelligence quotient (IQ) in a twin sample of chronically ill schizophrenia patients, the discordant co-twins and healthy controls during a follow-up period of 5 years. A total of 52 twins completed two IQ assessments: nine patients [three monozygotic (MZ) and six dizygotic (DZ)], 10 unaffected co-twins (three MZ and seven DZ) and 33 healthy control twins (21 MZ and 12 DZ).\nA significant interaction effect over time was found between IQ measurement and illness (F=4.22, df=1, p<0.05), indicating that change in IQ over time is significantly different between the groups. A stable course in IQ over time was found in the patients with schizophrenia (mean IQ from 109.78 at baseline to 108.44 at follow-up) relative to both the healthy control twins who showed a small increase (from 114.61 at baseline to 119.18 at follow-up) (t=2.06, p<0.05) and the unaffected co-twins (from 111.60 to 117.60, t=-2.32, p<0.05). IQ change in the unaffected co-twins of schizophrenia patients was comparable with that in healthy control twins (t=-0.49, p=0.63).\nPatients with schizophrenia in the chronic phase of the disease, but not the discordant co-twins, show a lack of increase in IQ, which is probably due to environmental (non-genetic) factors related to the disease.",

    "abstract": "The overall volume of the brain has been found to be under relatively strong genetic control, but the relative strength of genetic and environmental factors on between-person variations in regional cortical thickness in adolescence is still not well understood. Here, we analyzed structural MRI data from 108 14-year-old healthy twins (54 females/54 males) to determine the relative contributions of genes and the environment toward regional variations in gray matter thickness across the cortex. After extracting cortical thickness values at a high spatial resolution, an A/C/E structural equation model that divides the variations into additive genetic (A), shared (C), and unique (E) environmental components was fitted. There was considerable regional variability in the magnitude of genetic influences on cortical thickness after controlling for sex. Regions with genetic contributions of greater than 80% were observed in the prefrontal cortex, predominantly in the bilateral dorsolateral and mesial superior frontal regions. No region showed prominent shared environmental influences, but unique environmental influences of over 80% were found in parietal association regions. The genetic variance for cortical thickness in adolescents in prefrontal regions overlapped with previous findings in adults. However, the unique environmental effects observed in multimodal parietal association cortices with converging inputs from visual, auditory, somatosensory regions, and neighboring secondary association cortices suggest that these regional variations are more shaped by experience and could form targets for early interventions in youth with behavioral disorders.",

    "abstract": "In population-based studies, the prevalence of neurodevelopmental disability is consistently higher in twins than singletons. This is largely because birth weight and gestational age (GA) distributions of twin births are shifted to the left when compared with singleton births, and lower birth weight and lower GA are associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disability. From a pathophysiologic perspective, a question of interest is whether neurodevelopmental outcomes of twins differ from singletons after controlling for covariates. If significant differences in outcomes persist, this would suggest that the twining process itself or something intrinsic to shared life in the womb may be responsible for observed differences. From a clinical perspective, when counseling parents at risk for preterm delivery of twins, it is useful to understand how twin outcomes compare relative to singleton outcomes at the same birth weight or GA. The purpose of this review is to examine the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of twins compared with singletons with control for important covariates.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this article is to review current information regarding the management of twin gestations and discuss optimal pregnancy length and considerations regarding route of delivery. Limited data are available on the timing and mode of delivery for twins. For apparently uncomplicated twin pregnancies, current recommendations suggest the optimal length of gestation is 38 weeks for dichorionic diamniotic twins, 34-36 weeks for monochorionic diamniotic twins, and 32-34 weeks for monoamniotic twins. In general, vaginal trial of labor may be considered for cephalic-cephalic twins and in cases of cephalic-noncephalic twins where the provider's skills and experience allow. Cesarean is recommended in twin gestations with monoamnionicity, noncephalic presenting fetus, and those at high risk for combined vaginal-abdominal delivery. The optimal management of twin deliveries is controversial, with timing and mode of delivery dependent on multiple factors, including chorionicity, amnionicity, provider experience, and fetal presentation.",

    "abstract": "Following a brief introduction I address the relationships of twins from five different perspectives: the Intimate Connection, the Mirror Image and Complementarity, Object- and Self-Representation, Self and Object or Rivalry, and Intersubjective Communication. This approach attempts to understand twin relationships and the individual development of twins in terms of their intense mutual dependence, akin to infantile symbiosis, and in terms of narcissism. In their similarity to each other, twins may choose each other as love objects even as they see themselves in the other. That is, a twin may \"love what he himself is\" or \"someone who was once part of himself.\" This \"type of object-choice \u2026 must be termed 'narcissistic'\" (Freud, 1914, pp. 90, 88). Such \"cathexis of an undifferentiated self-object\" is considered to be \"primary narcissism\" (Burstein, 1977, p. 103). Hoffer (1952) describes primary narcissism as \"the lack of all qualities discriminating between self and not-self, inside and outside\" (p. 33).",

    "abstract": "The Fullerton Virtual Twin Study has been assessing the behaviors of an unusual sibship since 1982. Virtual twins (VTs) are same-age, unrelated siblings reared together since infancy. They replicate the rearing situation of twins but without the genetic link, enabling direct assessment of shared environmental effects on behavior. An updated analysis of IQ data, based on an increased sample of 142 VT pairs (7.87 years, SD=8.22), is presented. Intraclass correlations of .28 (IQ) and .11 (subtest profile) indicated modest shared environmental influences on intelligence. Findings from the Twins, Adoptees, Peers and Siblings (TAPS) project that studies virtual twins and other kinships are described.",

    "abstract": "Left-ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is characterized by prominent myocardial trabeculae with deep intratrabecular recesses. Associated with ventricular dysfunction, LVNC can present in isolation or in conjunction with structural heart defects (i.e., \"nonisolated\" LVNC). Although it was once considered to be difficult and unreliable, successful detection of this condition by way of fetal echocardiography has been well documented. We present what is to our knowledge the first prenatal diagnosis of LVNC in monochorionic-monozygotic twins. Nonisolated LVNC was identified in twins A and B at 23 weeks' gestation. A noncompaction-to-compaction ratio >2 was documented in both cases. Discordance for congenital heart disease was observed in the twins: Twin A presented with pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum, critical tricuspid stenosis, and severe right-ventricular hypoplasia, whereas twin B presented with mild mitral valve dysplasia. Despite an initially complicated postnatal course for twin A, this case shows that it is feasible to achieve good outcomes with accurate prenatal detection and aggressive postnatal management.",

    "abstract": "The congenital vs acquired etiology of pediatric trigger thumb is the subject of considerable debate. Existing case reports of bilateral presentation in identical twins and first-degree familial association support the congenital hypothesis. However, prospective studies have yet to report a neonate presenting with this anomaly at birth. This article describes the first known set of dichorionic, monozygotic identical twins with unilateral trigger thumbs, affecting contralateral (mirror-image) hands and with asynchronous age at presentation (11 months and 18 months, respectively).Pediatric trigger thumb is caused by a mismatch between the flexor pollicis longus tendon and its A1 synovial pulley. Four sets of twins have been previously reported in the literature with trigger thumb. Of these, 3 sets were monozygotic twins who had bilaterally affected thumbs. Together with the absence of trauma, a congenital etiology was suggested. The fact that pediatric trigger thumb is generally seen several months after birth was felt to be due to infants holding their thumbs clutched in their palms until 6 months. However, no confirmed cases of trigger thumb have been diagnosed at birth in several large prospective studies of newborns.In the current case, the asynchronous presentation of unilateral trigger thumbs in identical twins does not support a solely congenital cause. Furthermore, the mirror-image presentation contradicts current embryological understanding of the temporal course of twinning and the determination of laterality. Thus, a multifactorial etiology is supported with both a genetic and acquired component affecting the development of this condition.",

For each pair of twins, the severity of keratoconus in each eye was graded according to the steepest keratometry value and the average difference in score between the MZ and DZ twins compared.\nAll of the MZ twins and four of the five DZ twins were concordant for keratoconus but with differences in age of onset and severity of disease. The subjective age of onset of keratoconus tended to be earlier in the MZ twins (16.4 years, SD 4.66) than in the DZ twins (20.3 years, SD 7.55) (p=0.086). Additional relatives with keratoconus were identified in two (16%) of the families with MZ twins and in three (60%) of the families of DZ twins. The mean difference in severity scores was 1.4 (SD 1.73) for the MZ twins and 3.0 (SD 1.00) for the DZ twins (p=0.035).\nThis data provide evidence that the severity of keratoconus is more concordant in MZ than in DZ twins.

Trisomy 12p mosaicism with a supernumerary der(12)(pter > q12) was detected in approximately 50% of lymphocytes in both children. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) revealed a high grade mosaicism of approximately 77% trisomy 12p cells in buccal smear and 85% in hair follicles in the affected twin, while in the normal developing brother an additional 12p chromosome fragment could not be detected in those tissues. Instead, in 3% of buccal smear and hair follicle cells a minute supernumerary marker chromosome comprising central portions of chromosome 12 was observed. Trisomy 12p mosaicism, confined to the lymphocytes of the unaffected twin, may be due to prenatal twin-to-twin transfusion, explaining the conspicuously discordant clinical phenotype. We discuss the possible sequence of events leading to the cytogenetic findings and compare the clinical phenotype presented in the affected twin with other cases of trisomy 12p and tetrasomy 12p (Pallister-Killian syndrome).",

    "abstract": "To assess neonatal and maternal morbidity in twins \u2265 32 weeks' gestation, related to the changes in planned mode of delivery, a retrospective cohort study was performed, including 185 twin births delivered in the Atrium Medical Centre, Heerlen, during the years 2003-2008. The results were compared with those of an earlier study from our department during the period 1999-2002. Compared with the 1999-2002 cohort, the elective caesarean section rate significantly increased from 17.7% to 36.8%. The secondary caesarean rate significantly decreased from 15.9% to 8.8%, but increased from 1.2% to 3.3% for only twin B. No significant differences in serious neonatal morbidity rates for twins A and B were found between both study periods, neither in the elective caesarean group, nor in the planned vaginal birth group. Serious maternal morbidity was not significantly increased in both groups compared with the 1999-2002 cohort.",

    "abstract": "Renal coloboma syndrome (RCS) is a highly variable syndrome characterized by renal and ocular abnormalities. It is associated in about 50 % of cases with mutations of PAX2, a gene encoding a transcription factor required during development.\nThe case study involves two monozygotic twin sisters with RCS showing highly discordant phenotypes. Twin 1 was antenatally diagnosed with multiple cysts in the right kidney. She had complicated vacuum-assisted delivery with acute renal failure. She developed proteinuria at age 4 years, followed by a progressive rise in serum creatinine requiring renal replacement therapy at age 22. No ocular abnormalities have been detected. Twin 2 experienced rapidly reversible acute renal failure without renal morphological abnormalities at birth. At age 2 years, complete visual acuity loss of the left eye secondary to an optic disc coloboma was diagnosed. No significant events occurred until the age of 20, when clinical proteinuria was detected. Proteinuria remission was obtained by multidrug treatment. In both patients, a novel de novo mutation of PAX2 was detected, which leads to the substitution of a highly conserved cysteine (p.C52Y).\nThe patients described provide an extreme example of clinical variability in RCS. The role of environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors is discussed.",

    "abstract": "We assessed vascular programming in genetically identical monochorionic twin pairs with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) treated differently in utero by serial amnioreduction or fetal laser arterial photocoagulation. This case-control study re-assessed four twin groups at median 11 years comprising 20 pairs of monochorionic diamniotic twins: nine treated by amnioreduction (TTTS-amnio) and eleven by laser (TTTS-laser) with seven monochorionic and six dichorionic control pairs. Outcome measures were current blood pressure (BP), brachio-radial arterial stiffness derived from pulse wave velocity (PWV), resting microcirculation (Flux) and response to heating and post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia measured using laser Doppler. Potential confounders [PWV and BP at first study, current height, weight, heart rate and twin type (ex-recipient, ex-donor or heavier/lighter of pair)] were accounted for by Mixed Linear Models statistical methodology. PWV dichorionic > monochorionic (P = 0.024); systolic and diastolic BP dichorionic > TTTS-amnio and TTTS-laser (P = 0.004, P = 0.02 and P = 0.005, P = 0.02, respectively). Within-twin pair pattern of PWV discordance was similar in laser treated and dichorionic controls (heavier-born > lighter), opposite to TTTS-amnio and monochorionic controls. Flux monochorionic > dichorionic (P = 0.044) and heavier > lighter-born (P = 0.024). TTTS-laser and dichorionic diamniotic showed greatest hyperaemic responses (dichorionic > TTTS-amnio or monochorionic controls (P = 0.007, P = 0.025). Hyperaemic responses were slower in heavier-born twins (P = 0.005). In summary, monochorionic twins had lower BP, arterial stiffness and increased resting vasodilatation than dichorionic twins implying shared fetal circulation affects vascular development. Vascular responses in laser-TTTS were similar to dichorionic and opposite to TTTS-amnio suggesting a lasting effect of fetal therapy on vascular health.",
