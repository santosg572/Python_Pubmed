    "abstract": "A case report of monozygotic (MZ) twins with Crouzon syndrome was previously published to highlight variables in clinical presentation. The postnatal and epigenetic causes for this variation are not well understood. An 8-year follow-up discusses their pertinent clinic course with consideration of genetic and nongenetic variables. The phenotypic and symptomatic obstacles encountered since their initial assessment are reviewed, and the use of three-dimensional Medical Modeling (Golden, CO) as a preoperative planning strategy is addressed. Analyzing the longitudinal clinical course of MZ twins with syndromic craniosynostosis will help better predict and provide optimal treatment.",

    "abstract": "Job's syndrome or autosomal dominant hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (Hyper-IgE) is a rare disorder that results from a STAT3 gene mutation, which results in the absence of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells and manifests as a severe immunodeficiency. Affected individuals suffer recurrent soft tissue and pulmonary infections among other manifestations, and the spectrum of the disease is still being characterized. We describe 2 sisters with Job's syndrome each with variable expressivity. However, both patients developed proteinuric kidney disease and had biopsies confirming the presence of immune complex glomerulonephritis with staining for immunoglobulins and complement components. Previous reports link Job's syndrome and the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but proliferative immune complex glomerulonephritis has not been described. We speculate that continual internal and external antigen exposure may induce an autoimmune process similar to SLE, which in turn may account for the immune complex disease in the kidney.",

    "abstract": "Acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. First described by Brandt in 1936 and was named by Danbolt. A mutation in the SLC39A4 gene on chromosome 8 q24.3 is responsible for this disorder, which encodes zinc transporter Zip4. The diagnosis is made by the clinical presentation and histopathology and laboratory tests. In this case, we reported a twin presented with a typical rash and low zinc level. To our knowledge, very few cases reported as a twin with typical acrodermatitis enteropathica presentation.\nFour months old twins both females, first children of a non-consanguineous marriage. The twins were born at term, caesarian section, with no complications. Presented with erythema, scaling, crusting and oozing over perioral, perianal areas, hands and feet of 2-3 week duration. The lesions started around the same time for both children with a history of intermittent diarrhea, and hair loss. There were no nail changes or neurological deficit or myopathy. There was a history of recent weaning from breast milk and now both children on formula feeds, ragi, fruits. There was no other significant history of other medical problems in the patients or in their family. On examination, erythema, scaling, crusting and oozing over perioral, perianal areas, hands and feet was seen. Minimal diffuse alopecia was noted. Nails were normal. No other abnormalities were observed. Clinical diagnosis of acrodermatitis enteropathica was considered and confirmed by low zinc levels (repeated plasma zinc levels were below 0.6 mcg/ml). The twins were managed with zinc supplementation 1 mg/kg/day. A significant improvement was seen within two weeks.\nEarly diagnosis of acrodermatitis enteropathica is essential for preventing complications. We report a rare case of typical clinical presentation of the disease developing simultaneously in twins.",

    "abstract": "Mature cystic teratomas are the most common among all ovarian neoplasms, representing 30-40% of the cases. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been only two reports of mature cystic teratomas occurring in identical twins to date. We herein report a case of identical twins with mature cystic teratomas who were treated with laparoscopic surgery. A 32-year-old woman was referred to our hospital due to a tumor in the right ovary. The patient underwent laparoscopic resection of the ovarian tumor and the pathological diagnosis was benign mature cystic teratoma. Two years later, the identical twin of the abovementioned patient was referred to our hospital also due to a right ovarian tumor. The patient underwent laparoscopic resection of the ovarian tumor and the pathological diagnosis was benign mature cystic teratoma. Therefore, for early diagnosis, it may be important to consider the possibility of mature cystic teratoma in the identical twin of a patient, even in the absence of symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Twins are associated with a delayed development and cerebral palsy. The purpose of this work was to compare the neurologic morbidity in very preterm or very low birth weight dichorionic and monochorionic twins with singletons.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of livebirths lowest through 32 weeks of gestation or very low weight infants admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of a level III hospital, between 2006 and 2010. Development was evaluated with the Growing Skills II Scale at 24 months of age. Cerebral palsy was defined by predetermined criteria by Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe. Infants were analyzed as twins and singletons cohort. Within the twin category the infants were further separated as dichorionic and monochorionic and were compared with singletons infants. Logistic regression models were used to control for demographic and clinical factors.\nThe cohort of infants who were assessed for neurodevelopmental impaired, consisted of 194 singletons infants and 89 twins (50 dichorionic; 39 monochorionic). Monochorionic twins, when compared with the singletons, showed an increased risk of severe developmental delay in these areas: locomotion (adjusted OR 12.2) language (adjusted OR 6.5) and autonomy (adjusted OR 7.2). Cerebral palsy was diagnosed in 4.1% of singleton infants and 15.4% of monochorionic twins. The adjusted risk of severe developmental delay and cerebral palsy in monochorionic twins was 3.6 and 4.2, respectively.\nThis work showed higher rate of moderate and severe neurodevelopment delay including cerebral palsy in monochorionic twins compared to singletons infants. Analysis by groups stratified according to gestational age and comparison of monochorionic and dichorionic twins displayed the role of chorionicity for these neurodevelopmental disorders.\nIn our sample the monochorionic twins are associated with an independent risk of neurodevelopmental delay.\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o: Estudos evidenciaram maior taxa de altera\u00e7\u00f5es do neurodesenvolvimento nos g\u00e9meos em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos rec\u00e9m-nascidos\u00a0de gesta\u00e7\u00e3o unifetal.

A avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do neurodesenvolvimento foi realizada aos 24\u00a0meses, com a escala de Growing Skills II. No diagn\u00f3stico de paralisia cerebral usou-se a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o internacional de Surveillance of\u00a0Cerebral Palsy in Europe. Foram comparados rec\u00e9m-nascidos de gesta\u00e7\u00e3o unifetal com rec\u00e9m-nascidos de gravidez m\u00faltipla e com os\u00a0subgrupos: monocori\u00f3nicos e bicori\u00f3nicos. An\u00e1lise estat\u00edstica pelo SPSS vers\u00e3o 20.0. Foi aplicado um modelo de regress\u00e3o log\u00edstica. Resultados: Foram avaliados 194 rec\u00e9m-nascidos do grupo gesta\u00e7\u00e3o unifetal e 89 g\u00e9meos - 50 bicori\u00f3nicos e 39 monocori\u00f3nicos.\u00a0Os g\u00e9meos monocori\u00f3nicos apresentaram maior risco, em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao grupo de gesta\u00e7\u00e3o unifetal, de altera\u00e7\u00f5es moderadas a graves\u00a0do neurodesenvolvimento global (OR ajustado 3,6) e nas sub\u00e1reas: locomo\u00e7\u00e3o (OR ajustado 12,2) linguagem (OR ajustado 6,5) e autonomia\u00a0(OR ajustado 7,2). A paralisia cerebral foi diagnosticada em 15,4% dos g\u00e9meos monocori\u00f3nicos e 4,1% de gesta\u00e7\u00e3o unifetal(OR ajustado 4,2). Discuss\u00e3o: Este trabalho evidenciou taxa superior de altera\u00e7\u00f5es moderadas a graves do neurodesenvolvimento, incluindo a paralisia\u00a0cerebral nos g\u00e9meos monocori\u00f3nicos em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao grupo de gesta\u00e7\u00e3o unifetal. A an\u00e1lise por grupos estratificados em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 idade\u00a0gestacional e a compara\u00e7\u00e3o de monocori\u00f3nicos com bicori\u00f3nicos alertou para o papel da corionicidade na base destas sequelas. Conclus\u00e3o: Podemos concluir que os g\u00e9meos monocori\u00f3nicos apresentaram, na popula\u00e7\u00e3o estudada, um risco significativo de sequelasmoderadas a graves do neurodesenvolvimento.",

    "abstract": "LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) remains the primary goal for hypolipidemic therapy as a representative of atherogenic LDL particles. In patients at very high risk, its level should be in the range 0.9-1.6 mmol/l. In patients with progression of atherosclerosis despite treatment, an important role could play high level of lipoprotein (a) - Lp(a), particle with a high atherothrombotic potential. Until now, it was difficult to reduce LDL-C to the desired range by recent therapy: combination of lifestyle changes, high doses of strong statins and ezetimibe. Lp(a) was not affected by these measures at all. Recently, we have the opportunity to reduce significantly LDLc and Lp(a), by two treatment modalities. The first is a lipoprotein apheresis that reduces LDL-C and Lp(a) by 60-80 %. The second one are inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 which lower LDL-C similarly to lipoprotein apheresis; Lp(a), approximately by 25 %. Both methods, or their combination could, therefore, significantly affect prognosis of patients with atherosclerosis out of control, in which the treatment by available therapy have not been successful or not possible for intolerance especially in the case of statins.Key words: LDL cholesterol - lipoprotein (a) - lipoprotein apheresis - PCSK9 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) being the most common type of primary malignant liver tumour, with a typically poor prognosis, growing incidence and a well-documented relationship with chronic inflammation factors of the liver tissue. Despite the fact that family medical history has been identified as a risk factor for the development of HCC, its significance in terms of etiopathogenesis and prognosis is not well documented. With a view to contributing to this discussion, we will report the clinical case of two identical twins with HCC, both diagnosed within a short period of time, by providing relevant clinical data, and relating this to other medical literature reports that could contribute to a deeper understanding of this illness.",

Instrumental vaginal delivery was performed among 89 women (18.8%), and 165 (34.8%) women underwent emergency cesarean delivery. Delivery of the second twin by emergency cesarean (n=31) was predominantly for fetal distress (13 [41.9%]) or abnormal lie (10 [32.3%]).

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the factors that influence breastfeeding throughout the hospital stay, including prenatal preparation, early skin-to-skin contact directly after delivery, rooming-in, feeding before the first breastfeed, time to first breastfeed, and postpartum support. This study also aimed to verify whether these factors were significant after adjusting for the mother's characteristics, the newborn's characteristics, and the delivery characteristics.\nA retrospective survey was used to collect the data. Factors that influenced breastfeeding throughout the hospital stay, and differences between the types of newborns were analyzed.\nAmong twins, a higher likelihood of breastfeeding throughout the hospital stay was associated with not feeding before the first breastfeeding and an earlier start time for the first breastfeeding. Among singletons, a higher likelihood of breastfeeding throughout the hospital stay was associated with early skin-to-skin contact, no other feeding before the first breastfeed, and an earlier commencement of the first breastfeed.\nEffort should encourage early breastfeeding, without restriction, to improve the breastfeeding rate among mothers of twins. Moreover, an individualized approach that addresses the factors that influence breastfeeding for each type of newborn may help improve the corresponding rates of breastfeeding throughout the hospital stay.",

    "abstract": "Background - Neonatal lupus erythematosus is an uncommon acquired autoimmune disease caused by transplacental passage of maternal antibodies SSA/Ro, SSB/La or U1 ribonucleoproteins. The most common clinical manifestations are skin rash, cardiac lesions, thrombocytopenia, anemia and hepatosplenomegaly. Complete congenital heart block is usually irreversible needing a pacemaker implantation in two-thirds of cases. Cases report - We report neonatal lupus erythematosus with complete congenital heart block in twins. Newborns were delivered by caesarean section at week 38 of gestation with a heart rate regular at 70 beats per minute. Both twins and mother were positive for antinuclear, anti-SSA, and anti-SSB antibodies. Twins received single-chamber pacemaker implants at day 12 of life. The evolution was immediately favorable with a heart rate around 110 beats per minute. The follow-up was 2 years. The twins are currently asymptomatic. Conclusion - Complete congenital heart block is the most serious manifestation of the neonatal lupus erythematosus associated with significant morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Heteropagus twins are an extremely rare event with an incidence of 1-2 million live births that represents, sometimes, a real challenge for paediatric surgeons. The majority of cases have complete or partial duplication of the pelvis and/or lower extremities. Thoracic heteropagus conjoined twins is a rare condition in which a grossly defective foetus (the parasite) is attached to the thorax of the main foetus (the autosite). We describe a case of a parasitic heteropagus attached at the chest wall with a rare presentation of giant exomphalos on the autosite. In this situation, the separation procedure was simple after a well-done anatomic study using X-ray, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance and echocardiogram are performed.",

    "abstract": "Detection and evaluation of the mismatch between the intended and actually obtained result of an action (reward prediction error) is an integral component of adaptive self-regulation of behavior. Extensive human and animal research has shown that evaluation of action outcome is supported by a distributed network of brain regions in which the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a central role, and the integration of distant brain regions into a unified feedback-processing network is enabled by long-range phase synchronization of cortical oscillations in the theta band. Neural correlates of feedback processing are associated with individual differences in normal and abnormal behavior, however, little is known about the role of genetic factors in the cerebral mechanisms of feedback processing. Here we examined genetic influences on functional cortical connectivity related to prediction error in young adult twins (age 18, n=399) using event-related EEG phase coherence analysis in a monetary gambling task. To identify prediction error-specific connectivity pattern, we compared responses to loss and gain feedback. Monetary loss produced a significant increase of theta-band synchronization between the frontal midline region and widespread areas of the scalp, particularly parietal areas, whereas gain resulted in increased synchrony primarily within the posterior regions. Genetic analyses showed significant heritability of frontoparietal theta phase synchronization (24 to 46%), suggesting that individual differences in large-scale network dynamics are under substantial genetic control. We conclude that theta-band synchronization of brain oscillations related to negative feedback reflects genetically transmitted differences in the neural mechanisms of feedback processing. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence for genetic influences on task-related functional brain connectivity assessed using direct real-time measures of neuronal synchronization.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are debilitating psychiatric disorders with partially shared symptomatology including psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment. Aberrant levels of microglia and neurodegenerative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers have previously been found in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We aimed to analyze familial and environmental influences on these CSF markers and their relation to psychiatric symptoms and cognitive ability. CSF was collected from 17 complete twin pairs, nine monozygotic and eight dizygotic, and from one twin sibling. Two pairs were concordant for schizophrenia, and 11 pairs discordant for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder, and four pairs were not affected by psychotic disorders. Markers of microglia activation [monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), chitinase 3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), and soluble cluster of differentiation 14 (sCD14)], markers of \u03b2-amyloid metabolism (A\u03b2X-38, A\u03b2X-40, A\u03b2X-42 and A\u03b21-42), soluble amyloid precursor proteins (sAPP-\u03b1 and sAPP-\u03b2), total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (P-tau), and CSF/serum albumin ratio were measured in CSF using immunoassays. Heritability of the CSF markers was estimated, and associations to psychiatric and cognitive measurements were analyzed. Heritability estimates of the microglia markers were moderate, whereas several neurodegenerative markers showed high heritability. In contrast, A\u03b2X-42, A\u03b21-42, P-tau and CSF/serum albumin ratio were influenced by dominant genetic variation. Higher sCD14 levels were found in twins with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder compared to their not affected co-twins, and higher sCD14-levels were associated with psychotic symptoms. The study provides support for a significant role of sCD14 in psychotic disorders and a possible role of microglia activation in psychosis.",

    "abstract": "In this paper is presented the first original document of the delivery of conjoined twins on the territory of the present-day Vojvodina. The document number 1224 consists of two handwritten quires. On the first page of the first quire are a description and a drawing of the delivered twins. The delivery was described and drawn by Dr. Ernest Furjakovi\u0107, a shire physician in Ruma and the secondary physicus of the Srem County, who attended and handled the delivery. The conjoined twins were delivered in the night between 2 and 3 April 1852 in Mali Radinci, a small village in the Srem County nearby Ruma, in the far south of the Habsburg Monarchy. The twins, preserved in alcohol, were sent to Budapest to the professor of anatomy \"for the purposes of medical science\", as he wrote in the report. The second quire of the same document refers to the proof that the Commissariat in Ruma forwarded the doctor's report to the High Land Government in Timisoara. In the introduction, the authors displayed the known facts on the occurrence of conjoined twins in the world, which were used to compare with the described case. The data refer to the incidence of conjoined twins in the population, theory of its embryonic origin, their classification, treatment in cases of diagnosed pregnancy and the manner of their delivery. They also refer to the procedures of modern diagnostics, the possibilities of their surgical disjoin and related ethical questions. After that comes a part of the work dedicated to the analysis of the shown document, and the comparison of the several cases of the most significant conjoined twins in the world with these from Srem, as the authors named them. The authors showed short biography of the physician who delivered them, as well. At the end, they conclude that this work gives the first description of document of the delivery of the first known conjoined twins on the territory of the present-day Vojvodina.\nU radu je dan prikaz prvog originalnog dokumenta o ro\u0111enju spojenih blizanaca na teritoriju dana\u0161nje Vojvodine. Dokument pod brojem 1224 sastoji se od dva rukopisna arka. Na prvoj strani prvog arka nalazi se opis i crte\u017e poro\u0111enih blizanaca. Nacrtao ih je i opisao dr Ernest Furjakovi\u0107, pokrajinski lije\u010dnik u Rumi i sekundarni fizikus Sremske \u017eupanije, koji je prisustvovao i rukovodio poro\u0111ajem. Poro\u0111aj se dogodio u no\u0107i izme\u0111u 2. i 3. travnja 1852. godine u Malim Radincima, malom selu u Sremskoj \u017eupaniji, nedaleko od Rume, na krajnjem jugu Habsbur\u0161ke monarhije. Blizance je, konzervirane u alkoholu, poslao profesoru anatomije u Pe\u0161ti, \u201eza potrebe medicinske znanosti\u201c, kako je u izvje\u0161taju naveo. Drugi arak istog dokumenta odnosi se na potvrdu da je tada\u0161nji Komesarijat u Rumi proslijedio doktorov izvje\u0161taj Visokoj Zemaljskoj Vladi u Temi\u0161varu. U uvodnom dijelu rada autori su iznijeli do sada poznate podatke o pojavi spojenih blizanaca u svijetu, koji su kori\u0161teni radi uspore\u0111ivanja s prikazanim slu\u010dajem. Podaci se odnose na u\u010destalost pojave spojenih blizanaca u populaciji, postoje\u0107e teorije o njihovom nastanku u toku embriogeneze, njihovu klasifikaciju, postupak u slu\u010dajevima dijagnosticirane trudno\u0107e sa spojenim blizancima i na\u010dinu njihovog poro\u0111aja. Tako\u0111er se odnose na postupke suvremene dijagnostike, na mogu\u0107nosti njihovog kirur\u0161kog razdvajanja i eti\u010dka pitanja koja ono sa sobom nosi. Slijedi segment rada koji je posve\u0107en analizi prikazanog dokumenta, kao i uspore\u0111enju nekolicine slu\u010dajeva najzna\u010dajnijih spojenih blizanaca u svijetu sa slu\u010dajem spojenih blizanaca iz Srema, kako su ih autori rada nazvali. Autori su prikazali i kratku biografiju lije\u010dnika koji je blizance porodio. Na koncu zaklju\u010duju da je ovim radom dat prvi prikaz dokumenta o ro\u0111enju prvih do danas poznatih spojenih blizanaca na teritoriju dana\u0161nje Vojvodine.",

    "abstract": "Coming from a single zygote, monozygotic (MZ) twins share nearly all of their genetic materials and are almost strikingly similar in appearance. Yet they are often discordant for important phenotypes including complex diseases. The study of discordant MZ twins allows us to understand the role of epigenetics in complex traits by controlling many potential confounders, such as genetic factors, maternal effects, age and sex. As we know, DNA methylation is the most stable epigenetic modification. In human, many causal genes, regulating disease status by DNA methylation modification in imprinting disorders, psychological disorders, autoimmune diseases and cancers, have been discovered, which provides a foundation for studying epigenetic regulation of diseases and application of epigenetic drugs. This article reviews the latest findings on DNA methylation status, estimates of DNA methylation heritability as well as studies of DNA methylation regulation in complex traits using MZ twins, in order to provide reference for research on epigenetic modification in complex traits.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have shown that the in utero environment, which can be indexed by birth weight (BW), is associated with cortical morphology in adolescence and adulthood. Work in monozygotic (MZ) twins suggests that this association is driven by non-shared environmental factors. This correlation could be the result of in utero impacts on DNA methylation. The aim of the present study with MZ twins is to replicate the association between discordance in BW and brain morphology and test whether discordance in DNA methylation mediates this relationship.\nOne hundred and four adolescent MZ twins (52 pairs, of which 42% were male pairs) who have been followed regularly since birth underwent T1 weighted structural MRI, and epigenome-wide assessment of DNA methylation from saliva at age 15.\nCo-twins had very similar measures of DNA methylation and cortical morphology. Higher BW members of a twin pair had increased total cortical surface area, and decreased cortical thickness compared to their lower BW sibling. BW Discordance was positively associated with both cortical surface area and cortical volume discordance. Genes involved in neurodevelopment were tentatively identified as mediators of both the BW - cortical volume, and BW- cortical surface area relationships.\nThe association between BW and cortical morphology in adolescence appears to be attributable to in utero environmental effects, and DNA methylation may play a role in mediating this relationship.

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS)-associated transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) or acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) in monozygotic twins is exceedingly rare and has not been well characterized.\nWe describe a unique case of monozygotic twins with simultaneous TAM from a triplet pregnancy at 34 weeks' gestation. Previously reported cases of TAM and DS-AMKL in monozygotic twins have been reviewed to compare with our cases. The current concept of a sequential multistep process in leukemogenesis and disease evolution of TAM into DS-AMKL through the collaboration among trisomy 21, GATA1, and other gene mutations is also reviewed.\nDistinct GATA1 mutations are identified in our neonate twins with TAM from a triplet pregnancy, whereas precisely identical GATA1 mutations have been detected in all three monozygotic DS twins reported in the literature.\nIdentical GATA1 mutations in cases of monozygotic twins are likely derived from twin-twin transmission. Distinct GATA1 mutations identified in our neonate twins with TAM provide unequivocal evidence of independent intra-utero GATA1 mutations, a completely different mechanism of development of TAM in monozygotic twins from previously reported cases. Interaction of trisomy 21 and GATA1 mutation produces TAM, but additional gene mutations are required for TAM to transform into DS-AMKL.",

    "abstract": "Target genes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been identified. In monozygotic twins discordant for AD we analysed the expression of selected genes, and their possible regulation by epigenetic mechanisms in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, possibly useful to discover biomarkers. Amyloid precursor protein, sirtuin 1 and peptidyl prolyl isomerase 1 gene expressions were highly up-regulated in the AD twin versus the healthy one. Consistently with sirtuin 1 role in controlling acetylation status, we observed a substantial reduction of the acetylation on histone 3 lysine 9, associated with gene transcription in the AD twin. Noteworthy in the AD twin we also observed an increased gene expression in two histone deacetylases (HDACs) isoforms: HDAC2 and HDAC9. A general DNA hypomethylation of all gene promoters studied was also observed in both twins. Our results unravel transcriptional and epigenetic differences potentially helpful to better understand environmental factors and phenotypic differences in monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies with moderate sample sizes are underpowered, especially when testing SNP alleles with low allele counts, a situation that may lead to high frequency of false-positive results and lack of replication in independent studies. Related individuals, such as twin pairs concordant for a disease, should confer increased power in genetic association analysis because of their genetic relatedness. We conducted a computer simulation study to explore the power advantage of the disease-concordant twin design, which uses singletons from disease-concordant twin pairs as cases and ordinary healthy samples as controls. We examined the power gain of the twin-based design for various scenarios (i.e., cases from monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for a disease) and compared the power with the ordinary case-control design with cases collected from the unrelated patient population. Simulation was done by assigning various allele frequencies and allelic relative risks for different mode of genetic inheritance. In general, for achieving a power estimate of 80%, the sample sizes needed for dizygotic and monozygotic twin cases were one half and one fourth of the sample size of an ordinary case-control design, with variations depending on genetic mode. Importantly, the enriched power for dizygotic twins also applies to disease-concordant sibling pairs, which largely extends the application of the concordant twin design. Overall, our simulation revealed a high value of disease-concordant twins in genetic association studies and encourages the use of genetically related individuals for highly efficiently identifying both common and rare genetic variants underlying human complex diseases without increasing laboratory cost.",

    "abstract": "The single stillbirth long-term intrauterine retention in dichorionic twin pregnancy is rarely reported. Also, the birth of a fetus is followed in most cases by immediate expulsion of the second twin. We hereby present an unusual case of asynchronous delivery of dichorionic twins, associating discordance for major and minor anomaly. The intrauterine death of the twin A, presenting a large sacrococcygeal tumor, occurred in the second trimester. The deceased twin A was born at 29 weeks' gestational age (GA). The twin B was extracted by Caesarean section at 31 weeks and had a good outcome. We performed a close follow-up of the high-risk pregnancy and we used tocolytic and antibiotic drugs for prolonging it. Corticoid therapy was administered for the lung maturation of the second twin. The expectant management in the single twin stillbirth dichorionic pregnancy and the asynchronous delivery had a significant impact on the newborn outcome.",

    "abstract": "There is limited research investigating educational attainment as a risk factor for low back pain (LBP), with the influence of gender commonly being neglected. Furthermore, genetics and early shared environment explain a substantial proportion of LBP cases and need to be controlled for when investigating risk factors for LBP.\nTo investigate whether educational attainment affects the prevalence and risk of LBP differently in men and women while controlling for the influence of genetics and early shared environment.\nThis is a cross-sectional and prospective twin case-control study.\nAdult monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins from the Murcia Twin Registry, with available data on educational attainment, formed the base sample for this study. The prevalence analysis considered twins with available data on LBP in 2013 (n=1,580). The longitudinal analysis considered twins free of LBP at baseline (2009-2011), with available data on LBP at follow-up (2013) (n=1,077).\nData on the lifetime prevalence of activity limiting LBP (outcome) and educational attainment (risk factor) were self-reported.\nThe prevalence analysis investigated the cross-sectional association between educational attainment and LBP, whereas the longitudinal analysis investigated whether educational attainment increased the risk of developing LBP. Both analyses were performed in the following sequence. First, a total sample analysis was performed on all twins (considering them as individuals), adjusting for confounding variables selected by the data. Second, to control for the influence of genetics and early shared environment, a within-pair case-control analysis (stratified by zygosity) was performed on complete twin pairs discordant for LBP (ie, one twin had LBP, whereas the co-twin did not). All analyses were stratified for gender where possible, with an interaction term determining whether gender was a significant moderator of the association between educational attainment and LBP.\nWomen with either general secondary or university education were less likely to experience (prevalence analysis) or to develop LBP (longitudinal analysis). Educational attainment did not affect the risk of LBP in men. When controlling for the effects of genetics and early shared environment, the relationship between educational status and LBP in women was no longer statistically significant.\nEducational attainment affects LBP differently in men and women, with higher levels of education only decreasing the risk of developing LBP in women. After adjusting for genetics and early shared environment, the relationship between educational attainment and LBP in women disappears. This suggests that genetics and early shared environment are confounding the relationship between educational attainment and LBP in women.",

    "abstract": "The beta-thalassemia trait is a heterozygous beta-thalassemia characterized by a partial deficiency of the synthesis of beta-globin chains of hemoglobin. It is usually asymptomatic and the diagnosis is often made on the occasion of the completion of a systematic blood count or a family survey. Clinical expression during the neonatal period is impossible and its association with hereditary spherocytosis is common. We report two monozygotic twins who, on the 3rd day of life, presented intense jaundice, unconjugated bilirubin associated with anemia, without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests found nonimmune hemolytic anemia with microcytosis and hypochromia justifying iterative blood transfusions. The etiological investigation found heterozygous beta-thalassemia associated with hereditary spherocytosis. The family investigation and molecular analysis objectified the beta-thalassemic mutation IVS1nt110 (G\u2192A) in the heterozygous state in the twins, the father, the mother, and in one of the two brothers. With any nonimmune hemolytic anemia in newborns, the etiological investigation should be systematic for early diagnosis and to plan appropriate treatment.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to study the differences in haemoglobin (Hb) at birth in dichorionic (DC) versus monochorionic (MC) twins in relation to birth order and mode of delivery.\nAll consecutive DC twin pregnancies and uncomplicated MC twin pregnancies with two live-born twins delivered at our centre were included in this retrospective cohort study. Hb levels at birth and on day 2 were evaluated in association with birth order and mode of delivery. The occurrence of polycythaemia (venous haematocrit >65%) was also recorded.\nA total of 300 DC and 290 MC twin pairs were included. In DC and MC twins delivered vaginally, second-born twins had a higher Hb level at birth compared with their co-twin (mean Hb level 16.7 vs 15.9\u2005g/dL (p<0.01) in DC twins and 17.8 vs 16.1\u2005g/dL (p<0.01) in MC twins). In twins delivered through caesarean section, no intertwin differences in Hb levels were detected. Polycythaemia occurred significantly more often in second-born twins compared with first-born twins delivered vaginally: 10 (5%) vs 2 (1%) (p=0.02) in DC twins and 20 (12%) vs 2 (1%) (p<0.01) in MC twins.\nSecond-born DC and MC twins delivered vaginally have higher Hb levels at birth compared with first-born twins. Intertwin Hb differences in MC twins may partly be related to blood transfusion through the vascular anastomoses. Since DC twins do not have anastomoses, other factors may lead to Hb differences, including differences in timing of umbilical cord clamping.",

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic disorder in humans, but its incidence in monozygotic twins is extremely rare. The aim of this study was to determine the factors associated with dental caries in a pair of monozygotic twin girls with DS, where one had caries experience and the other did not. Clinical examination, salivary Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) levels and their genotypic diversity, the biochemical composition of the dental biofilm, the frequency of sucrose consumption, and toothbrushing habits were assessed from the twin girls. Twin with caries experience showed higher levels of S. mutans in the saliva and lower concentrations of calcium, phosphate, and fluoride and higher concentrations of extracellular polysaccharides in the biofilm compared to her sister. Genotypic diversity of S. mutans was also higher in the twin with caries experience. Dental biofilm composition showed different patterns of cariogenicity between the two sisters, which may also by itself explain the difference in the dental caries between them.",

    "abstract": "One salient characteristic of twin studies and the related behavioral genetics paradigm is the requirement of a large sample size. Countries or regions that are large in size and highly populated are at an advantage when implementing twin studies. However, given the fascinating and promising results obtained from twin studies, many researchers based in smaller countries or regions may still want to conduct twin studies in order to address local and theoretical issues. In this article, we have outlined the development of twin studies in Hong Kong, one of the Special Administrative Regions of China. The historical development and design of the two major twin studies of language and reading development implemented within Hong Kong are discussed, providing insights to researchers who also aspire to conduct twin studies in small regions.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of intrauterine environment on the magnitude of intrapair differences in six somatic traits of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins (1,263 pairs; 424 MZ twins and 839 DZ twins). Differences in intrauterine environments of MZ twins enforced division of the research material into four groups: (1) MZ-MC-TTTS - MZ twins from monochorionic (MC) pregnancies with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), (2) MZ-MC (without TTTS)-MZ twins from MC pregnancies without TTTS, (3) MZ-DC-MZ twins from dichorionic (DC) pregnancies, and (4) DZ-DZ twins. The intrapair differences in all analyzed somatic traits, especially body weight and circumference of the chest, were the largest in the case of MZ twins from MC pregnancies with TTTS. DZ twins were the group presenting with the second largest intrapair differences in the analyzed traits. At the end of pregnancy, that is, in lunar months 9 and 10, the magnitude of intrapair differences in all traits of twins from this group was significantly greater than in MZ twins from both MC and DC pregnancies. Irrespective of the analyzed period, the least evident, statistically insignificant intrapair differences in the studied traits were documented in the case of MZ twins from MC pregnancies without TTTS and twins from DC pregnancies. These findings imply that the differentiating effect of intrauterine environment is associated with the occurrence of TTTS, rather than with chorionicity, as postulated previously.",

So, too, has it affected the relationship I have with friends, family, my husband, myself. My reasons for becoming a student midwife were numerous, but my experiences as a pregnant woman and a new mother were pivotal in that decision. Whilst screening tools are commended to detect postnatal depression, depression does not fit a scoring system neatly, and is experienced differently by everyone. In addition, women suffering may falsify results (I did) and may not consent to use of the tools. Women's subjective experience of pregnancy, birth and motherhood is crucial, and PND needs to be spoken about in the antenatal period in order to overcome the associated stigma and to encourage women's self-efficacy in reporting symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The epigenetic clock, also known as DNA methylation age (DNAmAge), represents age-related changes of DNA methylation at multiple sites of the genome and is suggested to be a biomarker for biological age. Elevated blood DNAmAge is associated with all-cause mortality, with the strongest effects reported in a recent intrapair twin study where epigenetically older twins had increased mortality risk in comparison to their co-twins. In the study presented here, we hypothesize that DNAmAge in blood is associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive abilities in middle-aged individuals. In 486 monozygotic twins, we investigated the association of DNAmAge, difference between DNAmAge and chronological age and age acceleration with cognition. Despite using a powerful paired twin design, we found no evidence for association of blood DNAmAge with cognitive abilities. This observation was confirmed in unpaired analyses, where DNAmAge initially correlated with cognitive abilities, until adjusting for chronological age. Overall, our study shows that for middle-aged individuals DNAmAge calculated in blood does not correlate with cognitive abilities.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare, genetically determined error of metabolism. The characteristic clinical symptoms are diarrhea, juvenile cataracts, tendon xanthomas and neuropsychiatric alterations. The aim of this study is to present a pair of identical adult twins with considerable differences in the severity of phenotype. With regards to neuropsychiatric symptoms, the predominant features were severe Parkinsonism and moderate cognitive dysfunctions in the more-affected individual, whereas these alterations in the less-affected patient were only very mild and mild, respectively. The characteristic increase in the concentrations of serum cholestanol and the lesion volumes in dentate nuclei in the brain assessed with magnetic resonance imaging were quite similar in both cases. The lifestyle conditions, including eating habits of the twin pair, were quite similar as well; therefore, currently unknown genetic modifiers or certain epigenetic factors may be responsible for the differences in severity of phenotype. This case series serves as the first description of an identical twin pair with CTX presenting heterogeneous clinical features.",

    "abstract": "Increased cytokines and kynurenic acid (KYNA) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been reported in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The aim of the present study was to investigate cytokines and kynurenines in the CSF of twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and to study these CSF markers in relation to psychotic symptoms and personality traits. CSF levels of tryptophan (TRP), KYNA, quinolinic acid (QUIN), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were analyzed in 23 twins with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and in their not affected co-twins. Ratings of psychotic symptoms and personality traits were made using the Scales for Assessment of Negative and Positive symptoms, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV - Axis II Disorders, and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire - Brief. A total score for psychotic symptoms and personality traits was constructed for analysis. CSF KYNA was associated with the score for psychotic symptom and personality traits. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 were associated, and the intra-pair differences scores of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 were highly correlated. Intraclass correlations indicated genetic influences on CSF KYNA, TRP, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1. The association between KYNA and psychotic symptoms further supports a role of KYNA in psychotic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) is a rare neurodegenerative disease with early onset. PLA2G6 gene mutations have been identified in the majority individuals with INAD. In future, molecular diagnosis of INAD will replace the invasive biopsies used previously. In the present report, monozygotic male twins with INAD were referred The Children's Hospital (Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China) at fifteen months old for delayed development. The older brother was found to have developmental stagnation when he was 6 months old. The patient could not stand securely without support, and had poor eye tracking and listening ability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patient's brain revealed cerebellar atrophy and electromyography identified signs of peripheral neuropathy. The younger brother displayed similar clinical features and findings. Two different phospholipase A2 group VI (PLA2G6; 22q13.1) gene mutations were detected in the twins by DNA sequencing. The results of the present study indicate that neurogenetic disease should be considered when child patients present with idiopathic developmental stagnation, particularly when similar cases have appeared in the same family. In addition, INAD should be considered as a possible diagnosis when the patient has developmental delay of the central and peripheral nerves. In the future, molecular genetic testing will be the primary method of INAD diagnosis, enabling better prevention of this genetic disease.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies are powerful models to elucidate epigenetic modifications resulting from gene-environment interactions. Yet, commonly a limited number of clinical twin samples are available, leading to an underpowered situation afflicted with false positives and hampered by low sensitivity. We investigated genome-wide DNA methylation data from two small sets of monozygotic twins representing different phases during the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to find novel genes for further research.\nWe implemented a robust statistical methodology aimed at investigating a small number of samples to identify differential methylation utilizing the comprehensive CHARM platform with whole blood cell DNA from two sets of twin pairs discordant either for ACPA (antibodies to citrullinated protein antigens)-positive RA versus ACPA-negative healthy or for ACPA-positive healthy (a pre-RA stage) versus ACPA-negative healthy. To deconvolute cell type-dependent differential methylation, we assayed the methylation patterns of sorted cells and used computational algorithms to resolve the relative contributions of different cell types and used them as covariates.\nTo identify methylation biomarkers, five healthy twin pairs discordant for ACPAs were profiled, revealing a single differentially methylated region (DMR). Seven twin pairs discordant for ACPA-positive RA revealed six significant DMRs. After deconvolution of cell type proportions, profiling of the healthy ACPA discordant twin-set revealed 17 genome-wide significant DMRs. When methylation profiles of ACPA-positive RA twin pairs were adjusted for cell type, the analysis disclosed one significant DMR, associated with the EXOSC1 gene. Additionally, the results from our methodology suggest a temporal connection of the protocadherine beta-14 gene to ACPA-positivity with clinical RA.\nOur biostatistical methodology, optimized for a low-sample twin design, revealed non-genetically linked genes associated with two distinct phases of RA. Functional evidence is still lacking but the results reinforce further study of epigenetic modifications influencing the progression of RA. Our study design and methodology may prove generally useful in twin studies.",

Partially attributed to the development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the amygdala, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the precise genetic and experiential contributions remain unknown. In previous work, childhood basal cortisol function predicted adolescent resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) and psychopathology. To parse experience-driven (non-genetic) contributions, we investigated these relations with a monozygotic (MZ) twin design. Specifically, we examined whether intrapair differences in childhood afternoon cortisol levels predicted cotwin differences in adolescent brain function and coping.

    "abstract": "Host genetics is one of several factors known to shape human gut microbiome composition, however, the physiological processes underlying the heritability are largely unknown. Inter-individual differences in host factors secreted into the gut lumen may lead to variation in microbiome composition. One such factor is the ABO antigen. This molecule is not only expressed on the surface of red blood cells, but is also secreted from mucosal surfaces in individuals containing an intact FUT2 gene (secretors). Previous studies report differences in microbiome composition across ABO and secretor genotypes. However, due to methodological limitations, the specific bacterial taxa involved remain unknown.\nHere, we sought to determine the relationship of the microbiota to ABO blood group and secretor status in a large panel of 1503 individuals from a cohort of twins from the United Kingdom. Contrary to previous reports, robust associations between either ABO or secretor phenotypes and gut microbiome composition were not detected. Overall community structure, diversity, and the relative abundances of individual taxa were not significantly associated with ABO or secretor status. Additionally, joint-modeling approaches were unsuccessful in identifying combinations of taxa that were predictive of ABO or secretor status.\nDespite previous reports, the taxonomic composition of the microbiota does not appear to be strongly associated with ABO or secretor status in 1503 individuals from the United Kingdom. These results highlight the importance of replicating microbiome-associated traits in large, well-powered cohorts to ensure results are robust.",

    "abstract": "A 6.5-year-old clinically healthy German Shepherd Dog with regular oestrous cycles of 6\u00a0months was presented for pregnancy diagnosis on day 38 after ovulation (p.ov.). Ultrasonography revealed three individual placental sites in progressed resorption and two vital adequately developed foetuses sharing a joint placenta. On days 41 and 48\u00a0p.ov., sonographic signs indicated normal development of both foetuses, but on day 52\u00a0p.ov., both foetuses were found to be dead. A caesarean section was performed the same day. Examination of the removed uterus confirmed the diagnosis of a \"twin\" pregnancy with two foetuses sharing the same placental site but separate amniotic membranes. One foetus showed generalized oedema (anasarca). Bacterial culture of swabs taken from inside the placental cavity was negative. At histological examination of the uterus, no signs of inflammation were found. Serum relaxin concentrations (day 38, 41, 48 and 52.\u00a0p.ov.) were consistent with those of bitches with normal pregnancies. Cytogenetic analysis of the two foetuses revealed dizygotic twins, one male and one female according to SRY-PCR. By genotyping 17 high-polymorphic canine microsatellites, it could be demonstrated that the two foetuses developed from two different oocytes.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic variability among individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) has long been a challenge for clinicians and an enigma for researchers. Members of the same family and even identical twins with NF1 often demonstrate variable disease expression. Many mechanisms for this variability have been proposed. We have performed an exploratory study of copy number variants (CNVs) as a possible source of phenotypic variability in NF1. We enrolled 11 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins with NF1 and their parents, catalogued their clinical characteristics, and utilized a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray to identify CNVs in blood and saliva. The 11 twin pairs showed high concordance for presence and number of caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, cutaneous neurofibromas, IQ, and ADHD. They were more likely to be discordant for optic pathway glioma, plexiform neurofibromas, skeletal manifestations, and malignancy. Microarray analysis identified a total of 81 CNVs meeting our conservative criteria, 37 of which overlap known genes. Of interest, three CNVs were previously unreported. Microarray analysis failed to ascertain any CNV differences within twin pairs, between twins and parents, or between tissues in any one individual. Results of this small pilot study did not demonstrate any de novo CNV events in our MZ twin pairs, nor were de novo CNVs overrepresented in these individuals with NF1. A much larger sample size would be needed to form any conclusions about the role of CNVs in NF1 variable expressivity. Alternative explanations for discordant phenotypes include epigenetic changes, smaller genetic alterations, or environmental factors. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are age-related conditions that are increasing in prevalence, commonly coexist, and share clinical features. This review provides a practical update on the\u00a0epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of patients with concomitant HFpEF and AF. Epidemiological studies highlight the close and complex links between HFpEF and AF, the shared risk factors, the high\u00a0AF\u00a0occurrence in the natural history of HFpEF, and the independent contribution of each condition to poor outcomes. Diagnosis of HFpEF in the setting of AF is challenging because the symptoms overlap. AF is associated with changes in\u00a0echocardiographic parameters and circulating natriuretic peptides that confound HFpEF diagnosis. Symptomatic improvement with diuretic therapy supports the presence of HFpEF in patients with concomitant AF. Important knowledge gaps need to be addressed by a multidisciplinary and translational research approach to develop novel therapies that can improve prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Health-related behaviors are significant contributors to morbidity and mortality in the United States, yet evidence on the underlying causes of the vast within-population variation in behaviors is mixed. While many potential causes of health-related behaviors have been identified-such as schooling, genetics, and environments-little is known on how much of the variation across multiple behaviors is due to a common set of causes. We use three separate datasets on U.S. twins to investigate the degree to which multiple health-related behaviors correlate and can be explained by a common set of factors. We find that aside from smoking and drinking, most behaviors are not strongly correlated among individuals. Based on the results of both within-identical-twins regressions and multivariate behavioral genetics models, we find some evidence that schooling may be related to smoking but not to the covariation between multiple behaviors. Similarly, we find that a large fraction of the variance in each of the behaviors is consistent with genetic factors; however, we do not find strong evidence that a single common set of genes explains variation in multiple behaviors. We find, however, that a large portion of the correlation between smoking and heavy drinking is consistent with common, mostly childhood, environments. This suggests that the initiation and patterns of these two behaviors might arise from a common childhood origin. Research and policy to identify and modify this source may provide a strong way to reduce the population health burden of smoking and heavy drinking.",

    "abstract": "Family study can provide estimates of overall genetic influences on a particular trait because family relationships provide accurate measures of average genetic sharing. However, evidence of genetic contributions to skin phenotypes is limited, which may preclude genetic studies to identify genetic variants or to understand underlying molecular biology of skin traits. This study aimed to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to selected dermatologic phenotypes, that is, to melanin index, sebum secretion, and skin humidity level in a Korean twin-family cohort. We investigated more than 2,000 individuals from 486 families, including 388 monozygotic twin pairs and 82 dizygotic twin pairs. Variance component method was used to estimate genetic influences in terms of heritability. Heritability of skin melanin index, sebum secretion, and skin humidity (arm and cheek) were estimated to be 0.44 [95% CI 0.38-0.49], 0.21 [95% CI 0.16-0.26], 0.13 [95% CI 0.07-0.18], and 0.11 [95% CI 0.06-0.16] respectively, after adjusting for confounding factors. Our findings suggest that genetics play a major role on skin melanin index, but only mild roles on sebum secretion and humidity. Sebum secretion and skin humidity are controlled predominantly by environmental factors notably on shared environments among family members. We expect that our findings add insight to determinants of common dermatologic traits, and serve as a reference for biologic studies.",

    "abstract": "Peters anomaly is a rare developmental malformation involving the anterior segment of the eye, which culminates in amblyopia or congenital blindness. Multiple ocular and/or systemic malformations have been observed with this anomaly, and novel comorbidities continue to be reported.\nThe probands were monozygotic twin boys (twin I and twin II) born to consanguineous parents at 36 weeks of gestation. Coarse facial features and deep-seated eyes were noted at birth. At 6 months, ophthalmic examination revealed that both twins were unable to blink in response to light, or to fixate and follow a moving object. Both twins had prominent horizontal nystagmus. Slit-lamp examination demonstrated varying degrees of central leukoma (corneal opacity) associated with iridocorneal adhesion, which is characteristic of type I Peters anomaly. No cataractous changes were observed. Normal intraocular pressure and disorganized retina were observed. Pupillary abnormalities included bilaterally underdeveloped pupils and bilateral absence of pupils was noted. Ocular MRI showed bilateral microphthalmia and optic nerve hypoplasia, with a small optic chiasm in both twins. At this age, the diagnosis of Peters anomaly was made. At 16 months of age, both twins developed deep venous thrombosis and purpuric skin lesions. Investigations revealed a hereditary thrombophilia secondary to a homozygous mutation causing protein C deficiency, which is a rare thrombotic condition. Ocular ultrasonography revealed bilateral vitreous hemorrhaging linked to altered coagulation. One twin developed bilateral inguinal hernia and cryptorchidism.\nThe novel concordance of Peters anomaly in these monozygotic twins sharing a mutation in PROC gene provides further evidence that this anomaly has a genetic basis. Hypoplasia of the optic nerves and optic chiasm, along with severe protein C deficiency and bilateral absence of the pupils, are associated comorbidities that have not previously been reported with this anomaly.",

    "abstract": "This investigation examines the spread of problem behaviors (substance use and delinquency) between twin siblings. A sample of 628 twins (151 male twin pairs and 163 female twin pairs) drawn from the Quebec Newborn Twin Study completed inventories describing delinquency and substance use at ages 13, 14, and 15. A 3-wave longitudinal actor-partner interdependence model (APIM) identified avenues whereby problem behaviors spread from one twin to another. Problems did not spread directly between twins across domains. Instead, 2 indirect pathways were identified: (a) Problems first spread interindividually (between twins) within a behavioral domain, then spread intraindividually (within twins) across behavioral domains (e.g., Twin A delinquency \u2192 Twin B delinquency \u2192 Twin B substance use); and (b) problems first spread intraindividually (within twins) across behavioral domains, then spread interindividually (between twins) within a behavioral domain (e.g., Twin A delinquency \u2192 Twin A substance use \u2192 Twin B substance use). Controls for genetic effects, gene-environment correlations, friend substance use and delinquency, and parenting behaviors increase confidence in the conclusion that twin siblings uniquely contribute to the spread of problem behaviors during adolescence. Twin sibling influence is a risk factor for illicit substance use, both because substance use by one twin predicts substance use by the other twin, but also because delinquency in one twin predicts delinquency in the other twin, which then gives rise to greater substance use.

    "abstract": "Depression is a significant problem and it is vital to understand its underlying causes and related policy implications. Neighborhood characteristics are implicated in depression but the nature of this association is unclear. Unobserved or unmeasured factors may confound the relationship. This study addresses confounding in a twin study investigating neighborhood-level effects on depression controlling for genetics, common environment, and gene\u00d7environment (G \u00d7 E) interactions.\nData on neighborhood deprivation and depression were gathered from 3155 monozygotic twin pairs and 1275 dizygotic pairs (65.7% female) between 2006 and 2013. The variance for both depression and neighborhood deprivation was decomposed into three components: additive genetic variance (A); shared environmental variance (C); and non-shared environmental variance (E). Depression was then regressed on neighborhood deprivation to test the direct association and whether that association was confounded. We also tested for a G \u00d7 E interaction in which the heritability of depression was modified by the level of neighborhood deprivation.\nDepression and neighborhood deprivation showed evidence of significant A (21.8% and 15.9%, respectively) and C (13.9% and 32.7%, respectively) variance. Depression increased with increasing neighborhood deprivation across all twins (p = 0.009), but this regression was not significant after controlling for A and C variance common to both phenotypes (p = 0.615). The G \u00d7 E model showed genetic influences on depression increasing with increasing neighborhood deprivation (p < 0.001).\nNeighborhood deprivation is an important contributor to depression via increasing the genetic risk. Modifiable pathways that link neighborhoods to depression have been proposed and should serve as targets for intervention and research.",

    "methods": "Data on neighborhood deprivation and depression were gathered from 3155 monozygotic twin pairs and 1275 dizygotic pairs (65.7% female) between 2006 and 2013. The variance for both depression and neighborhood deprivation was decomposed into three components: additive genetic variance (A); shared environmental variance (C); and non-shared environmental variance (E). Depression was then regressed on neighborhood deprivation to test the direct association and whether that association was confounded. We also tested for a G \u00d7 E interaction in which the heritability of depression was modified by the level of neighborhood deprivation.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined the adequacy of a three-item parent questionnaire in determining the zygosity of young Chinese twins and whether there was any association between parent response accuracy and some demographic variables. The sample consisted of 334 pairs of same-sex Chinese twins aged from 3 to 11\u00a0years. Three scoring methods, namely the summed score, logistic regression, and decision tree, were employed to evaluate parent response accuracy of twin zygosity based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) information. The results showed that all three methods achieved high level of accuracy ranging from 91 to 93\u00a0% which was comparable to the accuracy rates in previous Chinese twin studies. Correlation results also showed that the higher the parents' education level or the family income was, the more likely parents were able to tell correctly that their twins are identical or fraternal. The present findings confirmed the validity of using a three-item parent questionnaire to determine twin zygosity in a Chinese school-aged twin sample.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota has been typically viewed as an environmental factor for human health. Twins are well suited for investigating the concordance of their gut microbiomes and decomposing genetic and environmental influences. However, existing twin studies utilizing metagenomic shotgun sequencing have included only a few samples. Here, we sequenced fecal samples from 250 adult twins in the TwinsUK registry and constructed a comprehensive gut microbial reference gene catalog. We demonstrate heritability of many microbial taxa and functional modules in the gut microbiome, including those associated with diseases. Moreover, we identified 8 million SNPs in the gut microbiome and observe a high similarity in microbiome SNPs between twins that slowly decreases after decades of living apart. The results shed new light on the genetic and environmental influences on the composition and function of the gut microbiome that could relate to risk of complex diseases.",

The prospective risk of fetal death was calculated as the total number of deaths at the beginning of the gestational period divided by the number of continuing pregnancies at or beyond that period. Data were compared to the 2006 previous report.\nNearly 80% of the neonates weighed <2500 g, including 13.5% who weighed <1500 g. Half were born at <36 weeks, including 13.8% who were born at <32 weeks. The data indicate an increased IUFD rate over time - 16 fetal deaths per pregnancy (3.1%) and 22 IUFDs per fetus (2.1%). The rate of IUFD after 32-33 weeks, however, was halved (1/187 pregnancies and 1/365 fetuses, 0.5 and 0.3%, respectively).\nIntensive prenatal surveillance might decrease the unexpected fetal death rates after 33 week's gestation and our data do not support elective preterm birth for uncomplicated MCBA twins.",

    "abstract": "This prospective cohort study evaluated the relationship between fertility treatments and the prevalence and outcomes of dichorionic discordant twins. This issue has gained importance due to twin gestations resulting from fertility treatments.\nMothers of dichorionic twin pregnancies achieved in a single fertility clinic by assisted reproduction techniques, who had completed the first trimester of the pregnancy, were prospectively enrolled. Pregnancies with major fetal anomalies were excluded. Data regarding concordant and discordant twins based on the fertility treatments given to achieve the pregnancies were analyzed to determine the prevalence of discordance and pregnancy outcomes.\nA total of 571 dichorionic twin pregnancies were available for evaluation. Fertility treatments modalities, sperm quality and implantation of cultured and thawed embryos did not influence the rate and severity of discordant twins. Increased hospitalization rates were found among discordant (n=108) compared to concordant (n=463) twins (47.2% vs. 31.3%, P<0.0001) and higher rates of betamethasone treatment (65.7% vs. 28.9%, P<0.0001). Secondary analysis of discordant pregnancies with a growth restricted twin, revealed the same results. We found no association between various fertility treatments and twin discordance.\nOur data suggest that fertility treatments do not play a major role in the pervasiveness and outcome of discordant twin pregnancies.",

Fertility treatments modalities, sperm quality and implantation of cultured and thawed embryos did not influence the rate and severity of discordant twins. Increased hospitalization rates were found among discordant (n=108) compared to concordant (n=463) twins (47.2% vs. 31.3%, P<0.0001) and higher rates of betamethasone treatment (65.7% vs. 28.9%, P<0.0001). Secondary analysis of discordant pregnancies with a growth restricted twin, revealed the same results. We found no association between various fertility treatments and twin discordance.",

    "abstract": "We compared the nature of the sibling relationship in dyads of varying genetic relatedness, employing a behavioural genetic design to estimate the contribution that genes and the environment have on this familial bond. Two samples were used-the Sisters and Brothers Study consisted of 173 families with two target non-twin children (mean ages\u00a0=\u00a07.42 and 5.22\u00a0years respectively); and the Twins, Family and Behaviour study included 234 families with two target twin children (mean age\u00a0=\u00a04.70\u00a0years). Mothers and fathers reported on their children's relationship with each other, via a postal questionnaire (the Sisters and Brothers Study) or a telephone interview (the Twins, Family and Behaviour study). Contrary to expectations, no mean level differences emerged when monozygotic twin pairs, dizygotic twin pairs, and non-twin pairs were compared on their sibling relationship quality. Behavioural genetic analyses also revealed that the sibling bond was modestly to moderately influenced by the genetic propensities of the children within the dyad, and moderately to substantially influenced by the shared environment common to both siblings. In addition, for sibling negativity, we found evidence of twin-specific environmental influence-dizygotic twins showed more reciprocity than did non-twins. Our findings have repercussions for the broader application of results from future twin-based investigations.",

    "abstract": "The language development of twins tends to lag behind in comparison to that of singletons. The purpose of this study was to compare expressive and receptive language skills of 3- to 12-year-old twins with singletons. Secondly, correlations between language differences between twins and singletons and age were investigated.\nTwenty-four twins with a mean age of 5.1 years participated in the study. The control group consisted of 24 singletons who were matched for gender and age. Language development was investigated using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals.\nTwins scored significantly lower for expressive and receptive language skills compared to singletons. Even when excluding preterm-born children, twins still scored significantly lower for expressive language skills. There was no correlation between age and language differences between twins and their matched singletons.\nTwins score lower for expressive and receptive language skills compared to singletons, and preterm birth cannot be regarded as the main cause for the language delay. The language delay in twins is rather mild but does not seem to decrease with increasing age.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare medical phenomenon that offers a unique challenge for medical professionals. The complex anatomy of conjoined twins dictates their survival and amenability to separation, making each case different in terms of medical management, surgical planning, and patient outcomes. Thoraco-omphalo-ischiopagus twins, joined from the thorax to the pelvis, are one of the rarest orientations recorded in the medical literature, and successful separation of this subset of conjoined twins has not been documented. This report presents a novel case of thoraco-omphalo-ischiopagus tetrapus twins who were successfully separated at 10 months of age. The preoperative planning, operative details, and postoperative course are discussed as they relate to the reconstructive effort.\nThree-dimensional medical modeling was pursued early in the planning process and was used to estimate the soft-tissue requirements for reconstruction and to design custom tissue expanders.\nThe reconstructive effort required postponement until respiratory status was optimized. Even with elaborate preoperative planning, primary closure of the abdomen was limited because of tissue edema and other less predictable patient factors. Delayed closure of the abdominal wall was made possible with negative-pressure wound therapy and secondary flap advancements.\nPreoperative coordination with necessary vendors, a multidisciplinary surgical effort, and optimal timing of the surgical intervention all contribute to the successful separation and long-term survival of thoraco-omphalo-ischiopagus conjoined twins.\nTherapeutic, V.",

    "abstract": "The type of cord insertion within monochorionic twin pairs could be different. The purpose of study is to evaluate the association of different combinations of placental umbilical cord insertions with birth weight discordance in a large cohort of monochorionic twins.\nAll consecutive monochorionic placentas from either uncomplicated twin pregnancies or with fetal weight discordance examined and injected with color dye at our centers were included in this study (n\u00a0=\u00a0374). Marginal or velamentous cord insertions were defined as abnormal. Placentas were categorized as concordant when the cord insertions of both fetuses were either normal-normal or abnormal-abnormal, and as discordant when they were normal-abnormal. Birth weight discordance was defined as a difference in birth weight of each twin \u226525%. The association of different cord insertion combinations with birth weight discordance was analyzed.\nThe rate of discordant cord insertions was 55% (204/374) in monochorionic twins. A highly significant association between discordant cord insertions and discordant birth weight was observed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The odds ratios (OR) for birth weight discordance in the discordant cord insertion group compared with the concordant group were 2.3 (95% CI: 1.2-4.4) for the normal-marginal and 5.9 (95% CI: 3.8-10.4) for the normal-velamentous cord insertion subgroup. Discordant cord insertions are associated with the occurrence of unequal placental sharing (OR 4.3, 95%CI 2.7-6.9).\nDiscordance of cord insertions is associated with discordance of birth weight and may therefore be an important indicator of adverse outcome in monochorionic twins.",

Compared with singleton pregnancies, overall perinatal risk of death is higher in twin pregnancies; however, for the preterm period, the perinatal mortality rate has been reported to be lower in twins.\nThe purpose of this study was to compare perinatal mortality rates in relation to gestational age at birth between singleton and twin pregnancies, taking into account socioeconomic status, fetal sex, and parity.\nWe studied perinatal mortality rates according to gestational age at birth in 1,502,120 singletons pregnancies and 51,658 twin pregnancies without congenital malformations who were delivered between 2002 and 2010 after 28 weeks of gestation. Data were collected from the nationwide Netherlands Perinatal Registry.\nOverall the perinatal mortality rate in twin pregnancies (6.6/1000 infants) was higher than in singleton pregnancies (4.1/1000 infants). However, in the preterm period, the perinatal mortality rate in twin pregnancies was substantially lower than in singleton pregnancies (10.4 per 1000 infants as compared with 34.5 per 1000 infants, respectively) for infants who were born at <37 weeks of gestation; this held especially for antepartum deaths. After 39 weeks of gestation, the perinatal mortality rate was higher in twin pregnancies. Differences in parity, fetal sex, and socioeconomic status did not explain the observed differences in outcome.\nOverall the perinatal mortality rate was higher in twin pregnancies than in singleton pregnancies, which is most likely caused by the high preterm birth rate in twins and not by a higher mortality rate for gestation, apart from term pregnancies. During the preterm period, the antepartum mortality rate was much lower in twin pregnancies than in singleton pregnancies. We suggest that this might be partially due to a closer monitoring of twin pregnancies, which indirectly suggests a need for closer surveillance of singleton pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Identical twin brothers developed mild encephalopathy at the age of 7.0 and 9.7 years (Patient 1) and 10.7 years (Patient 2). Patient 1 had influenza A at the time of his second episode, but triggering agents were not evident at the first episode. The triggering agents in Patient 2 were unclear. The neurological features of both patients included transient facial numbness, left arm paresis, dysarthria, and gait disturbance. Diffusion-weighted images from magnetic resonance imaging showed high signal levels at the splenium of corpus callosum and in the bilateral cerebral deep white matter. These results are characteristic of mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible isolated splenium of corpus callosum lesion. All three episodes were treated with a methylprednisolone pulse. Acyclovir was also administered to Patient 2 and to Patient 1 during his first episode. Patient 1 received an anti-influenza agent and intravenous immunoglobulin during his second episode. Both patients recovered completely without sequelae. Genetic factors, which may predispose identical twins to develop encephalopathy, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "To investigate maternal serum inhibin as a marker of pre-eclampsia (PE) in twins.\nOne hundred forty-three twins and 109 unaffected singleton pregnancies were recruited in the first trimester from the same institution. Blood samples were stored at recruitment and in the second trimester, retrospectively tested for inhibin and values expressed in multiples of the gestation-specific median (MoMs) in singletons, adjusted for maternal weight, as appropriate.\nThe median inhibin level in unaffected twins was 2.04 MoM compared with 1.00 MoM in singletons (P\u2009<\u20090.0001, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, one-tailed). Excluding early fetal losses the median in 22 samples from 12 twins with PE was 2.65 MoM compared with 1.99 MoM in 201 samples from 120 unaffected twins (P\u2009<\u20090.02, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test). This effect was restricted to second trimester samples with medians in cases and controls of 2.86 and 1.91 MoM respectively. Logistic regression of inhibin A together with established PE marker placental growth factor and placental associated plasma protein showed that in the second trimester, it improved screening performance although not reaching statistical significance (P\u2009=\u20090.08).\nInhibin A is a potential second trimester marker of PE in twins. It may improve on existing twin screening protocols but more data are required. \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "A limited body of research is available on the relationships between multiplicity of birth and neuropsychological functioning in preterm children who were conceived in the age of assisted reproductive technology and served by the modern neonatal intensive care unit. Our chief objective was to evaluate whether, after adjustment for sociodemographic factors and perinatal complications, twin birth accounted for a unique portion of developmental outcome variance in children born at-risk in the surfactant era.\nWe compared the neuropsychological functioning of 77 twins and 144 singletons born preterm (<34 gestational weeks) and served by William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI. Children were evaluated at preschool age, using standardized tests of memory, language, perceptual, and motor abilities.\nMultiple regression analyses, adjusting for sociodemographic and perinatal variables, revealed no differences on memory or motor indices between preterm twins and their singleton counterparts. In contrast, performance of language and visual processing tasks was significantly lower in twins despite reduced perinatal risk in comparison to singletons. Effect sizes ranged from .33 to .38 standard deviations for global language and visual processing ability indices, respectively. No significant group by sex interactions were observed, and comparison of first-, or second-born twins with singletons yielded medium effect sizes (Cohen's d=.56 and .40, respectively).\nThe modest twin disadvantage on language and visual processing tasks at preschool-age could not be readily attributable to socioeconomic or perinatal variables. The possibility of biological or social twinning-related phenomena as mechanisms underlying the observed performance gaps are discussed. (JINS, 2016, 22, 865-877).",

    "abstract": "We describe Caucasian monozygotic twin brothers with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and discuss influence of predictors to methotrexate (MTX) outcome treatment. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the MTX metabolic pathways were genotyped. Twins have multiple mutations: a CC mutation of SNP 1298A>C in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, CC mutations of three SNPs in the adenosine receptor gene ADORA2A (rs3761422_4217241T>C, rs2267076_4221164T>C, rs2236624_4226593T>C), and a heterozygous genotype in SNPs ATIC_rs2372536_347C>G, MTHFD1_rs2236225_1958G>A. These mutations are known to predict a worse outcome of MTX treatment. The twins had different lifestyles (alcohol drinking and smoking in Twin 1, regular coffee consumption in Twin 2), but a very similar clinical presentation of the outset of RA, radiographic scoring according to the Sharp/van der Heijde method with an almost identical antibodies presentation. The period of the patients before anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment was characterized by unsuccessful per oral MTX pharmacotherapy in both cases (a low effect of MTX in Twin 1; an early discontinuation of MTX due to an adverse event in Twin 2). In both twins, the outcome of well-controlled anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment (co-medication with MTX in Twin 1) for 10 years was expressed as low disease activity measured using composite index DAS28. It is interesting that Twin 2 had an unfavorable radiographic scoring after a 10-year follow-up than Twin 1 in spite of the comparable DAS28 in Twin 2 and smoking in Twin 1. In conclusion, co-medication of MTX with biologics may impact on RA radiographic progression despite predicted bad MTX outcome based on pharmacogenetic analysis.",

    "abstract": "Using Swedish nationwide registry data, the authors investigated the correlation of genetic and environmental risk factors in the etiology of drug abuse as ascertained from medical and criminal registries by modeling twin and sibling data. Medical drug abuse was defined using public inpatient and outpatient records, while criminal drug abuse was ascertained through legal records. Twin, full and half sibling pairs were obtained from the national twin and genealogical registers. Information about sibling pair residence within the same household was obtained from Statistics Sweden. Standard bivariate genetic structural equation modeling was applied to the population-based data on drug abuse ascertained through medical and crime registries, using OpenMx. Analyses of all possible pairs of twins (MZ: N\u00a0=\u00a04482; DZ: N\u00a0=\u00a09838 pairs), full-\u00a0(N\u00a0=\u00a01,278,086) and half-siblings (paternal: N\u00a0=\u00a07767; maternal N\u00a0=\u00a070,553) who grew up together suggested that factors explaining familial resemblance for drug abuse as defined through medical or criminal registries were mostly the same. Results showed substantial heritability and moderate contributions of shared environmental factors to drug abuse; both were higher in males versus females, and higher for drug abuse ascertained through criminal than medical records. Because of the low prevalence of both assessments of drug abuse, having access to population data was crucial to obtain stable estimates. Using objective registry data, the authors found that drug abuse-whether ascertained through medical versus criminal records-was highly heritable. Furthermore, shared environmental factors contributed significantly to the liability of drug abuse. Genetic and shared environmental risk factors for these two forms of drug abuse were highly correlated.",

    "abstract": "Parental perception of zygosity might bias heritability estimates derived from parent rated twin data. This is the first study to examine if similarities in parental reports of their young twins' behavior were biased by beliefs about their zygosity. Data were from Gemini, a British birth cohort of 2402 twins born in 2007. Zygosity was assessed twice, using both DNA and a validated parent report questionnaire at 8 (SD\u00a0=\u00a02.1) and 29\u00a0months (SD\u00a0=\u00a03.3). 220/731 (8\u00a0months) and 119/453 (29\u00a0months) monozygotic (MZ) pairs were misclassified as dizygotic (DZ) by parents; whereas only 6/797 (8\u00a0months) and 2/445 (29\u00a0months) DZ pairs were misclassified as MZ. Intraclass correlations for parent reported eating behaviors (four measured at 8\u00a0months; five at 16\u00a0months) were of the same magnitude for correctly classified and misclassified MZ pairs, suggesting that parental zygosity perception does not influence reporting on eating behaviors of their young twins.",

Intertwin discordances at the time of nuchal translucency (NT) screening may have a value in the prediction of fetal loss or twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. We aimed to determine the ability of intertwin NT and crown rump length (CRL) discordances among MCDA twins to predict adverse outcomes.\nAll MCDA twins with a documented routine ultrasound at 11 to 13+6 weeks' gestation, and known pregnancy outcome between August 2003 and August 2012 were included. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the ideal NT and CRL discordances cut-off points that maximized the ability to predict adverse outcome, which was defined as any of: death of one or both twins, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, or estimated fetal weight or birth weight discordances \u226525%.\nOf the 89 cases, 20 (22.5%) had at least one adverse outcome. NT discordance was more discriminatory of adverse outcome than was CRL discordance. The optimal values for predicting any adverse outcomes for NT were >23.7% and for CRL >3.5%. The positive predictive values for NT (52.4%) and CRL (29.8%) screening were relatively low; however, the lack of either NT or CRL discordances was more reassuring, with negative predictive values of 86.8% and 86.4%, respectively.\nNT discordance is more predictive for adverse fetal outcome in MCDA twins than CRL discordance. Neither NT nor CRL discordance are likely to modify the intensive monitoring required for these very high-risk pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Verbal and physical aggression begin early in life and steadily decline thereafter in normal development. As a result, elevated aggressive behavior in adolescence may signal atypical development and greater vulnerability for negative mental and health outcomes. Converging evidence suggests that brain disturbances in regions involved in impulse control, emotional regulation, and sensation seeking may contribute to heightened aggression. However, little is known regarding the neural mechanisms underlying subtypes of aggression (i.e., proactive and reactive aggression) and whether they differ between males and females. Using a sample of 106 14-year-old adolescent twins, this study found that striatal enlargement was associated with both proactive and reactive aggression. We also found that volumetric alterations in several frontal regions including smaller middle frontal and larger orbitofrontal cortex were correlated with higher levels of aggression in adolescent twins. In addition, cortical thickness analysis showed that thickness alterations in many overlapping regions including middle frontal, superior frontal, and anterior cingulate cortex and temporal regions were associated with aggression in adolescent twins. Results support the involvement of fronto-limbic-striatal circuit in the etiology of aggression during adolescence. Aggr. Behav. 43:230-240, 2017. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins were previously regarded as \"identical\". By now an increasing number of case reports of monozygotic but discordant twins have been reported, and therefore discordance between monozygotic twins is being investigated intensively. We report a case of female preterm monozygotic twins who were discordant for fetal megacystis due to cloacal dysgenesis. Pregnancy was achieved after intracytoplasmatic sperm injection and transfer of 2 embryos. By the first trimester fetal megacystis with consecutive oligohydramnios and hypoplasia of the lungs was diagnosed. Both foetuses had normal karyotypes. After delivery at 25+3 weeks of gestation due to premature labour, the affected child was treated palliatively and died within 2 hours. In the postmortem physical examination, a cloacal dysgenesis was detected. In the male foetus, megacystis is typically caused by obstructive uropathy. In the rarely affected female foetus, it usually results from complex urogenital malformations like cloacal dysgenesis which originates from disruption during gastrulation. We identified 10 case series of mono- or dizygotic twins who were discordant either for fetal megacystis or for cloacal dysgenesis. Issues like conception, zygosity, sex, karyotype and aetiology of fetal megacystis were not reported in all cases. Discordance between monozygotic twins for structural birth defects is closely linked to the twinning process itself. Assisted reproduction is said to generate a higher rate of monozygotic twin pregnancies and to be responsible for a higher prevalence of chromosomal aberrations or congenital malformations. With regard to conception, zygosity, sex, karyotype and combination of malformations, our case is unique.",

    "abstract": "Associations between long-term physical activity and cortical function and brain structure are poorly known. Our aim was to assess whether brain functional and/or structural modulation associated with long-term physical activity is detectable using a discordant monozygotic male twin pair design. Nine monozygotic male twin pairs were carefully selected for an intrapair difference in their leisure-time physical activity of at least three years duration (mean age 34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0years). We registered somatosensory mismatch response (SMMR) in EEG to electrical stimulation of fingers and whole brain MR images. We obtained exercise history and measured physical fitness and body composition. Equivalent electrical dipole sources of SMMR as well as gray matter (GM) voxel counts in regions of interest indicated by source analysis were evaluated. SMMR dipolar source strengths differed between active and inactive twins within twin pairs in postcentral gyrus, medial frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus and in anterior cingulate (AC) GM voxel counts differed similarly. Compared to active twins, their inactive twin brothers showed greater dipole strengths in short periods of the deviant-elicited SMMR and larger AC GM voxel counts. Stronger activation in early unattended cortical processing of the deviant sensory signals in inactive co-twins may imply less effective gating of somatosensory information in inactive twins compared to their active brothers. Present findings indicate that already in 30's long-term physical activity pattern is linked with specific brain indices, both in functional and structural domains.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is commonly investigated as a potential risk factor for low back pain (LBP); however, current evidence remains unclear. Limitations in previous studies may explain the inconsistent results in the field, such as the use of a cross sectional design, limitations in the measures used to assess obesity (eg, body mass index-BMI), and poor adjustment for confounders (eg, genetics and physical activity).\nTo better understand the effects of obesity on LBP, our aim was to investigate in a prospective cohort whether obesity-related measures increase the risk of chronic LBP outcomes using a longitudinal design. We assessed obesity through measures that consider the magnitude as well as the distribution of body fat mass. A within-pair twin case-control analysis was used to control for the possible effects of genetic and early shared environmental factors on the obesity-LBP relationship.\nData were obtained from the Murcia Twin Registry in Spain. Participants were 1,098 twins, aged 43 to 71 years, who did not report chronic LBP at baseline. Follow-up data on chronic LBP (>6 months), activity-limiting LBP, and care-seeking for LBP were collected after 2 to 4 years.\nThe risk factors were BMI, percentage of fat mass, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio.\nSequential analyses were performed using logistic regression controlling for familial confounding: (1) total sample analysis (twins analyzed as independent individuals); (2) within-pair twin case-control analyses (all complete twin pairs discordant for LBP at follow-up); and within-pair twin case-control analyses separated for (3) dizygotic and (4) monozygotic twins.\nNo increase in the risk of chronic LBP was found for any of the obesity-related measures: BMI (men/women, odds ratio [OR]: 0.99; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.86-1.14), % fat mass (women, OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.66-1.14), waist circumference (women, OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.74-1.30), and waist-to-hip ratio (women, OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.81-1.36). Similar results were found for activity-limiting LBP and care-seeking due to LBP. After the adjustment for genetics and early environmental factors shared by twins, the non-significant results remained unchanged.\nAfter 2 to 4 years, obesity-related measures did not increase the risk of developing chronic LBP or care-seeking for LBP with or without adjustment for familial factors such as genetics in Spanish adults.",

    "abstract": "Compared to families with IVF singletons, what are parental depressive, parent-adolescent interaction and adolescent adjustment outcomes in families with 11-17-year-old IVF twins?\nNo differences were detected for any measured outcome between families with 11-17-year-old IVF twins and those with IVF singletons, despite high statistical power.\nWhen IVF twins are younger than 5-years-old, parents tend to have more mental health difficulties and poorer parent-child interactions relative to IVF singletons. By middle childhood, these differences may no longer exist and available studies with middle childhood-aged IVF twins challenge the expected long-term implications of the early concerns. IVF twins may even have more optimum adjustment than IVF singletons in middle childhood.\nStudy of 280, 11-17-year-old IVF children (n\u00a0=\u00a0122 twins and n\u00a0=\u00a0158 singletons) from 195 families at a US reproductive endocrinology clinic.\nAt Wave 1, clinic patients with an IVF child born between 1998 and 2004 were invited to participate in an online survey. In this follow-up study, mothers and fathers provided information on each of their 11-17-year-old IVF adolescents.\nThere were no differences between 11- and 17-year-old IVF twins and IVF singletons in parent depressive symptoms, parent-adolescent interactions or adolescent adjustment outcomes.\nAlthough the family demographics are representative of\u00a0IVF patients, participants were drawn from one US clinic.\nStudy results provide reassurance that by adolescence IVF twins and their families function as well as IVF singletons and their families.\nUniversity of Minnesota (UMN) Agriculture Experiment Station (MN-52-107), UMN Grant-in-Aid of Research, Artistry and Scholarship, UMN College of Education and Human Development Research Development Investment Grant, UMN Women's Philosophic Leadership Circle Award, UMN Eva Miller Endowed Fellowship.

We observed no significant difference globally between the two groups for outcomes, except for the mean duration of postpartum hospitalization, which was significantly longer among the older women (mean \u00b1 SD, 9.5 \u00b1 7.4\u00a0days vs. 6.8 \u00b1 4.4\u00a0days). The rates of isolated pregnancy-related hypertension and of fetal growth restriction in singleton pregnancies were statistically higher in the older than in the younger group (19.2% vs. 5.5%, and 30.7% vs. 14.3%, respectively). Complication rates with twin pregnancies were similar between groups and very high compared with singleton pregnancies.\nComplication rates were similar among women aged 50\u00a0years and older and those aged 45-49\u00a0years. Nonetheless, given the high rate of complication in both groups, especially among twin pregnancies, single embryo transfer needs to be encouraged for oocyte donations after age 45\u00a0years.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of BMI on late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) of the coronary artery wall in identical monozygous twins discordant for BMI. Coronary LGE represents a useful parameter for the detection and quantification of atherosclerotic coronary vessel wall disease.\nThirteen monozygote female twin pairs (n\u2009=\u200926) with significantly different BMIs (>1.6\u00a0kg/m2) were recruited out of >10,000 twin pairs (TwinsUK Registry). A coronary 3D-T2prep-TFE MR angiogram and 3D-IR-TFE vessel wall scan were performed prior to and following the administration of 0.2\u00a0mmol/kg of Gd-DTPA on a 1.5\u00a0T MR scanner. The number of enhancing coronary segments and contrast to noise ratios (CNRs) of the coronary wall were quantified.\nAn increase in BMI was associated with an increased number of enhancing coronary segments (5.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 vs. 3.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and increased coronary wall enhancement (6.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 vs. 4.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9, p\u2009=\u20090.0027) compared to matched twins with lower BMI.\nThis study in monozygous twins indicates that acquired factors predisposing to obesity, including lifestyle and environmental factors, result in increased LGE of the coronary arteries, potentially reflecting an increase in coronary atherosclerosis in this female study population.\n\u2022 BMI-discordant twins allow the investigation of the influence of lifestyle factors independent from genetic confounders. \u2022 Only thirteen obesity-discordant twins were identified underlining the strong genetic component of BMI. \u2022 In female twins, a BMI increase is associated with increased coronary late gadolinium enhancement. \u2022 Increased late gadolinium enhancement in the coronary vessel wall potentially reflects increased atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disruption and shift work have been associated with cancer risk, but epidemiologic evidence for prostate cancer remains limited. We aimed to prospectively investigate the association between midlife sleep- and circadian-related parameters and later prostate cancer risk and mortality in a population-based cohort of Finnish twins.\nData were drawn from the Older Finnish Twin Cohort and included 11,370 twins followed from 1981 to 2012. Over the study period, 602 incident cases of prostate cancer and 110 deaths from prostate cancer occurred. Cox regression was used to evaluate associations between midlife sleep duration, sleep quality, chronotype, and shift work with prostate cancer risk and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Within-pair co-twin analyses were employed to account for potential familial confounding.\nCompared to \"definite morning\" types, \"somewhat evening\" types had a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer (HR 1.3; 95\u00a0% CI 1.1, 1.6). Chronotype significantly modified the relationship between shift work and prostate cancer risk (p-interaction <0.001). We found no significant association between sleep duration, sleep quality, or shift work and prostate cancer risk in the overall analyses and no significant association between any sleep- or circadian-related parameter and risk in co-twin analyses. Neither sleep- nor circadian-related parameters were significantly associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality.\nThe association between sleep disruption, chronotype, and shift work with prostate cancer risk and mortality has never before been studied in a prospective study of male twins. Our findings suggest that chronotype may be associated with prostate cancer risk and modify the association between shift work and prostate cancer risk. Future studies of circadian disruption and prostate cancer should account for this individual-level characteristic.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) present with profound fatigue, flu-like symptoms, pain, cognitive impairment, orthostatic intolerance, and post-exertional malaise (PEM), and exacerbation of some or all of the baseline symptoms. CASE REPORT We report on a pair of 34-year-old monozygotic twins discordant for ME/CFS, with WELL, the non-affected twin, and ILL, the affected twin. Both twins performed a two-day cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), pre- and post-exercise blood samples were drawn, and both provided stool samples for biochemical and molecular analysis. At peak exertion for both CPETs, ILL presented lower VO2peak and peak workload compared to WELL. WELL demonstrated normal reproducibility of VO2@ventilatory/anaerobic threshold (VAT) during \u00a0CPET2, whereas ILL experienced an abnormal reduction of 13% in VAT during \u00a0CPET2. A normal rise in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, creatinine, and ferritin content was observed following exercise for both WELL and ILL at each CPET. ILL showed higher increases of resistin, soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) after exercise compared to WELL. The gut bacterial microbiome and virome were examined and revealed a lower microbial diversity in ILL compared to WELL, with fewer beneficial bacteria such as Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium, and an expansion of bacteriophages belonging to the tailed dsDNA Caudovirales order.\u00a0 CONCLUSIONS Results suggest dysfunctional immune activation in ILL following exercise and that prokaryotic viruses may contribute to mucosal inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis. Therefore, a two-day CPET and molecular analysis of blood and microbiomes could provide valuable information about ME/CFS, particularly if applied to a larger cohort of monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Our study examines the contribution of genetic and environmental factors (both shared and unique) to frailty, measured using the Rockwood Frailty Index (FI) in a sample of twins from the St Thomas' UK Adult Twin Registry. The FI was based on 39 items of potential health deficit. Study participants were 3,375 volunteer adult twins (840 monozygotic and 802 dizygotic twin-pairs) 40.0-84.5 years old. First, we used structural equation modeling to estimate the relative contribution of genetics and of the shared and unique environment to variance in FI adjusted for age. In a second analysis, multiple linear regression was used to examine variance in FI as a function of father's occupational class (a component of shared environment and a measure of childhood socioeconomic status [SES]), adjusting for age, birth weight, marital status, and health behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity). Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS\u00ae Version 22 software and Mx open source software. Findings showed that 45% (95% confidence intervals [CIs] 30-53%) of the inter-individual variation in FI was heritable and 52% (95% CIs 47-57%) was due to the individual's unique environment. Multiple linear regression also showed a small but statistically significant inverse association between father's occupational class and FI, mediated by one's own educational attainment and birth weight. Our results indicate that frailty is both genetically and environmentally determined. Thus, its prevention and management call for a multifaceted approach that includes addressing deleterious environmental factors, some of which, like childhood SES, may act across the life course.",

    "abstract": "Increased medically assisted reproduction (MAR) use to treat infertility has resulted in a growing twin birth rate. Little is known about parent-child relationships for twin relative to singleton children in middle childhood. This study fills this gap by examining parent-child relationships in 57 families with eighty 6- to 12-year-old MAR twin and singleton children using observational data (warm and supportive communication, control, and hostility). Nested ANCOVAs indicate that while mothers exhibit similar interactional behaviors toward twins and singletons, fathers have less optimum behaviors toward twins relative to singletons. Twins displayed less engaged behavior with mothers and fathers relative to singletons. Given the vitality of parent-child relationships for family and child adjustment, future studies should examine determinants and outcomes of twin-singleton relationship differences to bolster twins' and their families' functioning.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have elucidated the genetics of Parkinson's disease; however, the aetiology of the majority of sporadic cases has not yet been resolved. We hypothesized that epigenetic variations could be associated with PD and evaluated the DNA methylation pattern in PD patients compared to brothers or twins without PD. The methylation of DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 62 discordant siblings including 24 monozygotic twins was characterized with Illumina DNA Methylation 450K bead arrays and subsequently validated in two independent cohorts: 221 PD vs. 227 healthy individuals (cohort 1) applying Illumina's VeraCode and 472 PD patients vs. 487 controls (cohort 2) using pyrosequencing. We choose a delta beta of >15\u00a0% and selected 62 differentially methylated CpGs in 51 genes from the discordant siblings. Among them, three displayed multiple CpGs per gene: microRNA 886 (MIR886, 10 CpGs), phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D, 2 CpGs) and tripartite motif-containing 34 (TRIM34, 2 CpGs). PDE4D was confirmed in both cohorts (p value 2.44e-05). In addition, for biomarker construction, we used the penalized logistic regression model, resulting in a signature of eight CpGs with an AUC of 0.77. Our findings suggest that a distinct level of PD susceptibility stems from individual, epigenetic modifications of specific genes. We identified a signature of CpGs in blood cells that could separate control from disease with a reasonable discriminatory power, holding promise for future epigenetically based biomarker development.",

    "abstract": "Alterations to cognitive function are often reported with depression and anxiety symptoms, yet few studies have examined the same associations with mental well-being. This study examined the association between mental well-being, depression and anxiety symptoms and cognitive function in 1502 healthy adult monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, and the shared/unique contribution of genetic (G) and environmental (E) variance. Using linear mixed models, mental well-being was positively associated (p\u2009<\u2009.01) with sustained attention (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.127), inhibition (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.096), cognitive flexibility (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.149), motor coordination (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.114) and working memory (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.156), whereas depression and anxiety symptoms were associated (p\u2009<\u2009.01) with poorer sustained attention (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.134), inhibition (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.139), cognitive flexibility (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.116) and executive function (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.139). Bivariate twin modelling showed well-being shared a small environmental correlation with motor coordination and a small genetic correlation with working memory. Trivariate twin modelling showed well-being shared a small genetic correlation with inhibition, whereas depression and anxiety symptoms shared a small environmental correlation with inhibition. The remaining variance was mostly driven by unique G and/or E variance. Overall, well-being and depression and anxiety symptoms show both independent and shared relationships with cognitive functions but this is largely attributable to unique G or E variance and small shared G/E variance between pairs of variables.",

    "abstract": "There is limited research on the genetic and environmental bases of psychopathic personality traits in children. In this study, psychopathic personality traits were assessed in a total of 1189 5-year-old boys and girls drawn from the Preschool Twin Study in Sweden. Psychopathic personality traits were assessed with the Child Problematic Traits Inventory, a teacher-report measure of psychopathic personality traits in children ranging from 3 to 12\u00a0years old. Univariate results showed that genetic influences accounted for 57, 25, and 74\u00a0% of the variance in the grandiose-deceitful, callous-unemotional, and impulsive-need for stimulation dimensions, while the shared environment accounted for 17, 48 and 9\u00a0% (n.s.) in grandiose-deceitful and callous-unemotional, impulsive-need for stimulation dimensions, respectively. No sex differences were found in the genetic and environmental variance components. The non-shared environment accounted for the remaining 26, 27 and 17\u00a0% of the variance, respectively. The three dimensions of psychopathic personality were moderately correlated (0.54-0.66) and these correlations were primarily mediated by genetic and shared environmental factors. In contrast to research conducted with adolescent and adult twins, we found that both genetic and shared environmental factors influenced psychopathic personality traits in early childhood. These findings indicate that etiological models of psychopathic personality traits would benefit by taking developmental stages and processes into consideration.",

    "abstract": "Acral pseudolymphomatous angiokeratoma of children (APACHE) is a condition that was first described in 1990 in a group of children, but has since been described in adults. We present the cases of identical twin patients aged 40\u00a0years. The first brother presented with an 8-year history of itchy lesions over the left ankle and the insteps of both feet. After a diagnostic biopsy, he was treated with potent steroids under occlusion for 8\u00a0weeks, which resulted in flattening of the lesions and resolution of the pruritus. The second twin had a 20-year history of a very similar presentation but the lesions were less pronounced; he chose not to have treatment. No other family members were affected. Skin biopsies from both patients showed similar changes. Within an overall hyperkeratotic and acanthotic epidermis, there were focal areas of lichenoid change and epidermal thinning. Beneath these areas, there was oedema and nodular aggregates of dense inflammatory cell infiltrate, predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate. APACHE has not been previously described in twins.",

    "abstract": "Keratocystic Odontogenic Tumour (KCOT) is unicystic or multicystic intraosseous benign tumour of odontogenic origin that recurs due to locally destructive behaviour. KCOTs are usually the first manifestation of Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS), an autosomal dominant disorder also known as Gorlin's syndrome and they are most frequently observed familial symptom regardless of patients' nationality. In addition, the recurrence rate and multiplicity of KCOTs is relatively high as compared to that of other sporadic carcinomas. KCOT has been considered as a non-hereditary lesion and its familial onset is an extremely rare event in non-NBCCS cases. Here, we describe previously unreported non-syndromic multiple KCOT cases in identical twins in a Japanese family. The subjects were female Japanese identical twins who were 26 and 27 years old, respectively, at the time of diagnosis for KCOT. They had no major or minor features of NBCCS other than KCOT. Although there were lesions that were likely to be dentigerous cysts based on radiographic findings, one of them was KCOT. This case report highlights the importance of precise diagnosis, choice of surgical method and careful observation for multiplicity or familial onset in sporadic KCOT cases without NBCCS.",

    "abstract": "The high prevalence of prematurity and low birth-weight places twin infants at increased risk for sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) and/or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Risk for these SUID and SIDS is affected by a combination of nonmodifiable intrinsic risk factors and modifiable extrinsic stressors including infant care practices related to sleep. Although adherence to the full scope of American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2011 recommendations is intended to decrease risk, these recommendations are aimed at singleton infants and may require tailoring for families with multiple infants.\nThe study describes infant care practices reported by mothers of twins in the first 6 months postpartum.\nMothers caring for twin infants (N = 35) were surveyed online both longitudinally (at 2, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after infant hospital discharge) and cross-sectionally. AAP recommendations (2011) guided survey content.\nThe degree of adherence to AAP recommendations varied over time. For example, mothers of twins reported 100% adherence to placing twins supine for sleep initially, but many reported putting babies on their stomachs for naps as twins became older. Sharing a parent's bedroom decreased over time as did frequency of crib sharing. Fewer than half of mothers offered a pacifier most or all of the time for sleep.\nOpportunities exist for development of an educational program geared specifically for postpartum parents of twins.\nBarriers affecting adherence to AAP recommendations and effectiveness of educational programs addressing needs of this unique population need further exploration.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have been done on infant feeding practices but few have focused on twins. The aim of this study was to compare the complementary feeding practices between mothers with twins and mothers with singletons.\nMother-infant pairs (50 mother-twin pairs and 50 mother-singleton pairs) with children aged 6 to 23 months were recruited from two public health clinics and communities in Tema and Ashaiman. Information was collected on the background characteristics of the mothers. Recumbent length and weight of the children were measured. Dietary information on the infants was collected using 24 hour recall. The differences between two groups were tested using independent t-student test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables.\nThe minimum dietary diversity (4+ food groups) was met by only 32% of the twins and 40% of the singletons, and 28% of the twins and 38% of the singletons met the requirement for minimum acceptable diet (minimum dietary diversity and the minimum meal frequency). Minimum meal frequency was met by 78% of the twins and 76% of the singletons. There were no significant differences between the two groups of infants. Prevalence of undernutrition was not significantly different among the two groups (twins versus singletons: underweight-26% versus 24%, stunting-20% versus 24% and wasting-14% versus 10%.\nComplementary feeding practices were suboptimal in both groups of mothers requiring interventions to improve infant feeding practices.",

    "abstract": "Longitudinal twin studies on long term conservation of individual metabolic phenotypes can help to explore the genetic and environmental basis in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and metabolic health. We performed a longitudinal twin study on 12 metabolic phenotypes from Danish twins followed up for 12 years and Chinese twins traced for 7 years. The study covered a relatively large sample of 502 pairs of Danish adult twins with a mean age at intake of 38 years and a total of 181 Chinese adult twin pairs with a mean baseline age of 39.5 years. Bivariate twin models were fitted to the longitudinal measurements taken at two time points (at baseline and follow-up) to estimate the genetic and environmental contributions to phenotype variation and correlation at and between the two time points. High genetic components in the regulation of intra-individual phenotype correlation or stability over time were estimated in both Danish (h2>0.75 except fasting blood glucose) and Chinese (h2>0.72 except blood pressure) twins; moderate to high genetic contribution to phenotype variation at the two time points were also estimated except for the low genetic regulation on glucose in Danish and on blood pressure in Chinese twins. Meanwhile the bivariate twin models estimated shared environmental contributions to the variance and covariance in fasting blood glucose in Danish twins, and in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low and high density lipoprotein cholesterol in Chinese twins. Overall, our longitudinal twin study on long-term stability of metabolic phenotypes in Danish and Chinese twins identified a common pattern of high genetic control over phenotype conservation, and at the same time revealed population-specific patterns of genetic and common environmental regulation on the variance as well as covariance of glucose and blood pressure.",

    "abstract": "The neurobiological mechanisms mediating an increased risk to develop affective disorders remain poorly understood. In a group of individuals with a family history of major depressive (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD), we investigated the microstructural properties of white matter fiber tracts, that is, cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, anterior limb of the internal capsule, and corpus callosum, that facilitate the communication between brain regions implicated in affective disorders.\nEighty-nine healthy mono- or dizygotic twins with a co-twin diagnosed with MDD or BD (high-risk) and 57 healthy twins with a co-twin with no familial history of affective disorders (low-risk) were included in a diffusion tensor imaging study.\nThe high-risk group showed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of water diffusion directionality, and increased radial diffusivity in the anterior region of corpus callosum compared to the low-risk group. This abnormality was not associated with zygosity or type of depressive disorder of co-twin.\nThe observed decreased anterior callosal fiber FA in the high-risk group may be indicative of a compromised interhemispheric communication between left and right frontal regions critically involved in mood regulation. Reduced anterior callosal FA may act as a vulnerability marker for affective disorders in individuals at familial risk.",

    "abstract": "Early colonization of gut microbiota in human gut is a complex process. It remains unclear when gut microbiota colonization occurs and how it proceeds. In order to study gut microbiota composition in human early life, the present study recruited 10 healthy pairs of twins, including five monozygotic (MZ) and five dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, whose age ranged from 0 to 6 years old. 20 fecal samples from these twins were processed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and their averaged data outputs were generated as 2G per sample. We used MEGAN5 to perform taxonomic and functional annotation of the metagenomic data, and systematically analyzed those 20 samples, including Jaccard index similarity, principle component, clustering, and correlation analyses. Our findings indicated that within our study group: 1) MZ-twins share more microbes than DZ twins or non-twin pairs, 2) gut microbiota distribution is relatively stable at metabolic pathways level, 3) age represents the strongest factor that can account for variation in gut microbiota, and 4) a clear metabolic pathway shift can be observed, which speculatively occurs around the age of 1 year old. This research will serve as a base for future studies of gut microbiota-related disease research.",

    "abstract": "Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is considered an autosomal dominant condition, which is commonly associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm. Both conditions pose the risk of valvular and aortic complications not only for affected patients but also for genetically related persons as well. The genetic underpinnings of these disease processes, which are in various stages of elucidation, have implications for screening and risk prognostication.\nTo analyze genetic differences between 2 pairs of monozygotic twins that had discordant aortic valve morphology, with 1 twin in each pair having a BAV and the other having a trileaflet aortic valve.\nTwo pairs of twins that were objectively determined to be monozygotic were examined at a tertiary care medical center associated with an academic medical center. Aortic valves that were surgically excised for clinical indications were examined for morphology. Whole-exome sequencing was performed for the twin pair that had discordance of aortic valve and aortic aneurysm. In the second pair, targeted gene sequencing of 25 genes known to be associated with BAV and/or thoracic aortic aneurysm was performed. In each pair, the twin with a BAV underwent surgical aortic valve replacement for clinical indications.\nGenetic coding variations between monozygotic twins using whole-exome sequencing and targeted gene sequencing.\nThis case series included 2 pairs of male monozygotic twins; one pair was aged 51 years and the other aged 59 years. Genetic sequencing methods identified no pathogenic sequence changes between the twins in each pair.\nOur findings challenge the traditional view of BAV as a condition with an entirely autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and emphasize the variability of penetrance of both BAV and thoracic aortic aneurysm as well as the variability of the association of the 2 conditions. Continued work to elucidate the genetic basis may lead to the refinement of risk stratification for affected patients and relatives.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasonography is an essential tool in the management of twin pregnancies. Fetal weight estimation is useful to anticipate neonatal care in case of weight restriction or growth discordance.\nTo assess the accuracy of estimated fetal weight (EFW) in twins and to assess the accuracy of sonographic examination to predict birth weight discordance (BWD) and small birth weight (SBW).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Methods : This was\u00a0 a longitudinal prospective study over a period of one year. We have included 50 twin pregnancies with a first trimester ultrasound calculated term and specified chorionicity. An ultrasound EFW was scheduled for all patients within an interval of 4 days before delivery. We calculated the differences between EFW and BW in terms of absolute difference and percentage error. We studied the correlation and the agreement between EFW and BW. Finally we calculated the sensitivity, the specificity, PPV and NPV of ultrasound in the diagnosis of BWD and SBW.\nAbsolute differences between BWF and BW were similar for the two twins. The relative difference was 7.7% [0-32] for T1 and 8.2% [0-27] for T2. The margin of error was greater than 10% in 38% of the cases for T1 and in 34% of cases for T2. Furthermore, correlation coefficients R1 and R2 for T1 and T2 were close to 1; R 1 =0.87 and\u00a0 R 2 = 0.89. Linear regression analysis allowed us to calculate the birth weight based on the estimated weight and this according to the following equations: For the first twin BW T1 = 0.846 * EFW 415,57+ T1 For the second twin BW T2 = 65.68 + 0.963 * EFW T2 in 34% of cases for T2. Chorionicity, presentation and gestational age did not affect the estimations. Ultrasonography in the diagnosis of SBW had a sensitivity of 90.32%, a specificity of 76.82%, a (PPV) of 80% and a (VPN) of 87%. The performance of ultrasound in the diagnosis of BWD varied according to the adopted threshold.\nUltrasound is an effective examination to estimate twins weight. Regarding prenatal diagnosis of birth weight discordance, the relevance of this examination increases with the adopted threshold.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation levels will be important for detection of epigenetic effects. However, there are few reports showing sex-related differences in the sensitivity to DNA methylation. To evaluate their sex-related individual differences in the sensitivity to methylation rigorously, we performed a systematic analysis of DNA methylation in monozygotic twins, an optimal model to evaluate them because the genetic backgrounds are the same.\nWe examined 30 male and 43 female older monozygotic twin pairs recruited from the registry established by the Center for Twin Research, Osaka University. Their methylation levels were determined using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Kit (Illumina), which interrogated 485577 highly informative CpG sites at the single-nucleotide resolution, and the median methylation level was calculated for each of the 25657 CpG islands. Within-pair differences of methylation levels (WPDMs) were greater in male pairs than female pairs for 86.0\u00a0% of autosomal CpG islands, but were higher in female pairs than male pairs for 76.7\u00a0% of X chromosomal CpG islands. Mean WPDMs of CpG islands in each autosomal chromosome were significantly higher in male pairs than in female whereas that in X chromosome was significantly higher in female pairs than in male. Multiple comparison indicated that WPDMs in three autosomal and two X-chromosomal CpG islands were significantly greater in male pairs, whereas those in 22 X-chromosomal CpG islands were significantly greater in female pairs.\nSex-related differences were present in the WPDMs of CpG islands in individuals with the same genetic background. These differences may be associated with the sexual influences in susceptibility of some diseases.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic-diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies are high risk, due to twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), twin anaemia polycythaemia sequence (TAPS) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). There is limited evidence to guide ultrasound surveillance protocols. Using a retrospective cohort, we aimed to provide insight into the optimal interval of ultrasound surveillance.\nRetrospective cohort of women with MCDA pregnancies who received antenatal care at Monash Medical Centre (January 2011-October 2014). We reviewed all ultrasounds from \u226515 weeks' gestation and collected perinatal outcomes.\nA total of 162 women with MCDA pregnancies attended our care. Six women were excluded due to late referral. Of the remaining 156, 55% were uncomplicated. TTTS, TAPS, IUGR and fetal demise in utero occurred in 9%, 1%, 31% and 2%, respectively. Median interval between the last ultrasound and TTTS diagnosis was 3.1 weeks (IQR 0.8-5.8). There was a trend towards a longer interval for cases with advanced TTTS compared to early TTTS. Interval between ultrasound scans was longer in cases with unexplained fetal demise in utero and advanced TTTS than early TTTS [3.4 weeks (IQR 2.0-6.9) vs. 0.9 weeks (IQR 0.4-3.7); p < 0.05].\nOur observations support current recommendations for fortnightly ultrasound surveillance in MCDA pregnancies from 16 weeks' gestation and suggest that longer intervals may be associated with poorer outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical properties of electrodeposited copper with highly-oriented nanoscale twins were investigated by micropillar compression. Uniform nanotwinned copper films with preferred twin orientations, either vertical or horizontal, were obtained by controlling the plating conditions. In addition, an ultrafine grained copper film was synthesized to be used as a reference sample. The mechanical properties were assessed by in situ SEM microcompression of micropillars fabricated with a focused ion beam. Results show that the mechanical properties are highly sensitive to the twin orientation. When compared to the ultrafine grained sample, an increase of 44% and 130% in stress at 5% offset strain was observed in quasi-static tests for vertically and horizontally aligned twins, respectively. Inversely strain rate jump microcompression testing reveals higher strain sensitivity for vertical twins. These observations are attributed to a change in deformation mechanism from dislocation pile-ups at the twin boundary for horizontal twins to dislocations threading inside the twin lamella for vertical twins.",

    "abstract": "Phaeochromocytoma is a tumor of the catecholamine-producing cells of the adrenal gland. Extraadrenal phaeochromocytomas are frequently called paragangliomas. The majority of phaeochromocytomas are sporadic, however, about 25-30% are caused by genetic mutation. These tumor are frequently referred as hereditary phaeochromocytomas/paragangliomas. Their incidence increases continuously which can be attributed to availability of genetic examination and to the discovery of novel genes. The 47-year-old female patient underwent abdominal computed tomography which revealed bilateral adrenal gland enlargement. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, the 131-I- metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy, urinary catecholamines and serum chomogranin A measurements confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral phaeochromocytomas. The genetically identical twin sister of the patient was also diagnosed with hormonally active bilateral phaechromocytoma, suggesting the genetic origin of phaeochromocytoma. Mutation screening confirmed a germline mutation of the transmembrane protein 127 tumorsupressor gene in both patients. Both patients underwent cortical-sparing adrenalectomy. The adrenal gland with the larger tumor was totally resected, while in the opposite side only the tumor was resected and a small part of the cortex was saved. After the operation urinary catecholamines and serum chromogranin A returned to normal in both patients. Adrenocortical deficiency was absent in the first patient, but her sister developed adrenal insufficiency requiring glucocorticoid replacement. To the best of the authors' knowledge phaeochromocytoma affecting twins has never been described earlier. Genetic examination performed in siblings confirmed the presence of the mutant gene through four generations. Orv. Hetil., 2016, 157(33), 1326-1330.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined: (1) gender and age differences of mean gender identity disorder (GID) trait scores in Japanese twins; (2) the validity of the prenatal hormone transfer theory, which predicts that, in dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, twins with an opposite-gender co-twin more frequently exhibit GID traits than twins with a same-gender co-twin; and (3) the magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on GID traits as a function of age and gender. Data from 1450 male twin pairs, 1882 female twin pairs, and 1022 DZ male-female pairs ranging from 3 to 26\u00a0years of age were analyzed. To quantify individual variances in GID traits, each participant completed four questionnaire items based on criteria for GID from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). Our most important findings were: (1) Japanese females exhibited GID traits more frequently than males and Japanese children exhibited GID traits less frequently than adolescents and adults (among females, the prevalence was 1.6\u00a0% in children, 10\u00a0% in adolescents, and 12\u00a0% in adults; among males, the prevalence was 0.5, 2, and 3\u00a0%, respectively); (2) the data did not support the prenatal hormone transfer theory for GID traits; and (3) a large part of the variance for GID traits in children was accounted for by familial factors; however, the magnitude was found to be greater in children than in adolescents or adults, particularly among females. This study suggests that although the prevalence is likely to increase, familial effects are likely to decrease as individuals age.",

    "abstract": "To estimate whether antenatal corticosteroids before 34 weeks of gestation are associated with reduced incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and composite neonatal morbidity in preterm twins.\nThis was a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized trial for the prevention of preterm birth in multiple gestations. All liveborn, nonanomalous twins delivered between 24 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation were included. Neonatal outcomes were compared between women who received antenatal corticosteroids and those who did not. The primary outcome was the incidence of RDS. The secondary outcome was the incidence of serious composite neonatal morbidity. Multivariable log Poisson regression with correlation adjustment between twins born to the same mother was performed for confounder control. Adjusted relative risks (RRs) are reported for study outcomes. Based on a post hoc power analysis, this study was powered to detect an RR less than 0.63 for RDS and greater than 1.43 for composite neonatal morbidity outcomes.\nA total of 432 women (850 neonates) were included. Only 300 (35%) neonates were born to women receiving antenatal corticosteroids. After multivariable regression, antenatal corticosteroids were not associated with a reduced incidence of RDS (81 [27%] compared with 92 [17%] neonates, adjusted RR 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-1.71) or composite neonatal morbidity (87 [29%] compared with 108 [20%] neonates, adjusted RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.93-1.56). However, antenatal corticosteroids were associated with increased rates of neonatal intensive care unit admissions (235 [78%] compared with 322 [59%] neonates, adjusted RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09-1.36) and mechanical ventilation (70 [23%] compared with 66 [12%] neonates, adjusted RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.12-2.09). Focusing analysis to newborns delivered before 34 weeks of gestation (n=311), 161 (52%) received antenatal corticosteroids. Similarly, no differences in the rate of RDS (66 [41%] compared with 68 [45%] neonates, adjusted RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76-1.34) or composite neonatal morbidity (72 [45%] compared with 81 [54%] neonates, adjusted RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.74-1.22) were noted.\nIn this cohort of preterm twins, antenatal corticosteroid administration was not associated with a reduced incidence of RDS and composite neonatal morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Education is associated with health related lifestyle choices including leisure-time physical inactivity. However, the longitudinal associations between education and inactivity merit further studies. We investigated the association between education and leisure-time physical inactivity over a 35-year follow-up with four time points controlling for multiple covariates including familial confounding.\nThis study of the population-based Finnish Twin Cohort consisted of 5254 twin individuals born in 1945-1957 (59\u00a0% women), of which 1604 were complete same-sexed twin pairs. Data on leisure-time physical activity and multiple covariates was available from four surveys conducted in 1975, 1981, 1990 and 2011 (response rates 72 to 89\u00a0%). The association between years of education and leisure-time physical inactivity (<1.5 metabolic equivalent hours/day) was first analysed for each survey. Then, the role of education was investigated for 15-year and 35-year inactivity periods in the longitudinal analyses. The co-twin control design was used to analyse the potential familial confounding of the effects. All analyses were conducted with and without multiple covariates. Odds Ratios (OR) with 95\u00a0% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic and conditional (fixed-effects) regression models.\nEach additional year of education was associated with less inactivity (OR 0.94 to 0.95, 95\u00a0% CI 0.92, 0.99) in the cross-sectional age- and sex-adjusted analyses. The associations of education with inactivity in the 15- and 35-year follow-ups showed a similar trend: OR 0.97 (95\u00a0% CI 0.93, 1.00) and OR 0.94 (95 % CI 0.91, 0.98), respectively. In all co-twin control analyses, each year of higher education was associated with a reduced likelihood of inactivity suggesting direct effect (i.e. independent from familial confounding) of education on inactivity. However, the point estimates were lower than in the individual-level analyses. Adjustment for multiple covariates did not change these associations.\nHigher education is associated with lower odds of leisure-time physical inactivity during the three-decade follow-up. The association was found after adjusting for several confounders, including familial factors. Hence, the results point to the conclusion that education has an independent role in the development of long-term physical inactivity and tailored efforts to promote physical activity among lower educated people would be needed throughout adulthood.",

The associations of education with inactivity in the 15- and 35-year follow-ups showed a similar trend: OR 0.97 (95\u00a0% CI 0.93, 1.00) and OR 0.94 (95 % CI 0.91, 0.98), respectively. In all co-twin control analyses, each year of higher education was associated with a reduced likelihood of inactivity suggesting direct effect (i.e. independent from familial confounding) of education on inactivity. However, the point estimates were lower than in the individual-level analyses. Adjustment for multiple covariates did not change these associations.",

    "abstract": "Twins may be at increased risk of dysglycaemic disorders due to adverse fetal conditions. Data from Africa regarding this association is limited. We studied impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and other types of dysglycemia among twins and singletons in Guinea-Bissau.\nThe study was conducted from February 2011 until March 2012 at the Bandim Health Project, a health and demographic surveillance system site in the capital Bissau. Twins (n\u2009=\u2009209) and singletons (n\u2009=\u2009182) were recruited from a previously established cohort. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed, along with anthropometrics and collection of clinical and dietary data.\nMedian age was 16.6 and 14.2\u00a0years between twins and singletons, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.08). Mean birth weight was 2410 vs. 3090\u00a0g, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Twins had higher median fasting- and two hour capillary plasma glucose, 5.4(3.2-8.2) vs. 5.0(3.2-11.5) mmol/L (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and 6.8(3.4-11.3) vs. 6.2(3.2-12.1) mmol/L (P\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively, compared to singletons. The prevalence of IGT was 2.5\u00a0% (5/209) vs. 3.5\u00a0% (6/182) (RR\u2009=\u20090.73, 95 % CI: 0.20-2.64). 12\u00a0% (25/209) of twins had impaired fasting glucose (IFG), compared to 3.5\u00a0% (6/182) of singletons (3.63, 1.53-8.62). Dysglycemia (IGT and/or IFG or overt diabetes) was found in 17\u00a0% (35/209) vs. 9\u00a0% (16/182) (1.90, 1.08-3.37), respectively.\nTwins had higher glucose levels in both the fasting and postprandial state. This may indicate a detrimental effect of the twin fetal environment on glucose metabolism later in life, a result contrary to Scandinavian register studies. The IGT burden was low in this young age group and the risk was similar in twins and singletons.",

    "abstract": "Avoiding overeating and being physically active is associated with healthy aging, but methodological issues challenge the quantification of the association. Intrapair comparison of twins is a study design that attempts to minimize social norm-driven biased self-reporting of lifestyle factors. We aimed to investigate the association between self-reported lifestyle factors and subsequent survival in 347 Danish twin pairs aged 70 years and older and, additionally, to investigate the reliability of these self-reports. The twins were interviewed in 2003 and followed for mortality until 2015. They were asked to compare their appetite and physical activity to that of their co-twins in different stages of life. On an individual level, we found a positive association between current self-reported physical activity and late-life survival for elderly twins. This was supported by the intrapair analyses, which revealed a positive association between midlife and current physical activity and late-life survival. A positive association between lower appetite and late-life survival was found generally over the life course in the individual level analyses but not in the intrapair analyses. Kappa values for the inter-twin agreement on who ate the most were 0.16 to 0.34 in different life stages, and for physical activity 0.19 to 0.26, corresponding to a slight-to-fair agreement. Approximately, 50% of the twin pairs were not in agreement regarding physical activity, and of these twins 75% (95% CI: 67-82%) considered themselves the most active twin. These findings indicate a still-existing tendency of answering according to social norms, even in a twin study designed to minimize this.",

    "abstract": "Mental wellbeing and mental illness symptoms are typically conceptualized as opposite ends of a continuum, despite only sharing about a quarter in common variance. We investigated the normative variation in measures of wellbeing and of depression and anxiety in 1486 twins who did not meet clinical criteria for an overt diagnosis. We quantified the shared versus distinct genetic and environmental variance between wellbeing and depression and anxiety symptoms. The majority of participants (93%) reported levels of depression and anxiety symptoms within the healthy range, yet only 23% reported a wellbeing score within the \"flourishing\" range: the remainder were within the ranges of \"moderate\" (67%) or \"languishing\" (10%). In twin models, measures of wellbeing and of depression and anxiety shared 50.09% of variance due to genetic factors and 18.27% due to environmental factors; the rest of the variance was due to unique variation impacting wellbeing or depression and anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest that an absence of clinically-significant symptoms of depression and anxiety does not necessarily indicate that an individual is flourishing. Both unique and shared genetic and environmental factors may determine why some individuals flourish in the absence of symptoms while others do not.",

    "abstract": "Milk provides a significant source of calcium, protein, vitamins and other minerals to Western populations throughout life. Due to its widespread use, the metabolic and health impact of milk consumption warrants further investigation and biomarkers would aid epidemiological studies.\nMilk intake assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire was analyzed against fasting blood metabolomic profiles from two metabolomic platforms in females from the TwinsUK cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a03559). The top metabolites were then replicated in two independent populations (EGCUT, n\u00a0=\u00a01109 and KORA, n\u00a0=\u00a01593), and the results from all cohorts were meta-analyzed.\nFour metabolites were significantly associated with milk intake in the TwinsUK cohort after adjustment for multiple testing (P\u00a0<\u00a08.08\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\nWe identified and replicated in independent populations four novel biomarkers of milk intake: trimethyl-N-aminovalerate, uridine, hydroxysphingomyelin C14:1 and diacylphosphatidylcholine C28:1.

    "abstract": "Twin studies have estimated the relative contribution of genes and the environment to variance in exercise behavior and it is known that parental education positively affects exercise levels. This study investigates the role of parental education as a potential modifier of variance in exercise behavior from age 7 to 18\u00a0years. The study is based on large datasets from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR: N\u00a0=\u00a024\u00a0874 twins; surveys around the ages of 7, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18\u00a0years) and two Finnish twin cohorts (FinnTwin12: N\u00a0=\u00a04399; 12, 14 and 17\u00a0years; FinnTwin16: N\u00a0=\u00a04648; 16, 17 and 18\u00a0years). Regular participation in moderate-to-vigorous exercise activities during leisure time was assessed by survey. Parental education was dichotomized (\"both parents with a low education\" vs \"at least one parent with a high education\"). The mean in exercise behavior tended to be higher and the variance tended to be lower in children of high educated parents. Evidence for gene-by-environment interaction was weak. To develop successful interventions that specifically target children of low educated parents, the mechanisms causing the mean and variance differences between the two groups should be better understood.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the rate of pulmonary stenosis and functional pulmonary atresia (PS/PA) in recipient twins prior to fetal surgery for twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and their pre- and postnatal outcomes.\nWe carried out a prospective study including 260 cases of TTTS. Echocardiography was performed before laser surgery to detect the presence of PS/PA. The outcomes of recipients with and without PS/PA were compared. The need of postnatal cardiac interventions and the survival rate at 6 months of age were also evaluated.\nPS was observed in 16/260 (6.2%) of recipient twins and PA in 12/260 (4.6%). After fetal surgery, 10/28 (35.7%) recipients died, 9/28 (32.1%) showed in utero regression, and 9/28 (32.1%) had persistence of PS/PA. Postnatally, seven recipients underwent percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty, one required surgical valvotomy and one palliative surgery. Pregnancies with recipient twins with PS/PA had lower survival of at least one twin (67.9 vs. 83.6%, p = 0.045) and lower overall survival (57.1 vs. 72.8%, p = 0.015) at 6 months of age.\nPS and PA were observed in 10.8% of recipients. Among these, about one third showed persistence of pulmonary valve pathology after delivery, which stresses the need for strict follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Racial disparities in education in Brazil (and elsewhere) are well documented. Because this research typically examines educational variation between individuals in different families, however, it cannot disentangle whether racial differences in education are due to racial discrimination or to structural differences in unobserved neighborhood and family characteristics. To address this common data limitation, we use an innovative within-family twin approach that takes advantage of the large sample of Brazilian adolescent twins classified as different races in the 1982 and 1987-2009 Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domic\u00edlios. We first examine the contexts within which adolescent twins in the same family are labeled as different races to determine the characteristics of families crossing racial boundaries. Then, as a way to hold constant shared unobserved and observed neighborhood and family characteristics, we use twins fixed-effects models to assess whether racial disparities in education exist between twins and whether such disparities vary by gender. We find that even under this stringent test of racial inequality, the nonwhite educational disadvantage persists and is especially pronounced for nonwhite adolescent boys.",

    "abstract": "Literature suggests that male hormones influence fetal growth in singleton pregnancies. We hypothesized that the same phenomenon is seen in twin gestations.\n(1) to identify the impact of gender associated with fetal birth weight, head circumference, and birth length for twins; (2) to examine the effect of gender on standardized fetal growth at birth, according to gestational age and birth order; (3) to examine the effect of gender on placenta weight and dimensions.\nThis was a population-based retrospective cohort study of twins (4,368 twins, 2,184 pairs) born in British Columbia, Canada from 2000-2010. We excluded twins with stillbirth, congenital anomalies, and those delivered with cesarean section. We also controlled for confounding factors, including birth order, gestational age, maternal anthropometric measures, maternal smoking habits, and obstetric history. A subsample of this population was analyzed from Children and Women Hospital to obtain chorionicity information.\nMale-male twins were heavier than male-females and female-female twin pairs (p=.01). Within sex-discordant twin pairs, males were also heavier than females (p=.01). Regression analysis suggested that gender affects birth weight independent of birth order and gestational age. Other newborn anthropometric measures were not found to be dependent on gender. In analyzing a subsample with chorionicity data, birth weight was the only anthropometric measure that was both statistically and clinically affected by sex, even after adjustment for gestational age, chorionicity, birth order, and maternal age.\nBirth weight was affected by gender while head circumference and birth length were not.",

In the 1960s, identical twin David Bruce Reimer was accidentally castrated as an infant during circumcision to correct a urinary problem. The decision to raise him as a girl, and the consequences of that decision, are explored in the new theatrical production of Boy. Other examples of the arts mirroring science, and vice versa, are described. Next, brief reviews and summaries of twin research on sexual orientation, 1860s' knowledge of placental arrangements and twinning mechanisms, and genes underlying multiple birth conception and fertility related measures are provided.

    "abstract": "Our aim was to test the direction of causation between self-report parental monitoring (PM) and the liability to illicit drug initiation (DI) as indicated by cannabis, cocaine, and stimulants. We fitted a multiple indicator model to test causal and non-causal models based on a large, genetically informative cross-sectional sample of male twins. The sample comprised 1,778 males aged 24-62 years from the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders. Data came from self-report measures of lifetime cannabis, stimulants, and cocaine initiation, and retrospective assessment of PM between ages 8-17 years. Multivariate modeling showed that familial aggregation in PM and DI were both explained by a combination of additive genetic and shared environmental effects. Moreover, the significant association between PM and DI was best explained by a correlated liability model versus causal models. PM has typically been assumed to be an environmental, causal risk factor for drug use and has been shown to be among the more salient environmental risk factors for illicit DI. Our data were not consistent with this causal hypothesis. Instead, a correlated liability model in which PM and risk of DI share common genetic and environmental risks provided a better fit to the data.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we assemble five large administrative data sets in Taiwan to investigate the short-run and long-run effects of birth weight. Comparing with previous studies, our results are more precisely estimated due to the large sample size. Using administrative data sets, the problems arising from self-reported samples are also mitigated. Moreover, we are able to examine both singletons by controlling sibling fixed effects and twins by controlling twin fixed effects. Our results show that an infant's birth weight has positive influence on health and education. Our twin fixed-effects estimates confirm the finding of a long-lasting, but diminishing in the longer run, effects of birth weight. Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "There is a gap in knowledge regarding the cardiovascular system in fish conjoined twins, and regarding the cardiovascular morphogenesis of conjoined twins in general. We examined the cardiovascular system in a pair of fully developed ventrally conjoined salmonid twins (45.5\u00a0g body weight), and the arrangement of the blood vessels during early development in ventrally conjoined yolk sac larvae salmonid twins (<0.5\u00a0g body weight).\nIn the fully developed twins, one twin was normal, while the other was small and severely malformed. The mouth of the small twin was blocked, inhibiting respiration and feeding. Both twins had hearts, but these were connected through a common circulatory system. They were joined by the following blood vessels: (i) arteria iliaca running from arteria caudalis of the large twin to the kidney of the small twin; (ii) arteria subclavia running from aorta dorsalis of the large twin to aorta dorsalis of the small twin; (iii) vena hepatica running from the liver of the small twin into the sinus venosus of the large twin. Among the yolk sac larvae twins investigated, distinct vascular connections were found in some individuals through a joined v. vitellina hepatica.\nVentrally conjoined fish twins can develop cardiovascular connections during early development, enabling a normal superior twin to supply a malfunctioning twin with oxygen and nutrients. Since the yolk sac in salmonids is transparent, twinning in salmonids may be a useful model in which to study cardiovascular morphogenesis in conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "The brain continuously develops and reorganizes to support an expanding repertoire of behaviors and increasingly complex cognition. These processes may, however, also result in the appearance or disappearance of specific neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention problems. To investigate whether brain activity changed during adolescence, how genetics shape this change, and how these changes were related to attention problems, we measured EEG activity in 759 twins and siblings, assessed longitudinally in four waves (12, 14, 16, and 18years of age). Attention problems were assessed with the SWAN at waves 12, 14, and 16. To characterize functional brain development, we used a measure of temporal stability (TS) of brain oscillations over the recording time of 5min reflecting the tendency of a brain to maintain the same oscillatory state for longer or shorter periods. Increased TS may reflect the brain's tendency to maintain stability, achieve focused attention, and thus reduce \"mind wandering\" and attention problems. The results indicate that brain TS is increased across the scalp from 12 to 18. TS showed large individual differences that were heritable. Change in TS (alpha oscillations) was heritable between 12 and 14 and between 14 and 16 for the frontal brain areas. Absolute levels of brain TS at each wave were positively correlated with attention problems but not significantly. High and low attention problems subjects showed different developmental trajectories in TS, which was significant in a cluster of frontal leads. These results indicate that trajectories in brain TS development are a biomarker for the developing brain. TS in brain oscillations is highly heritable, and age-related change in TS is also heritable in selected brain areas. These results suggest that high and low attention problems subjects are at different stages of brain development.",

    "abstract": "Both genetic and environmental factors are known to affect body mass index (BMI), but detailed understanding of how their effects differ during childhood and adolescence is lacking.\nWe analyzed the genetic and environmental contributions to BMI variation from infancy to early adulthood and the ways they differ by sex and geographic regions representing high (North America and Australia), moderate (Europe), and low levels (East Asia) of obesogenic environments.\nData were available for 87,782 complete twin pairs from 0.5 to 19.5 y of age from 45 cohorts. Analyses were based on 383,092 BMI measurements. Variation in BMI was decomposed into genetic and environmental components through genetic structural equation modeling.\nThe variance of BMI increased from 5 y of age along with increasing mean BMI. The proportion of BMI variation explained by additive genetic factors was lowest at 4 y of age in boys (a(2) = 0.42) and girls (a(2) = 0.41) and then generally increased to 0.75 in both sexes at 19 y of age. This was because of a stronger influence of environmental factors shared by co-twins in midchildhood. After 15 y of age, the effect of shared environment was not observed. The sex-specific expression of genetic factors was seen in infancy but was most prominent at 13 y of age and older. The variance of BMI was highest in North America and Australia and lowest in East Asia, but the relative proportion of genetic variation to total variation remained roughly similar across different regions.\nEnvironmental factors shared by co-twins affect BMI in childhood, but little evidence for their contribution was found in late adolescence. Our results suggest that genetic factors play a major role in the variation of BMI in adolescence among populations of different ethnicities exposed to different environmental factors related to obesity.",

The proportion of BMI variation explained by additive genetic factors was lowest at 4 y of age in boys (a(2) = 0.42) and girls (a(2) = 0.41) and then generally increased to 0.75 in both sexes at 19 y of age. This was because of a stronger influence of environmental factors shared by co-twins in midchildhood. After 15 y of age, the effect of shared environment was not observed. The sex-specific expression of genetic factors was seen in infancy but was most prominent at 13 y of age and older. The variance of BMI was highest in North America and Australia and lowest in East Asia, but the relative proportion of genetic variation to total variation remained roughly similar across different regions.",

    "abstract": "Human life expectancy is influenced not only by longevity assurance mechanisms and disease susceptibility loci but also by the environment, gene-environment interactions, and chance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs closely related to genes. Circulating miRNAs have been shown as promising noninvasive biomarkers in the development of many pathophysiological conditions. However, the concentration of miRNA in the circulation may also be affected by environmental factors. We used a next-generation sequencing platform to assess the association of circulating miRNA with life expectancy, for which deaths are due to all causes independent of genes. In addition, we showed that miRNAs are present in 41-year archived plasma samples, which may be useful for both life expectancy and all-cause mortality risk assessment. Plasma miRNAs from nine identical male twins were profiled using next-generation sequencing. The average absolute difference in the minimum life expectancy was 9.68 years. Intraclass correlation coefficients were above 0.4 for 50% of miRNAs. Comparing deceased twins with their alive co-twin brothers, the concentrations were increased for 34 but decreased for 30 miRNAs. Identical twins discordant in life expectancy were dissimilar in the majority of miRNAs, suggesting that environmental factors are pivotal in miRNAs related to life expectancy.",

    "abstract": "By using historical data on about 50,000 twins born in Sweden during 1886-1958, we demonstrate a positive and statistically significant relationship between years of schooling and longevity. This relation remains almost unchanged when exploiting a twin fixed-effects design to control for the influence of genetics and shared family background. This result is robust to controlling for within-twin-pair differences in early-life health and cognitive ability, as proxied by birth weight and height, as well as to restricting the sample to MZ twins. The relationship is fairly constant over time but becomes weaker with age. Literally, our results suggest that compared with low levels of schooling (less than 10 years), high levels of schooling (at least 13 years of schooling) are associated with about three years longer life expectancy at age 60 for the considered birth cohorts. The real societal value of schooling may hence extend beyond pure labor market and economic growth returns. From a policy perspective, schooling may therefore be a vehicle for improving longevity and health, as well as equality along these dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia (HI/HA) syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by recurrent hypoglycemia and persistent mild elevation of plasma ammonia. HI/HA syndrome is one of the more common forms of congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), caused by activating mutations within the GLUD1 gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). We report here on monozygotic twin girls presented with fasting- and protein-induced hypoglycemia and mild persistent hyperammonemia. Genetic analysis revealed that both girls were heterozygous for a novel missense mutation within exon 11 [c.1499A>T, p.(R443W)] of the GLUD1 gene. Despite early treatment with diazoxide and a low protein diet, they both developed non-hypoglycemic seizures in early childhood followed by cognitive impairment. In addition to their clinical course, a review of the literature on HI/HA syndrome is provided.",

    "abstract": "We report the first documented successful birth of twins following preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) of cleavage stage embryos by array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) technology, in South India. The case was a 28-year-old woman with the previous history of preclinical pregnancy and a miscarriage in two attempted in vitro fertilization cycles. Day 3 cleavage stage embryos were generated by conventional long protocol with the use of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog and a combination of recombinant folliculotropins and human menopausal gonadotropins. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection of oocytes thus obtained was performed, and 10 selected embryos underwent PGS using the array CGH technique. Two normal blastocysts were transferred to the patient, and she conceived twins. She delivered at 35 weeks of gestation by elective cesarean on November 19, 2014. She delivered a healthy male and female baby weighing 2.19 kg and 2.26 kg, respectively. Postnatal evaluation of babies was also normal, and the hospital course was uneventful. PGS has a definitive indication in assisted reproductive technology programs and can be utilized to improve pregnancy rates significantly.",

    "abstract": "The co-occurrence of gonadal agenesis alongside hypoplastic derivatives of the paramesonephric ducts has rarely been observed.\n16-year-old dizygotic twin sisters were referred to our department because of primary amenorrhea. X-ray, bone densitometry, ultrasonography, pelvic MRI and measurement of pituitary, ovary, and thyroid hormones were performed. Both twins showed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, bilateral gonadal agenesis, fallopian tube, uterus, and vaginal hypoplasia but normal kidney and urinary tract structures and skeletal system. Analysis of Q-banded chromosomes in peripheral blood for the search for centromeric X-chromosome DNA and SRY gene was normal as well as the molecular analysis of FMR1, GDF9, and BMP15 genes. Estradiol gel was administered for one year followed by estroprogestin treatment. Both twins growth increased; breast development was stimulated and first menses occurred. Deregulation in the expression of the various HOX genes along the axis of the developing reproductive tract in a determinate time of development may be one of the mechanisms involved in the origin of this complex and rare association.",

    "abstract": "Measuring cortisol in hair is a promising method to assess long-term alterations of the biological stress response system, and hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) may be altered in psychiatric disorders and in subjects suffering from chronic stress. However, the pattern of associations between HCC, chronic stress and mental health require clarification. Our exploratory study: (1) assessed the association between HCC and perceived stress, symptoms of depression and neuroticism, and the trait extraversion (as a control variable); and (2) made use of the twin design to estimate the genetic and environmental covariance between the variables of interest. Hair samples from 109 (74 female) subjects (age range 12-21 years, mean 15.1) including 8 monozygotic (MZ) and 21 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs were analyzed. Perceived stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale and/or the Daily Life and Stressors Scale, neuroticism, and extraversion with the NEO-Five Factor Inventory or the Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and depressive symptoms with the Somatic and Psychological Health Report. We found a modest positive association between HCC and the three risk factors - perceived stress, symptoms of depression, and neuroticism (r = 0.22-0.33) - but no correlation with extraversion (-0.06). A median split revealed that the associations between HCC and risk factors were stronger (0.47-0.60) in those subjects with HCC >11.36 pg/mg. Furthermore, our results suggest that the genetic effects underlying HCC are largely shared with those that influence perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and neuroticism. These results of our proof of principle study warrant replication in a bigger sample but raise the interesting question of the direction of causation between these variables.",

Trisomy 21 is associated with high incidence of congenital heart defects, and commonly occurs with ventricular septal defects (VSDs). Physiologic burden of VSDs depends on prevalence of anatomic and other circulatory factors. A case of identical twins with trisomy 21 and large VSDs is described in the present report. Though genetically identical, phenotypes varied significantly. One twin was managed medically, while the other developed more significant heart failure, requiring operative repair.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare phenomenon, occurring in 1% of monochorionic twin gestation, with an incidence of 1\u2009:\u200950\u2009000 to 1\u2009:\u2009100\u2009000. Many conjoined twins have abnormalities incompatible with life, so early prenatal diagnosis is very important for optimal management of both pregnancy and delivery. We report a case of dicephalus parapagus conjoined twins, sharing a single heart, diagnosed at 12 weeks' gestation. With early ultrasound diagnosis, we were able to provide appropriate and timely prenatal counseling to the family.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twins are usually monozygotic and thus usually have the same sex. A case of monochorionic diamniotic twins following IVF/ICSI and laser treatment of the zona pellucida (\"assisted hatching\") is presented in which partial embryo amalgamation appears to have occurred. Discordant sex between the twins was suspected on detailed antenatal ultrasound at 13\u2009+\u20093 weeks gestation and was confirmed on subsequent examinations. The sexual phenotype at birth was female for one twin and male for the other. Placental histology confirmed the monochorionic, diamniotic situation. Cytogenetic analysis of both twins was carried out postpartum on various tissues. On karyotyping of blood lymphocytes the male and female twins each had one mosaic of male and female cells. Oral mucosal cells showed normal male and female karyotypes respectively. Analysis of urothelium showed a normal result for the male infant, and a weak gonosomal mosaic with an XX and XY constellation for the female infant. At least for blood lymphocytes, a diagnosis of chimerism was proven.\n\u00dcblicherweise sind monochoriale Zwillingsschwangerschaften monozygot und weisen dasselbe Geschlecht auf. Im vorliegenden Fall war nach IVF/ICSI und Laserbehandlung der Zona pellucida (\u201eassisted hatching\u201c) eine monochoriale, diamniote Geminigravidit\u00e4t eingetreten, bei der es wohl zu einer partiellen Verschmelzung der Embryonen kam. Pr\u00e4natal wurde in der 13\u2009+\u20093\u2009SSW im Rahmen einer detaillierten Ultraschalldiagnostik der Verdacht auf eine Diskrepanz der Geschlechter der Gemini gestellt, der sich in den Folgeuntersuchungen best\u00e4tigte. Post partum war das ph\u00e4notypische Geschlecht des einen Zwillings weiblich und des anderen m\u00e4nnlich. Die Histologie der Plazenta best\u00e4tigte die monochorialen, diamnioten Eihautverh\u00e4ltnisse. Postnatal erfolgte die zytogenetische Analyse der Zwillinge in verschiedenen Geweben. Die Karyotypisierung an Blutlymphozyten ergab f\u00fcr den weiblichen und m\u00e4nnlichen Zwilling jeweils ein Mosaik aus m\u00e4nnlichen und weiblichen Zellen. In den Mundschleimhautzellen zeigte sich f\u00fcr beide Neugeborene ein unauff\u00e4lliger m\u00e4nnlicher bzw. weiblicher Karyotyp. Die Diagnostik an Urothelzellen war f\u00fcr das m\u00e4nnliche Neugeborene ebenfalls unauff\u00e4llig und zeigte f\u00fcr das weibliche Neugeborene ein schwaches gonosomales Mosaik mit XX- und XY-Konstellation. Zumindest f\u00fcr Blutlymphozyten konnte die Diagnose der Chim\u00e4ren bewiesen werden.",

The R117H-CFTR mutation has variability directly relating to in cis poly-thymidine alleles, producing a differing spectrum of disease. This paper provides evidence of extreme phenotype variability - including fertility status - in the context of male monogenetic twins, discussing mechanisms and highlighting the diagnostic and treatment challenges.",

    "abstract": "Although familial aggregation of lymphoproliferative disorders has been described, heredity has not been implicated in the etiology of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (PCBCL). We report herein the first case of 2 young monozygotic twins with PCBCL. The first twin was an 18-year-old woman when she presented with multiple skin nodules on the thorax and head. Histology showed an atypical small B-cell proliferation, consistent with primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL). Molecular genetics studies demonstrated B-cell clonality. Seven years later, the second twin developed her first lesion that was histologically similar to that of her twin. She subsequently developed other clinically similar lesions. Histology was consistent with PCMZL and showed B-cell clonality. Occurrence of PCBCL in these monozygotic twins raises the possibility of a genetic risk factor. Further study of such rare cases may offer valuable insights into the molecular basis of the etiology and pathogenesis of this unusual disorder.",

    "abstract": "Using dietary biomarkers in nutritional epidemiological studies may better capture exposure and improve the level at which diet-disease associations can be established and explored. Here, we aimed to identify and evaluate reproducibility of novel biomarkers of reported habitual food intake using targeted and non-targeted metabolomic blood profiling in a large twin cohort. Reported intakes of 71 food groups, determined by FFQ, were assessed against 601 fasting blood metabolites in over 3500 adult female twins from the TwinsUK cohort. For each metabolite, linear regression analysis was undertaken in the discovery group (excluding MZ twin pairs discordant [\u22651 SD apart] for food group intake) with each food group as a predictor adjusting for age, batch effects, BMI, family relatedness and multiple testing (1.17x10-6 = 0.05/[71 food groups x 601 detected metabolites]). Significant results were then replicated (non-targeted: P<0.05; targeted: same direction) in the MZ discordant twin group and results from both analyses meta-analyzed. We identified and replicated 180 significant associations with 39 food groups (P<1.17x10-6), overall consisting of 106 different metabolites (74 known and 32 unknown), including 73 novel associations. In particular we identified trans-4-hydroxyproline as a potential marker of red meat intake (0.075[0.009]; P = 1.08x10-17), ergothioneine as a marker of mushroom consumption (0.181[0.019]; P = 5.93x10-22), and three potential markers of fruit consumption (top association: apple and pears): including metabolites derived from gut bacterial transformation of phenolic compounds, 3-phenylpropionate (0.024[0.004]; P = 1.24x10-8) and indolepropionate (0.026[0.004]; P = 2.39x10-9), and threitol (0.033[0.003]; P = 1.69x10-21). With the largest nutritional metabolomics dataset to date, we have identified 73 novel candidate biomarkers of food intake for potential use in nutritional epidemiological studies. We compiled our findings into the DietMetab database (http://www.twinsuk.ac.uk/dietmetab-data/), an online tool to investigate our top associations.",

    "abstract": "Cystatin C is associated with both renal function and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). We have previously shown a genetic correlation between cystatin C and prevalent ASCVD. The objective of this article is to study whether variation in cystatin C or creatinine predicts incident ASCVD when controlled for genetic factors.\nThe predictive value of cystatin C and creatinine for incident ASCVD was studied in 11\u00a0402 Swedish twins, free of CVD at baseline, in an adjusted Cox-regression model during a median follow-up of 71\u00a0months. Twin pairs discordant for incident stroke, myocardial infarction and ASCVD during follow-up were identified and within-pair comparisons regarding cystatin C and creatinine levels were performed. We also investigated whether contact frequency and degree of shared environment influences were associated with similarity in cystatin C levels. In univariate analysis, cystatin C predicted incident ASCVD hazard ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.47-1.67. When adjusted for traditional Framingham risk factors as covariates, cystatin C remained a predictor of incident stroke hazard ratio 1.45, 95% CI (1.25-1.70), ASCVD hazard ratio 1.26, 95% CI (1.13-1.41), and myocardial infarction hazard ratio 1.16, 95% CI (1.01-1.33). In twins discordant for incident stroke, cystatin C at baseline was higher in the twin who experienced a stroke compared to the healthy co-twin (1.11\u00b10.3\u00a0mg/L versus 1.06\u00b10.3\u00a0mg/L), whereas creatinine was lower in the twin who developed CVD compared to their healthy co-twins (76.1\u00b116.9\u00a0\u03bcmol/L versus 79.4\u00b120.3\u00a0\u03bcmol/L).\nVariation in cystatin C relates to incident ASCVD and to stroke when adjusted for genetic confounding. In identical twins, cystatin C may be a sensitive marker of early hypertensive end-organ damage and small-vessel disease, whereas creatinine level may reflect nutritional status. The findings in disease-discordant monozygotic twins indicate that unique, possibly preventable, environmental factors are important.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol intake may be associated with cancer risk, but epidemiologic evidence for prostate cancer is inconsistent. We aimed to prospectively investigate the association between midlife alcohol intake and drinking patterns with future prostate cancer risk and mortality in a population-based cohort of Finnish twins.\nData were drawn from the Older Finnish Twin Cohort and included 11,372 twins followed from 1981 to 2012. Alcohol consumption was assessed by questionnaires administered at two time points over follow-up. Over the study period, 601 incident cases of prostate cancer and 110 deaths from prostate cancer occurred. Cox regression was used to evaluate associations between weekly alcohol intake and binge drinking patterns with prostate cancer risk and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Within-pair co-twin analyses were performed to control for potential confounding by shared genetic and early environmental factors.\nCompared to light drinkers (\u22643 drinks/week; non-abstainers), heavy drinkers (>14 drinks/week) were at a 1.46-fold higher risk (HR 1.46; 95\u00a0% CI 1.12, 1.91) of prostate cancer, adjusting for important confounders. Among current drinkers, binge drinkers were at a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer (HR 1.28; 95\u00a0% CI 1.06, 1.55) compared to non-binge drinkers. Abstainers were at a 1.90-fold higher risk (HR 1.90; 95\u00a0% CI 1.04, 3.47) of prostate cancer-specific mortality compared to light drinkers, but no other significant associations for mortality were found. Co-twin analyses suggested that alcohol consumption may be associated with prostate cancer risk independent of early environmental and genetic factors.\nHeavy regular alcohol consumption and binge drinking patterns may be associated with increased prostate cancer risk, while abstinence may be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality compared to light alcohol consumption.",

    "abstract": "The mutations in the dual oxidase maturation factor 2 (DUOXA2) and dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2) genes have been identified in patients with congenital hypothyroidism (CH). This study reports a set of dizygotic twins with CH due to the mutations in the DUOX2/DUOXA2 system.\nThe dizygotic twins, a boy and a girl, both aged 7 years, were born to euthyroid nonconsanguineous parents; they were diagnosed with CH at neonatal screening and were enrolled in this study. The DUOXA2, DUOX2, paired box 8 (PAX8), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) genes were considered for mutation screening. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, and Sanger sequencing was used to screen for the mutations in the exon fragments. Family members of the patients were also enrolled and evaluated.\nThe fraternal twins each harbored a single heterozygous mutation, including c.738C>G (p.Y246X) in the boy inherited from the paternal DUOXA2 allele and c.2654G>A (p.R885Q) in the girl from the maternal DUOX2 allele. The two mutations have been previously reported. The boy showed enlarged thyroid lobes and a little calcification in the left lobe, while the girl's thyroid gland was severely underdeveloped and the girl had obvious complications due to irregular treatment. The germline mutations from this family were consistent with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. No mutations in the PAX8, TPO, and TSHR genes were detected in this study.\nThe inactivating mutations in the DUOXA2 (p.Y246X) and DUOX2 (p.R885Q) genes were identified in a set of dizygotic twins with CH. The girl was more severe in several aspects than her brother. The similar genetic defect resulted in very different outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Attempted separation of craniopagus twins has continued to be associated with devastating results since the first partially successful separation with one surviving twin in 1952. To understand the factors that contribute to successful separation in the modern era of neuroimaging and modern surgical techniques, the authors reviewed and analyzed cases reported since 1995.\nAll reported cases of craniopagus twin separation attempts from 1995 to 2015 were identified using PubMed (n = 19). In addition, the Internet was searched for additional unreported separation attempts (n = 5). The peer-reviewed cases were used to build a categorical database containing information on each twin pair, including sex; date of birth; date of surgery; multiple- versus single-stage surgery; angular versus vertical conjoining; nature of shared cerebral venous system; and the presence of other comorbidities identified as cardiovascular, genitourinary, and craniofacial. The data were analyzed to find factors associated with successful separation (survival of both twins at postoperative day 30).\nVertical craniopagus is associated with successful separation (p < 0.001). No statistical significance was attributed to the nature of the shared cerebral venous drainage or the other variables examined. Multiple-stage operations and surgery before 12 months of age are associated with a trend toward statistical significance for successful separation.\nThe authors' analysis indicates that vertical craniopagus twins have the highest likelihood of successful separation. Additional factors possibly associated with successful separation include the nature of the shared sinus system, surgery at a young age, and the use of staged separations.\nTherapeutic, V.",

    "abstract": "Although monozygotic (MZ) twins have theoretically identical nuclear DNA sequences, there may be phenotypic differences between them caused by somatic mutations and epigenetic changes affecting each genome. In this study, we collected eight families of MZ twins discordant for schizophrenia with the aim of investigating the potential role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy in causing the phenotypic differences between the twin pairs. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was used to screen the whole mitochondrial genome of the twin pairs and their parents. The mtDNA heteroplasmy level was found to be nearly identical between the twin pairs but was distinctly different between each mother and their offspring. These results suggest that the discordance of schizophrenia between MZ twins may not be attributable to the difference in mtDNA heteroplasmy, and the high concordance of mtDNA heteroplasmy between MZ twins may indicate the relatively equal distribution of mtDNA during embryo separation of MZ twins and/or the modulation effect from the same nuclear genetic background. Furthermore, we observed an overrepresentation of heteroplasmy in noncoding regions and an elevated ratio of nonsynonymous heteroplasmy, suggesting the possible effects of a purifying selection in shaping the pattern of mtDNA heteroplasmy.",

    "abstract": "Overlapping genetic influences have been implicated in diurnal preference and subjective sleep quality. Our overall aim was to examine overlapping concurrent and longitudinal genetic and environmental effects on diurnal preference and sleep quality over ~5 years. Behavioral genetic analyses were performed on data from the longitudinal British G1219 study of young adult twins and nontwin siblings. A total of 1556 twins and siblings provided data on diurnal preference (Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire) and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) at time 1 (mean age = 20.30 years, SD = 1.76; 62% female), and 862 participated at time 2 (mean age = 25.30 years, SD = 1.81; 66% female). Preference for eveningness was associated with poorer sleep quality at both time points (r = 0.25 [95% confidence intervals {CIs} = 0.20-0.30] and r = 0.21 [CI = 0.15-0.28]). There was substantial overlap in the genetic influences on diurnal preference and sleep quality individually, across time (genetic correlations [rAs]: 0.64 [95% CI = 0.59-0.67] and 0.48 [95% CI = 0.42-.053]). There were moderate genetic correlations between diurnal preference and sleep quality concurrently and longitudinally (rAs = 0.29-0.60). Nonshared environmental overlap was substantially smaller for all cross-phenotype associations (nonshared environmental correlations (rEs) = -0.02 to 0.08). All concurrent and longitudinal associations within and between phenotypes were largely accounted for by genetic factors (explaining between 60% and 100% of the associations). All shared environmental effects were nonsignificant. Nonshared environmental influences played a smaller role on the associations between phenotypes (explaining between -0.06% and 40% of the associations). These results suggest that to some extent, similar genes contribute to the stability of diurnal preference and sleep quality throughout young adulthood but also that different genes play a part over this relatively short time frame. While there was evidence of genetic overlap between phenotypes concurrently and longitudinally, the possible emergence of new genetic factors (or decline of previously associated factors) suggests that molecular genetic studies focusing on young adults should consider more tightly specified age groups, given that genetic effects may be time specific.",

    "abstract": "The feeding behavior in humans is complex, with psychological, social, and cultural factors. This pathology consists of the desire to eat (reinforcement/reward) and the control of the act of eating (inhibitory control). It is well known that blocking post-synaptic D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens induces a decrease of craving behavior. Due to this, to test hypothesis we measured the expression of the DRD2 gene and the expression of the type of feeding factor in a group of Mexican twins.\nIn the study were included 18 pairs of twins (n = 36), reared together (at least up to 18 years old); native to Mexico City; to whom we applied the three factors of food instrument.\nWe observed a significant correlation between the \"uncontrolled\" factor and expression of the DRD2 gene (p < 0.03).\nTherefore, we propose that the expression of the DRD2 gene in subjects is a linkage to the type of feeding factor.",

    "abstract": "Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), which refers to reduced fetal growth in the context of placental insufficiency, is etiologically heterogeneous. IUGR is associated not only with perinatal morbidity and mortality but also with adult-onset disorders, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, posing a major health burden. Placental epigenetic dysregulation has been proposed as one mechanism that causes IUGR; however, the spectrum of epigenetic pathophysiological mechanisms leading to IUGR remains to be elucidated. Monozygotic monochorionic twins are particularly affected by IUGR, in the setting of severe discordant growth. Because monozygotic twins have the same genotype at conception and a shared maternal environment, they provide an ideal model system for studying epigenetic dysregulation of the placenta.\nWe compared genome-wide placental DNA methylation patterns of severely growth-discordant twins to identify novel candidate genes for IUGR. Snap-frozen placental samples for eight severely growth-discordant monozygotic monochorionic twin pairs were obtained at delivery from each twin. A high-resolution DNA methylation array platform was used to identify methylation differences between IUGR and normal twins. Our analysis revealed differentially methylated regions in the promoters of eight genes: DECR1, ZNF300, DNAJA4, CCL28, LEPR, HSPA1A/L, GSTO1, and GNE. The largest methylation differences between the two groups were in the promoters of DECR1 and ZNF300. The significance of these group differences was independently validated by bisulfite pyrosequencing, implicating aberrations in fatty acid beta oxidation and transcriptional regulation, respectively. Further analysis of the array data identified methylation changes most prominently affecting the Wnt and cadherin pathways in the IUGR cohort.\nOur results suggest that IUGR in monozygotic twins is associated with impairments in lipid metabolism and transcriptional regulation as well as cadherin and Wnt signaling. We show that monozygotic monochorionic twins discordant for growth provide a useful model to study one type of the epigenetic placental dysregulation that drives IUGR.",

    "abstract": "The regulatory factors explaining the wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes for mitochondrial 3243A>G mutation are not known. Crosstalk between nuclear genes and mitochondrial DNA might be one factor.\nIn this case series, we compared 2 pairs of male twins with the mitochondrial 3243 A>G mutation and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome with a female control patient. One pair of monozygotic twins presented with diabetes and deafness in their 30s, stroke-like episodes in their 40s, and cardiac events and death in their 50s. Another pair of twins presented with deafness and stroke-like episodes in their 20s. The degree of heteroplasmy of 3243A>G mutation in the various tissues and organs was similar in the first pair of twins compared with the control patient.\nThe clinical phenotype and segregation of mitochondrial 3243A>G mutation was similar in monozygotic twins. The onset age and distribution of the symptoms might be regulated by nuclear genes. Our findings might help to predict the clinical course of the surviving twins and afford an opportunity for therapy before the onset of mitochondrial disease, especially for monozygotic twins caused by nuclear transfer with a small amount of nuclear-donor mitochondrial DNA.",

    "abstract": "A dramatic increase in twin pregnancies has been observed in the past few decades, primarily related to assisted reproductive techniques (ART) and increased average maternal age during pregnancy. Multiple pregnancies, compared to singleton pregnancies, are associated with greater perinatal morbidity and mortality. The present study evaluated the perinatal outcomes of pregnancies with discordant anomalous twins in a tertiary maternity ward in a developing country. Data were retrospectively collected from the Instituto Fernandes Figueira/FIOCRUZ, Brazil between January 2002 and December 2014. We identified 74 twin pregnancies with discordant anomalous twins. Final data analysis was based on 40 pregnancies. Congenital defects were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases: ICD-10: the digestive system was responsible in 27 (34%) cases; the central nervous system was responsible in 18 (22%) cases; the urinary tract was responsible in 14 (17%) cases; and the circulatory system was responsible in 14 (17%) cases. A total of 19 deaths occurred during the study period, and delivery before 30.4 weeks was a significant prediction of fetal death (p = .01). The presence of hydrops in the affected fetus was related to a higher number of deaths in healthy fetuses and contributed to a worse prognosis. The presence of this condition was the cause of 12 (55.6%) deaths in healthy fetuses. A 10 times higher risk of death of a normal co-twin was observed in cases of death of the anomalous twin (p = .002, OR 10.55, 95% CI: 1.9-58.52).",

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether discrepant copy number variations (CNVs) contribute to the risk for discordant congenital anomalies in monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins.\nWe conducted a parallel testing using both G-banding for standard karyotyping and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) with Affymetrix CytoScan HD array in MCDA twins with discordant malformations.\nDuring the study period, 193 MCDA twins with discordant malformations were detected and followed up. Multiple anomalies and cardiac defects were detected most frequently among the fetuses with malformations. Among all the 119 MCDA twins that were successfully performed fetal karyotyping, discordance of chromosomal aberrations were identified in nine cases, including one with discordant trisomy 18, seven with discordant monosomy X, one twin with 47, XXY and the co-twin with 45, X [7]/46, XY[43]. CMA revealed pathological CNVs in four out of the 110 fetuses with normal karyotype and the detection rate of uncertain clinical significance was 3.6% (4/110). Discordance of CNVs was detected in 5.5% (3/55) among the 55 MCDA twins with normal karyotype. Monozygosity was confirmed in all the 61 MCDA twins that were performed CMA.\nLarge whole chromosome abnormalities are more common between discordant twins rather than smaller CNVs in this study. \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the native, citrullinated or carbamylated type II human collagen T cell- and B cell-epitopes on the adaptive immune response in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Peripheral blood T and B cells obtained from a human leucocyte D4-related (antigen DR4(-) HLA-DR4)(+) woman with early RA, her healthy monozygotic twin and an unrelated HLA-DR3(+) woman with early RA were analysed for activation (CD154/CD69), apoptosis (annexin/7-aminoactinomycin), cytokine production [interferon (IFN)\u03b3/interleukin (IL)-17/IL-4/IL-10/IL-6] and functional phenotype (CD45Ra/CCR7) after stimulation with the collagen native T cell epitope (T261-273), the K264 carbamylated T cell epitope (carT261-273), the native B cell epitope (B359-369) or the R360 citrullinated B cell epitope (citB359-369), and the combinations of these. The T cell memory compartment was activated by T cell epitopes in both discordant DR4(+) twins, but not in the DR3(+) RA. The collagen-specific activation of CD4(+) T cells was induced with both the native and carbamylated T cell epitopes only in the RA twin. Both T cell epitopes also induced IL-17 production in the RA twin, but a greater IL-4 and IL-10 response in the healthy twin. The\u00a0citrullinated B cell epitope, particularly when combined with the carbamylated T cell epitope, induced B cell activation and an increased IL-6/IL-10 ratio in the RA twin compared to a greater IL-10 production in the healthy twin. Our data suggest that circulating collagen-specific T and B cells are found in HLA-DR4(+) subjects, but only RA activated cells express co-stimulatory molecules and produce proinflammatory cytokines. Carbamylation and citrullination further modulate the activation and cytokine polarization of T and B cells.",

Characteristically, patients with IgAN have increased serum levels of undergalactosylated IgA1 (gd-IgA1). To assess the degree to which serum gd-IgA1 levels are genetically determined in healthy individuals, we determined serum IgA and gd-IgA1 levels by ELISA in a sample of 148 healthy female twins, including 27 monozygotic and 47 dizygotic pairs. Using the classic twin model, we found the heritability of serum gd-IgA1 and IgA levels to be 80% (95% confidence interval, 66% to 89%) and 46% (95% confidence interval, 15% to 69%), respectively. These data indicate that serum gd-IgA1 levels are highly heritable. Elucidating the genetic basis of this heritability will be important in understanding the pathogenesis of IgAN.",

The clinical presentation is characterized by a multitude and diversity of symptoms and complications. The coexistence of celiac disease with other autoimmune disorders has been established, most frequently with type 1 diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroiditis. The association of celiac disease with immune-mediated hematologic conditions has been rarely reported. This case study describes a pair of identical twin sisters with celiac disease associated with Evans syndrome in one sibling, and with isolated immune thrombocytopenia in the other.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to analyze the perinatal outcome of twin gestations and estimate the influence of chorionicity on the outcome in a large cohort of twin pregnancies in Poland.\nA retrospective analysis of 465 twin deliveries in 6 Polish centers in 2012 was conducted. Baseline characteristics, the course of pregnancy and labor, as well as the neonatal outcome were analyzed in the study group and according to chorionicity.\nA total of 356 twin pregnancies were dichorionic (DC group) (76.6%), and 109 were monochorionic (MC group) (23.4%). There were no differences in the occurrence of pregnancy complications according to chorionicity, except for IUGR of at least one fetus (MC 43.1% vs. DC 34.6%; p = 0.003). 66.5% of the women delivered preterm, significantly more in the MC group (78% vs. 62.9%; p = 0.004). Cesarean delivery was performed in 432 patients (92.9%). Mean neonatal birthweight was statistically lower in the MC group (2074 g vs. 2370 g; p < 0.001). Perinatal mortality of at least one twin was 4.3% (2.8% in the DC group vs. 9.2% in the MC group; p = 0.004). Neonatal complications, including NICU admission, respiratory disorders, and infections requiring antibiotic therapy, were significantly more often observed among the MC twins.\nThe overall perinatal outcome in the presented subpopulation of Polish twins and its dependence on cho-rionicity is similar to the reports in the literature. Nevertheless, the rates of preterm and cesarean deliveries remain higher. It seems that proper counselling of pregnant women and education of obstetricians may result in reduction of these rates.",

    "abstract": "Twins can help researchers disentangle the roles of genes from those of the environment on human traits, health, and diseases. To realize this potential, the Australian Twin Registry (ATR), University of Melbourne, and the Charles Perkins Centre (CPC), University of Sydney, established a collaboration to form the Twins Research Node, a highly interconnected research facility dedicated specifically to research involving twins. This collaboration aims to foster the adoption of twin designs as important tools for research in a range of health-related domains. The CPC hosted their Twins Research Node's launch seminar entitled 'Double the power of your research with twin studies', in which experienced twin researchers described how twin studies are supporting scientific discoveries and careers. The launch also featured twin pairs who have actively participated in research through the ATR. Researchers at the CPC were surveyed before the event to gauge their level of understanding and interest in utilizing twin research. This article describes the new Twins Research Node, discusses the survey's main results and reports on the launch seminar.",

    "abstract": "As patents expire on innovator products, there is increasing interest in developing biosimilar products globally. Biosimilars are not exact copies and are not considered generic versions of the reference product. They may differ in strength, purity and contain different composition of isoforms and/or various glycosylation profiles, with the consequent alterations in clinical efficacy or safety. Recently 2 new recombinant FSH preparations were introduced to clinical practice following randomized controlled, phase 3 clinical trials. Both, Bemfola and Ovaleap\u00ae were referred to the FSH innovator product Gonal-f\u2122 (Follitropin alpha), and were found to yield an equivalent number of oocytes (primary end-point), following a long GnRH agonist suppressive protocol in \"ideal\" patients, i.e., young, normal responders. However, a closer look at these RCTs reveals a non-significant 4\u00a0% difference in clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates, in favor of Gonal f over the biosimilar products, accompanied by half the incidence of OHSS (2.9 vs 5.2\u00a0%, respectively). These studies were underpowered with reference to pregnancy rates, Thus, we believe that further comparative studies are needed in additional patient populations, e.g.,older,, poor responders, patients with repeated IVF failures and/or polycystic ovary syndrome, before the universal implementation of biosimilar products for clinical use. Biosimilars are actually a regulatory synonym, facilitating a fast track introduction of a FSH preparation to the COH armamentarium. We therefore recommend against interchanging or substituting innovator and biosimilar agents in clinical practice, and believe that the decision whether to use an innovator or a biosimilar product, should be reserved to the discretion of the treating physician. Furthermore, we believe the time has come that the measurement of the biological activity of FSH in humans should require other methods rather than the Steelman-Pohley assay, such as the determination of dose-response curves in defined populations of women with well-defined outcomes during COH in preparation for ART.",

    "abstract": "Although monozygotic (MZ) twins share the majority of their genetic makeup, they can be phenotypically discordant on several traits and diseases. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that can be influenced by genetic, environmental and stochastic events and may have an important impact on individual variability. In this study we explored epigenetic differences in peripheral blood samples in three MZ twin studies on major depressive disorder (MDD). Epigenetic data for twin pairs were collected as part of a previous study using 8.1-K-CpG microarrays tagging DNA modification in white blood cells from MZ twins discordant for MDD. Data originated from three geographical regions: UK, Australia and the Netherlands. Ninety-seven MZ pairs (194 individuals) discordant for MDD were included. Different methods to address non independently-and-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data were evaluated. Machine-learning methods with feature selection centered on support vector machine and random forest were used to build a classifier to predict cases and controls based on epivariations. The most informative variants were mapped to genes and carried forward for network analysis. A mixture approach using principal component analysis (PCA) and Bayes methods allowed to combine the three studies and to leverage the increased predictive power provided by the larger sample. A machine-learning algorithm with feature reduction classified affected from non-affected twins above chance levels in an independent training-testing design. Network analysis revealed gene networks centered on the PPAR-\u03b3 (NR1C3) and C-MYC gene hubs interacting through the AP-1 (c-Jun) transcription factor. PPAR-\u03b3 (NR1C3) is a drug target for pioglitazone, which has been shown to reduce depression symptoms in patients with MDD. Using a data-driven approach we were able to overcome challenges of non-i.i.d. data when combining epigenetic studies from MZ twins discordant for MDD. Individually, the studies yielded negative results but when combined classification of the disease state from blood epigenome alone was possible. Network analysis revealed genes and gene networks that support the inflammation hypothesis of MDD.",

    "abstract": "Infantile Systemic Hyalinosis (ISH) is a rare and fatal genetic disorder with mutations in Capillary morphogenesis gene-2 CMG2 / Human anthrax toxin receptor gene-2 ANTXR2 resulting in spindle cell proliferation, altered collagen metabolism with extensive deposition of amorphous eosinophilic PAS positive hyaline material in the connective tissues of various organs. The common presenting features would be progressive stiffness of multiple joints, skin lesions, multiple episodes of protracted infections, prolonged diarrhoea and failure to thrive. ISH is a rapidly progressive painful disorder of infancy with a very short life expectancy.\n3 months old identical twins born to a 5th degree consanguinous couple were brought with complaints of excessive cry, deformity of all four limbs, recurrent episodes of respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea since birth. Evaluation of both the probands revealed facial dysmorphism with perinasal nodules, gingival hypertrophy, fixed deformities of multiple joints bilaterally, umbilical hernia, fleshy perianal nodules and pigmented patches over knuckles and ankle. A clinical diagnosis of ISH was suspected and confirmed by detection of homozygous c.277_278insATTATTT (or p.L93Yfs*14) in exon 3 of the ANTXR2 gene. The probands were managed symptomatically and parents were counselled regarding prenatal diagnosis in future pregnancies.\nIHS is commonly misdiagnosed as Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita and is often mismanaged with manipulation of the stiff joints and invasive surgical procedures. Prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus biopsy is possible once causative mutation in a family is identified. Invasive surgical interventions for histopathological analysis can be avoided as clinical features are most often classical and genetic analysis is confirmatory. Management is conservative and symptomatic. We report this case of identical twins with features of ISH in view of its rarity as timely clinical suspicion can avoid painful and invasive procedures for diagnosis and management.",

Prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus biopsy is possible once causative mutation in a family is identified. Invasive surgical interventions for histopathological analysis can be avoided as clinical features are most often classical and genetic analysis is confirmatory. Management is conservative and symptomatic. We report this case of identical twins with features of ISH in view of its rarity as timely clinical suspicion can avoid painful and invasive procedures for diagnosis and management.",

    "abstract": "Smaller observational studies have suggested familial clustering of mitral regurgitation (MR). Using a large twin cohort, the aims were to assess MR concordance rates and assess mortality in MR twins and unaffected cotwins.\nThrough the Danish Twin Registry, twins with an International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision and Tenth Revision diagnosis code of MR born 1880-1989 were identified and proband-wise concordance rates were calculated. To assess whether having a cotwin with MR affected survival, 10 matched twins without MR (n = 5,575) were selected for each MR twin (n = 562), and all-cause mortality rates were assessed.\nAmong the 87,432 twins alive January 1, 1977, or later, 494 (0.57%) MR individuals were identified. Six MR concordant pairs were found, of which 3 were monozygotic. Proband-wise concordance rate when accounting for right censoring and competing risk of death was 0.12 (95% CI 0.04-0.32) for monozygotic twins and 0.03 (95% CI 0.01-0.09) for dizygotic twins. Mortality was significantly higher among the affected twins with MR within discordant twin pairs where both were alive at the date of MR diagnosis (sex-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.57, 95% CI 1.86-3.54). Overall there was no increased mortality risk for unaffected cotwins to MR cases compared with matched controls (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90-1.17) except for first year of life (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.10-3.36) and for monozygotic twins older than 65 years (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.07-2.08).\nAlthough there is a familial aggregation of MR, the absolute risk is low, even for monozygotic cotwins to affected twins. The study found increased mortality in MR twins compared with their unaffected cotwins. Overall no excess mortality was observed in the unaffected cotwins except for first year of life and for monozygotic cotwins older than 65 years.",

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin A (IgA), the major class of antibody secreted by the gut mucosa, is an important contributor to gut barrier function. The repertoire of IgA bound to gut bacteria reflects both T-cell-dependent and -independent pathways, plus glycans present on the antibody's secretory component. Human gut bacterial taxa targeted by IgA in the setting of barrier dysfunction are capable of producing intestinal pathology when isolated and transferred to gnotobiotic mice. A complex reorientation of gut immunity occurs as infants transition from passively acquired IgA present in breast milk to host-derived IgA. How IgA responses co-develop with assembly of the microbiota during this period remains poorly understood. Here, we (1) identify a set of age-discriminatory bacterial taxa whose representations define a program of microbiota assembly and maturation during the first 2 postnatal years that is shared across 40 healthy twin pairs in the USA; (2) describe a pattern of progression of gut mucosal IgA responses to bacterial members of the microbiota that is highly distinctive for family members (twin pairs) during the first several postnatal months then generalizes across pairs in the second year; and (3) assess the effects of zygosity, birth mode, and breast feeding. Age-associated differences in these IgA responses can be recapitulated in young germ-free mice, colonized with faecal microbiota obtained from two twin pairs at 6 and 18 months of age, and fed a sequence of human diets that simulate the transition from milk feeding to complementary foods. Most of these responses were robust to diet, suggesting that 'intrinsic' properties of community members play a dominant role in dictating IgA responses. The approach described can be used to define gut mucosal immune development in health and disease states and to help discover ways of repairing or preventing perturbations in this facet of host immunity.",

    "abstract": "To describe the establishment of a Danish inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) twin cohort with focus on concordance of treatment and inflammatory markers.\nWe identified MZ twins, likely to be discordant or concordant for IBD, by merging information from the Danish Twin Register and the National Patient Register. The twins were asked to provide biological samples, questionnaires, and data access to patient files and public registries. Biological samples were collected via a mobile laboratory, which allowed for immediate centrifugation, fractionation, and storage of samples. The mean time from collection of samples to storage in the -80\u2005\u00b0C mobile freezer was less than one hour. The diagnoses where validated using the Copenhagen diagnostic criteria.\nWe identified 159 MZ IBD twin pairs, in a total of 62 (39%) pairs both twins agreed to participate. Of the supposed 62 IBD pairs, the IBD diagnosis could be confirmed in 54 pairs. The cohort included 10 concordant pairs, whereof some were discordant for either treatment or surgery. The 10 concordant pairs, where both pairs suffered from IBD, included eight CD/CD pairs, one UC/UC pair and one UC/IBDU pair. The discordant pairs comprised 31 UC, 5 IBDU (IBD unclassified), and 8 CD discordant pairs. In the co-twins not affected by IBD, calprotectin was above 100 \u03bcg/g in 2 participants, and above 50 \u03bcg/g in a further 5 participants.\nThe presented IBD twin cohorts are an excellent resource for bioinformatics studies with proper adjustment for disease-associated exposures including medication and inflammatory activity in the co-twins.",

The associations between the absolute values of AnisoSR, AnisoAST and AnisoSE with SR, AST, SE, corneal refractive power (CR), corneal astigmatism (CAST), anterior chamber depth (ACD) and axial length (AL) and with their interocular differences were calculated. When calculating the interdependencies of the differences, the real and absolute differences between the right and left eye were used.\nMeans\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviations for AnisoSR, AnisoAST and AnisoSE were 0.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.92 D, 0.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.41 D and 0.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.71 D, respectively. AnisoSR, AnisoAST and AnisoSE >1.0 D were present in 14.7%, 4.2% and 17.7% of cases, respectively. Anisometropia of spherical refraction (AnisoSR), AnisoAST and AnisoSE were higher the more negative the values of SR or SE. Hyperopic ametropia did not increase these anisometropia values. The correlations of AnisoSR and AnisoSE with the absolute values of interocular differences in CR and AL were non-significant. Using the real values of the interocular differences, the respective correlations were significant. The correlation between the real interocular differences in CR and AL was negative (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.258, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Thus, the combined effect of the real interocular differences in CR and AL was a decrease in AnisoSR and AnisoSE (emmetropization).\nHigher AnisoSR and AnisoSE were associated with more myopic refraction and longer AL. Higher AnisoAST was associated with more negative SR and higher AST and CAST. The negative correlation between real interocular differences in CR and AL indicated their influence of emmetropization in AnisoSR and AnisoSE.",

    "abstract": "Intervention programs with the aim of enhancing parenting quality have been found to be differentially effective in decreasing negative child outcomes such as externalizing behavioral problems, resulting in modest overall effect sizes. Here we present the protocol for a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of the Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline for Twin Families (VIPP-Twins) on parenting quality and children's behavioral control and social competence. In addition, we aim to test the differential susceptibility theory; we examine differential efficacy of the intervention based on genetic make-up or temperament for both parents and children. Lastly, we explore neurobiological mechanisms underlying intervention effects on children's developmental outcomes.\nThe original VIPP-SD was adapted for use in families with twins. The VIPP-Twins consists of five biweekly sessions in which the families are visited at home, parent-child interactions are videotaped and parents receive positive feedback on selected video fragments. Families (N\u2009=\u2009225) with a same sex twin (mean age\u2009=\u20093.6\u00a0years) were recruited to participate in the study. The study consists of four assessments. After two baseline assessments in year 1 and year 2, a random 40\u00a0% of the sample will receive the VIPP-Twins program. The first post-test assessment will be carried out one month after the intervention and there will be a long term follow-up assessment two years after the intervention. Measures include observational assessments of parenting and children's social competence and behavioral control, and neurobiological assessments (i.e., hormonal functioning and neural (re-)activity).\nResults of the study will provide insights in the efficacy of the VIPP-Twins and reveal moderators and mediators of program efficacy. Overall the randomized controlled trial is an experimental test of the differential susceptibility theory.\nDutch Trial Register: NTR5312 ; Date registered: July 20, 2015.",

    "abstract": "To examine the relationship between the inner cell mass (ICM) grade and its morphological configuration on the occurrence of monochorionic diamniotic (M-D) twinning.\nRetrospective embryo cohort study.\nPrivate IVF clinic.\nEvaluation of frozen-thawed single blastocyst transfers with hormone replacement treatment in 8,435. This cohort included 71 blastocysts and their ICMs observed by time-lapse photography.\nAny changes in configuration of the ICMs observed by time-lapse photography were analyzed retrospectively.\nThe amount of loosening of blastomeres within the ICM was evaluated by time-lapse observations. The number of cells that were involved in the loosening process was also assessed. Both of these parameters were correlated with the type of monozygotic twinning that eventuated.\nThe M-D twinning incidence resulting from blastocysts with a high grade ICM (grade A) were transferred was 0.38% (3/796), whereas it was significantly higher, 1.38% (34/2,463), when blastocysts with a poorer (B and C) grade ICM were transferred. Among 71 transferred frozen-thawed blastocysts that were studied with time-lapse photography, there were two dichorionic diamniotic and one M-D twins. Careful observations of the embryo that resulted in the one M-D case, revealed that the ICM acquired a looser appearance due to decompaction of at least eight cells. This type of decompaction was not observed in the ICMs of other transferred blastocysts.\nThe occurrence of M-D twinning may be avoided by excluding blastocysts that contain decompacting ICMs.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional nature of twins, especially the atomic structures and motion mechanisms of the boundary lateral to the shear direction of the twin, has never been characterized at the atomic level, because such boundary is, in principle, crystallographically unobservable. We thus refer to it here as the dark side of the twin. Here, using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and atomistic simulations, we characterize the dark side of deformation twins in magnesium. It is found that the dark side is serrated and comprised of coherent twin boundaries and semi-coherent twist prismatic-prismatic boundaries that control twin growth. The conclusions of this work apply to the same twin mode in other hexagonal close-packed materials, and the conceptual ideas discussed here should hold for all twin modes in crystalline materials.",

It is proved that the adaptation of the newborn with multiple pregnancy depends on the type of placentation. It is found that monozygotic twins is a risk factor syndromes disadaptation. Children from monozygotic twins compared with dizygotic twins have a higher frequency of the syndrome of respiratory disorders, and more prone to jaundice, hemorrhagic syndrome, violation gemolikvorodinamics II and III degrees. The physical development of the twins also determined by the type zygosity. In the group of monozygotic twins are more common heavier versions of intrauterine growth retardation - hypoplastic and dysplastic. The high frequency of asphyxia on the background of immaturity that leads to the development disadaptation syndromes in these children, the most common of which are hypoxic-ischemic CNS disorders, thermoregulation, jaundice and gastrointestinal reactions. Detection disorders of blood coagulation and glucose metabolism certainly play a negative role in the development of adaptation of these newborns. zygosity type must be determined at the time of pregnancy to produce medical tactics and prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Increased incidence of congenital heart disease (CHD) has been reported in the offspring of monochorionic twin gestations. Assisted reproductive technology (ART), which is related to increased rates of twinning, has also been associated with higher risk of birth defects. We studied the incidence of CHD in a cohort of twins to clarify the contribution of type of conception and chorionicity.\nData concerning 874 live-born twins of which at least one was admitted in our Neonatal Unit during 1995-2012 were analysed. Forty-five % (N=197) of the gestations resulted from ART (in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm insertion).\nIn the ART group 32/389 (8.2%) had CHD compared to 21/485 (4.3%) infants conceived naturally (OR 1.90, 95%CI 1.08-3.34, p=0.024). Spontaneous-conception gestations had higher incidence of monochorionic placentation (47/245 versus 4/197, p<0.001), and included younger mothers (29.1\u00b15.2 versus 33.9\u00b15.5years, p<0.001) who had higher parity (median 2 [range 1-7] versus 1 Pinborg (2005), Blondel and Kaminski (2002), Knopman et al. (2014), Kyvik and Derom (2006) ; p<0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that ART (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.24-5.45) and monochorionicity (OR 3.49, 95% CI 1.57-7.77) were significant determinants of CHD, independently of maternal age, parity, and the gender of the offspring.\nWe confirmed that monochorionic twins have increased risk of CHD and we documented a higher incidence of CHD in ART twins independently of chorionicity. We suggest improvement of echocardiographic skills of health care professionals involved in prenatal screening and foetal cardiology referral of ART dichorionic twins with suspicious findings at screening, in addition to all monochorionic gestations.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is common in both children and adults in the Western world, just like anxiety and depression. While some research has revealed that these diseases might share important environmental and pathophysiological aspects, the exact mechanisms still remain unclear.\nTo study the correlation firstly between depression or anxiety and asthma diagnosis in adult twins and secondly the association between parental depression or anxiety and offspring asthma in children of twins.\nIn total, 24\u00a0685 adult twins aged 20-47\u00a0years were interviewed or completed a Web-based questionnaire and their children were identified through the Multi-Generation Register. Asthma diagnosis was obtained from the Patient Register and the Prescribed Drug Register. Assessment of depression and anxiety was obtained from questionnaires using Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), major depression and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) from DSM-IV. The association between depression or anxiety and asthma was analyzed with logistic regression adjusting for confounders in twins and offspring. To address genetic and familial environmental confounding, we performed a cotwin analysis using disease-discordant twin pairs.\nWe found an association between asthma and CES-D, major depression and GAD, for example adjusted OR for major depression and register-based asthma 1.56 (1.36-1.79). Most of the point estimates remained in the co-twin control analysis, indicating that the association was likely not due to genetic or familial environmental factors. There was no association between parental depression and/or anxiety and asthma diagnosis in the offspring which implies lack of genetic confounding.\nWe found an association between own asthma diagnosis and anxiety or depression, but not with offspring asthma. Our results indicate that the associations were not due to confounding from genes or environment shared by the twins.",

    "abstract": "This is the first longitudinal twin study examining genetic and environmental contributions to the association between liability to bipolar disorder (BD) and changes over time in global brain volumes, and global and regional measures of cortical surface area, cortical thickness and cortical volume. A total of 50 twins from pairs discordant or concordant for BD (monozygotic: 8 discordant and 3 concordant pairs, and 1 patient and 3 co-twins from incomplete pairs; dizygotic: 6 discordant and 2 concordant pairs, and 1 patient and 7 co-twins from incomplete pairs) underwent magnetic resonance imaging twice. In addition, 57 twins from healthy twin pairs (15 monozygotic and 10 dizygotic pairs, and 4 monozygotic and 3 dizygotic subjects from incomplete pairs) were also scanned twice. Mean follow-up duration for all twins was 7.5 years (standard deviation: 1.5 years). Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling software OpenMx. The liability to BD was not associated with global or regional structural brain changes over time. Although we observed a subtle increase in cerebral white matter in BD patients, this effect disappeared after correction for multiple comparisons. Heritability of brain changes over time was generally low to moderate. Structural brain changes appear to follow similar trajectories in BD patients and healthy controls. Existing brain abnormalities in BD do not appear to progressively change over time, but this requires additional confirmation. Further study with large cohorts is recommended to assess genetic and environmental influences on structural brain abnormalities in BD, while taking into account the influence of lithium on the brain.",

    "abstract": "Almost 100% individuals with coeliac disease (CD) are carriers of the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2/DQ8 alleles. Earlier studies have, however, failed to consider the HLA system when estimating heritability in CD, thus violating an underlying assumption of heritability analysis. We examined the heritability of CD in a large population-based sample of twins, considering HLA.\nIn a population-representative sample of 107\u2005912 twins, we identified individuals with CD (equal to villous atrophy) through biopsy reports from all Swedish pathology departments. We calculated concordance rates and tetrachoric correlations for monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. Further, we estimated heritability of CD, first strictly from observed data, and then the non-HLA heritability, representing the heritability of all genetic factors except the HLA locus, using an approach that circumvent the violation of underlying assumptions.\nWe identified 513 twins with a diagnosis of CD (prevalence 0.48%). Concordance rates were higher in MZ pairs (0.49) than in DZ pairs (0.10), as were tetrachoric correlations (0.89 in MZ vs 0.51 in DZ pairs). The heritability of CD was 75% (95% CI 55% to 96%). The non-HLA heritability was slightly attenuated, 68% (95% CI 40% to 96%), with shared (17%) and non-shared (15%) environmental factors explaining the remaining variability of CD.\nCD is characterised by a high heritability, but our study also suggests that non-shared environmental factors may be of importance to CD development. HLA seems to have only moderate impact on heritability estimates.",

Laryngeal anomalies are not a common feature of this syndrome. We describe newly born twins who presented with unexpected severe birth depression secondary to severe type IV glottic webs requiring extensive resuscitation and emergency tracheostomy. They were diagnosed postnatally to have deletion of 22q11.2. The successful resuscitation of these infants at birth was only possible because they were born in a tertiary care hospital. This report shows the critical nature of prenatal diagnosis of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Research indicates that parents of twins have poorer psychosocial outcomes than parents of singletons. Parents who have conceived using assisted reproductive technology (ART) have been found to be at higher risk of negative psychosocial outcomes compared to parents who have conceived spontaneously. The current study aimed to model the factors associated with parenting stress of newly-born twins, using the Transactional Model of Stress.\nData were collected using a cross-sectional survey design with participants identified from delivery records across Northern Ireland. Mothers and fathers (n\u2009=\u2009104) of twins aged between 1 and 12 months old returned a questionnaire pack containing the Parenting Stress Index, Impact on the Family Scale-Financial Burden, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced - Brief Version, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, General Health Questionnaire and a demographic questionnaire.\nThere were no differences on psychological outcomes between parents who had conceived via ART and those who conceived spontaneously. Regression analyses found that social interaction and support is an important variable in terms of the psychological outcomes experienced by parents of twins.\nParents of newly-born twins regardless of the mode of conception should be considered an at risk group for parental distress. Support groups such as the Twins and Multiple Births Association could be important in providing that crucial social interaction and support that seems to be important in the emotional well-being of parents of twins.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition in preterm infants. Neonatal microbiota plays a pivotal role in the immune system maturation. Changes in gut microbiota have been associated to inflammatory disorders; however, a link with sepsis in the neonatal period has not yet been established. We aimed to analyze gut microbiota and mucosal gene expression using non-invasively obtained samples to provide with an integrative perspective of host-microbe interactions in neonatal sepsis. For this purpose, a prospective observational case-control study was conducted in septic preterm dizygotic twins and their non-septic twin controls. Fecal samples were used for both microbiota analysis and host genome-wide expression using exfoliated intestinal cells. Gene expression of exfoliated intestinal cells in septic preterm showed an induction of inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways in the gut and pro-oxidant profile that caused dysbiosis in the gut microbiota with predominance of Enterobacteria and reduction of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium spp.in fecal samples, leading to a global reduction of beneficial anaerobic bacteria. Sepsis in preterm infants induced low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress in the gut mucosa, and also changes in the gut microbiota. This study highlights the role of inflammation and oxidative stress in neonatal sepsis on gut microbial profiles.",

Only the monozygotic twins presented IgG antibodies against both Dsg1 and Dsg3. According to our knowledge based on a review of published literature on the topic, this is the first report of PV affecting monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Studies in mice and humans have revealed intriguing associations between host genetics and the microbiome. Here we report a 16S rRNA-based analysis of the gut microbiome in 1,126 twin pairs, a subset of which was previously reported. Tripling the sample narrowed the confidence intervals around heritability estimates and uncovered additional heritable taxa, some of which are validated in other studies. Repeat sampling of subjects showed heritable taxa to be temporally stable. A candidate gene approach uncovered associations between heritable taxa and genes related to diet, metabolism, and olfaction. We replicate an association between Bifidobacterium and the lactase (LCT) gene locus and identify an association between the host gene ALDH1L1 and the bacteria SHA-98, suggesting a link between formate production and blood pressure. Additional genes detected are involved in barrier defense and self/non-self recognition. Our results indicate that diet-sensing, metabolism, and immune defense are\u00a0important drivers of human-microbiome co-evolution.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of a discordant chromosomal abnormality in monozygotic twins is an extremely rare condition.\nWe report the prenatal sonographic findings and cytogenetic studies in a monochorionic twin pregnancy discordant for severe fetal anomalies. Amniocentesis was normal for both twins. The pregnancy was managed conservatively, resulting in the delivery of discordant twins at 28 weeks. Cytogenetic analysis performed on cultured lymphocytes from peripheral blood revealed a mosaic 47XY+21 (in 2% of the cells)/46XY (in 98%) in the structurally normal twin, and a mosaic 47XY+21 (4%)/46XY (96%) for the abnormal twin. The abnormal neonate died shortly after delivery. The structurally normal twin survived without sequelae and had a normal karyotype 2 years later.\nThis report adds to the literature a case of a monochorionic twin pregnancy with a mosaic fetus who gives his co-twin trisomic cells through placental vascular anastomoses, this twin being a chimera, highlighting the necessity of performing molecular genetics with polymorphic DNA markers to differentiate chimerism from mosaicism and define the origin of cell lines.",

The exposure was chronic LBP and the outcomes were myocardial infarction and other coronary heart diseases-lifetime and in the last 2 years-based on standardized health-related questionnaires. First, logistic regression analysis investigated associations of the total sample followed by a matched co-twin control analyses, with all complete twin pairs discordant for chronic LBP utilised, separated for zygosity-dizygotic (DZ) and monozygotic (MZ) pairs, which adjusted for shared familial factors, including genetics.\nChronic LBP pain is associated with lifetime myocardial infarction [odds ratio (OR) = 2.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.35-5.36], other coronary heart diseases over a lifetime (OR = 2.58, 95% CI: 1.69-3.93) and in the last two years (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.33-3.60), while there was a borderline association with myocardial infarction in the last 2 years (OR = 2.64, 95% CI: 0.98-7.12). Although the magnitude of the association remained or increased in the co-twin control analyses, none reached statistical significance.\nChronic LBP is associated with a higher prevalence of myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease. It is possible that this association remains even when controlling for genetics and early shared environment, although this should be investigated with larger samples of twins discordant for LBP.",

    "abstract": "Prior studies have reported on the pregnancies and outcomes of in vitro fertilization (IVF) in special subpopulations; however, there is a lack of studies on opioid-exposed IVF-conceived neonates.\nA young adult IVF-pregnant woman was maintained on buprenorphine throughout pregnancy and received follow-up from the addiction clinic from estimated gestational week 32. She delivered healthy dichorionic twins via cesarean section at 38 weeks gestational age (buprenorphine dose at time of delivery: 16 mg). All maternal supervised urinalysis taken as of gestational week 32 were negative for concomitant substances (prior to treatment initiation at the addiction clinic, only self-reports of abstinence from concomitant substances were available). Both healthy children (male birth weight: 3140\u00a0g, female birth weight: 2650 g) developed an unusual course of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) requiring extensive treatment (total morphine dose male: 22\u00a0mg, and female: 26.75 mg; length of treatment: 33 and 34\u00a0days, respectively; duration of hospitalization: 40 days).\nThe highly severe and long-lasting NAS in both neonates represents a very unusual course following an uneventful pregnancy, and influencing iatrogenic factors cannot be ruled out. Given the multiple variables influencing infant outcomes, this highlights the importance of high-quality, evidence-based standard operating procedures, which (1) are initiated as early as possible during pregnancy to minimize risk factors for adverse infant outcomes, such as concomitant substance use during pregnancy; (2) support the substance-dependent woman throughout the postpartum period, especially in cases of multiple and/or IVF-conceived pregnancies, where additional challenges may arise; and (3) consider the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this meta-analysis is to provide new evidence on the effects on maternal health of multiple births due to assisted reproductive technology (ART). A bibliographic search was undertaken using PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Science Direct. Data extraction was completed using Cochrane Review recommendations, and the review was performed following PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Meta-analytic data were analysed using random effects models. Eight papers (2993 mothers) were included. Mothers of ART multiple births were significantly more likely to experience depression (standardized mean difference [SMD] d = 0.198, 95% CI 0.050 - 0.345, z = 2.623, P = 0.009; heterogeneity I(2) = 36.47%), and stress (SMD d = 0.177, 95% CI 0.049 - 0.305, P = 0.007; heterogeneity I(2) = 0.01%) than mothers of ART singletons. No difference in psychosocial distress (combined stress and depression) (SMD d = 0.371, 95% CI -0.153 - 0.895; I(2) = 86.962%, P = 0.001) or depression (d = 0.152, 95% CI -0.179 - 0.483: z = 0.901; I(2) = 36.918%) were found between mothers of ART and naturally conceived multiple births. In conclusion, mothers of ART multiple births were significantly more likely to have depression and stress than mothers of ART singletons, but were no different from mothers of naturally conceived multiples.",

    "abstract": "Cephalopagus is a rare variety of conjoined twins. They are fused with their heads, thoracic and upper abdominal cavities. The exact mechanism for development of conjoined twins cannot be clearly explained. It appears that there is an alteration in the normal developmental process of monozygotic twins, which fail to separate from each other. We present the morphology of a cephalothoracopagus, revealed through anatomical dissection, emphasizing the arrangement of the viscera in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. They are fused with their heads, thoracic and upper abdominal cavities. The lower abdomen and pelvic cavities are free. Each twin has two upper and lower limbs, normally shaped. Each twin has a heart and two lungs. There is a single pharynx, esophagus and stomach, but normal lower abdominal systems. The genital and urinary systems are apparently normal. Due to the fusion of the heads and abnormal arrangement of the superior central nervous system, surgery is not attempted in these cases, the prognosis being very poor.",

    "abstract": "Bisphosphonates (BP) are sometimes used in children and young women, but their use requires expertise and caution due to the relative lack of long-term efficacy and safety data.\nWe report on two dizygotic male twins with a past of mild prematurity who presented at the age of 2 months with moderate clinical craniotabes, hypophosphatemia, normal circulating calcium, severe hypercalciuria, and low parathyroid hormone levels. Following supplementation with oral phosphorus and native vitamin D, the clinical and biological abnormalities disappeared within 2 months. Since the twins were dizygotic and were identical in terms of clinical presentation and progression, the only likely explanation for these transient mineral abnormalities was prenatal or neonatal exposure to a toxic agent. Taking into account their medical past, two drugs were possibly involved: either oral alendronate that their mother had received before pregnancy for misdiagnosed osteoporosis or antireflux medications, or both.\nWe believe that these two cases could correspond to the first description of a potential mother-to-fetus transmission of alendronate, inducing early and transient hypophosphatemic rickets, the clinical picture being worsened by the antireflux drugs impairing intestinal phosphate absorption. For pediatric rheumatologists, this raises the question of more clearly defining the indications for BP in female children and teenagers; for rheumatologists, this also demonstrates the importance of correctly diagnosing osteoporosis and not using BP off-label, especially in women of child-bearing age.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) is one of the major components of human body composition, with deviations from normal values often leading to sarcopenia.\nOur major aim was to conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation study in an attempt to identify potential genomic regions associated with SMM.\nThis was a mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal study.\nCommunity-based study.\nA total of 1550 middle-aged United Kingdom twins (monozygotic [MZ] and dizygotic [DZ]), 297 of which were repeatedly measured participated in the study.\nAppendicular lean mass assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry technology, and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing DNA methylation profiling genome-wide were obtained from each individual.\nHeritability estimate of SMM, with simultaneous adjustment for covariates obtained using variance decomposition analysis, was h(2) = 0.809 \u00b1 0.050. After quality control and analysis of longitudinal stability, the DNA methylation data comprised of 723 029 genomic sites, with positive correlations between repeated measurements (Rrepeated = 0.114-0.905). Correlations between MZ and DZ twins were 0.51 and 0.38 at a genome-wide average, respectively, and clearly increased with Rrepeated. Testing for DNA methylation association with SMM in 50 discordant MZ twins revealed 36 081 nominally significant results, of which the top-ranked 134 signals (P < .01 and Rrepeated > 0.40) were subjected to replication in the sample of 1196 individuals. Seven SMM methylation association signals replicated at a false discovery rate less than 0.1, and these were located in or near genes DNAH12, CAND1, CYP4F29P, and ZFP64, which have previously been highlighted in muscle-related studies. Adjusting for age, smoking, and blood cell heterogeneity did not alter significance of these associations.\nThis epigenome-wide study, testing longitudinally stable methylation sites, discovered and replicated a number of associations between DNA methylation at CpG loci and SMM. Four replicated signals were related to genes with potential muscle functions, suggesting that the methylome of whole blood may be informative of SMM variation.",

    "abstract": "To study whether persistent leisure-time physical activity (PA) during adulthood predicts use of antidepressants later in life.\nThe Finnish Twin Cohort comprises same-sex twin pairs born before 1958, of whom 11 325 individuals answered PA questions in 1975, 1981 and 1990 at a mean age of 44 years (range 33-60). PA volume over 15-years was used as the predictor of subsequent use of antidepressants. Antidepressant use (measured as number of purchases) for 1995-2004 were collected from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution (KELA) prescription register. Conditional logistic regression was conducted to calculate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the use of antidepressants in pairs discordant for PA (642, including 164 monozygotic (MZ) pairs).\nAltogether 229 persons had used at least one prescribed antidepressant during the study period. Active co-twins had a lower risk (unadjusted OR 0.80, 95%CI 0.67-0.95) for using any amount of antidepressants than their inactive co-twins; trends being similar for DZ (0.80, 0.67-0.97) and MZ pairs (0.78, 0.51-1.17). The lowest odds ratio (0.51, 0.26-0.98) was seen among MZ pairs after adjusting for BMI, smoking and binge drinking. The point estimates were similar but non-significant for long-term antidepressant use (4+purchases equivalent to 12 months use).\nSelf-reported physical activity and low number of discordant MZ pairs.\nUse of antidepressants was less common among physically active co-twins even when shared childhood experiences and genetic background were controlled for. Physical activity in midlife may therefore be important in preventing mild depression later in life.",

In both cohorts, cord blood was collected at delivery.\nA total of 92 twin pairs were enrolled (n = 49 in Cohort 1; n = 43 in Cohort 2). In Cohort 1, the concentrations of adiponectin (median, 68.5 ng/mL vs 61.4 ng/mL; p<0.05) and leptin (median, 13.9 ng/mL vs 11.2 ng/mL; p<0.1) in mid-trimester AF were significantly higher in smaller compared with larger twins. In Cohort 2, the concentration of serpin E1 (median, 246.0 ng/mL vs 182.8 ng/mL; p<0.01) in AF at delivery was significantly higher in smaller twins, but no difference was noted in adiponectin and leptin concentrations. Levels of adiponectin (median, 10425.5 ng/mL vs 11552.0 ng/mL; p<0.005) and leptin (median, 2.1 ng/mL vs 2.6 ng/mL; p<0.005) were significantly lower in the cord blood of smaller twins whereas cord blood concentrations of serpin E1 (median, 15.5 ng/mL vs 13.3 ng/mL; p<0.05) was higher in the smaller twins.\nIn discordant DCDA twin pairs, concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, and serpin E1 in mid-trimester AF, AF at delivery, and cord blood at birth vary significantly but predictably between the smaller and larger twins.",

    "abstract": "Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) are highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the diagnostic accuracy of ACPA in the general population has not been thoroughly assessed. We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ACPA for RA in the general population and to further characterise the citrullinated peptide recognition pattern.\nSerum samples from a large population-representative twin cohort consisting of 12\u2005590 individuals were analysed for the presence of ACPA using anti-CCP2 ELISA. All ACPA-positive samples were further tested on ELISAs for four peptide-specific ACPA. RA cases were identified by linkage to the Swedish National Patient Register at inclusion and after a median follow-up of 37\u2005months (IQR 31-49).\n350 out of 12\u2005590 individuals had a positive anti-CCP2 test, measuring ACPA. Of these, 103 had an RA diagnosis at the time of blood donation and inclusion. During a median follow-up of 3\u2005years, an additional 21 of the remaining 247 ACPA-positive individuals developed RA. Overall, a positive anti-CCP2 test had a positive predictive value of 29% for prevalent RA at inclusion (negative predictive value of 99.6%). High titres (>3\u00d7 cut-off) of anti-CCP2 increased the positive predictive value to 48% (negative predictive value of 99.5%). ACPA-positive individuals without RA had lower anti-CCP2 titres and fewer peptide-specific ACPA than ACPA-positive patients with RA and higher C reactive protein levels than ACPA-negative individuals without RA.\nPresence of ACPA and especially high titres of anti-CCP2 have a high diagnostic accuracy for an RA diagnosis in a population setting.",

    "abstract": "Monoamniotic twins are considered a cause of high-risk pregnancies. Thereby, discordant malformations do occur rarely. A discordant exencephaly has been described in only a few cases. Transcervical embryoscopy can be performed in cases of monoamniotic twins with missed abortion directly before the abort-curettage.\nThe case of a 35-year-old G1/P0 women in the 12(th) week of pregnancy is described. She had a monoamniotic twin pregnancy with discordant exencephaly and missed abortion diagnosed at 11+2 weeks. A transcervical embryoscopy was performed immediately before the abort-curettage and identified the discordant exencephaly and an additional umbilical cord knot of the 2 foetuses as a probable cause for the abortion.\nThe transcervical embryoscopy lead in our case report to the diagnosis of a umbilical cord knot in a monoamniotic twin pregnancy with missed abortion. We also identified a discordant exencephaly by embryoscopy. With blunt access to the amniotic cavity, the transcervical embryoscopy applies only a minor additional risk to the abort-curettage. However, it should only be performed when the patient explicitly asks for enhanced diagnostics.\nTranscervical embryoscopy can be performed as an additional diagnostic tool in cases of monoamniotic twins with missed abortion. However, a detailed risk-benefit analysis should be done upfront in consultation with the patient.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of congenital scoliosis and its development remains unclear and has not yet been fully identified, even there are theories that congenital scoliosis could be derived from the failure of formation or failure of segmentation, which are etiologically heterogeneous with genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors contributing to their occurrence. We reported a case of long-term follow-up after posterior vertebral column resection (PVCR) in both identical twins with similar congenital kyphoscoliosis at thoracolumbar levels. Twin I had been noticed by his parents to have asymmetry of his back at age 5 years, but no treatment was given. Twin II was first noticed to have a spinal problem at 11 years of age by his parents. Overtime, spine of both twins became further deviated to the left with kyphosis and was referred to our hospital. Both monozygotic twins were treated by PVCR and satisfactory results were demonstrated at 10-year follow-up.This case is the first report on the surgical treatment with PVCR, almost simultaneously, in both identical twins who had similar congenital vertebral anomalies causing kyphoscoliosis. Both identical twins with congenital kyphoscoliosis had undergone surgical correction by PVCR, anterior support with a mesh cage and posterior fusion using pedicle screws at the age of 14 years and achieved a satisfactory correction and a stable spine without curve progression with 10-year follow-up.",

    "abstract": "We examined the debated link between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation and multiple sclerosis (MS) using 49 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs clinically discordant for MS, which enables to associate de novo mtDNA variants, skewed heteroplasmy, and mtDNA copy number with MS manifestation. Ultra-deep sequencing of blood-derived mtDNA revealed 25 heteroplasmic variants with potentially pathogenic features in 18 pairs. All variants were pair-specific and had low and/or similar heteroplasmy levels in both cotwins. In one pair, a confirmed pathogenic variant (m.11778G>A, heteroplasmy \u223c50%) associated with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy was detected. Detailed diagnostic investigation revealed subclinical MS signs in the prior nondiseased cotwin. Moreover, neither mtDNA deletions nor copy-number variations were involved. Furthermore, the majority of heteroplasmic variants were shared among MZ twins and exhibited more similar heteroplasmy levels in the same tissue of MZ twins as compared with different tissues of the same individual. Heteroplasmy levels were also more similar within MZ twins compared with nonidentical siblings. Our analysis excludes mtDNA variation as a major driver of the discordant clinical manifestation of MS in MZ twins, and provides valuable insights into the occurrence and distribution of heteroplasmic variants within MZ twins and nonidentical siblings, and across different tissues.",

Substitution mutations with exchange of arginine at codon 137 can cause nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis or congenital X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. We present a novel mutation in codon 137 within AVPR2 with substitution of glycine for arginine in male dizygotic twins. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus was demonstrated by water deprivation test and resistance to vasopressin administration. While a similar urine exosome release rate was shown between probands and controls by western blotting for the marker ALIX, there was a selective decrease in exosome aquaporin-2 versus aquaporin-1 protein in probands compared to controls.",

    "abstract": "Use of cigarettes and cannabis frequently co-occurs. We examine the role of genetic and environmental influences on variation in and covariation between tobacco cigarette and cannabis use across European-American (EA) and African-American (AA) women.\nData on lifetime cannabis and cigarette use were drawn from interviews of 956 AA and 3557 EA young adult female twins and non-twin same sex female full siblings. Twin modeling was used to decompose variance in and covariance between cigarette and cannabis use into additive genetic, shared, special twin and non-shared environmental sources.\nCigarette use was more common in EAs (75.3%, 95% C.I. 73.8-76.7%) than AAs (64.2%, 95% C.I. 61.2-67.2%) while cannabis use was marginally more commonly reported by AAs (55.5%, 95% C.I. 52.5-58.8%) than EAs (52.4%, 95% C.I. 50.7-54.0%). Additive genetic factors were responsible for 43-66% of the variance in cigarette and cannabis use. Broad shared environmental factors (shared+special twin) played a more significant role in EA (23-29%) than AA (2-15%) women. In AA women, the influence of non-shared environment was more pronounced (42-45% vs. 11-19% in EA women). There was strong evidence for the same familial influences underlying use of both substances (rA=0.82-0.89; rC+T=0.70-0.75). Non-shared environmental factors were also correlated but less so (rE=0.48-0.66). No racial/ethnic differences were apparent in these sources of covariation.\nHeritability of cigarette and cannabis use is comparable across racial/ethnic groups. Differences in the contribution of shared and non-shared environmental influences indicate that different factors may shape substance use in EA and AA women.",

    "abstract": "Despite the latest discovery of obesity-associated genes, the rapid rise in global obesity suggests a major role for environmental factors.

Physical activity was determined using 7-day accelerometry and dietary intake using 3-day 24-h recalls.\nHeavier cotwins were generally less physically active (mean activity counts \u00d7 1,000 per day\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD; 505.5\u2009\u00b1\u2009155.1 vs. 579.6\u2009\u00b1\u2009185.4, P\u2009=\u20090.047) and tended to spend 6.1 min/day less in moderate to vigorous physical activity than leaner cotwins (P\u2009=\u20090.09).

Total fat intake (en%; P\u2009=\u20090.03), specifically monounsaturated fat (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and polyunsaturated fat (P\u2009=\u20090.08), was higher in the heavier cotwins.\nAfter eliminating genetic effects, higher BMI is associated with lower overall and moderate to vigorous physical activity and higher intake of total fat, although the direction of causality cannot be determined. Future identification of the environmental factors responsible for these findings might contribute to developing new strategies in managing obesity.",

    "abstract": "To perform a neurophysiological follow-up at 48 or 60\u2009months of age in children exposed prenatally to progesterone compared with a placebo and evaluate their medical histories up to 8\u2009years of age.\nIn this study, Danish participants of the PREDICT study, including 989 surviving children from 498 twin pregnancies, were followed-up. PREDICT was a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial examining the effect of progesterone for prevention of preterm delivery in unselected twin pregnancies. Medical histories of the children were reviewed and neurophysiological development was evaluated by the parent-completed Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) at either 48 or 60\u2009months after the estimated date of delivery. We used the method of generalized estimating equation to account for the correlation within twins.\nA total of 492 children had been exposed prenatally to progesterone and 497 to placebo. There was no difference in the number of admissions to or length of stay in hospital between the treatment groups, and we found no overall difference in the rates of diagnoses made. However, the odds ratios (ORs) for a diagnosis concerning the heart was 1.66 (95% CI, 0.81-3.37), favoring placebo, among all children, 2.38 (95% CI, 1.07-5.30) in dichorionic twins and 8.19 (95% CI, 1.02-65.6) in all children when excluding diagnoses made at outpatient clinic visits. ASQ scores were available for 437 children (progesterone, n\u2009=\u2009225; placebo, n\u2009=\u2009212). Mean ASQ score was slightly higher in the progesterone group compared with the placebo group (P\u2009=\u20090.03). In dichorionic twins, the risk of having a low ASQ score (<\u200910(th) centile) was decreased in the progesterone group (OR, 0.34 (95% CI, 0.14-0.86)).\nSecond- and third-trimester exposure of the fetus to progesterone does not seem to have long-term harmful effects during childhood, but future studies should focus on cardiac disease in the child.

Recent studies have reported the presence of somatically acquired structural variants in the human genome and it has been suggested that they may accumulate in elderly individuals. To further explore the presence and the age-related acquisition of somatic structural variants in the human genome, we investigated CNVs acquired over a period of 10 years in 86 elderly Danish twins as well as CNV discordances between co-twins of 18 monozygotic twin pairs. Furthermore, the presence of mosaic structural variants was explored. We identified four mosaic acquired uniparental disomy events on chromosome 4q and 14q in the follow-up samples from four individuals, and our study thereby supports the increasing prevalence of somatic mosaic variants with age.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to verify how a pair of monozygotic twins would respond to light-emitting diode therapy (LEDT) or placebo combined with a strength-training program during 12 weeks.\nThis case-control study enrolled a pair of male monozygotic twins, allocated randomly to LEDT or placebo therapies. Light-emitting diode therapy or placebo was applied from a flexible light-emitting diode array (\u03bb = 850 nm, total energy = 75 J, t = 15 seconds) to both quadriceps femoris muscles of each twin immediately after each strength training session (3 times/wk for 12 weeks) consisting of leg press and leg extension exercises with load of 80% and 50% of the 1-repetition maximum test, respectively. Muscle biopsies, magnetic resonance imaging, maximal load, and fatigue resistance tests were conducted before and after the training program to assess gene expression, muscle hypertrophy and performance, respectively. Creatine kinase levels in blood and visual analog scale assessed muscle damage and delayed-onset muscle soreness, respectively, during the training program.\nCompared with placebo, LEDT increased the maximal load in exercise and reduced fatigue, creatine kinase, and visual analog scale. Gene expression analyses showed decreases in markers of inflammation (interleukin 1\u03b2) and muscle atrophy (myostatin) with LEDT. Protein synthesis (mammalian target of rapamycin) and oxidative stress defense (SOD2 [mitochondrial superoxide dismutase]) were up-regulated with LEDT, together with increases in thigh muscle hypertrophy.\nLight-emitting diode therapy can be useful to reduce muscle damage, pain, and atrophy, as well as to increase muscle mass, recovery, and athletic performance in rehabilitation programs and sports medicine.",

    "abstract": "The increased birth rate of twins during recent decades and the improved prognosis of preterm infants have resulted in the need to explore measures that could optimize their growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. It has been postulated that co-bedding simulates twins' intrauterine experiences in which co-regulatory behaviors between them are observed. These behaviors are proposed to benefit twins by reducing their stress, which may promote growth and development. However, in practice, uncertainty surrounds the benefit-risk profile of co-bedding.\nWe aimed to assess the effectiveness of co-bedding compared with separate (individual) care for stable preterm twins in the neonatal nursery in promoting growth and neurodevelopment and reducing short- and long-term morbidities, and to determine whether co-bedding is associated with significant adverse effects.As secondary objectives, we sought to evaluate effects of co-bedding via the following subgroup analyses: twin pairs with different weight ranges (very low birth weight [VLBW] < 1500 grams vs non-VLBW), twins with versus without significant growth discordance at birth, preterm versus borderline preterm twins, twins co-bedded in incubator versus cot at study entry, and twins randomized by twin pair versus neonatal unit.\nWe used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (CNRG). We used keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH) to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (hosted by EBSCOHOST), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and references cited in our short-listed articles, up to February 29, 2016.\nWe included randomized controlled trials with randomization by twin pair and/or by neonatal unit. We excluded cross-over studies.\nWe extracted data using standard methods of the CNRG. Two review authors independently assessed the relevance and risk of bias of retrieved records. We contacted the authors of included studies to request important information missing from their published papers. We expressed our results using risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) when appropriate, along with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We adjusted the unit of analysis from individual infants to twin pairs by averaging measurements for each twin pair (continuous outcomes) or by counting outcomes as positive if developed by either twin (dichotomous outcomes).\nSix studies met the inclusion criteria; however, only five studies provided data for analysis. Four of the six included studies were small and had significant limitations in design. As each study reported outcomes differently, data for most outcomes were effectively contributed by a single study. Study authors reported no differences between co-bedded twins and twins receiving separate care in terms of rate of weight gain (MD 0.20 grams/kg/d, 95% CI -1.60 to 2.00; one study; 18 pairs of twins; evidence of low quality); apnea, bradycardia, and desaturation (A/B/D) episodes (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.18 to 4.05; one study; 62 pairs of twins; evidence of low quality); episodes in co-regulated states (MD 0.96, 95% CI -3.44 to 5.36; one study; three pairs of twins; evidence of very low quality); suspected or proven infection (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.31; three studies; 65 pairs of twins; evidence of very low quality); length of hospital stay (MD -4.90 days, 95% CI -35.23 to 25.43; one study; three pairs of twins; evidence of very low quality); and parental satisfaction measured on a scale of 0 to 55 (MD -0.38, 95% CI -4.49 to 3.73; one study; nine pairs of twins; evidence of moderate quality). Although co-bedded twins appeared to have lower pain scores 30 seconds after heel lance on a scale of 0 to 21 (MD -0.96, 95% CI -1.68 to -0.23; two studies; 117 pairs of twins; I(2) = 75%; evidence of low quality), they had higher pain scores 90 seconds after the procedure (MD 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.86; one study; 62 pairs of twins). Substantial heterogeneity in the outcome of infant pain response after heel prick at 30 seconds post procedure and conflicting results at 30 and 90 seconds post procedure precluded clear conclusions.\nEvidence on the benefits and harms of co-bedding for stable preterm twins was insufficient to permit recommendations for practice. Future studies must be adequately powered to detect clinically important differences in growth and neurodevelopment. Researchers should assess harms such as infection, along with medication errors and caregiver satisfaction.",

At 27 months, the twins were admitted to inpatient rehabilitation, receiving 4 months of rehabilitation promoting strength, endurance, gait training, feeding, communication, developmental skill training, orthotics, adaptive equipment, and caregiver education. Presurgical WeeFIM was 18/126 (twin A) and 19/126 (twin B), and 28/126 (both twins A&B) postsurgical. Prior to surgery, patients performed supine to sit transfers with supervision.\nFollowing surgery, each twin sat and performed bed mobility independently. Twin B performed wheelchair mobility and supported standing at anterior surface with assistance. Discharge WeeFIM was 42/126 (twin A) and 45/126 (twin B). Twins performed floor mobility by scooting, stood at an anterior surface with assistance (maximum for twin A, minimal for twin B), and propelled a manual wheelchair indoors (minimal assistance for both twins A & B).\nRehabilitation of conjoined twins improved presurgical functional status and addressed the unique functional needs of each twin postseparation.",

    "abstract": "The intussusception is one of the most frequent causes of occlusive syndrome in infants and in children. (1) The mesenteric lymphadenopathy, wich is very rare post rotavirus vaccination, can cause intussusception, (2-5) especially in genetically predisposed individuals. (6) There is an association between intussusception and some classes of genotype. (7-9) Two infants aged 3 months, vaccinated against rotavirus. After about a week, one of the 2 identical infants presented inconsolable crying, vomiting, loose stools mixed with blood, and was diagnosed with bowel obstruction with intussusception. He was operated in urgency. After a few hours, his brother presented vomiting, and was admitted to our Hospital for suspected intussusception. The controls carried out have confirmed the presence of intussusception that was treated early, before the onset of severe symptoms. The incidence of post rotavirus vaccine intussusception is very low. The determining factor hypothetically might be linked to the presence of a genotype that exposes infants to a greater risk of developing mesenteric lymphadenitis and intussusception. In our case, the diagnosis of intussusception occurred in a twin, which allowed us to recognize early symptoms which accused the brother and schedule the surgery with less urgency. Our experience may want to sensitize families and pediatricians to report cases of intussusception given a theoretical familiar association. The study of the genotype could be decisive for or not to exclude the presence of a risk of invagination, thus avoiding vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a multifactorial abnormality which has an underlying genetic control but requires environmental influences to trigger. Numerous epidemiological studies have examined the roles of physical inactivity and dietary factors in obesity development. Interactions between obesity-related genes and these lifestyles have also been confirmed. However, less attention has been paid to these complex relationship between cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking and obesity. The purpose of this study was to assess whether cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking were associated with body mass index (BMI), and whether these lifestyle factors modified the genetic variance of BMI.\nSubjects were twins recruited through the Chinese National Twin Registry, aged 18 to 79\u00a0years, and the sample comprised 6121 complete male twin pairs. Information on height, weight, cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking status were assessed with self-report questionnaires. The associations of cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking with BMI were evaluated by linear regression models. Further, structure equation models were conducted to estimate whether cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking status modified the degree of genetic variance of BMI.\nAfter adjustment for a variety of socio-demographic and lifestyle factors, former smokers had higher BMI (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.475; 95\u00a0% CI, 0.196 to 0.754) whereas moderate to heavy smokers had lower BMI (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.115; 95\u00a0% CI, -0.223 to -0.007) when compared with nonsmokers. BMI decreased with increased cigarette pack-years (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.008; 95\u00a0% CI, -0.013 to -0.003). These effects still existed substantially in within-MZ twin pair analyses. By contrast, current alcohol drinking had no significant influence on BMI when additionally controlled for shared factors in within-pair analyses. Genetic modification by alcohol drinking was statistically significant for BMI (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.137; 95\u00a0% CI, -0.215 to -0.058), with the intake of alcohol decreasing the additive genetic component of BMI.\nCigarette smoking was negatively associated with BMI independent of genetic influences. The influence of genes on BMI was moderated by alcohol drinking, such that for individuals who were regular drinkers, genetic factors became less influential. Our findings highlight gene-alcohol interaction in finding candidate genes of BMI and elucidating the etiological factors of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Chudley-McCullough syndrome (CMS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural deafness, agenesis of the corpus callosum, frontal polymicrogyria, interhemispheric cyst, and ventricular enlargement. CMS is caused by mutations in the GPSM2 gene, but until now no more than eight different mutations are on record. We describe two dizygotic twins with a novel homozygous loss-of-function mutation (c.1093C\u2009>\u2009T; p.Arg365*). While one child developed hydrocephalus-prompting shunt implantation immediately after birth, the other sibling did not. The combination of sensorineural hearing loss and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum is a highly recognizable clinico-radiological entity that should prompt mutational analysis of the GPSM2 gene.",

    "abstract": "Most behavioural genetic studies focus on genetic and environmental influences on inter-individual phenotypic differences at the population level. The growing collection of intensive longitudinal data in social and behavioural science offers a unique opportunity to examine genetic and environmental influences on intra-individual phenotypic variability at the individual level. The current study introduces a novel idiographic approach and one novel method to investigate genetic and environmental influences on intra-individual variability by a simple empirical demonstration. Person-specific non-shared environmental influences on intra-individual variability of daily school feelings were estimated using time series data from twenty-one pairs of monozygotic twins (age\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0years, 16 female pairs) over two consecutive weeks. Results showed substantial inter-individual heterogeneity in person-specific non-shared environmental influences. The current study represents a first step in investigating environmental influences on intra-individual variability with an idiographic approach, and provides implications for future behavioural genetic studies to examine developmental processes from a microscopic angle.",

    "abstract": "To review pregnancy outcomes, complication rates and neonatal neural development of selective termination procedures for complicated monochorionic (MC) twins.\nThis was a retrospective review of the pregnancies that underwent selective reduction with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and bipolar cord coagulation (BCC) in our institution.\nForty-eight cases underwent selective reduction with BCC and the remaining 45 with RFA. Overall survival was not statistically different between the RFA and BCC groups (71.1 and 62.5%, p = 0.379). With regard to the indications, the survival rates were not significantly different for twin to twin transfusion syndrome, twin reversed arterial perfusion, discordant anomalies and selective intrauterine growth restriction. Preterm premature rupture of membrane was not statistically different between the BCC and RFA groups (47.9 and 33.3%, p = 0.153). Five foetuses presented with abnormal middle cerebral artery-peak systolic velocity in the BCC group and 4 in the RFA group (p = 0.829). In the BCC group, neurological injury was detected in 2 neonates, presenting with cerebral dysplasia on MR scanning. In the RFA group, intracranial haemorrhage Grade III was detected in one neonate with cranial ultrasound (p = 0.607).\nOverall survival and complication rates following selective reduction in complicated MC twin pregnancies is similar irrespective of whether the reduction was performed using RFA or BCC. Key Message: It seems that selective reduction in MC pregnancies with RFA does not carry a significant decrease in the overall survival and complication rates than the cases with BCC. According to our data, neurodevelopmental impairment of the co-twins is relatively seldom after selective reduction.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to evaluate perfusional changes in brain and placenta of omphalopagus conjoined twins and to compare them with singleton fetuses by using diffusion weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient. Fetal MRIs of 28-week-old omphalopagus conjoined twins with a shared liver with two separate gallbladders and portal and hepatic venous systems and three singleton fetuses with unilateral borderline ventriculomegaly at the same gestational week as control group were enrolled retrospectively. There was a significant decrease in ADC values of brain regions (p = 0.018) and placenta (p = 0.005) of conjoined twins compared to the control group. The decreased ADC values in placenta and brain regions in conjoined twins might be due to decreased placental perfusion compared to singleton pregnancy. Our results would be a keystone for future studies which will compare larger group of monochorionic multiple pregnancies with singleton pregnancies.",

Survival to hospital discharge of at least one baby was 85.6% and dual survival was 52.5%. Median gestational age at delivery was 32.6 weeks (IQR 29.0-35.0 weeks) with a median of 11.4 weeks (IQR 8.3-14.7) from laser to delivery. Median birthweight was 1792 g (IQR 1288-2233 g), with 75% of babies admitted to the nursery, predominantly secondary to prematurity. Immediate SLPCV complications were in utero fetal demise <1 week postprocedure in 27 fetuses (19.6%) and/or ruptured membranes <1 week postprocedure in 9 fetuses (6.6%).\nThis Australian series shows that local outcomes after SLPCV for stages II-IV TTTS remain equal to the international published literature and have remained stable after an initial learning curve. Women were more likely to be Stage II rather than III in the more recent years. However, this does not appear to be attributable to altered referral patterns.",

Coping is a critical mediator of the relationship between stress and psychopathology and a point of clinical intervention for all three disorders. However, little is known about their degree of overlap in coping style, or the influence of unique or shared genetic diathesis. In this study, we examined five factors of coping within and across disorder proband and co-twin groups, modeled heritability, and tested for endophenotypic pattern in a sample of twin pairs recruited from the Swedish Twin Registry (N = 420). Although there was substantial phenotypic overlap across disorders, including low levels of Productive, Problem-Focused coping and high levels of Disengagement, each disorder was associated with a unique profile across other dimensions of coping. We also found evidence of heritability for three of five factors, yet little evidence of genotypic overlap among disorders contributing to similar strategy-use.",

    "abstract": "This prospective cohort study compared obstetric, perinatal and postpartum outcomes of monochorionic diamniotic (n\u2009=\u2009228) versus (vs.) dichorionic (n\u2009=\u2009598) twin pregnancies. Statistical analysis was performed using software SPSS\u00ae v19.0.0.2. Chi square, Fischer's exact, Student's t and Mann-Withney tests were applied. Obstetrical complications rates were 85.5% vs. 75.1% (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Differences were found in preterm premature rupture of membranes (26.3% vs. 19.3%, p\u2009<\u20090.05) and intrauterine growth restriction (19.7% vs. 10.5%, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) occurred in 7.9% of monochorionic pregnancies. Vaginal delivery occurred in 47.4% vs. 43.1%. Monochorionic pregnancies had earlier gestational ages at delivery and subsequently lower birthweights (p\u2009<\u20090.01). There was no difference in Apgar scores. Admission rate of at least one of the newborns in intensive care unit (NICU) was 50% vs. 38.9% (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Postpartum complications were similar. These results were the same excluding TTTS cases, except for admission in NICU (46.8% vs. 34.9%, p\u2009>\u20090.05). Analysing only the uncomplicated pregnancies (33 vs. 149), there were no differences in perinatal outcomes. We conclude that monochorionic pregnancies had higher rates of obstetrical complications, which were independent of TTTS occurrence in our sample. However, considering only the uncomplicated pregnancies till delivery, there were no significant differences in perinatal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Birth weight centile curves are commonly used as a screening tool and to assess the position of a newborn on a given reference distribution. Birth weight of twins are known to be less than those of comparable singletons and twin-specific birth weight centile curves are recommended for use. In this study, we aim to construct gestational age specific birth weight centile curves for twins born in south India.\nThe study was conducted at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, south India. The birth records of all consecutive pregnancies resulting in twin births between 1991 and 2005 were reviewed. Only live twin births between 24 and 42 weeks of gestation were included. Birth weight centiles for gestational age were obtained using the methodology of generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS). Centiles curves were obtained separately for monochorionic and dichorionic twins.\nOf 1530 twin pregnancies delivered during the study period (1991-2005), 1304 were included in the analysis. The median gestational age at birth was 36 weeks (1st quartile 34, 3rd quartile 38 weeks). Smoothed percentile curves for birth weight by gestational age increased progressively till 38 weeks and levels off thereafter. Compared with dichorionic twins, monochorionic twins had lower birth weight for gestational age from after 27 weeks.\nWe provide centile values of birth weight at 24 to 42 completed weeks of gestation for twins born in south India. These charts could be used both in routine clinical assessments and epidemiological studies.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal volume deficits have been linked to life stress. However, the degree to which genes and environment influence the association between hippocampal volume and life events is largely unknown. In total, 123 healthy twins from monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 57 healthy twins were interviewed with the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS), with an overlap of 54 twins undergoing both MRI and the life events interview. Hippocampal volumes were segmented with Freesurfer software. Data were analyzed with OpenMx software. Smaller hippocampal volume was associated with higher severe life event load (rph = -0.39), where shared environmental factors influencing both measures fully explained the association. Hippocampal volume was not associated with total or mild life event load. Hippocampal volume showed high heritability (range, h(2) : 57%-81%) whereas life event measures were influenced by shared (c(2) ) and unique (e(2) ) environmental factors only (range, c(2) :40%-64%, e(2) : 36%-60%). The results suggested that shared environmental factors influenced the relationship between smaller hippocampal volume and severe (but not mild) stress. This indicated that particularly severe life events that were shared between twins were associated with smaller hippocampal volume. Furthermore, it is suggested to distinguish between mild and severe life events in life event research. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of overweight infants and toddlers has increased by 60% in the past 30 years and is a significant contributor to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and early morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organization's updated meta-analysis in 2013 observed an association between breastfeeding and a lower prevalence of obesity later in life. The purpose of this study was to assess the growth of children in a cohort of Australian twins to examine associations between duration of breastfeeding and growth at 18 months of age. Our hypothesis is that the anthropometric measurements of the participants will be greater with shorter duration of breastfeeding.\nMethods include using cross-sectional data from a cohort at the 18-month visit (n = 179) in the Peri/postnatal Epigenetics Twins Study (PETS) to assess the relationship between duration of breastfeeding and infant size at 18 months of age. Inclusion criteria were birth weight of more than 2000 grams and breastfed for less than 1 month, 1 to 3 months, or 4 to 6 months.\nThe analysis suggested that infants breastfed for 1 to 3 months were significantly larger than infants breastfed for 4 to 6 months in terms of mean body mass index (BMI) (0.61 kg/m(2); P = .02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-1.05), arm circumference (0.66 cm; P = .006; 95% CI, 0.26-1.06), and abdominal circumference (1.16 cm; P = .03; 95% CI, 0.26-2.06). The analysis also suggested that infants breastfed for less than 1 month were significantly larger than infants breastfed for 4 to 6 months in terms of mean arm circumference (0.72 cm; P = .009; 95% CI, 0.26-1.17).\nResults suggest that supplementing with non-breast milk before 4 months of age was associated with an increased BMI, arm circumference, and abdominal circumference at 18 months of age. The mean BMI decreased from 85% to 65% when infants were breastfeeding for 4 to 6 months as compared to breastfeeding for 1 to 3 months. Breastfeeding for 4 to 6 months appeared to protect against the risk of obesity for the children in the PETS.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the perinatal outcome in twins, who were administered one complete course of antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) depending on the time interval from corticosteroids to delivery.\nWe carried out a retrospective analysis of medical data of women with twins who received a course of ACS and delivered before 34 weeks within or beyond 7 days after ACS were given. Among 652 twin deliveries between 2006 and 2014, 106 met the criteria (50 patients delivered <7 days and 56 \u2265 7 days after ACS administration).\nThere were no differences in the mean gestational age at labor, mean birthweight, perinatal mortality or newborns' general condition between women who delivered <7 and \u22657 days after corticosteroids. Newborns in the \u22657 days group suffered from respiratory disorders significantly more often (74.1% vs 54.5%, P = 0.003) and were hospitalized longer (42.6 \u00b1 19.1 vs 33.4 \u00b1 21.7 days, P < 0.001). Significantly more infants in the <7 days group were administered antibiotics (55.6% vs 25%, P = 0.001). In the multiple logistic regression analysis, the only factors significantly influencing the incidence of respiratory complications in twins were delivery following ACS therapy within 7 days (adjusted odds ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.90) and female sex (adjusted odds ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval 0.40-0.90).\nThere is a relation between neonatal outcomes in twins and time interval between ACS administration and birth. Therefore, a single ACS course should be administered with caution in order to allow for the completion of the treatment without exceeding an interval of 7 days to delivery. \u00a9 2016 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.",

    "abstract": "Several studies in singletons have shown that maternal exposure to ambient air pollutants is associated with restricted fetal growth. About half of twins have low birth weight compared with six percent in singletons. So far, no studies have investigated maternal air pollution exposure in association with birth weight and small for gestational age in twins. We examined 4760 twins of the East Flanders Prospective Twins Survey (2002-2013), to study the association between in utero exposure to air pollution with birth weight and small for gestational age. Maternal particulate air pollution (PM10) and nitric dioxide (NO2) exposure was estimated using a spatial temporal interpolation method over various time windows during pregnancy. In the total group of twins, we observed that higher PM10 and NO2 exposure during the third trimester was significantly associated with a lower birth weight and higher risk of small for gestational age. However, the association was driven by moderate to late preterm twins (32-36 weeks of gestation). In these twins born between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation, birth weight decreased by 40.2g (95% CI: -69.0 to -11.3; p=0.006) and by 27.3g (95% CI: -52.9 to -1.7; p=0.04) in association for each 10\u00b5g/m\u00b3 increment in PM10 and NO2 concentration during the third trimester. The corresponding odds ratio for small for gestational age were 1.68 (95% CI: 1.27-2.33; p=0.0003) and 1.51 (95% CI: 1.18-1.95; p=0.001) for PM10 or NO2, respectively. No associations between air pollution and birth weight or small for gestational age were observed among term born twins. Finally, in all twins, we found that for each 10\u00b5g/m\u00b3 increase in PM10 during the last month of pregnancy the within-pair birth weight difference increased by 19.6g (95% CI: 3.7-35.4; p=0.02). Assuming causality, an achievement of a 10\u00b5g/m\u00b3 decrease of particulate air pollution may account for a reduction by 40% in small for gestational age, in twins born moderate to late preterm.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate the large bending deformation induced by an array of permanent magnets (applied field \u223c0.02\u2009T) designed to minimize poles in the bent state of the crystal. Planar cantilevers of NiMnGa (5M modulated martensite) ferromagnetic shape memory alloy deform into an arched shape according to theory, with a zig-zag microstructure that complies with the kinematic and magnetic compatibility between adjacent twin variants. A general theory of bent and twisted states is given, applicable to both twinning and austenite/martensite transformations. Some of these configurations achieve order-of-magnitude amplification of rotation and axial strain. We investigate also atomistic analogues of these bent and twisted configurations with perfect interfaces between phases. These mechanisms of large deformation, induced by small magnetic fields or temperature changes, have potential application to the development of new actuation technologies for micro-robotic systems.",

    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to assess sleep bruxism events by directly recording electromyographic activity during sleep and to reveal the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors involved in sleep bruxism in twins.\nThe subjects consisted of 108 twins (mean age 22.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4\u00a0years). Electromyographic activity of temporalis muscles during sleep was evaluated using a portable automatic sleep bruxism analyzer (Grindcare 3.0, Medotech A/S), and recordings were carried out for at least three consecutive nights. Quantitative genetic statistics based on structural equation modeling was utilized to estimate variance components.\nMonozygotic twin-pair correlation for the number of nocturnal electromyographic activities recorded in this study (r\u00a0=\u00a00.463, P\u00a0=\u00a00.009) was higher than dizygotic twin-pair correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.103, P\u00a0=\u00a00.725). The proportion of total phenotypic variance in the liability of sleep bruxism to attribute to genetic influences, related to the electromyographic activities, was 48\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 17-95\u00a0%) and to unique environmental influences was 52\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 28-82\u00a0%).\nAdditive genetic effects may be a contributing factor to the occurrence of nocturnal EMG activity associated with sleep bruxism.\nA greater understanding of the contribution of genetic factors could have beneficial uses, including enhanced accuracy of sleep bruxism diagnosis, management of sleep bruxism, and enhanced estimation of the prognosis for patients suffering from sleep bruxism. In addition, it could be also important to adequately evaluate the environmental factors in patients with sleep bruxism.",

The proportion of total phenotypic variance in the liability of sleep bruxism to attribute to genetic influences, related to the electromyographic activities, was 48\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 17-95\u00a0%) and to unique environmental influences was 52\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 28-82\u00a0%).",

    "abstract": "We analyzed birth order differences in means and variances of height and body mass index (BMI) in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins from infancy to old age. The data were derived from the international CODATwins database. The total number of height and BMI measures from 0.5 to 79.5 years of age was 397,466. As expected, first-born twins had greater birth weight than second-born twins. With respect to height, first-born twins were slightly taller than second-born twins in childhood. After adjusting the results for birth weight, the birth order differences decreased and were no longer statistically significant. First-born twins had greater BMI than the second-born twins over childhood and adolescence. After adjusting the results for birth weight, birth order was still associated with BMI until 12 years of age. No interaction effect between birth order and zygosity was found. Only limited evidence was found that birth order influenced variances of height or BMI. The results were similar among boys and girls and also in MZ and DZ twins. Overall, the differences in height and BMI between first- and second-born twins were modest even in early childhood, while adjustment for birth weight reduced the birth order differences but did not remove them for BMI.",

    "abstract": "DNA catenanes are assemblies made up of two or more DNA rings linked together through mechanical bonds, and they are desirable for engineering unique nanoscale devices. However, current methods of synthesizing DNA catenanes rely on the formation of strong linking duplexes between component units to enable interlocking and thus do not permit the synthesis of complex single-stranded DNA structures with freely functioning units. We have recently reported DNA sequences that can thread through a DNA circle without the formation of a linking duplex. Here we show that these unique DNA molecules can be further used to make intricate symmetric or asymmetric DNA [3]catenanes, single-stranded DNA assemblies made up of a central mother ring interlocked to two identical or fraternal twin daughter rings, which have never been reported before. These addressable freely functioning interlocked DNA rings should facilitate the design of elaborate nanoscale machines based on DNA.",

    "abstract": "In the interstitium of the connective tissue several types of cells occur. The fibroblasts, responsible for matrix formation, the mast cells, involved in local response to inflammatory stimuli, resident macrophages, plasma cells, lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes, all engaged in immunity responses. Recently, another type of interstitial cell, found in all organs so far examined, has been added to the previous ones, the telocytes (TC). In the gut, in addition to the cells listed above, there are also the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), a peculiar type of cell exclusively detected in the alimentary tract with multiple functions including pace-maker activity. The possibility that TC and ICC could correspond to a unique cell type, where the former would represent an ICC variant outside the gut, was initially considered, however, further studies have clearly shown that ICC and TC are two distinct types of cells. In the gut, while the features and the roles of the ICC are established, part of the scientific community is still disputing these 'new' interstitial cells to which several names such as fibroblast-like cells (FLCs), interstitial Cajal-like cells or, most recently, PDGFR\u03b1+ cells have been attributed. This review will detail the main features and roles of the TC and ICC with the aim to establish their relationships and hopefully define the identity of the TC in the gut.",

    "abstract": "To investigate rates of progression, regression and stabilisation and outcomes for stage I twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and significant liquor discordant (LD) monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins referred to the New South Wales Fetal Therapy Centre between June 2007 and May 2013.\nRetrospective cohort study of 329 monochorionic referrals, of whom 47 had LD and 28 had stage I TTTS at presentation; 43 were stage I or higher at any time during surveillance. Clinical progression, rates of therapy, survival and associated complications were evaluated.\nOf stage I cases, 64% (18/28) remained stable or regressed, with 60% (6/10) of those progressing becoming at least stage II within 2\u2009weeks. Of LD cases, 7/47 (15%) progressed to stage I TTTS, 8/47 (17%) to stage II or higher and 3/47 (6%) to selective intrauterine growth restriction (38% total).\nWhile a stable clinical picture was the most common outcome in stage I/LD presentations, progression to stage\u2009\u2265\u2009II TTTS occurred in 36 and 17% respectively, indicating that LD is not a benign finding. Rapid progression in the majority of progressive cases and modest overall survival rates support close surveillance of these pregnancies and investigation of laser therapy as a first-line treatment of stage I TTTS. \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies have lacked statistical power to apply advanced genetic modelling techniques to the search for cognitive endophenotypes for bipolar disorder.\nTo quantify the shared genetic variability between bipolar disorder and cognitive measures.\nStructural equation modelling was performed on cognitive data collected from 331 twins/siblings of varying genetic relatedness, disease status and concordance for bipolar disorder.\nUsing a parsimonious AE model, verbal episodic and spatial working memory showed statistically significant genetic correlations with bipolar disorder (rg = |0.23|-|0.27|), which lost statistical significance after covarying for affective symptoms. Using an ACE model, IQ and visual-spatial learning showed statistically significant genetic correlations with bipolar disorder (rg = |0.51|-|1.00|), which remained significant after covarying for affective symptoms.\nVerbal episodic and spatial working memory capture a modest fraction of the bipolar diathesis. IQ and visual-spatial learning may tap into genetic substrates of non-affective symptomatology in bipolar disorder.",

    "abstract": "Recipients of the twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) often develop cardiac manifestations, but arterial calcification has rarely been reported. Generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) is a genetic disorder with high infantile mortality. We report the case of a TTTS recipient with moderate cardiomyopathy at diagnosis who developed progressive calcification of the pulmonary arteries and aorta after successful in utero laser therapy. Postnatally, both twins were diagnosed with a heterozygous ABCC6 gene mutation associated with GACI. The recipient had progressive supravalvular pulmonary and aortic stenosis, was treated with bisphosphonate therapy, and successfully underwent cardiac surgery at 4 months of age. The donor twin with the same mutation remained phenotypically normal at 15 months of age. This case illustrates monozygotic fetuses with discordant in utero hemodynamics, with subsequent development of phenotypic differences. TTTS recipients with arterial calcifications should undergo genetic testing for GACI.",

    "abstract": "A high twinning rate and an increased risk of mortality among twins contribute to the high burden of infant mortality in Africa. This study examined the contribution of twins to neonatal and post-neonatal mortality in The Gambia, and evaluated factors that contribute to the excess mortality among twins.\nWe analysed data from the Basse Health and Demographic Surveillance System (BHDSS) collected from January 2009 to December 2013. Demographic and epidemiological variables were assessed for their association with mortality in different age groups.\nWe included 32,436 singletons and 1083 twins in the analysis (twining rate 16.7/1000 deliveries). Twins represented 11.8\u00a0% of all neonatal deaths and 7.8\u00a0% of post-neonatal deaths. Mortality among twins was higher than in singletons [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.33 (95 % CI: 3.09, 6.06) in the neonatal period and 2.61 (95 % CI: 1.85, 3.68) in the post-neonatal period]. Post-neonatal mortality among twins increased in girls (P for interaction\u2009=\u20090.064), being born during the dry season (P for interaction\u2009=\u20090.030) and lacking access to clean water (P for interaction\u2009=\u20090.042).\nMortality among twins makes a significant contribution to the high burden of neonatal and post-neonatal mortality in The Gambia and preventive interventions targeting twins should be prioritized.",

    "abstract": "Bullying victimization in childhood is associated with a broad array of serious mental health disturbances, including anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation and behavior. The key goal of this study was to evaluate whether bullying victimization is a true environmental risk factor for psychiatric disturbance using data from 145 bully-discordant monozygotic (MZ) juvenile twin pairs from the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral Development (VTSABD) and their follow-up into young adulthood.\nSince MZ twins share an identical genotype and familial environment, a higher rate of psychiatric disturbance in a bullied MZ twin compared to their non-bullied MZ co-twin would be evidence of an environmental impact of bullying victimization. Environmental correlations between being bullied and the different psychiatric traits were estimated by fitting structural equation models to the full sample of MZ and DZ twins (N = 2824). Environmental associations were further explored using the longitudinal data on the bullying-discordant MZ twins.\nBeing bullied was associated with a wide range of psychiatric disorders in both children and young adults. The analysis of data on the MZ-discordant twins supports a genuine environmental impact of bullying victimization on childhood social anxiety [odds ratio (OR) 1.7], separation anxiety (OR 1.9), and young adult suicidal ideation (OR 1.3). There was a shared genetic influence on social anxiety and bullying victimization, consistent with social anxiety being both an antecedent and consequence of being bullied.\nBullying victimization in childhood is a significant environmental trauma and should be included in any mental health assessment of children and young adults.",

    "abstract": "Our case describes the serial microbiome changes in twins discordant for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), who shared similar intrauterine and early environmental exposures. The key findings were that the 2 neonates had distinctly different microbiome compositions from the first stool samples collected. Also, in the twin who developed NEC there was a decrease in bacterial diversity and an increase in Proteobacteria a week before developing any clinical symptoms, suggesting an early role of the intestinal microbiome in the development of NEC. Here we briefly review the literature on the role of the intestinal microbiome in NEC and how a greater understanding of the neonatal microbiome and host interactions may help mitigate this devastating disease.",

    "abstract": "Despite the commonly held belief that homosexual males and females are more creative compared to heterosexuals, empirical studies on homosexuality and its relationship to creativity have been sparse, often with questionable methodology and very small sample sizes, reporting mixed findings. No study till date has explored the associations described above in a large population-based and genetically informative sample. Here, we examined such potential associations between sexual orientation and creative achievement in several different domains (music, writing, dance, visual arts, science, invention, and theater) using a large cohort of 4494 Swedish twins (of which 7.5\u00a0% were not exclusively heterosexual). Data were analyzed for the sexes separately as well as pooled. Results showed significant associations between sexual orientation and two of the creative domains-theater and writing-with non-heterosexuals being more creative in these domains. In all other domains, no significant differences were found between the non-heterosexual and heterosexual groups. Findings from co-twin control analyses suggested that the significant associations may not be causal in nature (i.e., homosexual orientation leads to higher creativity) but due to shared liability. However, we lacked power to differentiate between shared genetic and shared environmental influences. Results and potential implications are discussed critically.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe, debilitating, and complex psychiatric disorder with multiple causative factors. An increasing number of studies have determined that rare variations play an important role in its etiology. A somatic mutation is a rare form of genetic variation that occurs at an early stage of embryonic development and is thought to contribute substantially to the development of SCZ. The aim of the study was to explore the novel pathogenic somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and somatic insertions and deletions (indels) of SCZ.\nOne Chinese family with a monozygotic (MZ) twin pair discordant for SCZ was included. Whole exome sequencing was performed in the co-twin and their parents. Rigorous filtering processes were conducted to prioritize pathogenic somatic variations, and all identified SNVs and indels were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\nOne somatic SNV and two somatic indels were identified after rigorous selection processes. However, none was validated by Sanger sequencing.\nThis study is not alone in the failure to identify pathogenic somatic variations in MZ twins, suggesting that exonic somatic variations are extremely rare. Further efforts are warranted to explore the potential genetic mechanism of SCZ.",

This study examined the etiological heterogeneity of math performance in a sample of 264 pairs of 12-year-old twins assessed on measures of math achievement, numerosity and math anxiety. Latent profile analysis indicated five groupings of individuals representing different patterns of math achievement, numerosity and math anxiety, coupled with differing degrees of familial transmission. These results suggest that there may be distinct profiles of math achievement, numerosity and anxiety; particularly for students who struggle in math.",

    "abstract": "Bidirectional pathways between twin relationship quality and friendship quality were investigated in a large longitudinal twin cohort. We examined negative and positive relationship features in 313 monozygotic (MZ) twins and 238 same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twins from ages 13 to 14 years, using latent structural modeling. Results showed stronger stability of the twin relationship quality compared to friendship quality. Positive features in the sibling relationship were associated with increased positive features in the relationship with the best friend a year later. In contrast, no significant association between negative sibling relationship features and change in negative friendship quality features was found. These findings speak to the important role of the sibling relationship in the development of good quality friendship relations in twins.",

    "abstract": "Deformation twinning in pure aluminum has been considered to be a unique property of nanostructured aluminum. A lingering mystery is whether deformation twinning occurs in coarse-grained or single-crystal aluminum at scales beyond nanotwins. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of macrodeformation twins in single-crystal aluminum formed under an ultrahigh strain rate (\u223c10^{6}\u2009\u2009s^{-1}) and large shear strain (200%) via dynamic equal channel angular pressing. Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the frustration of subsonic dislocation motion leads to transonic deformation twinning. Deformation twinning is rooted in the rate dependences of dislocation motion and twinning, which are coupled, complementary processes during severe plastic deformation under ultrahigh strain rates.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION. Pentalogy of Cantrell is a very rare congenital multiple malformation with the poor outcome. Syndrome included the following pentad: abdominal wall defect, a defect of the lower sternum, anterior diaphragm defect, ectopia cordis, as well as a variety of intracardiac anomalies.\nIn the fifteenth week of the twin pregnancy, ultrasound examination showed multiple anomalies in one, as well as the absence of the nose apex in the other twin. The autopsy of the fetuses was performed after the abortion had been approved by the Ethics Committee. The external examination of the fetus number one showed ectopic heart and omphalocele. The internal examination revealed the existence of sternum cleft, ectopic heart and part of the left lung outside the thoracic cavity, the presence of diaphragmatic hernia with protrusion of abdominal organs, heart with only one large vessel and the horseshoe kidney. The full expression of the Pentalogy of Cantrell was confirmed. The external and internal examination of the other twin showed just agenesis of the nose apex.\nRecognition and diagnosis of the syndrome is of the exceptional importance. Proper and timely diagnosis should contribute to good outcome of the pregnancy and delivery.",

    "abstract": "Background\u2003Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the most common causes of serious viral intrauterine infections. It is universally distributed among the human population with an average incidence of 0.15 to 2%. Indeed, at least half of the women in the reproductive age have evidence of prior CMV infection. Epidemiology and Pathogenicity\u2003However, it is not a usual practice to screen asymptomatic pregnant woman or neonates for CMV. Even if a mother developed a primary CMV infection during pregnancy, up to 90% of the newborns with congenital CMV will be asymptomatic at the time of birth. Only 5 to 7% of the infected babies will be acutely symptomatic, and the typical clinical presentation includes intrauterine growth restriction, microcephaly, various cutaneous manifestations (including petechiae and purpura), hematological abnormalities (particularly resistant thrombocytopenia), hepatosplenomegaly, chorioretinitis, hepatitis, etc. In contrast, acquired CMV infection is extremely unlikely to cause any serious sequelae for the infant. Cases\u2003 We present a case of congenital and acquired CMV infection in twins with a focus of dissimilarity in presentation, clinical course, and outcome.",

    "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI) is a progressive, autosomal, recessive lysosomal disorder. This disorder, due to a deficiency in N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (ASB), results in an accumulation of glycosaminoglycan (GAG), causing multiple organ failures. In this study, monochorionic biamniotic twins with the severe form of MPS VI underwent enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with weekly infusions of recombinant human ASB (galsulfase) at 1\u00a0mg/kg. After 9 years of ERT, a comprehensive clinical examination was performed. Several types of biochemical, immunological, and genetic investigations were also conducted. Both twins showed the typical symptoms and signs of MPS VI at baseline, including short stature, progressive dysmorphic facial features, and dysostosis multiplex. Twin 2 presented stronger multisystemic involvement, with marked musculoskeletal, neurological, and odontological components. She also developed an ischemic spinal cord lesion after surgery, which is the first case described in the literature in Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome. However, the extent of disease was found to be equally stabilized in the two sisters, concretely the cardiac and respiratory functions and body length. The early diagnosis and treatment of MPS VI are critical for an optimal clinical outcome, and further evidence for the new treatment strategies is needed.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins stem from the same single fertilized egg and therefore share all their inherited genetic variation. This is one of the unequivocal facts on which genetic epidemiology and twin studies are based. To what extent this also implies that MZ twins share genotypes in adult tissues is not precisely established, but a common pragmatic assumption is that MZ twins are 100% genetically identical also in adult tissues. During the past decade, this view has been challenged by several reports, with observations of differences in post-zygotic copy number variations (CNVs) between members of the same MZ pair. In this study, we performed a systematic search for differences of CNVs within 38 adult MZ pairs who had been misclassified as dizygotic (DZ) twins by questionnaire-based assessment. Initial scoring by PennCNV suggested a total of 967 CNV discordances. The within-pair correlation in number of CNVs detected was strongly dependent on confidence score filtering and reached a plateau of r = 0.8 when restricting to CNVs detected with confidence score larger than 50. The top-ranked discordances were subsequently selected for validation by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), from which one single ~120kb deletion in NRXN1 on chromosome 2 (bp 51017111-51136802) was validated. Despite involving an exon, no sign of cognitive/mental consequences was apparent in the affected twin pair, potentially reflecting limited or lack of expression of the transcripts containing this exon in nerve/brain.",

    "abstract": "To explore asymmetry values of antimeric deciduous tooth crown dimensions in three types of twins: monozygotic (MZ), dizygotic same-sex (DZ) and opposite-sex (OS) vs. single-born controls.\nMesiodistal and labio-lingual crown dimensions of second deciduous molars and mesiodistal canine and first molar crown dimensions of 2159 children at 6-12 years of age were evaluated, originating from the US cross-sectional Collaborative Perinatal Study from the 1970s, including altogether MZ (n = 28), DZ same-sex (n = 33) and OS (n = 39) pairs. Single born (n = 1959) were used as controls.\nDental casts were measured for comparison of variance relationships calculated from antimeric teeth, exhibiting fluctuating (FA), and directional (DA) asymmetry using anova.\nSignificant differences appeared in MZ and OS girls in DA of deciduous canines, which gain size in the first and second trimester, and deciduous second molars, which finally stop crown growth during the early post-natal period. Significantly, increased FA values appeared for lower deciduous canines and second molars, indicating greatest environmental stress in OS girls, MZ girls and DZ boys. Twin girls had more fluctuating and directional crown asymmetry than twin boys, but in some dimensions, the twins were more symmetric than controls.\nTransmembrane hormonal influence between opposite-sex twins, and late gestational stress factors, caused by placental malfunction and/or monochorionicity, may be involved in asymmetric growth of antimers, during critical periods of crown size gain.",

    "abstract": "Choosing the ideal face-lift technique for a patient presents an added challenge for the plastic surgeon. With the multitude of well-established variations of this procedure, it would be beneficial to define which facioplasty technique produces the optimal result. By comparing the postoperative results from two of the most popularized face-lift incision techniques in monozygotic twins, it is hypothesized that the \"best\" technique may be determined.\nFour sets of identical twins and one set of identical triplets underwent face-lift surgery performed by the senior author (D.E.A.). Incision technique selection was randomized, with the first-born twin undergoing the full-incision operation. Short- and long-term postoperative photographs were taken at approximately 1 and 5 years and subsequently graded by eight board-certified plastic surgeons with over 100 years of combined experience.\nData obtained from this study suggest that no difference between these incisions exists at the shorter term follow-up. However, analysis of the long-term follow-up revealed a significant difference between the average scores assigned to the neck region, with the full-incision technique receiving a higher score.\nThese findings suggest that at the short-term follow-up, both the short-scar and full-incision techniques yield comparable results. However, at the longer term follow-up, a significant difference appears between the two procedures exclusively in the neck region. Although a shorter incision is appealing to the patient and surgeon, this study suggests that the full incision may offer a superior long-term result in the neck.\nTherapeutic, II.",

    "abstract": "A complex interrelation exists between change in depression symptomatology and cognitive decline. Studies indicate either that depression is a direct risk factor for cognitive change over time, or vice versa. Longitudinal twin studies provide the possibility to unravel cause and effect of correlated traits. Here, we have applied twin modeling approaches to shed light on the genetic correlation between both level and change of depression symptomatology and cognitive functioning, and to further explore the bidirectionality of any such correlation using assessments of both phenotypes at two occasions 10 years apart. The study included 2,866 Danish twins with a mean age of 56.8 years at intake (range: 45-68 years). Of these, 1,267 were intact pairs. A total number of 1,582 twins (55%), of whom 557 were intact pairs, participated in the follow-up survey. We found stable cross-sectional heritability estimates of approximately 60% for general cognitive abilities and 30% for affective depressive symptoms. There was a considerable decline in the mean cognitive performance over 10 years, whereas the mean affective depression symptoms score was stable and with no genetic contribution to any individual change. Additionally, we saw a small but significant cross-trait correlation at both occasions (-0.11 and -0.09, respectively), but cross-trait cross-occasion analysis revealed no evidence that either of the two traits predicts the other over a 10-year interval. Thus, our study was not able to detect any causal association between change in depressive symptomatology and cognitive decline in middle-aged and elderly people over a 10-year interval.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the multifactorial etiology of mandibular tori analyzing the influence of genetics, occlusal overload, various clinical variables and their interactions.\nOverall, plaster casts of 162 twins (81 twin pairs) were analyzed for the presence or absence of mandibular tori. Atypical wear facets on canine tips or incisors were recorded to diagnose bruxism. Angle Class, any kind of anterior open bite and positive, negative or flat curve of Wilson were recorded. Zygosity determination was carried out using a DNA test.\nMandibular tori were found in 56.8% of the cases. In 93.6% of all monozygotic twin pairs both individuals had or did not have mandibular tori (\u03ba=0.96\u00b10.04; p<0.001), compared to 79.4% concordance of mandibular tori in dizygotic co-twins (\u03ba=0.7\u00b10.12; p<0.001). Prevalence of mandibular tori was significantly higher in the group of bruxers (67.5%) compared to non-bruxers (31.3%) (p<0.001). Significant association between mandibular tori and negative or flat curve of Wilson in the maxillary second premolars and first molars was found (OR=2.55, 95% CI (1.19-5.46), p=0.016). In all monozygotic bruxers, 97.1% showed concordance of mandibular tori presence in both co-twins compared to 78.9% dizygotic bruxers, and this difference is statistically significant (p=0.007).\nOur results suggest that the mandibular tori are of a multifactorial origin. Mandibular tori seem to have genetic predisposition, and may be associated with teeth grinding as well as with negative or flat CW in region of maxillary second premolar and first molar.",

    "abstract": "Doppler interrogation studies of the liver blood flow indicate altered hepatic vein waveforms in association with impaired hepatocellular function. However, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for variations of these parameters in the absence of disease. We aimed to investigate the contribution of heritable and environmental factors to the physiological variability of hepatic vein flow in a twin cohort. Two hundred twenty-eight healthy adult Hungarian twins (69 monozygotic, 45 same-sex dizygotic pairs) underwent Doppler sonography of the hepatic vein. Age- and sex-adjusted heritability of the highest velocity (amplitude of S wave) of hepatic vein flow was negligible. Shared environment contributed to 33% (95% CI, 16%-51%), and unshared environment was responsible for the largest portion (67%; 95% CI, 49%-84%) of the variance. Duration of sports activities was significantly (P < 0.05) related to the magnitude of hepatic vein flow, while other risk factors and lifestyle characteristics had no significant influence. The data suggest that genetic factors have little impact on the parameters of hepatic venous blood flow. The variability observed in healthy twins by the Doppler interrogation can be explained by the effect of unshared environmental components primarily related to regular physical activity. These findings underscore the importance of unique environments in physiological variations of hepatic venous blood flow.",

    "abstract": "Symptomatic knee osteoarthritis is a highly age and sex associated complex disease. Little is known about the causes behind this age and sex associated increase, or if genetic and environmental factors impacts differently by gender. Our study examined the risk and heritability of primary knee osteoarthritis leading to total knee arthroplasty and whether these differences were attributable to sex and age differences in heritability.\nAll twins of known zygosity from The Danish Twin Register alive in 1997 were examined in a nationwide population based follow-up study collecting information on all twins recorded in The Danish Knee Arthroplasty from 1997 to follow-up in 2010. Our main outcomes were the cumulative incidence, probandwise concordance rates, heritability, within pair correlations in monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs and the genetic and environmental influence estimated in models taking into account that individuals may not have had a total knee arthroplasty at follow up.\n92,748 twins were eligible for analyses and 576 twins had a record of primary knee osteoarthritis in The Danish Knee Arthroplasty Register at follow-up comprising 358 female and 218 male twin cases. The risk increased particular after the age of 50\u00a0years displaying significant sex differences in the elderly. In the sex stratified analyses a discrete genetic component was found in females, but in males no genetic component could be detected. In both genders common and unique environmental factors were highly significant. In the sex-adjusted analysis an additive genetic component of 18\u00a0% (0; 62), a shared environmental component of 61\u00a0% (25; 97) and an individual environmental component of 21\u00a0% (6; 36) accounted for the variation in liability to primary total knee arthroplasty.\nThe risk of primary total knee arthroplasty increases significantly after the age of 50\u00a0years, in particular in females, displaying significant sex differences in the elderly. After sex-adjustment 82\u00a0% of the variation in liability to primary total knee arthroplasty was attributable to common and unique environmental factors; the remaining 18\u00a0% of this variation was attributable to additive genetic factors indicating a pivotal impact of environmental factors on this disease.",

    "abstract": "Twins have a higher-than-expected risk of infantile hemangiomas (IHs), but the exact reasons for this association are not clear. Comparing concordant and discordant twin pairs might help elucidate these factors and yield more information about IH risk factors.\nA prospective cohort study of twin pairs from 12 pediatric dermatology centers in the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Spain was conducted. Information regarding maternal pregnancy history, family history of vascular birthmarks, zygosity (if known), and pregnancy-related information was collected. Information regarding twins (N = 202 sets) included birthweight, gestational age (GA), presence or absence of IHs, numbers and subtypes of IHs, presence of other birthmarks, and other medical morbidities.\nTwo hundred two sets of twins were enrolled. Concordance for IH was present in 37% of twin pairs. Concordance for IH was inversely related to gestational age (GA), present in 42% of GA of 32 weeks or less, 36% of GA of 33 to 36 weeks, and 32% of GA of 37 weeks or more. Twins of GA of 34 weeks or less were more than two and a half times as likely to be concordant as those of GA of 35 weeks or more (odds ratio (OR) = 2.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.42-4.99; p < 0.01). In discordant twins, lower birthweight conferred a high risk of IH; of the 64 sets of twins with 10% or greater difference in weight, the smaller twin had IH in 62.5% (n = 40) of cases, versus 37.5% (n = 24) of cases in which the higher-birthweight twin was affected. Zygosity was reported in 188 twin sets (93%). Of these, 78% were dizygotic and 22% monozygotic. There was no statistically significant difference in rates of concordance between monozygotic twins (43%, 18/42) and dizygotic twins (36%, 52/146) (p = 0.50). In multivariate analysis comparing monozygotic and dizygotic twins, adjusting for effects of birthweight and sex, the likelihood of concordance for monozygotic was not appreciably higher than that for dizygotic twins (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.52-2.49). Female sex also influenced concordance, confirming the effects of female sex on IH risk. The female-to-male ratio was 1.7:1 in the entire cohort and 1.9:1 in those with IH. Of the 61 concordant twin sets with known sex of both twins, 41% were female/female, 43% were female/male, and 16% were male/male.\nThese findings suggest that the origin of IHs is multifactorial and that predisposing factors such as birthweight, sex, and GA may interact with one another such that a threshold is reached for clinical expression.",

    "abstract": "The rate of change in metabolic phenotypes can be highly indicative of metabolic disorders and disorder-related modifications. We analyzed data from longitudinal twin studies on multiple metabolic phenotypes in Danish and Chinese twins representing two populations of distinct ethnic, cultural, social-economic backgrounds and geographical environments.\nThe study covered a relatively large sample of 502 pairs of Danish adult twins followed up for a long period of 12 years with a mean age at intake of 38 years (range: 18-65) and a total of 181 Chinese adult twin pairs traced for about 7 years with a mean baseline age of 39.5 years (range: 23-64). The classical twin models were fitted to the longitudinal change in each phenotype (\u0394phenotype) to estimate the genetic and environmental contributions to the variation in \u0394phenotype.\nModerate to high contributions by the unique environment were estimated for all phenotypes in both Danish (from 0.51 for low density lipoprotein cholesterol up to 0.72 for triglycerides) and Chinese (from 0.41 for triglycerides up to 0.73 for diastolic blood pressure) twins; low to moderate genetic components were estimated for long-term change in most of the phenotypes in Danish twins except for triglycerides and hip circumference. Compared with Danish twins, the Chinese twins tended to have higher genetic control over the longitudinal changes in lipids (except high density lipoprotein cholesterol) and glucose, higher unique environmental contribution to blood pressure but no genetic contribution to longitudinal change in body mass traits.\nOur results emphasize the major contribution of unique environment to the observed intra-individual variation in all metabolic phenotypes in both samples, and meanwhile reveal differential patterns of genetic and common environmental regulation on changes over time in metabolic phenotypes across the two samples.",

    "abstract": "Leisure-time physical activity is a key contributor to physical and mental health. Yet the role of physical activity in modulating cortical function is poorly known. We investigated whether precognitive sensory brain functions are associated with the level of physical activity. Physical activity history (3-yr-LTMET), physiological measures and somatosensory mismatch response (sMMR) in EEG were recorded in 32 young healthy twins. In all participants, 3-yr-LTMET correlated negatively with body fat%, r=-0.77 and positively with VO2max, r=0.82. The fat% and VO2max differed between 15 physically active and 17 inactive participants. Trend toward larger sMMR was seen in inactive compared to active participants. This finding was significant in a pairwise comparison of 9 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for physical activity. Larger sMMR reflecting stronger synchronous neural activity may reveal diminished gating of precognitive somatosensory information in physically inactive healthy young men compared to the active ones possibly rendering them more vulnerable to somatosensory distractions from their surroundings.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine similarities and differences between disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) and bipolar disorder not otherwise specified (BP-NOS) in baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and 36 month course of irritability in children 6-12.9 years of age.\nA total of 140 children with DMDD and 77 children with BP-NOS from the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms cohort were assessed at baseline, then reassessed every 6 months for 36 months.\nGroups were similar on most sociodemographic and baseline clinical variables other than most unfiltered (i.e., interviewer-rated regardless of occurrence during a mood episode) Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and parent-reported General Behavior Inventory-10 Item Mania (PGBI-10M) items. Children with DMDD received lower scores on every item (including irritability) except impaired insight; differences were significant except for sexual interest and disruptive-aggressive behavior. Children with DMDD received lower scores on eight of 10 PGBI-10M items, the other two items rated irritability. Youth with DMDD were significantly less likely to have a biological parent with a bipolar diagnosis than were youth with BP-NOS. Children with DMDD were more likely to be male and older than children with BP-NOS, both small effect sizes, but had nearly double the rate of disruptive behavior disorders (large effect). Caregiver ratings of irritability based on the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-4R (CASI-4R) were comparable at baseline; the DMDD group had a small but significantly steeper decline in scores over 36 months relative to the BP-NOS group (b\u2009=\u2009-0.24, SE\u2009=\u20090.12, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.0004). Trajectories for both groups were fairly stable, in the midrange of possible scores.\nIn a sample selected for elevated symptoms of mania, twice as many children were diagnosed with DMDD than with BP-NOS. Children with DMDD and BP-NOS are similar on most characteristics other than manic symptoms, per se, and parental history of bipolar disorder. Chronic irritability is common in both groups. Comprehensive evaluations are needed to diagnose appropriately. Clinicians should not assume that chronic irritability leads exclusively to a DMDD diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Some prior studies have shown that symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (sPDA) is highly familial. Although it is estimated that both genetic and environmental factors may contribute to sPDA, evidence is still lacking.\nThe aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for sPDA, focusing on the genetic and in utero environment by analyzing very low birth weight (VLBW) singletons and twins.\nThis retrospective case-control study reviewed the medical records of 445 VLBW infants (25 weeks \u2264 gestational age <32 weeks, 600 g \u2264 birth weight <1,500 g) and compared the incidence of sPDA among monochorionic diamniotic (MD) twins (n = 65), dichorionic diamniotic (DD) twins (n = 66), and singletons (n = 314).\nStepwise multiple regression analysis showed that twin siblings (p = 0.001), gestational week (p < 0.001), antenatal steroid use (p = 0.021), and premature rupture of membranes (p = 0.002) were independent predictors of sPDA. Incidence of sPDA in MD twin siblings was significantly higher than that in singletons (p < 0.01), whereas no significant difference was found between singletons and DD twins or between MD and DD twins.\nThe current results show that being a VLBW MD twin is an independent risk factor for sPDA, and that both genetic and in utero environmental factors may contribute to its development.",

It has been shown that terminal deletions of the chromosome 9q34.3 region, or EHMT1 gene mutations, lead to Kleefstra syndrome. We present 16-month-old twin sisters, one of whom had originally been referred for Down syndrome screening due to hypotonia, growth and development retardation, dysmorphic facial signs, and accompanying congenital heart disease. They were subsequently diagnosed as Kleefstra syndrome based on subtelomeric FISH analysis. In conclusion, Kleefstra syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of Down syndrome because it presents with very similar phenotypic features.",

    "abstract": "This report discusses a unique case of monozygotic male twins who both collapsed with exertional heat stroke (EHS) during the same marathon in relatively cool conditions. The twins were official race pacers in a popular city marathon held in the early spring in the UK. Both recovered uneventfully due to the prompt recognition of EHS and use of aggressive cooling measures, which prevented life-threatening complications. The case illustrates that EHS is a complex illness with a possible genetic predisposition, which can occur among runners even in cooler conditions. This link is explored together with the influence of their role as race pacers and the additional backpack worn in the development of EHS.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), the most common hereditary cerebral small vessel disease, is caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene on chromosome 19. Clinical manifestations of CADASIL include recurrent transient ischemic attacks, strokes, cognitive defects, epilepsy, migraine and psychiatric symptoms. Parkinsonian features have variably been reported in CADASIL patients, but only a few patients showed a clear parkinsonian syndrome. We studied two patients, a pair of monozygotic twins, carrying the R1006C mutation of the NOTCH3 gene and affected by a parkinsonian syndrome. For the first time in CADASIL patients, we used transcranial sonography (TCS) to assess basal ganglia abnormalities. TCS showed a bilateral hyperechogenic pattern of substantia nigra in one twin, and a right hyperechogenic pattern in the other. In both patients, lenticular nuclei showed a bilateral hyperechogenic pattern, and the width of the third ventricle was slightly increased. The TCS pattern found in our CADASIL patients is characteristic neither for Parkinson's disease, nor for vascular parkinsonism and seems to be specific and related to the disease-specific pathological features.",

    "abstract": "\u00a0Multiple genetic and environmental factors interact to determine an individual's predisposition to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its phenotypic characteristics. Association studies have found a number of alleles associated with the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Our aim was to investigate whether multiple risk-associated alleles may be present in affected monozygotic twins, indicating underlying genetic predisposition to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. We determined the genotype of 14 candidate gene polymorphisms (at 11 unlinked loci) in a set of monozygotic twins who presented with cirrhosis within 18 months of each other. Genotyping revealed multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms at 9 independent loci in genes PNPLA3, APOC3, GCKR, TRIB1, LYPLAL1, PPP1R3B, COL13A1, and EFCAB4B, previously implicated in contributing to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis pathogenesis. In conclusion, this case series illustrates the potential cumulative effect of multiple polymorphisms in the development and potential progression of a complex trait such as NASH cirrhosis.",

    "abstract": "Progressive fetal growth restriction (FGR) is often an indication for delivery. In dichorionic diamniotic (DD) twin pregnancy with growth restriction only affecting one fetus (selective fetal growth restriction: sFGR), the normal twin is also delivered prematurely. There is still not enough evidence about the optimal timing of delivery for DD twins with sFGR in relation to discordance and gestational age. We report three sets of DD twins with sFGR (almost complete growth arrest affecting one fetus for \u22652 weeks) before 30 weeks of gestation. The interval from growth arrest to delivery was 21-24 days and the discordance was 33.7-49.8%. A large-scale study showed no difference of overall mortality or the long-term outcome between immediate and delayed delivery for FGR, while many studies have identified a risk of developmental delay following delivery of the normal growth fetus before 32 weeks. Therefore, delivery of DD twins with sFGR should be delayed if the condition of the sFGR fetus permits in order to increase the gestational age of the normal growth fetus.",

The etiology of neonatal hemochromatosis is not exactly understood. However, according to one theory neonatal hemochromatosis is believed to be an alloimmune disorder causing liver injury in the fetus. In order to diagnose neonatal hemochromatosis there are some criteria that should be taken into account, such as positive family history, high serum ferritin levels, high serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and siderosis demonstrated by histology or with magnetic resonance.We present a case of a monochorionic newborn twin who applied to our hospital with sepsis clinical symptoms like clinics, was diagnosed with NH and immediately treated with antioxidant therapy while the other twin with same clinical symptoms did not respond to therapy and passed away. NH should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases with sepsis-like clinical symptoms that do not respond to antibiotics; early antioxidant therapy in these cases is lifesaving.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the gene-environment interaction of physical activity and body mass index (BMI) using the Chinese National Twin Registry (CNTR).\nA total of 19,308 same-sex adult twins from CNTR were included in the analysis. Twin zygosity was determined by self-reported questionnaire. Height and weight were measured using self-reported questionnaire. The vigorous physical activity was defined as greater or equal to five times a week of at least 30 min moderate- or high-intensity physical activity. A twin structural equation model was used to analyze the gene-environment interaction of vigorous exercise with BMI among 13,506 monozygotic twins and 5,802 dizygotic twins.\nA structural equation model adjusting for age and sex found vigorous exercise significantly moderated the additive genetic effects (P < 0.001) and shared environmental effects (P < 0.001) on BMI. The genetic contributions to BMI were significantly lower for people who adopted a physically active lifestyle [h(2) = 40%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 35%-46%] than those who were relative sedentary (h(2) = 59%, 95% CI: 52%-66%). The observed gene-physical activity interaction was more pronounced in men than women.\nOur results suggested that adopting a physically active lifestyle may help to reduce the genetic influence on BMI among the Chinese population.",

In addition, twins sharing the same placenta are at risk for developing specific conditions that are potentially amenable to surgical management. In those scenarios, patients might need to be evaluated not only with US but with fetal MRI as well.

    "abstract": "Studies of maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) suggest increased risk for cognitive impairment and psychiatric outcomes. However, it is uncertain whether these associations are the direct result of MSDP or related to confounding familial variables associated with MSDP. The current study employed propensity score analysis to examine the effects of MSDP on offspring EXT using data from a large sample of 979 unrelated mothers. Logistic regression models were used to determine the propensity that the offspring of these mothers were likely to be exposed to MSDP [i.e., smoked during only the first trimester (MSDP-EARLY[E]) or smoked throughout their pregnancy (MSDP-THROUGHOUT[T])] given known familial confounders. Analyses focused on the effect of MSDP-E/T on the EXT behavior in offspring of these mothers (N\u00a0=\u00a01616) were conducted across the distribution of liability for MSDP-E/T and at different levels of risk for MSDP-E/T. MSDP-E/T was associated with offspring EXT problems, but the effects were partly confounded by the familial liability for MSDP. Further, the observed effects were not consistent across all levels of the MSDP risk distribution. These findings suggest a direct association between MSDP and offspring EXT behaviors, and that varied associations observed across studies may be the result of differences in the level of familial confounders that also have an effect on offspring EXT.",

    "abstract": "An adaptive immunological response to microbial antigens has been observed in Crohn's disease (CD). Intriguingly, this serological response precedes the diagnosis in some patients and has also been observed in healthy relatives. We aimed to determine whether genetic factors are implicated in this response in a CD twin cohort.\nIn total, 82 twin pairs (Leuven n = 13, Maastricht n = 8, \u00d6rebro n = 61) took part: 81 pairs with CD (concordant monozygotic n = 16, discordant monozygotic n = 22, concordant dizygotic n = 3, discordant dizygotic n = 40) and 1 monozygotic pair with both CD and ulcerative colitis. Serology for Pseudomonas fluorescens-related protein (anti-I2), Escherichia coli outer membrane porin C (anti-OmpC), CBir1flagellin (anti-CBir1) and antibodies to oligomannan (anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody [ASCA]) was determined by standardized enzyme-linked immunoassay.\nAll markers were more often present in CD twins than in their healthy twin siblings. Using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), agreements in concentrations of anti-OmpC and anti-I2 were observed in discordant monozygotic but not in discordant dizygotic twin pairs with CD (anti-OmpC, ICC 0.80 and -0.02, respectively) and (anti-I2, ICC 0.56 and 0.05, respectively). In contrast, no agreements were found in anti-CBir, immunoglobulin (Ig) G ASCA and ASCA IgA.\nWe show that anti-I2 and anti-CBir1 statuses have specificity for CD and confirm previous reported specificities for anti-OmpC and ASCA. Based on quantitative analyses and observed ICCs, genetics seems to predispose to the anti-OmpC and anti-I2 response but less to ASCA and anti-CBir1 responses.",

    "abstract": "By and large, studies have reported moderate contributions of genetic factors to cortisol secreted in the early morning and even smaller estimates later in the day. In contrast, the cortisol awakening response (CAR) has shown much stronger heritability estimates, which prompted the hypothesis that the etiology of cortisol secretion may vary according to the time of day. A direct test of this possibility has, however, not yet been performed.\nTo describe the specific and common etiology of the CAR, awakening level and cortisol change from morning to evening in an age-homogenous sample of twin adolescents.\nA total of 592 participants of the Qu\u00e9bec Newborn Twin Study, a population-based 1995-1998 cohort of families with twins in Canada, have collected saliva at awakening, 30 min later, at the end of afternoon and in the evening over four collection days.\nMultivariate Cholesky models showed both specific and common sources of variance between the CAR, awakening and cortisol diurnal change. The CAR had the strongest heritability estimates, which, for the most part, did not overlap with the other indicators. Conversely, similar magnitudes of genetic and environmental contributions were detected at awakening and for diurnal change, which partially overlapped.\nOur study unraveled differences between the latent etiologies of the CAR and the rest of the diurnal cycle, which may contribute to identify regulatory genes and environments and detangle how these indicators each relate to physical and mental health.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the influence of unfavorable intrauterine conditions and catch-up growth, we analyzed growth and pubertal maturation in monozygotic twins with significant intra-twin birthweight differences.\nProspective longitudinal clinical study of 30 twin pairs at birth, prepubertally at ages 2.1, 4.0, 10.0 years, and mid-/postpubertally at age 14.6 years; 14 pairs were concordant (birthweight difference <1 SDS), 16 discordant (birthweight difference >1 SDS).\nIn 19/30 (63%) pairs, the initially smaller twin started pubertal maturation before the co-twin. In 7/8 (88%) female discordant twin pairs, the initially smaller twin experienced menarche first. Among discordant pairs, highly significant intra-twin differences for height SDS were observed up to 10 years of age, with a further decline between ages 10.0 and 14.6 years. At 10.0 years of age, significant intra-twin differences in mean dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate were observed in all twin pairs (870.3 vs 1054 ng/mL in the smaller twin, P = .045). This was pronounced in the discordant group: 856.7 vs 1138.2 ng/mL, P = .009. In all twin pairs, highly significant intra-twin correlations were found for gonadotropins during puberty (luteinizing hormone: r = 0.67, P < .001. follicle stimulating hormone: r = 0.70, P < .001) with no significant intra-twin differences for gonadotropins, estradiol, and testosterone before or during puberty.\nBirthweight has an impact on growth and pubertal maturation. The already decreased height in some low birthweight infants may be further impacted by an early start and fast progression of puberty. The high intra-twin correlation coefficients in our study suggest that puberty and sexual steroids are genetically determined. However, the observed adrenal androgen hypersecretion of the smaller twin during late childhood could have effected pubertal maturation and further decreased near final height.",

    "abstract": "Although the genetics of asthma has been extensively studied using both quantitative and molecular genetic analysis methods, both approaches lack studies specific to the childhood phenotype and including other allergic diseases. This study aimed to give specific estimates for the heritability of childhood asthma and other allergic diseases, to attempt to replicate findings from genomewide association studies (GWAS) for childhood asthma and to test the same variants against other allergic diseases.\nIn a cohort of 25 306 Swedish twins aged 9 or 12 years, data on asthma were available from parental interviews and population-based registers. The interviews also inquired about wheeze, hay fever, eczema, and food allergy. Through structural equation modeling, the heritability of all phenotypes was calculated. A subset of 10 075 twins was genotyped for 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from previous GWAS; these were first tested for association with asthma and significant findings also against the other allergic diseases.\nThe heritability of any childhood asthma was 0.82 (95% CI 0.79-0.85). For the other allergic diseases, the range was approximately 0.60-0.80.

    "abstract": "Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is common, but it remains unclear whether there are long-term adverse cognitive effects of surgery combined with anesthesia. The authors examined the association between exposure to surgery and level of cognitive functioning in a sample of 8,503 middle-aged and elderly twins.\nResults from five cognitive tests were compared in twins exposed to surgery, classified as major, minor, hip and knee replacement, or other, with those of a reference group without surgery using linear regression adjusted for sex and age. Genetic and shared environmental confounding was addressed in intrapair analyses of 87 monozygotic and 124 dizygotic same-sexed twin pairs in whom one had a history of major surgery and the other did not.\nStatistically significantly lower composite cognitive score was found in twins with at least one major surgery compared with the reference group (mean difference, -0.27; 95% CI, -0.48 to -0.06), corresponding to one tenth of an SD, that is, a negligible effect size. In the intrapair analysis, the surgery-exposed co-twin had the lower cognitive score in 49% (95% CI, 42 to 56%) of the pairs. None of the other groups differed from the reference group except the knee and hip replacement group that tended to have higher cognitive scores (mean difference, 0.35; 95% CI, -0.18 to 0.87).\nA history of major surgery was associated with a negligibly lower level of cognitive functioning. The supplementary analyses suggest that preoperative cognitive functioning and underlying diseases were more important for cognitive functioning in mid- and late life than surgery and anesthesia.",

    "abstract": "Genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D) is well supported by epidemiologic evidence; however, disease risk cannot be entirely explained by established genetic variants identified so far. This study addresses the question of whether epigenetic modification of the inherited DNA sequence may contribute to T1D susceptibility. Using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (450k), a total of seven long-term disease-discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and five pairs of HLA-identical, disease-discordant non-twin siblings (NTS) were examined for associations between DNA methylation (DNAm) and T1D. Strong evidence for global hypomethylation of CpG sites within promoter regions in MZ twins with TID compared to twins without T1D was observed. DNA methylation data were then grouped into three categories of CpG sites for further analysis, including those within: 1) the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, 2) non-MHC genes with reported T1D association through genome wide association studies (GWAS), and 3) the epigenome, or remainder of sites that did not include MHC and T1D associated genes. Initial results showed modest methylation differences between discordant MZ twins for the MHC region and T1D-associated CpG sites, BACH2, INS-IGF2, and CLEC16A (DNAm difference range: 2.2%-5.0%). In the epigenome CpG set, the greatest methylation differences were observed in MAGI2, FANCC, and PCDHB16, (DNAm difference range: 6.9%-16.1%). These findings were not observed in the HLA-identical NTS pairs. Targeted pyrosequencing of five candidate CpG loci identified using the 450k array in the original discordant MZ twins produced similar results using control DNA samples, indicating strong agreement between the two DNA methylation profiling platforms. However, findings for the top five candidate CpG loci were not replicated in six additional T1D-discordant MZ twin pairs. Our results indicate global DNA hypomethylation within gene promoter regions may contribute to T1D; however, findings do not support the involvement of large DNAm differences at single CpG sites alone in T1D.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the association between anxiety-depression and 5-HTTLPR gene polymorphism in school-aged twins.\nA total of 147 pairs of twins (47 pairs of monozygotic twins, 100 pairs of dizygotic twins) aged 8-12 years from Baotou and Hohhot were selected as respondents. The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to calculate the scores of anxiety-depression factors in school-aged twins. The DNA was extracted from oral epithelial cells, and polymerase chain reaction was applied for 5-HTTLPR genotyping. The generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to analyze the effect of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and family environment on anxiety-depression in school-aged twins.\nThe children with LS and SS genotypes had significantly higher scores of anxiety-depression factors than those with LL genotype (\u03c72=3.938, P<0.05). The interaction of 5-HTTLPR genotype with family cohesion and family rearing patterns had a significant impact on the scores of anxiety-depression factors in twins (\u03c72=6.129 and 7.665, both P<0.05).\n5-HTTLPR genotype is significantly correlated with the scores of anxiety-depression factors in school-aged twins. In the family with high cohesion and an autocratic family rearing pattern, S allele may increase the possibility of anxiety-depression in twin children.\n\u4e86\u89e35-HTTLPR\u57fa\u56e0\u591a\u6001\u6027\u4e0e\u5b66\u9f84\u53cc\u751f\u5b50\u513f\u7ae5\u7126\u8651\u6291\u90c1\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\n\u9009\u53d6\u5185\u8499\u53e4\u547c\u548c\u6d69\u7279\u5e02\u548c\u5305\u5934\u5e028~12\u5c81147\u5bf9\u53cc\u751f\u5b50\u513f\u7ae5(\u540c\u5375\u53cc\u751f\u5b5047\u5bf9; \u5f02\u5375\u53cc\u751f\u5b50100\u5bf9)\u4e3a\u8c03\u67e5\u5bf9\u8c61, \u8fd0\u7528Achenbach\u513f\u7ae5\u884c\u4e3a\u91cf\u8868(CBCL)\u6d4b\u7b97\u513f\u7ae5\u7126\u8651\u6291\u90c1\u56e0\u5b50\u5f97\u5206; \u91c7\u96c6\u6240\u6709\u513f\u7ae5\u53e3\u8154\u4e0a\u76ae\u7ec6\u80de\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6DNA, \u8fd0\u7528\u805a\u5408\u9176\u94fe\u5f0f\u53cd\u5e94(PCR)\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf95-HTTLPR\u57fa\u56e0\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u578b; \u5229\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u7a0b(GEE)\u5206\u67905-HTTLPR\u57fa\u56e0\u591a\u6001\u6027\u53ca\u5bb6\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u5b66\u9f84\u53cc\u751f\u5b50\u513f\u7ae5\u7126\u8651\u6291\u90c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\nLS\u548cSS\u57fa\u56e0\u578b\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u7126\u8651\u6291\u90c1\u56e0\u5b50\u5f97\u5206\u9ad8\u4e8eLL\u57fa\u56e0\u578b\u513f\u7ae5(\n5-HTTLPR\u57fa\u56e0\u578b\u4e0e\u5b66\u9f84\u53cc\u751f\u5b50\u513f\u7ae5\u7126\u8651\u6291\u90c1\u56e0\u5b50\u5f97\u5206\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173; \u5728\u9ad8\u4eb2\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u4e13\u5236\u578b\u6559\u517b\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u4e2d, S\u7b49\u4f4d\u57fa\u56e0\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u53cc\u751f\u5b50\u513f\u7ae5\u7126\u8651\u6291\u90c1\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002",

    "abstract": "We estimated the temporal course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Vietnam-era veterans using a national sample of male twins with a 20-year follow-up. The complete sample included those twins with a PTSD diagnostic assessment in 1992 and who completed a DSM-IV PTSD diagnostic assessment and a self-report PTSD checklist in 2012 (n = 4,138). Using PTSD diagnostic data, we classified veterans into 5 mutually exclusive groups, including those who never had PTSD, and 4 PTSD trajectory groups: (a) early recovery, (b) late recovery, (c) late onset, and (d) chronic. The majority of veterans remained unaffected by PTSD throughout their lives (79.05% of those with theater service, 90.85% of those with nontheater service); however, an important minority (10.50% of theater veterans, 4.45% of nontheater veterans) in 2012 had current PTSD that was either late onset (6.55% theater, 3.29% nontheater) or chronic (3.95% theater, 1.16% nontheater). The distribution of trajectories was significantly different by theater service (p < .001). PTSD remains a prominent issue for many Vietnam-era veterans, especially for those who served in Vietnam.",

    "abstract": "Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1) is a major inhibitor of Wnt signalling pathway but also plays an important role in bone formation. Its circulating levels appear to correlate significantly with plasma levels of inflammatory factors, fractalkine and IL-6. This study, using a large sample of UK twins, showed that the variation of each of these factors and correlation between them was explained by the genetic factors, and indicated possible association with DKK1 gene variants.\nDKK1 is involved in the development of several inflammatory conditions related to bone and joint degradation. Our objectives were to explore the genetic contribution (heritability) to circulating DKK1 variation and its correlation with other inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and fractalkine, and to test whether the DKK1 heritability could be attributable to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapped to DKK1, IL-6 and FRCT genes.\nThe study included a large community-based sample of 4939 women drawn from the general UK population. Plasma samples were analysed for circulating levels of DKK1, IL-6 and fractalkine (FRCT); 65 SNPs of DKK1, IL-6 and FRCT candidate genes, with MAF >0.1, were examined. We applied variance component analysis to evaluate contribution of putative genetic (including above SNPs) and environmental factors to variation of DKK1, and its correlation with IL-6 and FRCT.\nPutative genetic factors explained 42.2\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0% of the total variation of circulating DKK1 levels, and were also significant for fractalkine and IL-6 variations. Most importantly, we report significant phenotypic (0.208\u2009\u00b1\u20090.006-0.459\u2009\u00b1\u20090.007) and genetic (0.338\u2009\u00b1\u20090.069-0.617\u2009\u00b1\u20090.033) correlations between these molecules. We found evidence suggestive of association between the DKK1 and its structural genes variants.\nCirculating DKK1 levels correlated significantly with levels of IL-6 and FRCT, known risk factors for several inflammatory processes suggesting a potential role of DKK1 in inflammation and tissue injury. Our results suggest the contribution of genetic factors in inter-individual variation of DKK1 levels in human population. However, further studies are required to determine genetic polymorphisms affecting DKK1 variation and its correlation with IL-6 and FRCT.",

    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders include a broad spectrum of conditions, which are characterized by delayed motor and/or cognitive milestones and by a variable range of intellectual disability with or without an autistic behavior. Several genetic factors have been implicated in intellectual disability onset and exome sequencing studies have recently identified new inherited or de novo mutations in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders.\nWe report the case of two monozygotic twins who came for the first time to our attention at the age of 20months for a global neurodevelopmental delay associated with an autism spectrum disorder, hypotonia, postnatal microcephaly, stereotypic movements and circadian rhythm alterations in association with late-onset epilepsy. MECP2 sequence was normal. A CGH-array analysis revealed in both twins two maternally inherited duplications on chromosomes 8p22 and 16p13.11. The latter has been previously associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. We performed an exome sequencing analysis on one twin and her parents and identified a CHD2 mutation, previously described in association with a phenotypic spectrum overlapping our patients' phenotype.\nThis work underlines the importance to consider a CHD2 involvement in children with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder even in the absence of epilepsy at an early age. It also highlights the necessity to re-evaluate inherited copy number variants with low penetrance and/or high phenotypic variability because an underlying de novo molecular event can be the major cause of the phenotype. This is essential in order to reach a correct diagnosis and provide the couple with a proper recurrence risk.",

    "abstract": "Estimates of familial cancer risk from population-based studies are essential components of cancer risk prediction.\nTo estimate familial risk and heritability of cancer types in a large twin cohort.\nProspective study of 80,309 monozygotic and 123,382 same-sex dizygotic twin individuals (N\u2009=\u2009203,691) within the population-based registers of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. Twins were followed up a median of 32 years between 1943 and 2010. There were 50,990 individuals who died of any cause, and 3804 who emigrated and were lost to follow-up.\nShared environmental and heritable risk factors among pairs of twins.\nThe main outcome was incident cancer. Time-to-event analyses were used to estimate familial risk (risk of cancer in an individual given a twin's development of cancer) and heritability (proportion of variance in cancer risk due to interindividual genetic differences) with follow-up via cancer registries. Statistical models adjusted for age and follow-up time, and accounted for censoring and competing risk of death.\nA total of 27,156 incident cancers were diagnosed in 23,980 individuals, translating to a cumulative incidence of 32%. Cancer was diagnosed in both twins among 1383 monozygotic (2766 individuals) and 1933 dizygotic (2866 individuals) pairs. Of these, 38% of monozygotic and 26% of dizygotic pairs were diagnosed with the same cancer type. There was an excess cancer risk in twins whose co-twin was diagnosed with cancer, with estimated cumulative risks that were an absolute 5% (95% CI, 4%-6%) higher in dizygotic (37%; 95% CI, 36%-38%) and an absolute 14% (95% CI, 12%-16%) higher in monozygotic twins (46%; 95% CI, 44%-48%) whose twin also developed cancer compared with the cumulative risk in the overall cohort (32%). For most cancer types, there were significant familial risks and the cumulative risks were higher in monozygotic than dizygotic twins. Heritability of cancer overall was 33% (95% CI, 30%-37%). Significant heritability was observed for the cancer types of skin melanoma (58%; 95% CI, 43%-73%), prostate (57%; 95% CI, 51%-63%), nonmelanoma skin (43%; 95% CI, 26%-59%), ovary (39%; 95% CI, 23%-55%), kidney (38%; 95% CI, 21%-55%), breast (31%; 95% CI, 11%-51%), and corpus uteri (27%; 95% CI, 11%-43%).\nIn this long-term follow-up study among Nordic twins, there was significant excess familial risk for cancer overall and for specific types of cancer, including prostate, melanoma, breast, ovary, and uterus. This information about hereditary risks of cancers may be helpful in patient education and cancer risk counseling.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that ovarian stimulation and assisted reproductive techniques (ART) may increase the frequency of monozygotic twins. In this article, we present the analysis of the estimated frequency of twin deliveries following in vitro fertilization (IVF) in Lombardy during the period 2010-2014 for a total of 450,949 pregnancies.\nThis is a population-based study using data from the regional data base of Lombardy, a northern Italian region with a population of about 10 million inhabitants. During the considered period, a total of 461,424 single or multiple births were registered in Lombardy. After exclusion of triplets or more pregnancies, the total number of twin deliveries, in separate strata of like and unlike sex pregnancies twin deliveries, were obtained and the rate of twin deliveries was computed according to spontaneous and non-spontaneous conception and type of ART. Further, estimates of dizygotic or monozygotic twin births were calculated using Weinberg's methods.\nThe frequency of twins deliveries was 1.24/100 deliveries after natural conception and 20.05 after assisted conception. The estimated rates of monozygotic twins was 0.45 and 0.72/100 (95% CI: 0.58-0.91) deliveries after natural and assisted conception, respectively. This difference was statistically significant (p < .05).\nthe present population based study suggests that the risk of monozygotic twin is about 60% higher among assisted than after natural conception.",

    "abstract": "Neural responses to highly energetic food cues are robust and are suppressed by eating. It is not known if neural responsiveness to food cues is an inherited trait and possibly even one that mediates the genetic influences on body weight that have been previously observed.\nWe investigated the inherited influence on brain responses to high-calorie visual food cues before and after a meal.\nWith the use of a monozygotic twin study design, 21 healthy monozygotic twin pairs consumed a standardized breakfast and, 3.5 h later, underwent the first of 2 functional MRI (fMRI) scans with the use of visual food cues. After the first fMRI session, twins consumed a standardized meal, which was followed by the second fMRI. Serial ratings of appetite and food appeal were obtained. An ad libitum buffet was used to measure total caloric and macronutrient intakes. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) were used to test for inherited influences by comparing whether intrapair similarity was greater than interpair similarity.\nBody mass index was highly correlated within twin pairs (ICC: 0.96; P < 0.0001). ICCs also showed a strong intrapair similarity for the meal-induced change in hunger (ICC: 0.41; P = 0.03), fullness (ICC: 0.39; P = 0.04), and the appeal of fattening food (ICC: 0.57; P < 0.001). Twins ate a similar number of kilocalories at the buffet (ICC: 0.43; P = 0.02). Before the meal, the global brain activation across regions involved in satiety processing was not more similar in twins than in unrelated individuals. However, significant ICCs were present after the meal (ICC: 0.39; P = 0.04) and for the meal-induced change in activation by high-calorie visual food cues (ICC: 0.52; P < 0.01).\nInherited factors influence both satiety perception and the effect of a meal to alter regional brain responses to images of highly energetic food. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02483663.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic monochorionic triplet pregnancy with conjoined twins is a very rare condition and is associated with many complications.\nIn this study, we describe a monochorionic-diamniotic triplet pregnancy after in vitro fertilization with an intracytoplasmic sperm injection. At a gestational age of 6 weeks and 4 days of pregnancy one gestational sac was observed, and at a gestational age of 12 weeks and 2 days, triplets with conjoined twins were diagnosed. After consulting with the parents, they chose fetal reduction of the conjoined twins. Selective feticide was successfully performed by radiofrequency ablation at 16 weeks of pregnancy. Unfortunately, the day after the procedure, the membrane ruptured, and 1 week later, all fetuses and placenta were spontaneously aborted.\nMonochorionic triplet pregnancy with conjoined twins is very rare. These pregnancies are associated with very serious complications. Intra cytoplasmic sperm injection increases the rate of monozygotic twinning and conjoined twins. Counseling with parents before IVF is very important.",

The rupture of the spleen can also be caused by infectious diseases (mononucleosis), hematologic diseases (Non-Hodgin Lymphoma), rheumatologic diseases (Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis) or diseases of the spleen (splenic hemangioma, splenic artery aneurysm). Also the spontaneous rupture of the spleen can occur. In the literature we can find descriptions of the spontaneous splenic rupture during pregnancy and puerperium period. In the differential diagnosis of the bleeding into the peritoneal cavity, all possible causes, including those less frequent as spontaneous rupture of the spleen, should be taken into account. In the presented case report we describe the case of splenic rupture after caesarean section performed on a woman in a twin pregnancy with HELLP syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Few large epidemiologic studies have investigated the role of postweaning protein intake in excess weight and adiposity of young children, despite children in the United Kingdom consistently consuming protein in excess of their physiologic requirements.\nWe investigated whether a higher proportion of protein intake from energy beyond weaning is associated with greater weight gain, higher body mass index (BMI), and risk of overweight or obesity in children up to 5 y of age.\nParticipants were 2154 twins from the Gemini cohort. Dietary intake was collected by using a 3-d diet diary when the children had a mean age of 21 mo. Weight and height were collected every 3 mo, from birth to 5 y. Longitudinal models investigated associations of protein intake with BMI, weight, and height, with adjustment for age at diet diary, sex, total energy intake, birth weight/length, and rate of prior growth and clustering within families. Logistic regression investigated protein intake in relation to the odds of overweight or obesity at 3 and 5 y of age.\nA total of 2154 children had a mean \u00b1 SD of 5.7 \u00b1 3.2 weight and height measurements up to 5 y. Total energy from protein was associated with higher BMI (\u03b2 = 0.043; 95% CI: 0.011, 0.075) and weight (\u03b2 = 0.052; 95% CI: 0.031, 0.074) but not height (\u03b2 = 0.088; 95% CI: -0.038, 0.213) between 21 mo and 5 y. Substituting percentage energy from fat or carbohydrate for percentage energy from protein was associated with decreases in BMI and weight. Protein intake was associated with a trend in increased odds of overweight or obesity at 3 y (OR = 1.10; 95% CI 0.99, 1.22, P = 0.075), but the effect was not statistically significant at 5 y.\nA higher proportion of energy from protein during the complementary feeding stage is associated with greater increases in weight and BMI in early childhood in this large cohort of United Kingdom children.",

    "abstract": "Research supporting relationships between sleep quality, weight, depression and anxiety has typically examined the relationships separately rather than simultaneously, potentially hampering insights into the characteristics of reported links. This study aimed to fill this gap in the research to provide further insight into the factors associated with sleep.\nData from wave 4 of the G1219 cohort were used in cross-sectional analyses. The sample comprised 1392 adult twins and siblings aged 18-27 years. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire which included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index as a measure of sleep quality, the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire as a measure of depression symptoms and the Revised Symptoms of Anxiety Scale as a measure of anxiety symptoms. Participants were asked to self-report general health and weight and height so researchers could derive weight status from measures of body mass index.\nAn analysis of covariance including weight status, depression, anxiety and general health as predictors and sleep quality as the outcome revealed main effects of depression (F(3,1163)\u2009=\u200910.93, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and general health (F(4,1163)\u2009=\u20095.72, p\u2009<\u20090.001) only.\nA direct relationship between weight and sleep should not be assumed as it is possible that the relationship is at least in part accounted for by depression symptoms or general health. Depression symptoms and general health may also account for the association between sleep quality and anxiety symptoms in young adults.",

    "abstract": "Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk of problematic alcohol and other substance use in adolescence. This study used data from an ongoing, prospective, population-based twin study of Swedish children and adolescents to evaluate the extent to which the association between ADHD symptoms and alcohol problems reflects a unique source of genetic or environmental risk related to ADHD versus a broader predisposition to youth externalizing behavior. We used all available data from same-sex monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins on ADHD symptoms in childhood (age 9/12; N\u2009=\u200915,549) and alcohol problems in late adolescence (age 18; N\u2009=\u20092,564). Consistent with prior longitudinal studies, the phenotypic association between hyperactive/impulsive ADHD symptoms and alcohol problems was small in magnitude, whereas the association for inattentive symptoms was even weaker. Additive genetic influences explained 99.8% of the association between hyperactive/impulsive symptoms and alcohol problems. Furthermore, we found that the genetic risk specifically associated with hyperactive/impulsive symptoms was attenuated when estimated in the context of externalizing behavior liability during childhood, of which ADHD symptoms were specific expressions. In sensitivity analyses exploring hyperactivity in mid-adolescence, we found a similar pattern of genetic associations. These results are consistent with previous findings of genetically driven overlap in the etiology of ADHD and problematic alcohol use. At least some of this co-occurrence may result from a general predisposition to externalizing behaviors in youth. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Primary and secondary outcomes included mode of delivery, birthweight, stillbirth, Apgar score, neonatal unit admission, neonatal resuscitation, death and respiratory distress.\nOf 1261 women, 82.9% (1045/1261; 2090 babies) delivered at \u226532 weeks' gestation. The mode of delivery for these babies was as follows: normal vaginal delivery, 419 (20%); instrumental delivery, 179 (8.6%); emergency cesarean section, 658 (31.5%); and elective cesarean section, 834 (39.9%). Babies delivered by emergency cesarean section or instrumental vaginal delivery had worse outcome. In contrast, the lowest complications were seen in the uncomplicated vaginal delivery and elective cesarean section cohorts.\nNeonatal outcome was worse for those delivering via emergency cesarean section or instrumental vaginal delivery compared with elective cesarean section or uncomplicated vaginal delivery. The rate of uncomplicated vaginal delivery, however, was low, with only 14.8% of women delivering both babies vaginally without any form of intervention.",

    "abstract": "Many infertile couples request a multiple embryo transfer because they desire more than one child. Based on this consideration, the current study aimed to compare the reproductive and perinatal outcomes of two consecutive singleton pregnancies versus one twin pregnancy in a large cohort of in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients.\nRetrospective analysis of data from patients with clinical twin pregnancy after IVF fresh cycles and from patients with two consecutive IVF fresh cycles and clinical singleton pregnancy.\nMiscarriage rate, delivery rate, gestational age at birth, neonatal birth weight, and perinatal complications. A sub-analysis of data according to vanishing twin syndrome (VTS) was also performed.\nA total of 18,703 autologous fresh cycles were analyzed. One hundred seven patients had two consecutive singleton clinical pregnancies, whereas one clinical twin pregnancy occurred in 641 women. In patients who had two consecutive singleton clinical pregnancies the rates of overall pregnancies lost (odds ratio [OR] 4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.4, 6.9) and live births (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1, 0.3) were, respectively, higher and lower when compared to patients who had one clinical twin pregnancy. That data did not change after sub-analysis for VTS. The overall risk of perinatal complications was significantly higher in patients who had one twin delivery rather than patients who had two consecutive singleton deliveries (OR 31.8, 95% CI 14.1, 71.5). No difference between groups was detected in terms of intrauterine/neonatal deaths, perinatal mortality and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Data did not change after adjusting for confounders.\nWhen compared with two consecutive singleton pregnancies, twin pregnancies are characterized by higher success rates but worse perinatal outcomes irrespectively of VTS. Well designed prospective controlled studies are needed to confirm or rebut current retrospective findings.",

    "abstract": "A twin is defined as being an external operation between two identical crystals that share a fraction of the atomic structure with no discontinuity from one crystal to the other. This includes merohedral twins, twins by reticular merohedry as well as coherent twins by contact where only the habit plane is shared by the two adjacent crystals (epitaxy). Interesting and original cases appear when the invariant substructure is built with positions belonging to the same {\\bb Z}-module as, for example, the quinary twin structure first drawn by Albrecht D\u00fcrer [(1525). The Painter's Manual: a Manual of Measurement of Lines, Areas and Solids by Means of Compass and Ruler. Facsimile Edition (1977), translated with commentary by W. L. Strauss. New York: Abaris Books]. This paper will show that the D\u00fcrer twins, once defined in five-dimensional space, are simple merohedral twins, in the sense of Georges Friedel, leaving the five-dimensional lattice invariant. This analysis will be generalized to some other higher-order {\\bb Z}-modules.",

    "abstract": "Alteration of DNA methylation in mammalian cells could be elicited by many factors, including viral infections [1]. HIV has shown the ability to interact with host cellular factors to change the methylation status of some genes [2], [3], [4]. However, the change of the DNA methylation associated with HIV infection based on the whole genome has not been well illustrated. In this study, a unique pair of monozygotic twins was recruited: one of the twins was infected with HIV without further anti-retroviral therapy while the other one was healthy, which could be considered as a relatively ideal model for profiling the alterations of DNA methylation associated with HIV infection. Therefore, using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-microarray method (MeDIP-microarray), we found the increased DNA methylation level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV infected twin compared to her normal sibling. Moreover, several distinguished differential methylation regions (DMRs) in HIV infected twin worth further study. The raw data has been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets with reference number GSE68028.",

    "abstract": "The possible pathophysiology of the relationship between gastro-esophageal reflux disease and apnea of prematurity has been widely investigated. Various physiological protective reflex responses provide a plausible biological link between gastro-esophageal reflux and apnea of prematurity. It is uncertain whether or not there is a causal relationship between the two diseases. PATIENT'S FINDINGS: Twins were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit due to feeding problems. Physical examination was normal except for reticulated, blueviolet skin changes. Short apneic attacks occurred on the first day in twin 1 and on the second day in twin 2, and these were initially treated by stimulation and increased ambient O2 concentration. Then, we conducted methylxanthine and continuous positive airway pressure treatment. Laboratory and radiological analysis were normal. As gastro-esophageal reflux disease was thought to be the causes of the treatment-refractory apnea, therapy with gaviscon and domperidon was begun for both cases. Apneic attacks did not recur after gaviscon and domperidon therapy.\nPharmacological therapy for gastro-esophageal reflux disease has not definitively been shown to be effective in improving symptoms and hence, should be reserved especially for infants with treatment refractory apnea episodes suspected as being gastro-esophageal reflux in premature infants.\n\u80cc\u666f\uff1a\u80c3\u98df\u7ba1\u53cd\u6d41\u75c5\u548c\u65e9\u4ea7\u513f\u547c\u5438\u6682\u505c\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb \u7814\u7a76\u3002\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u7406\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\u53cd\u5c04\u5e94\u7b54\u4e3a\u80c3\u98df\u7ba1\u53cd\u6d41\u548c\u65e9\u4ea7\u513f\u547c\u5438\u6682\u505c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408 \u7406\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u4e8c\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u5c1a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u3002\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3 \u679c\uff1a\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u56e0\u4e3a\u5582\u517b\u95ee\u9898\u88ab\u9001\u8fdb\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u91cd\u75c7\u76d1\u62a4\u75c5\u623f\uff0c\u4f53\u683c\u68c0\u67e5\u53d1\u73b0\u9664\u4e86\u7f51 \u72b6\u84dd\u7d2b\u8272\u76ae\u80a4\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u5176\u5b83\u6b63\u5e38\u3002\u53cc\u80de\u80ce1 \u548c\u53cc\u80de\u80ce2 \u5206\u522b\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u5929\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5929\u53d1 \u751f\u4e86\u77ed\u6682\u7684\u547c\u5438\u6682\u505c\u3002\u6700\u521d\u6211\u4eec\u91c7\u7528\u523a\u6fc0\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6c27\u6c14\u6d53\u5ea6\u6765\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u7136\u540e \u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7532\u57fa\u9ec4\u560c\u5464\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6c14\u9053\u6b63\u538b\u901a\u6c14\u6cbb\u7597\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u548c\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u5747\u6b63\u5e38\u3002\u56e0 \u4e3a\u80c3\u98df\u7ba1\u53cd\u6d41\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u96be\u6cbb\u6027\u547c\u5438\u6682\u505c\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5f00\u59cb\u7528\u5609\u80c3\u65af\u5eb7 \u548c \u591a\u6f58\u7acb\u916e \u6cbb\u7597\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5609\u80c3\u65af\u5eb7 \u548c \u591a\u6f58\u7acb\u916e\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u6ca1\u6709\u518d\u53d1\u751f\u7a92\u606f\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u80c3\u98df \u7ba1\u53cd\u6d41\u75c5\u7684\u836f\u7269\u6cbb\u7597\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u75c7\u72b6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u96be\u6cbb \u6027\u547c\u5438\u6682\u505c\u7591\u4f3c\u6709\u80c3\u98df\u7ba1\u53cd\u6d41\u7684\u65e9\u4ea7\u513f\u65f6\u5e94\u8c28\u614e\u3002.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is the most common chronic inflammatory disorder in children. The aetiology of asthma pathology is complex and highly heterogeneous, involving the interplay between genetic and environmental risk factors that is hypothesized to involve epigenetic processes. Our aim was to explore whether methylomic variation in early childhood is associated with discordance for asthma symptoms within monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs recruited from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) longitudinal twin study. We also aimed to identify differences in DNA methylation that are associated with asthma that develops in childhood and persists into early adulthood as these may represent useful prognostic biomarkers.\nWe examined genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in buccal cell samples collected from 37 MZ twin pairs discordant for asthma at age 10. DNA methylation at individual CpG sites demonstrated significant variability within discordant MZ twin pairs with the top-ranked nominally significant differentially methylated position (DMP) located in the HGSNAT gene. We stratified our analysis by assessing DNA methylation differences in a sub-group of MZ twin pairs who remained persistently discordant for asthma at age 18. The top-ranked nominally significant DMP associated with persisting asthma is located in the vicinity of the HLX gene, which has been previously implicated in childhood asthma.\nWe identified DNA methylation differences associated with childhood asthma in peripheral DNA samples from discordant MZ twin pairs. Our data suggest that differences in DNA methylation associated with childhood asthma which persists into early adulthood are distinct from those associated with asthma which remits.",

    "results": "We examined genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in buccal cell samples collected from 37 MZ twin pairs discordant for asthma at age 10. DNA methylation at individual CpG sites demonstrated significant variability within discordant MZ twin pairs with the top-ranked nominally significant differentially methylated position (DMP) located in the HGSNAT gene. We stratified our analysis by assessing DNA methylation differences in a sub-group of MZ twin pairs who remained persistently discordant for asthma at age 18. The top-ranked nominally significant DMP associated with persisting asthma is located in the vicinity of the HLX gene, which has been previously implicated in childhood asthma.",

    "abstract": "Twin pairs with the imprinting disorder Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) have rarely been reported. All six monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs described so far were clinically discordant. In two of the four SRS twin pairs with molecularly proven 11p15.5 epimutation, the healthy twin also showed the molecular alteration in blood cells, but not in the other tested tissues. The clinical discordance is a well-known but poorly understood observation because MZ twins derive from the same zygote. For the second 11p15.5-associated imprinting disorder, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a larger number of twins has been described, here the majority of pairs are MZ but clinically discordant as well. Interestingly, there is a considerable preponderance of females among the MZ twins with BWS, and a functional link between altered imprinting and X chromosome inactivation has been suggested. We now describe two further MZ SRS twins with H19/IGF2:IG-DMR hypomethylation, including the first clinically concordant pair. By summarizing the existing data, an excess of females in MZ twins with SRS is observed, thus confirming the hypothesis that X-chromosome inactivation might trigger the inaccurate methylation of imprinted loci at least in female twin conceptions. The occurrence of a MZ concordant SRS twin pair is exceptional. The detailed molecular characterization of both siblings of a twin pair enables a reliable diagnosis, furthermore it allows insights in the etiology of twinning in association with (aberrant) imprinting marking.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present work was to estimate the risk of monochorionic twin (MCT) pregnancies in in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles using data from a prenatal diagnosis unit. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study reporting on the frequency of IVF pregnancies among women attending a prenatal diagnosis service specifically dedicated to the management of monochorionic pregnancies. The observed rate was compared with the local regional rate of IVF births (2.2%). A binomial distribution model was used to calculate the 95% CI of proportions. One hundred and forty-five monochorionic pregnancies were selected. Ten of these were achieved with IVF, corresponding to a rate of 6.9% (95% CI: 3.5-11.8), significantly higher than the background rate in the local population of 2.2%. When considering exclusively monochorionic pregnancies achieving delivery of two viable newborns (n = 132), the number of IVF pregnancies was nine (6.8%, 95% CI: 3.7-12.5). We did not detect major differences in pregnancy outcome between IVF and natural monochorionic pregnancies, with the exception of the proportion of newborns with a neonatal birth < 2,500 g (100% vs. 80%, p = .03). In conclusion, data obtained from the perspective of a prenatal diagnosis unit suggest that women undergoing IVF face a 3- to 4-fold increased risk of monochorionic pregnancies.",

The mean maternal age was significantly higher in IVF compared with in spontaneously conceived pregnancies (33.8 \u00b1 5.5 vs. 31.6 \u00b1 5.4, respectively). Thirty-seven twins (11.3%) had TTTS, of whom 36/284 (12.7%) versus 1/43 (2.3%) were spontaneously and IVF conceived, respectively. The mean week of delivery was significantly lower in MC twins diagnosed with TTTS compared with those without TTTS (32.7 \u00b1 3.3 vs. 35.5 \u00b1 2.5, respectively). Furthermore, there was a significantly higher birthweight discordancy in twins diagnosed with TTTS compared with those without (20.6% vs. 11%, respectively).\nThe significantly lower proportion of TTTS found in IVF-conceived twins may suggest a different embryological process that lies at the core of IVF conception of monozygotic twinning.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences in religion are well known, with females generally being more religious than males, and shared environmental factors have been suggested to have a large influence on religiousness. Twins from opposite-sex (OS) and same-sex (SS) pairs may differ because of a dissimilar psycho-social rearing environment and/or because of different exposures to hormones in utero. We hypothesized that OS females may display more masculine patterns of religiousness and, vice versa, that OS males may display more feminine patterns. We used a web-based survey conducted in Denmark, which is a secular society. The survey included 2,997 twins aged 20-40 years, identified through the population-based Danish Twin Registry. We applied la Cour and Hvidt's adaptation of Fishman's three conceptual dimensions of meaning: Cognition, Practice, and Importance, and we used Pargament's measure of religious coping (RCOPE) for the assessment of positive and negative religious coping patterns. Differences between OS and SS twins were investigated using logistic regression for each sex. The analyses were adjusted for dependence within twin pairs. No significant differences in religiousness and religious coping were found for OS and SS twins except that more OS than SS females were members of the Danish National Evangelical Lutheran Church and fewer OS than SS females were Catholic, Muslim, or belonged to other religious denominations. Moreover, OS males at age 12 had higher rates of church attendance than did SS males. This study did not provide evidence for masculinization of female twins with male co-twins with regard to religiousness. Nor did it show any significant differences between OS and SS males except from higher rates of church attendance in childhood among males with female co-twins.",

    "abstract": "By definition, monozygotic (MZ) twins carry an identical set of genetic information. The observation of early post-twinning mutational events was shown to cause phenotypic discordance among MZ twin pairs. These mutational events comprise genomic alterations at different scales, ranging from single nucleotide changes to larger copy-number variations (CNVs) of varying sizes, as well as epigenetic changes. Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in nine discordant MZ twins to identify somatic mutational events in the affected twin that might exert a dominant negative effect. Five of these MZ twin pairs were discordant for congenital heart defects (CHD), two for endocrine disorders, one for omphalocele, and one for congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Analysis of WES data from all nine MZ twin pairs using the de novo probability tool DeNovoGear detected only one apparent de novo variation in TMPRSS13 in one of the CHD-affected twins. Analysis of WES data from all nine MZ twin pairs by using standard filter criteria without the de novo probability tool DeNovoGear revealed a total of 6,657 variations in which both the twin pairs differed. After filtering for variations only present in the affected twins and absent in in-house controls, 722 variations remained. Visual inspection for read quality decreased this number to 12, present only in the affected twin. However, Sanger sequencing of the overall 13 variations failed to confirm the variation in the affected twin. These results suggest that somatic mutational events in coding regions do not seem to play a major role in the phenotypic expression of MZ discordant twin pairs.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetics describes the study of cellular modifications that can modify the expression of genes without changing the DNA sequence. DNA methylation is one of the most stable and prevalent epigenetic mechanisms. Twin studies have been a valuable model for unraveling the genetic and epigenetic epidemiology of complex traits, and now offer a potential to dissect the factors that impact DNA methylation variability and its biomedical significance. The twin design specifically allows for the study of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors, and their potential interactions, on epigenetic profiles. Furthermore, genetically identical twins offer a unique opportunity to assess nongenetic impacts on epigenetic profiles. Here, we summarize recent findings from twin studies of DNA methylation profiles across tissues, to define current knowledge regarding the genetic and nongenetic factors that influence epigenetic variation.",

    "abstract": "Diurnal preference is an individual's preference for daily activities and sleep timing and is strongly correlated with the underlying circadian clock and the sleep-wake cycle validating its use as an indirect circadian measure in humans. Recent research has implicated DNA methylation as a mechanism involved in the regulation of the circadian clock system in humans and other mammals. In order to evaluate the extent of epigenetic differences associated with diurnal preference, we examined genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in DNA from monozygotic (MZ) twin-pairs discordant for diurnal preference. MZ twins were selected from a longitudinal twin study designed to investigate the interplay of genetic and environmental factors in the development of emotional and behavioral difficulties. Fifteen pairs of MZ twins were identified in which one member scored considerably higher on the Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) than the other. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were assessed in twins' buccal cell DNA using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Quality control and data pre-processing was undertaken using the wateRmelon package. Differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were identified using an analysis strategy taking into account both the significance and the magnitude of DNA methylation differences. Our data indicate that DNA methylation differences are detectable in MZ twins discordant for diurnal preference. Moreover, downstream gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the top-ranked diurnal preference associated DMPs revealed significant enrichment of pathways that have been previously associated with circadian rhythm regulation, including cell adhesion processes and calcium ion binding.",

    "abstract": "We examine the philosophical and ethical issues associated with conjoined twins and their surgical separation. In cases in which there is an extensive sharing of organs, but nevertheless two distinguishable functioning brains, there are a number of philosophical and ethical challenges. This is because such conjoined twins: 1. give rise to puzzles concerning our identity, about whether we are identical to something psychological or biological; 2. force us to decide whether what matters from an ethical point of view is the biological life of our organisms or the existence of our consciousness or mind; 3. raise questions concerning when, if ever, it is morally acceptable to sacrifice one of us to save another; 4. force us to reflect on the conditions for ownership of organs and the justification of removal of organs for transplantation which causes the death of the donor; 5. raise questions about who should take decisions about life-risking treatments when this cannot be decided by patients themselves. We examine and suggest answers to these questions.",

    "abstract": "Infantile systemic hyalinosis (ISH) is a rare disorder belonging to the heterogeneous group of genetic fibromatoses. It is a rare, progressive, fatal autosomal recessive condition characterized by widespread deposition of hyaline material in many tissues caused by mutations in the anthrax toxin receptor 2 gene - ANTXR2. It presents hyperpigmented skin over bony prominences. Characteristic purplish patches develop over the medial and lateral malleoli of the ankles, the metacarpophalangeal joints, spine and elbows, with progressive joint contractures, osteopenia, skin abnormalities and chronic severe pain. The present case reports the occurrence of infantile systemic hyalinosis in twin brothers five months of age who had come for early intervention for joint contractures representing characteristic brownish patches over bony prominences. ISH cases reported until this date have been less than 20 and the present case is unique in nature since this is the first time ISH is reported in twins globally and the symptoms have been identified at an early age.",

    "abstract": "Patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders (for example, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) have elevated risks of committing violent acts, particularly if they are comorbid with substance misuse. Despite recent insights from quantitative and molecular genetic studies demonstrating considerable pleiotropy in the genetic architecture of these phenotypes, there is currently a lack of large-scale studies that have specifically examined the aetiological links between psychotic disorders and violence. Using a sample of all Swedish individuals born between 1958 and 1989 (n=3 332 101), we identified a total of 923\u2009259 twin-sibling pairs. Patients were identified using the National Patient Register using validated algorithms based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 8-10. Univariate quantitative genetic models revealed that all phenotypes (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, substance misuse, and violent crime) were highly heritable (h(2)=53-71%). Multivariate models further revealed that schizophrenia was a stronger predictor of violence (r=0.32; 95% confidence interval: 0.30-0.33) than bipolar disorder (r=0.23; 0.21-0.25), and large proportions (51-67%) of these phenotypic correlations were explained by genetic factors shared between each disorder, substance misuse, and violence. Importantly, we found that genetic influences that were unrelated to substance misuse explained approximately a fifth (21%; 20-22%) of the correlation with violent criminality in bipolar disorder but none of the same correlation in schizophrenia (Pbipolar disorder<0.001; Pschizophrenia=0.55). These findings highlight the problems of not disentangling common and unique sources of covariance across genetically similar phenotypes as the latter sources may include aetiologically important clues. Clinically, these findings underline the importance of assessing risk of different phenotypes together and integrating interventions for psychiatric disorders, substance misuse, and violence.",

    "abstract": "The antenatal diagnosis of twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS) in monochorionic-diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies is based on elevated peak systolic velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA-PSV) in the donor twin and decreased MCA-PSV in the recipient twin. However, the association between these parameters and polycythemia has not yet been established. The aim of this study was to determine whether MCA-PSV can predict polycythemia in MCDA pregnancies.\nThis was a prospective cohort study of MCDA pregnancies recruited at 14-18 weeks' gestation from a single tertiary care center between January 2011 and June 2014. Fetal MCA Doppler waveforms were recorded every 2 weeks from 18 weeks' gestation until delivery. Only those with an MCA-PSV measurement within 1 week of delivery were included in the analysis. Neonatal hematocrit level was determined in all twins from venous blood obtained within 4\u2009h of delivery. Polycythemia was defined as a hematocrit of >\u200965%, and anemia as a hematocrit of <\u200945%. TAPS was diagnosed when an intertwin hemoglobin difference of >\u20098\u2009g/dL and reticulocyte count ratio of >\u20091.7 were observed.\nOf 162 MCDA pregnancies followed during the study period, 69 had an MCA-PSV measurement within 1 week of delivery and were included in the study. Twenty-five neonates were diagnosed with polycythemia and nine twin pairs met the criteria for TAPS. In a pooled analysis, MCA-PSV was negatively correlated with neonatal hematocrit (P = 0.017, r = -0.215) and was significantly higher in anemic fetuses than in normal controls (1.15 multiples of the median (MoM) vs 1.02 MoM, respectively; P = 0.001). However, MCA-PSV was similar among polycythemic and normal fetuses (0.95 MoM vs 1.02 MoM, respectively; P = 0.47). Intertwin difference in MCA-PSV (delta MCA-PSV) was positively correlated with intertwin hematocrit difference (P = 0.002, r = 0.394). Moreover, twin pregnancies with an intertwin hematocrit difference of >\u200924% had a significantly greater delta MCA-PSV than did those with an intertwin hematocrit difference of \u2264\u200924% (delta MCA-PSV, 19 vs 5\u2009cm/s; P < 0.001).\nMCA-PSV is not significantly decreased in polycythemic MCDA twins. However, delta MCA-PSV is associated with a large intertwin difference in hematocrit, and its use may be better than conventional methods for the risk assessment of TAPS. Copyright \u00a9 2015 ISUOG.

    "abstract": "The increase in the number of forensic genetic loci used for identification purposes results in infinitesimal random match probabilities. These probabilities are computed under assumptions made for rather simple population genetic models. Often, the forensic expert reports likelihood ratios, where the alternative hypothesis is assumed not to encompass close relatives. However, this approach implies that important factors present in real human populations are discarded. This approach may be very unfavourable to the defendant. In this paper, we discuss some important aspects concerning the closest familial relationship, i.e., identical (monozygotic) twins, when reporting the weight of evidence. This can be done even when the suspect has no knowledge of an identical twin or when official records hold no twin information about the suspect. The derived expressions are not original as several authors previously have published results accounting for close familial relationships. However, we revisit the discussion to increase the awareness among forensic genetic practitioners and include new information on medical and societal factors to assess the risk of not considering a monozygotic twin as the true perpetrator. If accounting for a monozygotic twin in the weight of evidence, it implies that the likelihood ratio is truncated at a maximal value depending on the prevalence of monozygotic twins and the societal efficiency of recognising a monozygotic twin. If a monozygotic twin is considered as an alternative proposition, then data relevant for the Danish society suggests that the threshold of likelihood ratios should approximately be between 150,000 and 2,000,000 in order to take the risk of an unrecognised identical, monozygotic twin into consideration. In other societies, the threshold of the likelihood ratio in crime cases may reach other, often lower, values depending on the recognition of monozygotic twins and the age of the suspect. In general, more strictly kept registries will imply larger thresholds on the likelihood ratio as the monozygotic twin explanation gets less probable.",

    "abstract": "A history of complex febrile seizures can increase the risk of epilepsy, but the role of genetic factors is unclear. This analysis evaluated the relationship between febrile seizures and epilepsy.\nInformation on the history of seizures was obtained by a questionnaire from twin pairs in the Mid-Atlantic, Danish, and Norwegian Twin Registries. The information was verified using medical records and detailed clinical and family interviews. The initial study evaluated the genetic epidemiology of febrile seizures in this population. Further information was analyzed and used to evaluate genetic associations of different febrile seizure subtypes.\nHistories of febrile seizures were validated in 1051 twins in 900 pairs. The febrile seizure type was classified as simple, complex, or febrile status epilepticus. There were 61% simple, 12% complex, and 7% febrile status epilepticus. There were 78 twins who developed epilepsy. The highest rate of epilepsy (22.2%) occurred in the febrile status epilepticus group. Concordance was highest in simple group.\nA twin with febrile status epilepticus is at the highest risk of developing epilepsy, but simple febrile seizures gave the highest risk for the unaffected twin to develop seizures or other neurological issues. These results are consistent with previous findings. There is a subgroup of febrile seizures that can be associated with long-term consequences. This subgroup can be associated with a significant financial and emotional burden. It is currently not possible to accurately identify which children will develop recurrent febrile seizures, epilepsy, or neuropsychological comorbidities.",

In twins, the rate of preterm birth is higher than in singletons; interventions to prevent preterm birth are needed in this high-risk population.\nWe sought to test whether a cervical pessary reduces the preterm birth rate in twin pregnancies with sonographic short cervix.\nA prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted in 5 hospitals in Spain. The ethics committees of all participating hospitals approved the protocol. The trial was registered as ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01242410. Eligible women were scanned in Spain. The primary outcome was SPB <34 weeks of gestation. Neonatal morbidity and mortality were also evaluated.\nCervical length was measured in 2287 women; 137 pregnant women with a sonographic cervical length \u226425 mm (of 154 detected with a short cervix) were randomly assigned to receive a cervical pessary or expectant management (1:1 ratio). SPB <34 weeks of gestation was significantly less frequent in the pessary group than in the expectant management group (11/68 [16.2%] vs 26/66 [39.4%]; relative risk, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.76). Pessary use was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of birthweight <2500 g (P\u00a0= .01). No significant differences were observed in composite neonatal morbidity outcome (8/136 [5.9%] vs 12/130 [9.1%]; relative risk, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-1.50) or neonatal mortality (none) between the groups. No serious adverse effects associated with the use of a cervical pessary were observed.\nThe insertion of a cervical pessary was associated with a significant reduction in the SPB rate. We propose the use of a cervical pessary for preventing preterm birth in twin pregnancies of mothers with a short cervix.",

    "abstract": "In view of criticism regarding the usefulness of heritability coefficients, the aim of this study was to analyze separately the information on genetic and environmental variability. Such an approach, based on the normalization of trait's variability for its value, is determined by the coefficients of genetic polymorphism (Pg) and ecosensitivity (De). The studied material included 1263 twin pairs of both sexes (among them 424 pairs of monozygotic twins and 839 pairs of dizygotic twins) born between the 22nd and 41st week of gestation. Variability of six somatic traits was analyzed. The zygosity of same-sex twins was determined based on the polymorphism of DNA from lymphocytes of the umbilical cord blood, obtained at birth. The coefficients of genetic polymorphism and ecosensitivity for analyzed traits of male and female twins born at various months of gestation were calculated. Our study revealed that a contribution of the genetic component predominated over that of the environmental component in determining the phenotypic variability of somatic traits of newborns from twin pregnancies. The genetically determined phenotypic variability in male twins was greater than in the females. The genetic polymorphism and ecosensitivity of somatic traits were relatively stable during the period of fetal ontogeny analyzed in this study. Only in the case of body weight, a slight increase in the genetic contribution of polygenes to the phenotypic variance could be observed with gestational age, along with a slight decrease in the influence of environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, epigenetic analyses have made important contributions to our understanding of healthy development and a wide variety of adverse conditions such as cancer and psychopathology. There is increasing evidence that DNA methylation is a mechanism by which environmental factors influence gene transcription and, ultimately, phenotype. However, differentiating the effects of the environment from those of genetics on DNA methylation profiles remains a significant challenge. Monozygotic (MZ) twin study designs are unique in their ability to control for genetic differences because each pair of MZ twins shares essentially the same genetic sequence with the exception of a small number of de novo mutations and copy number variations. Thus, differences within twin pairs in gene expression and phenotype, including behavior, can be attributed in the majority of cases to environmental effects rather than genetic influence. In this article, we review the literature showing how MZ twin designs can be used to study basic epigenetic principles, contributing to understanding the role of early in utero and postnatal environmental factors on the development of psychopathology. We also highlight the importance of initiating longitudinal and experimental studies with MZ twins during pregnancy. This approach is especially important to identify: (1) critical time periods during which the early environment can impact brain and mental health development, and (2) the specific mechanisms through which early environmental effects may be mediated. These studies may inform the optimum timing and design for early preventive interventions aimed at reducing risk for psychopathology.",

Both environmental and host genetic factors influence microbial communities in distinct anatomical niches, but little is known about their interplay in shaping the skin microbiome. Here, we investigate the heritable components of the skin microbiome and their association with host genetic factors.\nBased on our analysis of the microbiota from 45 individuals including monozygotic and dizygotic twins aged 26-55 years and their mothers, we found that skin microbial diversity was significantly influenced by age and skin pigmentation. Heritability analysis revealed genetic and shared environmental impacts on the skin microbiome. Furthermore, we observed a strong association between the abundance of Corynebacterium jeikeium and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the host FLG gene related to epidermal barrier function.\nThis study reveals an intimate association of the human skin microbiome and host genes, and increases our understanding of the role of human genetic factors in establishing a microbial ecosystem on the body surface.",

    "abstract": "Primary hip osteoarthritis, radiographic as well as symptomatic, is highly associated with increasing age in both genders. However, little is known about the mechanisms behind this, in particular if this increase is caused by genetic factors. This study examined the risk and heritability of primary osteoarthritis of the hip leading to a total hip arthroplasty, and if this heritability increased with increasing age.\nIn a nationwide population-based follow-up study 118,788 twins from the Danish Twin Register and 90,007 individuals from the Danish Hip Arthroplasty Register for the period 1995 to 2010 were examined. Our main outcomes were the cumulative incidence, proband-wise concordance and heritability on age, within-pair correlations in monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, and the genetic and environmental influence estimated in models taking into account that individuals may not have had a total hip arthroplasty at the time of follow-up.\nThere were 94,063 twins eligible for analyses, comprising 835 cases of 36 concordant and 763 discordant twin pairs. The probability increased particularly from 50 years of age. After sex and age adjustment a significant additive genetic component of 47% (12:79), a shared environmental component of 21% (2:76) and a unique environment component of 32% (21:41) accounted for the variation in population liability to total hip arthroplasty. The sex-adjusted proband-wise concordance and heritability on age indicated an increasing age-associated genetic influence onwards from 60 years of age.\nThe cumulative incidence in primary hip osteoarthritis leading to total hip arthroplasty increases in particular after the age of 50 years in both genders. Family factors of genes and shared environment are highly significant and account for 68% of the variation in the population liability to total hip arthroplasty; however, the genetic influence increases significantly from 60 years of age onwards.",

After sex and age adjustment a significant additive genetic component of 47% (12:79), a shared environmental component of 21% (2:76) and a unique environment component of 32% (21:41) accounted for the variation in population liability to total hip arthroplasty. The sex-adjusted proband-wise concordance and heritability on age indicated an increasing age-associated genetic influence onwards from 60 years of age.",

    "abstract": "Genetic or environmental influences on cerebral glucose metabolism are unknown. We attempted to reveal these influences in elderly twins by means of (18)F-FDG PET.\n(18)F-FDG uptake was studied in 40 monozygotic and 18 dizygotic volunteer twin pairs aged 30 y or over. We also created 18 control pairs by pairing age- and sex-matched genetically unrelated subjects from dizygotic and monozygotic pairs. SUV images of the brain were reconstructed and analyzed by voxel-based statistical analysis with automated region-of-interest setting. The (18)F-FDG uptake in each cerebral lobe was semiquantified by taking a ratio of SUVmean in each region of interest to whole-brain SUVaverage. We calculated an intraclass correlation coefficient of SUV ratio in each region of interest for monozygotic and dizygotic pairs. By comparing differences in coefficients between monozygotic and dizygotic pairs, genetic and environmental contributions were estimated.\nThe intraclass correlation coefficient in monozygotic pairs was significantly higher than that in dizygotic pairs in the parietal lobes bilaterally (P < 0.001) and in the left temporal lobe (P < 0.05) but was not significantly different in other lobes.\nThe present study indicated that in the right and left parietal lobes and left temporal lobe, cerebral glucose metabolism is influenced more by genetics than by environment, whereas in other brain regions the influence of environment is dominant.",

    "abstract": "Discordant growth is a common complication of monochorionic/diamniotic pregnancies; in approximately 50% of cases, the cause is unknown. The case presented here suggests that discordant growth of monozygotic twins could start during preimplantation development. Two inner cell masses (ICMs) within the same blastocyst may originate in uneven splitting of a single \"parental\" ICM, or the two ICMs may be formed independently de novo. We studied the transcriptomes of two morphologically distinct ICMs within a single blastocyst using high-resolution RNA sequencing. The data indicated that the two ICM were at different stages of development; one was in the earliest stages of lineage commitment, while the other had already differentiated into epiblast and primitive endoderm. IGF1-mediated signaling is likely to play a key role in ICM growth and to be the major driver behind these differences.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies are commonly associated with low birth weight (LBW) infants. Most studies focus on growth of LBW compared with normal infants in singleton. However, there has not been any study on twins to compare LBW with normal birth weight (NBW) infants as a match control of the same twin.\nThis cohort study was conducted at Healthcare centers of Kashan, in 2013. Twins differing in birth weight (one with LBW and the other with NBW) were assessed using the care charts in Well Care program in regard to weight, height and head circumference measurements at birth and after 6, 12, 24 months of age and were compared separately between all matched pairs and in four sex-twin subgroups which was defined according to the sex of each twin in pairs; SF (Same-sex: Female), SM (Same-sex: Male), LF (LBW: Female) and LM (LBW: Male).\nIncidence of dissimilar twins in birth weight was 28.4%. The weight of LBW was significantly lower than the NBW cohort in SF and LF subgroups up to 24 months. The height of LBW was not significantly different from NBW cohort in SM and LM subgroups up to 24 month. Head circumference was significantly higher in LBW compared to NBW cohort in LM subgroup up to 24 month. However, these indices were significantly lower in LBW compared to NBW cohort in all pairs.\nAlthough LBW cohort was significantly lower than the NBW in growth indices at birth to 2 years old in all twins, however, highly variable results was observed in four subgroups of sex-twin.",

Controlling for twin-shared factors, SIRT1, SIRT3, NAMPT, NMNAT3, and NRK1 were significantly negatively correlated with adiposity, SIRT1, SIRT5, NMNAT2, NMNAT3, and NRK1 were negatively correlated with inflammation, and SIRT1 and SIRT5 were positively correlated with insulin sensitivity. Expressions of genes involved in mitochondrial unfolded protein response were also significantly down-regulated in the heavier co-twins.\nOur data highlight a strong relationship of reduced NAD(+)/SIRT pathway expression with acquired obesity, inflammation, insulin resistance, and impaired mitochondrial protein homeostasis in SAT.",

    "abstract": "We investigated whether expression of genes previously implicated in arterial stiffening associates with cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of arterial stiffness. Women from the Twins UK cohort (n=470, aged 39-81 years) had gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines measured using an Illumina microarray. Arterial stiffness was measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and carotid distensibility. A subsample (n=121) of women had repeat vascular measures after a mean\u00b1SD follow-up of 4.3\u00b11.4 years. Associations of arterial phenotypes with gene expression levels were examined for 52 genes identified from previous association studies. The gene transcript most closely associated with pulse wave velocity in cross-sectional analysis was ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (P=0.012). Pleiotropic genetic effects accounted for 14% of the phenotypic correlation between ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase expression and pulse wave velocity. Progression of pulse wave velocity during the follow-up period best related to expression of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (\u03b2=0.19, P=0.008) and collagen type IV \u03b1 1 (\u03b2=0.32, P<0.0001). Gene transcripts most closely related to change in carotid distensibility during the follow-up period were endothelial nitric oxide synthase (\u03b2=-0.20, P=0.005), angiotensin-converting enzyme (\u03b2=-0.15, P=0.035), and B-cell CLL/lymphoma11B (\u03b2=0.18, P=0.010). Expression levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme also related to progression in carotid diameter (\u03b2=0.21, P=0.012). Expression levels of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase, involved in arterial calcification, and collagen type IV \u03b1 1, involved in collagen formation, correlate with aortic stiffening. These genes may be functional mediators of arterial stiffening.",

    "abstract": "Low birth weight (LBW) can have an impact on health outcomes in later life, especially in relation to pre-disposition to metabolic disease. Several studies suggest that LBW resulting from restricted intrauterine growth leaves a footprint on DNA methylation in utero, and this influence likely persists into adulthood. To investigate this further, we performed epigenome-wide association analyses of blood DNA methylation using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip profiles in 71 adult monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs who were extremely discordant for birth weight. A signal mapping to the IGF1R gene (cg12562232, p = 2.62 \u00d7 10(-8)), was significantly associated with birth weight discordance at a genome-wide false-discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05. We pursued replication in three additional independent datasets of birth weight discordant MZ pairs and observed the same direction of association, but the results were not significant. However, a meta-analysis across the four independent samples, in total 216 birth-weight discordant MZ twin pairs, showed a significant positive association between birth weight and DNA methylation differences at IGF1R (random-effects meta-analysis p = .04), and the effect was particularly pronounced in older twins (random-effects meta-analysis p = .008, 98 older birth-weight discordant MZ twin pairs). The results suggest that severe intra-uterine growth differences (birth weight discordance >20%) are associated with methylation changes in the IGF1R gene in adulthood, independent of genetic effects.",

    "abstract": "Mosaic trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) in monozygotic diamniotic liveborn twins is rare. We describe such a case involving preterm male infants. Although both infants had a low percentage of trisomy 18 cells in peripheral blood leucocytes, their varied phenotypic presentation of mosaic trisomy 18 resulted in one twin surviving, with the other twin's demise at 1 month of age. Despite the presence of trisomy 18 in peripheral leucocytes, further analysis of a buccal smear and skin biopsy of the surviving twin did not show evidence of trisomy 18. Establishing such diagnoses in a timely manner is imperative for the child, parents and clinicians. The clinical course of these twins reflects the unpredictable prognosis associated with the diagnosis of mosaic trisomy 18, and emphasises the challenges that can be encountered when counselling parents.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among aging Vietnam-era veterans is not well characterized.\nIn a cross-sectional study, 5,598 male Vietnam-era veterans and members of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry were assessed for PTSD using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Current symptoms were measured with the PTSD Checklist (PCL). PTSD was estimated according to age (<60 or\u00a0\u2265 60) and Vietnam theater service.\nThe lifetime prevalence of PTSD in theater veterans aged at least 60 years was 16.9% (95% CI: 13.9%-20.5%) and higher than the 5.5% (95% CI: 4.3%-7.0%) among nontheater veterans. Among veterans younger than 60 years, the comparable prevalence was 22.0% for theater (95% CI: 16.7%-28.4%) and 15.7% for nontheater (95% CI: 13.4%-18.2%) veterans. Similar results were found for theater service and current PTSD prevalence (past 12 months). PCL scores were significantly higher in theater compared with nontheater veterans in both younger and older cohorts. In both the younger and older cohorts significant differences in lifetime and current PTSD prevalence and PCL scores persisted in theater service discordant twin pairs.\nVietnam service is related to elevated PTSD prevalence and current symptom burden in aging veterans. More than 30 years after the end of the Vietnam conflict, many veterans continue to suffer from PTSD, which highlights the need for continuing outreach throughout the life course.",

    "abstract": "Viral agents are of interest as possible autoimmune triggers due to prior reported associations and widely studied molecular mechanisms of antiviral immune responses in autoimmunity. Here we examined new viral candidates for the initiation and/or promotion of systemic autoimmune diseases (SAID), as well as possible related signaling pathways shared in the pathogenesis of those disorders. RNA isolated from peripheral blood samples from 33 twins discordant for SAID and 33 matched, unrelated healthy controls was analyzed using a custom viral-human gene microarray. Paired comparisons were made among three study groups-probands with SAID, their unaffected twins, and matched, unrelated healthy controls-using statistical and molecular pathway analyses. Probands and unaffected twins differed significantly in the expression of 537 human genes, and 107 of those were associated with viral infections. These 537 differentially expressed human genes participate in overlapping networks of several canonical, biologic pathways relating to antiviral responses and inflammation. Moreover, certain viral genes were expressed at higher levels in probands compared to either unaffected twins or unrelated, healthy controls. Interestingly, viral gene expression levels in unaffected twins appeared intermediate between those of probands and the matched, unrelated healthy controls. Of the viruses with overexpressed viral genes, herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) was the only human viral pathogen identified using four distinct oligonucleotide probes corresponding to three HSV-2 genes associated with different stages of viral infection. Although the effects from immunosuppressive therapy on viral gene expression remain unclear, this exploratory study suggests a new approach to evaluate shared viral agents and antiviral immune responses that may be involved in the development of SAID.",

    "abstract": "Many observational studies have shown a protective effect of physical activity on cognitive ageing, but interventional studies have been less convincing. This may be due to short time scales of interventions, suboptimal interventional regimes or lack of lasting effect. Confounding through common genetic and developmental causes is also possible.\nWe aimed to test whether muscle fitness (measured by leg power) could predict cognitive change in a healthy older population over a 10-year time interval, how this performed alongside other predictors of cognitive ageing, and whether this effect was confounded by factors shared by twins. In addition, we investigated whether differences in leg power were predictive of differences in brain structure and function after 12 years of follow-up in identical twin pairs.\nA total of 324 healthy female twins (average age at baseline 55, range 43-73) performed the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) at two time points 10 years apart. Linear regression modelling was used to assess the relationships between baseline leg power, physical activity and subsequent cognitive change, adjusting comprehensively for baseline covariates (including heart disease, diabetes, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, lipids, diet, body habitus, smoking and alcohol habits, reading IQ, socioeconomic status and birthweight). A discordant twin approach was used to adjust for factors shared by twins. A subset of monozygotic pairs then underwent magnetic resonance imaging. The relationship between muscle fitness and brain structure and function was assessed using linear regression modelling and paired t tests.\nA striking protective relationship was found between muscle fitness (leg power) and both 10-year cognitive change [fully adjusted model standardised \u03b2-coefficient (Std\u03b2) = 0.174, p = 0.002] and subsequent total grey matter (Std\u03b2 = 0.362, p = 0.005). These effects were robust in discordant twin analyses, where within-pair difference in physical fitness was also predictive of within-pair difference in lateral ventricle size. There was a weak independent effect of self-reported physical activity.\nLeg power predicts both cognitive ageing and global brain structure, despite controlling for common genetics and early life environment shared by twins. Interventions targeted to improve leg power in the long term may help reach a universal goal of healthy cognitive ageing.",

    "abstract": "Recent observations of planar defects in boron carbide have been shown to deviate from perfect mirror symmetry and are referred to as \"asymmetric twins.\" Here, we demonstrate that these asymmetric twins are really phase boundaries that form in stoichiometric B(4)C (i.e., B(12)C(3)) but not in B(13)C(2). TEM observations and ab initio simulations have been coupled to show that these planar defects result from an interplay of stoichiometry, atomic positioning, icosahedral twinning, and structural hierarchy. The composition of icosahedra in B(4)C is B(11)C and translation of the carbon atom from a polar to equatorial site leads to a shift in bonding and a slight distortion of the lattice. No such distortion is observed in boron-rich B(13)C(2) because the icosahedra do not contain carbon. Implications for tailoring boron carbide with stoichiometry and extrapolations to other hierarchical crystalline materials are discussed.",

    "abstract": "We asked whether anxiety is associated with prospective risk of dementia, and the extent to which genetic influences mediate this association.\nNondemented twins (n = 1082) from the Swedish Adoption Twin Study of Aging completed an assessment of anxiety symptoms in 1984 and were followed for 28 years.\nBaseline anxiety score, independent of depressive symptoms, was significantly associated with incident dementia over follow-up (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-1.06). There was 48% increased risk of becoming demented for those who had experienced high anxiety at any time compared with those who had not. In co-twin analyses, the association between anxiety symptoms and dementia was greater for dizygotic (HR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.02-1.20) compared with monozygotic twins (HR = 1.06; 95% CI = 0.95-1.20), indicating genetic mediation.\nAnxiety symptoms were associated with increased risk of dementia. Genetic factors common to dementia and anxiety partially mediated this association.",

    "abstract": "We studied schizophrenia liability in a Danish population-based sample of 44 twin pairs (13 MZ, 31 DZ, SS plus OS) in order to replicate previous twin study findings using contemporary diagnostic criteria, to examine genetic liability shared between schizophrenia and other disorders, and to explore whether variance in schizophrenia liability attributable to environmental factors may have decreased with successive cohorts exposed to improvements in public health. ICD-10 diagnoses were determined by clinical interview. Although the best-fitting, most parsimonious biometric model of schizophrenia liability specified variance attributable to additive genetic and non-shared environmental factors, this model did not differ significantly from a model that also included non-additive genetic factors, consistent with recent interview-based twin studies. Schizophrenia showed strong genetic links to other psychotic disorders but much less so for the broader category of psychiatric disorders in general. We also observed a marginally significant decline in schizophrenia variance attributable to environmental factors over successive Western European cohorts, consistent perhaps with improvements in diagnosis and in prenatal and perinatal care and with a secular decline in the prevalence of schizophrenia in that region.",

    "abstract": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by a high level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. We report 4-year-old dichorionic diamniotic twins (boy and girl) with FH who presented with multiple xanthomas on the face, both knees, both feet, and buttocks. Family history revealed vertical transmission of hypercholesterolemia from father to patients, thereby suggesting dominant inheritance. Lipid data of their mother did not match the criteria of FH. However, lipid data of maternal grandmother and maternal sister matched the criteria of FH. LDL receptor gene analysis of the family revealed that their father was heterozygous for a missense mutation, L547V, their mother was heterozygous for a nonsense mutation, C675X, and patients were compound heterozygous for L547V and C675X. After 10 months of treatment with pitavastatin (2 mg/day) and ezetimibe (10 mg/day), LDL-C decreased from 595 mg/dL to 267 mg/dL in the boy and from 530 mg/dL to 182 mg/dL in the girl. These findings suggest that lipid-lowering therapy with statin may be considered in pediatric patients with compound heterozygous FH (hetero FH) before inducing LDL apheresis, and gene analysis for true diagnosis in pediatric patients with multiple xanthomas should be considered, though they appear to be hetero FH from the family history and lipid data of parents.",

    "abstract": "To determine genetic and environmental impact on mandibular morphology using lateral cephalometric analysis of twins with completed mandibular growth and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) based zygosity determination.\nThe 39 cephalometric variables of 141 same gender adult pair of twins were analysed. Zygosity was determined using 15 specific DNA markers and cervical vertebral maturation method was used to assess completion of the mandibular growth. A genetic analysis was performed using maximum likelihood genetic structural equation modelling (GSEM).\nThe genetic heritability estimates of angular variables describing horizontal mandibular position in relationship to cranial base and maxilla were considerably higher than in those describing vertical position. The mandibular skeletal cephalometric variables also showed high heritability estimates with angular measurements being considerably higher than linear ones. Results of this study indicate that the angular measurements representing mandibular skeletal morphology (mandibular form) have greater genetic determination than the linear measurements (mandibular size).\nThe shape and sagittal position of the mandible is under stronger genetic control, than is its size and vertical relationship to cranial base.",

    "abstract": "Identification of individuals within pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins remains unresolved using common forensic DNA typing technology. For some criminal cases involving MZ twins as suspects, the twins had to be released due to inability to identify which of the pair was the perpetrator. In this study, we performed a genome-wide scan on whole blood-derived DNA from four pairs of healthy phenotypically concordant MZ twins using the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing technology to identify candidate DNA methylation markers with capacity to distinguish MZ twins within a pair. We identified 38 differential methylation regions showing within-pair methylation differences in all four MZ pairs. These are all located in CpG islands, 17 of which are promoter-associated, 17 are intergenic islands, and four are intragenic islands. Genes associated with these markers are related with cell proliferation, differentiation, and growth and development, including zinc finger proteins, PRRX2, RBBP9, or are involved in G-protein signaling, such as the regulator of G-protein signaling 16. Further validation studies on additional MZ twins are now required to evaluate the broader utility of these 38 markers for forensic use.",

    "abstract": "Introduction\u2003This report will discuss a case of minimally conjoined omphalopagus twins (MCOTs) with a body stalk anomaly (BSA). Case Report\u2003We experienced monochorionic diamniotic (MD) twins born at 31 weeks. One infant was suspicious of BSA before birth, and another infant was normal. But normal infant had anal atresia with small intestine which was inserted behind the umbilicus. Twins had very short common umbilicus and infant with BSA had intestinal conjunction, two appendixes at the site of the colon, and a blind-ending colon. We diagnosed MCOTs. Discussion\u2003On the basis of the Spencer hypothesis, the etiology of MCOTs was that MD twins shared a yolk sac. However, this could not explain the presence of a BSA. It is necessary to consider the possible reasons for a singleton BSA. In addition, intestinal fusion occurred unequally in this case, although two appendixes were found in the same place, which might have occurred because of the balanced fusion.",

    "abstract": "The heritability of coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden, coronary geometry, and phenotypes associated with increased cardiometabolic risk are largely unknown. The primary aim of the Burden of Atherosclerotic Plaques Study in Twins-Genetic Loci and the Burden of Atherosclerotic Lesions (BUDAPEST-GLOBAL) study is to evaluate the influence of genetic and environmental factors on the burden of coronary artery disease. By design this is a prospective, single-center, classical twin study. In total, 202 twins (61 monozygotic pairs, 40 dizygotic same-sex pairs) were enrolled from the Hungarian Twin Registry database. All twins underwent non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) for the detection and quantification of coronary artery calcium and for the measurement of epicardial fat volumes. In addition, a single non-contrast-enhanced image slice was acquired at the level of L3-L4 to assess abdominal fat distribution. Coronary CT angiography was used for the detection and quantification of plaque, stenosis, and overall coronary artery disease burden. For the primary analysis, we will assess the presence and volume of atherosclerotic plaques. Furthermore, the 3-dimensional coronary geometry will be assessed based on the coronary CT angiography datasets. Additional phenotypic analyses will include per-patient epicardial and abdominal fat quantity measurements. Measurements obtained from monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs will be compared to evaluate the genetic or environmental effects of the given phenotype. The BUDAPEST-GLOBAL study provides a unique framework to shed some light on the genetic and environmental influences of cardiometabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Age and peripheral microcirculation disorders are the main causes of rotator cuff degeneration. Acromion variants may affect subacromial space width, causing a pathological narrowing of the space that may compromise the cuff integrity. However, it is not clear if the subacromial space width is genetically determined or if it changes according to loading conditions. To clarify this unresolved question, we performed an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) study with the aim of evaluating the acromiohumeral distance in a group of elderly monozygotic and dizygotic twins, and we analyzed the obtained data using the twin design to separate the contributions of shared and unique environments.\nWe identified twenty-nine pairs of elderly twins. On MRI scans, we evaluated the acromiohumeral distance and health status of the rotator cuff tendons. Heritability, defined as the proportion of total variance of a specific characteristic in a particular population due to a genetic cause, was estimated as twice the difference between the intraclass correlation coefficients for monozygotic and dizygotic pairs. The influence of shared environment, due to environmental factors that contribute to twin and sibling similarity, was calculated as the difference between the monozygotic correlation coefficient and the heritability index. One-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) was used to estimate the differences among job categories, both in the total cohort and within zygosity groups.\nThe intraclass correlation coefficient was substantially higher for monozygotic than for dizygotic twins, indicating a high degree of concordance of the acromiohumeral distance in pairs of individuals who shared 100% of their genes. The heritability index was 0.82, and shared and unique environmental contributions were both 0.09. There were no significant differences among subjects in different job categories, either in the total cohort (p = 0.685) or within the monozygotic (p = 0.719) and dizygotic groups (p = 0.957).\nThe acromiohumeral distance is mainly genetically determined and only marginally influenced by external factors.",

    "abstract": "Our aims were to study the effect of birthweight growth discordance (\u226520%) on neuro-developmental outcome of monochorionic and dichorionic twins and to compare the relative effects of foetal growth discordance and prematurity on cognitive outcome. We performed a cross-sectional multicentre prospective follow-up study from a cohort of 948 twin pregnancies. One hundred nineteen birthweight-discordant twin pairs were examined (24 monochorionic pairs) and were matched for gestational age at delivery with 111 concordant control pairs. Participants were assessed with the Bayley Scales between 24 and 42 months of age. Analysis was by paired t test for intra-twin pair differences and by multiple linear regression. Compared to the larger twin of a discordant pair, the smaller twin performed significantly worse in cognition (mean composite cognitive score difference\u2009=\u2009-1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20090.3-3.1, p\u2009=\u20090.01) and also in language and motor skills. Prematurity prior to 33 weeks' gestation, however, had a far greater impact on cognitive outcomes (mean cognitive composite score difference\u2009=\u2009-5.8, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.2-10.5, p\u2009=\u20090.008).\nBirthweight growth discordance of \u226520% confers an independent adverse effect on long-term neuro-development of the smaller twin. However, prior to 33 weeks' gestation, gestational age at birth adversely affects cognitive development to a greater extent than foetal growth discordance.",

    "abstract": "Childhood psychotic symptoms are associated with increased rates of schizophrenia, other psychiatric disorders, and suicide attempts in adulthood; thus, elucidating early risk indicators is crucial to target prevention efforts. There is considerable discordance for psychotic symptoms between monozygotic twins, indicating that child-specific non-genetic factors must be involved. Epigenetic processes may constitute one of these factors and have not yet been investigated in relation to childhood psychotic symptoms. Therefore, this study explored whether differences in DNA methylation at age 10 were associated with monozygotic twin discordance for psychotic symptoms at age 12. The Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study cohort of 2,232 children (1,116 twin pairs) was assessed for age-12 psychotic symptoms and 24 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for symptoms were identified for methylomic comparison. Children provided buccal samples at ages 5 and 10. DNA was bisulfite modified and DNA methylation was quantified using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 array. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with psychotic symptoms were subsequently tested in post-mortem prefrontal cortex tissue from adult schizophrenia patients and age-matched controls. Site-specific DNA methylation differences were observed at age 10 between monozygotic twins discordant for age-12 psychotic symptoms. Similar DMPs were not found at age 5. The top-ranked psychosis-associated DMP (cg23933044), located in the promoter of the C5ORF42 gene, was also hypomethylated in post-mortem prefrontal cortex brain tissue from schizophrenia patients compared to unaffected controls. These data tentatively suggest that epigenetic variation in peripheral tissue is associated with childhood psychotic symptoms and may indicate susceptibility to schizophrenia and other mental health problems.",

    "abstract": "The study of twin behavior offers the opportunity to study differential patterns of social and communicative interactions in a context where the adult partner and same-age peer are equally familiar. We investigated the development of social engagement, communicative gestures, and imitation in 7- to 25-month-old twins. Twin dyads (N=20 pairs) participated in 10-min, semi-structured play sessions, with the mother seated in a chair completing paperwork for half the session, and on the floor with her children for the other half. Overall, twins engaged more with their mothers than with their siblings: they showed objects and imitated speech and object use more frequently when interacting with their mothers than with their siblings. When the mother was otherwise engaged, the twins played with toys separately, observed each other's toy play, or were unengaged. These results demonstrate that adult scaffolding of social interactions supports increased communicative bids even in a context where both familiar peers and adults are available as communicative partners.",

    "abstract": "Alagille syndrome is a multisystem developmental disorder characterized by bile duct paucity, congenital heart disease, vertebral anomalies, posterior embryotoxon, and characteristic facial features. Alagille syndrome is typically the result of germline mutations in JAG1 or NOTCH2 and is one of several human diseases caused by Notch signaling abnormalities. A wide phenotypic spectrum has been well documented in Alagille syndrome. Therefore, monozygotic twins with Alagille syndrome provide a unique opportunity to evaluate potential phenotypic modifiers such as environmental factors or stochastic effects of gene expression. In this report, we describe an Alagille syndrome monozygotic twin pair with discordant placental and clinical findings. We propose that environmental factors such as prenatal hypoxia may have played a role in determining the phenotypic severity.",

We have described how the U.S. Neonatal Resuscitation Program algorithm can be modified for delivery room resuscitation of omphaloischiopagus conjoined twins. In planning for the delivery and resuscitation of these patients, we considered the challenges of providing cardiopulmonary support to preterm conjoined twins in face-to-face orientation and with shared circulation via a fused liver and single umbilical cord. We also demonstrate how in situ simulation can be used to prepare a large, multidisciplinary team of health care professionals to deliver safe, efficient, and effective care to such patients.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period may imply morbidity leading to work incapacity; however, this is seldom studied. This study aimed to compare twin sisters giving or not giving birth regarding occurrence of sickness absence (SA) and disability pension (DP).\nThis population-based cohort study included all 6323 female twins born in Sweden 1959-1990, using register data for 1994-2010 about SA and DP. Average number of SA/DP days/year was calculated in relation to the year of the first delivery, or, if not giving birth, the year when the twin sister gave birth. Twin pairs discordant for delivery were used to investigate the importance of genetic and environmental factors for occurrence of SA and DP.\nIn all, 52% had a first delivery during 1994-2010. Except for the year of delivery, the average number of SA days/year was similar when comparing women who gave birth to those who did not, while number of DP days was significantly higher in women who did not give birth. Differences between the groups seem attributable to genetic factors. Women who delivered once had higher levels of SA and DP than those who had several deliveries. DP with mental diagnoses was more common among women who had not delivered whereas DP with musculoskeletal diagnoses occurred more often among women who delivered.\nLevels of SA were similar among women who gave birth and who did not. Women not giving birth had significantly higher levels of DP, indicating health selections into childbirth.",

    "abstract": "Birthweight remains one of the strongest predictors of perinatal mortality and disability. Birthweight percentiles form a reference that allows the detection of neonates at higher risk of neonatal and postneonatal morbidity. The aim of the study is to present updated national birthweight percentiles by gestational age for male and female twins born in Australia.\nPopulation data were extracted from the Australian National Perinatal Data Collection for twins born in Australia between 2001 and 2010. A total of 43,833 women gave birth to 87,666 twins in Australia which were included in the study analysis. Implausible birthweights were excluded using Tukey's methodology based on the interquartile range. Univariate analysis was used to examine the birthweight percentiles for liveborn twins born between 20 and 42 weeks gestation.\nBirthweight percentiles by gestational age were calculated for 85,925 live births (43,153 males and 42,706 females). Of these infants, 53.6% were born preterm (birth before 37 completed weeks of gestation) while 50.2% were low birthweight (<2500 g) and 8.7% were very low birthweight (<1500 g). The mean birthweight decreased from 2462 g in 2001 to 2440 g in 2010 for male twins, compared with 2485 g in 1991-94. For female twins, the mean birthweight decreased from 2375 g in 2001 to 2338 g in 2010, compared with 2382 g in 1991-94.\nThe birthweight percentiles provide clinicians and researchers with up-to-date population norms of birthweight percentiles for twins in Australia.",

    "abstract": "Silica (SiO2) is one of the most common materials on Earth. The crystalline form \u03b1-quartz is the stable silica polymorph at ambient conditions although metastable forms exist. \u03b1-quartz is a piezoelectric material, it can be produced artificially and is widely used for example in electronics and the biosciences. Despite the many application areas, the atomic surface structures of silica polymorphs are neither well understood nor well characterized. Here we present measurements of \u03b1-quartz (0001). Helium Atom Scattering combined with Atomic Force Microscopy reveals a giant reconstruction consisting of 5.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\u2009nm wide ribbons, oriented 10.4\u00b0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u00b0 relative to the bulk unit cell. The ribbons, with the aid of atomistic modelling, can be explained as a self-organised pattern of nano Dauphine twins (nano electrical twins).",

    "abstract": "To report the outcomes of 38 monoamniotic twin pregnancies managed homogeneously to assess whether continuing the pregnancy past 32 weeks of gestation and vaginal delivery are reasonable options.\nSingle-centre retrospective study including all monoamniotic pregnancies managed over a 20-year period at Port-Royal Obstetrics Department, Paris, France.\nIn the study department, both continuation of the pregnancy up to 36 weeks of gestation and vaginal delivery are allowed for monoamniotic pregnancies in some conditions. Perinatal outcomes are described and then compared according to mode of delivery for patients who gave birth at or after 32 weeks of gestation.\nThree of the 38 pregnancies included fetal malformations; in two of these cases, both fetuses died in utero at 26 weeks of gestation. In cases without malformations, one twin died in utero in two women at 28.0 and 29.2 weeks of gestation, and both fetuses died in two other women at 24.0 and 24.5 weeks of gestation. Mean gestational age at delivery was 32.9 weeks (range 24.0-36.3). Five women gave birth between 22 and 26 weeks of gestation, six women gave birth between 27 and 31 weeks of gestation, and 27 women gave birth at or after 32 weeks of gestation (26 after excluding those with fetal malformations). No intrauterine or neonatal deaths were observed at or after 32 weeks of gestation. The 28 infants delivered vaginally did not differ significantly from the 22 infants born by caesarean section in terms of umbilical artery pH or 5-min Apgar scores.\nContinuation of monoamniotic pregnancies beyond 32 weeks of gestation and trial of vaginal delivery are both reasonable options if the parents agree, and optimal surveillance is provided.",

    "abstract": "An equine embryo produced by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was trans-cervically transferred to a recipient mare and pregnancy was confirmed via ultrasound examination on days 11, 12 and 15. On days 20 and 22, a single embryonic proper with a heartbeat was observed. On day 29, two embryos proper appeared during ultrasound examination, each possessing a heartbeat. Subsequent examinations on days 35 and 39 revealed continued viability and development of both embryos proper. On day 49, demise of both fetuses was present. Although no DNA analysis or post-partum examinations were performed, it is presumed that the fetuses were monozygotic twins based on membrane classification by ultrasound imaging as well as development occurring after the transfer of a single in vitro-produced embryo.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to verify the influence of a genetic factor on the etiology of oral bony outgrowths and to determine the prevalence and type of oral bony outgrowths (tori and exostoses) among a group of Lithuanian twins.\nIn total, 162 twins (81 twin pairs) were analyzed for the presence or absence, type, and size of oral bony outgrowths. Statistical analysis was carried out to find the prevalence of bony protuberances and the relationship between zygosity and occurrence of oral bony enlargements. Zygosity of twins was confirmed by DNA analysis.\n59.9% of the subjects had oral bony outgrowths. Mandibular tori were found in 56.8% and palatal tori in 1.8% of the sample. Palatal exostoses and mandibular exostoses were present in 1.8% and 3.1% of the sample, respectively, whereas maxillary exostoses were not found. A higher percentage of tori and exostoses were found in the group of older subjects (>18 years old, p=0.025). No significant difference was found between men and women in the prevalence of bony outgrowths. High \u03ba and r values (0.91\u00b10.062) showed very good concordance of oral bony outgrowths between monozygotic and moderate concordance (0.58\u00b10.141) between dizygotic co-twins (p<0.001). The calculation of heritability estimate verifies dominant influence of genetic factor on the etiology of oral bony outgrowths (h(2)=0.658).\nThe most common bony outgrowth was torus mandibularis. Our results show that the genetic factor is dominant in the etiology of oral bony outgrowths.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To explore the mechanism and diagnostic method for monochorionic-diamniotic twins discordant for karyotype analysis. METHODS Dual amniocentesis was performed on five pairs of monochorionic-diamniotic twins, which all consisted of a normal twin and one with multiple malformations revealed by ultrasound. Karyotype analysis was performed on amniocytes derived from each of the twins. Zygosity was also determined with DNA extracted from amniocytes with 16 polymorphic microsatellite markers. RESULTS Three cases of 45,X, one case of 47,XX,+9 and one case of 47,XY,+18 were detected among the abnormal twins, while the normal fetuses all had a normal karyotype. DNA analysis suggested that, in all cases, the twins have shared the 16 polymorphic microsatellite markers, which confirmed their monozygosity. CONCLUSION Monochorionic-diamniotic twins may be discordant for karyotyping, for which anaphase lagging, chromosomal non-disjunction and trisomy rescue may be the underlying reasons. As a simple method, dual amniocentesis can be used to obtain amniotic fluid samples for karyotype analysis and determination of zygosity for such twins.",

    "abstract": "One important task in translational cancer research is the search for new prognostic biomarkers to improve survival prognosis for patients. The use of high-throughput technologies allows simultaneous measurement of genome-wide gene expression or other genomic data for all patients in a clinical trial. Penalized likelihood methods such as lasso regression can be applied to such high-dimensional data, where the number of (genomic) covariables is usually much larger than the sample size. There is a connection between the lasso and the Bayesian regression model with independent Laplace priors on the regression parameters, and understanding this connection has been useful for understanding the properties of lasso estimates in linear models (e.g. Park and Casella, 2008). In this paper, we study the lasso in the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks in the context of Cox models. For the Bayesian lasso we extend the approach by Lee et al. (2011). In particular, we impose the lasso penalty only on the genome features, but not on relevant clinical covariates, to allow the mandatory inclusion of important established factors. We investigate the models in high- and low-dimensional simulation settings and in an application to chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",

    "abstract": "The unique intrauterine environment has been proposed to put twins at increased risk of certain cancers compared to singletons, still large population comparisons have generally indicated lower risks in twins. To improve the understanding of potential twin influence on cancer we compared twins to their singletons siblings, to target a unique twinning influence. Singletons from twin families were contrasted to singletons from non-twin families to further capture potential twin family influence on risk of cancer. Family relations were identified using the Swedish Multi-Generation Register. Among individuals born between 1932 and 1958, 49,156 twins and N\u2009=\u200935,227 singletons were identified from 18,098 unique twin families. All incident cases of specific cancer types were identified in the National Cancer Register up to the end of 2007. Standardized survival functions were estimated using weighted Cox proportional hazard regression and the corresponding cumulative risks plotted against age. Overall, primary cancers were identified in 9% and 18% of all male and female twins, compared to 11% and 19% of their male and female singleton siblings. When specific cancer sites were compared using standardized cumulative risk plots, no consistent statistically significant differences were noted either between twins and singletons of twin families or between singletons of twin and non-twin families. Despite a different intrauterine experience, twinning does not seem to have any greater negative influence on life-time risks of cancer. The findings also indicate that twin family membership has no substantial influence on cancer risks.",

Genetic analysis of these networks may help identify processes giving rise to heritable brain disorders, but we do not yet know which network measures are promising for genetic analyses. Many factors affect the downstream results, such as the tractography algorithm used to define structural connectivity. We tested nine different tractography algorithms and four normalization methods to compute brain networks for 853 young healthy adults (twins and their siblings). We fitted genetic structural equation models to all nine network measures, after a normalization step to increase network consistency across tractography algorithms. Probabilistic tractography algorithms with global optimization (such as Probtrackx and Hough) yielded higher heritability statistics than \"greedy\" algorithms (such as FACT) which process small neighborhoods at each step. Some global network measures (probtrackx-derived GLOB and ST) showed significant genetic effects, making them attractive targets for genome-wide association studies.",

Information on chorionicity was obtained from the Northern Survey of Twins and Multiple Pregnancy. Prevalence was calculated as the number of cases occurring in live births, late miscarriages (20-23 weeks), stillbirths (\u226524\u2005weeks) and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly, per 10\u2005000 total births. The risk of CHD in twins compared with singletons was estimated using Poisson regression.\nThere were 399\u2005414 singleton births of which 2984 (0.7%) had CHD. Among 11\u2005871 twin births, 154 (1.3%) had CHD; one twin was affected by CHD in 2.5% of twin pregnancies. Of 8605 dichorionic (DC) births and 2317 monochorionic (MC) births, 96 (1.1%) and 47 (2.0%) were associated with CHD. Compared with singletons, twins were at significantly increased risk of CHD (RR=1.73, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.04; p<0.001). MC twins were at 82% significantly increased risk of CHD compared with DC twins (RR=1.82, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.57; p<0.001).

    "abstract": "There are three types of monozygotic (MZ) twins. MZ twins can either share one chorion and one amnion, each twin can have its own amnion, or MZ twins can-like dizygotic twins-each have their own chorion and amnion. Sharing the same chorion may create a more similar/dissimilar prenatal environment and bias heritability estimates, but most twin studies do not distinguish between these three types of MZ twin pairs. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of chorion sharing on the similarity within MZ twin pairs for a large number of traits. Information on chorion status was obtained for the Netherlands twin register (NTR) by linkage to the records from the database of the dutch pathological anatomy national automated archive (PALGA). Record linkage was successful for over 9000 pairs. Effect of chorion type was tested by comparing the within-pair similarity between monochorionic (MC) and dichorionic (DC) MZ twins on 66 traits including weight, height, motor milestones, child problem behaviors, cognitive function, wellbeing and personality. For only 10 traits, within-pair similarity differed between MCMZ and DCMZ pairs. For traits influenced by birth weight (e.g. weight and height in young children) we expected that MC twins would be more discordant. This was found for 5 out of 13 measures. When looking at traits where blood supply is important, we saw MCMZ twins to be more concordant than DCMZ's for 3 traits. We conclude that the influence on the MZ twin correlation of the intra-uterine prenatal environment, as measured by sharing a chorion type, is small and limited to a few phenotypes. This implies that the assumption of equal prenatal environment of mono- and DC MZ twins, which characterizes the classical twin design, is largely tenable.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the degree of mixed-handedness in predominantly right-handed Vietnam combat veteran twins and their identical, combat-unexposed cotwins. The \"high-risk\" cotwins of combat veterans with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) had more mixed-handedness (i.e., less right-handedness) than the \"low-risk\" cotwins of combat veterans without PTSD. Self-reported combat exposure in combat-exposed twins was a mediator of the association between handedness in their unexposed cotwins and PTSD in the twins themselves. We conclude that mixed-handedness is a familial risk factor for combat-related PTSD. This risk may be mediated in part by a proclivity for mixed-handed soldiers and Marines to experience heavier combat.",

    "abstract": "Homeopathy claims a curative reaction from small doses of a substance, high doses of which cause symptoms similar to those the patient is suffering from. Hormesis is a concept of biphasic dose-response to different pharmacological and toxicological agents. According to this concept, a small dose of a noxious agent can exert a beneficial action. A hypothesis is defended here that hormesis as a general principle can be assumed only for the factors present in the natural environment thus having induced adaptation of living organisms. Generalizations of the hormesis phenomenon used in support of homeopathy are unfounded. Low-dose impacts may be associated with a higher risk in a state of organ sub-compensation or failure especially in the elderly patients. Practical recommendations should be based neither on the hormesis as a default approach nor on the postulates of homeopathy. All clinically relevant effects, hormetic or not, should be tested by the methods of evidence-based medicine.",

    "abstract": "Healthy first-degree relatives of patients with affective disorders are at increased risk for affective disorders and express discrete structural and functional abnormalities in the brain reward system. However, value-based decision making is not well understood in these at-risk individuals.\nWe investigated healthy monozygotic and dizygotic twins with or without a co-twin history of affective disorders (high-risk and low-risk groups, respectively) using functional MRI during a gambling task. We assessed group differences in activity related to gambling risk over the entire brain.\nWe included 30 monozygotic and 37 dizygotic twins in our analysis. Neural activity in the anterior insula and ventral striatum increased linearly with the amount of gambling risk in the entire cohort. Individual neuroticism scores were positively correlated with the neural response in the ventral striatum to increasing gambling risk and negatively correlated with individual risk-taking behaviour. Compared with low-risk twins, the high-risk twins showed a bilateral reduction of risk-related activity in the middle insula extending into the temporal cortex with increasing gambling risk. Post hoc analyses revealed that this effect was strongest in dizygotic twins.\nThe relatively old average age of the mono- and dizygotic twin cohort (49.2 yr) may indicate an increased resilience to affective disorders. The size of the monozygotic high-risk group was relatively small (n = 13).\nThe reduced processing of risk magnitude in the middle insula may indicate a deficient integration of exteroceptive information related to risk-related cues with interoceptive states in individuals at familial risk for affective disorders. Impaired risk processing might contribute to increased vulnerability to affective disorders.",

    "abstract": "In dealing with conjoined twins, we have adopted a pragmatic approach in balancing what is possible, parental wishes and the likely outcome for the children. We believe that separation where feasible should be undertaken but appreciate that a few parents may wish their children to remain joined. The advice that we give balances the very real risks of surgery against the type of life the twins will experience if they remain joined. In some types of union such as end to end ischiopagus, the twins will never stand and will be bedridden. With other types of union, independent walking is not possible. Such limitations on living seem intolerable to us, but we have left the final decision to parents.",

    "abstract": "Craniopagus twins are rare and account for up to 6% of all conjoined twins. No hospital will encounter many such twins and the opportunity to develop expertise is limited. We have dealt with 2 such sets and illustrate our approach by reference to our most recent set. We believe that detailed imaging allows precise delineation of the anatomy and facilitates detailed planning of the surgery. When venous drainage from the 2 brains is connected, we believe that staged separation is preferable as gradual alteration of hemodynamics may be safer than a single-stage procedure.",

    "abstract": "Structural cardiac defects occur in at least 1 twin in about 75% of conjoined twins with thoracic level fusion. Outcomes after surgical separation of thoracic level conjoined twins have been favorable when the hearts have been separate. However, even in this situation, the outlook is poor for an individual twin with an important cardiac defect. Arterial anastomosis between twin circulations is an important additional consideration, with poor outcomes for perfusion recipient twins. Surgical separation is contraindicated when ventricular level cardiac fusion exists. Cardiac assessment is a key component of prenatal counseling.",

    "abstract": "Imaging plays a key role in the management of conjoined twins. Pre-operative multi-modality studies are vital to assess operability and to aid surgical planning. Technical advances in imaging such as high-resolution isovolumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and three-dimensional modeling now result in extremely accurate anatomical information. Varied information from a comprehensive radiological work-up enables the surgeons to plan the safest possible operative procedure, helps the anesthetic team before and during surgery, and guides the intensive care team in the post-operative phase. This article will review the radiological techniques used in our institution, highlighting potential pitfalls with the various imaging modalities.",

    "abstract": "We set to investigate the possible role of genes and environment in developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for AD.\nThree pairs of twins discordant for AD, who were enrolled in the Finnish Twin Cohort, were used in the study and compared with 13 controls. Gray matter changes were assessed with magnetic resonance images using voxel-based morphometry with statistical parametric mapping.\nIn the affected twins, the peaks of volume loss were located bilaterally in the temporal (including the hippocampus), the frontal, and the parietal lobes, while in the unaffected siblings, the peaks were located in the frontal gyri and in the parietal lobule. Thus, in the unaffected twins, the pattern of volume loss overlaps with the neocortical but not with the medial temporal areas.\nThese findings suggest that genetic factors more largely control neocortical regions, whereas environmental factors more strongly affect medial temporal regions.",

    "abstract": "Vasa previa is a condition in which one or more fetal blood vessels run through the amniotic membranes and cross or run near the external orifice of the uterus. Rupture of membranes can lead to tearing of these vessels and cause acute fetal exsanguination. In monochorionic twin (MC) pregnancies, acute exsanguination in one twin can lead to severe complications in the co-twin due to the presence of inter-twin placental vascular connections. We report a MC pair with severe perinatal asphyxia due to acute exsanguination after prenatally undetected ruptured vasa previa. This resulted in severe hemorrhagic shock in both twins with double fatal outcome. Antenatal detection of vasa previa is of paramount importance to prevent severe morbidity and mortality, especially in MCs. A review of the literature is presented.",

    "abstract": "Twins living in different countries offer opportunities to explore associations between observed differences and experiential effects. This report compared the life histories, cognitive abilities, personality traits, psychomotor skills, medical characteristics, job satisfaction, social support and social relations of dizygotic (DZ) female twins reunited at 78, the world's longest separated set. The twins' advanced age also enabled a study of how co-twin differences in aging may be associated with current behavioral and social differences. Consistent with previous studies, these dizygotic reared apart (DZA) twins showed discordance across some, but not all, traits. Their different rearing situations and life histories may explain current differences in their responses to meeting their twin. This case highlights the importance of both genetic and rearing factors on behavior, but does not allow firm conclusions regarding the extent to which these sources explain individual developmental differences. However, such data contribute to the growing number of cross-culturally separated twins, generating novel hypotheses that may be assessed using larger samples.",

    "abstract": "Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonates (birth weight <10th centile) are at higher risk of altered glucose homeostasis compared to appropriate for gestational age (AGA) neonates. The aim of this matched case-control study was to estimate the incidence of hypoglycaemia and/or hyperglycaemia in monochorionic (MC) twins with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR).\nWe included all MC twins with sIUGR (2002-2013). Neonates in the SGA group were matched with their AGA co-twin. We recorded the occurrence of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia in the first 48\u2009h after birth and studied the association with SGA.\nIn this retrospective study were 126 twin pairs included. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the SGA group and AGA group was 29.6% and 17.4%, respectively, hyperglycaemia occurred in 8.7% of the SGA neonates and in 2.6% of the AGA co-twins. Multivariate analysis showed an independent association of SGA with hypoglycaemia (OR 1.97, CI 1.23-3.18, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01), but not with hyperglycaemia (OR 2.57, CI 1.64-10.28, p\u2009=\u20090.182). Low gestational age (GA) at birth (OR 1.65, CI 1.09-2.48, p\u2009=\u20090.02) showed an independent association with hyperglycaemia.\nThe risk of hypoglycaemia is almost twofold higher in SGA neonates compared to their MC AGA twins. Low GA appeared to be an independent risk factor for hyperglycaemia in SGA neonates.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality primarily due to spontaneous preterm deliveries. The mean gestational age for delivery is 35.3 weeks and twins account for 23% of preterm births <32 weeks. A number of strategies have been proposed to prevent preterm deliveries: tocolytics, bed rest, hospitalization, home uterine activity monitoring, cerclage, and most recently, progesterone. Unfortunately, none have proven effective. Recent metaanalyses and reviews suggest that transvaginal cervical length (TVCL) ultrasound in the second trimester is a powerful predictor of preterm birth among asymptomatic women. Indeed, TVCL has the highest positive and negative predictive values for determining the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery in twin pregnancies. It follows that TVCL assessment may allow identification of a subset of twin pregnancies that re better candidates for interventions intended to prevent prematurity.\nWe sought to determine whether use of TVCL prolongs gestation in twin pregnancies.\nThis is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of 125 dichorionic or monochorionic/diamniotic twin pregnancies without prior preterm birth <28 weeks. The study group (n = 63) had TVCL and digital exams monthly from 16-28 weeks and were managed with a standard algorithm for activity restriction and cerclage. The control group (n = 62) had monthly digital cervical examinations but no routine TVCL ultrasound examinations. The primary outcome was gestational age at delivery. Secondary outcomes included percentage of deliveries <35 weeks, and maternal and neonatal outcomes.\nThe mean gestational age at delivery was 35.7 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 35.2-36.2) among those managed with TVCL and 35.5 weeks (95% CI, 34.7-36.4) among the control patients. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of deliveries <38 weeks were not significantly different between groups. This was true whether we compared curves with a log-rank test (P = .67), Breslow test (P = .67), or Tarone-Ware test (P = .64). The percentage of deliveries <35 0/7 weeks did not differ: 27.4% for subjects managed with routine TVCL and 28.6% for control subjects (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.60-1.54). Our study had an 80% power to detect a 12-day difference in the gestational age at delivery with 95% confidence.\nThe overall mean length of gestation and the percentage of women delivering <35 weeks did not differ between twin gestations managed with TVCL and digital exams monthly from 16-28 weeks with a standard algorithm for activity restriction and cerclage and controls who had monthly digital cervical examinations but no routine TVCL. Routine second-trimester transvaginal ultrasound assessment of cervical length is not associated with improved outcomes when incorporated into the standard management of otherwise low-risk twin pregnancies.",

Estrogens, androgens, sex hormone-binding globulin, progesterone, and gonadotropins were measured.\nHormonal profiles were compared between singletons and twins, different types of twins, and opposite-sex and same-sex twins.\nEstrogen and progesterone concentrations were higher in mothers of twins compared with singletons, but twin babies had lower estrogen and progesterone concentrations at birth. Opposite-sex twin girls did not have higher androgens in cord blood compared with same-sex twin girls. Boys of an opposite-sex twin had lower luteinizing hormone concentrations compared with dizygotic twin boys with a brother as a co-twin.\nChildren from a twin are not overexposed to sex steroids at the time of birth, despite higher concentrations in their mothers, and girls from opposite sex twins do not show androgenic influences from their male co-twin. The female co-twin may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis of her brother via central inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Although specialised clinics for multiple pregnancies are recommended by several Obstetrics and Gynaecology governing bodies, studies examining outcome before and after introduction of such clinics remain few, were performed predominantly in North America in the 1990s, and either amongst dichorionic twin pregnancies only or where chorionicity was not specified. Our objective, in the modern setting with twins of known chorionicity, was to compare maternal and neonatal outcomes of twin pregnancies before and after commencement of a consultant-led, multidisciplinary twins clinic (TC).\nRetrospective cohort study of 513 women, with birth of twins at \u226520 weeks' gestation, January 2007 to November 2011, at a metropolitan tertiary maternity hospital, Sydney, Australia. Demographic, pregnancy, and outcome data were obtained from hospital databases. Women receiving TC care (2009-2011) were compared to those receiving general antenatal clinic (ANC) care (2007-2010) and private care (2009-2011). Other models of care were excluded. Main outcome measures were total maternal inpatient stay, mode of birth, gestational age at birth, and neonatal nursery admission.\n286 women were included in the main analyses: 84 attended ANC, 101 TC, and 101 a private obstetrician. TC women had similar demographics to ANC women and were slightly younger than private patients. TC women had lower Caesarean section rates (55% vs. 70% ANC and 76% private, p\u2009=\u20090.008) and fewer late preterm (34\u2009+\u20090-36\u2009+\u20096 weeks) births, (26%TC vs. 44% ANC and 41% private, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Median maternal inpatient stay was shorter in TC than ANC (7 vs. 8 days, p\u2009=\u20090.009) and similar to private (7 days). Nursery admission rates were higher in private patients (67% vs. 49% ANC and 47% TC, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and average birthweight lower (2283 g vs. 2501 g ANC and 2496 g TC, p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nWithin a single centre, maternal and neonatal twin pregnancy outcomes varied significantly by model of care. Introducing a specialised twins clinic in our setting decreased Caesarean section rates, late preterm birth, and inpatient stay compared to ANC.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies generally represent a high-risk pregnancy. However, monozygous twins are real challenges for obstetricians due to the complications that may occur. Among the particular cases of monozygous twins in the University Emergency Hospital of Bucharest, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, a monochorial monoamniotic pregnancy with conjoined twins has been described. These particular medical circumstances require a deeper understanding of the vascular anatomical particularities. An accurate diagnosis implies a most detailed description of the morphological dynamics of the fetuses with the study of the impact of the vascular anomaly on their development so that the maximum chances of survival and the best outcome for the viable fetus can be obtained. The diagnosis of the most frequently associated anomalies is also extremely important.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial component of the human gut microbiota undergoes a definable program of postnatal development. Evidence is accumulating that this program is disrupted in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and that their persistent gut microbiota immaturity, which is not durably repaired with current ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) interventions, is causally related to disease pathogenesis. To further characterize gut microbial community development in healthy versus malnourished infants/children, we performed a time-series metagenomic study of DNA isolated from virus-like particles (VLPs) recovered from fecal samples collected during the first 30 mo of postnatal life from eight pairs of mono- and dizygotic Malawian twins concordant for healthy growth and 12 twin pairs discordant for SAM. Both members of discordant pairs were sampled just before, during, and after treatment with a peanut-based RUTF. Using Random Forests and a dataset of 17,676 viral contigs assembled from shotgun sequencing reads of VLP DNAs, we identified viruses that distinguish different stages in the assembly of the gut microbiota in the concordant healthy twin pairs. This developmental program is impaired in both members of SAM discordant pairs and not repaired with RUTF. Phage plus members of the Anelloviridae and Circoviridae families of eukaryotic viruses discriminate discordant from concordant healthy pairs. These results disclose that apparently healthy cotwins in discordant pairs have viromes associated with, although not necessarily mediators, of SAM; as such, they provide a human model for delineating normal versus perturbed postnatal acquisition and retention of the gut microbiota's viral component in populations at risk for malnutrition.",

    "abstract": "Individual measures of socioeconomic status (SES) suppress genetic variance in body mass index (BMI). Our objective was to examine the influence of both individual-level (i.e., educational attainment, household income) and macrolevel (i.e., neighborhood socioeconomic advantage) SES indicators on genetic contributions to BMI.\nThe study used education level data from 4,162 monozygotic (MZ) and 1,900 dizygotic (DZ) same-sex twin pairs (64% female), income level data from 3,498 MZ and 1,534 DZ pairs (65% female), and neighborhood-level socioeconomic deprivation data from 2,327 MZ and 948 DZ pairs (65% female). Covariates included age (M = 40.4 \u00b1 17.5 years), sex, and ethnicity. The cotwin control model was used to evaluate the mechanisms through which SES influences BMI (e.g., through genetic vs. environmental pathways), and a gene-by-environment interaction model was used to test whether residual variance in BMI, after controlling for the main effects of SES, was moderated by socioeconomic measures.\nSES significantly predicted BMI. The association was noncausal, however, and instead was driven primarily through a common underlying genetic background that tended to grow less influential as SES increased. After controlling for the main effect of SES, both genetic and nonshared environmental variance decreased with increasing SES.\nThe impact of individual and macrolevel SES on BMI extends beyond its main effects. The influence of genes on BMI is moderated by individual and macrolevel measures of SES, such that when SES is higher, genetic factors become less influential.",

    "abstract": "The clinical conditions of various diseases, including coronary artery disease, are determined by genetics and the environment. Previous investigations noted the significance of genetic mutations and polymorphisms in cases of coronary spasm.\nWe report on monozygotic identical twins who almost simultaneously presented with vasospastic angina. The 58-year-old younger twin was admitted to our hospital because of persistent chest pain. An electrocardiogram showed an inverted T wave in the left precordial leads. Coronary angiographies revealed a short left main trunk (LMT) and 50% stenosis at the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Infusion of acetylcholine to his left coronary artery caused marked vasoconstriction associated with a sensation of chest oppression. Nitroglycerine completely reversed this response. Based on these findings, we diagnosed Twin A with vasospastic angina. At nearly the same time, his identical twin brother was diagnosed with vasospastic angina at another hospital. Comparison of both coronary angiograms indicated similar structure of coronary vessels, including short LMT and mild stenosis at the proximal portion of LAD.\nThese 2 cases highlight the importance of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of vasospastic angina. It may be important for individuals to receive medical attention if their identical twin presents with vasospastic angina.",

The present study examined the heritability and familiality of NSS in healthy twins and patient-relative pairs.\nThe abridged version of the Cambridge Neurological Inventory was administered to 267 pairs of monozygotic twins, 124 pairs of dizygotic twins, and 75 pairs of patients with schizophrenia and their non-psychotic first-degree relatives.\nNSS were found to have moderate but significant heritability in the healthy twin sample. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia correlated closely with their first-degree relatives on NSS.\nTaken together, the findings provide evidence on the heritability and familiality of NSS in the Han Chinese population.",

    "abstract": "To describe perinatal outcomes achieved with cord occlusion (CO) in monochorionic twins with severe selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) and abnormal umbilical artery Doppler in the IUGR twin (types II and III).\nWe studied a consecutive series of 90 cases of sIUGR with abnormal Doppler treated with CO of the IUGR fetus. Abnormal Doppler was defined as continuous (type II, n = 41) or intermittent (type III, n = 49) absent/reversed end-diastolic flow. All cases presented at least one of the following severity criteria: gestational age (GA) <22 weeks, inter-twin estimated weight discordance >35%, reversed end-diastolic umbilical artery flow or ductus venosus pulsatility index >95th centile. We prospectively recorded pregnancy course and perinatal outcome.\nMedian GA at surgery was 20.6 weeks and mean duration 22.4 min. Miscarriage (<24 weeks) occurred in 3.3% (3/90) and preterm delivery <32 weeks in 7.1% (6/84) of continuing pregnancies. GA at delivery was 36.4 weeks and neonatal survival of the larger twin was achieved in 93.3%.\nIn a consecutive series studied by an experienced team, CO in monochorionic twins with severe sIUGR type II or III was associated with delivery >32 weeks in 92.9% and neonatal survival of the normal twin in 93.3% of pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "A trend toward greater body size in dizygotic (DZ) than in monozygotic (MZ) twins has been suggested by some but not all studies, and this difference may also vary by age. We analyzed zygosity differences in mean values and variances of height and body mass index (BMI) among male and female twins from infancy to old age. Data were derived from an international database of 54 twin cohorts participating in the COllaborative project of Development of Anthropometrical measures in Twins (CODATwins), and included 842,951 height and BMI measurements from twins aged 1 to 102 years. The results showed that DZ twins were consistently taller than MZ twins, with differences of up to 2.0 cm in childhood and adolescence and up to 0.9 cm in adulthood. Similarly, a greater mean BMI of up to 0.3 kg/m2 in childhood and adolescence and up to 0.2 kg/m2 in adulthood was observed in DZ twins, although the pattern was less consistent. DZ twins presented up to 1.7% greater height and 1.9% greater BMI than MZ twins; these percentage differences were largest in middle and late childhood and decreased with age in both sexes. The variance of height was similar in MZ and DZ twins at most ages. In contrast, the variance of BMI was significantly higher in DZ than in MZ twins, particularly in childhood. In conclusion, DZ twins were generally taller and had greater BMI than MZ twins, but the differences decreased with age in both sexes.",

    "abstract": "Although a higher protein intake, particularly from vegetable sources, has been shown to be associated with higher bone mineral density (BMD) the relative impact of specific amino acids on BMD and risk of osteoporosis remains to be determined. Mechanistic research suggests that a number of specific amino acids, including five nonessential amino acids--alanine, arginine, glutamic acid, glycine, and proline--may play a role in bone health, principally through improved production of insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 and the synthesis of collagen and muscle protein. However to date, no previous studies have examined the associations between habitual intake of amino acids and direct measures of BMD and prevalence of osteoporosis or osteopenia, and no studies have examined this relationship in discordant identical twin-pairs. In these analyses of female monozygotic twin-pairs discordant for amino acid intake (n = 135), twins with higher intakes of alanine and glycine had significantly higher BMD at the spine than their co-twins with within-pair differences in spine-BMD of 0.012 g/cm(2) (SE 0.01; p = 0.039) and 0.014 g/cm(2) (SE 0.01; p = 0.026), respectively. Furthermore, in cross-sectional multivariable analyses of 3160 females aged 18 to 79 years, a higher intake of total protein was significantly associated with higher DXA-measured BMD at the spine (quartile Q4 to quartile Q1: 0.017 g/cm(2), SE 0.01, p = 0.035) and forearm (Q4 to Q1: 0.010 g/cm(2), SE 0.003, p = 0.002). Intake of six amino acids (alanine, arginine, glutamic acid, leucine, lysine, and proline) were associated with higher BMD at the spine and forearm with the strongest association observed for leucine (Q4 to Q1: 0.024 g/cm(2), SE 0.01, p = 0.007). When intakes were stratified by protein source, vegetable or animal, prevalence of osteoporosis or osteopenia was 13% to 19% lower comparing extreme quartiles of vegetable intake for five amino acids (not glutamic acid or proline). These data provide evidence to suggest that intake of protein and several amino acids, including alanine and glycine, may be beneficial for bone health, independent of genetic background.",

    "abstract": "To date, several studies have investigated the intergenerational effect of preterm and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) births. However, most studies excluded both twin mothers and twin offspring from the analyses. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the intergenerational effect of preterm birth and SGA births among twins and singletons. A prospective population-based register study of mother-firstborn offspring pairs recorded in the Swedish Medical Birth Register was performed. The study included 4,073 twins and 264,794 singletons born from 1973-1983 and their firstborns born from 1986-2009. Preterm birth was defined as birth at <37 weeks of gestation, and SGA as birth weight <2 standard deviations of the Swedish standard. Logistic regressions were performed to estimate the intergenerational effect of each birth characteristic. Adjustments were made for maternal grandmothers' and mothers' socio-demographic factors, in addition to maternal birth characteristics. Among mothers born as singletons, being born preterm was associated with an increased risk of delivering a preterm child (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.39, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.29-1.50), while being born SGA increased the likelihood of having an SGA child (adjusted OR 3.04, 95% CI = 2.80-3.30) as well as a preterm child (adjusted OR 1.30, 95% CI = 1.20-1.40). In twin mothers, the corresponding ORs tended to be lower, and the only statistically significant association was between an SGA mother and an SGA child (adjusted OR 2.15, 95% CI = 1.40-3.31). A statistically significant interaction between twinning and mother's size for gestational age was identified in a multivariate linear regression analysis, indicating that singleton mothers born SGA were associated with a lower birth weight compared with mothers not born SGA. Preterm birth and SGA appear to be transferred from one generation to the next, although not always reaching statistical significance. These effects seem to be less evident in mothers born as twins compared with those born as singletons.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins, considered to be genetically identical, cannot be distinguished from one another by standard forensic DNA testing. A recent study employed whole genome sequencing to identify extremely rare mutations and reported that mutation analysis could be used to differentiate between MZ twins. Compared with nuclear DNA, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has higher mutation rates; therefore, minor differences theoretically exist in MZ twins' mitochondrial genome (mtGenome). However, conventional Sanger-type sequencing (STS) is neither amenable to, nor feasible for, the detection of low-level sequence variants. The recent introduction of massively parallel sequencing (MPS) has the capability to sequence many targeted regions of multiple samples simultaneously with desirable depth of coverage. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess whether full mtGenome sequencing analysis can be used to differentiate between MZ twins. Ten sets of MZ twins provided blood samples that underwent extraction, quantification, mtDNA enrichment, library preparation, and ultra-deep sequencing. Point heteroplasmies were observed in eight sets of MZ twins, and a single nucleotide variant (nt15301) was detected in five sets of MZ twins. Thus, this study demonstrates that ultra-deep mtGenome sequencing could be used to differentiate between MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is essential in mammalian development. We have hypothesized that methylation differences induced by trisomy 21 (T21) contribute to the phenotypic characteristics and heterogeneity in Down syndrome (DS). In order to determine the methylation differences in T21 without interference of the interindividual genomic variation, we have used fetal skin fibroblasts from monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for T21. We also used skin fibroblasts from MZ twins concordant for T21, normal MZ twins without T21, and unrelated normal and T21 individuals. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) revealed 35 differentially methylated promoter regions (DMRs) (Absolute methylation differences = 25%, FDR < 0.001) in MZ twins discordant for T21 that have also been observed in comparison between unrelated normal and T21 individuals. The identified DMRs are enriched for genes involved in embryonic organ morphogenesis (FDR = 1.60 e -03) and include genes of the HOXB and HOXD clusters. These DMRs are maintained in iPS cells generated from this twin pair and are correlated with the gene expression changes. We have also observed an increase in DNA methylation level in the T21 methylome compared to the normal euploid methylome. This observation is concordant with the up regulation of DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMT3B and DNMT3L) and down regulation of DNA demethylation enzymes (TET2 and TET3) observed in the iPSC of the T21 versus normal twin. Altogether, the results of this study highlight the epigenetic effects of the extra chromosome 21 in T21 on loci outside of this chromosome that are relevant to DS associated phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Background. A person-centered approach focusing on the interaction of an individual's temperament-character-life events is essential in the path of individuals' well-being. In this context, three character traits, Self-directedness (e.g., self-acceptance, self-control, goal-directed behavior), Cooperativeness (e.g., social affiliation, social tolerance, empathy and helpfulness) and Self-transcendence (e.g., spiritual acceptance, transpersonal identification), measured using Cloninger's model of personality are suggested to help the individual to regulate and resolve the conflicts derived from her/his temperament combinations as a reaction to life events. However, if character is related to the individual's cognitive ability, then this association might limit any intervention that focuses on character development. We used data from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS) to investigate the relationship between personality and cognitive ability. Method. The sample consisted of 370 15-year-old twins (159 girls/211 boys), 192 of whom screen-positive with various types of mental health problems. We used the Temperament and Character Inventory to measure personality and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC-IV) to measure intelligence. The relationship was investigated using correlation analyses using random-selected twins from each dyad and separately for monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Additional analyses investigated the genetic and environmental effects on personality and cognitive ability in this specific sample. Results. There were no significant correlations between the WISC-IV indices and any of the character traits (i.e., Self-directedness, Cooperativeness, and Self-transcendence). Persistence was significantly related, if weak, to four WISC-IV indices: Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and the Full WISC-IV Scale. Post-hoc cross-twin/cross-trait analyses showed that the Persistence-cognitive ability correlation might depend on common genetic effects. The WISC-IV indices showed a relatively large genetic influence, while earlier findings about the etiology of temperament and character traits using the whole CATSS sample were replicated in this sub-sample of twins. Conclusions. The results indicate that what individuals make of themselves intentionally (i.e., their character) was not associated to intelligence. Persistence, a temperament dimension that measures heritable individual differences in eagerness of effort, ambition, perfectionism, and resistance to discouragement despite frustration and fatigue, was weakly linked to intelligence. Suggesting that, at least during adolescence, interventions targeting character development are not limited by the individual's intelligence.",

    "abstract": "To our knowledge, this is the first study on rosacea to formally define genetic and environmental contributions.\nTo study a cohort of identical and fraternal twins to determine whether genetic factors contribute to rosacea development and, if genetic factors are present, quantitatively estimate the genetic contribution, as well as to identify environmental factors that correlate with rosacea by controlling for genetic susceptibility.\nIdentical and fraternal twins were surveyed regarding risk factors implicated in rosacea. Faculty dermatologists determined a rosacea score for each twin participant according to the National Rosacea Society (NRS) grading system. Data were collected at the annual Twins Days Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, on August 4-5, 2012, and August 2-3, 2013. Analysis was conducted for several months after each meeting. A cohort of 550 twin individuals, with most from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the northeastern United States, participated.\nThe NRS score and rosacea subtype were assessed using the NRS grading system and physical examination by board-certified dermatologists.\nAmong the 275 twin pairs (550 individuals), there were 233 identical twin pairs with a mean rosacea score of 2.46 and 42 fraternal twin pairs with a mean rosacea score of 0.75. We observed a higher association of NRS scores between identical vs fraternal twins (r\u2009=\u20090.69 vs r\u2009=\u20090.46; P\u2009=\u2009.04), demonstrating a genetic contribution. Using the ACE model (proportion of variance in a trait heritable secondary to additive genetics [A] vs the proportions due to a common environment [C] and unique environment [E]), we calculated this genetic contribution to be 46%. A higher NRS score was also significantly associated with the following factors: age (r\u2009=\u20090.38; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and lifetime UV radiation exposure (r\u2009=\u20090.26; P\u2009<\u2009.001). These associations remained after use of propensity score matching to adjust for multicollinearity. Other correlated variables included body mass index (r\u2009=\u20090.21; P\u2009<\u2009.001), smoking (r\u2009=\u20090.10; P\u2009<\u2009.02), alcohol consumption (r\u2009=\u20090.11; P\u2009=\u2009.01), cardiovascular comorbidity (r\u2009=\u20090.17; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and skin cancer comorbidity (r\u2009=\u20090.19; P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nThe study of twins allows us to separate genetic susceptibility and the influence of environmental factors affecting rosacea. We found that approximately half of the contribution to the NRS score could be accounted for by genetics and the other half by environment. We identified correlations between rosacea and UV radiation exposure, alcohol, smoking, skin cancer history, cardiac comorbidity, and age. These findings may help improve current management and expectations of individuals affected by rosacea.",

    "abstract": "Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation, and Autonomic Dysregulation (ROHHAD) is thought to be a genetic disease caused by de novo mutations, though causative mutations have yet to be identified. We searched for de novo coding mutations among a carefully-diagnosed and clinically homogeneous cohort of 35 ROHHAD patients.\nWe sequenced the exomes of seven ROHHAD trios, plus tumours from four of these patients and the unaffected monozygotic (MZ) twin of one (discovery cohort), to identify constitutional and somatic de novo sequence variants. We further analyzed this exome data to search for candidate genes under autosomal dominant and recessive models, and to identify structural variations. Candidate genes were tested by exome or Sanger sequencing in a replication cohort of 28 ROHHAD singletons.\nThe analysis of the trio-based exomes found 13 de novo variants. However, no two patients had de novo variants in the same gene, and additional patient exomes and mutation analysis in the replication cohort did not provide strong genetic evidence to implicate any of these sequence variants in ROHHAD. Somatic comparisons revealed no coding differences between any blood and tumour samples, or between the two discordant MZ twins. Neither autosomal dominant nor recessive analysis yielded candidate genes for ROHHAD, and we did not identify any potentially causative structural variations.\nClinical exome sequencing is highly unlikely to be a useful diagnostic test in patients with true ROHHAD. As ROHHAD has a high risk for fatality if not properly managed, it remains imperative to expand the search for non-exomic genetic risk factors, as well as to investigate other possible mechanisms of disease. In so doing, we will be able to confirm objectively the ROHHAD diagnosis and to contribute to our understanding of obesity, respiratory control, hypothalamic function, and autonomic regulation.",

However, no two patients had de novo variants in the same gene, and additional patient exomes and mutation analysis in the replication cohort did not provide strong genetic evidence to implicate any of these sequence variants in ROHHAD. Somatic comparisons revealed no coding differences between any blood and tumour samples, or between the two discordant MZ twins. Neither autosomal dominant nor recessive analysis yielded candidate genes for ROHHAD, and we did not identify any potentially causative structural variations.",

    "abstract": "We report our experience on the application of Gratacos' classification in a cohort of monochorionic pregnancies complicated by selective intra-uterine growth retardation based on the Doppler assessment of the umbilical artery.\nA retrospective study was conducted on 52 cases of monochorionic twin pregnancies, in which one twin presented an abdominal circumference at or below the 10th percentile for gestational age. Cases were classified into three types according to the umbilical artery Doppler in the smaller twin. Subsequently, patients were divided into two groups: the selective IntraUterine Growth Retardation group and the Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS) group.\nOf the total 52 cases, 37 were classified as Type I, 12 as Type II, and 3 as Type III cases. In the total group, progressive fetal deterioration of the smaller fetus requiring active management was observed in 66.7% of Type II and 11.1% of Type I cases (p < .001), and in no Type III case. Unexpected fetal death of the smaller twin was observed more frequently in Type III (two cases, 66.7%) than in Types I and II cases (5% and 33%, respectively). Among the 52 cases, TTTS with oligo-polyhydramnios sequence was diagnosed in 10 cases. The remaining 42 cases were therefore defined as selective intra-uterine growth retardation. In the selective IntraUterine Growth Retardation group, results were similar to those obtained for the whole population.\nClassification of complicated monochorionic twins based on the umbilical artery Doppler is particularly important for counseling, even when we include TTTS cases, and permits the prediction of clinical evolution and perinatal outcome.",

    "abstract": "We set out to examine rates of perinatal mortality in twin pregnancies over a 17-year study period. Changes in mode of delivery were also examined as well as causes of death in twin mortalities.\nThis retrospective cohort study was performed at three large tertiary referral centers from 1996 to 2012. It included all normally formed twin infants with a birth weight more than 500 g. All cases of perinatal mortality in twin pregnancies (infants more than 500\u2009g who suffered an intrauterine or early neonatal (\u2264 7 days of age) death were recorded. The changing rate of cesarean delivery as well as varying causes of death in twins over the course of the study were also examined.\nDuring the study period, there were 395,830 pregnancies across the three institutions, this included 6,727 twin gestations. The perinatal mortality rate was 21.5/1,000 twin infants. The perinatal mortality rate in twins decreased over the study period (p\u2009=\u20090.0006; R (2)\u2009=\u20090.55; slope\u2009=\u2009-1.2). Rates of cesarean delivery in twin gestations were found to have increased over the course of the study (p\u2009<\u20090.0001; R (2)\u2009=\u20090.84; slope\u2009=\u20091.7). There were 288 intrauterine and early neonatal deaths in twin infants, 50% (147/288) occurred in twins born extremely premature (< 26 weeks). Prematurity was the leading cause of mortality in twins, followed by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). TTTS was found to have a decreasing contribution to perinatal mortality during the study (p\u2009=\u20090.008; R (2)\u2009=\u20090.38; slope\u2009=\u2009-1.5).\nThe perinatal mortality rate in twins improved during the study. The rate of cesarean delivery increased by 1.7% for each year of the study, culminating in a cesarean delivery rate of 62% in 2012.

    "abstract": "The increasing number of multiple pregnancies in recent years has raised a particular concern about the problems associated to these pregnancies. It still remains unclear whether twin deliveries, as currently conceived, provide the same future health chances to both fetuses. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that the effects of obstetric and neonatal care beyond the perinatal period have not often been evaluated. The main objective of this research was to analyze the impact of obstetric and perinatal variables on postnatal neuropsychological development, intelligence and school achievement of twin children.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional and observational study on 62 pairs of 6-year-old twins, who were on their first year of primary education. All 124 children and their mother were individually assessed and perinatal clinical data were collected. A stratified multivariate analysis was performed using multiple linear regressions.\nThe type of birth was the best predicting variable, so that the best results were achieved in children born in spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Comparatively, however, poorer scores were seen in males second twins born by the vaginal route in spatial structuring, non-verbal development and total development areas, especially in case of delivery before 37 weeks.\nOur study confirms the impact of some obstetric variables on school achievement and psychological development of twins.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancy- and birth-related factors may have an effect on handedness. Compared with singletons, twins have a lower birth weight, shorter gestational age, and are at higher risk for birth complications. We tested whether the prevalence of left-handedness is higher among twins than singletons, and if so, whether that difference is fully explained by pregnancy and birth-related differences between twins and singletons. We analyzed Finnish population-based datasets; included were 8,786 twins and 5,892 singletons with information on birth weight (n = 12,381), Apgar scores (n = 11,129), and gestational age (n = 11,811). Two twin cohorts were involved: FinnTwin12 included twins born during 1983-1987, and FinnTwin16 included twins born during 1974-1979. We had two comparison groups of singletons: 4,101 individuals born during 1986-1988 and enrolled in the Helsinki Ultrasound Trial, and 1,791 individuals who were partners of FinnTwin16 twins. We used logistic regression models with writing hand as the outcome for comparison and evaluating effects of covariates. Left-handedness was more common in twins (9.67%) than in singletons (8.27%; p = .004). However, Apgar scores were associated with handedness, and after controlling for covariates, we found no difference in the prevalence of left-handedness between twins and singletons. Increased left-handedness among twins, often reported by others, was evident in our data, but only among our older twin cohorts, and that association disappeared after removing effects of perinatal covariates.",

    "abstract": "We used quantitative genetic models to assess whether area-level deprivation as indicated by the Singh Index predicts shorter sleep duration and modifies its underlying genetic and environmental contributions.\nParticipants were 4,218 adult twin pairs (2,377 monozygotic and 1,841 dizygotic) from the University of Washington Twin Registry. Participants self-reported habitual sleep duration. The Singh Index was determined by linking geocoding addresses to 17 indicators at the census-tract level using data from Census of Washington State and Census Tract Cartographic Boundary Files from 2000 and 2010. Data were analyzed using univariate and bivariate genetic decomposition and quantitative genetic interaction models that assessed A (additive genetics), C (common environment), and E (unique environment) main effects of the Singh Index on sleep duration and allowed the magnitude of residual ACE variance components in sleep duration to vary with the Index.\nThe sample had a mean age of 38.2 y (standard deviation [SD] = 18), and was predominantly female (62%) and Caucasian (91%). Mean sleep duration was 7.38 h (SD = 1.20) and the mean Singh Index score was 0.00 (SD = 0.89). The heritability of sleep duration was 39% and the Singh Index was 12%. The uncontrolled phenotypic regression of sleep duration on the Singh Index showed a significant negative relationship between area-level deprivation and sleep length (b = -0.080, P < 0.001). Every 1 SD in Singh Index was associated with a \u223c4.5 min change in sleep duration. For the quasi-causal bivariate model, there was a significant main effect of E (b(0E) = -0.063; standard error [SE] = 0.30; P < 0.05). Residual variance components unique to sleep duration were significant for both A (b(0Au) = 0.734; SE = 0.020; P < 0.001) and E (b(0Eu) = 0.934; SE = 0.013; P < 0.001).\nArea-level deprivation has a quasi-causal association with sleep duration, with greater deprivation being related to shorter sleep. As area-level deprivation increases, unique genetic and nonshared environmental residual variance in sleep duration increases.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence shows that some cancers originate in utero. It is hypothesized that elevated exposure to some steroid hormones might increase cancer risk and that hormone transfer between twin fetuses could result in different prenatal exposure to testosterone.\nThis large-scale prospective twin study compared opposite-sex (OS) and same-sex (SS) twins to test the impact of intrauterine exposures on cancer risk. On the basis of the Danish and Swedish twin and cancer registries, we calculated incidence rate ratios for OS and SS twins, whereas standardized incidence ratios (SIR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for OS/SS twins compared with the general population.\nA total of 18,001 cancers were identified during 1943-2009. No significant differences were observed between OS and SS twins, neither for the sex-specific cancers nor for cancer at all sites. All-cause cancer was slightly reduced for OS and SS twins compared with the general population, significant for OS males (SIR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.98) and for SS males and females (SIR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99).\nOur data suggest that having a male co-twin-which may entail higher exposure to prenatal testosterone-does not increase the risk of sex-specific cancers in OS females. Furthermore, the study supports that twinning per se is not a risk factor of cancer.\nFindings are reassuring, as they fail to provide evidence for the hypothesis that endocrine or other difference in the in utero milieu affects the risk of sex-specific cancers.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal and early postnatal adversities have been shown to be associated with brain development. However, we do not know how much of this association is confounded by genetics, nor whether the postnatal environment can moderate the impact of in utero adversity. This study used a monozygotic (MZ) twin design to assess (1) the association between birth weight (BW) and brain volume in adolescence, (2) the association between within-twin-pair BW discordance and brain volume discordance in adolescence, and (3) whether the association between BW and brain volume in adolescence is mediated or moderated by early negative maternal parenting behaviours. These associations were assessed in a sample of 108 MZ twins followed longitudinally since birth and scanned at age 15. The total grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes were obtained using the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) toolbox in the Statistical Parametric Mapping version 8 (SPM8). We found that the BW was significantly associated with the total GM and WM volumes, particularly in the superior frontal gyrus and thalamus. Within-twin-pair discordance in BW was also significantly associated with within-pair discordance in both the GM and the WM volumes, supporting the hypothesis that the specific in utero environment is associated with brain development independently of genetics. Early maternal hostile parenting behaviours and depressive symptoms were associated with total GM volume but not WM volume. Finally, greater early maternal hostility may moderate the association between the BW and GM volume in adolescence, since the positive association between the BW and total GM volume appeared stronger at higher levels of maternal hostility (trend). Together, these findings support the importance of the in utero and early environments for brain development.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between sleep quality and pain has been studied in populations with chronic pain and in nonclinical populations using experimental paradigms. Little is known about the familial contributions to this relationship. This study examines self-reported sleep quality and pain in a nonclinical sample and to explore familial (i.e., shared genetic and common family environment) confounding in those relationships.\nCross-sectional.\nNinety nine community-based female twin pairs (N = 198) with a mean age of 29 years; 72% monozygotic.\nThe short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (McGill), a visual analog scale (VAS), a body map, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) measured self-reported pain and sleep quality. Mixed model regression adjusted for age was used to examine relationships between the pain indices and PSQI in overall and within-pair models.\nHigher PSQI total scores were significantly associated with higher scores across the McGill sensory (B = 0.37, p < 0.001), affective (B = 0.16, p < 0.001), total scores (B = 0.54, p < 0.001), the VAS (B = 2.41, p < 0.001), and number of sites with any pain on the body map (B = 0.42, p = 0.001). All of these associations were diminished and rendered nonsignificant in within-pair analyses that accounted for genetic and familial factors (all p's \u2265 0.01; Bonferroni \u03b1 = 0.01).\nThese findings support an association between poor sleep quality and pain and suggest that this relationship may be confounded by shared genetic and environmental factors, which could elucidate biological mechanisms that underlie the development and maintenance of pain and sleep problems.",

    "abstract": "Hypospadias is associated with twinning. The incidence of hypospadias in monochorionic and dichorionic male twins is, however, yet to be determined.\nAll medical records of monochorionic and dichorionic twins admitted to our neonatal nursery between January 2004 and August 2013 were reviewed for the presence of hypospadias.\nA total of 350 monochorionic and 303 dichorionic male twins were included in the study. The incidence of hypospadias in monochorionic and dichorionic groups was 4% (14/350) and 1% (3/303) (p = .016) respectively. In 11 of the 15 twin couples, hypospadias occurred in the twin with the lowest birth weight. The rate of hypospadias in twin infants small-for-gestational-age group was 10% (6/60) compared with 2% (11/593) in the appropriate-for-gestational-age group (p = .002). In a multivariate analysis, both monochorionicity and small-for-gestational-age were independently associated with hypospadias, odds ratio 4.1 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-14.7) and 6.1 (95% CI: 2.2-17.2) respectively.\nThe incidence of hypospadias is four-fold higher in monochorionic twins compared with dichorionic twins. Hypospadias is also independently associated with small-for-gestational-age.",

    "abstract": "Single fetal death (sFD) in monochorionic twin pregnancies is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in the survivor. The aim of our study was to evaluate the rate of cerebral lesions detected at fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and to correlate the results with the neurologic outcome of the survivors of monochorionic twin pregnancies after sFD.\nBetween 2005 and 2012, 11 monochorionic twin pregnancies with sFD and subsequent fetal MRI of the survivor were included. All neonates underwent neurologic assessment after birth and 56% of surviving infants underwent long-term neurologic assessment. MRI findings and neurologic outcome of the survivors were evaluated.\nGestational age at sFD was 20.9 (\u00b12.9) weeks; 55% (6/11) of survivors of monochorionic twin pregnancies after sFD showed cerebral lesions at fetal MRI; 72% (8/11) of all survivors had normal neonatal neurologic outcome: all survivors with normal fetal MRI and 50% of survivors with cerebral lesions at fetal MRI. Long-term neurologic assessment was normal in all tested patients with normal fetal MRI and in one of three tested patients with cerebral lesions at fetal MRI.\nSurvivors of monochorionic twin pregnancies after sFD show a high rate of cerebral lesions at fetal MRI. The importance of cerebral lesions at fetal MRI in survivors after sFD in monochorionic twin pregnancies is uncertain. All tested survivors with normal fetal MRI showed normal neurologic outcome but only one of three survivors with cerebral lesions at fetal MRI showed normal long-term neurologic outcome.",

All monozygotic twins should be thoroughly evaluated for incomplete separation and, if incomplete separation is diagnosed, the extent of internal organ connection and the presence of additional developmental anomalies of the foetuses should be assessed.

We present an example of female thoracoomohalopagus twins with a common triventricular heart, connate livers, and joined hepatic vessels, diagnosed in week 12 of pregnancy Due to the high complexity of foetal connection, separation was not possible and following interdisciplinary consultation, the pregnancy was aborted upon the patient's request in week 16.",

Traditionally, incision and drainage has been the treatment of choice, but several studies suggest conservative management. The effect of antibiotics has not been proven.

    "abstract": "Menkes disease (MD) is a rare X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene. This neurodegenerative disorder typically affects males and is characterized by impaired copper distribution and the malfunction of several copper-dependent enzymes. We report clinically discordant female monozygotic twins (MZT) with a heterozygous ATP7A mutation. One twin girl is healthy at the current age of 4 years, whereas the other twin girl developed classical MD, showed disease stabilization under copper histidine treatment but died at the age of 3 years. Presumably, the affected girl developed MD due to skewed X inactivation, although this could not be demonstrated in two tissues (blood, buccal mucosa). This case is a rare example of an affected girl with MD and shows the possibility of a discordant phenotype in MZT girls. As speculated in other X-linked diseases, the process of monozygotic twinning may be associated with skewed X inactivation leading to a discordant phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Using a sample of monozygotic (945, 42\u2005per cent) and dizygotic (1,329, 58\u2005per cent) twin pairs born 1919-68 in the UK, we applied innovative tobit models to investigate genetic and environmental influences on age at first birth (AFB). We found that a substantial part (40\u2005per cent) of the variation in AFB is caused by latent family characteristics. Genetic dispositions (26\u2005per cent) play a more important role than the shared environment of siblings (14\u2005per cent), with the non-shared environment/measurement error having the strongest influence (60\u2005per cent). Like previous studies, this study reveals marked changes in estimates over time, and supports the idea that environmental constraints (war or economic crisis) suppress and normative freedom (sexual revolution) promotes the activation of genetic predispositions that affect fertility. We show that the exclusion of censored information (i.e., on the childless) by previous studies biased their results.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether depression symptomatology is associated with low back pain (LBP) in twins aged 70+ and whether this effect depends on a person's physical activity (PA) status.\nThis prospective cohort and nested case-control study used a nationally representative sample of twins. Data on depression symptomatology (modified Cambridge Mental Disorders Examination) and self-reported PA were obtained from the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins using twins without LBP at baseline. Associations between depression symptomatology (highest quartile) at baseline and LBP two years later were investigated using logistic regression analyses adjusted for sex. To examine the moderating effect of PA, we tested its interaction with depression. Associations were analysed using the complete sample of 2446 twins and a matched case-control analysis of 97 twin pairs discordant for LBP at follow-up. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.\nUsing the whole sample, high depression scores were associated with an increased probability of LBP (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.22-1.99, P \u2264 0.01). There was no statistically significant interaction of light PA and depression symptomatology (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46-1.35, P = 0.39) and strenuous PA and depression symptomatology (0.84, 95% CI 0.50-1.41, P = 0.51). The case-control analysis showed similar ORs, although statistically insignificant.\nHigh depression symptomatology predicted incident LBP. This effect is supposedly not attributable to genetic or shared environmental factors. Physical activity did not moderate the effect of depression symptomatology on LBP.",

    "abstract": "Chorion type may significantly influence the prenatal environment of twins. This study explored the associations between chorion type and gestational age, birth weight, birth length, and the timing of emergence of the first primary tooth in two populations of twins, Australian and Dutch. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between chorion type and birth weight discordance (BWD) in order to determine whether a significant relationship existed between discordance in birth weight and discordance in the timing of emergence of the first primary tooth. The two study samples consisted of 409 Australian twin pairs and 301 Dutch twin pairs, all of European ancestry. Data were collected through a combination of questionnaires and recording charts administered to the parents and through linkage with biological databases. In the Australian sample, monozygotic monochorionic (MZMC) twins experienced the shortest mean gestation time (35 weeks), the lowest mean birth length (46 cm) and the lowest mean birth weight (2.3 kg) compared with other twin groups. For the same variables in the Dutch sample, these trends with MZMC twinning were not observed. Chorion type did not significantly affect the mean timing of emergence of the first primary tooth in either sample. Monochorionicity was found to be significantly associated with BWD in both samples, but there was a significant association between BWD in MZMC twin pairs and timing of emergence of the first primary tooth only in the Australian sample. Results from this study support previous findings that the timing of emergence of the first primary tooth is influenced strongly by genetic factors and is well protected from environmental disturbances.",

    "abstract": "Discriminating individuals within a pair of monozygotic (MZ) twins using genetic markers remains unresolved. This inability causes problems in criminal or paternity cases involving MZ twins as suspects or alleged fathers. Our previous study showed DNA methylation differences in interspersed repeat sequences such as Alu and LINE-1 within pairs of newborn MZ twins. To further evaluate the possible value of LINE-1 DNA methylation for discriminating MZ twins, this study investigated the LINE-1 DNA methylation of a large number of twins. We collected blood samples and buccal cell samples from 119 pairs of MZ and 57 pairs of dizygotic (DZ) twins. Genomic DNA was extracted and LINE-1 methylation level was detected using bisulfite pyrosequencing. The mean methylation level of the three CpG sites in the blood sample among the 176 unrelated individuals was 76.60% and 70.08% in buccal samples. This difference was significant, indicating the tissue specificity of LINE-1 DNA methylation. Among 119 pairs of MZ twins, 15 pairs could be discriminated according to the difference of CpG methylation level between them, which accounted for 12.61% of total number of MZ pairs. As for DZ twins, 10 pairs had significant differences between two individuals, which accounted for 17.54% of the total 57 DZ pairs. In conclusion, there are global DNA methylation differences within some healthy concordant monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs. LINE-1 DNA methylation might be a potential marker for helping to discriminate individuals within MZ twin pairs, and the tissue specificity must be considered in practice.",

    "abstract": "In biology proteins from different structural classes interact across and within classes in ways that are optimized to achieve balanced functional outputs. The interactions between intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and other proteins rely on changes in flexibility and this is seen as a strong determinant for their function. This has fostered the notion that IDP's bind with low affinity but high specificity. Here we have analyzed available detailed thermodynamic data for protein-protein interactions to put to the test if the thermodynamic profiles of IDP interactions differ from those of other protein-protein interactions. We find that ordered proteins and the disordered ones act as non-identical twins operating by similar principles but where the disordered proteins complexes are on average less stable by 2.5 kcal mol(-1).",

    "abstract": "The knowledge about adaptive mechanisms of monochorionic placentas to fulfill the demands of two instead of one fetus is largely speculative. The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of chorionicity on birth weight and placental weight in twin pregnancies.\nForty Monochorionic (MC) and 43 dichorionic (DC) twin pregnancies were included in this retrospective study. Individual and total (sum of both twins) birth weights, placental weights ratios between placental and birth weights and observed-to-expected (O/E)-ratios were calculated and analyzed. Additionally, we investigated whether in twin pregnancies placental and birth weights follow the law of allometric metabolic scaling.\nMC pregnancies showed higher placental O/E-ratios than DC ones (2.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.85 versus 1.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.61; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas the total neonatal birth weight O/E-ratios were not different. In DC twins total placental weights correlated significantly with gestational age (r\u00a0=\u00a00.74, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but not in MC twins. Analysis of deliveries \u226432 weeks revealed that the placenta to birth weight ratio in MC twins was higher than in matched DC twins (0.49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 versus 0.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Allometric metabolic scaling revealed that dichorionic twin placentas scale with birth weight, while the monochorionic ones do not.\nThe weight of MC placentas compared to that of DC is not gestational age dependent in the third trimester. Therefore an early accelerated placental growth pattern has to be postulated which leads to an excess placental mass particularly below 32 weeks of gestation. The monochorionic twins do not follow allometric metabolic scaling principle making them more vulnerable to placental compromise.",

    "abstract": "Shared psychotic disorder, characterized by shared delusion among two or more subjects (termed \"Folie \u00e0 deux,\" \"trois,\" etc.), is often associated with strong religious beliefs or social isolation, factors creating strong psychological sympathy. Recently, we treated a rare familial case of \"Folie \u00e0 quatre\" in central Tokyo without such influences. The proband was a schizophrenia patient and younger brother within monozygotic twins. Positive symptoms were \"transmitted\" to remaining family members, his elder brother, mother, and father father, in a relatively short period of three months. Although the pathophysiology of these positive symptoms (delusions and hallucinations) remains unclear, the transmission pattern suggests the primacy of social and environmental factors (and/or their interaction), while genetics appeared less influential in this \"Folie \u00e0 famille.\" Although undiagnosed psychoses in the whole family cannot be excluded, they did not share the other negative schizophrenia symptoms of the proband. A strong familial connection appeared to be the most important factor for the common delusion and hallucination.",

    "abstract": "There continues to be disagreement related to the appropriate therapeutic regimen to be used when the donor and the recipient in kidney transplant operations are identical twins. Here we present two cases of kidney transplantation between identical twins. Both recipients had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) caused by primary nephropathy. We also present information gleaned from a literature review of similar cases. The first recipient was a 26-year-old man who experienced biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy 10 months post-transplantation. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and steroids were used to reverse this pathologic condition. Till now, 76 months post-transplantation, the patient is stable, and the new kidney is functioning well. The second recipient was a 20-year-old woman who had hematuria and proteinuria 3 months post-transplantation, and crescent glomerulonephritis with mild to moderate interstitial injury was proven by biopsy 11 months postoperatively. This patient did not respond to various treatments and resumed hemodialysis 15 months post-transplantation. These case studies show that immunosuppressive therapy should be maintained in kidney transplant recipients who are identical twins with ESRD caused by initial nephropathy.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanism behind the structure of the internal cellular clock can lead to advances in the knowledge of origins of pairs of monozygotic twins and higher order multiples as well as other biological phenomena. To gain insight into this mechanism, we analyze possible cell labeling schemes that model an organism's development. Our findings lead us to predict that monozygotic quadruplets are not quadruplets in the traditional sense but rather two pairs of monozygotic twins where the pairs slightly differ-a situation we coin quadruplet twins. From the considered model, the probability of monozygotic twins is found to be (1/2) (K) , and we discover that the probability of monozygotic quadruplets, or triplets as in the case of the death of an embryo, is (1/8) (K) , where K is a species-specific integer representing the number of pairs of homologous chromosomes. The parameter K may determine cancerization with a probability threshold that is approximately inversely proportional to the Hayflick limit. Exposure to some cancerization factors such as small levels of ionizing radiation and chemical pollution may not produce cancer.",

    "abstract": "The genetic influence on dental arch morphology may be country-specific, thus it is reasonable to check the estimates of genetics across different populations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the heredity of dental arch morphology in the sample of Lithuanian twins with accurate zygosity determination.\nThe study sample consisted of digital dental models of 40 monozygotic (MZ) and 32 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. The estimates of heritability (h(2)) for dental arch breadth and length were calculated.\nAll dental arch breadths and lengths were statistically significantly larger in men than in women. Arch length differences between genders were less expressed than largest breadth differences. In the upper jaw the largest genetic effect was found on the arch breadth between lateral incisors. The heritability of dental arch length demonstrated similar differences between upper and lower jaw with mandible dental arch length being more genetically determined.\nThe largest genetic impact was found on the upper dental arch breadth between lateral incisors. Similar, but lower heritability is inherent for canines and first premolars of the upper jaw and first premolars of the lower jaw. It also can be noted, that arch breadths between posterior teeth show lower heritability estimates than between anterior teeth on both jaws. The dental arch in the upper jaw has more expressed genetic component than in the lower jaw.",

    "abstract": "In monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies, unequal placental sharing does not always lead to adverse outcomes. The aim of this study is to investigate how unequal placental sharing may be compensated by placental anatomical changes.\nBetween January 2012 and July 2013, a total of 60 uncomplicated MCDA pregnancies ending in live birth of healthy twins were studied. Placentas were divided into two groups; an equally shared placenta group (placenta territory discordance \u2264 25%, N = 40) and an unequally shared placenta group (placenta territory discordance >25%, N = 20). Angioarchitecture, cord insertion type and the distance between two cord insertions were compared.\nVascular anastomoses were seen in all 60 placentas, and 58 placentas (96.7%) had arterioarterial anastomoses (AA). The overall diameter of the AA was larger in the unequally shared placenta group as compared to the equally shared placentas (0.27 \u00b1 0.12 cm versus 0.19 \u00b1 0.1 cm, p < 0.05). The distance between the cord insertions was shorter in the unequally shared group (14.5 \u00b1 6.0 cm versus 18.3 \u00b1 6.5 cm, p < 0.05).\nThe absence of adverse outcomes in unequally shared placenta group can be explained by the presence of large AA and shorter distance between cord insertions, protecting the twin with the smaller placental part against growth restriction and other pathology.",

    "abstract": "Increased utilization of in vitro fertilization (IVF) to treat infertility has resulted in a growing twin birthrate. Despite early childhood risks, twins have fewer psychosocial problems in middle childhood than singleton children. This study proposes that parents' conformity expectations for children have differential effects on parent-child relationships for twin and singleton children, which indirectly explains twins' more optimum psychosocial adjustment. Parental conformity expectations, parent-child relationship satisfaction, and children's emotional, behavioral, and attention problems were assessed in a sample of 288 6- to 12-year-old IVF-conceived twins and singletons. Overall, parents of twins had higher expectations for child conformity to parent rules than singleton parents. Path models demonstrate that twin status and parental expectations for child conformity interact to influence parent-child relationships, and this interaction indirectly accounted for differences in twins' and singletons' psychosocial adjustment. Findings suggest parenting constructs have differential influences on the association between twin status and parent-child relationships. Parenting research, predominantly conducted with singletons, should be reexamined before applying existing research to twin children and their families.",

Data analysis was performed with SPPS version 15 for Windows using analysis of variance and Fisher's Exact test.\n132 triplet pregnancies were identified. In the reduced group (\nWomen electing to reduce a triplet pregnancy to twins have higher gestational ages at delivery, lower rates of gestational diabetes and preterm labor, and spent fewer days in hospital than non-reduced triplet pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Renal transplantation without maintenance immunosuppression has been sporadically reported in the literature. The cases include non-adherent patients who discontinued their immunosuppressive medications, transplantation between identical twins, kidney transplantation after a successful bone marrow graft from the same donor and simultaneous bone marrow and kidney transplantation for the treatment of multiple myeloma with associated renal failure. There are also ongoing clinical trials designed to induce donor specific transplant tolerance with infusion of hematopoietic cells from the same kidney donor. Here we describe two cases of renal transplantation without immunosuppression as examples of situations described above.",

    "abstract": "The mother-offspring social unit is a universal feature in the social life of all mammals and nursing is the most direct and vital component of maternal investment in young. Living in diverse environments, various ungulate species have different strategies for rearing offspring, from bearing a single, relatively large newborn and supplying only limited amounts of milk, to bearing several relatively small newborns with intensive post-partum lactation. In this paper, we consider the rearing strategy of goitered gazelle with a focus on suckling behavior, which, until now, has never been a subject of special investigation. Adult females of this species in their reproductive prime typically bear twins when environmental conditions are favorable, but the proportion of singletons increases when conditions are unfavorable. We expected that in goitered gazelles suckling intensity would be maximal during the first weeks after birth, and then decrease with the growth of the young; we also expected that twins would demand more energy, but receive significantly less maternal investment per young than singletons. We found that, indeed, suckling behavior had similar dynamics as typical of all bovid species, but our expectation for less maternal investment in twins vs. singletons was wrong. In reality, female goitered gazelles suckled twins significantly more intensively and terminated suckling less often compared to singletons. We concluded that in favorable situations females of high quality have the ability to show significantly more maternal investment in each twin, while singletons are typically born to weaker females. This ability of females to produce mostly twins allows goitered gazelles to take advantage of any favorable opportunity to quickly increase their population in an environment with unpredictable and abrupt yearly changes typical of the arid regions of Central Asia.",
