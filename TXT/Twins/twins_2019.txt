    "abstract": "Glenoid version is the most variable parameter of the shoulder joint. No authors investigated if intrinsic genetic factors or influences from extrinsic sources are responsible for its variability.\nWe compared glenoid version between elderly monozygotic and dizygotic twins intending to separate the contributions of genetics from shared and unique environments.\nGlenoid version of the dominant shoulder was assessed by MRI using Friedman's method in 30 pairs of elderly twins (16 monozygotic-14 dizygotic; mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD: 63.72\u2009\u00b1\u20093.37, 53-72). Heritability was estimated as twice the difference between the intraclass correlation coefficients for monozygotic and dizygotic pairs. The influence of shared environment was calculated as the difference between monozygotic correlation coefficient and the heritability index. According to job category, one way analysis of variance was used to estimate the differences between groups in the total sample and within zygosity groups.\nGlenoid version angle in monozygotic and dizygotic twins was -2\u00b0 (SD: 2\u00b0) and -3\u00b0 (SD: 3\u00b0), respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.334). Heritability index was 0.98, while the contributions of shared and unique environment were 0 and 0.02, respectively. According to working classes, no significant differences were found between the groups (p\u2009=\u20090.732, F\u2009=\u20090.31).\nGlenoid version is mainly genetically determined and only marginally influenced by environments.",

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis. It involves both genetic and environmental factors, among which DNA methylation, the most studied epigenetic modification, was shown to play a role. Here, we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profiles in 2 pairs of IgAN-discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins, in order to characterize methylation changes and their potential influences on gene expression in IgAN.\nGenome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profiles were evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 2 IgAN-discordant MZ twins. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected, and an integrated analysis was performed. Finally, functional enrichment analysis was done for DMR-associated genes and DEGs.\nTotally 521 DMRs were detected for 2 IgAN-discordant MZ twins. Among them, 9 DMRs were found to be mapped to genes that differentially expressed in 2 MZ twins, indicating the potential regulatory mechanisms of expression for these 9 genes (\nOur findings indicate that changes in DNA methylation patterns were involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN. Nine target genes detected in our study may provide new ideas for the exploration of molecular mechanisms of IgAN.",

The disease was first reported in Wuhan, China in 2019 and has rapidly spread worldwide. Despite reports of dynamic changes in disease progression, clinical predictors of disease severity have been difficult to identify. The following case describing identical twins with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who had very different disease courses. These patients resided in the same home and shared many of the same comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and morbid obesity. Although twin 1 had higher inflammatory markers, white blood cell (WBC) and an arguably more complicated medical history in comparison to their identical twin, the patient experienced a milder and shorter disease course. This case highlights the need for identifying proper disease markers and predictors early in the clinical course in order to direct future management guidelines and timely treatment.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to explore the raters' agreement and the effect of raters' and targets' gender on self- and parental intelligence assessments in the sample of Croatian twins. Twins were asked to assess their own and their parents' overall intelligence, as well as specific abilities from the Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences. Data was analysed to explore: i) twins' agreement in parental assessments and behavioural genetic analysis of the overall intelligence estimates; ii) gender differences in self- assessments; and iii) raters' and targets' gender effects on parental assessments. The twins' mean correlation in their assessments of overall parental intelligence was .60. The differences between monozygotic and dizygotic twin correlations were nonsignificant for all of the estimated abilities, and model fitting analysis indicates that hypothesis about genetic effect on parental assessment of intelligence should be rejected. The hypotheses about males' higher self-assessments for overall intelligence and for the masculine types of abilities - logical-mathematical, body-kinesthetic and spatial abilities - were confirmed. For the feminine types of abilities - verbal/linguistic, inter- and intra- personal intelligences - there were no significant gender effects. Both target and rater effect were found for the parental estimates of intelligence. Fathers were estimated higher on overall intelligence, logical-mathematical, body-kinesthetic and spatial abilities, while mothers were estimated higher on interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence. The effect of the raters' gender was found for overall intelligence as well as for inter- and intra- personal intelligences, where males gave higher estimates of parental intelligences than females.",

    "abstract": "Newborns are at high risk for identification errors due to their inability to speak and indistinguishable features. To reduce this risk, The Joint Commission requires hospitals to use a distinct identification method for newborns. Most hospitals create medical records for newborns at birth using temporary naming conventions, resulting in patients with similar identifiers. Typically, multiple-birth infants are distinguished from their siblings by a single character (1, 2, or A, B), placing them at higher risk for identification errors, which can delay care and compromise patient safety.\nWe present 2 unrelated cases involving naming errors in sets of infant twins receiving care in a healthcare system using Joint Commission compliant distinct temporary naming convention.\nIn the 2 cases, system failures contributed to naming errors in 2 sets of infant twins, which resulted in delayed care. In the first case, twins were inadvertently assigned the same temporary name. In the second case, an infant's blood specimen label did not include a single character, which distinguishes a multiple-birth infant from their sibling. Further safeguards are needed to reduce this risk. These cases illustrated the potential for misidentification related to newborn naming conventions during the registration process, especially between siblings of multiple-birth infants.\nFurther research is needed to determine strategies to prevent newborn identification errors. Potential strategies to reduce this risk and protect newborns include improving the design of newborn identifiers, systems-level interventions such as verification alerts, and improved registration processes.",

    "abstract": "Adverse prenatal conditions can exert a long-lasting impact in later life.\nThirty-eight post-pubertal monozygotic twin pairs (16 female pairs) with divergent birthweight (bw) due to twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome were examined at a median of 15.1 years. Auxological and endocrine parameters were measured. To evaluate effects of intra-twin bw and hormone differences on mental health, adolescents and their parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), identifying psychological problems. Twins answered the questionnaire on health-related quality of life (HrQoL, KIDSCREEN-52).\nParents attributed a higher number of psychological challenges to the formerly smaller twins, for example, total difficulties (8.8 vs. 6.5, p = 0.009). Differences in bw were associated with differences in parental evaluation of problems, for example, peer relationship problems (r = -0.57 and p = 0.0001). In contrast, bw differences did not affect subjects' self-assessment of psychological factors but on physical well-being (r = 0.42, p = 0.017). The formerly smaller discordant twins showed significantly lower HrQoL regarding psychological well-being (24.9 vs. 26.6, T1,15 = -2.2, and p = 0.043) and moods and emotions (29.8 vs. 32.0, T1,15 = -2.3, p = 0.039). Higher concentrations of androstenedione were linked to greater psychological well-being (r = 0.39 and p = 0.036) in all twin pairs.\nOur results show that the prenatal environment leading to bw differences exerts a long-lasting impact on diverging parental evaluation of mental health. Formerly smaller discordant twins showed significantly lower HrQoL regarding psychological well-being and moods and emotions. Higher androstenedione concentrations were linked to greater psychological well-being.",

The formerly smaller discordant twins showed significantly lower HrQoL regarding psychological well-being (24.9 vs. 26.6, T1,15 = -2.2, and p = 0.043) and moods and emotions (29.8 vs. 32.0, T1,15 = -2.3, p = 0.039). Higher concentrations of androstenedione were linked to greater psychological well-being (r = 0.39 and p = 0.036) in all twin pairs.",

    "abstract": "The '16Up' study conducted at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute from January 2014 to December 2018 aimed to examine the physical and mental health of young Australian twins aged 16-18 years (N = 876; 371 twin pairs and 18 triplet sets). Measurements included online questionnaires covering physical and mental health as well as information and communication technology (ICT) use, actigraphy, sleep diaries and hair samples to determine cortisol concentrations. Study participants generally rated themselves as being in good physical (79%) and mental (73%) health and reported lower rates of psychological distress and exposure to alcohol, tobacco products or other substances than previously reported for this age group in the Australian population. Daily or near-daily online activity was almost universal among study participants, with no differences noted between males and females in terms of frequency or duration of internet access. Patterns of ICT use in this sample indicated that the respondents were more likely to use online information sources for researching physical health issues than for mental health or substance use issues, and that they generally reported partial levels of satisfaction with the mental health information they found online. This suggests that internet-based mental health resources can be readily accessed by adolescent Australians, and their computer literacy augurs well for future access to online health resources. In combination with other data collected as part of the ongoing Brisbane Longitudinal Twin Study, the 16Up project provides a valuable resource for the longitudinal investigation of genetic and environmental contributions to phenotypic variation in a variety of human traits.",

    "abstract": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic lung disease that develops in low-birth-weight infants as a result of mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity in the early neonatal period. In these patients, mechanical ventilation and oxygen support are needed for a long time. We already use antenatal steroid, ventilation techniques with minimal baro/volutrauma, postnatal steroid, and vitamin A to prevent the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Mesenchymal stem cell treatment is another way to reduce or stop the pathophysiologic pathways in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Herein, we present mesenchymal stem cell treatment and its outcomes in twins who were born with a gestational age of 26 weeks and diagnosed as having bronchopulmonary dysplasia (the female twin was born with a birth weight of 750 g and the male twin was born with a birth weight of 930 g).

    "abstract": "Millions of people have been impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic worldwide. High infection rates and death tolls, combined with social distancing measures, may have unintended psychological consequences on individuals. The goal of this study was to examine the interrelations between COVID-19 exposure, fear of COVID-19, and depression among a community-based sample of adult twins. We further explored whether fear of COVID-19 mediated the association between COVID-19 exposure and depression. 732 same-sex adult twin pairs (78.1% MZ, 21.9% DZ) completed an online survey examining their feelings in May 2020. About one-fifth of the participants reported having any COVID-19 exposure. Most participants (>80%) were somewhat concerned about themselves or their household members being infected by COVID-19. The average depression level was relatively low (M\u00a0=\u00a00.9 out of 6). We found that COVID-19 exposure was related to increased fears of COVID-19 and depression, and that depressive feelings increased with fear of COVID-19. The correlation between COVID-19 exposure and depression was partially mediated by fear of COVID-19. However, these associations were confounded by familial influences. As society navigates through the pandemic, it is essential to implement public health strategies to help individuals cope with the concerns and fears about COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "3D-inkjet-printing is just beginning to take off in the optical field. Advantages of this technique include its fast and cost-efficient fabrication without tooling costs. However, there are still obstacles preventing 3D inkjet-printing from a broad usage in optics, e.g., insufficient form fidelity. In this article, we present the formulation of a digital twin by the enhancement of an optical model by integrating geometrical measurement data. This approach strengthens the high-precision 3D printing process to fulfil optical precision requirements. A process flow between the design of freeform components, fabrication by inkjet printing, the geometrical measurement of the fabricated optical surface, and the feedback of the measurement data into the simulation model was developed, and its interfaces were defined. The evaluation of the measurements allowed for the adaptation of the printing process to compensate for process errors and tolerances. Furthermore, the performance of the manufactured component was simulated and compared with the nominal performance, and the enhanced model could be used for sensitivity analysis. The method was applied to a highly complex helical surface that allowed for the adjustment of the optical power by rotation. We show that sensitivity analysis could be used to define acceptable tolerance budgets of the process.",

    "abstract": "Few studies are available on birth asphyxia risks in twin neonates. This retrospective multi-center cross-sectional study determined the birthweight percentiles of 5337twins and birth asphyxia incidence of the twin population.\nWe retrieved sociodemographic and obstetric data from the electronic records systems of participating centers. Neonate birthweight was measured within 24 h of birth. Perinatal asphyxia was diagnosed if 5-minute Apgar score was \u22645, or resuscitation was required 10 min after birth. The primary outcome was the incidence of birth asphyxia.\nTotally 5337 neonates were eligible. The mean neonatal birthweight was 2227.1 \u00b1 608.99 g and the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of birthweight were 970, 2400, and 3080 g, respectively. The mean Apgar score was 9.06 \u00b1 1.73 at 1 min and 8.99 \u00b1 1.74 at 5 min. Totally 13.5 % (705/5222) twins had asphyxia and 9.35 % and 4.16 % twins had moderate and severe asphyxia, respectively. Twins with a birthweight< 1500 g had the highest asphyxia rate (64.8 %) and twins with a birthweight between 2500 and 3000 g had the lowest asphyxia rate (3.6 %). Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that higher birthweight was associated with a significantly reduced risk of asphyxia [OR 0.772 (95 %CI 0.755, 0.789), P < 0.001]. The AUROC for mean twin birthweight was 0.86\u00b10.01 (95 %CI 0.84, 0.88) using a cutoff of 1950 g, with a sensitivity of 0.84 and a specificity of 0.78.\nTwins have lower birthweight versus singletons and a significant proportion of twins, especially twins with lower birthweight, are at risk of birth asphyxia. Birthweight is an independent predictor of asphyxia and should be further explored as a predictive marker for stratifying asphyxia risks in twin neonates.",

    "abstract": "Unilateral condylar hyperplasia (UCH) is an abnormal growth process that results in the development of mandibular asymmetry. The aetiopathogenesis of this entity is still unclear. Various factors including hormonal influences, intrauterine factors, trauma, infection, and genetics have been speculated to lead to the development of UCH. In genetic epidemiology, twins have been a valuable resource for investigating the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases. We present a case of mirror-image UCH in a pair of monozygotic twins, providing evidence of a possible genetic link for this mandibular growth disorder. The concordance in the monozygotic twins appears to be reflected by the precise mirror-image presentation of the congenital dentofacial anomalies. Further twin studies would be useful in clarifying the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to the presence and development of UCH.",

    "abstract": "Combined immunodeficiencies (CIDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by various gene mutations. The mutations in the STK4 (Serine Threonine Kinase 4) gene, which has a role in the regulation of apoptosis and proliferation, can be a cause of immunodeficiency. In the current paper, we reported a case of identical twin brothers with a novel STK4 mutation, one of whom showed clinical manifestations associated with this mutation with a delay of two years. The mutation in the STK4 gene was identified employing Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), and we described the probable reasons for this delay. We found that the STK4 genetic defect caused almost the same clinical symptoms of immunodeficiency in the twin brothers. Meanwhile, the severity of the disease was higher in one of them, which may be due to extra genetic defect in LRBA, and likely differences in the percentage of B lymphocyte population and CD4+/ CD8+ state.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) are used to summarize hospital morbidity and mortality. Each DRG has a weight which is important in calculating the case mix index (CMI), a numeric summary of disease complexity in a population of patients. We utilized DRG weight and resultant CMI to compare postnatal outcomes among singletons versus monochorionic and monoamniotic, monochorionic diamniotic, and dichorionic diamniotic twins.\nThis single-center and retrospective cohort study evaluated DRGs assigned by the investigators, birth weight, gestational age, length of stay (LOS), NICU admission rate, and mortality in twin births between 2014 and 2016. Twins were analyzed depending on chorionicity and amnionicity. Overall, 3 months of singleton births served as the control. The CMI derived from DRG weights were compared across groups.\nTwins (\nDRG weight and CMI values summarize in-hospital complexity and can be a useful tool to evaluate differences in care complexity among groups of patients.\n\u00b7 Using diagnosis-related group and case mix index to assess morbidities.. \u00b7 Morbidities of twins are monochorionic-monoamniotic versus monochorionic-diamniotic versus dichorionic-diamniotic twins.. \u00b7 Only seven diagnosis-related group in neonatology make it a valuable tool for clinicians..",

    "abstract": "While previous research has investigated neuroradiological findings in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the entire range of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) has not yet been well-studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Considering the overlap among NDDs and simultaneous development of the brain and face, guided by molecular signaling, we examined the relationship of actionable and incidental (non-actionable) MRI findings and NDD diagnoses together with facial morphological variants and genetic copy number variants (CNVs). A cross-sectional study was conducted with a twin cohort 8-36\u00a0years of age (57% monozygotic, 40% dizygotic), including 372 subjects (46% with NDDs; 47% female) imaged by MRI, 280 with data for facial morphological variants, and 183 for CNVs. Fifty-one percent of participants had MRI findings. Males had a statistically significantly higher percentage of MRI findings (57.7%) compared with females (43.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.03). Twin zygosity was not statistically significantly correlated with incidence or severity of specific MRI findings. No statistically significant association was found between MRI findings and any NDD diagnosis or facial morphological variants; however, MRI findings were statistically significantly associated with the number of CNVs (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.00-1.44, p\u2009=\u20090.05, adjusted OR for sex 1.24, 95% CI 1.03-1.50, p\u2009=\u20090.02). When combining the presence of MRI findings, facial morphological variants, and CNVs, statistically significant relationships were found with ASD and ADHD diagnoses (p\u2009=\u20090.0006 and p\u2009=\u20090.002, respectively). The results of this study demonstrate that the ability to identify NDDs from combined radiology, morphology, and CNV assessments may be possible. Additionally, twins do not appear to be at increased risk for neuroradiological variants.",

Early detection of the disease is, therefore, very important. Despite the fact that leukemia in twins occurs rarely, more attention has been paid to it in genetic studies. In the present study, through cytogenetic testing, a special case of concordant ALL in monozygotic twins was presented with different outcomes. In spite of an acceptable initial consequence to medical treatment in twins, in another brother (Twin B), early relapse was observed. In the cytogenetic study, both twins expressed ",

    "abstract": "Although the use of 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate is one of the most commonly used strategies to reduce the risk of preterm birth since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, there has been controversy recently that there may be no benefit associated with its use in singleton pregnancies in women with a prior history of spontaneous preterm birth. However, very few of these investigations evaluated the use of intramuscular progesterone in twin pregnancies. A few studies that used 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in twin pregnancies had mainly included unselected twin pregnancies. Although a twin pregnancy is independently associated with an increased likelihood of preterm birth, the primary indication for the use of supplemental progesterone in pregnancy is prior history of spontaneous preterm birth. Therefore, our investigation of weekly intramuscular progesterone in twin pregnancies with this birth history best addresses this question using a selected cohort.\nTo assess whether weekly 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate prevents recurrent preterm birth in women with a current twin pregnancy and a prior singleton spontaneous preterm birth.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of women with twin pregnancy and a prior singleton spontaneous preterm birth in 2 institutions between January 2005 and December 2016. One group (intervention group) consisted of women who received weekly 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, whereas the other (control group) did not. The primary outcome was twin spontaneous preterm birth <34 weeks compared with odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio, adjusting for potential confounders. Secondary outcomes included composite neonatal morbidity such as respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, admission to the neonatal intensive care nursery, and fetal or neonatal death before hospital discharge.\nA total of 79 patients were included; 27 women received weekly 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate and 52 did not. There were no statistically significant differences in maternal demographics except for age. Spontaneous preterm birth <34 weeks occurred in 16 patients (59%) in the intervention group vs 24 (46%) in the control group (odds ratio, 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-4.54). Composite neonatal morbidity occurred in 20 pregnancies (74%) in the intervention group and 41 pregnancies (79%) in the control group (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-2.12). There remained no differences in outcomes after adjusting for potential confounders.\nIn our study, weekly 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate did not prevent spontaneous preterm birth or neonatal morbidity in women with twins and a prior singleton spontaneous preterm birth; however, further research with larger numbers and prospective design is needed.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypically discordant monozygotic twins (PDMZTs) offer a unique opportunity to study post-zygotic genetic variation and provide insights into the linkage between genotype and phenotype. We report a comprehensive analysis of a pair of PDMZTs.\nDysmorphic features and delayed neuro-motor development were observed in the proband, whereas her twin sister was phenotypically normal. Four tissues (blood, skin, hair follicles, and buccal mucosa) from both twins were studied using four complementary methods, including whole-exome sequencing, karyotyping, array CGH, and SNP array.\nIn the proband, tetrasomy 18p affecting all studied tissues except for blood was identified. Karyotyping of fibroblasts revealed isochromosome 18p [i(18p)] in all metaphases. The corresponding analysis of the phenotypically normal sister surprisingly revealed low-level mosaicism (5.4%) for i(18p) in fibroblasts.\nWe emphasize that when mosaicism is suspected, multiple tissues should be studied and we highlight the usefulness of non-invasive sampling of hair follicles and buccal mucosa as a convenient source of non-mesoderm-derived DNA, which complements the analysis of mesoderm using blood. Moreover, low-level mosaic tetrasomy 18p is well tolerated and such low-level mosaicism, readily detected by karyotyping, can be missed by other methods. Finally, mosaicism for low-level tetrasomy 18p might be more common in the general population than it is currently recognized, due to detection limitations.",

    "conclusions": "We emphasize that when mosaicism is suspected, multiple tissues should be studied and we highlight the usefulness of non-invasive sampling of hair follicles and buccal mucosa as a convenient source of non-mesoderm-derived DNA, which complements the analysis of mesoderm using blood. Moreover, low-level mosaic tetrasomy 18p is well tolerated and such low-level mosaicism, readily detected by karyotyping, can be missed by other methods. Finally, mosaicism for low-level tetrasomy 18p might be more common in the general population than it is currently recognized, due to detection limitations.",

    "abstract": "May-Hegglin anomaly is an autosomal dominant inherited condition, characterized by thrombocytopenia, giant platelets and Dohle-like bodies. Incidence is unknown and affected individuals can show from mild to moderate-severe haemorrhagic symptoms. The cyst of cavum veli interpositi (a virtual space filled with fluid within the third ventricle) is rarely reported in the foetal period. Furthermore, it is unclear whether isolated cavum veli interpositi cysts are a normal variant or developmental malformations. The simultaneous presence of these two anomalies was never described.\nWe describe a very rare case of a twin monochorionic pregnancy in a woman with the May-Hegglin anomaly, whose foetuses carried cavum veli interpositi cysts. Since childhood, our patient had shown macro-thrombocytopenia, deafness and bleeding (epistaxis and menorrhagia), but she was misdiagnosed until the age of 30\u2009years when our Centre identified a de novo allelic variant in the gene MYH9 coding for the non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIa. Our patient bled neither during the pregnancy, nor in the peripartum period. Children are now eight-months-old and have never bled, although both inherited the MYH9 variant and have thrombocytopenia with giant platelets. Furthermore, none of them developed psychomotor disorders.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the sixth case of twin pregnancy in a woman carrying May-Hegglin anomaly and the first one with cavum veli interpositi cysts in the neonates. We speculate that MYH9 could have, at least in part, played a role in the development of both conditions, as this gene has a pleiotropic effect.",

    "abstract": "One of the controversies in the management of twin gestations relates to mode of delivery, especially when the second twin is in a nonvertex presentation (Vertex/nonVertex pairs) and birth is imminent at extremely low gestation.\nWe hypothesized that, for Vertex/nonVertex twins born before 28 weeks' gestation, cesarean delivery would be associated with a lower risk of adverse neonatal outcomes than trial of vaginal delivery. Our aim was to test this hypothesis by comparing the neonatal outcomes of Vertex/nonVertex twins born before 28 weeks' gestation by mode of delivery using a large national cohort.\nThis work is a retrospective cohort study of all twin infants born at 24\nA total of 1082 twin infants (541 twin pairs) met the inclusion criteria: 220 Vertex/nonVertex pairs, of which 112 had a trial of vaginal delivery (study group) and 108 had cesarean delivery for both twins (control group 1); 170 pairs with the first twin in nonvertex presentation, all of which were born by cesarean delivery (control group 2); and 151 pairs with both twins in vertex presentation (vertex or nonvertex). In the study group, the rate of urgent cesarean delivery for the second twin was 30%. The rate of the primary outcome in the study group was 42%, which was not significantly different compared with control group 1 (37%; adjusted relative risk, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-1.22) or control group 2 (34%; adjusted relative risk, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.58). The findings remained similar when outcomes were analyzed separately for the first and second twins.\nFor preterm Vertex/nonVertex twins born at <28 weeks' gestation, we found no difference in the risk of adverse neonatal outcome between a trial of vaginal delivery and primary cesarean delivery. However, a trial of vaginal delivery was associated with a high rate of urgent cesarean delivery for the second twin.",

    "abstract": "To delineate the blood group for a pair of twins with inconclusive ABO blood typing result.\nSerological test for blood group was carried out by using ABO and Rh Blood Grouping Cards (Microcolumn Gel Immunoassay). Sequence specific primer-PCR (PCR-SSP), direct sequencing and TA clone sequencing were used to analyze the ABO gene. Genetic status was analyzed by using 16 short tandem repeat (STR) markers.\nRed blood cells of the twins displayed 2+ mixed agglutination phenomenon with anti-A, anti-A1 and anti-E. PCR-SSP and DNA sequencing of exons 6 to 7 revealed that they have an ABO*O.01.01/ABO*O.01.02 genotype. DNA sequencing of microsatellite enhancer region revealed presence of A gene. STR analysis revealed more than two haplotypes for 9 loci between the twins. After clustered by anti-A, the red blood cells were divided into two groups: A, CcDEe and O, CcDee, respectively.\nSerological and molecular techniques have characterized the twins as blood group chimeras.",

    "abstract": "In this study, to address the problems of multiple dimensions, large scales, complex tension resource scheduling, and strict quality control requirements in the tensioning process of cables in prestressed steel structures, the technical characteristics of digital twins (DTs) and artificial intelligence (AI) are analyzed. An intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables method driven by the integration of DTs and AI is proposed. Based on the current research status of cable tensioning and DTs, combined with the goal of intelligent tensioning, a fusion mechanism for DTs and AI is established and their integration to drive intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables technology is analyzed. In addition, the key issues involved in the construction of an intelligent control center driven by the integration of DTs and AI are discussed. By considering the construction elements of space and time dimensions, the tensioning process is controlled at multiple levels, thereby realizing the intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables. Driven by intelligent tensioning methods, the safety performance evaluation of the intelligent tensioning process is analyzed. Combined with sensing equipment and intelligent algorithms, a high-fidelity twin model and three-dimensional integrated data model are constructed to realize closed-loop control of the intelligent tensioning safety evaluation. Through the study of digital twins and artificial intelligence fusion to drive the intelligent tensioning method for prestressed cables, this study focuses on the analysis of the intelligent evaluation of safety performance. This study provides a reference for fusion applications with DTs and AI in intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables.",

    "abstract": "Few factor analyses and no network analyses have examined the structure of DSM phobic fears or tested the specificity of the relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobic fears.\nHistories of 21 lifetime phobic fears, coded as four-level ordinal variables (no fear to fear with major interference) were assessed at personal interview in 7514 adults from the Virginia Twin Registry. We estimated Gaussian Graphical Models on individual phobic fears; compared network structures of women and men using the Network Comparison Test; used community detection to determine the number and nature of groups in which phobic fears hang together; and validated the anticipated specific relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobia.\nAll networks were densely and positively inter-connected; networks of women and men were structurally similar. Our most frequent and stable solution identified four phobic clusters: (i) blood-injection, (ii) social-agoraphobia, (iii) situational, and (iv) animal-disease. Fear of public restrooms and of diseases clustered with animal and not, respectively, social and blood-injury phobias. When added to the network, the three strongest connections with lifetime panic disorder were all agoraphobic fears: being in crowds, going out of the house alone, and being in open spaces.\nUsing network analyses applied to a large epidemiologic twin sample, we broadly validated the DSM-IV typography but did not entirely support the distinction of agoraphobic and social phobic fears or the DSM placements for fears of public restrooms and diseases. We found strong support for the specificity of the relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobic fears.",

Conjoined twins are classified according to their symmetry, place of fusion, and grade of duplication.\nWe report here an extremely rare presentation of parasitic twins not described before. We describe macro and micro anatomic alterations and discuss the aspects of this peculiar presentation and the importance of prenatal diagnosis.\nThe case of a twenty-three-year-old patient, with monochorionic, monoamniotic asymmetrically-conjoined twin pregnancy, discovered at 29 weeks of gestational age. We believe that this report calls attention to this presentation and the importance of prenatal care and management. The twins were delivered vaginally without life. The twins' combined weight was 1.300 gr. They were bonded in the left cervical region.\nThis report may help to find strategies for clinical decisions in future cases. Antepartum diagnosis is important to the management, preoperative planning, and outcomes. Prenatal imaging exams like echocardiography, CT, MRI, and ultrasonography are feasible and can provide relevant information about malformation severity and prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Data on differences in brain features between monozygotic (MZ) twins with and without schizophrenia are scarce.\nWe compared brain features of female MZ twins with and without first-episode schizophrenia and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a020 each). Voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics were used to analyze differences in brain structure. Whole-brain effective connectivity (EC) and functional connectivity (FC) networks were constructed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data.\nFemale twins with schizophrenia exhibited abnormal gray matter volume (GMV) in the basal ganglia and prefrontal and parietal cortices, impairments in the arcuate fasciculus, and significant disruptions (primarily decreases) in nine EC networks. They exhibited rs-EC alterations involving the limbic areas and subcortex. Combined rs-EC and rs-FC data distinguished twins with first-episode schizophrenia with high accuracy. Combined consideration of structural and functional features enabled the distinction of female MZ twins with schizophrenia from those without schizophrenia and healthy controls with 100% accuracy.\nFemale MZ twins with schizophrenia exhibited increased GMV, white matter impairment, and disruptions in EC and FC networks. The combination of rs-EC\u00a0+\u00a0rs-FC data could distinguish female twins with schizophrenia from twins without schizophrenia and healthy controls with 97.4% accuracy, and the addition of structural brain features yielded a 100% accuracy rate. These findings may provide pivotal insight for further study of the mechanisms underlying schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Placental passage of drugs in twins is poorly understood, and is unknown regarding antiretrovirals (ARVs). In the event of large differences in the exposure of 2 twins to the same maternal therapy, this could have a clinical impact in terms of prevention of perinatal HIV transmission or adverse effects.\nTo describe the frequency of differential transplacental passage of antiretrovirals between twins.\nThe study was performed retrospectively, on data from women included in a multicenter perinatal HIV cohort study. All twin pairs for which the mother received antiretroviral therapy and for which drug concentrations in both of the umbilical cords after cord clamping at delivery were studied. We considered that a difference in concentrations of more than 50 % between twins was a substantial difference (ratios below 0.67 or above 1.50).\nWe analyzed 29 twin pairs, 27 dichorionic and 2 monochorionic diamniotic. Cord blood concentrations differed between the 2 twins by more than 50 % for at least one ARV in 9 twin pairs, 8 dichorionic and 1 monochorionic. Discordant concentrations were observed in one or more cases for several nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tenofovir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, zidovudine) and protease inhibitors (atazanavir, lopinavir, saquinavir et ritonavir); within individual twin pairs placental transfer was discordant for one or more ARVs, but identical for others.\nConcentrations differed in nearly one third of twin pairs. This may be due to interindividual genetic variability of placental transporters between dizygotic twins as well as physiological differences between twins.",

    "abstract": "The surgical separation of two Conjoined Twins is a particularly complex operation. Surgical times are particularly long and post-operative complications are very frequent in this type of procedure. We report a clinical case of surgical separation of two thoraco-omphalopagus conjoined twins in which, thanks to the use of (3D) three dimensional technologies, we were able to significantly reduce operative times and improve clinical outcomes.\nWe performed a 3D reconstruction of the anatomical parts involved in congenital fusion using Computer Tomography (CT) images.We obtained virtual anatomical models of the patients which allowed us to estimate essential details as the residual post-operative thoracic volume as well as the exact position of resection planes for both the general separation and for the hepatic splitting procedure. Subsequently, we printed 3D anatomical models of the thoracic cage and sternum and of the liver with the plane of resection. Finally, we printed an additional 3D anatomical model of the two patients representing different organs with multiple colors and materials.\nThe use of 3D printing reduced the duration of surgery by 30% with a favorable patient outcome. Two years after the operation, the patients do not present any type of deficit and have a normal life without any significant complication.\nVirtual anatomical 3D models and 3D printing represent a valid technological tool to support complex surgical operations, especially in pre-surgical planning. 3D models are important tools to better understand complex anatomy and to discuss clinical cases among members of the surgical team.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common birth defect in human with an incidence of almost 1% of all live births. Most cases have a multifactorial origin with both genetics and the environment playing a role in its development and progression. Adding an epigenetic component to this aspect is exemplified by monozygotic twins which share the same genetic background but have a different disease status. As a result, the interplay between the genetic, epigenetic and the environmental conditions might contribute to the etiology and phenotype. To date, the underlying causes of the majority of CHDs remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed genome-wide high-throughput sequencing to examine the genetic, structural genomic and epigenetic differences of two identical twin pairs discordant for Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), representing the most common cyanotic form of CHDs. Our results show the almost identical genetic and structural genomic identity of the twins. In contrast, several epigenetic alterations could be observed given by DNA methylation changes in regulatory regions of known cardiac-relevant genes. Overall, this study provides first insights into the impact of genetic and especially epigenetic factors underlying monozygotic twins discordant for CHD like TOF.",

    "abstract": "Heteropaternal superfecundation is an extremely rare phenomenon that occurs when a second ova released during the same menstrual cycle is additionally fertilized by the sperm cells of a different man in separate sexual intercourse. In August, 2018, the Grupo de Gen\u00e9tica de Poblaciones e Identificaci\u00f3n at Universidad Nacional de Colombia received a request to establish the paternity of a pair of male twins with genetic markers. The following analyses were performed: amelogenin gene, autosomal short tandem repeat (STR), and Y-STR analyses by means of human identification commercial kits, paternity index, and the probability of paternity calculation and interpretation. A paternity index of 2.5134E+7 and a probability of paternity of 99.9999% for twin 2 were obtained while 14 out of 17 Y-chromosome markers and 14 out of 21 autosomal short tandem repeats were excluded for twin 1. The results indicated that the twins have different biological fathers. Although heteropaternal superfecundation is rarely observed among humans given its low frequency, in paternity disputes for dizygotic twins it is mandatory to demand the presence of the two twins in the testing to avoid wrong conclusions.\nLa superfecundaci\u00f3n heteropaternal es un fen\u00f3meno extremadamente raro que se produce cuando un segundo \u00f3vulo, liberado durante el mismo ciclo menstrual, es fertilizado por un espermatozoide de un hombre diferente en relaciones sexuales separadas.

Se obtuvo un \u00edndice de paternidad de 2,5134E+7 y una probabilidad de paternidad de 99,9999 % para el gemelo 2, en tanto que en el gemelo 1 se excluyeron 14 de los 17 marcadores del cromosoma Y y 14 de los 21 sistemas STR autos\u00f3micos evaluados. Los resultados indicaron que los gemelos tienen diferentes padres biol\u00f3gicos. A pesar de que la superfecundaci\u00f3n heteropaternal rara vez se observa en humanos debido a su baja frecuencia, en las disputas de paternidad para los gemelos dicig\u00f3ticos, es obligatorio exigir en la prueba la presencia de los dos gemelos para evitar conclusiones incorrectas.\nLa superfecundaci\u00f3n heteropaternal es un fen\u00f3meno extremadamente raro que se produce cuando un segundo \u00f3vulo, liberado durante el mismo ciclo menstrual, es fertilizado por un espermatozoide de un hombre diferente en relaciones sexuales separadas.

    "abstract": "The article represents clinical and pathoanatomical analysis of a case of full-term pregnancy with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) in one of the twins, which occurred using in vitro fertilization (IVF). The dead macerated fetus with malformations after selective feticide at the 20th week of pregnancy and dichorial diamniotic placenta were studied. In connection with the expressive autolytic changes in the internal organs of the fetus, which do not allow to confirm the diagnosis of left ventricular hypoplasia at autopsy and establish its type of structure, additional measurements of the heart structures of the fetus with HLHS on archived video materials of ultrasound diagnostics were performed. After calculating the diagnostic indices: the index of myocardial layer thickness (ratio of the thicknesses of the trabecular and compact myocardium), the index of cavity shape of the heart in frontal axis (ratio of width to cavity length), cavity-myocardial index (ratio of wall thickness to cavity width), the cylindrical LV structure was retrospectively determined, which is prognostically unfavorable any kind of surgical correction, which justified selective feticide. The article presents the values of diagnostic indices for identifying the types of structure of hypoplastic LV. Prenatal determination of LV type determines treatment tactics: terminate pregnancy in case of adverse LV types, recommend Norwood procedure in the neonatal period with type I or perform fetal aortic valvuloplasty with type II of LV. The maturation disorders (distal villous hypoplasia) that we found in the placenta of a living fetus confirms that, despite the relatively satisfactory condition of the newborn, pregnancies that occur with the use of IVF are high risk group of developmental disability both the fetus and placenta.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare occurrence, and the majority of these malformations are detected during second trimester screening.\nHerein we report a case of conjoined twins, which was diagnosed by ultrasound at 8 wk gestation and was normal at 7 wk gestation. The two fetuses shared one heart and were diagnosed as thoracopagus twins. This is the first report of conjoined twins diagnosed at 8 wk gestation. The pregnancy was terminated electively at 9 wk gestation. Because some congenital malformations can be diagnosed earlier, a prenatal ultrasound examination at an early gestational stage cannot be dismissed.\nThis case demonstrates that a 7-8 wk gestation might be the earliest period when conjoined twins can be diagnosed by ultrasound.",

    "abstract": "Despite folate supplementation, neural tube defects (NTDs) still occur in 0.5-1.0/1,000 pregnancies, with 30-50% not preventable with folate. Twinning has increased due to artificial fertilization and in itself predisposes to NTDs at a rate of 1.6/1,000. The contributions of genetic and environmental factors to myelomeningocele development remain poorly understood. Expression patterns of congenital pathologies in twins can sometimes provide etiological insight. Concordance of NTDs in twins is 0.03/1,000, with dual myelomeningocele reported in only 23 pairs, only one of which survived. We present the 24th pair, the 1st to maintain lower extremity motor function. We review all prior cases and discuss implications of twin concordance on the interplay of genetic and environmental influences. Case Report and Review: A new case of female monozygotic twins born to a well-nourished 24-year-old female is reported with details of perioperative care. Prenatal ultrasound showed L3-S4 and L5-S4 myelomeningoceles, Chiari II malformations, and ventriculomegaly. Copy number microarray was unrevealing. Each underwent uncomplicated repair on day of life 1, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement on days of life 10 and 16. Both had movement in the legs upon 6-week follow-up. All prior reported cases of concordant twin myelomeningoceles were abstracted and analyzed, revealing persistence of occurrence despite folate supplementation and a majority occurring in dizygotic pairs. The literature is also reviewed to summarize current knowledge of myelomeningocele pathophysiology as it relates to genetic and environmental influences.\nMeticulous surgical and perioperative care allowed for early positive outcomes in each twin. However, etiopathogenesis remains elusive. In general, only of a minority of cases have underlying genetic lesions or clear environmental triggers. Concordance in monozygotic twins argues for a strong genetic influence; yet, literature review reveals a higher rate of concordant dizygotic twins. This, along with the observation of differing resultant phenotypes in monozygotic twins as seen in this case, prompts further investigation into nonfolate environmental influences. While efforts in genetic investigation should continue, the role of teratogens and exposures should not be minimized in research efforts, public health, and family counseling. Clinical genetic testing remains of limited utility in the majority of patients until more is known.",

    "abstract": "Kenny-Caffey syndrome (KCS) type 2 (OMIM 127000) is a rare syndromic cause of hypoparathyroidism which is characterized by proportionate short stature, long bone abnormalities, delayed closure of anterior fontanelle, eye abnormalities, and normal intelligence. It is caused by variants in FAM111A (NM_001942519.1). In this review, we reported the first Chinese patients, a pair of monozygotic twins, with genetically confirmed KCS type 2 with over 20\u2009years follow-up. We summarized the clinical features of 14 previously reported and genetically confirmed KCS type 2 patients; our twin patients exhibited a unique spinal manifestation which could be an important age-dependent feature of KCS type 2. In this review, over 60% KCS type 2 patients had dental problem and over 80% suffered from refractive errors or structural eye abnormalities. Therefore, early dental, ophthalmological, and orthopedic assessments are warranted for KCS type 2 patients. Micro-orchidism, previously reported in KCS type 2 patients, was also detected in our patients. The possibility of subfertility should be considered in male KCS type 2 patients. A multidisciplinary management approach for this rare syndrome is recommended.",

    "abstract": "In vitro fertilization (IVF) is associated with a higher incidence of monozygotic twin pregnancies, which are known to be burdened by a higher risk of main obstetric complications. The reasons behind this association are still unclear. In the present study, we therefore investigate the risk factors for monozygotic twinning in pregnancies achieved by IVF. We conducted a multicenter retrospective case-control study. All IVF cycles performed between 2014 and 2019 at the infertility units of two Italian academic institutes were retrospectively reviewed. Only pregnancies obtained with single embryo transfer were eligible. A total of 50 monozygotic twin pregnancies (cases) were identified and matched in a 1:5 ratio to 250 singleton pregnancies (controls) by study center and study period. Monozygotic twin pregnancies were diagnosed by ultrasound. Women experiencing miscarriage could be included provided that the pregnancy loss occurred after a definitive diagnosis of monozygotic twin pregnancy. Demographic, clinical, and embryological characteristics were retrieved from patients' charts. Overall, the incidence of monozygotic twin pregnancies was 1.2% (50 out of 4016 single embryo transfers). At univariate analyses, statistically significant differences emerged for BMI, peripheral levels of estradiol and progesterone at the time of hCG administration, total number of retrieved suitable oocytes, freezing-thawing cycles, and assisted hatching. After performing a multivariate logistic analysis, only assisted hatching remained significantly associated with monozygotic twinning (adjusted odds ratio 2.32, 95%CI 1.03-5.25). Blastomere separation during the passage through this artificial hole or interference with the signaling pathway within the embryo could be the mechanisms involved.",

    "abstract": "A high birth weight discordance (BWD) places twins at high risks of adverse perinatal outcomes; however, there is no commonly accepted definition of intertwin BWD. Given that gestational age (GA) is closely associated with both BWD and adverse neonatal outcomes, the aim of our study is to develop a measure that takes both BWD and GA into account to define BWD and explore the potentially optimal delivery time in dichorionic twins, with the balance against the risk of intrauterine demise and adverse neonatal outcomes.\nAbout 99,000 mixed gender twin pairs from the US matched multiple birth file from 1995 to 2000 were enrolled in our study. We set up a two-dimensional matrix model to select the BWD cutoff point related to outcomes. The optimal delivery time was identified based on the risks of adverse neonatal outcomes and fetal death by GA.\nThe combination of BWD and GA had a higher predictive performance for adverse neonatal outcomes than BWD alone (area under ROC curve (AUC): 0.816 vs. 0.523, \nThe combination of BWD and GA was a better predictor for adverse neonatal outcomes than BWD alone. In dichorionic twins with BWD >40%, pregnancy may be continued till 33-34 gestation weeks if there is no indication for immediate delivery.",

Literature regarding neonatal airway management after conjoined twin delivery is limited to case reports. We present a case series of conjoined twins and introduce an airway management protocol for conjoined twin delivery.\nThe medical records of conjoined twins and their mothers at a tertiary care center were reviewed from April 2016 to December 2018. The NCBI database was queried for literature regarding preparation for neonatal airway management after conjoined twins delivery.\nFive sets of conjoined twins were delivered. Of 10 neonates, all required bag valve mask ventilation. Other airway interventions included continuous positive airway pressure (7), endotracheal intubation (6), and direct laryngoscopy with telescopic video evaluation (1). No patients required ex-utero intrapartum treatment or emergent tracheostomy. A protocol for airway management is described and special considerations are discussed, including anatomic variations, equipment list, operating room staffing and layout, multidisciplinary prenatal conference, and airway imaging review.\nConjoined twin deliveries have significant implications for the otolaryngologist and require multidisciplinary collaboration. An airway management protocol allows for a standardized process to secure the neonatal airway and optimize patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "While cervical length (CL) provides an effective screening tool for spontaneous preterm birth in singletons, the performance in twins is still controversial. Our aim was twofold. First, to compare the performance of a single CL measurement at mid-gestation (\u223c20\u2009weeks) versus serial measurements as a predictor of spontaneous preterm birth < 34\u2009weeks in uncomplicated twin pregnancies. Second, to describe the performance of a single CL at \u223c24, \u223c28 and \u223c32\u2009weeks.\ncohort study of twins followed at Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires from 2013 to 2017. Inclusion criteria were dichorionic or monochorionic diamniotic twins with CL measurement between 18 and 33\u2009+\u20096\u2009weeks with available data of the delivery. Exclusion criteria included any of the following complications: iatrogenic preterm delivery <34\u2009weeks, cerclage, fetal growth restriction, fetal death, structural anomalies, polyhydramnios, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, selective fetal growth restriction, twin anemia-polycythemia sequence, and twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence. Spontaneous preterm birth was defined as spontaneous delivery < 34\u2009weeks. Two different cutoffs were used to classify CL as short (positive screening) or normal (negative screening): (a) a fixed cutoff of 25\u2009mm at any gestational age (GA). The screening was considered positive if any CL measurement was <25\u2009mm; and (b) a GA adjusted cutoff to a 10% false positive rate (FPR). The 10% FPR for each GA was calculated and the screening was considered positive if any of the CL measurements were below this 10% FPR cutoff. We report sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, positive and negative likelihood ratio and area under the ROC curve.\nAmong 777 twins followed in our Unit, 381 met exclusion criteria and 18 were excluded due to incomplete follow-up. We included 378 patients, 284 (75%) dichorionic and 94 (25%) monochorionic. The performance of one CL at 20\u2009weeks showed a sensitivity \u2264 20% with an area under the ROC curve of 0.58 (95% CI, 0.45-0.70), while the performance of serial measurements showed a sensitivity of 58.8% (95% CI, 40.7-75.4) with an area under the ROC curve of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.61-0.79) (\nSerial measurements showed a better performance than a single one in mid-gestation. Moreover, among single measurements the CL in mid-gestation showed the poorest performance, while the 28\u2009weeks assessment detected half of the preterm deliveries. However, all the strategies showed modest performances.",

    "abstract": "Despite a strong genetic background in cognitive function only a limited number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We hypothesize that this is partially due to mis-specified modeling concerning phenotype distribution as well as the relationship between SNP dosage and the level of the phenotype. To overcome these issues, we introduced an assumption-free method based on generalized correlation coefficient (GCC) in a GWAS of cognitive function in Danish and Chinese twins to compare its performance with traditional linear models. The GCC-based GWAS identified two significant SNPs in Danish samples (rs71419535, p ",

    "abstract": "We present prenatal diagnosis and management of monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for severe fetal abnormalities.\nA 36-year-old woman underwent amniocentesis at 18 weeks of gestation because of advanced maternal age, and hydrops fetalis, a giant cystic hygroma of 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.5\u00a0cm and left hydronephrosis in a co-twin. The other co-twin was structurally normal. Amniocentesis revealed a karyotype of 46,XY in both co-twins. Simultaneous polymorphic DNA marker analysis using the DNAs extracted from maternal blood and uncultured amniocytes confirmed MZ twinning. The woman underwent a successful selective fetal reduction by radiofrequency ablation at 22 weeks of gestation. At 28 weeks of gestation, premature rupture of membranes occurred, and a 1280-g normal male baby and a 275-g dead malformed co-twin were delivered. The normal co-twin was phenotypically normal and was doing well at age seven weeks.\nPrenatal diagnosis of MZ twins discordant for structural abnormalities should include a differential diagnosis of MZ twinning, and a zygosity test is necessary under such a circumstance.",

    "abstract": "Twins have an increased risk for congenital malformations and disruptions, including defects in brain morphogenesis. We analyzed data on brain imaging, zygosity, sex, and fetal demise in 56 proband twins and 7 less affected co-twins with abnormal brain imaging and compared them to population-based data and to a literature series. We separated our series into malformations of cortical development (MCD, N\u00a0=\u200939), cerebellar malformations without MCD (N\u00a0=\u200913), and brain disruptions (N\u00a0=\u200911). The MCD group included 37/39 (95%) with polymicrogyria (PMG), 8/39 (21%) with pia-ependymal clefts (schizencephaly), and 15/39 (38%) with periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) including 2 with PNH but not PMG. Cerebellar malformations were found in 19 individuals including 13 with a cerebellar malformation only and another 6 with cerebellar malformation and MCD. The pattern varied from diffuse cerebellar hypoplasia to classic Dandy-Walker malformation. Brain disruptions were seen in 11 individuals with hydranencephaly, porencephaly, or white matter loss without cysts. Our series included an expected statistically significant excess of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs (22/41 MZ, 54%) compared to population data (482/1448 MZ, 33.3%; p\u00a0=\u2009.0110), and an unexpected statistically significant excess of dizygotic (DZ) twins (19/41, 46%) compared to the literature cohort (1/46 DZ, 2%; p\u00a0<\u2009.0001. Recurrent association with twin-twin transfusion syndrome, intrauterine growth retardation, and other prenatal factors support disruption of vascular perfusion as the most likely unifying cause.",

This review is followed by a look into the lives of a pair of monozygotic male twins who have lived in different continents for many years, but who stay closely connected. The reasons behind their decision and its impact on their behavioral resemblance and social relationship quality are examined. The next section summarizes recent studies that address the management of monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies, paternity testing in multiple pregnancies, trisomies in twin pregnancies and the roots of resilience. The final portion of this article presents human-interest stories involving reunited Brazilian twins, a new resource for twins with disabled co-twins, twins separated in the Secret of the Nile television series, a new book about Dr Josef Mengele and his horrific twin experiments conducted at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, and a pair of twins dedicated to helping others.",

    "abstract": "Lip print patterns are referred to as unique to each individual, but controversy exists surrounding twins. In this study, the lip prints of 19 pairs of monozygotic and 47 pairs of dizygotic twins were studied. The left lower lip was photographed and the furrows were classified using Renaud's classification. Results showed the same lip pattern was found only in one monozygotic pair (5.3%) and in 4 dizygotic pairs (8.5%), and no significant statistical differences were found between groups (p > 0.05). In monozygotic twins only type C furrows presence displayed statistical significant differences (p=0.034). As for dizygotic twins, there were statistical significant differences in the frequency of type A (p=0.005) and type G furrows (p=0.018). As for the most common types, both groups displayed a higher prevalence of vertical furrows (type B: 97.4% and 96.8%, type A: 86.8% and 87.2%, in monozygotic and dizygotic, respectively). The least frequent furrow type was type I and type E in monozygotic (2.6% and 5.3%, respectively) and types E, F and I, in dizygotic (6.4%, 7.4%. and 7.4%, respectively). Our results seem to point out that lip print patterns should be useful carefully in twins' identification.",

    "abstract": "Blood biomarkers of multiple sclerosis (MS) can provide a better understanding of pathophysiology and enable disease monitoring. Here, we performed quantitative shotgun lipidomics on the plasma of a unique cohort of 73 monozygotic twins discordant for MS. We analyzed 243 lipid species, evaluated lipid features such as fatty acyl chain length and number of acyl chain double bonds, and detected phospholipids that were significantly altered in the plasma of co-twins with MS compared to their non-affected siblings. Strikingly, changes were most prominent in ether phosphatidylethanolamines and ether phosphatidylcholines, suggesting a role for altered lipid signaling in the disease.",

    "abstract": "The Upper Palaeolithic double burial of newborns and the single burial of a ca. 3-month-old infant uncovered at the Gravettian site of Krems-Wachtberg, Austria, are of paramount importance given the rarity of immature human remains from this time. Genome-wide ancient DNA shows that the male infants of the double grave are the earliest reported case of monozygotic twins, while the single grave\u00b4s individual was their 3rd-degree male relative. We assessed the individuals\u00b4 age at death by applying histological and \u00b5CT inspection of the maxillary second incisors (i2) in conjunction with C- and N-isotope ratios and Barium (Ba) intake as biomarker for breastfeeding. The results show that the twins were full-term newborns, and that while individual 2 died at birth, individual 1 survived for about 50 days. The findings show that Gravettian mortuary behaviour also included re-opening of a grave and manipulation of its layout and content.",

    "abstract": "In 2012, a thought experiment in this journal suggested that paternity cases involving monozygotic (MZ) twins as putative fathers could be solved by means of whole genome sequencing (WGS). Although arising from a single fertilization event, MZ twins nevertheless continue to acquire somatic mutations during their development, including those that occur in the germline. Provided that paternity had been narrowed down to the twin pair beforehand by classical DNA analysis, one post-zygotic mutation would suffice to assign the paternal compartment of an offspring genome unambiguously to either twin if that mutation is found in the offspring and one twin, but not in the other twin. Since the publication of a proof-of-principle report in 2014, we have worked up five additional cases of MZ twin germline discrimination in real life, four paternity disputes and one criminal case requiring the identification of a sperm trace donor among a pair of MZ twin brothers. In this opinion paper, we report on the experiences made in the course of our work and take a look at possibilities for further development of the approach.",

    "abstract": "To explore and apply multimodel inference to test the relative contributions of latent genetic, environmental and direct causal factors to the covariation between two variables with data from the classical twin design by estimating model-averaged parameters.\nBehavior genetics is concerned with understanding the causes of variation in phenotypes and the causes of covariation between two or more phenotypes. Two variables may correlate as a result of genetic, shared environmental or unique environmental factors contributing to variation in both variables. Two variables may also correlate because one or both directly cause variation in the other. Furthermore, covariation may result from any combination of these sources, leading to 25 different identified structural equation models. OpenMx was used to fit all these models to account for covariation between two variables collected in twins. Multimodel inference and model averaging were used to summarize the key sources of covariation, and estimate the magnitude of these causes of covariance. Extensions of these models to test heterogeneity by sex are discussed.\nWe illustrate the application of multimodel inference by fitting a comprehensive set of bivariate models to twin data from the Virginia Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders. Analyses of body mass index and tobacco consumption data show sufficient power to reject distinct models, and to estimate the contribution of each of the five potential sources of covariation, irrespective of selecting the best fitting model. Discrimination between models on sample size, type of variable (continuous versus binary or ordinal measures) and the effect size of sources of variance and covariance.\nWe introduce multimodel inference and model averaging approaches to the behavior genetics community, in the context of testing models for the causes of covariation between traits in term of genetic, environmental and causal explanations.",

    "abstract": "In next-generation Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, every object such as a wearable device, a smartphone, a vehicle, and even a sensor or an actuator will be provided with a digital counterpart (twin) with the aim of augmenting the physical object's capabilities and acting on its behalf when interacting with third parties. Moreover, such objects can be able to interact and autonomously establish social relationships according to the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm. In such a context, the goal of this work is to provide an optimal solution for the social-aware placement of IoT digital twins (DTs) at the network edge, with the twofold aim of reducing the latency (i) between physical devices and corresponding DTs for efficient data exchange, and (ii) among DTs of friend devices to speed-up the service discovery and chaining procedures across the SIoT network. To this aim, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming model taking into account limited computing resources in the edge cloud and social relationships among IoT devices.",

    "abstract": "Multiple ovulations and so multiple pregnancies have increased recently in dairy cattle. The incidence of the double ovulation impact in high producers at insemination may be over 20%. Twin pregnancies are undesirable as they seriously compromise the welfare and productive lifespan of the cow and herd economy. Clinical problems extend from the time of pregnancy diagnosis to pregnancy loss, abortion or parturition. Early pregnancy loss or abortion of multiple pregnancies lead in most cases to culling. In cows reaching their term, mean productive lifespan is up to about 300 days shorter for cows delivering twins than for cows delivering singletons. While there is an urgent need to address multiple pregnancy prevention procedures in the foreseeable future, the incidence of twin pregnancies continues to rise in parallel with increased milk production. Herein, we review two contrasting measures proposed for the time of twin pregnancy diagnosis: (1) gonadotropin-releasing hormone treatment for pregnancy maintenance, or (2) embryo reduction. These options are discussed in terms of their implications for individual animal health and herd economy. Our main conclusions find that manual twin reduction has proven to be the best management option, whereas the use of prostaglandin F",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are rare and pose a challenge to radiologists and surgeons. Craniopagus twins, where conjunction involves the cranium, are especially rare. Even in large pediatric centers, radiologists are unlikely to encounter more than one such event in their medical careers. This rarity makes it daunting to select a CT and MRI protocol for these infants. Using the experience of two tertiary pediatric hospitals with six sets of craniopagus twins, this multidisciplinary and multimodal integrated imaging approach highlights the key questions that need addressing in the decision-making process for possible surgical intervention.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive ability plays an important role in mental and physical well-beings in the increasingly ageing populations. Here, based on a sample of 30 cognitive function-discordant monozygotic twin pairs, we aimed to detect specific epigenetic variants potentially related to cognitive function by conducting an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). Association between methylation level of single CpG site with cognitive function score was tested by linear mixed effect model. Functions of cis-regulatory regions and ontology enrichments were predicted by Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were detected by comb-p python library. A list of 28 CpG sites were identified to reach the level of P\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010",

    "abstract": "The increasing number of frail elderly people in our aging society is becoming problematic: about 11% of community-dwelling older persons are frail and another 42% are pre-frail. Consequently, a major challenge in the coming years will be to test people over the age of 60\u00a0years to detect pre-frailty at the earliest stage and to return them to robustness using the targeted interventions that are becoming increasingly available. This challenge requires individual longitudinal monitoring (ILM) or follow-up of community-dwelling older persons using quantitative approaches. This paper briefly describes an effort to tackle this challenge. Extending the detection of the pre-frail stages to other population groups is also suggested. Appropriate algorithms have been used to begin the tracing of faint physiological signals in order to detect transitions from robustness to pre-frailty states and from pre-frailty to frailty states. It is hoped that these studies will allow older adults to receive preventive treatment at the correct institutions and by the appropriate professionals as early as possible, which will prevent loss of autonomy. Altogether, ILM is conceived as an emerging property of databases (\"digital twins\") and not the reverse. Furthermore, ILM should facilitate a coordinated set of actions by the caregivers, which is a complex challenge in itself. This approach should be gradually extended to all ages, because frailty has no age, as is testified by overwork, burnout, and post-traumatic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Even though genetic predisposition has proven to be an important element in Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology, monozygotic (MZ) twins with PD displayed a concordance rate of only about 20% despite their shared identical genetic background.\nWe recruited 5 pairs of MZ twins discordant for idiopathic PD and established skin fibroblast cultures to investigate mitochondrial phenotypes in these cellular models against the background of a presumably identical genome. To test for genetic differences, we performed whole genome sequencing, deep mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing, and tested for mitochondrial deletions by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the fibroblast cultures. Further, the fibroblast cultures were tested for mitochondrial integrity by immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR to quantify gene expression.\nGenome sequencing did not identify any genetic difference. We found decreased mitochondrial functionality with reduced cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, altered mitochondrial morphology, elevated protein levels of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and increased levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-\u03b1 (PPARGC1A) messenger RNA (mRNA) in skin fibroblast cultures from the affected compared to the unaffected twins. Further, there was a tendency for a higher number of somatic mtDNA variants among the affected twins.\nWe demonstrate disease-related differences in mitochondrial integrity in the genetically identical twins. Of note, the clinical expression matches functional alterations of the mitochondria. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:158-164.",

    "abstract": "The population structure of the Indian subcontinent is a tapestry of extraordinary diversity characterized by the amalgamation of autochthonous and immigrant ancestries and rigid enforcement of sociocultural stratification. Here we investigated the genetic origin and population history of the Kumhars, a group of people who inhabit large parts of northern India. We compared 27 previously published Kumhar SNP genotype data sampled from Uttar Pradesh in north India to various modern day and ancient populations.\nVarious approaches such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Admixture, TreeMix concurred that Kumhars have high ASI ancestry, minimal Steppe component and high genomic proximity to the Kurchas, a small and relatively little-known population found ~\u20092500\u2009km away in Kerala, south India. Given the same, biogeographical mapping using Geographic Population Structure (GPS) assigned most Kumhar samples in areas neighboring to those where Kurchas are found in south India.\nWe hypothesize that the significant genomic similarity between two apparently distinct modern-day Indian populations that inhabit well separated geographical areas with no known overlapping history or links, likely alludes to their common origin during or post the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization (estimated by ALDER). Thereafter, while they dispersed towards opposite ends of the Indian subcontinent, their genomic integrity and likeness remained preserved due to endogamous social practices. Our findings illuminate the genomic history of two Indian populations, allowing a glimpse into one or few of numerous of human migrations that likely occurred across the Indian subcontinent and contributed to shape its varied and vibrant evolutionary past.",

    "abstract": "The anatomy of the articular surfaces has historically identified as major responsible for acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis (ACJO). On the other side, the almost 100% prevalence of ACJO in subjects over 50\u00a0years old seems to suggest a multifactorial etiology. We compared ACJO between asymptomatic elderly monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins to investigate the influence of genetics and environmental factors.\nThirty pairs of twins [15MZ-15DZ; mean age (SD): 63.70 (3.31); range: 53-72] were retrospectively enrolled. ACJO was evaluated on MRI through a 4-grade severity scale and ACJ configuration was assessed. Information regarding work activity were obtained. Heritability index was calculated.\nThe intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) value of 0.868 (95% CI; 0.798 to 0.917). An ICC values of 0.889 (95% CI; 0.798 to 0.944) and 0.843 (95% CI, 0.712 to 0.920) were found in the MZ and DZ groups, respectively. The polychoric correlation was 0.857 in the MZ twins and 0.757 in the DZ twins. The calculated heritability index was 0.20 (20%), and the contribution of the shared environment (c2) and unique environment (e2) was 0.66 (66%) and 0.14 (14%), respectively. No relationship between job types and ACJO in both the total cohort (r\u00a0=\u00a00.089; p\u00a0=\u00a00.499) and in the monozygotic (r\u00a0=\u00a00.247; p\u00a0=\u00a00.187) and the dizygotic twin groups (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.084; p\u00a0=\u00a00.658) was found.\nThe role of genetics on ACJO accounts for only 20%; a specific anatomical configuration of the articular surfaces only partially acts on the development of joint osteoarthritis. Environmental factors have the greatest impact.\nIV.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare congenital anomaly. If separation of the conjoined organs is feasible, reconstruction of the skin and tissue defects is a challenge for the plastic surgeon. This article describes the use of opposing triangle flaps in the separation of three different kinds of conjoined twins.\nPlastic surgeons measured each conjoined area and designated the vertical length as a and the width as b. The length of the base of the opposing triangle flap was calculated to match a, and the height of the triangle to match b.\nAfter detailed calculations and careful surgery, the area of the opposing triangle flaps nearly covered the areas exposed after separation, and the three conjoined twins achieved primary closure of their wounds. The pygopagus and ischiopagus twins recovered uneventfully. The omphalopagus twins developed a wound infection, but after daily wound care, the twins recovered within a week.\nWith precise calculations, the opposing triangle flap is a feasible and effective method for defect closure after separation of conjoined twins in certain cases. Clinicians may prefer this technique because it avoids the complications and second surgery necessitated by tissue expanders.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This review article summarizes a program of longitudinal investigation of twins' language acquisition with a focus on causal pathways for specific language impairment (SLI) and nonspecific language impairment in children at 4 and 6 years with known history at 2 years. Method The context of the overview is established by legacy scientific papers in genetics, language, and SLI. Five recent studies of twins are summarized, from 2 to 16 years of age, with a longitudinal perspective of heritability over multiple speech, language, and cognitive phenotypes. Results Replicated moderate-to-high heritability is reported across ages, phenotypes, full population estimates, and estimates for clinical groups. Key outcomes are documentation of a twinning effect of risk for late language acquisition in twins that persists through 6 years of age, greater for monozygotic than dizygotic twins (although zygosity effects disappear at 6 years); heritability is greater for grammar and morphosyntax than other linguistic dimensions, from age 2 years through age 16 years, replicated within twin samples at subsequent age levels and across twin samples at age 16 years. Conclusion There is consistent support for legacy models of genetic influences on language acquisition, updated with a more precise growth signaling disruption model supported by twin data, as well as singleton data of children with SLI and nonspecific language impairment.

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe disorder, for which genetic evidence suggests psychiatric as well as metabolic origins. AN has high somatic and psychiatric comorbidities, broad impact on quality of life, and elevated mortality. Risk factor studies of AN have focused on differences between acutely ill and recovered individuals. Such comparisons often yield ambiguous conclusions, as alterations could reflect different effects depending on the comparison. Whereas differences found in acutely ill patients could reflect state effects that are due to acute starvation or acute disease-specific factors, they could also reflect underlying traits. Observations in recovered individuals could reflect either an underlying trait or a \"scar\" due to lasting effects of sustained undernutrition and illness. The co-twin control design (i.e., monozygotic [MZ] twins who are discordant for AN and MZ concordant control twin pairs) affords at least partial disambiguation of these effects.\nComprehensive Risk Evaluation for Anorexia nervosa in Twins (CREAT) will be the largest and most comprehensive investigation of twins who are discordant for AN to date. CREAT utilizes a co-twin control design that includes endocrinological, neurocognitive, neuroimaging, genomic, and multi-omic approaches coupled with an experimental component that explores the impact of an overnight fast on most measured parameters.\nThe multimodal longitudinal twin assessment of the CREAT study will help to disambiguate state, trait, and \"scar\" effects, and thereby enable a deeper understanding of the contribution of genetics, epigenetics, cognitive functions, brain structure and function, metabolism, endocrinology, microbiology, and immunology to the etiology and maintenance of AN.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput gene sequencing has identified various genetic variants as the culprits for some common hereditary cancers. However, the heritability of a substantial proportion of cancers remains unexplained, which may result from rare deleterious mutations hidden in a myriad of nonsense genetic variations. This poses a great challenge to the understanding of the pathology and thus the rational design of effective treatments for affected patients. Here, whole genome sequencing is employed in a representative case in which one monozygotic twin is\u00a0discordant for lung inflammatory myofibroblastoma to disclose rare tumor-related mutations.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the first-trimester crown-rump length (CRL) and nuchal translucency (NT) discordance in monochorionic diamniotic twins (MCDA) for the prediction of complications-twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) or intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD).\nIntertwin discordance in the CRL and NT was calculated as a percentage of the larger CRL and NT, respectively. The performance of inter twin discordance (CRL\u2009\u2265\u200910% and NT\u2265\u200920%) for predicting complications was analysed using standard statistical screening test methods.\nFifty-eight MCDA twin pregnancies were studied. Out of them, 19 (32%) pregnancies resulted in one of the complications studied (4 TTTS, 10 sFGR, 5 IUFD). CRL and NT discordance showed an increased probability of developing complications positive likelihood ratio (LR+) {95% confidence interval}: 2.05 {0.46-9.23} and 1.88 {1.03-3.45}, respectively. NT discordance showed a sensitivity of 57%.\nAlthough discordant first-trimester CRL and NT in monochorionic twins are poor screening tools for early prediction, if positive, they increase the risk of developing complications.",

    "abstract": "Pleuropulmonary blastomas (PPB) are rare aggressive paediatric lung malignancies and are among the most common DICER1-related disorders: it is estimated that 75-80% of children with a PPB have the DICER1 mutation. DICER1 mutations are responsible for familial tumour susceptibility syndrome with an increased risk of tumours. In approximately 35% of families with children manifesting PPB, further malignancies may be observed. Symptoms of DICER1 syndrome may vary, even within monozygotic twins. Preventive screening of carriers with DICER1 mutations is important and follow-up is undertaken as recommended by the 2016 International PPB Register.\nWe present two pairs of monozygotic twins. In one pair of 4-year, 2-month old girls, both with DICER1 mutation, one developed PPB(II) and her identical sibling had acute transient hepatitis. In the other pair of 19-month-old female babies, one had a history of bronchopulmonary hypoplasia and developed PPB(III) without DICER1 mutation, and her identical sibling had allergic asthma. Both patients with PPB were treated with R0 resection and received 12\u2009cycles of postoperative chemotherapy. At the most recent review, the twins had been followed up for six and eight years, respectively, and they all remained healthy. However, the height and weight of the patients with PPB were lower than those of their respective identical sister.\nPPB is rare, especially in monozygotic twins. We emphasise the importance of genetic testing and follow-up in monozygotic twins with PPB. During the follow-up, children surviving PPB should be monitored closely for growth and development disorders which caused by chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS, OMIM#606232), or 22q13 deletion syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder caused by deletion of the distal long arm of chromosome 22 with a variety of clinical features that display considerably heterogeneous degrees of severity. The SHANK3 gene is understood to be the critical gene for the neurological features of this syndrome.\nWe describe one pair of boy-girl twins with a 22q13 deletion not involving the SHANK3 gene. Interestingly, the clinical and molecular findings of the two patients were identical, likely resulting from germline mosaicism in a parent. The boy-girl twins showed intellectual disability, speech absence, facial dysmorphism, cyanosis, large fleshy hands and feet, dysplastic fingernails and abnormal behaviors, and third-generation sequencing showed an identical de novo interstitial deletion of 6.0\u2009Mb in the 22q13.31-q13.33 region.\nOur case suggests that prenatal diagnosis is essential for normal parents with affected children due to the theoretical possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Our results also indicated that other genes located in the 22q13 region may have a role in explaining symptoms in individuals with PMS. In particular, we propose that four candidate genes, CELSR1, ATXN10, FBLN1 and WNT7B, may also be involved in the etiology of the clinical features of PMS. However, more studies of smaller interstitial deletions with 22q13 are needed to corroborate our hypothesis and better define the genotype-phenotype correlation. Our findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of PMS.",

    "abstract": "Familial and genetic factors seem to contribute to the development of depression but whether this varies with age at diagnosis remains unclear. We examined the influence of familial factors on the risk of depression by age at first diagnosis.\nWe included 23\u00a0498 monozygotic and 39\u00a0540 same-sex dizygotic twins from the population-based Danish Twin Registry, followed from 1977 through 2011 in nationwide registers. We used time-to-event analyses accounting for censoring and competing risk of death to estimate cumulative incidence, casewise concordance, relative recurrence risk, and heritability of first depression by age using monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic twin pairs.\nDuring follow-up, a total of 1545 twins were diagnosed with depression. For twins at age 35 or younger at first depression, heritability was estimated to be 24.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6-43.1%), whereas at age 90 it was 14.7% (95% CI, 3.1-26.3%). The relative recurrence risk was higher at younger ages: At age 35, the risk was 27.7-fold (95% CI, 20.0-35.5) and 6.9-fold (95% CI, 3.9-9.8) higher than the population risk for monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic twins, respectively, while the corresponding numbers were 3.0 (95% CI, 2.3-3.6) and 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3-2.2) at age 90. Heritability seemed similar for male and female twins.\nFamilial risk of depression, caused either by genes or shared environment, seemed to slightly decrease with age at diagnosis and an elevated concordance risk for monozygotic over same-sex dizygotic pairs suggested a genetic contribution to the development of depression.",

    "abstract": "DNA base identification is a proper and high specificity method. However, identification could be challenged in a situation where there is no database or the DNA sequence is almost identical, as in the case of monozygotic (MZ) twins. The aim of this study was to introduce a novel forensic method for distinguishing between almost identical MZ twins by means of an intraoral scanner using the 3D digital pattern of the human palate.\nThe palatal area of 64 MZ twins and 33 same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twins (DZSS) and seven opposite-sex dizygotic twins (DZOS) were scanned three times with an intraoral scanner. From the scanned data, an STL file was created and exported into the GOM Inspect\u00ae inspection software. All scans within a twin pair were superimposed on each other. The average deviation between scans of the same subject (intra-subject deviation, ISD) and between scans of the two siblings within a twin pair (intra-twin deviation, ITD) was measured. One-sided tolerance interval covering 99% of the population with 99% confidence was calculated for the ISD (upper limit) and the ITD (lower limit).\nThe mean ISD of the palatal scan was 35.3\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00b1\u20090.78\u2009\u03bcm. The calculated upper tolerance limit was 95\u2009\u03bcm. The mean ITD of MZ twins (406\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00b1\u200915\u2009\u03bcm) was significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) higher than the ISD, and it was significantly lower than the ITD of DZSS twins (594\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00b1\u200953\u2009\u03bcm, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and the ITD of DZOS twins (853\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00b1\u2009202\u2009\u03bcm, p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nThe reproducibility of palatal intraoral scans proved to be excellent. The morphology of the palate shows differences between members of MZ twins despite their almost identical DNA, indicating that this method could be useful in forensic odontology.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate whether the alterations of time intervals and velocity-time integrals (VTIs) of ductus venosus (DV) Doppler flow could predict evolving twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) in monochorionic diamniotic (MD) twin pregnancies in the second trimester. DV Doppler waveforms of MD twin pregnancies were retrospectively analyzed. Time intervals and VTIs of the accelerating phase of S-wave (S1 and VTI-1), decelerating phase of S-wave (S2 and VTI-2) and phase of D-wave (D and VTI-diast) were measured in the recipient twins of TTTS and the larger twins of uncomplicated MD twins. Each parameter was normalized to total time intervals and VTIs. DV parameters of prerecipient twins in pre-TTTS conditions were analyzed. The pre-TTTS condition was defined as the condition within 2 weeks before when TTTS cases fulfilled the criteria. Both recipient twins in TTTS cases and prerecipient twins in pre-TTTS condition showed significantly shorter S1, longer S2, shorter D, smaller VTI-1, larger VTI-2 and smaller VTI-diast than did the larger twins in uncomplicated MD twins (p < .05). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that VTI-2 had better performance, and VTI-2 >45.5% had 87.0% sensitivity, 90.9% specificity, 81.0% positive predictive value and 93.0% negative predictive value for detecting prerecipient twins. Recipient twins complicated with TTTS have characteristic alterations in time intervals and VTIs of DV Doppler flow, which is present even before fulfilling the TTTS criteria. Furthermore, VTI-2 >45.5% is a possible predictive parameter for TTTS in the second trimester.",

    "abstract": "Yes-associated protein (YAP) and TAZ (WW domain containing transcription regulator 1, or WWTR1) are paralog transcriptional regulators, able to integrate mechanical, metabolic, and signaling inputs to regulate cell growth and differentiation during development and neoplastic progression. YAP and TAZ hold common and distinctive structural features, reflecting only partially overlapping regulatory mechanisms. The two paralogs interact with both shared and specific transcriptional partners and control nonidentical transcriptional programs. Although most of the available literature considers YAP and TAZ as functionally redundant, they play distinctive or even contrasting roles in different contexts. The issue of their divergent roles is currently underexplored but holds fundamental implications for mechanistic and translational studies. Here, we aim to review the available literature on the biological functions of YAP and TAZ, highlighting differential roles that distinguish these two paralogues.",

    "abstract": "Son preference has been linked to excess female under-5 mortality in India, and considerable literature has explored whether parents invest more resources in sons relative to daughters-which we refer to as explicit discrimination-leading to girls' poorer health status and, consequently, higher mortality. However, this literature has not adequately controlled for the implicit discrimination processes that sort girls into different types of families (e.g., larger) and at earlier parities. To better address the endogeneity associated with implicit discrimination processes, we explore the association between child sex and postneonatal under-5 mortality using a sample of mixed-sex twins from four waves of the Indian National Family Health Survey. Mixed-sex twins provide a natural experiment that exogenously assigns a boy and a girl to families at the same time, thus controlling for selectivity into having an unwanted female child. We document a sizable impact of explicit discrimination on girls' excess mortality in India, particularly compared with a placebo analysis in sub-Saharan Africa, where girls have a survival advantage. We also show that explicit discrimination weakened for birth cohorts after the mid-1990s, especially in northern India, but further weakening has stalled since the mid-2000s, thus contributing to understandings of how the micro-processes underlying the female mortality disadvantage have changed over time.",

    "abstract": "We explored the genetic architecture of metabolic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and their clustering in Chinese boys and girls. Seven metabolic traits (body mass index [BMI], waist circumference [WC], systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP], total cholesterol [TC], triglyceride [TG], and uric acid [UA]) were measured in a sample of 1016 twins between 8 and 17 years of age, recruited from the Qingdao Twin Registry. Cholesky, independent pathway, and common pathway models were used to identify the latent genetic structure behind the clustering of these metabolic traits. Genetic architecture of these metabolic traits was largely similar in boys and girls. The highest heritability was found for BMI (a2 = 0.63) in boys and TC (a2 = .69) in girls. Three heritable factors, adiposity (BMI and WC), blood pressure (SBP and DBP), and metabolite factors (TC, TG, and UA), which formed one higher-order latent phenotype, were identified. Latent genetic, common environmental, and unique environmental factors indirectly impacted the three factors through one single latent factor. Our results suggest that there is one latent factor influencing several metabolic traits, which are known risk factors of CVDs in young Chinese twins. Latent genetic, common environmental, and unique environmental factors indirectly imposed on them. These results inform strategies for gene pleiotropic discovery and intervening of CVD risk factors during childhood and adolescence.",

It is found that although the grain size of RTM and LTB specimens is almost the same, different types of nano-twins have been produced. Moreover, the effect of RTM and LTB processing on high temperature oxidation behavior of nickel-based superalloy GH738 at 700 \u00b0C is investigated. The result shows that LTB specimen has the best high temperature oxidation resistance owing to the formation of nano-grains and higher twins density, which induce to form a continuous protective Al",

    "abstract": "The increase in the development of digital twins brings several advantages to inspection and maintenance, but also new challenges. Digital models capable of representing real equipment for full remote inspection demand the synchronization, integration, and fusion of several sensors and methodologies such as stereo vision, monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), laser and RGB-D camera readings, texture analysis, filters, thermal, and multi-spectral images. This multidimensional information makes it possible to have a full understanding of given equipment, enabling remote diagnosis. To solve this problem, the present work uses an edge-fog-cloud architecture running over a publisher-subscriber communication framework to optimize the computational costs and throughput. In this approach, each process is embedded in an edge node responsible for prepossessing a given amount of data that optimizes the trade-off of processing capabilities and throughput delays. All information is integrated with different levels of fog nodes and a cloud server to maximize performance. To demonstrate this proposal, a real-time 3D reconstruction problem using moving cameras is shown. In this scenario, a stereo and RDB-D cameras run over edge nodes, filtering, and prepossessing the initial data. Furthermore, the point cloud and image registration, odometry, and filtering run over fog clusters. A cloud server is responsible for texturing and processing the final results. This approach enables us to optimize the time lag between data acquisition and operator visualization, and it is easily scalable if new sensors and algorithms must be added. The experimental results will demonstrate precision by comparing the results with ground-truth data, scalability by adding further readings and performance.",

    "abstract": "One of the largest twin studies to date suggested that subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is mainly of nongenetic origin, but the causal effect of environmental factors on SAH is yet unknown. We hypothesized that if only one of the twins experience fatal SAH, they do not share the most important environmental risk factor for SAH, namely smoking. If true, such finding would suggest that smoking causes SAH.\nThrough the nationwide cause-of-death register, we followed 16 282 same-sex twin pairs of Finnish origin from the older Finnish Twin Cohort between 1976 and 2018 and identified all participants who died from SAH. For the baseline, we collected risk factor information about smoking, hypertension, physical activity, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and education. We classified the pairs as monozygotic, dizygotic, or of unknown zygosity. We examined the within-pair risk factor differences in the pairs discordant for SAH, that is, where one twin died from SAH and the other did not. We computed both individual (whole cohort) and pairwise (discordant pair) hazard ratios and 95% CIs.\nDuring the 869 469 person-years of follow-up, we identified 116 discordant and 2 concordant (both died from SAH) twin pairs for fatal SAH. Overall, 25 of the discordant twin pairs were monozygotic. For the whole cohort, smoking (occasional/current) was associated with increased risk of SAH death (hazard ratio, 3.33 [CI, 2.24-4.95]) as compared with nonsmokers (never/former). In the pairwise analyses for discordant twin pairs, we found that the twin who smoked had an increased risk of fatal SAH (hazard ratio, 6.33 [CI, 1.87-21.4]) as compared with the nonsmoking twin. The association remained consistent regardless of the twin pairs' zygosity or sex.\nOur results provide strong evidence for a causal, rather than associative, role of smoking in SAH.",

    "abstract": "Delayed-Interval-Delivery (DID) of multiple gestations has been attempted with variable degrees of success in normal, as well as, in anomalous uteri. We describe a delayed interval delivery procedure in a dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy after removal of both, placenta and fetus from one horn by cesarean delivery at 25\u2009weeks followed by spontaneous delivery of the remaining twin at 35\u2009weeks. This was followed by a review of similar cases reported to the literature. The importance of this case resides in the success of DID in spite of chorioamnionitis. Furthermore, this was the second DID attempt where delivery of the first twin was accomplished by cesarean while that of the second one was done by vaginal route.",

    "abstract": "Having twins is associated with more depressive symptoms than having singletons. However, the association between having twins and psychiatric morbidity requiring emergency department visit or inpatient hospitalization is less well known.\nThis study aimed to determine whether women have higher risk of having a psychiatric diagnosis at an emergency department visit or inpatient admission in the year after having twins vs singletons.\nThis retrospective cohort study used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis and procedure codes within the Florida State Inpatient Database and State Emergency Department Database, which have an encrypted identifier allowing nearly all inpatient and emergency department encounters statewide to be linked to the medical record. The first delivery of Florida residents at the age of 13 to 55 years from 2005 to 2014 was included, regardless of parity; women with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification coding for psychiatric illness or substance misuse during pregnancy or for stillbirth or higher-order gestations were excluded. The exposure was an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code during delivery hospitalization of live-born twins. The primary outcome was an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code during an emergency department encounter or inpatient admission within 1 year of delivery for a psychiatric morbidity composite (suicide attempt, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, psychosis, acute stress reaction, or adjustment disorder). The secondary outcome was drug or alcohol use or dependence within 1 year of delivery. We compared outcomes after delivery of live-born twins with singletons using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for sociodemographic and medical factors. We tested for interactions between independent variables in the primary model and conducted sensitivity analyses stratifying women by insurance type and presence of severe intrapartum morbidity or medical comorbidities.\nA total of 17,365 women who had live-born twins and 1,058,880 who had singletons were included. Within 1 year of birth, 1.6% of women delivering twins (n=270) and 1.6% of women delivering singletons (n=17,236) had an emergency department encounter or inpatient admission coded for psychiatric morbidity (adjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.14). Coding for drug or alcohol use or dependence in an emergency department encounter or inpatient admission in the year after twin vs singleton delivery was also similar (n=96 [0.6%] vs n=6222 [0.6%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.36). However, women with public health insurance were more likely to be coded for drug or alcohol use or dependence after twin than singleton delivery (n=75 [1.2%] vs n=4858 [1.0%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.60). Women with \u22651 medical comorbidity, severe maternal morbidity, or low income also had an increased risk of psychiatric morbidity after twin delivery (comorbidities, n=7438 [42.8%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.34; severe maternal morbidity, n=940 [5.4%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-1.81; lowest income quartile, n=4409 [26.8%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-1.40; second-lowest income quartile, n=4770 [29.0%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.43).\nOverall, diagnostic codes for psychiatric illness or substance misuse in emergency department visits or hospital admissions in the year after twin vs singleton delivery are similar. However, women with who are low income or have public health insurance, comorbidities, or severe maternal morbidity are at an increased risk of postpartum psychiatric morbidity after twin vs singleton delivery.",

    "abstract": "A digital twin is a digital replica of a physical entity to which it is remotely connected. A digital twin can provide a rich representation of the corresponding physical entity and enables sophisticated control for various purposes. Although the concept of the digital twin is largely known, designing digital twins based systems has not yet been fully explored. In practice, digital twins can be applied in different ways leading to different architectural designs. To guide the architecture design process, we provide a pattern-oriented approach for architecting digital twin-based Internet of Things (IoT) systems. To this end, we propose a catalog of digital twin architecture design patterns that can be reused in the broad context of systems engineering. The patterns are described using the well-known documentation template and support the various phases in the systems engineering life cycle process. For illustrating the application of digital twin patterns, we adopt a case study in the agriculture and food domain.",

Information on adverse long term outcomes (a composite of mortality and neurodevelopmental disorders) were retrieved from their electronic medical record, and the risk factors were determined.\nThe median follow-up duration was 8 years (range 4-13 years). Adverse composite long term outcomes were observed in 6.6% (15/227). Gestation at delivery < 32 week (p = 0.001) and inter-twin delivery interval of > 30 min (P = 0.000) were significantly associated with adverse long term outcomes of the second twin on multivariate analysis. Second twins in the combined vaginal- caesarean birth group had no significant increase in adverse outcomes compared to those in the vaginal-vaginal birth group.\nAdverse long term outcomes were uncommon among second twins born to mothers who attempted vaginal delivery.

    "abstract": "Colloid cysts are rare developmental lesions, accounting for approximately 1% of intracranial tumors. Often, these benign lesions are asymptomatic, but they are associated with significant mortality as a result of acute hydrocephalus. This mortality in patients with vague or no symptoms dictates a need for better understanding of the etiology of colloid cysts to expedite diagnosis and management. We present a case of monozygotic twins with colloid cysts to propose a genetic etiology for colloid cyst.\nPreviously healthy male monozygotic twins presented 4 years apart with headache secondary to hydrocephalus as a result of colloid cysts. Both patients underwent multiple surgeries and were doing well at last follow-up.\nThe present case adds to a body of literature of familial colloid cysts, suggesting higher concordance in monozygotic compared with dizygotic twins. This may be due to high genetic load, shared intrauterine environment, epigenetic changes, or genetic mutation. This literature review suggests that given high morbidity and mortality of colloid cysts, screening may be beneficial. Even in the absence of a single, definitive genetic etiology, we recommend consideration of genetic screening or, at a minimum, screening with neuroimaging for monozygotic twins in cases where 1 twin is diagnosed with colloid cyst.",

We aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of combining high-resolution imaging techniques and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to describe cerebrovascular structure and function in vivo. We tested our methodology by examining the null hypothesis that monozygotic twins (18-30 yr) would exhibit similar CoW structure and function. Six twin pairs underwent 3T magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck and B-mode Doppler ultrasound for velocity and diameter recordings in the vertebral and internal carotid arteries under three conditions (rest, hypercapnia, and exercise). Artery diameter, length, tortuosity, and bifurcation angle were assessed in regions of interest of the CoW. We simulated hemodynamics to determine the cardiac-cycle time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), and relative residence time (RRT). We observed low and insignificant intraclass correlations (ICC) between twins in all regions for diameter (ICC range 0.000-0.657, ",

    "abstract": "Previous research has shown that the prenatal environment, commonly indexed by birth weight (BW), is a predictor of morphological brain development. We previously showed in monozygotic (MZ) twins associations between BW and brain morphology that were independent of genetics. In the present study, we employed a longitudinal MZ twin design to investigate whether variations in prenatal environment (as indexed by discordance in BW) are associated with resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) and with structural connectivity. We focused on the limbic and default mode networks (DMNs), which are key regions for emotion regulation and internally generated thoughts, respectively. One hundred and six healthy adolescent MZ twins (53 pairs; 42% male pairs) followed longitudinally from birth underwent a magnetic resonance imaging session at age 15. Graph theoretical analysis was applied to rs-FC measures. TrackVis was used to determine track count as an indicator of structural connectivity strength. Lower BW twins had less efficient limbic network connectivity as compared to their higher BW co-twin, driven by differences in the efficiency of the right hippocampus and right amygdala. Lower BW male twins had fewer tracks connecting the right hippocampus and right amygdala as compared to their higher BW male co-twin. There were no associations between BW and the DMN. These findings highlight the possible role of unique prenatal environmental influences in the later development of efficient spontaneous limbic network connections within healthy individuals, irrespective of DNA sequence or shared environment.",

    "abstract": "The only causal therapy is fetoscopic laser surgery (FLS). The aims of this study were to analyze the long-term outcome of monochorionic twins treated by FLS, including their school career, need for therapy and special aid equipment, and free-time activities, and compare their outcome to matched dichorionic twins.\nAmong the 57 women treated at a single fetal treatment center between 2008 and 2017 with FLS because of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, 25 women with 42 children were included in the FLS group. The control group consisted of 16 dichorionic twin pairs matched for birth year, gestational age (GA), birth weight, and sex. The long-term outcome was assessed by a parental questionnaire and a standardized neurodevelopmental examination for children born before 32 gestational weeks or with a birth weight lower than 1500 g. They were also registered into the Swiss Neonatal Network database. The primary outcome was event-free survival, defined as normal neurology, behavior, vision, and hearing. The secondary outcomes were school career, need for therapy and special aid equipment, and free-time activities.\nAn event-free survival was found in 32 children (76%) in the laser and in 24 children (75%) in the control group (p = 0.91). Neurological anomalies were found in 5 children (12%) in the laser group and 3 children (9%) in the control group (p = 1.00). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that GA at delivery was the only predictive factor for event-free survival. There were no significant differences regarding school career, therapies, or special aid equipment between the 2 groups. We found that children without FLS were involved in more free-time activities and needed fewer breaks during physical activity than children with FLS during pregnancy.\nThe outcome of monochorionic twins treated with FLS is comparable to the outcome of dichorionic twins. Long-term neurodevelopment in the cohort was mainly dependent on GA at birth.",

    "abstract": "Keratoconus (KC) is a common, degenerative disorder of the cornea, and genetic factors play a key role in its development. However, the genetic etiology of KC is still unclear. This study used the family of twins as material, using, for the first time, multi-omics analysis, to systematically display the changes in KC candidate factors in patients at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. These can evaluate candidate pathogenic factors in depth and lock onto pathogenic targets.\nThe twins in this study presented classic phenotypes, clear diagnoses, complete case data, and clinical samples, which are excellent materials for genetically studying KC. Whole-exome sequencing was conducted on both the twins and their parents. Transcriptome sequencing was conducted on proband's and health individual's primary human corneal fibroblast cells. Quantitative Real-time PCR and western blot were used to validate the differential gene expressions between the proband and controls. By integrating genomics, transcriptome, and protein level data, multiple consecutive events of KC were systematically analyzed to help better understand the molecular mechanism and genetic basis of KC. The results showed that the accumulation of rare, micro-effect risk variants was the pathogenic factor in this Chinese KC family. Consistent changes in extracellular matrices (ECMs) at the DNA and RNA levels suggested that ECM related changes play a key role in KC pathogenesis. The major gene variants (WNT16, CD248, COL6A2, COL4A3 and ADAMTS3) may affect the expression of related collagens or ECM proteins, thus reducing the amount of ECM in corneas and resulting in KC.\nThis study, the first to explore the genetic etiology of KC via multi-omics analysis under the polygenetic model, has provided new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying KC and an effective strategy for studying KC pathogenesis in the future.",

    "abstract": "Adolescents experience profound neuroendocrine changes, including hormone \"coupling\" between cortisol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone. Emerging research has only begun to elucidate the role of hormone coupling, its genetic and environmental etiology, and the extent to which coupling is impacted by gender, puberty, and family context. We included measures on parent and child mental health, parenting stress, and family conflict of 444 twin pairs and their parents across two timepoints, when youth were on average 8 and 13\u00a0years old, respectively. Structural equation models examined the impact of family context effects on coupling during adolescence. Biometric twin models were then used to probe additive genetic, shared, and non-shared environmental effects on hormone coupling. Hormones were more tightly coupled for females than males, and coupling was sensitive to parental depression and co-twin psychopathology symptoms and stress exposure in females. The association between family context and coupling varied across specific neuroendocrine measures and was largely distinct from pubertal maturation. Biometric models revealed robust shared and non-shared environmental influences on coupling. We found that family antecedents modify the strength of coupling. Environmental influences account for much of the variation on coupling during puberty. Gender differences were found in genetic influences on coupling.",

    "abstract": "A case of cervical spinal cord injury in 12-year-old angular craniopagus twins is presented, with a description of the planning and execution of surgical treatment along with subsequent clinical outcome. The injury occurred following a fall from a standing position, resulting in quadriparesis in one of the twins. Imaging revealed severe craniocervical stenosis resulting from a C1-2 dislocation, and T2-weighted hyperintensity of the cervical spinal cord. After custom halo fixation was obtained, a posterior approach was utilized to decompress and instrument the occiput, cervical, and upper thoracic spine with intraoperative reduction of the dislocation. Early neurological improvement was noted during the acute postoperative phase, and 27 months of follow-up demonstrated intact instrumentation with continued neurological improvement to near baseline. The complexity of managing such an injury, inclusive of the surgical, anesthetic, biomechanical, and ethical considerations, is described in detail.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic cancer with high mortality rate and generally diagnosed in advanced stages. The 5-year disease-free survival is below 40%. MicroRNAs, subset of the non-coding RNA molecules, regulate the translation in post transcriptional level by binding to specific mRNAs to promote or degrade the target oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Abnormal expression of miRNAs were found in numerous human cancer, including ovarian cancer. Investigating the miRNAs derived from the peripheral blood samples can be used as a marker in the diagnose, treatment and prognosis of ovarian cancer. We aimed to find biological markers for early diagnosis of ovarian cancer by investigating BRCA1 gene mutation carrier monozygotic discordant twins and their high risk healthy family individual's miRNAs.\nThe study was conducted on monozygotic twins discordant for ovarian cancer, and the liquid biopsy exploration of miRNAs was performed on mononuclear cells that were isolated from the peripheral blood samples. The miRNA expression profile changes in the study were found by using microarray analysis. miRNA isolation procedure performed from the lymphocyte in accordance with the kit protocol. The presence and quality of the isolated miRNAs screened by electrophoresis. Raw data logarithmic analysis was studied by identifying the threshold, normalization, correlation, mean and median values. Target proteins were detected for each miRNA by using different algorithms.\nAfter the comparison of monozygotic discordant twins for epithelial ovarian carcinoma upregulation of the 4 miRNAs, miR-6131, miR-1305, miR-197-3p, miR-3651 and downregulation of 4 miRNAs, miR-3135b, miR-4430, miR-664b-5p, miR-766-3p were found statically significant.\nThe detected 99 miRNAs out of 2549 miRNAs might be used in the clinic as new biological indicators in the diagnosis and follow up of epithelial ovarian cancer with complementary studies. The miRNA expression profiles were identified to be statistically significant in the evaluation of ovarian cancer etiology, BRCA1 mutation status, and ovarian cancer risk in accordance with the obtained data. There is a need for validation of the miRNAs which were particularly detected between monozygotic twins and its association with ovarian cancer was emphasized in our study in wider cohorts including ovarian cancer patients, and healthy individuals.",

    "abstract": "Chronic widespread pain (CWP) and common mental disorders (CMDs) are common public health problems, but little is known about the role of CWP and CMDs on future adverse outcomes among work disabled individuals. The aims of the study were to investigate the associations between CWP and CMDs with subsequent disability pension (DP), long-term unemployment (>\u200990\u2009days) and all-cause mortality in individuals with sickness absence (SA) and whether the associations were explained by familial factors.\nIn this prospective cohort study, 7884 Swedish twins born between 1933 and 1985 were included and baseline data were gathered from a questionnaire in 1998 to 2006. Register data were used for obtaining information regarding demographics, SA, DP, unemployment and mortality. Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to calculate Hazard Ratios (HR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) for the associations between CWP and/or CMDs with DP, unemployment and mortality, while conditional Cox models for twin pairs provided control for familial confounding.\nHaving either CWP or CMDs among those with a history of SA was associated with a higher risk of DP and all-cause mortality than individuals without CWP and CMDs after controlling for socio-demographic and health factors. Moreover, sick-listed individuals with both CWP and CMDs had a higher risk of DP while those who only had CMDs had a higher risk of long-term unemployment compared to those without CWP and CMDs. The association between CMDs with DP and long-term unemployment was no longer significant when controlling for familial factors.\nCMDs was a risk factor for DP, unemployment and mortality among individuals with SA, while CWP seems to be important in relation to future DP and mortality. Familial factors played a role in the associations between CMDs and DP and CMDs and unemployment.",

    "abstract": "Congenital toxoplasmosis in twin pregnancies is infrequent. We present the case of a monozygotic and monocorial twin pregnancy with maternal toxoplasmosis infection diagnosed at 33 weeks gestation by detecting reactive IgM and IgG and low avidity test for IgG. The detection of the parasite in amniotic fluid could not be performed because the amniocentesis was not done. The term newborns presented cerebral calcifications and bilateral active chorioretinitis without other associated clinical manifestations. They had IgG and IgM reactive for toxoplasmosis. The detection of Toxoplasma gondii was not performed by placental PCR or cord blood. They received treatment during the first year of life with pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine and folinic acid. They had no adverse events associated with the therapy. The diagnostic assessment and treatment does not differ from pregnancies with a single fetus. One or both newborns may be compromised. Multidisciplinary monitoring is essential for the early detection of reactivations or progression of lesions.",

    "abstract": "Major depression (MD) is a debilitating mental health condition with peak prevalence occurring early in life. Genome-wide examination of DNA methylation (DNAm) offers an attractive complement to studies of allelic risk given it can reflect the combined influence of genes and environment. The current study used monozygotic twins to identify differentially and variably methylated regions of the genome that distinguish twins with and without a lifetime history of early-onset MD. The sample included 150 Caucasian monozygotic twins between the ages of 15 and 20 (73% female; Mage\u2009=\u200917.52\u2009SD\u2009=\u20091.28) who were assessed during a developmental stage characterized by relatively distinct neurophysiological changes. All twins were generally healthy and currently free of medications with psychotropic effects. DNAm was measured in peripheral blood cells using the Infinium Human BeadChip 450\u2009K Array. MD associations with early-onset MD were detected at 760 differentially and variably methylated probes/regions that mapped to 428 genes. Genes and genomic regions involved neural circuitry formation, projection, functioning, and plasticity. Gene enrichment analyses implicated genes related to neuron structures and neurodevelopmental processes including cell-cell adhesion genes (e.g., PCDHA genes). Genes previously implicated in mood and psychiatric disorders as well as chronic stress (e.g., NRG3) also were identified. DNAm regions associated with early-onset MD were found to overlap genetic loci identified in the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium meta-analysis of depression. Understanding the time course of epigenetic influences during emerging adulthood may clarify developmental phases where changes in the DNA methylome may modulate individual differences in MD risk.",

    "abstract": "Objectives Transcobalamin II (TC) is an essential plasma protein for the absorption, transportation, and cellular uptake of cobalamin. TC deficiency presents in the first year of life with failure to thrive, hypotonia, lethargy, diarrhea, pallor, mucosal ulceration, anemia, pancytopenia, and agammaglobulinemia. Herein, we present TC deficiency diagnosed in two cases (twin siblings) with a novel variant in the TCN2 gene. Case presentation 4-month-old twins were admitted with fever, respiratory distress, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to thrive. Physical examination findings revealed developmental delay and hypotonia with no head control, and laboratory findings were severe anemia, neutropenia, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Despite normal vitamin B12 and folate levels, homocysteine and urine methylmalonic acid levels were elevated in both patients. Bone marrow examinations revealed hypocellular bone marrow in both cases. The patients had novel pathogenic homozygous c.241C>T (p.Gln81Ter) variant in the TCN2 gene. In both cases, with intramuscular hydroxycobalamin therapy, laboratory parameters improved, and a successful clinical response was achieved. Conclusions In infants with pancytopenia, growth retardation, gastrointestinal manifestations, and immunodeficiency, the inborn error of cobalamin metabolism should be kept in mind. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for better clinical outcomes. What is new? In literature, to date, less than 50 cases with TC deficiency were identified. In this report, we presented twins with TCN2 gene mutation. Both patients emphasized that early and aggressive treatment is crucial for achieving optimal outcomes. In this report, we identified a novel variation in TCN2 gene.",

    "abstract": "Twinning is a critically important deformation mode in hexagonal close-packed metals. Twins are three-dimensional (3D) domains, whose growth is mediated by the motion of facets bounding the 3D twin domains and influences work hardening in metals. An understanding of twin transformations therefore necessitates that the atomic-scale structure and intrinsic mobilities of facets be known and characterized. The present work addresses the former point by systematically characterizing the boundary structures of 3D ",

    "abstract": "The study presents two monozygotic twins (MZ) with multiple impacted teeth, affecting the upper canines and lower second molars, as well as congenital aniridia. The clinical aspect of the upper canines is peculiar because of the different positions-palatal in one and buccal in the other twin. Studies reporting different scenarios of impaction in monozygotic twins can contribute more data to the debate on tooth eruption aetiology and more so in this case because of the association with a genetic panocular disease.

    "abstract": "Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare life-threatening condition affecting the autonomic nervous system that usually presents shortly after birth as hypoventilation or central apnea during sleep. In the majority of cases, heterozygous polyalanine expansion mutations within the third exon of the paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) gene underlie CCHS. Here, we report the generation of two induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from two identical twins with a heterozygous PHOX2B expansion mutation (+5 alanine residues). Both generated lines highly express pluripotency markers, can differentiate into the three germ layers, retain the disease-causing mutation and display normal karyotypes.",

    "abstract": "The tremendous heterogeneity of the human population presents a major obstacle in understanding how autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) contribute to variations in human peripheral immune signatures. To minimize heterogeneity, we made use of a unique cohort of 43 monozygotic twin pairs clinically discordant for MS and searched for disease-related peripheral immune signatures in a systems biology approach covering a broad range of adaptive and innate immune populations on the protein level. Despite disease discordance, the immune signatures of MS-affected and unaffected cotwins were remarkably similar. Twinship alone contributed 56% of the immune variation, whereas MS explained 1 to 2% of the immune variance. Notably, distinct traits in CD4",

    "abstract": "To examine the role of eosinophils in the pre-diagnostic phase of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we studied the influence of genetic and shared environmental risk factors in a twin cohort of IBD.\nWe analysed eosinophil derived neurotoxin (EDN) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in faecal samples from twin pairs with Crohn's disease (\nTwins with Crohn' disease displayed higher levels of EDN (Ratio = 2.98, 1.65-5.37) and ECP (Ratio 1.83, 1.24-2.70) than their healthy siblings. Levels did not differ between healthy twin-siblings and external controls (EDN, Ratio = 1.52, 0.79-2.94 and ECP, Ratio = 0.93, 0.56-1.54). Higher levels of EDN (Ratio = 2.43, 1.13-5.24) and ECP (Ratio = 1.53, 0.92-2.53) were observed among twins with ulcerative colitis vs their healthy siblings. Levels did not differ between healthy twin-siblings and external controls (EDN, Ratio = 1.08, 0.51-2.25 and ECP, Ratio = 1.29, 0.74-2.26). Using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), we found no agreement in levels of EDN or ECP in discordant pairs, except for ECP in monozygotic Crohn's disease pairs (ICC = 0.63). In contrast, agreement was observed in monozygotic pairs concordant for Crohn's disease (EDN, ICC = 0.67 and ECP, ICC = 0.66). The number of eosinophils in rectum was increased in twins with ulcerative colitis vs their healthy sibling (Ratio = 2.22, 1.50-3.27).\nActivation of eosinophils in IBD seems to be a consequence of inflammation rather than an effect of genetic and shared environmental risk factors alone.",

    "abstract": "Opposite-sex twins have shown behavioural and reproductive differences between females and males. These differences may be determined by higher intrauterine levels of androgens among females that were exposed to a male co-twin. The aim of this study was to compare cord blood androgen levels in females from same-sex and opposite-sex twins.\nA prospective study. In this pilot study, we compared cord blood androgens (DHEA-S, \u0394-4 androstenedione, total testosterone-TT) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels in 20 females from same sex and 20 females from opposite-sex dichorionic diamniotic twins. We used generalized estimating equation (GEE) modelling to assess differences in cord blood androgens between females from same-sex twin pregnancies and females from opposite-sex twin pregnancies.\nTwenty opposite-sex twin pairs (female-male twins) and 20 same-sex twin pairs (female-female).\nCord blood total testosterone, \u0394-4 androstenedione, DHEA-S and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels.\nNo difference in the levels of androgens as \u0394-4 androstenedione, total testosterone and SHBG was identified between females that were exposed to a female co-twin compared with females that were exposed to a male co-twin. DHEA-S levels were significantly lower among females from opposite-sex twins compared with females from same-sex twins.\nOur preliminary data do not support the hypothesis that females\u00a0exposed to male co-twins are exposed to higher levels of androgens in utero compared with females exposed to female co-twins. Further studies are needed to explain the reported behavioural and reproductive differences among opposite-sex twins.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to green space has beneficial effects on several cognitive and behavioral aspects. However, to our knowledge, no study addressed intelligence as outcome. We investigated whether the level of urbanicity can modify the association of residential green space with intelligence and behavior in children.\nThis study includes 620 children and is part of the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey (EFPTS), a registry of multiple births in the province of East Flanders, Belgium. Intelligence was assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) in 620 children (310 twin pairs) between 7 and 15 years old. From a subset of 442 children, behavior was determined based on the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Prenatal and childhood residential addresses were geocoded and used to assign green space indicators. Mixed modeling was performed to investigate green space in association with intelligence and behavior while adjusting for potential confounding factors including sex, age, parental education, neighborhood household income, year of assessment, and zygosity and chorionicity. We found that residential green space in association with both intelligence and behavior in children was modified by the degree of urbanicity (p < 0.001). In children living in an urban environment, multivariable adjusted mixed modeling analysis revealed that an IQR increment of residential green space (3,000-m radius) was associated with a 2.6 points (95% CI 1.4-3.9; p < 0.001) higher total intelligence quotient (IQ) and 2.0 points (95% CI -3.5 to -0.4; p = 0.017) lower externalizing behavioral score. In children residing in a rural or suburban environment, no association was found. A limitation of this study is that no information was available on school location and the potential for unmeasured confounding (e.g., time spend outdoors).\nOur results indicate that residential green space may be beneficial for the intellectual and the behavioral development of children living in urban areas. These findings are relevant for policy makers and urban planners to create an optimal environment for children to develop their full potential.",

    "abstract": "The separation of conjoined twins is a challenging and rare operation. Recent technological advances in imaging and three-dimensional printing (3DP) have allowed for enhancements in preoperative surgical planning and intraoperative anatomical orientation for complex operations. This report aims to consolidate the current clinical evidence utilizing 3DP models as an effective tool for surgical planning of conjoined twin separation and to detail our surgical approach for complex hepatic separation and management.\nA literature review was conducted for conjoined twin separations with preoperative use of 3D models including age at attempted separation, operative outcome, 3D modality, and postoperative course between 1998 and 2020. We also conducted a chart review of our electronic medical record for conjoined twin separations between January 2015 and December 2019.\nWe report two cases of conjoined twin separation with preoperative use of 3DP models from our institution: one set in the thoracoomphaloischiopagus orientation and the other set in the thoracoomphalopagus orientation with the presence of intrahepatic vascular anomalies. The literature review produced 10 case reports of conjoined twin separation with use preoperative 3D models accounting for 17 individual separation procedures. We summarize our preoperative radiological planning, the evidence of 3DP models as an educational and preoperative tool, ideal timing for separation, and our surgical approach for complex hepatic separation.\nConjoined twin separation requires a multidisciplinary effort to address the multisystem surgical and medical needs of these patients. These complex patients require extensive preoperative imaging for planning separation, and we strongly recommend utilizing 3D printed models when possible for better surgeon understanding of complex variable anatomy. We have found numerous reports of successful conjoined twin separation using 3DP technology in preoperative planning. The use of three-dimensional printed models for preoperative assessments is an invaluable tool and is rapidly improving in fidelity.\nOperative technique and case series.\nLevel IV.",

    "abstract": "To examine the concordance rate of non-chromosomal congenital malformations in twin pairs based on zygosity.\nRetrospective cohort study.\nA tertiary hospital in Korea.\nTwin pairs born at Seoul National University Hospital between 2001 and 2019.\nCongenital malformations were diagnosed by postnatal workups of neonates or autopsy in cases of stillborn infants. Zygosity was confirmed by sex, chorionicity and DNA analysis.\nConcordance rate of congenital malformations in twin pairs based on zygosity.\nIn total, 3386 twin pairs were included. The risk of a congenital malformation in the index twin increased significantly if the co-twin had the congenital malformation, and the concordance rate was higher in monozygotic (MZ) than in dizygotic (DZ) twins (37.04 versus 16.77, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). An increased risk of a congenital malformation in the presence of the same congenital malformation in the co-twin was observed only for malformations of the nervous system, eye/ear/face/neck, circulatory system, cleft lip/palate, genital organs, urinary system and musculoskeletal system. Significantly higher concordance rates in MZ than in DZ twin pairs were observed only for the nervous system (40.00 versus 0.00, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), circulatory system (32.97 versus 19.74, P\u00a0=\u00a00.021), cleft lip/palate (44.44 versus 0.00, P\u00a0=\u00a00.017) and urinary system (22.22 versus 0.00, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), whereas significant differences were not found for the genital organs or musculoskeletal system.\nMonozygotic twins had higher concordance rates than DZ twins only in specific organ systems. It may be speculated that nervous system, circulatory system, cleft lip/palate and urinary system are primarily genetically affected.\nMonozygotic twins had higher concordance rates than dizygotic twins only in specific organ systems.",

The risk of a congenital malformation in the index twin increased significantly if the co-twin had the congenital malformation, and the concordance rate was higher in monozygotic (MZ) than in dizygotic (DZ) twins (37.04 versus 16.77, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). An increased risk of a congenital malformation in the presence of the same congenital malformation in the co-twin was observed only for malformations of the nervous system, eye/ear/face/neck, circulatory system, cleft lip/palate, genital organs, urinary system and musculoskeletal system. Significantly higher concordance rates in MZ than in DZ twin pairs were observed only for the nervous system (40.00 versus 0.00, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), circulatory system (32.97 versus 19.74, P\u00a0=\u00a00.021), cleft lip/palate (44.44 versus 0.00, P\u00a0=\u00a00.017) and urinary system (22.22 versus 0.00, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), whereas significant differences were not found for the genital organs or musculoskeletal system.",

    "abstract": "To determine the compliance and effectiveness of fortnightly ultrasound surveillance for detection of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) in monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin gestations.\nThis is a retrospective study of ultrasound surveillance of MCDA twins for TTTS. Our surveillance protocol requires fortnightly ultrasounds starting at 16\u2009weeks of gestational age (GA) continuing until delivery. Compliance was assessed by determining the GA of surveillance initiation and time between ultrasounds. GA and Quintero Stage at diagnosis were evaluated to determine whether TTTS was detected prior to advanced disease (Quintero Stage III +) or fetal demise.\nOf 442 women, 264 (59.7%) initiated surveillance after 16\u2009weeks; follow-up ultrasounds were late in 17.4% of cases. TTTS was diagnosed in 43 (9.7%) women at a median GA of 19.7 [17.4, 23.9] weeks. Of 25/43 (58.1%) cases diagnosed during protocol compliance, 12 had advanced disease and two had fetal demise. A similar proportion of diagnoses (n = 18), made while non-compliant, exhibited advanced disease (11/18, 61.1%, P = .40). Thirteen diagnoses occurred during periods of increased ultrasound frequency due to abnormalities (ie, fluid/estimated fetal weight discrepancies or Doppler abnormalities).\nIn this population, fortnightly ultrasound compliance was suboptimal. Advanced disease and fetal demise occurred during protocol compliance.",

Myotonic dystrophy and familial adenomatous polyposis are the most frequently associated disorders with multiple pilomatricomas. There are few reports relating these tumors to other genetic syndromes. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by intellectual disability and typical dysmorphic characteristics. There are five case reports relating to multiple pilomatricoma to Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, an association that needs to be clarified. For this reason, we report the first case of multiple pilomatricoma in monozygotic twins with typical Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) or necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis, was described separately by both Kikuchi and Fujimoto in Japan in the early 1970's. Despite its rarity in the pediatric population, it is an important differential in persistent lymphadenopathy. Familial cases of KFD in the literature are rare. Here we describe the first reported case of KFD in non-identical twin sisters.\nTwin 1 presented with a 3-week history of worsening right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy, daily fevers, significant lethargy, weight loss and arthralgia of her knees and ankles at the age of 12\u2009years in 2015. She had had an unremarkable medical history. A biopsy of her lymph nodes showed histiocytic necrosis consistent with KFD. Twin 2 presented with a three-week history of lethargy, fatigue, weight loss and left-sided posterior cervical chain lymphadenopathy at 16\u2009years of age in 2018. She had a history of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome and celiac disease. A biopsy of her lymph nodes was undertaken and showed histiocytic necrosis consistent with KFD.\nKFD is a rare but self-limiting pathological process of necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis. Although further research is needed, there is an increasing amount of evidence which suggests a multifactorial pathological basis of disease. The two cases we document here are the first reported cases of familial KFD in dizygotic HLA-identical twins which reinforces the likely HLA-linkage in the etiology of KFD.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to explore secular trends in age at voice change (AVC), estimate heritability of AVC and investigate to what extent common genes influence the association between AVC and body mass index (BMI) in South Korean males. The sample of 955 male twins consisted of 241 pairs and 118 co-twin missing monozygotic (MZ) twins, 82 pairs and 50 co-twin missing dizygotic (DZ) twins and 141 male members of opposite-sex DZ twins who participated in telephone surveys in the South Korean Twin Registry. AVC was asked of twins during the surveys. The mean (SD) age of the sample was 18.92 (2.42) years (range: 16.00-29.25 years). The birth years of the twins were divided into two groups (1988-1993, 1994-2001). Kaplan-Meyer survival analyses were conducted to compute the mean age of AVC in the total sample as well as to test mean differences between the two birth cohorts. Maximum likelihood twin correlations and univariate and bivariate model-fitting analyses were performed. The mean AVC in the total sample was 14.19 (95% CI [14.09, 14.29]) years. The mean AVC significantly declined from 14.38 to 14.02 years from 1988 to 2001, confirming downward trends in AVC in recent years. Heritability for AVC was .59 (95% CI [.50, .67]), which was within the range reported in most Western twin studies. Although the phenotypic correlation between AVC and BMI was modest (r = -.14; 95% CI [-.07, -.21]), it was entirely mediated by common genes, similar to what has been found in females in prior twin studies. In conclusion, the present twin study underscores the importance of genetic influences on pubertal timing and its association with BMI in South Korean males.",

    "abstract": "To this date little information exists on the effects, clinical course and outcome of the COVID-19 among patients undergoing transplantation.\nA 35\u2009year old male referred with loss of sense of smell and taste after having close contact with his brother who was diagnosed with COVID-19 five days prior to his symptoms. The patient had undergone liver transplantation 3\u2009years prior to his referral due to primary sclerosing cholangitis in association with ulcerative colitis and was using immunosuppressive medications. The patient referred to a local physician with mild symptoms of fatigue, cough, myalgia, dizziness, and nausea/vomiting with a fear of contracting the disease. Except for a CRP of 32 his other blood tests were normal. After 3\u2009days of hospital admission the patient was discharged with a good condition. His brother had developed fever, chills, headache, mild dyspnea and an objective loss of sense of smell and taste and was sent home and advised to self-quarantine. Both patients had CT scans in favor of COVID-19.\nOur patient who had liver transplantation and COVID-19 did not present more severe symptoms compared to his counterpart without liver transplantation and did not need to be hospitalized or be given antiviral drugs for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Nutritional and lifestyle changes remain at the core of healthy aging and disease prevention. Accumulating evidence underscores the impact of genetic, metabolic, and host gut microbial factors on individual responses to nutrients, paving the way for the stratification of nutritional guidelines. However, technological advances that incorporate biological, nutritional, lifestyle, and health data at an unprecedented scale and depth conceptualize a future where preventative dietary interventions will exceed stratification and will be highly individualized. We herein discuss how genetic information combined with longitudinal metabolomic, immune, behavioral, and gut microbial parameters, and bioclinical variables could define a digital replica of oneself, a \"virtual digital twin,\" which could serve to guide nutrition in a personalized manner. Such a model may revolutionize the management of obesity and its comorbidities, and provide a pillar for healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive genetic and neuroimaging studies, detailed cellular mechanisms underlying schizophrenia and bipolar disorder remain poorly understood. Recent progress in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enables identification of cell-type-specific pathophysiology. However, its application to psychiatric disorders is challenging because of methodological difficulties in analyzing human brains and the confounds due to a lifetime of illness. Brain organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of the patients are a powerful avenue to investigate the pathophysiological processes. Here, we generated iPSC-derived cerebral organoids from monozygotic twins discordant for psychosis. scRNA-seq analysis of the organoids revealed enhanced GABAergic specification and reduced cell proliferation following diminished Wnt signaling in the patient, which was confirmed in iPSC-derived forebrain neuronal cells. Two additional monozygotic twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia also confirmed the excess GABAergic specification of the patients' neural progenitor cells. With a well-controlled genetic background, our data suggest that unbalanced specification of excitatory and inhibitory neurons during cortical development underlies psychoses.",

    "abstract": "The public health disorder gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is linked with several comorbidities, including oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), but whether life expectancy is reduced by GORD is uncertain. This study assessed all-cause and cancer-specific mortality in GORD after controlling for confounding by heredity and other factors.\nPopulation-based cohort study from 1998 to 2015.\nSwedish nationwide study.\nTwins (n=40\u2009961) born in 1958 or earlier in Sweden.\nGORD symptoms reported in structured computer-assisted telephone interviews.\nThe primary outcome was all-cause mortality and the secondary outcome was cancer-specific mortality among twins with GORD and twins without GORD. HRs and 95% CIs were analysed using parametric survival models, both in individual twin analyses and co-twin pair analyses, with adjustment for body mass index, smoking, education and comorbidity.\nAmong 40\u2009961 individual twins, 5812 (14.2%) had GORD at baseline and 8062 (19.7%) died during follow-up of up to 16 years. The risks of all-cause mortality (HR=1.00, 95%\u2009CI: 0.94-1.07) and cancer-specific mortality (HR=0.99, 95%\u2009CI: 0.89-1.10) were not increased in individual twins with GORD compared with individual twins without GORD. Similarly, there were no differences in mortality outcomes in within-pair analyses. The OAC-specific mortality rate was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.32-0.66) per 1000 person-years in individual twins with GORD and 0.22 (95% CI: 0.18-0.27) per 1000 person-years without GORD, rendering an adjusted HR of 2.01 (95% CI: 1.35-2.98).\nGORD did not increase all-cause or cancer-specific mortality when taking heredity and other confounders into account. The increased relative risk of mortality in OAC was low in absolute numbers.",

The risks of all-cause mortality (HR=1.00, 95%\u2009CI: 0.94-1.07) and cancer-specific mortality (HR=0.99, 95%\u2009CI: 0.89-1.10) were not increased in individual twins with GORD compared with individual twins without GORD. Similarly, there were no differences in mortality outcomes in within-pair analyses. The OAC-specific mortality rate was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.32-0.66) per 1000 person-years in individual twins with GORD and 0.22 (95% CI: 0.18-0.27) per 1000 person-years without GORD, rendering an adjusted HR of 2.01 (95% CI: 1.35-2.98).",

    "abstract": "A digital twin is a digital representation of a physical asset reproducing its data model, its behaviour and its communication with other physical assets. Digital twins act as a digital replica for the physical object or process they represent, providing nearly real-time monitoring and evaluation without being in close proximity. Although most of their concrete applications can be found mainly in the industrial context, healthcare represents another relevant area where digital twins can have a disruptive impact. The main research question tackled by this paper is about the integration of digital twins with agents and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) technologies in healthcare. After providing an overview of the application of digital twins in healthcare, in this paper, we discuss our vision about agent-based digital twins, and we present a first case study, about the application of agent-based digital twins to the management of severe traumas.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) causes congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), which is characterized by fetal demise, microcephaly and other abnormalities. ZIKV in the pregnant woman circulation must cross the placental barrier that includes fetal endothelial cells and trophoblasts, in order to reach the fetus. CZS occurs in ~1-40% of cases of pregnant women infected by ZIKV, suggesting that mothers' infection by ZIKV during pregnancy is not deterministic for CZS phenotype in the fetus. Therefore, other susceptibility factors might be involved, including the host genetic background. We have previously shown that in three pairs of dizygotic twins discordant for CZS, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from the CZS-affected twins presented differential in vitro ZIKV susceptibility compared with NPCs from the non-affected. Here, we analyzed human-induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived (hiPSC-derived) trophoblasts from these twins and compared by RNA-Seq the trophoblasts from CZS-affected and non-affected twins. Following in vitro exposure to a Brazilian ZIKV strain (ZIKVBR), trophoblasts from CZS-affected twins were significantly more susceptible to ZIKVBR infection when compared with trophoblasts from the non-affected. Transcriptome profiling revealed no differences in gene expression levels of ZIKV candidate attachment factors, IFN receptors and IFN in the trophoblasts, either before or after ZIKVBR infection. Most importantly, ZIKVBR infection caused, only in the trophoblasts from CZS-affected twins, the downregulation of genes related to extracellular matrix organization and to leukocyte activation, which are important for trophoblast adhesion and immune response activation. In addition, only trophoblasts from non-affected twins secreted significantly increased amounts of chemokines RANTES/CCL5 and IP10 after infection with ZIKVBR. Overall, our results showed that trophoblasts from non-affected twins have the ability to more efficiently activate genes that are known to play important roles in cell adhesion and in triggering the immune response to ZIKV infection in the placenta, and this may contribute to predict protection from ZIKV dissemination into fetuses' tissues.",

    "abstract": "It is likely that genetic factors play a role in the susceptibility to, and recovery from, COVID-19. A survey of ongoing twin research could produce findings likely to help in the prevention and management of this pandemic. This survey is followed by a review of research comparing selected features of asthmatic and nonasthmatic twins, links between twin mammals and COVID-19, and relationships between twin delivery and the three 'Rs'. The final section of this article presents newsworthy twin-related items, some associated with COVID-19. They include a summary of the Rainman Twins film, a study of anal prints, the 'Twins' Irish pub, newborn twins 'Covid and Corona', the death of a surgeon who separated conjoined twins, and Twinco, a twin-based supply company.",

    "abstract": "Delayed diagnosis of congenital tuberculosis (TB) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a serious problem in terms of infection control. Here, we report our preemptive infection control activities implemented after the diagnosis of miliary TB in a mother of preterm twins (index twins, NB1 and NB2) in the NICU. In addition, we reviewed previous case reports of congenital TB exposure in the NICU setting. Immediately after diagnosing miliary TB in the mother, the index twins were isolated before their TB diagnosis and received preemptive anti-TB medication; contact investigations were also conducted. Eventually, NB1 was diagnosed with congenital TB at 29 days of age, and NB2 showed no definite evidence of TB. Through contact investigation, 11 of the 16 exposed infants received isoniazid prophylaxis and no positive tuberculin skin test results were obtained after 3 months. One of the 31 exposed healthcare workers showed new interferon-gamma release assay conversion. Moreover, our case showed a much shorter contagious period compared to that in previous reports (8 versus 17-102 days). This suggests that a high index of suspicion and prompt measures can help prevent congenital TB outbreaks and reduce the burden of infection control activities in the NICU.",

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder with high clinical heterogeneity. Twin study is valuable to estimate the contributions of gene and/or environment to phenotypic variance. However, SCA3 twins were extremely sparse and rarely reported.\nA pair of monozygotic twins with SCA3 was assessed using well-acknowledged scales. Genetic modifiers and methylation levels were determined by Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing.\nSharing identical CAG repeat lengths, the twins presented with similar symptoms, whereas, the younger sister had an earlier age at onset of two years. The occurrence time and severity of constipation, blepharospasm and fasciculation were markedly different between the twins. Notable methylation level differences of several CpG sites existed between the twins.\nIt is the first time to report SCA3 monozygotic twin worldwide. The role of epigenetic factors in the phenotype variance deserved more attention. The DNA methylation may influence the phenotypic variance by altering the occurrence time and severity of symptoms, indicating its potential in alleviating the disease.",

    "abstract": "Twin growth discordance was demonstrated to be a risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes, and prenatal ultrasonographic methods were utilized to predict twin growth discordance to improve outcomes. The results currently reported are not consistent due to the poor unified parameters and gestational durations.\nA total of 71 dichorionic twins with growth discordance and 346 dichorionic twins with normal growth were respectively included in the retrospective cohort study. The weight discordance of more than 25% was defined as a \"growth discordant twin\". The clinical baseline information, maternal outcomes, twin birth weights and fetal growth parameters (which were measured by ultrasound) were compared between the two groups from early gestation to late gestation. Multiple logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves were adopted to evaluate the predictive value of the growth parameters.\nCompared with normal dichorionic twins, the clinical baseline conditions were similar in the twins those finally developed growth discordance. The fetal growth parameters and the deepest volume pocket of amniotic fluid in early and mid-pregnancy showed no obvious predictive values. The fetal growth parameters in late pregnancy showed predictive values, especially the discordance of estimated fetal weight (EFW) in the early third-trimester (P\u2009<\u20090.001, area under the curve, 0.822; the cut-off value, 20%; sensitivity, 66.67%; specificity, 91.30%; positive predictive value, 88.46%).\nTwo assessment approaches were suggested and adopted to predict twin growth discordance in the current study. Twin growth should be assessed longitudinally and dynamically. Normal twins may show growth imbalance in the early stage. The discordance of EFW in late pregnancy may be a useful indicator for a growth discordance of more than 25%, which is required further confirmation.",

    "abstract": "We analysed Natality data obtained from the National Vital Statistics System from 1971 through 2018. Overall, the rates of singletons declined among all racial groups over the five decades of the study. However, the rates of twins and higher-order multiples increased over the same period although for the past two decades, the rates of higher-order multiples had substantially plummeted. The global health implication of these findings is that policy changes in the US in the form of professional practice guidelines have succeeded in reducing the birth of vulnerable populations (i.e., higher-order multiples) who are predominantly created using assisted reproductive technology.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twin is a rarely seen congenital anomaly associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The most common types of conjoined twins are thoracopagus. Conjoined twins are either symmetrical twins or asymmetrical or heteropagus. This report records the successful separation of 2 cases of asymmetrical twins and one symmetrical twin with fused livers and diaphragm and communicating peritoneal cavities.\nThis study amended and strictly followed the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki declaration, our study included 4 case reports on conjoined twins (CT), 2 male and three female patients; 3 of them were parasitic and one was conjoined. We operated upon 2 parasitics and one conjoined. The 1st case died preoperatively.\nFour living children is our result.\nAs connections between the bowel and bone of the parasite and the respective organs in the autosite are often absent, the parasite could be excised easily without any effect on the autosite. We recommend the separation of the parasite and the autosite as early as possible. In many cases, surgery results in the death of one or both of the conjoined twins, particularly if they are joined at the head or share a vital organ. Our separated twins are yet the youngest living separated twins.\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03388684.",

    "abstract": "Although low birthweight (bw) and unfavorable intrauterine conditions have been associated with metabolic sequelae in later life, little is known about their impact on steroid metabolism. We studied genetically identical twins with intra-twin bw-differences from birth to adolescence to analyze the long-term impact of bw on steroid metabolism.\n68 monozygotic twin pairs with a bw-difference of <1 standard deviation score (SDS; concordant; n\u2005=\u200541) and \u22651 SDS (discordant; n\u2005=\u200527) were recruited. At 14.9 years (mean age), morning urine samples were collected and analyzed with gas chromatography-mass-spectrometry.\nNo significant differences were detected in the concordant group. In contrast, in the smaller twins of the discordant group, we found significantly higher concentrations not only of the dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) metabolite 16\u03b1-OH-DHEA (P\u2005=\u20050.001, 656.11 vs 465.82 \u00b5g/g creatinine) but also of cumulative dehydroepiandrosterone and downstream metabolites (P\u2005=\u20050.001, 1650.22 vs 1131.92 \u00b5g/g creatinine). Relative adrenal (P\u2005=\u20050.002, 0.25 vs 0.18) and overall androgen production (P\u2005=\u20050.001, 0.79 vs 0.65) were significantly higher in the formerly smaller discordant twins. All twin pairs exhibited significant intra-twin correlations for all individual steroid metabolites, sums of metabolites, indicators of androgen production, and enzyme activities. Multiple regression analyses of the smaller twins showed that individual steroid concentrations of the larger co-twin were the strongest influencing factor among nearly all parameters analyzed.\nIn monozygotic twin pairs with greater intra-twin bw-differences (\u22651 SDS), we found that bw had a long-lasting impact on steroid metabolism, with significant differences regarding DHEAS metabolites and relative androgen production. However, most parameters showed significant intra-twin correlations, suggesting a consistent interrelationship between prenatal environment, genetic background, and steroid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic changes may result from the interplay of environmental exposures and genetic influences and contribute to differences in age-related disease, disability, and mortality risk. However, the etiologies contributing to stability and change in DNA methylation have rarely been examined longitudinally.\nWe considered DNA methylation in whole blood leukocyte DNA across a 10-year span in two samples of same-sex aging twins: (a) Swedish Adoption Twin Study of Aging (SATSA; N = 53 pairs, 53% female; 62.9 and 72.5 years, SD = 7.2 years); (b) Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins (LSADT; N = 43 pairs, 72% female, 76.2 and 86.1 years, SD=1.8 years). Joint biometrical analyses were conducted on 358,836 methylation probes in common. Bivariate twin models were fitted, adjusting for age, sex, and country.\nOverall, results suggest genetic contributions to DNA methylation across 358,836 sites tended to be small and lessen across 10 years (broad heritability M = 23.8% and 18.0%) but contributed to stability across time while person-specific factors explained emergent influences across the decade. Aging-specific sites identified from prior EWAS and methylation age clocks were more heritable than background sites. The 5037 sites that showed the greatest heritable/familial-environmental influences (p < 1E-07) were enriched for immune and inflammation pathways while 2020 low stability sites showed enrichment in stress-related pathways.\nAcross time, stability in methylation is primarily due to genetic contributions, while novel experiences and exposures contribute to methylation differences. Elevated genetic contributions at age-related methylation sites suggest that adaptions to aging and senescence may be differentially impacted by genetic background.",

    "abstract": "We investigated how the COVID-19 crisis and the extraordinary experience of lockdown affected young adults in England and Wales psychologically. One month after lockdown commenced (T2), we assessed 30 psychological and behavioural traits in 4,000 twins in their mid-twenties and compared their responses to the same traits assessed in 2018 (T1). Mean changes from T1 to T2 were modest and inconsistent: just as many changes were in a positive as negative direction. Twin analyses revealed that genetics accounted for about half of the reliable variance at T1 and T2. Genetic factors correlated on average .86 between T1 and T2 and accounted for over half of the phenotypic stability. Systematic environmental influences had negligible impact on T1, T2 or T2 change. Rather than the crisis fundamentally changing people psychologically, our results suggest that genetic differences between individuals play a fundamental role in shaping psychological and behavioural responses to the COVID-19 crisis.",

    "abstract": "The metaphysics of early embryos is a hotly debated topic in contemporary bioethics and metaphysics. Many contemporary Aristotelians believe that a human being is present from the moment of conception. At the same time, certain findings in modern embryology about the formation of identical twins challenge this belief. It becomes much harder when these theories are taken into account to understand the continued identity over time of the embryo(s) given the twinning process. In this article, I will consider the philosophical implications of two models of monozygotic twinning within an Aristotelian metaphysical schema one of which is the standard, or traditional, model. The other of which is a new model recently put forward by Herranz. For the sake of completeness, I will also consider the philosophical implications of chimeras for the Aristotelian position. I will explain how Aristotelians can understand the process of twinning while holding on to their belief that a human being is present from the moment of conception.\nI will argue that a human being is present from the moment of conception. I will argue for this on Aristotelian grounds, and I will then defend this claim from criticisms based on a number of findings in modern embryology.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To describe the concentration of total and specific IgG antibodies anti-Streptococcus B, anti-lipopolysaccharide of Klebsiella spp, and anti-lipopolysaccharide of Pseudomonas spp in the umbilical cord of newborn(NB) twins and to analyze the association between neonatal infection and antibody concentration in the umbilical cord blood. METHODS A prospective cross-sectional study of a cohort of NB twins admitted during the period of 20 months. Patients with malformations and mothers with infection were excluded. Variables analyzed: gestational age(GA); birth weight(BW); antibody concentrations in umbilical cord blood; infection episodes. We used the paired Student t-test, Spearman correlation, and generalized estimation equation. RESULTS 57 pairs of twins were included, 4 excluded, making the sample of 110 newborns. GA=36\u00b11.65weeks and BW=2304.8\u00b1460g(mean\u00b1SD). Antibody concentrations in twins(mean\u00b1SD): total IgG=835.71\u00b1190.73mg/dL, anti-StreptococcusB IgG=250.66\u00b1295.1 AU/mL, anti-lipopolysaccharide of Pseudomonas spp IgG=280.04\u00b1498.66 AU/mL and anti-lipopolysaccharide of Klebsiella spp IgG=504.75\u00b1933.93 AU/mL. There was a positive correlation between maternal antibody levels and those observed in newborns(p <0.005). The transplacental transfer of maternal total IgG and anti-LPS Pseudomonas IgG antibodies was significantly lower at NB GA <34 weeks(p <0.05). Five newborns were diagnosed with an infection. Infants with infection had significantly lower total IgG concentration(p <0.05). CONCLUSION This study showed a positive correlation between maternal and newborn antibodies levels. In infants younger than 34 weeks there is less transfer of total IgG and anti-LPS Pseudomonas IgG. The highest incidence of infection in the newborn group who had significantly lower total IgG serum antibodies reinforces the importance of anti-infectious protection afforded by passive immunity transferred from the mother.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in the metabolic profile and body composition of monozygotic (MZ) twins concordant and discordant for the practice of physical exercise. The sample consisted of 92 MZ twins (72.5% female and 27.5% male, mean age 25.4 \u00b1 5.69 years), registered with the Brazilian Registry of Twins, residing in Natal, Brazil. Data collection was carried out between the years 2016 and 2018. On day 1, subjects underwent a whole-body fitness evaluation, including measures of weight, height, body composition by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry and the Cardiorespiratory Exercise Test. On day 2, 10 ml blood samples were collected (overnight fasting) to determine the lipid profile and fasting glucose. The sample was separated into three groups: Active Concordant twins (Concordant A, n = 44 subjects), Inactive Concordant twins (Concordant I, n = 22 subjects) and Discordant pairs for Physical Exercise (Discordant PE, n = 26 subjects). The results demonstrated a difference between the discordant twins for exercise and also between the active versus sedentary groups, indicating a causal effect of exercise on the fat percentage, maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) and second ventilatory threshold variables. Between groups, a difference was also observed between the groups in ventilatory threshold, very low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides. We concluded that, regardless of genetics, the practice of physical exercise was sufficient to generate alterations in body composition and VO2max in MZ twins, but not in the lipid profile or fasting glucose.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D supplementation is widely used. However, there is no consensus on the use and dosage of this supplement and the existing recommendations arise from studies based on the benefits that this nutrient can facilitate in bones. In addition, individual genetics can influence the response to supplementation, therefore, research involving monozygotic twins aims to reduce these differences in phenotypic responses. The objective of this randomised controlled study is to examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on body composition and the expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) mRNA. An intervention was performed through supplementation with cholecalciferol at the concentration of 2000\u00a0IU in 90 healthy adult monozygotic twins (male or female pairs) for 2\u00a0months. The findings showed that serum vitamin D concentration increased by 65% and VDR gene expression sixty times (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Changes in body composition parameters were observed regarding body fat and lean mass. Our results indicate that an increase in serum vitamin D concentration may have potential therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "Studies of twins can reduce confounding and provide additional evidence about the causes of disease, due to within-pair matching for measured and unmeasured factors. Although findings from twin studies are typically applicable to the general population, few studies have taken full advantage of the twin design to explore the developmental origins of cardiometabolic health outcomes. We aimed to systematically review the evidence from twin studies and generate pooled estimates for the effects of early-life risk factors on later-life cardiometabolic health.\nAn initial search was conducted in March 2018, with 55 studies of twins included in the review. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and eligible studies were included in a meta-analysis, where pooled estimates were calculated. Twenty-six studies analysed twins as individuals, and found that higher birthweight was associated with lower SBP (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-2.02\u00a0mmHg, 95%CI: -3.07, -0.97), higher BMI (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.52\u00a0kg/m\nEarly-life risk factors were associated with cardiometabolic health outcomes in twin studies. However, many estimates from studies in this review were likely to have been confounded by gestational age, and few fully exploited the twin design to assess the developmental origins of cardiometabolic health outcomes.",

Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels that are higher than optimal, even if below the diagnostic threshold of diabetes, can also lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Here we intend to study the magnitude of the genetic influence on FPG variation by conducting structural equation modelling analysis and to further identify specific genetic variants potentially related to FPG levels by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Chinese twins.\nThe final sample included 382 twin pairs: 139 dizygotic (DZ) pairs and 243 monozygotic (MZ) pairs.

    "abstract": "A conclusion of the European Fertility Project in 1986 was that pretransition populations mostly displayed natural fertility, where parity-dependent birth control was absent. This conclusion has recently been challenged for England by new empirical results and has also been widely rejected by theorists of long-run economic growth, where pre-industrial fertility control is integral to most models. In this study, we use the accident of twin births to show that for three Western European-derived pre-industrial populations-namely, England (1730-1879), France (1670-1788), and Qu\u00e9bec (1621-1835)-we find no evidence for parity-dependent control of marital fertility. If a twin was born in any of these populations, family size increased by 1 compared with families with a singleton birth at the same parity and mother age, with no reduction of subsequent fertility. Numbers of children surviving to age 14 also increased. Twin births also show no differential effect on fertility when they occurred at high parities; this finding is in contrast to populations where fertility is known to have been controlled by at least some families, such as in England, 1900-1949, where a twin birth increased average births per family by significantly less than 1.",

    "abstract": "The calcium binding protein S100B and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are both biomarkers implicated in neuronal processes in the central nervous system and seem to be associated with affective disorders. Here we investigated both markers in a sample of monozygotic (MZ) twins with, at risk of and without affective disorders, aiming to evaluate whether these markers have a role as causal factors- or trait markers for affective disorders.\nWe measured serum S100B and plasma BDNF levels in 204 monozygotic twins (MZ) with unipolar or bipolar disorder in remission or partial remission (affected), their unaffected co-twins (high-risk) and twins with no personal or family history of affective disorder (low-risk).\nNo significant group differences in S100B and BDNF levels were found between the three groups. Exploratory analysis revealed that higher S100B levels were correlated with lower cognitive performance.\nThe cross-sectional design cannot elucidate the two neuronal biomarkers role as causal factors. We would have preferred a higher sample size in the high- and low-risk groups.\nThe present result did not support a role for S100B and BDNF as neither causal factors nor trait markers for affective disorders. Elevated S100B levels may associate with impaired cognition, but further studies are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Losing a co-twin by death is a severely stressful event yet with unknown impact on the surviving twin's risk of psychiatric disorders. We identified all Swedish-born twins who lost a co-twin by death between 1973 and 2013 (n = 4,528), their 4939 non-twin full siblings, together with 22,640 age- and sex-matched non-bereaved twins. Compared to the non-bereaved twins, exposed twins were at increased risk of receiving a first diagnosis of psychiatric disorders (hazard ratio = 1.65, 95% confidence interval1.48-1.83), particularly during the first month after loss. Similarly, compared to non-twin full siblings, the relative risks were significantly increased after loss of monozygotic co-twin (2.45-fold), and loss of a dizygotic co-twin (1.29-fold), with higher HR observed with greater age gaps between twins and non-twin siblings. As dizygotic twins share equal genetic relatedness to the deceased twin as their full siblings, this pattern suggests that beyond the contribution of genetic factors, shared early life experiences and attachment contribute to the risk of psychiatric disorders among surviving twins after co-twin loss.",

    "abstract": "Esophageal atresia with/without tracheo-esophageal fistula (EA/TEF) is more common among twins. The detection of polyhydramnios might be altered in twins, leading to EA/TEF underdiagnosis, prenatally. The aim of the study was to compare the prenatal manifestation of EA/TEF between twins and singletons.\nA 12-year study of EA/TEF cases was performed at a tertiary center. Cases exhibiting (a) small/absent stomach or (b) polyhydramnios were considered \"suspected\"; cases with (c) esophageal pouch were considered \"detected.\" We compared the rate and timing of appearance of these signs between the groups.\nThere were 76 cases of EA/TEF, of which 17 were a co-twin. All twin pairs were EA/TEF discordant. The prevalence of EA/TEF at our center was 1:750 for twins (1:319 monochorionic and 1:1133 dichorionic) and 1:2399 for singletons. The rate of small/absent stomach, polyhydramnios and pouch in twins vs singletons was 23.5%, 47.1%, 29.4% and 39.7%, 72.4%,34.5%, respectively (P =\u2009.2, P =\u2009.09 and P =\u2009.7). Esophageal pouch was detected earlier in twins (P =\u2009.03). Twins were scanned more frequently (\u00d71.8 times, P =\u2009.01).\nEA/TEF is more prevalent in twins. Despite lower rate of polyhydramnios, twins were similarly detected prenatally as singletons, and this was accomplished earlier in pregnancy; perhaps reflecting more frequent scans.",

    "abstract": "One of Nick's key early achievements at QIMR was to establish a twin study on melanoma risk factors. The Brisbane Twin Nevus Study (BTNS) had an initial focus on nevus (mole) count in adolescents but, reflecting Nick's broad interests, expanded in scope enormously over the decades. In the skin cancer arena, BTNS was essential to genetic discoveries in melanoma, eye color and pigmentation. Later studies amassed data on thousands of phenotypes, ranging from molecular phenotypes such as gene expression to studies where gene mapping findings in adolescents turned out to have translational potential in late-onset diseases. Nick's twin data have formed the basis for an enormous range of discoveries, with Nick and his colleagues continuing to capitalize on these data.",

    "abstract": "Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare, autosomal dominant disease that leads to premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Since monozygotic twins share the intrauterine environment and have the same age and gene profile, they could represent a very special resource for the investigation of the causes and the natural course of FH. This report is a description of 36-year-old monozygotic twin brothers with almost identical early coronary artery involvement due to FH concomitant with high lipoprotein(a) (Lpa) levels and a review of the literature. Sequence analysis revealed that the twins were homozygous for the LDLR c.1060+10G>A (rs12710260) mutation and heterozygous for the LDLR c.542C>T (rs557344672) mutations. Both were also homozygous for the c.1060+7T>C (rs2738442) and c.1586+53A>G (rs1569372) mutations in the LDLR gene as well as c.4265A>T (rs568413) mutations in the APOB gene. In the literature, there are 7 twin cases with reported FH, but none with high Lpa levels. The HoFH twins in this case report had lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels than expected (before treatment 204 and 223 mg/dL), with almost identical coronary involvement. Both had an extremely high Lpa level (308 and 272 nmol/L) with a very low coronary calcium score (16 AU) and a good response to statins (>60%). There was a history of the first CVD event occurring at nearly the same age (32-34 years) in the family. This could be an important aspect of FH families as a result of the similar timing of cumulative LDL exposure exceeding the threshold of CVD events. In conclusion, this first report of monozygotic HoFH twins with elevated Lpa levels and almost identical early coronary artery involvement at the same age provides evidence to substantiate the hypothesis of lifetime cholesterol burden/exposure.",

    "abstract": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an overgrowth disorder caused by defects at the 11p15.5 imprinted region. Many cases of female monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for BWS have been reported, but no definitive conclusions have been drawn regarding the link between epigenetic defects, twinning process, and gender. Here, we report a comprehensive characterization and follow-up of female MZ twins discordant for BWS.\nMethylation pattern at 11p15.5 and multilocus methylation disturbance (MLID) profiling were performed by pyrosequencing and MassARRAY in placental/umbilical cord samples and postnatal tissues. Whole-exome sequencing was carried out to identify MLID causative mutations. X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) was determined by HUMARA test.\nBoth twins share KCNQ1OT1:TSS-DMR loss of methylation (LOM) and MLID in blood and the epigenetic defect remained stable in the healthy twin over time. KCNQ1OT1:TSS-DMRLOM was nonhomogeneously distributed in placental samples and the twins showed the same severely skewed XCI pattern. No MLID-causative mutations were identified.\nThis is the first report on BWS-discordant twins with methylation analyses extended to extraembryonic tissues. The results suggest that caution is required when attempting prenatal diagnosis in similar cases. Although the causative mechanism underlying LOM remains undiscovered, the XCI pattern and mosaic LOM suggest that both twinning and LOM/MLID occurred after XCI commitment.",

    "abstract": "There are still some controversies regarding the risks and benefits of fetal reduction from twins to singletons. We aimed to evaluate if fetal reduction from twins to singleton improves pregnancy outcome.\nRetrospective analysis of all dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies, who underwent fetal reduction. Pregnancy outcome was compared to ongoing, non-reduced, dichorionic-diamniotic gestations. Primary outcome was preterm birth prior to 37 gestational weeks. Secondary outcomes included: preterm birth prior to 34 gestational weeks, gestational age at delivery, birthweight, small for gestational age, hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes and stillbirth.\nNinety-eight reduced pregnancies were compared with 222 ongoing twins. Preterm birth <\u200937 gestational weeks (39.6% vs. 57.6%, p\u00a0<\u20090.001) was significantly lower in the reduced group compared to the ongoing twins' group. A multivariate analysis, controlling for parity and mode of conception, demonstrated that fetal reduction independently and significantly reduced the risk for prematurity (aOR 0.495, 95% CI -0.299-0.819). Subgroup analysis, similarly adjusted demonstrated lower rates of preterm delivery in those undergoing elective reduction (aOR\u2009=\u20090.206, 95% CI 0.065-0.651), reduction due to fetal anomalies (aOR\u2009=\u20090.522, 95% CI 0.295-0.926) and 1st trimester reduction (aOR\u2009=\u20090.297, 95% Cl 0.131-0.674) all compared to ongoing twins. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed a significant proportion of non-delivered women at each gestational week in the reduced group compared to non-reduced twins, after 29 gestational weeks.\nFetal reduction from twins to singleton reduces the risk of preterm birth <\u200937 gestational weeks, but not for more severe maternal and perinatal complications.",

Preterm birth <\u200937 gestational weeks (39.6% vs. 57.6%, p\u00a0<\u20090.001) was significantly lower in the reduced group compared to the ongoing twins' group. A multivariate analysis, controlling for parity and mode of conception, demonstrated that fetal reduction independently and significantly reduced the risk for prematurity (aOR 0.495, 95% CI -0.299-0.819). Subgroup analysis, similarly adjusted demonstrated lower rates of preterm delivery in those undergoing elective reduction (aOR\u2009=\u20090.206, 95% CI 0.065-0.651), reduction due to fetal anomalies (aOR\u2009=\u20090.522, 95% CI 0.295-0.926) and 1st trimester reduction (aOR\u2009=\u20090.297, 95% Cl 0.131-0.674) all compared to ongoing twins. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed a significant proportion of non-delivered women at each gestational week in the reduced group compared to non-reduced twins, after 29 gestational weeks.",

    "abstract": "Unipolar and bipolar disorders aggregate in families and have been associated with a reduced gray-matter volume in hippocampal and prefrontal cortex. Here we used structural MRI to clarify whether abnormalities in hippocampal subfield and prefrontal cortical morphology are associated with familial vulnerability (i.e., changes present both in patients and unaffected relatives compared to healthy individuals), resilience (i.e., changes differentiating unaffected relatives and patients), or sequalae of illness in a sample of monozygotic twins. We investigated regional differences in gray-matter volume extracted using FreeSurfer 6.0 between remitted affected twins (AT) with either unipolar or bipolar disorder (n\u2009=\u200967), unaffected discordant co-twins (UT, n\u2009=\u200939), and low-risk twins (LT, n\u2009=\u200931) with no personal or first-degree family history of affective disorders. The UT showed greater bilateral hippocampal volumes compared to AT. Between group differences in left hippocampal volume were driven by greater cornu ammonis 1-3 and 4, subiculum and subfield of dentate gyrus. For the right hippocampus, differences were driven by greater hippocampal tail and subiculum. There was a trend for UT having a larger left hippocampus than LT, but no significant differences in hippocampal volumes between AT and LT. Outside the hippocampus, AT showed a smaller volume of left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex compared to LT. Our results suggest that larger volume of specific hippocampal subfields may be associated with resilience in healthy relatives of patients with an affective illness. Moreover, a smaller volume of left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex may reflect a sequalae of illness.",

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 carriers may have a larger deterioration in short-term cognitive function after major surgery compared with APOE \u03b54 noncarriers.\nThe aim was to examine the effect of APOE \u03b54 on the association between exposure to surgery and anaesthesia, and subsequent cognitive functioning. A more pronounced deterioration in cognitive function in APOE \u03b54 carriers was hypothesised.\nAn observational cross-sectional and a 6 to 10 years longitudinal twin cohort design.\nSurvey and register study of 2936 Danish twins aged 45 to 92 years.\nCognitive function was assessed using five age-sensitive cognitive tests. In the cross-sectional study, we compared twins exposed to surgery with a reference group (unexposed). Linear regression models were used adjusting for sex and age and stratified by APOE \u03b54 carrier status. In the longitudinal cognitive follow-up study 1671 twins participated. Intrapair analyses were also performed using 70 same-sexed twin pairs concordant for APOE \u03b54 carrier status, but discordant for major surgery.\nAPOE \u03b54 carriers had lower cognitive scores compared with noncarriers, and this was statistically significant in elderly twins 70+ years of age (mean difference, -0.67; 95% CI, -1.14 to -0.17). There was no significant impact on cognitive function after surgery according to APOE \u03b54 carrier status in the cross-sectional study. Similarly, there was no APOE \u03b54 modification in the longitudinal study. Also, in the intrapair analyses no evidence was found of lower cognitive score after major surgery compared with the nonexposed cotwins among APOE \u03b54 carriers.\nNo evidence was found of more pronounced long-term deterioration in cognitive function after surgery among APOE \u03b54 carriers, but elderly APOE \u03b54 carriers in general performed worse on the cognitive tests than noncarriers.",

    "abstract": "What impact does formal punishment have on antisocial conduct-does it deter or promote it? The findings from a long line of research on the labeling tradition indicate formal punishments have the opposite-of-intended consequence of promoting future misbehavior. In another body of work, the results show support for deterrence-based hypotheses that punishment deters future misbehavior. So, which is it? We draw on a nationally representative sample of British adolescent twins from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study to perform a robust test of the deterrence versus labeling question. We leverage a powerful research design in which twins can serve as the counterfactual for their co-twin, thereby ruling out many sources of confounding that have likely impacted prior studies. The pattern of findings provides support for labeling theory, showing that contact with the justice system-through spending a night in jail/prison, being issued an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO), or having an official record-promotes delinquency. We conclude by discussing the impact these findings may have on criminologists' and practitioners' perspective on the role of the juvenile justice system in society.",

    "abstract": "Due to the special circumstances and the pre-natal environment in twin gestations, disruptions in the development of the embryo are more frequently observed in twin births as compared to singleton births. Twin research provides an excellent model to explore the etiology of disruptions in craniofacial biology. Mirror imaging (MI) is a special manifestation of twinning, and the elucidation of the etiology of this phenomenon is important to understand the biological mechanisms which underlie congenital defects, like orofacial clefts, and to provide insight into left-right asymmetry. The aim of this paper was, therefore, to present 3 pairs of Turkish monozygotic (MZ) twins with MI dental features, and to contribute to the knowledge of the MI phenomenon in the literature. We examined 2 male and 1 female MZ twin pairs clinically and radiographically in terms of their MI features. Mirrorimage features in dental and other ectodermal structures were detected in all the twins. Understanding the biological mechanisms of MI provides broad insight into preventive measures and treatment protocols. Furthermore, the presence of MI features may lead to the detection of other MI pathologies in twins.",

    "abstract": "Kearns-Sayre Syndrome (KSS) is a severe mitochondrial disorder involving the central nervous system, eyes, ears, skeletal muscles, and heart. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) rearrangements, especially the deletions, are present in almost all KSS patients and considered as the disease-causing factor. However, the size and position of mtDNA deletions are distinct in different individuals. In this study, we report the case of a pair of Chinese twins with KSS. The twin patients revealed typical KSS clinical symptoms, including heart block, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, progressive external ophthalmoplegia, exercise intolerance, proximal limb weakness, and endocrine disorders. Using long-range polymerase chain reactions (long-range PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), the genetic features of the twin patients were investigated. A large 6600\u2009bp mtDNA deletion, ranging from position 8702 to 15,302, was detected in both patients. To our knowledge, this kind of mtDNA deletion has never been described previously. Our study enriched the mutation spectrum of KSS and showed that NGS is a powerful tool for detecting mtDNA large variants.",

    "abstract": "Twinning is a known accommodation mechanism of graphene that results in low-energy microstructures or twins. In view of their mechanical stability, twins suggest themselves as a possible means of introducing extended defects in graphene leading to the opening of transmission band gaps. We investigate charge-carrier transmission across the twin structures in graphene using the Landauer-B\u00fcttiker (LB) formalism in combination with a tight-binding model. We verify the approach by means of selected comparisons with density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations using the code SIESTA and TRANSIESTA. The calculations reveal that graphene twins open transport gaps depending on the twin geometry up to maximum of 1.15 eV. As previously reported for grain boundaries, we find that localized states arise at dislocation cores in the twin boundaries that introduce peaks near the Fermi level.",

    "abstract": "The current literature regarding the recommended mode of delivery of monochorionic-diamniotic twins is limited to small numbers, retrospective studies, and comparisons of outcomes of monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies with those of dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies instead of outcomes of trial of labor vs elective cesarean delivery of monochorionic-diamniotic twins.\nThis study aimed to compare perinatal and maternal outcomes of planned cesarean delivery and planned vaginal delivery of monochorionic-diamniotic twins using the Twin Birth Study data.\nThis study is a secondary analysis of the Twin Birth Study. Women were randomized from 32 weeks and 0 days gestation to 38 weeks and 6 days gestation to planned cesarean delivery or planned vaginal delivery. Twin A in the cephalic presentation and estimated weight of each twin between 1500 and 4000 grams were the inclusion criteria. Pregnancies complicated by fetal reduction after 13 weeks of gestation, lethal fetal anomaly, or contraindication to vaginal delivery were excluded. Elective delivery was planned between 37 weeks and 5 to 7 days of gestation and 38 weeks and 6 to 7 days of gestation. Perinatal and maternal outcomes of monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies were compared between those randomized for planned cesarean delivery and those randomized for planned vaginal delivery. In addition, outcomes of monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies were compared with those of dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies.\nOut of the 1393 women in each arm, 346 (24.9%) women in the planned cesarean delivery arm and 324 (23.3%) women in the planned vaginal delivery arm had monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies and were eligible for the first analysis. The rate of cesarean delivery was 39.2% in the planned vaginal delivery arm and was 91.3% in the planned cesarean delivery arm. There was no significant difference in gestational age at delivery between the groups (34.4\u00b11.8 weeks vs 34.5\u00b11.8 weeks; P=.78). No difference was found in maternal outcomes. As for perinatal outcomes, the rate of the primary adverse neonatal composite outcomes in twins A or twins B was similar in both the planned vaginal delivery and the planned cesarean delivery arms (twins A, 1.2% vs 1.2% [P=.92]; twins B, 1.2% vs 3.2% [P=.09]). Within the planned cesarean delivery arm, the rate of primary adverse neonatal composite outcome was higher in twins B than twins A (3.2% vs 1.2%; P=.03). There was no difference in the primary adverse neonatal composite outcome between twins A in the monochorionic-diamniotic group and the dichorionic-diamniotic group (1.2% vs 1.3%; P=.89) or between twins B in similar groups (2.3% vs 2.7%; P=.47).\nIn monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancy between 32 weeks and 0 to 7 days of gestation and 38 weeks and 6 to 7 days of gestation, with twin A in a cephalic presentation, planned cesarean delivery did not decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal morbidity, as compared with planned vaginal delivery.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins with 45,X/46,XY mosaicism, discordant for phenotypic sex, are extremely rare.\nThis report describes the clinical findings of a rare case of 45,X/46,XY mosaicism in monozygotic twins with different external genitalia. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis, performed by collecting DNA from each umbilical cord, showed identical SNPs in the autosomal chromosomes of both fetuses.\nChorionic villus sampling of a 37-year-old primigravida carrying monozygotic twins revealed a 45,X/46,XY karyotype. Autopsy of the aborted fetuses revealed a penis and testes on one fetus and a vagina, uterus, and ovaries in the other fetus--which also had severe cystic hygroma. Cell counting using fluorescence in situ hybridization with XY probes (XY-FISH) showed 20% and 80% abundance of 45,X cells in the internal genitalia, liver, heart, lung, adrenal gland, bone marrow, and spine of the male and female fetuses, respectively.\nThese results indicated that the fetuses were genetically monozygotic twins and their different degrees of mosaicism may have resulted in different genital phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twinning involves numerous maternal and fetal complications, triplets complicated by a monochorionic pair are at further increased risk. Here, we report a case of repeated triplets complicated by monochorionic diamniotic twins with successful pregnancy outcomes in a woman using autologous oocytes.\nA 30-year-old female undergoing embryo transfer with fresh and frozen embryo cycles with autologous oocytes. The two cycles were confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound to result in successful clinical pregnancies of triplets complicated by a monochorionic twinning. The first pregnancy resulted in a singleton delivery after a selective reduction of the monochorionic pair. The subsequent pregnancy resulted in a dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy after the heartbeat of one of the monochorionic twin fetuses stopped at 43\u2009days after embryo transfer. Both of the pregnancies ended with successful live births.\nOur case report of repeated triplets with monochorionic twins suggests the potential causes and risk factors of monochorionic twinning in assisted reproduction and raises concern regarding the timing of multifetal pregnancy reduction.",

    "abstract": "Published findings on perinatal outcomes of multifetal pregnancy reduction (MPR) of dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twin pregnancy to singleton are controversial. We performed a meta-analysis to appraise the effects of MPR of DCDA twin pregnancy versus expectant management on perinatal outcomes.\nFour electronic databases were searched from their inception to June 15, 2019, to identify publications that appraised MPR before 15 weeks of gestation. Studies reporting perinatal outcomes of both MPR of DCDA twin pregnancy to singleton and expectant management were considered. The relative risks (RRs) and mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model.\nSix studies involving 7398 participants showed that MPR of DCDA twin pregnancy to singleton was associated with a lower risk of preterm birth (5 studies with 7297 participants; RR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.22-0.40; P\u200a<\u200a.001) and higher birth weight (4 studies with 5763 participants; mean differences: 548.10\u200ag, 95% CI: 424.04-672.15; P\u200a<\u200a.001) than expectant management; there was no difference in the occurrence of miscarriages (5 studies with 7355 participants; RR: 1.57, 95% CI: 0.90-2.75; P\u200a=\u200a.11). Sensitivity analysis showed that all the results were stable and reliable, with the omission of 2 studies with serious risk of bias.\nCompared to expectant management, MPR of DCDA twin pregnancy to singleton prevents preterm birth and low birth weight, without increasing the risk of miscarriages. Regarding perinatal morbidity related to preterm birth, MPR can be reserved as a remediation measure to improve the perinatal outcomes of DCDA twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Exercise is considered medicine; however, the individual degree of responsiveness to a standardized dose of exercise is idiosyncratic. Individual responsiveness between distinct exercise modalities and the genetic/environmental contributions to exercise response are not well understood. In this novel randomized cross-over design study, monozygotic and dizygotic twins, as pairs, underwent 3 months of resistance and endurance training, separated by a 3 month washout period, aiming to assess training responses in strength and fitness outcomes to dichotomous training modalities, as well as the genetic/environmental contributions to exercise response. Our findings indicate that (i) individual responsiveness differs between exercise modalities; (ii) low-responders to one mode may be 'rescued' by switching to an alternate mode of exercise; and (iii) genes may not play as large a role, as previously estimated from cross-sectional data, for exercise training adaptation. The present study has implications for those charged with optimizing the benefits of exercise by means of individualizing the exercise prescription.\nExercise response is idiosyncratic, although the degree of responsiveness, concordance in response between modalities and genetic contribution to responsiveness are not well understood. We investigated this using a novel randomized cross-over design of dichotomous exercise interventions in mono-(MZ) and di-zygotic (DZ) twin pairs. We studied strength (1RM) and fitness ( ",

    "abstract": "Does having a male co-twin influence the female twin's reproductive outcomes?\nWomen with a male co-twin had the same chances of being pregnant and having children compared to same-sex twin pairs.\nAccording to the twin testosterone transfer (TTT) hypothesis, in an opposite-sex twin pregnancy, testosterone transfer from the male to the female co-twin occurs. A large body of literature supports the negative impact of prenatal testosterone exposure on female's reproductive health in animal models; however, evidence from human studies remains controversial.\nThis cohort study included all dizygotic female twins in the Aberdeen Maternity and Neonatal Databank (Scotland) born before 1 January 1979. The 317 eligible women were followed up for 40 years for any pregnancies and the outcome of those pregnancies recorded in the same database.\nFertility outcomes (number of pregnancies, number of livebirths and age at first pregnancy) were compared between women with a male co-twin (exposed group, n\u2009=\u2009151) and those with a female co-twin (unexposed group, n\u2009=\u2009166). Population averaged models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI for all outcomes with adjusting for potential confounders.\nThere were no differences in chances of having pregnancies (adj. OR 1.33; 95% CI 0.72, 2.45) and livebirths (adj. OR 1.22; 95% CI 0.68, 2.18) between women from same-sex and opposite-sex twin pairs. Women with a male co-twin were more likely to smoke during pregnancy and, in the unadjusted model, were younger at their first pregnancy (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.21, 3.75). After adjusting for confounding variables (year of birth and smoking status) the latter finding was no longer significant (OR 1.67; 95% CI 0.90, 3.20).\nThe dataset was relatively small. For women without a pregnancy recorded in the databank, we assumed that they had not been pregnant.\nDespite the evidence from animal studies concerning the adverse effects of prenatal testosterone exposure on female health, our results do not support the TTT hypothesis. The finding that women with a male co-twin are more likely to smoke during pregnancy highlights the importance of considering post-socialisation and social effects in twin studies.\nEuropean Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie project PROTECTED (grant agreement No. 722634) and FREIA project (grant agreement No. 825100).

    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel self-learning digital twin strategy is developed for fluid sloshing phenomena. This class of problems is of utmost importance for robotic manipulation of fluids, for instance, or, in general, in simulation-assisted decision making. The proposed method infers the (linear or non-linear) constitutive behavior of the fluid from video sequences of the sloshing phenomena. Real-time prediction of the fluid response is obtained from a reduced order model (ROM) constructed by means of thermodynamics-informed data-driven learning. From these data, we aim to predict the future response of a twin fluid reacting to the movement of the real container. The constructed system is able to perform accurate forecasts of its future reactions to the movements of the containers. The system is completed with augmented reality techniques, so as to enable comparisons among the predicted result with the actual response of the same liquid and to provide the user with insightful information about the physics taking place.",

    "abstract": "To explore the cytidine-phosphate-guanosine (CPG) sites associated with fas-ting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in twins.\nIn the study, 169 pairs of monozygotic twins were recruited in Qingdao, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Sichuan and Heilongjiang in June to December of 2013 and June 2017 to October 2018. The methylation was detected by Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip and Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. According to the Linear Mixed Effect model (LME model), fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c were taken as the main effects, the methylation level (\u03b2 value) was taken as the dependent variable, continuous variables, such as age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, components of blood cells, surrogate variables generated by SVA, and categorical variables, such as gender, smoking and drinking status, hypoglycemic drugs taking, were included in the fixed effect model as covariates, and the identity numbers (ID) of the twins was included in the random effect model. The intercept was set as a random. Regression analysis was carried out to find out the CpG sites related to fasting blood glucose or HbA1c, respectively.\nIn this study, 338 monozygotic twins (169 pairs) were included, with 412 459 CpG loci. Among them, 114 pairs were male, and 55 pairs were female, with an average age of (48.2\u00b111.9) years. After adjustment of age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, smoking, drinking, blood cell composition, and other covariates, and multiple comparison test, 7 CpG sites (cg19693031, cg01538969, cg08501915, cg04816311, ch.8.1820050F, cg06721411, cg26608667) were found related to fasting blood glucose, 3 of which (cg08501915, ch.8.1820050f, cg26608667) were the newly found sites in this study; whereas 10 CpG sites (cg19693031, cg04816311, cg01538969, cg01339781, cg01676795, cg24667115, cg09029192, cg20697417, ch.4.1528651F, cg16097041) were found related to HbA1c, and 4 of which(cg01339781, cg24667115, cg20697417, and ch.4.1528651f) were new. We found that cg19693031 in \nIn this twin study, we found new CpG sites related to fasting blood glucose and HbA1c, and provided some clues that partly revealed the potential mechanism of blood glucose metabolism in terms of DNA methylation, but it needed further verification in external larger samples.\n\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u751f\u5b50\u4eba\u7fa4\u5206\u522b\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u7a7a\u8179\u8840\u7cd6(fasting plasma glucose,FPG)\u6216\u7cd6\u5316\u8840\u7ea2\u86cb\u767d(glycated haemoglobin, HbA1c)\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u80de\u5627\u5576-\u78f7\u9178-\u9e1f\u560c\u5464(cytidine-phosphate-guanosine site,CpG)\u4f4d\u70b9\u3002\n\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\u6765\u81ea\u4e2d\u56fd\u53cc\u751f\u5b50\u767b\u8bb0\u7cfb\u7edf2013\u5e746\u6708\u81f312\u6708\u548c2017\u5e746\u6708\u81f32018\u5e7410\u6708\u4e8e\u5c71\u4e1c\u9752\u5c9b\u3001\u6d59\u6c5f\u3001\u6c5f\u82cf\u3001\u56db\u5ddd\u53ca\u9ed1\u9f99\u6c5f\u4e94\u5730\u52df\u96c6\u7684338\u4eba(169\u5bf9)\u540c\u5375\u53cc\u751f\u5b50\u3002\u7532\u57fa\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u522b\u4e3aIllumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip\u548cIllumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip\u4e24\u79cd\u82af\u7247,\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b,\u5206\u522b\u5c06\u7a7a\u8179\u8840\u7cd6\u53caHbA1c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u6548\u5e94,\u5c06\u7532\u57fa\u5316\u6c34\u5e73(\u03b2\u503c)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56e0\u53d8\u91cf,\u5c06\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u4f53\u91cd\u6307\u6570(body mass index, BMI)\u3001\u8840\u538b\u3001\u8840\u7ec6\u80de\u7ec4\u6210\u6210\u5206\u3001\u7528SVA\u5305\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u7b49\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf,\u53ca\u6027\u522b\u3001\u5438\u70df\u3001\u996e\u9152\u3001\u662f\u5426\u670d\u7528\u964d\u7cd6\u836f\u7b49\u5206\u7c7b\u53d8\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u7eb3\u5165\u56fa\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b,\u5c06\u53cc\u751f\u5b50\u5bf9\u7f16\u53f7\u7eb3\u5165\u968f\u673a\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b,\u5c06\u622a\u8ddd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a\u968f\u673a,\u8fdb\u884c\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790,\u627e\u51fa\u5206\u522b\u4e0e\u7a7a\u8179\u8840\u7cd6\u6216HbA1c\u76f8\u5173\u7684CpG\u4f4d\u70b9\u3002\n\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6700\u7ec8\u7eb3\u5165\u540c\u5375\u53cc\u751f\u5b50338\u4eba(169\u5bf9),CpG\u4f4d\u70b9412 459\u4e2a,\u5176\u4e2d\u7537\u6027\u540c\u5375\u53cc\u751f\u5b50114\u5bf9\u3001\u5973\u602755\u5bf9,\u5e73\u5747\u5e74\u9f84(48.2\u00b111.9)\u5c81\u3002\u5728\u8c03\u6574\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001BMI\u3001\u8840\u538b\u3001\u5438\u70df\u3001\u996e\u9152\u3001\u8840\u7ec6\u80de\u6210\u5206\u7b49\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u53ca\u591a\u91cd\u6bd4\u8f83\u6821\u6b63\u540e,\u53d1\u73b07\u4e2a\u4e0e\u7a7a\u8179\u8840\u7cd6\u76f8\u5173\u7684CpG\u4f4d\u70b9(cg19693031\u3001cg01538969\u3001cg08501915\u3001cg04816311\u3001ch.8.1820050F\u3001cg06721411\u3001cg26608667), \u5176\u4e2d3\u4e2a\u4f4d\u70b9(cg08501915\u3001ch.8.1820050F\u3001cg26608667)\u4e3a\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u4f4d\u70b9;\u53d1\u73b010\u4e2a\u4e0eHbA1c\u76f8\u5173\u7684CpG\u4f4d\u70b9(cg19693031\u3001cg04816311\u3001cg01538969\u3001cg01339781\u3001cg01676795\u3001cg24667115\u3001cg09029192\u3001cg20697417\u3001ch.4.1528651F\u3001cg16097041),\u5176\u4e2d4\u4e2a\u4f4d\u70b9(cg01339781\u3001cg24667115\u3001cg20697417\u3001ch.4.1528651F)\u4e3a\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u4f4d\u70b9\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0,\u4f4d\u4e8e\n\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65e2\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u540c\u65f6,\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u751f\u5b50\u7684\u5929\u7136\u4f18\u52bf,\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u4e0e\u7a7a\u8179\u8840\u7cd6\u548cHbA1c\u76f8\u5173\u7684CpG\u4f4d\u70b9,\u4e3a\u8840\u7cd6\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u7684DNA\u7532\u57fa\u5316\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22,\u4f46\u5c1a\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002",

In this twin study, we investigated the phenotypic, genetic and environmental associations between a latent anxiety factor and three cardiovascular autonomic function factors: interbeat interval (IBI, time between heart beats), heart rate variability (HRV, overall fluctuation of heart-beat intervals) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS, efficiency in regulating blood pressure [BP]). Multivariate twin models were fit using data of female twins (N = 250) of the Twin Interdisciplinary Neuroticism Study (TWINS). A significant negative association was identified between latent anxiety and BRS factors (r = -.24, 95% CI [-.40, -.07]). Findings suggest that this relationship was mostly explained by correlated shared environmental influences, and there was no evidence for pleiotropic genetic or unique environmental effects. We also identified negative relationships between anxiety symptoms and HRV (r = -.17, 95% CI [-.34, .00]) and IBI factors (r = -.13, 95% CI [-.29, .04]), though these associations did not reach statistical significance. Findings implicate that higher anxiety scores are associated with decreased efficiency in short-term BP regulation, providing support for autonomic dysfunction with anxiety symptomatology. The baroreflex system may be a key mechanism underlying the anxiety-cardiovascular health relationship.",

    "abstract": "This article describes a 1930s case study series involving dizygotic female twin infants. The twins' development was evaluated following periods of intentionally restricted practice and minimal social stimulation. In the opinion of the author of the current article, the study is very unsettling and unacceptable, despite the lack of institutional review boards at that time. This discussion is followed by twin research reviews of recent papers concerning twin and non-twin intracytoplasmic sperm injection conceptions, the Emory University Twin Study of cardiac and brain functions, labor trials in multiple pregnancies after previous C-section delivery and cell-free DNA fetal fraction in twin pregnancies. The article concludes with news items of a twin survivor of Auschwitz, a situation in which twins traded places, the rare birth of identical twin foals, the novel delivery of co-twins in different decades and the Twins Ambulette Service.",

    "abstract": "Folie a deux is a rare syndrome characterized by induction of a delusion in a susceptible person in close proximity with an individual with known delusional disorder. We report a rare case of monozygotic twins with induced delusional disorder in one of the twins. The twins had experienced childhood trauma in the form of emotional neglect and physical abuse by the father. The primary case (Twin A) was diagnosed with delusional disorder and was treated with oral antipsychotic. The secondary case (Twin B) showed resolution of symptoms after separation from twin A. The case highlights the unique presentation of induced delusional symptoms in monozygotic twins and the close association between childhood trauma and psychosis.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of idiopathic membranous nephropathy is associated with autoantibodies, most often against the phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) and with genetic factors, especially those involving human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. Idiopathic membranous nephropathy is not a typical inherited Mendelian disorder. Reports of idiopathic membranous nephropathy in twins are rare. Herein, we report on two twin sisters diagnosed with PLA2R-associated idiopathic membranous nephropathy. We identified the HLA-DRB1*0301, HLA-DRB1*1501, and HLA-DQB1*0602 alleles in the twin sisters, which were reported as independent risk alleles for idiopathic membranous nephropathy in the Asian population. This case report provides novel evidence for the role of predisposing HLA alleles in the pathogenesis of idiopathic membranous nephropathy.",

    "abstract": "To learn more about the mechanisms of human dietary fat perception, 398 human twins rated fattiness and liking for six types of potato chips that differed in triglyceride content (2.5, 5, 10, and 15% corn oil); reliability estimates were obtained from a subset (n = 50) who did the task twice. Some chips also had a saturated long-chain fatty acid (hexadecanoic acid, 16:0) added (0.2%) to evaluate its effect on fattiness and liking. We computed the heritability of these measures and conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify regions of the genome that co-segregate with fattiness and liking. Perceived fattiness and liking for the potato chips were reliable (r = 0.31-0.62, p < 0.05) and heritable (up to h2 = 0.29, p < 0.001, for liking). Adding hexadecanoic acid to the potato chips significantly increased ratings of fattiness but decreased liking. Twins with the G allele of rs263429 near GATA3-AS1 or the G allele of rs8103990 within ZNF729 reported more liking for potato chips than did twins with the other allele (multivariate GWAS, p < 1\u00d710-5), with results reaching genome-wide suggestive but not significance criteria. Person-to-person variation in the perception and liking of dietary fat was (a) negatively affected by the addition of a saturated fatty acid and (b) related to inborn genetic variants. These data suggest liking for dietary fat is not due solely to fatty acid content and highlight new candidate genes and proteins within this sensory pathway.",

It is associated with fat soluble vitamin D deficiency rickets and severe dyslipidemia; however, treatment of these secondary effects remains a challenge.\nOne year old twin males born to a mother with intrahepatic cholestasis during pregnancy presented with jaundice, pruritus and failure to thrive. Lab evaluation revealed significant transaminitis, direct hyperbilirubinemia and normal gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT). Genetic studies confirmed PFIC2. Further evaluation for fat soluble vitamin deficiencies revealed severe vitamin D deficiency rickets. High dose vitamin D replacement therapy using Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D\nHigher doses of Vitamin D therapy are needed for treatment of rickets secondary to cholestasis. Extremely low HDL-C levels are characteristic of PFIC\u00a0and improve with treatment of underlying cholestasis. Maternal intrahepatic cholestasis during pregnancy can be an early warning sign.",

    "abstract": "Biliary atresia (BA) in twins is extremely rare reported in the literature, but twin studies are useful methods of examining the associated factors of a complex disease. The objective of this study was to analyze the characteristics and patterns of biliary atresia in twins from reviewing available articles.\nPubMed and EMBASE databases were reviewed for related articles using the keywords ''biliary atresia'', ''twins'', ''monozygotic (MZ)'', and ''dizygotic (DZ)'', including relevant papers in the reference lists.\nThis analysis was extracted from 12 articles, with a total of 35 twin pairs included. BA was found in 36 out of 70 twin subjects (51.4%), of which had an even gender split. 97.1% twins were discordant, among 55.9% of which were monozygotic twin sets, indicating that BA may be related to genetic phenotype or penetrance. Isolated BA was the largest group with 27 (75%) affected twins. Only one pair of dizygotic twins (2.9%) demonstrate concordance for BA, and have one affected family member.\nBA was found in nearly half of twin subjects with an even gender split. Isolated BA was the largest group, in which the number of monozygotic twins was similar with dizygotic twins, so the onset of the disease may not associate with the zygosity of twins. Most of twin sets had discordant disease presentation, especially monozygotic twins therein, emphasizing the role of epigenetic factor in the pathogenesis of BA. Future studies should take genetic testing among any twin sets in BA, especially the disease-associated mutations, thus be useful to investigate the etiology of disease.",

Th17/IL-17 and Th9/IL-9 exhibit critical, but often opposing, roles in tumor progression. In this issue of the JCI, Salazar et al. show that while IL-17 and IL-9 induced distinct but complementary molecular pathways, both cytokines also induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung cancer cells and promoted metastatic spreading. A key question before us now is whether IL-9 and IL-17 contribute to tumor progression in a sequential and stage-specific manner within the tumor microenvironment.",

It is the first longitudinal twin project of its kind in Australia and comprises a sample of 2762 twin pairs, 40 triplet sets and 1485 nontwin siblings. Measures include standardized literacy and numeracy test data collected at Grades 3, 5, 7 and 9 as part of the National Assessment Program: Literacy and Numeracy. A range of demographic and behavioral data was also collected, some at multiple longitudinal time points. This article outlines the background and rationale for the study and provides an overview for the research design, sample and measures collected.

A New York City program that helped childless couples conceive via artificial insemination from the 1930s to the 1950s is examined as it related to these twins. The frequency with which pregnancies following assisted reproductive technology resulted in MZ twin pairs is also provided. Next, summaries of twin research concerning selective resuscitation, gene editing, sexual arousal and jejuno-ileal atresia are presented. The article ends with media reports of twin girls' efforts to find a bone marrow donor for their father, possible parasitic twinning in a puppy, identical female twins' business venture, the surgical separation of craniopagus twins, a twin-themed magazine cartoon and tragic events involving identical male twins.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) are attracting more and more attention due to their tissue regenerative properties and immunomodulatory functions. MSCs may be the most acceptable, safe, and effective source for allogeneic cell therapy, and have been used in medical treatment. However, the similarities and differences between umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) of heterosexual twins remain poorly understood. In this study, we compared the biological characteristics of UC-MSCs of heterosexual twins in vitro. We found that male fetal UC-MSCs and female fetal UC-MSCs share a similar phenotype and multi-lineage differentiation potential, and male fetal UC-MSCs show a significantly higher proliferation and adipogenic ability than female fetal UC-MSCs. UC-MSCs from heterosexual twins showed significant differences in the expression levels of NANOG, OCT4, TERT, and SOX2. In addition, male MSCs are more potent in the expression of inflammatory cytokines to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation. In future clinical applications using MSCs for inflammation-related diseases, these biological characteristics differences with different genders will guide our clinical methods.",

    "abstract": "To assess neonatal morbidity and mortality according to whether cephalic second twins were born after internal version followed by total breech extraction or after instructions to push. We hypothesized that interval version would result in shorter intertwin delivery intervals and lower cesarean delivery rates for the second twin and therefore better neonatal outcomes.\nThese planned analyses of the JUMODA (JUmeaux MODe d'Accouchement) cohort, a national prospective population-based study of twin deliveries, examined births of cephalic second twins after vaginal birth of the first twin at or after 32 weeks of gestation. The internal version group of second twins born in breech presentation after obstetric maneuvers was compared with the pushing group, comprising those born in cephalic presentation. The primary outcome was a composite of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Multivariate modified Poisson regression models were used to control for potential confounders.\nOf 2,256 cephalic second twins, 487 (21.6%) were born in breech presentation after internal version and total breech extraction and 1,769 (78.4%) in cephalic presentation after pushing. Composite neonatal morbidity and mortality was not lower in the internal version (17/487 [3.5%]) compared with the pushing group (38/1,769 [2.1%]; adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.73 [95% CI 0.98-3.05]), although median [quartile 1-quartile 3] intertwin delivery intervals were shorter (5 [4-8] vs 8 [5-12] minutes, P<.001) and the cesarean delivery rate for the second twin lower (5/487 [1.0%] vs 66/1,769 [3.7%], P=.002). Subgroup analyses showed no difference between groups at or after 37 weeks of gestation but higher composite neonatal morbidity and mortality after internal version before 37 weeks (14/215 [6.5%] vs 26/841 [3.1%]; aRR 2.18 [95% CI 1.15-4.13]). Secondary analyses according to center expertise in the overall population and stratified by gestational age yielded concordant results.\nAlthough our sample size precluded a robust assessment for small differences in outcomes between groups, internal version followed by total breech extraction of cephalic second twins was not associated with better neonatal outcomes than pushing.",

    "abstract": "To characterize the obstetric outcomes and placental pathology in live births arising from vanishing twin pregnancies compared with nonreduced in vitro fertilization (IVF) pregnancies.\nThis is a retrospective cohort study of live births resulting from fresh embryo transfers after IVF cycles with autologous oocytes from 2004 through 2017 at a large academic fertility center. Clinical information and pathology reports were reviewed. Placental diagnoses were coded using established nosology by expert placental pathologists. Analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson's \u03c7, and Fisher exact tests were used, as appropriate, to compare pathology categories between pregnancy outcomes. Mixed effects logistic regression models were generated to reveal the association between pregnancy outcome and placenta pathology, controlling for pregnancies arising in the same woman and various suspected confounders.\nOf 905 fresh autologous IVF cycles with placental pathology available for review, we identified 73 vanishing twin pregnancies (8.1%), 556 singleton pregnancies (61.4%), and 276 twin pregnancies (30.5%). Vanishing twin syndrome was not associated with preterm delivery, route of delivery, growth restriction or other obstetric outcomes as compared with IVF singleton pregnancies. However, vanishing twin syndrome pregnancies showed distinctive placental pathologies including an increased rate of small placentas (less than the 10th percentile by weight), with more anatomical abnormalities than IVF singleton pregnancies (odds ratio 1.73, 95% CI 0.94-3.19; adjusted odds ratio 2.15, 95% CI 1.08-4.28). The frequency of placental vascular and inflammatory pathologies associated with IVF vanishing twin syndrome pregnancies were similar to that of IVF singleton pregnancies. Loss of a twin after 8 weeks of gestation was not associated with greater risks of placental pathologies.\nIn vitro fertilization pregnancies affected by vanishing twin syndrome did not have significant differences in obstetric or perinatal outcomes as compared with twin or singleton gestations. However, early twin loss was potentially associated with differences in placental development associated with a higher rate of small placentas and other anatomic pathologies.",

Vanishing twin syndrome was not associated with preterm delivery, route of delivery, growth restriction or other obstetric outcomes as compared with IVF singleton pregnancies. However, vanishing twin syndrome pregnancies showed distinctive placental pathologies including an increased rate of small placentas (less than the 10th percentile by weight), with more anatomical abnormalities than IVF singleton pregnancies (odds ratio 1.73, 95% CI 0.94-3.19; adjusted odds ratio 2.15, 95% CI 1.08-4.28). The frequency of placental vascular and inflammatory pathologies associated with IVF vanishing twin syndrome pregnancies were similar to that of IVF singleton pregnancies. Loss of a twin after 8 weeks of gestation was not associated with greater risks of placental pathologies.",

    "abstract": "To estimate whether improvement in outcomes from antenatal corticosteroid treatment in extremely and very preterm twins is similar to that observed in singletons, and to investigate whether antenatal corticosteroid treatment has different effects according to chorionicity or birth order.\nThis population-based study was based on an analysis of data collected by the Neonatal Research Network of Japan from 2003 to 2015 of neonates weighing 1,500 g or less at birth, from gestational ages of 24 0/7 to 31 6/7 weeks of gestation. After propensity score matching, univariate logistic and interaction analyses were performed to compare short-term (neonatal period) and medium-term (3 years of age) outcomes of the children of mothers who received antenatal corticosteroids with those of children of mothers who did not receive antenatal corticosteroids. We focused on differences between singletons and twins, between monochorionic and dichorionic twins and between the first and second twin.\nThe study comprised 23,502 singletons and 6,546 twins. Antenatal corticosteroid treatment was associated with significant decreased short-term neurologic outcomes in both singletons and twins. However, antenatal corticosteroid treatment was associated with significantly decreased mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.61; 95% CI 0.53-0.70), respiratory distress syndrome (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.67-0.76), and cerebral palsy (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72-0.99) in singletons but not in twins (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.68-1.17; OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87-1.12; and OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61-1.11, respectively). No association was found between chorionicity and the efficacy of antenatal corticosteroid treatment on outcomes. Further, no association was found between birth order and the efficacy of antenatal corticosteroid treatment on outcomes, except for periventricular leukomalacia and necrotizing enterocolitis (interaction: P=.02 and P=.04, respectively).\nAntenatal corticosteroid treatment in twins was associated with a beneficial effect on short-term neurologic outcomes only, without improvement in other short-term and medium-term outcomes. There was no difference related to chorionicity.",

    "abstract": "December 22, 2018, a pair of female baby twins aged 2 years with severe burns at the same time were transferred from the primary hospital to the People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on day 17 post burn. Physical examination on admission showed that both of them had severe burns on head, face, left upper limb, foot, etc. The blood preparations were difficult for them due to their rare blood types, with the elder sister of type B blood combined with Rh D mutant and the younger sister of type B combined with Rh negative blood. The total area of burn of the younger sister was 15% total body surface area (TBSA), with full-thickness burns with tendon and bone exposure in left ear and most of the ear auricle fallen off. The younger sister was treated with anti-infection, anti-shock by fluid infusion, and nutritional support. Split-thickness skin graft on left thigh was harvested to repair wound on left upper limb, and thin medium-thickness skin graft was harvested from right thigh in different operations to repair wounds on head and face, and thin medium-thickness skin graft from right thigh with area of 3 cm\u00d71 cm was reserved. The total area of burn of the elder sister was 22% TBSA, combined with inhalation injury and severe lung infection after tracheotomy, and the condition was critical. After admission to the hospital, anti-infection, anti-shock by fluid infusion, nutritional support, atomization, and eliminating phlegm treatment were performed. After the general condition was basically stable and blood preparation was sufficient, thin medium-thickness skin grafts were harvested from left thigh to repair wounds on head, face, and left upper limb, and the reserved thin medium-thickness skin graft from right thigh of the younger sister was transferred to the posterior ear wound of the elder sister. The skin grafts survived after operation with expansion showing no difference from autogenous skin. The elder sister and the younger sister were discharged from the hospital on the 24 and 21 day of hospitalization respectively.

    "abstract": "Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC) is a rare disorder characterized by frequent, transient attacks of hemiplegia involving either side of the body or both in association to several other disturbances including dystonic spells, abnormal ocular movements, autonomic manifestations, epileptic seizures and cognitive impairment. The clinical manifestations usually start before the age of 18 months. Two forms of the disorder known as AHC-1 (MIM#104290) and AHC-2 (MIM#614820) depends on mutations in ATP1A2 and ATP1A3 genes respectively, with over 75% of AHC caused by a mutation in the ATP1A3 gene. Herewith, we report serial clinical follow-up data of monozygotic (MZ) twin sisters, who presented in early life bath-induced dystonia, signs of acute encephalopathy at the age of 2 years, hemiplegic spells, and motor dysfunction after the age of 3 years, and in young/adult frequent episodes of headache with drastic reduction of paroxysmal motor attacks. The molecular analysis revealed a known pathogenic variant p.Asn773Ser (rs606231437) in ATP1A3 gene associated with an unusual and moderate AHC-2 phenotype, with mild cognitive impairment and lack of epilepsy. The aim of this study is to analyze the clinical phases of the MZ twins, and to investigate the novel genotype-phenotype correlation.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) sonography combined with tomographic ultrasound imaging (TUI) to observe placental vascular anastomoses in monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies was evaluated.\nWomen with MCDA twin pregnancies at a gestational age of 16-32 weeks were enrolled in this retrospective study. Placental anastomoses were detected using two-dimensional (2D) and 3D sonography. Two-dimensional data were obtained by color and spectral Doppler and 3D data with high-definition flow within the area between twins' umbilical cord insertions. Volume post-processing using TUI mode identified anastomoses. Anastomotic findings on ultrasound were compared with fetoscopic surgery or postnatally injected placentas for diagnostic value. Anastomoses detection was compared between the two imaging modalities.\nSeventy-six twin pregnancies were analyzed: 11 selective intrauterine growth restrictions (sIUGR), 10 twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), and 55 without complications. Seventy-one twin pregnancies had arterio-arterial (AA) anastomoses and 75 had arterio-venous (AV) anastomoses. Three-dimensional sonography combined with TUI was more sensitive (87.3%) and accurate (88.2%) in detecting AA anastomoses than 2D sonography (74.6%, 76.3%, respectively; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but had comparable sensitivity for AV anastomoses. The specificity of both modalities for anastomoses was 100%. The detection rate of AA anastomoses by 3D modality was (40%) TTTS vs. (87.3%) normal (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but comparable (90.9%) for sIUGR. The detection rates of AV anastomoses (90%, 81.8%) in TTTS and sIUGR were comparable with (87.3%) normal (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05).\nThree-dimensional sonography combined with TUI highlighted placental anastomoses and may be useful for the clinical diagnosis and therapy of MCDA twin complications.",

    "abstract": "Infant boys have worse outcomes than girls. In twins, the 'male disadvantage' has been reported to extend to female co-twins via a 'masculinising' effect. We studied the association between sex pairing and neonatal outcomes in extremely preterm twins.\nRetrospective cohort study SETTING: Eleven countries participating in the International Network for Evaluating Outcomes of Neonates.\nLiveborn twins admitted at 23-29 weeks' gestation in 2007-2015.\nWe examined in-hospital mortality, grades 3/4 intraventricular haemorrhage or cystic periventricular leukomalacia (IVH/PVL), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), retinopathy of prematurity requiring treatment and a composite outcome (mortality or any of the outcomes above).\nAmong 20\u2009924 twins, 38% were from male-male pairs, 32% were from female-female pairs and 30% were sex discordant. We had no information on chorionicity. Girls with a male co-twin had lower odds of mortality, IVH/PVL and the composite outcome than girl-girl pairs (reference group): adjusted OR (aOR) (95% CI) 0.79 (0.68 to 0.92), 0.83 (0.72 to 0.96) and 0.88 (0.79 to 0.98), respectively. Boys with a female co-twin also had lower odds of mortality: aOR 0.86 (0.74 to 0.99). Boys from male-male pairs had highest odds of BPD and composite outcome: aOR 1.38 (1.24 to 1.52) and 1.27 (1.16 to 1.39), respectively.\nSex-related disparities in outcomes exist in extremely preterm twins, with girls having lower risks than boys and opposite-sex pairs having lower risks than same-sex pairs. Our results may help clinicians in assessing risk in this large segment of extremely preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "The rate of twinning continues to increase due to the combined effect of a rise in parental age and increased use of assisted reproductive technology. The risk of congenital anomalies in twins is higher than in singletons, but it is less well reported in relation to growth patterns. We focused to the auxological outcome of twin pregnancies when one or both of twins are affected by one or more malformations.\nWe conducted a retrospective observational study reviewing the clinical charts of twins admitted in the period between January 2003 and December 2018 at the University Hospital of Palermo. The associations between malformations and anthropometric variables at birth were analyzed by comparison within each twin pair and regarding each variable as ordered difference between the two twins.\nWe studied data of 488 neonates (52% females) from 244 pregnancies. The rate of major congenital anomalies was 11%, affecting significantly the smaller twin (p\u2009=\u00a0.00018; Odds ratio 3.21; 95% CI 1.65 6.59). Malformation class distribution was as following: genitourinary (24%), gastrointestinal (20%), cardiovascular (18.5%), musculoskeletal (11%), central nervous system (9%), syndromic (9%), ocular (5.5%) and diaphragmatic hernia (2%). The most predictive value, the Birthweight (BW) difference mean ratio in malformed versus not malformed neonates (-\u20090.31 vs 0.02; p\u2009=\u00a0.0016) was distributed equally lower than zero in all malformed twins, except for those with congenital heart defects (p\u2009=\u00a0.0000083). Microcephaly (head circumference\u2009<\u20092 standard deviation, SD) was present in 3% of symmetrically smaller twin, and severe microcephaly (<\u20093 SD) was present in 0.6%. We found that an intertwin BW discordance of 18% or greater identified 50% of neonates with microcephaly, but only 11% of malformed twins.\nIn case of one twin with a BW <\u200910th centile, a concomitant intertwin BW discordance \u226518% could reveal an increased risk for microcephaly but not for malformation. Lower values of BW, Ponderal index, Body mass index but above all negative value of BW difference mean ratio are associated with malformations in twin pairs.",

We found that an intertwin BW discordance of 18% or greater identified 50% of neonates with microcephaly, but only 11% of malformed twins.",

    "abstract": "To investigate segmented macular layer volumes from a healthy adult twin cohort (TwinsUK), exploring changes with age and heritability.\nMacular spectral domain optical coherence tomography images were acquired from monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins in a cross-sectional study. The following layer volumes were derived for circles of 3 and 6 mm diameter around the foveal center, using automated segmentation software: retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), photoreceptors (PR), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and total retinal volume (TRV). Correlation coefficients (intereye; age; intrapair for MZ and DZ pairs) were quantified; heritability was estimated using structural equation modeling.\nScans from 184 participants were included. Intereye correlation was highest for TRV and GCIPL. Negative correlations with age (for 3- or 6-mm areas, or both) were observed for TRV, RNFL, GCIPL, and INL. Positive correlations were observed for PR, RPE, and OPL. For all layers, intrapair correlation was greater for MZ than DZ pairs. Heritability estimates were highest (>80%) for TRV and GCIPL volume, and lowest for RPE volume.\nAlthough TRV was negatively correlated with age, all layers did not show negative correlation. Some inner layers thinned with age, whereas some outer volumes increased (not the ONL). Reduced RPE phagocytic function with age and remodeling in the OPL could be contributing factors. Heritability estimates were highest for inner retinal layers (particularly GCIPL), and lowest for RPE volume.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is an immunodeficient skin disorder, and its exact pathogenesis is unclear. Monozygotic twins are presumed to be genetically identical, and their phenotypic differences may be due to transcriptional regulation or epigenome factors. To explain the inconsistency between twins, we have collected 3 pairs of monozygotic twins who are discordant for psoriasis.\nReduced representation of bisulfite sequencing and RNA sequencing was conducted using the peripheral blood of the twins to find the genes playing important roles in psoriasis pathogenesis.\nAs a result, we found methylation diversity in four genes (MAST3, MTOR, PM20D1 and ZNF99), and we also found 9 differentially expressed genes (PPAN-P2RY11, PIGV, RPS18, TMEM121, KIF21A, KCNH2, WNT10B, PRX and CDH24) by RNA sequencing. According to the conjoint analysis of methylation and the mRNA results, PTPN6, CCL5, NFATC1 and PRF1 were found to be closely related to psoriasis. We then annotated the genes to explore the associations between these genes and psoriasis.\nThese findings provide a better understanding of psoriasis that can improve the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.",

Although there is high prenatal and postnatal mortality for craniopagus twins, successful separation has become more common due to advances in neuroimaging, neuroanesthesia, and neurosurgical techniques. Joined brain tissue, shared arteries and veins, and defects in the skull and dura make surgery technically challenging, and neuroimaging plays an important role in preoperative planning. Drawing on our experience from consultation for multiple successful separations of craniopagus twins, we discuss what radiologists need to know about the anatomy, classification, imaging techniques, and surgical management of craniopagus twins.",

    "abstract": "An altered immune response to pathogens has been suggested to explain increased susceptibility to infectious diseases in patients with diabetes. Recent evidence has documented several immunometabolic pathways in patients with diabetes directly related to the COVID-19 infection. This also seems to be the case for prediabetic subjects with proinflammatory insulin resistance syndrome accompanied with prothrombotic hyperinsulinemic and dysglycemic states. Patients with frank hyperglycemia, dysglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia develop systemic immunometabolic inflammation with higher levels of circulating cytokines. This deleterious scenario has been proposed as the underlying mechanism enhancing a cytokine storm-like hyperinflammatory state in diabetics infected with severe COVID-19 triggering multi-organ failure. Compared with moderately affected COVID-19 patients, diabetes was found to be highly prevalent among severely affected patients suggesting that this non-communicable disease should be considered as a risk factor for adverse outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic mirrors with the diabetes pandemic in many pathobiological aspects. Our interest is to emphasize the ties between the immunoinflammatory mechanisms that underlie the morbidity and lethality when COVID-19 meets diabetes. This review brings attention to two pathologies of highly complex, multifactorial, developmental and environmentally dependent manifestations of critical importance to human survival. Extreme caution should be taken with diabetics with suspected symptoms of COVID-19 infection.",

    "abstract": "The inflammatory response is an immune defense engaged immediately after injury or infection. Chronic inflammation can be deleterious for various health outcomes and is characterized by high levels of pro-inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). A large body of research demonstrates these inflammatory markers are responsive to stress and quality of social relationships throughout the lifespan. For example, the quality of the early parental bond predicts various health outcomes and may be driven by changes in immune function. Epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, may be one mechanism by which early social experiences shape immune functioning. The present study used a monozygotic twin difference design to assess if mother-reported emotional availability at 1 year and 2.5 years predicted immune gene methylation at 8 years of age. Further, we assessed if inflammation gene methylation was related to general health problems (e.g. infections, allergies, etc.). We found that mother-reported emotional availability at 1 year, but not 2.5 years, was related to methylation of various immune genes in monozygotic twins. Furthermore, twin pairs discordant in health problems have more difference in immune gene methylation compared to twin pairs concordant for health problems, suggesting that methylation of immune genes may have functional consequences for general health. These results suggest that the emotional component of attachment quality during infancy contributes to immune epigenetic profiles in childhood, which may influence general health.",

    "abstract": "Discriminating between monozygotic twins (MZ) remains a challenge in the field of forensics globally. It is very difficult to find sequence variants within MZ twins, despite using ultra-deep next generation sequencing (NGS) for nuclear DNA. However, mitochondrial DNA might be a potential marker owing to its higher mutation rate and easier sequencing via NGS. Here, we aimed to introduce a long-read single molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT) strategy, with better continuity and fewer alignment errors, to obtain more accurate mitochondrial genome (mtGenome) sequence on the Sequel platform. Compared to Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM), the long-read SMRT sequencing strategy generated highly accurate and mapped circular consensus sequence (CCS) reads and exhibited robust performance in terms of reliable repeatability, consistent coverage pattern, and balanced strands in mtGenome recovery. Moreover, the long-read SMRT strategy exhibited superior ability to not only identify accurate haplotypes but also discover a total of 785 low-level variants within 16 MZ twin pairs with threshold of 2% and 20 CCS reads with Q30 quality. Taken together, our findings suggested the long-read SMRT technology as an appreciable strategy for obtaining accurate mitotypes and providing a promising solution for distinguishing between MZ twin pairs in forensic genetics.",

Placental biopsy specimens were obtained from the subjects in the delivery suite. The placental transcriptome of the selectively growth-restricted twin was compared with that of the normally grown cotwin. This study was divided into 2 stages: (1) gene discovery phase in which placental tissues from 5 monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies complicated by selective fetal growth restriction plus 2 control twin pregnancies underwent transcriptome profiling, and transcriptome profiling was carried out using whole-genome RNA sequencing; and (2) validation phase in which placental tissues from 13 monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies with selective fetal growth restriction underwent RNA and protein validation. RNA and protein expression levels of candidate genes were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry staining.\nA total of 1429 transcripts were differentially expressed in the placentae of selectively growth-restricted twin pairs, where 610 were up-regulated and 819 were down-regulated. Endoplasmic reticulum lectin and mannose 6-phosphate receptor were consistently differentially up-regulated in all placentae of selectively growth-restricted twins. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry staining were used to validate the results (P<.05).\nThe expression of endoplasmic reticulum lectin and mannose 6-phosphate receptor, which are important for angiogenesis and fetal growth, was significantly increased in the placentae of selectively growth-restricted twin of a monochorionic twin pair.",

    "abstract": "What factors are associated with monozygotic twins (MZT) after autologous IVF/ICSI with fresh and frozen/thawed single embryo transfer (SET) and what is the outcome of MZT?\nFactors associated with increased MZT were blastocyst transfer and elective single embryo transfer (eSET), with MZT showing a lower gestational age at birth and neonatal weight but higher perinatal mortality only after fresh transfer.\nART is associated with an increased incidence of MZT, which carries higher perinatal mortality. However, risk factors associated with MZT are still controversial.\nA population-based retrospective analysis of data extracted from ART cycles reported to the Latin American Registry of ART between January 2012 and December 2016 was used in order to study the frequency and outcome of MZT after SET.\nIn total, 2925 clinical pregnancies obtained after autologous IVF/ICSI with fresh SET were used to study biomedical factors possibly associated with MZT, such as maternal age, type of insemination, use of assisted hatching, stage of embryo development at transfer, elective or non-elective SET and preimplantation genetic testing. Another group of 3085 clinical pregnancies obtained after SET of frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) was also used to study the possible association between embryo freezing and MZT. Only pregnancies with complete follow-up until birth were included in this analysis. The diagnosis of MZT was established by transvaginal ultrasound performed at 6\u20138\u00a0weeks of amenorrhea. The rate of MZT for each potential risk factor was obtained and a multivariable logistic regression was performed in order to account for the above-mentioned factors. Pregnancies were followed until birth and the early neonatal period in order to assess the rate of miscarriage and stillbirths, gestational age at birth, neonatal weight and early neonatal mortality.\nThere were 76 MZT out of 2925 clinical pregnancies with fresh SET (2.6%) and 69 MZT out of 3085 clinical pregnancies after FET (2.2%) (odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20090.85, 95% CI 0.61\u20131.19). A statistically significantly increase in MZT rate was observed with blastocyst compared with cleavage stage ET (3.4 versus 2.0%, respectively; OR\u2009=\u20091.70, 95% CI 1.05\u20132.76). When confounding variables were considered, eSET was also significantly associated with an increase in the odds of MZT (OR\u2009=\u20091.74, 95% CI 1.04\u20132.92). Overall perinatal mortality was higher in MZT compared with singletons, but this rise was only significant after fresh ET.\nLimitations of the current study result from the fact that MZT were diagnosed with ultrasound performed at 6\u20138\u00a0weeks of amenorrhea; therefore, spontaneous embryo reductions taking place earlier were missed.\nReproductive health providers must inform their patients that blastocyst transfer and eSET of fresh embryos are associated with a statistically significantly increase in the odds of MZT and that perinatal mortality after fresh ET is significantly higher in MZT than in singletons.\nThe Latin American Registry of ART receives direct funding from Ferring Pharmaceuticals, but no specific funding was received to undertake this study. None of the authors declare conflict of interest.",

The concordance of morphologic (i.e., phenotype) findings and clinical course between the 2 patients is remarkable, including timing of the onset and progression of heart failure due to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, frequency of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and beneficial response to surgical myectomy and Cox-Maze IV procedure (performed 14 days apart). Histopathology of resected ventricular septal muscle showed identical hallmarks of HC including myocyte disorganization, small vessel disease, and myocardial fibrosis. A missense variant of the CRYAB gene was identified as potentially relevant to the pathogenesis of HC in the twins. Taken together, these observations support a powerful genetic determinant for the morphologic and clinical expression of HC, with little or no environmental influence.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to adverse stressors has been associated with shortening of leukocyte telomere length (LTL). The present longitudinal study investigates the time course of exposure to life events and LTL to determine whether increases in exposure to life events are related to subsequent accelerated LTL shortening.\nIn the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging, we assessed late-life stressful events and LTL in 543 individual participants (mean age = 68.4 years, 40% men, including 48 complete monozygotic twin pairs and 167 complete dizygotic twin pairs) in up to five separate measurements over a period of 25 years. LTL was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Longitudinal analyses were conducted using time-varying mixed modeling, corrected for life-style factors and depressive symptoms.\nWhen adjusting for differences in genetic makeup by looking only in monozygotic twins, we found that an increase in life stressors within an individual was related to decreased LTL over time (B = -0.02; 95% confidence interval = -0.04 to 0.01; p = .002). None of the findings were significant when only looking at dizygotic twins (all, p > .05).\nOur findings in an older population show a causal relation between increase in life stress and accelerated LTL shortening by using intraindividual time-varying analysis.",

    "abstract": "Nephrogenesis is a complex process of nephron formation and maturation that can be compromised by preterm delivery and intrauterine growth restriction. This study aimed to evaluate and compare urinary Cys-C levels with renal volume in a cohort of preterm and term twins, adequate for gestational age or intrauterine growth restricted, to investigate their values in different conditions of nephrogenesis.\nThe study was performed on twins at 30-40 days of postnatal corrected age: renal volumes were measured by 3D ultrasound technology and urine samples were analyzed for Cystatin-C. A follow-up was performed by Cystatin-C.\nRenal volumes in preterm and intrauterine growth-restricted twins showed values significantly lower than those observed in term twins and were inversely correlated to urinary Cystatin-C levels. During the follow-up, intrauterine growth-restricted twins showed amplified levels of urinary Cystatin-C; in contrast, invariable or decreased levels were observed in adequate for gestational age twins.\nUrinary Cystatin-C, evaluated when intrauterine/extrauterine nephrogenesis could be considered completed, concurrently with renal volume assessment can improve the identification of neonates with initial kidney impairment. Its potential value as a useful marker in monitoring physiological/pathological renal conditions could be considered, mainly for neonates at elevated risk of developing long-term renal diseases.\nUrinary Cys-C levels are inversely correlated to renal volumes and reflect nephrogenesis conditions. No data in literature are reported regarding: (a) the concurrent assessment of renal volumes and urinary levels of Cystatin-C in preterm and term twins with different conditions of gestational life, i.e., AGA and IUGR and (b) the follow-up of IUGR and preterm neonates using the urinary Cys-C determination. The variations of urinary Cys-C levels, observed in the follow-up of preterm and/or IUGR neonates, support the usefulness of monitoring those neonates with altered nephrogenesis, who are later at risk for renal impairment and for long-term renal diseases.",

    "abstract": "The twin pregnancy is a risk pregnancy, being associated with a series of fetal and neonatal complications when compared to singleton pregnancies. Ultrasound assessment of the fetal brain is mandatory in the prenatal screening for fetal, congenital and acquired anomalies. Fetal neurosonography is useful in the prenatal diagnosis of cerebral anomalies, combining ultrasonography with fetal ultrasound. In this study, we assessed the Kanet score in two populations of pregnant women with dichorionic twin pregnancies (DC twin) (n=67) and monochorionic twin pregnancies (MC twin) (n=24). In the two groups we included pregnancies with normal fetal growth and pregnancies with discordant fetal growth (DC twin) and selective intrauterine reatriction (MC twin). For both groups, we assessed the antenatal Kanet score during three visits and compared the results with the neurodevelopment immediately after birth up to the two-year-old children. The calculation of the average values of the Kanet score for dichorionic pregnancies revealed normal, maximal average values at all three visits, for all fetuses, no matter if they had normal growth or discordant growth. At the first and third visit, we observed statistically significant differences between the average Kanet scores in DC twins with discordant growth ",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to provide insight into the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to palatal morphology variation in a cohort of Australian twins.\nHealthy Australian twins, aged 12-15 years (45 monozygotic, 46 same sex dizygotic, and 32 opposite-sex dizygotic) were included in the study groups. A scanner was used to obtain three-dimensional data of the maxillary arch. Palatal depth was defined by a line to the deepest point measured from the reference plane at the mid-point of the inter-pre-molar or inter-molar line. This line was then divided into 10 equal sections in order to created 10 different depths for each palatal width. Each palatal width was divided into anterior and posterior areas. Univariate genetic analysis, using the OpenMx structural equation modelling package in R, was carried out on the quantitative data using the normal assumptions of a twin model.\nHeritability estimates for anterior palatal width ranged from 0.75 to 0.80, and from 0.78 to 0.86 for posterior palatal width. Estimates for anterior and posterior palatal depth were 0.72 and 0.86, respectively.\nPalatal morphology tends to have a moderate to relatively high genetic contribution overall. Palate height has a higher genetic contribution posteriorly than anteriorly. The width of the deep palate is under marginally less stringent genetic regulation than the width of the shallow palate.",

    "abstract": "The Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy syndrome (BBSOAS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder (OMIM615722) mostly characterized by optic atrophy and/or hypoplasia, mild intellectual disability, hypotonia, seizures/infantile epilepsy. This disorder is caused by loss-of-function alterations of NR2F1 (i.e., either whole gene deletions or single nucleotide variants) and, to date, 40 patients have been identified with deletions or mutations in this gene. Here we describe two monozygotic twins harboring a de novo missense variant in the DNA-binding domain of NR2F1 (c.313G>A, p.Gly105Ser), with well-characterized features associated to BBSOAS.\nPatients' DNA was analyzed by exome sequencing identifying the missense variant c.313G>A in NR2F1 (NM_005654.4). Furthermore, molecular modeling was performed to evaluate putative differences in DNA binding between wild-type and mutated NR2F1.\nThe missense variant is predicted to be likely pathogenetic following the ACMG (American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics)/AMP (Association for Molecular Pathology) guidelines. Indeed, dynamic simulation experiments highlighted that the Gly105Ser substitution let the formation of a hydrogen bond between the S105 side chain and R142 and a base (G5) of the DNA sequence, allowing us to hypothesize that the G105 residue might be evolutionary conserved due to the absence of a side chain, besides glycine conformational features. Therefore, the G105S variation seems to cause a stiffening and a possible deformation in the protein-DNA complex due to the interaction of residues R142-S105 and G5 on the DNA, compared to the wild-type.\nIn summary, we described two monozygotic twins harboring a novel Gly105Ser mutation in NR2F1 DNA binding domain, displaying the classical phenotype of BBSOAS-affected patients. Our computational data suggest a dominant negative effect of this newly characterized missense variant. To date, this is the first genetic report analyzing in silico structural consequences of NR2F1 Gly105Ser substitution.",

    "abstract": "To compare the prevalence of intermittent absent or reversed end-diastolic flow (iAREDF) in the umbilical artery in appropriately grown monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) pregnancies with and without proximate cord insertion (PCI), and to evaluate pregnancy outcome.\nThe prevalence of iAREDF in MCDA pregnancies with PCI (n = 11) was compared with a control group without PCI (n = 33). PCI was defined as a distance between the cord insertions below the fifth percentile. Placental sharing, number, and diameter of anastomoses were assessed by placental examination. Pregnancy outcome was evaluated.\niAREDF was present in 7/11 PCI pregnancies, compared with 0/33 in the control group (P \u2264\u2009.01). All PCI pregnancies and 94% of controls had arterioarterial (AA)-anastomoses (P =\u2009.56), the diameter was larger in the PCI group, respectively 3.3 vs 2.1\u2009mm (P =\u2009.03). Three cases with iAREDF had adverse outcome, two resulted in fetal death of which one with brain damage in the co-twin, another underwent early premature emergency section for fetal distress.\niAREDF occurs in a large proportion of MCDA pregnancies with PCI and is related to the diameter of the AA anastomosis. We hypothesize that iAREDF in appropriately grown MCDA twin pregnancies reflects an unstable hemodynamic balance with an increased risk for fetal deterioration. Whether outcome in these pregnancies can be improved by altered management requires further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Humans are host to a multitude of microorganisms that rapidly populate the body at birth, subject to a complex interplay that is dependent on host genetics, lifestyle, and environment. The host-associated microbiome, including the oral microbiome, presents itself in a complex ecosystem important to health and disease. As the most common chronic disease globally, dental caries is induced by host-microbial dysbiosis in children and adults. Multiple biological and environmental factors are likely to impact disease predisposition, onset, progression, and severity, yet longitudinal studies able to capture these influences are missing. To investigate how host genetics and environment influenced the oral microbial communities over time, we profiled supragingival plaque microbiomes of dizygotic and monozygotic twins during 3 visits over 12-months. Dental plaque DNA samples were amplified by targeting the 16S rRNA gene V4 region, and microbial findings were correlated with clinical, diet and genetic metadata. We observed that the oral microbiome variances were shaped primarily by the environment when compared to host genetics. Among the environmental factors shaping microbial changes of our subjects, significant metadata included age of the subject, and the age by which subjects initiated brushing habits, and the types of actions post-brushing. Relevant heritability of the microbiome included Actinomyces and Capnocytophaga in monozygotic twins and Kingella in dizygotic twins. Corynebacterium and Veillonella abundances were associated with age, whereas Aggregatibacter was associated with younger subjects. Streptococcus abundance showed an inverse association over time, and Selenomonas abundances increased with brushing frequency per day. Unraveling the exact biological mechanisms in caries has the potential to reveal novel host-microbial biomarkers, pathways, and targets important to effective preventive measures, and early disease control in children.",

    "abstract": "Adverse prenatal conditions can exert a long-lasting impact on growth up to final height (FH). Due to different prenatal nutrient availability, monozygotic twin pairs with discordant birth weight (bw) provide an excellent model to examine the impact of genes and environment and to analyse the predictive value of bw, birth length (bl) and cord blood (cb) concentration of IGF-I on FH.\nTwenty eight monozygotic twin pairs with intra-twin bw-/bl-differences were studied at birth and longitudinally until FH. Intra-twin bw difference >1 SDS was defined \"discordant\" (n\u00a0=\u00a010 pairs). IGF-I was analysed in cord blood in all twins. Intra-twin differences (\u2206) in bw, bl and cord blood IGF-I were correlated with \u2206FH.\nThroughout growth and up until FH intra-twin length/height differences remained for all but two (26/28) twins and for all (10/10) discordant twins. In the discordant group, a highly significant intra-twin difference for FH-SDS was found with a mean intra-twin \u0394height- SDS of 1.23 (range, 0.29-2.34). This corresponds to a mean \u0394intra-twin difference at FH of 7.9\u00a0cm (3.1 inch; range, 2-15\u00a0cm [0.79-5.9 inch]). Correlation coefficients were calculated to identify factors predicting FH: \u2206bw (r\u00a0=\u00a0.678; P\u00a0=\u00a0.0005), \u2206bl (r\u00a0=\u00a0.333; P\u00a0=\u00a0.0002) and \u2206IGF-I in cb (r\u00a0=\u00a0.418; P\u00a0=\u00a0.0023). Interaction terms showed that IGF-I is an additional factor to the auxological data, leading to an improvement of the \u2206FH modelling.\nPrenatal environment leading to bw-/bl- and cbIGF-I differences in monozygotic twins had a long-lasting impact on growth until FH. Both, anthropometric data at birth and cbIGF-I are predictive of FH.",

    "abstract": "For those who work in the field of islet transplantation, the microvascular coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lung vessels obstructive thrombo-inflammatory syndrome (recently referred to as MicroCLOTS) is familiar, as one cannot fail to recognize the presence of similarities with the instant blood mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) occurring in the liver hours and days after islet infusion. Evidence in both MicroCLOTS and IBMIR suggests the involvement of the coagulation cascade and complement system activation and proinflammatory chemokines/cytokines release. Identification and targeting of pathway(s) playing a role as \"master regulator(s)\" in the post-islet transplant detrimental inflammatory events could be potentially useful to suggest innovative COVID-19 treatments and vice versa. Scientific organizations across the world are fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Islet transplantation, and more generally the transplantation scientific community, could contribute by suggesting strategies for innovative approaches. At the same time, in the near future, clinical trials in COVID-19 patients will produce an enormous quantity of clinical and translational data on the control of inflammation and complement/microthrombosis activation. These data will represent a legacy to be transformed into innovation in the transplant field. It will be our contribution to change a dramatic event into advancement for the transplant field and ultimately for our patients.",

ALG3-CDG is a very rare subtype with only 24 cases reported so far.\nHere, we report two siblings with dysmorphic features, growth retardation, microcephaly, intractable epilepsy, and hemangioma in the frontal, occipital and lumbosacral regions.\nWe studied two siblings by whole exome sequencing. A pathogenic variant in ALG3 (NM_005787.6: c.165C\u00a0>\u00a0T; p.Gly55=) that had been previously associated with congenital glycolysis defect type 1d was identified. Their intractable seizures were controlled by ketogenic diet.\nAlthough prominent findings of growth retardation and microcephaly seen in our patients have been extensively reported before, presence of hemangioma is a novel finding that may be used as an indication for ALG3-CDG diagnosis. Our patients are the first reported cases whose intractable seizures were controlled with ketogenic diet. This report adds ketogenic diet as an option for treatment of intractable epilepsy in ALG3-CDG.",

    "abstract": "Using Swedish nationwide registry data, we investigated the contribution of genetic and environmental risk factors to the etiology of smoking status across stages of pregnancy with increasing degrees of social and psychological pressure to reduce or quit smoking, by twin and sibling modeling.\nSmoking status was available before, and during early and late pregnancy from the Medical Birth Register. Twin, full-, and half-sibling pairs, both reared together and apart, born between 1960 and 1990 were obtained from national twin and genealogical registers. Genetic structural equation modeling in OpenMx was applied to the population-based data to estimate shared genetic and/or environmental covariance across stages of pregnancy, accounting for maternal birth cohort and age at pregnancy.\nAnalyses of paired data on 258 749 individuals suggested that risk factors for smoking status changed across stages of pregnancy. Results predicted substantial heritability (60-70%) and moderate contributions of shared environmental factors (10-15%) for smoking status. Whilst the same shared environmental factors were amplified from before pregnancy to late pregnancy, new primarily unique environmental factors explained ~10% of the variance during early pregnancy which was carried forward to late pregnancy.\nUsing registry data on women across pregnancy, we replicated that smoking status is highly heritable. Furthermore, we found support for increased impact of shared environmental factors during pregnancy of factors already present prior to pregnancy, and an independent set of mostly new unique environmental factors that may be triggered by increased social pressure to reduce or quit smoking during pregnancy.\nAs new factors partially explain smoking status during pregnancy and the effects of familial factors increase across pregnancy, efforts to prevent or reduce smoking during pregnancy should receive continued attention, with a focus on both the individual and the family unit.",

    "abstract": "At present, there is no clear understanding of the effect of long-duration spaceflight on the major enzymes that govern the metabolism of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. To address this gap in knowledge, we used data from the NASA Twins Study, which includes a multiscale omics investigation of the changes that occurred during a year-long (340 days) human spaceflight. Embedded within the NASA Twins data are specific analytes associated with fatty acid metabolism.\nTo examine the long-chain fatty acid desaturases and elongases in a single human during 1 year in space.\nOne male twin was on board the International Space Station (ISS) for 1 year, while his monozygotic twin served as a genetically matched ground control. Longitudinal assessments included the genome, epige-nome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, microbiome, and immunome during the mission, as well as 6 months before and after. The gene-specific fatty acid desaturase and elongase transcriptome data (FADS1, FADS2, ELOVL2, and ELOVL5) were extracted from untargeted RNA-seq measurements derived from white blood cell fractions.\nMost data from the elongases and desaturases exhibited relatively similar expression profiles (R2 >0.6) over time for the CD8, CD19, and lymphocyte-depleted (LD) cell fractions, indicating overall conservation of function within and between the subjects. Both cell-type and temporal specificity was observed in some cases, and some differences were also apparent between the polyadenylated (polyA) fraction of processed RNAs versus the ribodepleted (ribo-) fraction. The flight subject showed a stronger enrichment of the fatty acid metabolic process pathway across almost all cell types (columns, CD4, CD8, CPT, and LD), most especially in the ribodepleted fraction of RNA, but also with the polyA+ fraction of RNA. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) measures across three related fatty acid metabolism pathways showed a differential between the ground and the flight subject.\nThere appears to be no persistent alteration of desaturase and elongase gene expression associated with 1 year in space. However, these data provide evidence that cellular lipid metabolism can be responsive and dynamic to spaceflight, even though it appears cell-type and context specific, most notably in terms of the fraction of RNA measured and the collection protocols. These results also provide new evidence of mid-flight spikes in expression of selected genes, which may indicate transient responses to specific insults during spaceflight.",

    "abstract": "A number of high profile conjoined twin separations have been extensively covered by the world media. Anaesthesia for conjoined twins is a procedure rarely experienced by paediatric anaesthetists. The increased survival of the twins has prompted discussion as to the most appropriate selection of patients, teams and hospitals to provide exceptional anaesthetic care.\nThe number of conjoined twins presenting for surgery remains low with many infants not surviving foetal or early neonatal life. Anaesthetic management of less common conjoined infants such as craniopagus twins has highlighted the benefit of careful patient selection, extensive preoperative investigations and meticulous multidisciplinary team planning. The role of simulation of possible adverse perioperative events has been highlighted. Three dimensional anatomical models and virtual reality systems have permitted surgical planning in advance of actual intervention. A number of legal and ethical concerns have been reported especially in the setting of emergency separation where surgery is likely to contribute to death of one of the twins.\nThere appears to be an expanding role for international teams with extensive separation experience becoming involved in international teleconferencing to improve patient management in low-resource countries. Whether the perioperative outcome is better when the conjoined twins are transferred to major centres for surgery or teams operate in the twin's country of origin remains to be seen.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the demographic of biliary atresia (BA) children from twins family and aimed to investigated what it can add to the twins' literature and our understanding of the disease.\nThis study contains 11 medical centers in mainland China and the medical record of twins with BA was retrospectively analyzed from January 2012 to December 2018. Follow-up was carried out by out-patient review and questionnaire.\nThe study included 19 twin pairs in whom there was discordance for BA. Sixteen (84.2%) affected twin underwent Kasai Procedure (KP); median age at KP was 78 (49-168) days. There were ten affected twins that became jaundice-free at 3 months post-KP, and eight occurred with different degrees of cholangitis post-KP. Six affected twins received Liver Transplantation (LT) successfully. The 2\u00a0year native liver survival rate and the 2\u00a0year overall survival rate of affected twins were 61.1 and 94.4%, respectively. There were three affected monozygotic (MZ) twins and one healthy co-twin with BA-associated congenital malformations, all of which were cardiac malformations. The number of virus infection of affected MZ twins was significantly more (p\u2009=\u20090.04) than affected dizygotic (DZ) twin.\nDiscordance for BA in 19 pairs of twins supported that BA may be related to genetic phenotype or penetrance. The difference in genetic background between MZ and DZ affects the susceptibility of the host to virus infection. High acceptance of KP (84.2%) in our study implied a high motivation for treatment for twins with BA. Delays of KP (78\u00a0days) in affected twin may be related to the postnatal gradual onset and the late diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "A female advantage in social cognition (SoC) might contribute to women's underrepresentation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The latter could be underpinned by sex differences in social brain structure. This study investigated the relationship between structural social brain networks and SoC in females and males in relation to ASD and autistic traits in twins. We used a co-twin design in 77 twin pairs (39 female) aged 12.5 to 31.0\u00a0years. Twin pairs were discordant or concordant for ASD or autistic traits, discordant or concordant for other neurodevelopmental disorders or concordant for neurotypical development. They underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging and were assessed for SoC using the naturalistic Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition. Autistic traits predicted reduced SoC capacities predominantly in male twins, despite a comparable extent of autistic traits in each sex, although the association between SoC and autistic traits did not differ significantly between the sexes. Consistently, within-pair associations between SoC and social brain structure revealed that lower SoC ability was associated with increased cortical thickness of several brain regions, particularly in males. Our findings confirm the notion that sex differences in SoC in association with ASD are underpinned by sex differences in brain structure.",

    "abstract": "Depression has been suggested to hinder smoking cessation, especially when co-occurring with nicotine dependence. The study aimed to examine the longitudinal association of depressive symptoms with smoking cessation among daily smokers. The study utilized adult Finnish twin cohort where 1438 daily smokers (mean age: 38.3, range: 33-45) in 1990 were re-examined for their smoking status in 2011. We assessed baseline depressive symptoms with the Beck Depression Inventory, and the self-reported smoking status at follow-up. The methods included multinomial logistic regression and time to event analyses, adjusted for multiple covariates (age, sex, marital status, social class, heavy drinking occasions, and health status) and smoking heaviness at baseline assessed by cigarettes per day (CPD). Additionally, within-twin-pair analyses were conducted. Results indicated that moderate/severe depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with a lower likelihood of smoking cessation two decades later. Adjusting for covariates, those with moderate/severe depressive symptoms (vs. no/minimal depressive symptoms) had 46% lower likelihood of quitting (relative risk ratio, RRR\u00a0=\u00a00.54, 95% CI: 0.30-0.96). After including CPD, the association of depressive symptoms with smoking cessation attenuated modestly (RRR\u00a0=\u00a00.62, 95% CI: 0.34-1.12). Further, time to event analysis for quitting year since baseline yielded similar findings. In the within-pair analysis, depressive symptoms were not associated with quitting smoking. The results suggest that reporting more depressive symptoms is associated with a lower likelihood of smoking cessation during a 20-year period. The baseline amount of smoking and familial factors partly explain the observed association. Smoking cessation programs should monitor depressive symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Selective intrauterine fetal growth restriction (sIUGR) in monochorionic diamniotic twins, especially types 2&3 with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler, results in increased risk of fetal/perinatal mortality and postnatal disability. We investigate whether the hair metabolome profiles of neonates were associated with the pathophysiological differences across the different clinical forms of sIUGR in twins.\nHair samples were collected at delivery from 10 pairs of type 1 sIUGR twins, 8 pairs of types 2&3 sIUGR twins, and 11 pairs of twins without sIUGR. The hair metabolome was characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.\nOur results demonstrated that the hair metabolite profiles of the different sIUGR subclinical forms were associated with the averaged fetal growth rate after 28\u2009weeks of gestation but not with birthweight. The hair profiles were capable of discriminating type2&3 sIUGR twins from twins without sIUGR. In particular, the metabolites 2-aminobutyric acid, cysteine, alanine, and tyrosine all displayed areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were above 0.9. The metabolic pathway analysis highlighted the associations of sIUGR twins with abnormal umbilical artery flow with increased metabolites from a nutrient depletion pathway, glutathione metabolism, and nerve development.\nThis study offers novel insight into the severity of intrauterine ischemia and hypoxia for T2&3 sIUGR twins, through evaluation of the neonatal hair metabolome.",

The hair profiles were capable of discriminating type2&3 sIUGR twins from twins without sIUGR. In particular, the metabolites 2-aminobutyric acid, cysteine, alanine, and tyrosine all displayed areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were above 0.9. The metabolic pathway analysis highlighted the associations of sIUGR twins with abnormal umbilical artery flow with increased metabolites from a nutrient depletion pathway, glutathione metabolism, and nerve development.",

    "abstract": "Gender nonconformity (femininity in males, masculinity in females) is more common in non-heterosexual (bisexual and homosexual) than heterosexual individuals. In the past research (Watts, Holmes, Raines, Orbell, & Rieger, 2018b), identical twins discordant for sexual orientation were perceived more similar in their gender nonconformity than unrelated heterosexual and non-heterosexual people. Yet, these perceptions were based on photographs, which do not contain all aspects of gender nonconformity, such as movement and sound. This could have led to an underestimation of observable difference within twin pairs. We examined evaluations of video recordings from adult identical twins with discordant sexual orientations (eight male pairs, 11 female pairs). These twins were a small subset of those who participated in Watts et al. (2018b). Non-heterosexual twins were rated as significantly more gender nonconforming than their heterosexual co-twins, but only when males and females were combined. Their difference was smaller than the analogous difference between identical twins who were concordant heterosexual (three male pairs, three female pairs) and, unrelated to them, identical twins who were concordant non-heterosexual (six male pairs, two female pairs). These patterns were partially confirmed with twins' self-reported gender nonconformity. Shared influences possibly made twins from discordant pairs somewhat similar in their gender nonconformity, even if non-shared factors differentiated their sexual orientations.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins are genetically identical but rarely phenotypically identical. Epigenetic and transcriptional variation could influence this phenotypic discordance. Investigation of intra-pair differences in molecular markers and a given phenotype in monozygotic twins controls most of the genetic contribution, enabling studies of the molecular features of the phenotype. This study aimed to identify genes associated with cognition in later life using integrated enrichment analyses of the results of blood-derived intra-pair epigenome-wide and transcriptome-wide association analyses of cognition in 452 middle-aged and old-aged monozygotic twins (56-80 years). Integrated analyses were performed with an unsupervised approach using KeyPathwayMiner, and a supervised approach using the KEGG and Reactome databases. The supervised approach identified several enriched gene sets, including \"neuroactive ligand receptor interaction\" (",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the genetic and environmental factors influencing the localization of mandibular third molars by analyzing the panoramic radiographs of twins. We examined the mandibular third molars of Japanese monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins recruited by the Osaka University Center for Twin Research.\nThe present study included 49 pairs (98 participants) of MZ twins and 11 pairs (22 participants) of DZ twins. Using panoramic radiography, we evaluated the degree of eruption of mandibular third molars according to the height of the alveolus bone and the third molar space/crown width ratio. Using co-twin control analysis and a generalized linear mixed model, we evaluated the effects of various factors, including gender, age, body height, number of teeth, length of the lower dental arch, existence of a second\u00a0molar, bruxism, and previous orthodontic therapy.\nBody height, third molar space/crown width ratio, and length of the mandibular dental arch were related to the degree of mandibular third molar eruption and were strongly influenced by genetic factors rather than common or unique environmental factors.\nThe degree of third molar eruption was more similar among MZ twins than among DZ twins; therefore, genetic factors can be expected to have more significant influence than will environmental factors. These results can help identify the trend of third molar eruption from a young age, allowing us to advise the early extraction of mandibular third molars for patients with a short stature, narrow retromolar space, or short mandibular dental arch. In addition, if the genes that influence the degree of eruption were identified, we would be better equipped to predict an individual's risk of impaction, and indications for extraction might change.",

    "abstract": "Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder with high heterogeneity. The majority of NPHP patients progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within the first three decades of life. As an inherited disorder with highly genetic heterogeneity and clinical presentations, NPHP still poses a challenging task for nephrologists without special training to make a well-judged decision on its precise diagnosis, let alone its mechanism and optimal therapy.\nA Chinese family with NPHP was recruited in current study. The clinical characteristics (including findings from renal biopsy) of NPHP patients were collected from medical records and the potential responsible genes were explored by the whole exome sequencing (WES). A homozygous deletion of NPHP1 (1-20 exons) was found in both affected patients, which was further confirmed by quantitative PCR.\nHomozygous full gene deletion of the NPHP1 gene was identified in a Chinese family with NPHP, which was the molecular pathogenic basis of this disorder. Furthermore, identification of the pathogenic genes for those affected patients can help to have a full knowledge on NPHP's molecular mechanism and precise treatment.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies are among the most promising strategies for studying heritable disorders, including bipolar disorder (BD). The aim of the present study was to identify distinguishing genes between monozygotic (MZ) twins with different BD phenotype and compare them to their non-affected siblings. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) can identify rare and structural variants that could detect the polygenetic burden of complex disorders. WES was performed on a family composed of two MZ twins with BD, their unaffected brother and unaffected parents. The twins have a discordant response to lithium and distinct course of illness. Following WES, six genes of particular interest emerged: Neurofibromin type 1 (NF1), Biorientation of chromosomes in cell division 1 (BOD1), Golgi-associated gamma adaptin ear-containing ARF binding protein 3 (GGA3), Disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), Neuromedin U receptor 2 (NMUR2), and Huntingtin interacting protein 1-related (HIP1R). Interestingly, many of these influence glutamatergic pathways and thus the findings may have therapeutical implications. These results may provide important insights to unveil genetic underpinnings of BD and the response to lithium.",

    "abstract": "Objectives To evaluate the impact of placental anastomoses on the intrauterine growth of monochorionic (MC) twins. Methods A prospective study was conducted in a group of 53 MC twins. Intrapartally umbilical cords were clamped to identify placental sides corresponding to each twin. The postnatal dye injection technique was administered to evaluate vascular anastomoses, their number and type and visualize placental territory sharing patterns. Data from digital analysis were correlated with obstetrical follow-up. Results Vascular anastomoses were revealed in 88.7% of cases. Arteriovenous (AV) anastomoses occurred in 75.4% and arterioarterial (AA) in 71.1% while venovenous (VV) in 26.4%. In the subgroup of MC twins without placental anastomoses, significantly higher birthweight difference and discordance were revealed when compared to MC twins without anastomoses (382.0 vs. 22 g; P\u2009=\u20090.03 and 49.14% vs. 16.02%; P\u2009=\u20090.03). On the other hand, in subgroups of MC twins with at least one AA anastomosis, twins' birthweights were similar (p\u2009=\u2009ns) despite significantly higher placental territory sharing discordance (30.44% vs. 15.81%; P\u2009=\u20090.31). Conclusions Vascular anastomoses have a major impact on the intrauterine growth of MC twins. In certain cases, they may cause specific complications; however, in general, they regulate intertwin blood exchange and may compensate unequal placental territory.",

    "abstract": "Myocarditis most often affects otherwise healthy athletes and is one of the leading causes of sudden death in children and young adults. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a genetically determined heart muscle disorder with increased risk for paroxysmal ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The clinical picture of myocarditis and ARVC may overlap during the early stages of cardiomyopathy, which may lead to misdiagnosis. In the literature, we found several cases that presented with episodes of myocarditis and ended up with a diagnosis of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, mostly of the left predominant type. The aim of this case presentation is to shed light upon a possible link between myocarditis, a desmoplakin (DSP) gene variant, and ARVC by describing a case of male monozygotic twins who presented with symptoms and signs of myocarditis at 17 and 18\u00a0years of age, respectively. One of them also had a recurrent episode of myocarditis. The twins and their family were extensively examined including electrocardiograms (ECG), biochemistry, multimodal cardiac imaging, myocardial biopsy, genetic analysis, repeated cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and echocardiography over time. Both twins presented with chest pain, ECG with slight ST-T elevation, and increased troponin T levels. CMR demonstrated an affected left ventricle with comprehensive inflammatory, subepicardial changes consistent with myocarditis. The right ventricle did not appear to have any abnormalities. Genotype analysis revealed a nonsense heterozygous variant in the desmoplakin (DSP) gene [NM_004415.2:c.2521_2522del (p.Gln841Aspfs*9)] that is considered likely pathogenic and presumably ARVC related. There was no previous family history of heart disease. There might be a common pathophysiology of ARVC, associated with desmosomal dysfunction, and myocarditis. In our case, both twins have an affected left ventricle without any right ventricular involvement, and they are carriers of a novel DSP variant that is likely associated with ARVC. The extensive inflammation of the LV that was apparent in the CMR may or may not be the primary event of ARVC. Nevertheless, our data suggest that irrespective of a possible link here to ARVC, genetic testing for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy might be advisable for patients with recurrent myocarditis associated with a family history of myocarditis.",

    "abstract": "Since conjoined twins were thought to be monoamniotic in the past, diamniotic conjoined twins would be improbable theoretically. Body stalk anomaly is a severe defect of the body wall, which is rare among twins. Body stalk anomaly in monochorionic diamniotic conjoined twins has never been reported prenatally so far as we know.\nHere we present an extremely rare case of concordant body stalk anomaly in monochorionic diamniotic conjoined twins. Ultrasonography at 9\u2009+\u20095\u2009weeks revealed one chorionic and two amniotic cavities, close apposition of abdomen, limited movement, and common umbilical vessels. Follow-up ultrasonography at 11\u2009+\u20096\u2009weeks and 13\u2009+\u20092\u2009weeks showed close apposition of the lower abdominal region with cystic structures and a small bowel-like mass between the two fetuses. Three-dimensional ultrasonography assisted in observing the entire appearance of both twins in earlier first trimester, including amnioticity, conjoined region and umbilical vessels. We attribute this diamniotic conjoined twin in our case to the fusion theory. A single yolk sac was observed, challenging the idea that yolk sac number predicts amnionicity. Identification of single yolk sac and its allantois may form a common body stalk during this fusion, leading to concordant body stalk anomaly in monochorionic diamniotic twins.\nOur case may provide important insights into both ultrasonographic features and embryogenesis of this extremely rare anomaly.",

    "abstract": "Are obstetric and perinatal outcomes in pregnancies after fresh blastocyst transfer (BT) comparable with those born after fresh cleavage stage transfer (CT) and spontaneous conception (SC)?\nFresh BT is associated with a higher risk of placental and perinatal complications.\nBT optimizes the selection of top-quality embryos and increases pregnancy and live birth rates per transfer compared to CT. However, concerns have been raised as extended culture duration may increase obstetric complications and impair perinatal outcomes. Previous studies have shown a higher risk of preterm birth (PTB) among infants born after BT compared with CT. Pregnancies after BT are also prone to a higher risk of same-sex twins after single embryo transfer (SET).\nA retrospective register-based cohort study used data from Denmark, Norway and Sweden including three cohorts: 56\u2009557 singletons and 16\u2009315 twins born after fresh IVF/ICSI cycles and 2\u2009808\u2009323 SC singletons in Denmark (birth years 1997-2014), Norway (2010-2015) and Sweden (2002-2015). Of the fresh IVF/ICSI singletons, 4601 were born after BT and 51\u2009956 after CT. The twin cohort consisted of 884 fresh IVF/ICSI children born after BT and 15\u2009431 fresh IVF/ICSI children born after CT.\nData were obtained from a large Nordic cohort of children born after ART and SC initiated by the Committee of Nordic ART and Safety (CoNARTaS). The CoNARTaS cohort was established by cross-linking National ART-, Medical Birth-, and National Patients Registers using the unique personal identification number, allocated to every citizen in the Nordic countries. Obstetric and perinatal outcomes after BT, CT and SC were compared using logistic regression analysis. For perinatal outcomes, we calculated gestational age based on the date of oocyte pick-up (OPU) and in sensitivity analyses on data from Denmark and Norway, we also calculated gestational age based on the second-trimester ultrasonography (US) scan. Risk of pregnancies with same-sex twins after SET was used as a proxy for risk of monozygotic twins. Adjustments were made for child's sex, birth year, parity (0 or >1), maternal age, body mass index, smoking, educational level, fertilization method (IVF/ICSI), the number of aspirated oocytes, SET and country. Information on educational level and the number of aspirated oocytes was not available for Norway. Children born after frozen embryo transfer were not included. The birth cohorts were restricted according to the year in which BT was introduced in the different countries.\nA higher risk of placenta previa was found in singleton pregnancies after BT compared with CT (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.11 [95% CI 1.76; 2.52]). Singletons born after BT had a higher risk of PTB (aOR 1.14 [95% CI 1.01; 1.29]) compared with CT singletons, when estimated based on OPU. Furthermore, an altered male/female ratio (aOR 1.13 [95% CI 1.06; 1.21]) with more males following BT compared with CT was seen. Risk of same-sex twins after SET was higher after single BT compared with single CT (aOR 1.94 [95% CI 1.42; 2.60]).\nResidual confounding cannot be excluded, in particular related to duration and cause of infertility that we could not adjust for due to lack of reliable data.\nExtended embryo culture to the blastocyst stage has the potential to compromise obstetric and perinatal outcomes in fresh cycles. These results are important since an increasing number of IVF/ICSI treatments are performed as BT.\nNORDFORSK (project no: 71450). The Research Fund of Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital.

    "abstract": "In contrast to gut, the oral microbiome of MS patients has not been characterized. Deep sequencing of saliva DNA from a pair of monozygotic twins (MSF1 with relapsing remitting MS; MSF2 with clinically isolated syndrome) identified 2036 bacterial species. Relative abundances of 3 phyla were higher, and 3 lower in MSF1 versus MSF2. Species diversity was greater in MSF2, and 20 abundant species differed at least 2-fold. Pathway analysis identified 116 functional hierarchies differing 50% or more. Although limited to one pair of twins, our data suggests that oral microbiome analysis may be useful for diagnosis or monitoring therapeutic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Whether genetic and familial factors influence the association between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unknown. Two cohorts were formed based on data from 1,212,295 men aged 18 years who were conscripted for military service in Sweden during 1972-1996. The first comprised 4,260 twin pairs in which the twins in each pair had different CRF (\u22651 watt). The second comprised 90,331 nonsibling pairs with different CRF and matched on birth year and year of conscription. Incident CVD and all-cause mortality were identified using national registers. During follow-up (median 32 years), there was no difference in CVD and mortality between fitter twins and less fit twins (246 vs. 251 events; hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a01.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83, 1.20). The risks were similar in twin pairs with \u226560-watt difference in CRF (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.96, 95% CI: 0.57, 1.64). In contrast, in the nonsibling cohort, fitter men had a lower risk of the outcomes than less fit men (4,444 vs. 5,298 events; HR\u00a0=\u00a00.83, 95% CI: 0.79, 0.86). The association was stronger in pairs with \u226560-watt difference in CRF (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.65, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.71). These findings indicate that genetic and familial factors influence the association of CRF with CVD and mortality.",

Only two cases of the simple virilising form of CAH have been reported previously, with variable clinical presentations. In this report, we describe a pair of monozygotic twins with classic simple virilising form of CAH, who had a simultaneous onset and similar severity of clinical manifestations. Genetic analysis of the CYP21A2 gene in twin 1 showed the pres-ence of two heterozygous pathogenic sequence variants, c.518T>A and c.955C>T in the CYP21A2 gene, consistent with a diagnosis of CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. We also present a brief review of previous cases of twins with CAH.",

    "abstract": "The fetal period has a critical and long-lasting impact on the regulation of metabolic processes and a life-long predisposition for obesity and metabolic syndrome. The exact mechanisms are unknown, but epigenetic regulation likely plays a major role. Twins represent an excellent model to study these mechanisms, as they share the same intrauterine environment and similar or even the same genetic information. We examined cord blood levels of adipocyte fatty-acid binding protein 4 (A-FABP or FABP4), a novel adipokine correlated with obesity and metabolic disease in children and adults.\nTo examine A-FABP levels in the cord blood of twins with concordant and discordant growth and in singletons with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).\nCohort study of 36 twin pairs (25 growth concordant and 11 growth discordant), and 42 singleton pregnancies (28 IUGR and 13 normally grown controls, 1 HELLP).\nCord blood A-FABP levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\nA-FABP levels were higher in the smaller of growth discordant dichorionic (DC) twins versus their co-twins (109.46\u2005\u00b1\u200562.80 ng/mL vs. 72.93\u2005\u00b1\u200536.66 ng/mL, \nIncreased A-FABP levels might be associated with an increased metabolic risk in growth-restricted (twins) and prematurely born infants.",

    "abstract": "Using vital statistics in Japan (1995-2008), 154,578 live-born twin pairs (128,236 monozygotic [MZ] and 180,920 dizygotic [DZ]) were identified. The proportion of severe discordance among live-born twin births was twice as high in Japanese than Caucasian infants. There were 1858 MZ and 1620 DZ infant deaths. Computation of the relationship between infant mortality rate and birth weight discordance among the twins was performed. Discordance levels were classified into seven groups: <5%, five groups from 5-9% to 25-29%, and \u226530%.The mortality rate was significantly higher in MZ than DZ twins for discordances except at 5-9% and 10-14%. The lowest rate for MZ twins was at 5-9% (7.5 per 1000 live twins) and significantly increased from 10-14% (9.4) to \u226530% (83.4), while the lowest rate for DZ twins was at <5% (6.7), which significantly increased at 10-14% (8.0) and from 25-29% (12.1) to \u226530% (35.5). The relationship was also computed in two gestational age groups (<28 and \u226528 weeks). For births at <28 weeks, three discordances (after 20-24%) in MZ twins were associated with adverse mortality rate. For births at \u226528 weeks, the same relationship was obtained after 10-14% in MZ and after 20-24% in DZ twins. The relationship from 2002 to 2008 showed that the mortality rates significantly increased after 10-14% for both types of twins. In conclusion, five discordance levels in MZ and three levels in DZ twins were associated with adverse mortality rates.",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive investigations over the last decade, preeclampsia remains an unpredictable pregnancy complication causing perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in twin pregnancies.\nThis study aimed to determine the relationship between growth discordance in twin pregnancies and the risk for preeclampsia based on chorionicity.\nThis was a retrospective single-center study that included 2122 women with twin pregnancies who were admitted to a tertiary hospital between January 2013 and June 2016. Growth discordance was defined as twin birthweight difference \u226520%. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between growth discordance and risk for gestational hypertension-preeclampsia in all subjects. Stratified sampling by twin chorionicity (dichorionic and monochorionic) was also conducted. Further analysis was performed to estimate the association between the degree of growth discordance and gestational hypertension-preeclampsia risk in monochorionic and dichorionic twin pregnancies.\nThe prevalence of growth discordance was 17.6%. In all subjects, growth discordance was associated with increased risk for gestational hypertension-preeclampsia. After stratification by twin chorionicity, growth discordance was associated with an increased risk for gestational hypertension preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.67) and preeclampsia (AOR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.21-2.73), including mild preeclampsia (AOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.02-3.37), severe preeclampsia (AOR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.06-2.97; P<.05), and early-onset preeclampsia (AOR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.40-6.32), in the dichorionic twin pregnancy group; however, no significant association was found in the monochorionic twin pregnancy group. A 10% increment of growth discordance in the dichorionic twin pregnancy group was associated with an elevated risk for gestational hypertension preeclampsia (AOR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02-1.41) and preeclampsia (AOR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.04-1.48), including severe preeclampsia (AOR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.04-1.59) and early-onset preeclampsia (AOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.08-2.00), but no significant association was found in the monochorionic twin pregnancy group.\nGrowth discordance is associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia in dichorionic but not in monochorionic twin pregnancy. In addition, the prevalence of preeclampsia increases significantly with increasing degree of growth discordance, reflecting a dose-response relationship in dichorionic twin pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Objective Little information exists related to the contribution of assisted reproductive technology (ART) twins to the preterm and very preterm birth rate. We sought to examine this contribution over a period of more than two decades in a tertiary perinatal center. Methods We identified all preterm births from 1993 to 2017, born at <37 or <32 weeks' gestation, by mode of conception [in vitro fertilization (IVF) vs. non-IVF pregnancies]. We generated trend lines of the annual change of the dependent variable (% preterm birth). Results We evaluated 74,299 births, including 3934 (5.3%) preterm births at <37 and 826 (1.1%) at <32 weeks' gestation. In this period, 1019 (1.4%) twin pairs were born including 475 (46.6%) and 80 (7.8%) at <37 and <32 weeks, respectively. There were 213 (5.4%) IVF pregnancies among the preterm births at <37 weeks, including 88 (41.3%) twins. Fifteen (1.8%) births of all IVF gestations were at <32 weeks, and all were twins. Whereas the annual rate of spontaneous twins did not change, a significant increase over time exists for IVF twins (P\u2009<\u20090.05, R2\u2009=\u20090.6). We demonstrated an increase in IVF twin births at <37 weeks but not for spontaneously conceived twins. Whereas the twin birth rate at <32 weeks did not change over time, all preterm births at <32 weeks following IVF were twins. Conclusions The risk of twins after ART increasingly contributes to preterm births at <37 weeks and ART twins are at significant risk for preterm births at <32 weeks.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are derived from the division of a single fertilized ovum; a phenomenon accompanied with multiple congenital anomalies. Such twins are identical, of the same sex, and more likely to be female. Most twins die during the embryonic period, and only 18% survive longer than 24 hours. There are complex anomalies in thoraco-omphalopagus twins that makes them unlikely to live long enough to undergo separation. Treatment of this uncommon condition presents both surgical and anesthetic challenges. The management of rare anomalies is difficult even for skilled surgeons. Therefore, it is logical to use the knowledge gained from previous experiences. We herein present the first successful surgical separation of two pairs of thoraco-omphalopagus conjoined twins at the Pediatric Surgery Center of Namazi Hospital (Shiraz, Iran). In both cases, the neonates had separate hearts and common pericardium. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of two sets of twins showed fusion of sternum, pericardium, diaphragm, and left lobe of liver. Critical steps of the surgical separation were identified and contingency plans were made for possible partial liver donation and cross-circulation between twins. The separation procedure and reconstruction of the abdominal wall were successfully performed. Both pairs of twins, now 6- and 8-year-old, are healthy and have normal growth and are under follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is a major cause of hearing loss in children. A few cases of cCMV twin pregnancies are reported in the literature. Twins can react differently to maternal infection, but hearing loss is rarely evaluated. Two couples of twins with cCMV infection and different audiologic outcomes are reported. The first couple of twins was composed by two male twins, both affected by cCMV infection. The first born had normal hearing function, and the second born had sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). In the second couple, a male and a female twin, only the male twin was affected by cCMV infection, and both had normal hearing function. In this case series, an interesting finding was the association between the presence of viral DNA in liquor and hearing loss in one newborn. Further research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology of SNHL caused by cCMV infection.",

    "abstract": "Allomaternal care is widely observed among primate species. Although diverse allomothering behavioral repertoire and types of caretakers have been reported, it remains unclear what social or physiological conditions may trigger such care in each individual. For a better understanding of mechanisms that give rise to allomaternal care in primates, more observational reports are needed with information on social or physiological conditions of caretakers. Here I report two cases of intensive allomaternal care in two different populations of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). The two adult females provided intensive allomaternal care including carrying, grooming, and nursing towards others' infants. Their allomaternal care began 20 or 29\u00a0days prior to their own partum and lasted for 84\u00a0days at the most. This study firstly showed that nursing forms part of the allomothering behavioral repertoire, and allomaternal caretakers can be individuals that are prior to the time of their own partum in Japanese macaques. Their intensive allomaternal care may stem from their good nutritional conditions, increased concentrations of several hormones, or disappearance of the newborn infants' biological mothers.",

    "abstract": "Cystic maculopathy has been associated with genetic disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa, X-linked retinoschisis, cone dystrophy, and foveal retinoschisis. Familial foveal retinoschisis was recently described as a rare disease caused by CRB1 variants. The authors report the phenotype-genotype pattern of a pair of dizygotic twins with early-onset cystic maculopathy due to CRB1 pathogenic variants. The twins were conceived by heterologous fertilization with variant-carrying oocytes. The probands were monitored for a period of 4 years. Next generation sequencing of a panel of genes responsible for retinal dystrophies was performed. Both children carried three pathogenic variants in CRB1: a novel heterozygous truncating variant p.(Val855*) inherited from the father and two known heterozygous missense variants, p.[(Phe144Val; Thr745Met)], inherited from the oocyte donor. The findings confirm that CRB1 variants can be responsible for foveal retinoschisis with variable clinical expressivity ranging from schitic macular alteration to early-onset forms of cystic maculopathy. The authors highlight the importance of exome analysis of gamete donors to assess the likelihood of recessively inherited disorders by means of a prediction algorithm able to combine parent and donor exome data.

    "abstract": "Several factors contribute to neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants. The aim of this study was to examine the genetic and environmental influences on long-term outcomes in preterm twins.\nFrom a prospective cohort of 225 preterm neonates studied with MRI, 24 monozygotic and 52 dizygotic twins were included. Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 1.5 and 3 years were assessed with the Bayley-III and at 4.5 years with The Movement Assessment Battery for Children and The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III.\nPreterm monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs (N\u2009=\u200976 neonates) had similar neurodevelopmental outcomes at all time points. Monozygotic twins (N\u2009=\u200924) did not show greater agreement for outcomes relative to dizygotic twins (N\u2009=\u200952). Twin pairs who were discordant in development (N\u2009=\u200912) were born at a lower gestational age and had a higher incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity. Discordant twins become more similar in cognitive and language outcomes over time.\nNeurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm twins may relate more strongly to environmental factors than genetics. Discordant twins were born earlier and had more perinatal morbidities. Despite the initial discordance, these twin pairs become similar in outcomes over time, which may reflect the positive impact of home environment or early intervention programs.\nNeurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm twins relate more strongly to environmental factors than genetics. Monozygotic twins did not show greater agreement in outcomes relative to dizygotic twins suggesting a stronger environmental, rather than genetic, influence on development. Twin pairs who were discordant in development were born at a lower gestational age and had a higher incidence of perinatal morbidities.

Neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm twins are influenced by exposure to early-life insults or environmental stressors. The initial variability in outcomes among preterm infants is not fixed, and efforts made post-discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit can have a substantial impact on long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This Essay highlights the complex issue of twinning in science publications. Historical accounts present cases where two scientists focused on the same problem and came up with the same solution following different paths. This has changed in the present day. The concurrent publication of rather similar research papers from different groups has increased in frequency since 2010. In the past, twinning in research publications was serendipitous, and there was a healthy competition among teams working on similar projects. Today, twinning has become more frequent. This can be attributed to the urge of researchers to have publications on popular topics, the tendency to base research programs on popular keywords, and funding agencies preferentially supporting certain areas of research. With vast amounts of literature being generated, editorial offices and referees may not be able to find these twins very easily. As we inch away from human ingenuity towards artificial intelligence, twinning may become even more frequent.",

    "abstract": "Twin infants are likely at great risk for ROP, but studies reported conflicting findings and population studies examining the risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in twins is limited. We aimed to evaluate the ROP risk in the cohort of one of twins, comparing to singletons.\nUsing insurance claims data of a half of children in Taiwan ages 18 and less, we established a twin cohort (N = 27830) born in 1998-2009 and a randomly selected singleton cohort (N = 111080) frequency matched by sex, birth year, residential area and parental occupation and followed up to 2012 years.\nThe overall incidence rate of ROP was 13.6-fold greater in the twin cohort than in the singleton cohort (35.1 vs. 2.58 per 10,000 person-years; adjusted HR = 13.4, 95% CI = 11.7-15.3; p <0.0001). The ROP incidence was slightly higher in boys than in girls, higher in children in more urbanized areas and born to mothers without works. The incident ROP increased with decreasing birthweight. For children with birthweight <1000 grams, the ROP incidence was 1.2-fold greater in the twin cohort than in the singleton cohort (1243.2 vs. 1016.3 per 10,000 person-years). The use of mechanical ventilation was associated with increased ROP risk for both cohorts, particularly for infants who were under invasive treatment.\nInfants who were born as twins or born with low birthweight were at an elevated risk of developing ROP. Extreme cautious and close monitor are required for new born with low birthweight and have undergone with mechanical ventilation.",

    "abstract": "Physical examinations are recommended as part of a comprehensive evaluation for individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. These examinations should include assessment for morphological variants. Previous studies have shown an increase in morphological variants in individuals with NDDs, particularly ASD, and that these variants may be present in greater amounts in individuals with genetic alterations. Unfortunately, assessment for morphological variants can be subjective and time-consuming, and require a high degree of clinical expertise. Therefore, objective, automated methods of morphological assessment are desirable. This study compared the use of Face2Gene, an automated tool to explore facial morphological variants, to clinical consensus assessment, using a cohort of N = 290 twins enriched for NDDs (n = 135 with NDD diagnoses). Agreement between automated and clinical assessments were satisfactory to complete (78.3-100%). In our twin sample, individuals with NDDs did not have greater numbers of facial morphological variants when compared to those with typical development, nor when controlling for shared genetic and environmental factors within twin pairs. Common facial morphological variants in those with and without NDDs were similar and included thick upper lip vermilion, abnormality of the nasal tip, long face, and upslanted palpebral fissure. We conclude that although facial morphological variants can be assessed reliably in NDDs with automated tools like Face2Gene, clinical utility is limited when just exploring the facial region. Therefore, currently, automated assessments may best complement, rather than replace, in-person clinical assessments.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies account for 3% of live births but experience substantially more perinatal morbidity and mortality than singleton pregnancies. Optimizing the timing of birth is a key strategy in improving twin pregnancy outcomes. Current UK and US policies are based on observational studies of perinatal mortality and not on longer-term effects. The association of timing of birth with long-term childhood outcomes among twins is uncertain.\nTo identify the optimal gestation week for birth of twin infants by calculating the week of birth associated with the lowest risk of short-term and long-term adverse outcomes (perinatal mortality and special educational need [SEN] at school).\nThis population-based, data-linkage cohort study included 43 133 twin infants born at a gestational age of 34 weeks onward between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2015, in Scotland. The data were analyzed from June 1, 2017, to March 1, 2019.\nGestational age (in weeks) at the time of birth.\nThe primary outcomes were extended perinatal mortality and a record of SEN (\u22651 of intellectual disabilities, dyslexia, physical or motor impairment, language or speech disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, and social, emotional, or behavioral difficulties) at school (children aged 4-18 years). To infer the consequence of the gestational age at birth, clinical outcomes of twin infants born at each week of gestation from 34 weeks onward were compared with those of twin infants remaining in utero thereafter.\nOf the total 43 133 twin infants included in the study, 21 696 (50.3%) were females. Although maternity records were available for all infants, 9519 sex-discordant twin children were linked to their educational data, of whom 1069 (13.8%) had a record of SEN. Compared with twins remaining in utero (n\u2009=\u200926\u202f172), birth at any gestational age from 34 to 37 weeks was associated with increased odds of perinatal death (ie, adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.99; 95% CI, 1.53-2.69 at 36 weeks [n\u2009=\u20098056]) and increased risk of SEN at school (AOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.11-1.74, for birth at 36 weeks compared with 37 weeks). In a competing risk analysis, the risks of stillbirth and neonatal death were balanced at 37 weeks (risk difference, 2.05; 95% CI, 0.8-3.3).\nThe findings of this study suggest that, in the absence of a medical complication, twins should not be routinely delivered before 37 completed weeks of gestation. These findings may help optimize shared decision-making around the timing of twin birth.",

Although maternity records were available for all infants, 9519 sex-discordant twin children were linked to their educational data, of whom 1069 (13.8%) had a record of SEN. Compared with twins remaining in utero (n\u2009=\u200926\u202f172), birth at any gestational age from 34 to 37 weeks was associated with increased odds of perinatal death (ie, adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.99; 95% CI, 1.53-2.69 at 36 weeks [n\u2009=\u20098056]) and increased risk of SEN at school (AOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.11-1.74, for birth at 36 weeks compared with 37 weeks). In a competing risk analysis, the risks of stillbirth and neonatal death were balanced at 37 weeks (risk difference, 2.05; 95% CI, 0.8-3.3).",

    "abstract": "We present a set of twins discordant for low-level mosaic trisomy 17\u00a0at amniocentesis, and we review the literature of heterokaryotypic monozygotic twins at amniocentesis.\nWe describe a monozygotic twin pregnancy with discordant karyotypes and structural abnormalities. A 22-year-old, primigravid woman underwent amniocentesis at 21 weeks of gestation because of an abnormal maternal serum screening result for Down syndrome. Prenatal ultrasound revealed twin-twin transfusion syndrome but no detectable fetal structural abnormalities. Conventional cytogenetic analysis was applied on cultured amniocytes and parental bloods. Polymorphic DNA marker analysis by quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) testing was performed on the DNAs extracted from cultured amniocytes, parental bloods and peripheral bloods of the twins after birth. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on buccal mucosal epithelial cells.\nAmniocentesis revealed a karyotype of 47,XX,+17 [3]/46,XX [23] in twin A and a karyotype of 46,XX in twin B. The parental karyotypes were normal. QF-PCR confirmed monozygotic twinning and excluded uniparental disomy (UPD) 17. At 35 weeks of gestation, a 1778-g twin A and a 2396-g twin B were delivered smoothly. Both infants had the karyotype of 46,XX in the peripheral bloods and were phenotypically normal except that twin A had preaxial polydactyly on the right hand. Postnatal QF-PCR testing confirmed monozygotic twinning. The infants were doing well at age 2 years and 7\u00a0months\u00a0at follow-ups with normal physical and psychomotor development. FISH analysis on buccal mucosal epithelial cells showed trisomy 17 signals in 4.16% (4/96) cells, compared with 5% (5/101\u00a0cells) in normal control.\nMonozygotic twins discordant for low-level mosaic trisomy 17\u00a0at amniocentesis without ultrasound abnormalities can have a favorable outcome. Prenatal diagnosis of twins discordant for structural abnormalities and/or chromosomal aberrations should alert the possibility of monozygotic twinning, and QF-PCR testing is useful for rapid determination of zygosity and exclusion of UPD under such a circumstance.",

    "abstract": "Major obstetrics and gynecology societies offer inconsistent recommendation regarding optimal delivery timing in uncomplicated dizygotic twins. We sought to investigate the impact of delivery timing within term gestation, in dizygotic twins, on the short- and long-term offspring morbidity. A prospectively analyzed cohort of dizygotic twin deliveries was conducted. All women delivered at a regional tertiary medical center, at term (\u226537 0/7), between the years 1991 and 2014, were included. The primary exposure was delivery at 37 0/7-37 + 6/7 weeks, while delivery at \u226538 0/7 weeks' gestation was considered the reference. Neonatal short- and long-term outcomes according to hospitalizations of offspring up to 18 years of age due to cardiac, respiratory, hematological, neurological, and infectious morbidity were compared. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to compare cumulative incidences per each major-system hospitalization. Cox regression models were used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios, while adjusting for variables with clinical importance. During the study period, 612 dizygotic twin deliveries met the inclusion criteria. Of them, 200 (31.3%) occurred at 37-37 6/7 weeks, and 412 (68.7%) occurred at \u226538 0/7 weeks' gestation. In the long-term analysis, rates of hospitalizations involving several major morbidity categories exhibited comparable rates in both groups. The Cox regression models did not demonstrate an independent association between gestational age within term and later major pediatric morbidity in offspring (total long-term morbidity: adjusted hazard ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 0.77-2.29). Dizygotic twin deliveries occurring at different gestational ages within term do not appear to significantly impact on major short- and long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In light of the development of \"CRISPR\" technology, new promising advances in therapeutic and preventive approaches have become a reality. However, with it came many ethical challenges. The most recent worldwide condemnation of the first use of CRISPR to genetically modify a human embryo is the latest example of ethically questionable use of this new and emerging field. Monotheistic religions are very conservative about such changes to the human genome and can be considered an interference with God's creation. Moreover, these changes could cause perpetual changes to future generations. The Muslim scholars establish their decisions by addressing five foundations of Islamic law i.e. \"maq\u0101\u1e63id al shar\u0131\u0304`a\"; the purposes of the law. These are d\u0131n\u0304 (religion), nafs (life), nasl (progeny), `aql (intellect) and m\u0101l (wealth). To achieve this, the five principles should all be met before approval of an experiment like the Chinese embryo modifications; Qa\u1e63d (intention) which is achieved in this case as it aims to protect the embryo from HIV. Yaq\u0131n\u0304 (certainty) and \u1e0carar (injury) were not satisfied as they require strong scientific certainty of the procedures, and evidence of safety. \u1e0car\u016bra (necessity) by which the alternatives being compared; in this case more established and proven safe alternatives to protect the HIV transmission from the father are available, so this principle is not met. The final principle is `Urf (custom), by which the social context of using any contemporary technology should be taken in consideration, and clearly this was not achieved. Collectively, germline changes are rejected from an Islamic perspective until the five principles are fulfilled. In the Chinese Twins gene editing case, there was clearly no justification or support for it according to the Muslim Jurisprudence laws. These laws and approaches can serve as an ethical checklist for such controversial research, especially in early stages of the research.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of the upper and lower motor neurons. Approximately 10% of cases are caused by specific mutations in known genes, with the remaining cases having no known genetic link. As such, sporadic cases have been more difficult to model experimentally. Here, we describe the generation and differentiation of ALS induced pluripotent stem cells reprogrammed from discordant identical twins. Whole genome sequencing revealed no relevant mutations in known ALS-causing genes that differ between the twins. As protein aggregation is found in all ALS patients and is thought to contribute to motor neuron death, we sought to characterize the aggregation phenotype of the sporadic ALS induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Motor neurons from both twins had high levels of insoluble proteins that commonly aggregate in ALS that did not robustly change in response to exogenous glutamate. In contrast, established genetic ALS iPSC lines demonstrated insolubility in a protein- and genotype-dependent manner. Moreover, whereas the genetic ALS lines failed to induce autophagy after glutamate stress, motor neurons from both twins and independent controls did activate this protective pathway. Together, these data indicate that our unique model of sporadic ALS may provide key insights into disease pathology and highlight potential differences between sporadic and familial ALS.",

    "abstract": "Depressive episodes experienced in unipolar (UD) and bipolar (BD) disorders are characterized by anhedonia and have been associated with abnormalities in reward processes related to reward valuation and error prediction. It remains however unclear whether these deficits are associated with familial vulnerability to mood disorders.\nIn a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we evaluated differences in the expected value (EV) and reward prediction error (RPE) signals in ventral striatum (VS) and prefrontal cortex between three groups of monozygotic twins: affected twins in remission for either UD or BD (n = 53), their high-risk unaffected co-twins (n = 34), and low-risk twins with no family history of mood disorders (n = 25).\nCompared to low-risk twins, affected twins showed lower EV signal bilaterally in the frontal poles and lower RPE signal bilaterally in the VS, left frontal pole and superior frontal gyrus. The high-risk group did not show a significant change in the EV or RPE signals in frontostriatal regions, yet both reward signals were consistently lower compared with low-risk twins in all regions where the affected twins showed significant reductions.\nOur findings strengthen the notion that reduced valuation of expected rewards and reduced error-dependent reward learning may underpin core symptom of depression such as loss of interest in rewarding activities. The trend reduction in reward-related signals in unaffected co-twins warrants further investigation of this effect in larger samples and prospective follow-up to confirm possible association with increased familial vulnerability to mood disorders.",

The trend reduction in reward-related signals in unaffected co-twins warrants further investigation of this effect in larger samples and prospective follow-up to confirm possible association with increased familial vulnerability to mood disorders.",

    "abstract": "Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for the first six months after birth has been recommended by the WHO as the best infant feeding strategy. Data on EBF rates among twin infants in Ghana remain limited and for that matter hypothesized to be low.\nThe study sought to measure the prevalence of EBF and identify associated factors among twins in the Tamale metropolis.\nA cross-sectional survey involving 185 mother-twin pairs was conducted in four health facilities in the Tamale metropolis providing Child welfare Clinic (CWC) services. Socio-demographics data on both mother and twin were taken. Biomedical (e.g. perceived onset of lactation, confidence of producing enough milk, parity, delivery place, delivery type, time of breastfeeding initiation) and bio cultural factors (e.g. family cooperation for current infant feeding, breastfeeding counselling) were also obtained. In-depth interviews were also conducted with a sub sample of mothers (30) who were purposively selected to generate qualitative data on breastfeeding and associated cultural factors in twins as this data was necessary to aid in the explanation of the quantitative results.\nOnly 17% of twin infants were exclusively breastfed for six months. Women who were not confident that they could produce enough breast milk were about 83% less likely to practice exclusive breast-feeding (EBF) compared to those who were confident that they could produce enough breast milk (AOR\u2009=\u20090.17; CI\u2009=\u20090.04, 0.73; \nThe study shows that, ownership of radio, confidence of producing enough breast milk and admission of the children into NICU were identified as the most important factors affecting exclusive breastfeeding of twins. Beyond Educating, encouraging and assuring twin mothers of their abilities to produce enough breast milk to satisfy their children, healthcare professionals should pay more attention on providing appropriate information on breastfeeding to mothers and caregivers.",

    "abstract": "As DNA sequencing and synthesis become cheaper and more easily accessible, the scale and complexity of biological engineering projects is set to grow. Yet, although there is an accelerating convergence between biotechnology and digital technology, a deficit in software and laboratory techniques diminishes the ability to make biotechnology more agile, reproducible, and transparent while, at the same time, limiting the security and safety of synthetic biology constructs. To partially address some of these problems, this paper presents an approach for physically linking engineered cells to their digital footprint-we called it digital twinning. This enables the tracking of the entire engineering history of a cell line in a specialized version control system for collaborative strain engineering ",

    "abstract": "This study generates a series of narrow-sense heritability estimates for crown morphology of the deciduous and permanent dentition with two overarching aims. The first is to test the hypothesis that deciduous teeth provide a more faithful reflection of genetic information than their permanent successors. The second is to use quantitative genetic methods to evaluate assumptions underlying common data collection and analysis practices in biodistance research.\nDental morphology data were collected from longitudinal dental casts representing Australian twins and families using Arizona State Dental Anthropology System standards. Polygenic models and estimates of narrow-sense heritability were generated using SOLAR v.8.1.1. Each model considered age, sex, and age/sex interaction as covariates.\nHeritability estimates significantly differed from zero for the majority of morphological crown characters. Most estimates fell within the 0.4-0.8 range typically observed for crown morphology. Mean heritability was stable across the dental complex, but for paired homologues, permanent traits often yielded higher estimates than their deciduous counterparts. Results indicate directional asymmetry in environmental influence for crown morphology and inform biodistance \"best practices\" related to data collection and treatment.\nOverall, results for this sample support the use of crown morphology as a proxy for genetic variation in evolutionary research. This includes the deciduous dentition, which justifies the expansion of efforts to incorporate subadults into reconstructions of past microevolutionary processes. Results do not indicate that deciduous phenotypes more closely approximate underlying genotype, at least for deciduous/permanent homologues.",

    "abstract": "Does fetal reduction of triplet pregnancies to singleton result in superior obstetric and neonatal outcomes compared with triplets reduced to twins?\nA historical cohort study including 285 trichorionic and dichorionic triplet pregnancies that underwent abdominal fetal reduction at 11-14 weeks in a single tertiary referral centre. The study population comprised two groups: reduction to twins (n\u202f=\u202f223) and singletons (n\u202f=\u202f62). Main outcome measures were rates of pregnancy complications, preterm delivery and neonatal outcomes. Non-parametric statistical methods were employed.\nTriplet pregnancies reduced to twins delivered earlier (36 versus 39 weeks, P < 0.001) with higher prevalence of Caesarean section (71.1% versus 32.2%, P < 0.001) compared with triplets reduced to singletons. Preterm delivery rates were significantly higher in twins compared with singletons prior to 37 weeks (56.9% versus 13.6%, P < 0.001), 34 weeks (20.2% versus 3.4%, P\u202f=\u202f0.002) and 32 weeks (9.6% versus 0%, P\u202f=\u202f0.01). No significant difference was found in the rate of pregnancy loss before 24 weeks (1.3% in twins versus 4.8% in singletons, P\u202f=\u202f0.12) or in the rate of intrauterine fetal death after 24 weeks (0.4% versus 0%, P\u202f=\u202f1.0). Both groups had comparable obstetrical complications and neonatal outcomes, except for higher rates of neonatal intensive care unit admission in twins (31.9% versus 6.8%, P < 0.001).\nReduction of triplets to singletons rather than twins resulted in superior obstetric outcomes without increasing the procedure-related complications. However, because the rate of extreme prematurity in pregnancies reduced to twins was low, the overall outcome of those pregnancies was favourable. Therefore, the option of reduction to singletons should be considered in cases where the risk of prematurity seems exceptionally high.",

    "abstract": "To compare the short- and mid-term outcomes of preterm twins by chorionicity of pregnancy.\nProspective nationwide population-based EPIPAGE-2 cohort study.\n546 maternity units in France, between March and December 2011.\nA total of 1700 twin neonates born between 24 and 34\u00a0weeks of gestation.\nThe association of chorionicity with outcomes was analysed using multivariate regression models.\nFirst, survival at 2-year corrected age with or without neurosensory impairment, and second, perinatal, short-, and mid-term outcomes (survival at discharge, survival at discharge without severe morbidity) were described and compared by chorionicity.\nIn the EPIPAGE 2 cohort, 1700 preterm births were included (850 twin pregnancies). In all, 1220 (71.8%) were from dichorionic (DC) pregnancies and 480 from monochorionic (MC) pregnancies. MC pregnancies had three times more medical terminations than DC pregnancies (1.67 versus 0.51%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), whereas there were three times more stillbirths in MC than in DC pregnancies (10.09 versus 3.78%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Both twins were alive at birth in 86.6% of DC pregnancies compared with 80.0% among MC pregnancies (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008). No significant difference according to chorionicity was found regarding neonatal deaths and morbidities. Likewise, for children born earlier than 32\u00a0weeks, the 2-year follow-up neurodevelopmental results were not significantly different between DC and MC twins.\nThis study confirms that MC pregnancies have a higher risk of adverse outcomes. However, the outcomes among preterm twins admitted to neonatal intensive care units are similar irrespective of chorionicity.\nMonochorionicity is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, but outcomes for preterm twins are comparable irrespective of their chorionicity.",

    "abstract": "Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are non-coding RNAs involved in RNA modification and processing. Approximately half of the so far identified snoRNA genes map within the intronic regions of host genes, and their expression, as well as the expression of their host genes, is dependent on transcript splicing and maturation. Growing evidence indicates that mutations and/or deregulations that affect snoRNAs, as well as host genes, play a significant role in oncogenesis. Among the possible factors underlying snoRNA/host gene expression deregulation is copy number alteration (CNA). We analyzed the data available in The Cancer Genome Atlas database, relative to CNA and expression of 295 snoRNA/host gene couples in 10 cancer types, to understand whether the genetic or expression alteration of snoRNAs and their matched host genes would have overlapping trends. Our results show that, counterintuitively, copy number and expression alterations of snoRNAs and matched host genes are not necessarily coupled. In addition, some snoRNA/host genes are mutated and overexpressed recurrently in multiple cancer types. Our findings suggest that the differential contribution to cancer development of both snoRNAs and host genes should always be considered, and that snoRNAs and their host genes may contribute to cancer development in conjunction or independently.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is a recently described, clinically significant entity, with prevalence rates ranging from 1% to 14% and a mean of 6% of all patients with myocardial infarction. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS; Hughes syndrome) is characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies associated with thrombosis (arterial and/or venous) and/or pregnancy morbidity and could be the cause of MINOCA. Data on genetic predisposition to APS are scarce. The present study describes a unique case of monozygotic twin brothers who, at a young age, developed the same clinical presentation of APS. The diagnosis of APS was later confirmed, along with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in one brother.",

    "abstract": "In this essay, the bioethical implications of the recent genetic manipulation in human embryos with CRISPR-Cas9 to eliminate the CCR5 gene and the birth of a pair of discordant twin girls are analyzed. The experiment was disseminated via social media. The main bioethical flaws identified include the justification of the model, the informed consent process and the lack of disclosure of evident conflicts of interest. The consequences of the experiment on the life of the twins that were born were not properly evaluated, such as the impact on their autonomy, the alleged benefits to be received and the future risks of harm during their lifetime. Having manipulated the germ cell line, the effects on their future offspring were not considered. This type of actions negatively affects the way society conceives science. Genetic engineering should be reserved to the basic experimental context or as clinical research for the correction of known serious diseases of genetic origin under strict regulatory and bioethical supervision and using a gradualist approach in accordance with the advances of gene editing techniques.\nEn este ensayo se analizan las implicaciones bio\u00e9ticas de la reciente manipulaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica en embriones humanos con CRISPR-Cas9 para eliminar el gen CCR5 y el nacimiento de dos gemelas discordantes. El experimento se divulg\u00f3 en medios sociales. Los principales problemas bio\u00e9ticos identificados son la justificaci\u00f3n del modelo, el proceso de consentimiento informado y la falta de declaraci\u00f3n de evidentes conflictos de inter\u00e9s. No se evaluaron apropiadamente las consecuencias del experimento sobre la vida de las gemelas nacidas como la afectaci\u00f3n a su autonom\u00eda, los supuestos beneficios por recibir y los riesgos futuros de da\u00f1o durante su vida.

Este tipo de acciones tiene un impacto negativo en la forma como la sociedad concibe la ciencia.

    "abstract": "Sleep apnea is one of the most common sleep disorders and it is related to multiple negative health consequences. Previous studies have shown that sleep apnea is influenced by genetic factors. However, studies have not investigated the genetic and environmental influences of symptoms of sleep apnea in young adults. Furthermore, the underpinnings of the relationship between apnea symptoms and internalizing/externalizing problems are unknown. The objectives of this study were to estimate the magnitude of: (1) genetic and environmental influences on self-reported apnea symptoms; (2) the relationship between self-reported apnea symptoms and internalizing/externalizing traits; (3) genetic and environmental influences on the associations between self-reported apnea symptoms, internalizing behaviors and externalizing behaviors.\nIn a twin/sibling study, univariate and multivariate models were fitted to estimate both individual variance and sources of covariance between symptoms of sleep apnea and internalizing/externalizing behaviors.\nOur results show that genetic influences account for 40% of the variance in sleep apnea symptoms. Moreover, there are modest associations between depression, anxiety and externalizing behaviors with apnea symptoms (ranging from r = 0.22-0.29). However, the origins of these associations differ. For example, whereas most of the covariation between symptoms of depression and sleep apnea can be explained by genes (95%), there was a larger role for the environment (53%) in the association between symptoms of anxiety and sleep apnea.\nGenetic factors explain a significant proportion of variance in symptoms of apnea and most of the covariance with depression.",

    "abstract": "Balanced de novo non-robertsonian translocations (non-RTs), which involve acrocentric chromosomes, are rare findings in clinical cytogenetics and may be associated with an abnormal phenotype. These translocations, detected by conventional karyotyping, are found in approximately 1:1,000 neonates. In most of these cases, one of the parents carries the same translocation. In this study, we report a rare non-RT involving chromosomes 15 and 22 defined as 45, XX, -22,der(15;22)t(15;22)/46, XX, der(15)t(15;22),der(22). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a non-RT t(15;22) with these breakpoints.",

    "abstract": "Necrotizing soft tissue infection of the ear following ear piercing is a very rare condition. It is easily misdiagnosed leading to reconstructive morbidities and mortality in neonates. High clinical suspicion is important for early diagnosis. Our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature in this unique initial presentation. We hope to heighten the awareness of necrotizing soft tissue infection of the ear following ear piercing to ensure early aggressive intervention.\nWe report a set of 19-day-old female twin neonates who developed bilateral ear sores following ear piercing in a primary healthcentre without adherence to surgical asepsis. Examination findings showed features consistent with necrotizing soft tissue infections of the ears. They were successfully managed with antibiotics and wound care.\nNecrotizing soft tissue infections is a very rare complication of neonatal ear piercing. It may occur following suboptimal aseptic procedure and a high index of suspicion is necessary to make this diagnosis to ensure early intervention and to forestall the potential reconstructive morbidities and mortality associated with late recognition. Adherence to basic aseptic surgical principles is the key to prevention of necrotizing soft tissue infections.",

    "abstract": "To study the association between intrauterine growth and visual pathways maturation by neonatal visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in twins, in view of a possible prognostic role.\nSeventy-four twin neonates from 37 pregnancies were selected based on gestational age of more than 30\u00a0weeks and uneventful perinatal clinical course. Flash VEPs were recorded at the same postmenstrual age in each twin pair. The association between P2 latency and anthropometric variables at birth was analyzed by comparison within each twin pair and regarding each variable as ordered difference between the two twins.\nAnalysis of differences within each twin pair highlighted that inter-twin difference in P2 latency was significantly related to difference in ponderal index (PI) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.048). Expressing the difference in latency as a categorical binary variable, the correlation was significant for both difference in PI, (median difference\u00a0=\u00a0-0.36, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.14, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and difference in body mass index (BMI), (median difference\u00a0=\u00a0-1.06, 95% CI -1.74 to -0.29, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006).\nLower values of PI and BMI differences are associated to delayed VEP latency in twin pairs.\nVEP latency suggests reduced myelination of visual pathways when difference in growth pattern occurs in twins.",

    "abstract": "Neurodevelopment is sensitive to genetic and pre/postnatal environmental influences. These effects are likely mediated by epigenetic factors, yet current knowledge is limited. Longitudinal twin studies can delineate the link between genetic and environmental factors, epigenetic state at birth and neurodevelopment later in childhood. Building upon our study of the Peri/postnatal Epigenetic Twin Study (PETS) from gestation to 6 years of age, here we describe the PETS 11-year follow-up in which we will use neuroimaging and cognitive testing to examine the relationship between early-life environment, epigenetics and neurocognitive outcomes in mid-childhood. Using a within-pair twin model, the primary aims are to (1) identify early-life epigenetic correlates of neurocognitive outcomes; (2) determine the developmental stability of epigenetic effects and (3) identify modifiable environmental risk factors. Secondary aims are to identify factors influencing gut microbiota between 6 and 11 years of age to investigate links between gut microbiota and neurodevelopmental outcomes in mid-childhood. Approximately 210 twin pairs will undergo an assessment at 11 years of age. This includes a direct child cognitive assessment, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging, biological sampling, anthropometric measurements and a range of questionnaires on health and development, behavior, dietary habits and sleeping patterns. Data from complementary data sources, including the National Assessment Program - Literacy and Numeracy and the Australian Early Development Census, will also be sought. Following on from our previous focus on relationships between growth, cardiovascular health and oral health, this next phase of PETS will significantly advance our understanding of the environmental interactions that shape the developing brain.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the utility of social media to distribute a patient survey on differences in management and outcomes of monochorionic-diamniotic (MCDA) pregnancies.\nA cross-sectional survey was posted to an English-language MCDA twins patient-centered support group within the social media site, Facebook from April 2, 2018 to June 26, 2018. Subjects were recruited through a technique called \"snowballing,\" whereby individuals shared the survey to assist with recruiting. Patient reported data were analyzed using Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis's tests to explore characteristics associated with surveillance and outcomes as related to region and provider type.\nOver 3 months, the post \"reached\" 14,288 Facebook users, among which 5,653 (40%) clicked on the post. A total of 2,357 respondents with MCDA pregnancies completed the survey. Total 1,928 (82%) were from the United States (US) and 419 (18%) from other countries. Total 85% of patients had co-management with maternal-fetal medicine (MFM), more in the US compared with the rest of the world (87 vs. 74%, \nA survey distributed via social media can be effective in evaluating real-life management and outcomes of an uncommon obstetrical diagnosis.

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are one of the most fascinating human malformations. Here, we report the anesthetic management and challenges faced in performing the successful separation surgery of 4-day-old thoraco-omphalopagus conjoined twins, born at term to a multigravida by elective caesarean section weighing 3.5 kg with APGAR score of more than 7. Computerized tomography scan revealed fused anterior surface of the left lobe of liver with common left portal vein. Confirmation of cross-circulation between the twins was done by giving intravenous midazolam to one of the conjoined twins, but no effect seen in the other one. We highlighted the responsibility of anesthesia team in anesthetizing sequentially the two patients who are joined together, technical difficulty of intubating the twins facing each other, need of careful monitoring, anticipation of complications such as massive blood loss, hemodynamic instability, desaturation, and hypothermia, and preparedness for their management and vigilant postoperative care.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the association between neonatal complications and neurophysiological development in twins at 18 and 48-60 months of age.\nThis was a secondary analysis of 841 Danish mono- and dichorionic diamniotic twins from a randomized controlled trial (PREDICT study), which included an assessment of the twin's neurophysiological development using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) that had been filled out by the parents at 18 and 48 or 60 months. The correlation within twin pairs was accounted for by the method of generalized estimating equation. Models were adjusted for maternal educational score and gestational age at delivery.\nASQ data were available for 823 children at 18 months and 425 children at 48 or 60 months. Low maternal educational score and preterm delivery <34\u2009weeks were associated with a lower ASQ score at 48-60 months (-15.4 points (95%CI -26.4; -4.5) and -13.2 points (95%CI -23.8; -2.5), respectively). Neonatal sepsis and a compound of intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity and necrotizing enterocolitis (IVH/ROP/NEC) were associated with lower ASQ score at 18 months (-15.3 points (95%CI -28.1; -2.5) and -30.8 points (95%CI -59.5; -2.1), respectively). Children with IVH/ROP/NEC had a lower ASQ score at 48-60 months (-34.2 points (95%CI -67.9; -0.6)). The associations were not specific to only one ASQ domain.\nSeveral neonatal complications are associated with poorer neurophysiological development in twins during childhood, even after adjustment for gestational age at delivery.",

    "abstract": "Scholarly literature claims that health declines in populations when optimism about investing in the future wanes. This claim leads us to describe collective optimism as a predictor of selection in utero. Based on the literature, we argue that the incidence of suicide gauges collective optimism in a population and therefore willingness to invest in the future. Using monthly data from Sweden for the years 1973-2016, we test the hypothesis that the incidence of suicide among women of child-bearing age correlates inversely with male twin births, an indicator of biological investment in high-risk gestations. We find that, as predicted by our theory, the incidence of suicide at month t varies inversely with the ratio of twin to singleton male births at month t + 3. Our results illustrate the likely sensitivity of selection in utero to change in the social environment and so the potential for viewing collective optimism as a component of public health infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "In 1984, Hrubec and Robinette published what was arguably the first review of the role of twins in medical research. The authors acknowledged a growing distinction between two categories of twin studies: those aimed at assessing genetic contributions to disease and those aimed at assessing environmental contributions while controlling for genetic variation. They concluded with a brief section on recently founded twin registries that had begun to provide unprecedented access to twins for medical research. Here we offer an overview of the twin research that, in our estimation, best represents the field has progress since 1984. We start by summarizing what we know about twinning. We then focus on the value of twin study designs to differentiate between genetic and environmental influences on health and on emerging applications of twins in multiple areas of medical research. We finish by describing how twin registries and networks are accelerating twin research worldwide.",

The focus is on Dorothy Burlingham's (1952; Twins: A study of three sets of identical twins with 30 charts. London, UK: Imago) classic, in-depth study of three identical twin-pairs. Implications for how twins are raised currently will be examined. Reviews are presented of twin research concerning monozygotic twins with maturity-onset diabetes, gene editing of fetal Chinese twins, educational disadvantage of early-born twins, and developmental trajectories of twins' prenatal movements. Some unusual experiences and situations involving twins that warrant media attention are also summarized. They include twins with nearly identical license plates, a rare case of fetus-in-fetu, twin brothers killed at Pearl Harbor, the death of a 96-year-old twin Holocaust survivor, the accidental death of male-female twin toddlers in a heated car and confusion over identical twin politicians.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by pathogenic variants in the NF2 gene. The pathogenic variant is either inherited or obtained by de novo mutation, characterised by the presence of schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas. Here we report the presence of NF2 in one twin, with bilateral vestibular schwannomas and a pathogenic variant of the NF2 gene identified in both tumour and lymphocytes, while his monozygous brother remains asymptomatic. Imaging of the unaffected twin showed no tumour load and genetic testing via Sanger sequencing and Amplification Refractory Mutation System assay demonstrated low levels of expression of the NF2 variant in lymphocytes. Further testing on non-haemopoietic tissue showed little expression or absence of the pathogenic variant. Given there is no family history and the low level of the variant, we assume the pathogenic variant is a de novo mutation during embryogenesis. De novo mutations have been described as occurring at three possible time points in the creation of monozygous twins with different genetic make-up; prior to the twinning event, as a cause of the event, or after the twinning event. Of these options, we hypothesise that the discordance in the expression of the NF2 variant between these twins is likely due to a mutational event that occurred as a result of either of the latter two possibilities, between which we cannot determine. The pathogenic variant in lymphocytes was likely transferred between the twins through a shared blood supply in utero, and the non-haemopoietic samples that showed low levels of expression, were likely due to the presence of lymphocytic cells. Therefore, we have a discordance between monozygous twins at the NF2 gene.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) may provide additional information for prenatal assessment of twins. It may improve the diagnostic confidence of dating, nuchal translucency (NT) and chorionicity assignment in twin pregnancies. The \"virtual 3DUS placentoscopy\" can guide selective fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (SFLP) to treat twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Volumetric assessment of the dysmorphic acardiac twin with the Virtual Organ Computer-aided Analysis (VOCAL) software is more accurate than the conventional ultrasound measurement. Twin anemia polycythemia (TAP) sequence and selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) may be clinically monitored with 3DUS placental volume (PV) and power Doppler vascular indices. Congenital anomalies are more common in twins. Evaluation of fetal anomalies with 3DUS could assist perinatal management. The 3DUS power Doppler can provide a better understanding of true and false umbilical cord knots, which are commonly found in monoamniotic (MA) twins. Single demise in monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies can cause severe neurologic morbidity in the surviving co-twin. Prenatal prediction of brain injury in the surviving co-twin with unremarkable neurosonographic examination is difficult. The 3DUS power Doppler may aid in prenatal detection of subtle abnormal cerebral perfusion. Prenatal assessment of conjoined twins with 3DUS is important if emergency postnatal surgical separation is anticipated. There is no significant additional advantage in using real-time 3DUS to guide prenatal interventions. Assessment of the cervix and pelvic floor during twin pregnancies is enhanced with 3DUS. Due to lack of high-quality studies, routine prenatal 3DUS in twin pregnancies needs to be balanced with risks of excessive ultrasound exposure.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular anomalies are more common in monochorionic twins, especially with twin-twin transfusion, compared to other twin types and to singletons. Because previous studies are based on fetal and neonatal echocardiography, more information is needed to study prevalence of cardiac anomalies in twin miscarriages, stillbirths, and children after the immediate neonatal period.\nWith specific attention to cardiac anomalies, we reviewed the medical records of 335 selected liveborn twin pairs from the Marshfield Clinic Twin Cohort (enriched for twin-twin transfusion) and all twins (175 pairs) identified in the Wisconsin Stillbirth Service Program cohort of late miscarriages and stillbirths.\nStructural cardiac defects occurred in 12% of liveborn monochorionic twin infants and 7.5% of stillborn infants with twin-twin transfusion compared to only 2% of liveborn dizygotic twins and no stillborn dizygotic infants. The most common cardiac lesion in liveborn twins was ventricular septal defect, which was usually isolated and discordant, preferentially affecting the smaller twin in monochorionic pairs. Among stillborn and miscarried monochorionic twins, the most common cardiac lesion was acardia.\nMonochorionic twins, particularly those with TTT, are at increased risk for a spectrum of structural cardiac malformations which we suggest may be related to asymmetry of the inner cell mass resulting in a smaller poorly perfused twin. In severe cases, limited cardiac and circulatory development in the affected twin leads to acardia. In less severe cases, the smaller infant has deficient septal growth that sometimes results in ventricular septal defect.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies are one of the main tools for studying the interaction between genes and the environment in the development of complex diseases such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The Isfahan Twin Registry (ITR) was launched in Isfahan in 2017 as a pilot study to establish a nationwide twin registry in Iran and aims to obtain comprehensive information about complex diseases and their risk factors from twins and multiples living in Isfahan. ITR will continue to recruit twins and multiples until all twins residing in Isfahan are registered in the registry. Twins are identified from welfare agencies, public health homes, maternity hospitals, Persian Twins Association and the local media. Demographic information, twin similarities, lifestyle, family history of diseases and past medical history are collected using validated questionnaires. Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure are measured by health professionals. Hematology panel, fasting blood sugar, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and quantitative C-reactive protein are measured by an automated analyzer. Extra samples are obtained for future studies. For twins aged under 6 years, parents complete the questionnaires for their children and a brief questionnaire for themselves. Currently, 998 persons (395 pairs and 67 multiples) are registered in the ITR and have provided their data. Results of preliminary data analysis are discussed in this article. We plan to carry out longitudinal assessments. ITR can play an important role in future epigenetic, biomarkers and omics studies using the biobank materials.",

    "abstract": "To explore the influence of frozen embryo transfer (FET) and fresh embryo transfer (Fresh) on the birthweight of live-born twins.\nA total of 8482 live-born twins were studied.

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare congenital abnormality with an estimated incidence of 1:50,000 pregnancies and 1:200,000 live births. Pygopagus twins are characterized by sacrococcygeal fusion that is commonly associated with perineal and spinal abnormalities. Management of this complex disease requires a well-developed surgical system with multidisciplinary capacity and expertise.A decade ago there were no dedicated pediatric neurosurgeons in southern Vietnam. This has changed within a few short years; there are now 10 dedicated pediatric neurosurgeons with continually expanding technical capacity. In August 2017 a multidisciplinary surgical and anesthetic team successfully separated female pygopagus twins with fused sacrum and spinal cord with associated myelomeningocele defect.The authors present here the first successful separation of pygopagus twins in Vietnam as a representative case of gradual and sustainable pediatric neurosurgical scale-up.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancy has a high risk for developing uterine atony (UA). This study aimed to evaluate efficacy and clinical outcomes of prophylactic compression sutures to treat UA during twin cesarean section (CS).\nAll patient records of twin deliveries by CS after gestational age of 24\u2009weeks in a large maternity hospital in South Korea between January 2013 and June 2018 were reviewed. Patients with monochorionic monoamniotic twins were excluded from data analysis. In total, 953 women were eligible for data analysis.\nOf the 953 patients, compression sutures were applied to 147 cases with postpartum bleeding that were refractory to uterine massage and uterotonics. Out of the 147, two patients (1.4%) proceeded to additional uterine artery ligation to achieve hemostasis, yielding a success rate of 98.6%. The rate of transfusion after the first 24\u2009h of delivery in the suture group was not significantly different from that in the non-suture group, suggesting that both groups achieved hemostasis at an equal rate after the first 24\u2009h of delivery. The difference in the operation time between the two groups was only 8.5\u2009min. The rate of subsequent pregnancy among the patients who received compression sutures was 44.4%.\nOverall, our findings suggest that with early and fast implementation of compression sutures, UA can be treated in the setting of twin cesarean delivery without significantly increasing maternal morbidity.",

Out of the 147, two patients (1.4%) proceeded to additional uterine artery ligation to achieve hemostasis, yielding a success rate of 98.6%. The rate of transfusion after the first 24\u2009h of delivery in the suture group was not significantly different from that in the non-suture group, suggesting that both groups achieved hemostasis at an equal rate after the first 24\u2009h of delivery. The difference in the operation time between the two groups was only 8.5\u2009min. The rate of subsequent pregnancy among the patients who received compression sutures was 44.4%.",

    "abstract": "Many adult drinkers consume far beyond the binge threshold. This \"high-intensity drinking\" (HID), defined as 2 (HID-2) and 3 (HID-3) times the binge threshold, is of public health interest due to its role in acute alcohol-related harms. Research on HID has mostly been limited to college-aged young adults, focused on contextual factors, and neglected the potential role of genetic influences on the propensity to engage in HID.\nStructured diagnostic interviews assessing past-year alcohol involvement were conducted with 3,785 individuals (1,365 men, 2,420 women; M\nAmong past-year drinkers, the prevalence of HID-2 and HID-3 was both 22%, with men disproportionally represented. The frequencies of drinking, intoxication, and binge drinking significantly increased across the heavier drinking categories, which also evidenced higher average consumption quantities and higher rates of alcohol-related consequences. The propensity to engage in HID was significantly heritable (A\u00a0=\u00a037% [95% CI: 28 to 46%]), with individual-specific environmental influences accounting for the remainder of the variance.\nThis study convincingly demonstrates that HID is not restricted to college-aged young adults, but also can be highly prevalent among those of working age, and that the propensity to engage in HID is partially explained by genetic influences.",

    "abstract": "Parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) causes serious morbidity in the neonatal intensive care unit. Infection with gut-associated bacteria is associated with cholestasis, but the role of intestinal microbiota in PNAC is poorly understood. We examined the composition of stool microbiota from premature twins discordant for PNAC as a strategy to reduce confounding from variables associated with both microbiota and cholestasis. Eighty-four serial stool samples were included from 4 twin sets discordant for PNAC. Random Forests was utilized to determine genera most discriminatory in classifying samples from infants with and without PNAC. In infants with PNAC, we detected a significant increase in the relative abundance of Klebsiella, Veillonella, Enterobacter, and Enterococcus (P\u200a<\u200a0.05). Bray-Curtis dissimilarities in infants with PNAC were significantly different (P\u200a<\u200a0.05) from infants without PNAC. Our findings warrant further exploration in larger cohorts and experimental models of PNAC to determine if a microbiota signature predicts PNAC, as a basis for future interventions to mitigate liver injury.",

    "abstract": "Studying the early dynamic development of cortical folding with remarkable individual variability is critical for understanding normal early brain development and related neurodevelopmental disorders. This study focuses on the fingerprinting capability and the individual variability of cortical folding during early brain development. Specifically, we aim to explore (a) whether the developing neonatal cortical folding is unique enough to be considered as a \"fingerprint\" that can reliably identify an individual within a cohort of infants; (b) which cortical regions manifest more individual variability and thus contribute more for infant identification; (c) whether the infant twins can be distinguished by cortical folding. Hence, for the first time, we conduct infant individual identification and individual variability analysis involving twins based on the developing cortical folding features (mean curvature, average convexity, and sulcal depth) in 472 neonates with 1,141 longitudinal MRI scans. Experimental results show that the infant individual identification achieves 100% accuracy when using the neonatal cortical folding features to predict the identities of 1- and 2-year-olds. Besides, we observe high identification capability in the high-order association cortices (i.e., prefrontal, lateral temporal, and inferior parietal regions) and two unimodal cortices (i.e., precentral gyrus and lateral occipital cortex), which largely overlap with the regions encoding remarkable individual variability in cortical folding during the first 2\u2009years. For twins study, we show that even for monozygotic twins with identical genes and similar developmental environments, their cortical folding features are unique enough for accurate individual identification; and in some high-order association cortices, the differences between monozygotic twin pairs are significantly lower than those between dizygotic twins. This study thus provides important insights into individual identification and individual variability based on cortical folding during infancy.",

    "abstract": "To assess the value of using computerized cardiotocography (cCTG) short-term variation (STV) for intrapartum monitoring in monochorionic twins (MC) complicated by selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR).\nAll available cCTGs retrieved from computerized medical records of MC with sIUGR were retrospectively studied regarding the behavior of the STV. sIUGR was defined as intertwin estimated fetal weight (EFW) discordance of \u226520% with the abdominal circumference (AC) below the fifth percentile and/or the EFW of the smaller twin below the 10th percentile. The sIUGR classification system proposed by Gratacos et\u00a0al. was used using types I-III on the basis of umbilical artery Doppler characteristics of the IUGR twin. The admission (entry) STV and final pre-delivery (last) STV values were analyzed. Cases with intrauterine demise, with structural or chromosomal abnormalities, with twin anemia polycythemia sequence (TAPS) and/or twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) were excluded.\nDuring the study period, 64 consecutive cases were managed within our department. Thirty-two cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria for analysis. Mean gestational age at assessment and at delivery was 28.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7 and 31.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2\u2009weeks, respectively.

    "abstract": "Pregnancy is associated with increased coarctation-associated complications. We report the successful management of emergency lower-segment cesarean delivery in a patient with coarctation of aorta. A parturient at 34 weeks of gestation of a twin pregnancy with uncorrected coarctation of aorta was taken for emergency lower-segment cesarean delivery to be performed using epidural anesthesia. A mixture of lignocaine (lidocaine), bupivacaine, and fentanyl was administered epidurally. In view of unsatisfactory motor action, general anesthesia had to be administered. However, because of sufficient analgesia due to the epidural drugs, optimal hemodynamic control was achieved. A combination of general and epidural anesthesia minimizes adverse effects of coarctation of aorta, with improved maternal and fetal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) decode user's intentions to control external devices. However, performance variations across individuals have limited their use to laboratory environments. Handedness could contribute to these variations, especially when motor imagery (MI) tasks are used for BCI control. To further understand how handedness affects BCI control, performance differences between two monozygotic twins were analysed during offline movement and MI tasks, and while twins controlled a BCI using right-hand MI. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), brain structures' volumes, and neuropsychological tests were assessed to evaluate physiological, anatomical and psychological relationships with BCI performance. Results showed that both twins had good motor imagery and attention abilities, similar volumes on most subcortical brain structures, more pronounced event-related desynchronization elicited by the twin performing non-dominant MI, and that this twin also obtained significant higher performances with the BCI. Linear regression analysis implied a strong association between twins' BCI performance, and more pronounced cortical activations in the contralateral hemisphere relative to hand MI. Therefore, it is possible that BCI performance was related with the ability of each twin to elicit cortical activations during hand MI, and less associated with subcortical brain structures' volumes and neuropsychological tests.",

    "abstract": "To compare the outcome of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies conceived by in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) with that of spontaneously conceived MCDA twins.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of MCDA twin pregnancies conceived after IVF/ICSI or spontaneously, followed from the first trimester onwards at a single center between January 2002 and September 2018. The primary outcome was survival per fetus from the first trimester until 28\u2009days after birth. Secondary outcome measures were number of survivors, miscarriage, termination of pregnancy, intrauterine and neonatal death, major congenital anomalies, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, selective fetal growth restriction, gestational age at birth, delivery before 32\u2009weeks' gestation, mode of delivery, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, birth weight and birth-weight discordance.\nOf the 654 MCDA pregnancies included in the analysis, 80 were conceived by IVF/ICSI and 574 spontaneously. Overall fetal and neonatal survival was significantly lower in the IVF/ICSI group than in the spontaneous-conception group (79% vs 90%; P\u2009=\u20090.001). In the IVF/ICSI group, compared with the spontaneous-conception group, loss of one or both twins occurred twice as often (29% vs 14%; P\u2009=\u20090.001) and there was a higher risk of second-trimester miscarriage (8% vs 1%; P\u2009=\u20090.002).\nMCDA twins conceived after IVF/ICSI have lower overall survival rates and higher rates of second-trimester miscarriage than do spontaneously conceived MCDA twins.

    "abstract": "Bilateral Acute Depigmentation of the Iris (BADI) is a condition which was first described in a case series from Turkey by Tugal-Tutkin and Urgancioglu in (Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol 244:742-6, 2006). The condition is characterized by bilateral acute depigmentation and discoloration of the iris stroma, pigment dispersion, and deposition of pigment in the angle. In our case we report a patient who developed BADI after receiving pitcher plant extract injections for chronic migraine, while her identical twin sister has normal iris architecture and pigmentation and never received any pitcher plant injections.\nPatient is a 41-year-old female with history of pitcher plant extract injections to her face for chronic migraine, who later developed bilateral depigmentation of the iris. She did not have any signs of anterior segment uveitis or iridocyclitis. She has an identical twin sister who maintained normal iris pigmentation during the entire course.\nBilateral Acute depigmentation of the is a recently discovered condition described in the literature in Turkish patients (Tugal-Tutkun and Urgancioglu, Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol 244:742-6, 2006; Tugal-Tutkun et al., Ophthalmology 116(8):1552-7, 2009). This condition affects mainly young females and is characterized by acute bilateral stromal depigmentation, without other pathologic ocular findings. These patients usually maintain normal vision and do not develop significant glaucoma from pigment collecting in the anterior chamber angle. This condition can be mistaken for Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis, pigment dispersion syndrome, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, and viral iridocyclitis. This is the first reported case in North America and is important for differentiation from the above pathologies. Our patient had a history of pitcher plant extract injections to the face but it is unclear if this is associated with our patient's development of BADI. As awareness of this condition progresses, a possible etiology may be elucidated.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory models derived from clinical samples represent a solid platform in preclinical research for drug testing and investigation of disease mechanisms. The integration of these laboratory models with their digital counterparts (i.e., predictive mathematical models) allows to set up digital twins essential to fully exploit their potential to face the enormous molecular complexity of human organisms. In particular, due to the close integration of cell metabolism with all other cellular processes, any perturbation in cellular physiology typically reflect on altered cells metabolic profiling. In this regard, changes in metabolism have been shown, also in our laboratory, to drive a causal role in the emergence of cancer disease. Nevertheless, a unique metabolic program does not describe the altered metabolic profile of all tumour cells due to many causes from genetic variability to intratumour heterogeneous dependency on nutrients consumption and metabolism by multiple co-existing subclones. Currently, fluxomics approaches just match with the necessity of characterizing the overall flux distribution of cells within given samples, by disregarding possible heterogeneous behaviors. For the purpose of stratifying cancer heterogeneous subpopulations, quantification of fluxes at the single-cell level is needed. To this aim, we here present a new computational framework called single-cell Flux Balance Analysis (scFBA) that aims to set up digital metabolic twins in the perspective of being better exploited within a framework that makes also use of laboratory patient cell models. In particular, scFBA aims at integrating single-cell RNA-seq data within computational population models in order to depict a snapshot of the corresponding single-cell metabolic phenotypes at a given moment, together with an unsupervised identification of metabolic subpopulations.",

    "abstract": "To establish the changes in perinatal morbidity and mortality in twin pregnancies in Finland, a retrospective register research was conducted. Our extensive data from a 28-year study period provide important information on the outcome of twin pregnancies in Finland that has previously not been reported to this extent.\nAll 23,498 twin pregnancies with 46,996 children born in Finland during 1987-2014 were included in the study. Data were gathered from the Medical Birth Register and the Hospital Discharge Register (Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Finland) regarding perinatal mortality (PNM) and morbidity. For statistical analysis, binomial regression analysis and crosstabs were performed. The results are expressed in means, percentages and ranges with comparison to singletons when appropriate. Odds ratios from binomial regression analysis are reported. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThere were 46,363 liveborn and 633 stillborn twins in Finland during 1987-2014. Perinatal mortality decreased markedly, from 45.1 to 6.5 per 1000 for twin A and from 54.1 to 11.9 per 1000 for twin B during the study period. Yet, the PNM difference between twin A and B remained. Early neonatal mortality did not differ between twins, but has decreased in both. Asphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome, need for antibiotics and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) stay were markedly more common in twin B.\nIn Finland, PNM and early neonatal mortality in twins decreased significantly during 1987-2014 and are nowadays very low. However, twin B still faces more complications. The outline provided may be used to further improve the monitoring and thus perinatal outcome of twins, especially twin B.",

    "abstract": "Seventeen-day-old twins were hospitalized for neonatal herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) with central nervous system disease and internal capsule and thalamic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They were treated with the usual intravenous (IV) treatment and oral therapy for 6 months. The clinical course was good in both children with negative HSV polymerase chain reaction on completion of IV therapy. The neurological condition recurred in one child with new radiological lesions at 7 months of age, 2 weeks after discontinuation of oral treatment. Cerebral lesions highlighted on the MRI scan are specific to the neonatal period and impact long-term prognosis. The likely genetic predisposition in this case is interesting and requires further investigation. In addition, this case raises questions about the duration of oral acyclovir suppressive therapy.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to measure the DNA methylation state of thousands of CpG islands in the blood of two monozygotic twins that were discordant for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Twin 1 had suffered myocardial infarction, while the other was healthy.\nSince the aim of this study was to identify differentially methylated regions which might act as potential markers, reduced-representation bisulfite libraries were used for whole-genome methylation analysis.\nAccording to the analysis, 11 genes lipid droplet associated hydrolase (LDAH), apolipoprotein B (APOB), acyl-CoA synthetase medium chain family member 2A (ACSM2A), acyl-CoA synthetase medium chain family member 5(ACSM5), acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3 (ACSF3), carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), carboxylesterase 1 pseudogene 1 (CES1P1), AFG3 like matrix AAA peptidase subunit 2 (AFG3L2), iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme (ISCU), SEC14 like lipid binding 2 (SEC14L2) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) were all hypomethylated in DNA from twin 2, the unaffected twin. Methylation changes were observed at different multiple loci between the twins, suggesting loci that are affected by disease status in identical genetic backgrounds.\nThis twin study may contribute significantly to the understanding of the genetic basis of CVD and resulting myocardial infarction. This approach may allow identification of possible target loci associated with aberrant epigenetic regulation in CVD.",

    "abstract": "The T cell repertoire in each individual includes T cell receptors (TCRs) of enormous sequence diversity through the pairing of diverse TCR \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains, each generated by somatic recombination of paralogous gene segments. Whether the TCR repertoire contributes to susceptibility to infectious or autoimmune diseases in concert with disease-associated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) polymorphisms is unknown. Due to a lack in high-throughput technologies to sequence TCR \u03b1-\u03b2 pairs, current studies on whether the TCR repertoire is shaped by host genetics have so far relied only on single-chain analysis. Using a high-throughput single T cell sequencing technology, we obtained the largest paired TCR\u03b1\u03b2 dataset so far, comprising 965,523 clonotypes from 15 healthy individuals including 6 monozygotic twin pairs. Public TCR \u03b1- and, to a lesser extent, TCR \u03b2-chain sequences were common in all individuals. In contrast, sharing of entirely identical TCR\u03b1\u03b2 amino acid sequences was very infrequent in unrelated individuals, but highly increased in twins, in particular in CD4 memory T cells. Based on nucleotide sequence identity, a subset of these shared clonotypes appeared to be the progeny of T cells that had been generated during fetal development and had persisted for more than 50 y. Additional shared TCR\u03b1\u03b2 in twins were encoded by different nucleotide sequences, implying that genetic determinants impose structural constraints on thymic selection that favor the selection of TCR \u03b1-\u03b2 pairs with entire sequence identities.",

    "abstract": "We estimated the incidence of CH in twins, analyse the clinical features of CH cases in twins and further evaluate the CH screening strategy and recall procedures for twins.\nA retrospective investigation of the screening results and confirmed cases in 724,791 newborns was conducted from 2015 to 2017 in Guangzhou. Clinical features were compared between twins with CH and singletons with CH. In addition, the twins were further divided into same-sex twins and different-sex twins to analyse the characteristics and incidence of CH and to compare differences in the confirmed cases in the 2 groups.\nThe incidence of CH in same-sex twins was 1/593, which was much higher than the incidence of CH in singletons (1/1323) and different-sex twins (1/3060). Of the 20 twins diagnosed with CH, 17 were same-sex twins and 3 were different-sex twins. Among the six pairs of same-sex twins with CH, four had TSH inconsistency, which reached 67%. Eight of the 17 cases of same-sex twins diagnosed with CH had negative results at the first screening.\nDistinguishing same-sex twins from different-sex twins during newborn screening is more feasible. The incidence of CH in same-sex twins is much higher than that in the general population and the risk of transient CH is relatively high. In positive cases in same-sex twins, the simultaneous recall of the twin can effectively avoid a missed diagnosis. The screening center should properly evaluate the recall strategy and screening procedure for twins, especially twins of the same-sex.",

The relationships of adverse outcomes in two groups were analyzed.\nA total of 109 MCDA twin pairs were examined; 15 cases were classified into the abnormal CI group and 94 cases into the normal CI group. The incidence of TTTS was significantly higher in the abnormal than in the normal CI group (26.7% vs 7.45%, P = .04).

Possible correlation among other attributes such as breastfeeding, socioeconomic status, oral habits, frequency of brushing, and sweet intake were also assessed.\nA sample of 40 monozygotic children between the age group of 6 and 12 was selected. The parents were asked to complete the questionnaire and report with their children. Then dental examinations were carried out and the prevalence of dental caries among the twins were assessed.\nAmong the total samples, 61.5% exhibited caries. Lower birth weight twins showed an increased chance of caries (72.22%), compared to higher birth weight twins (68.18%). Second of the twins had an increased risk of dental caries (70%) compared to the first (60%). 90% of the male twins and 45% of the female twins had caries. The association between dental caries and other variables were also assessed; those who were exclusively breastfed had an increased risk (70%) of caries. Evaluation of socioeconomic status and caries revealed a risk of for the high (65%), middle (62.5%), and lower groups (58.33%). Children without oral habits showed a higher prevalence (73.3%) of caries when compared to those without any habits (50%). It was noticed that the brushing frequency is not related to the severity of caries. The strongest association was noticed between excessive sweet liking and prevalence of dental caries.\nThe study revealed difference in caries prevalence among monozygotic twins in relation to birth weight, birth order, and gender.

    "results": "Among the total samples, 61.5% exhibited caries. Lower birth weight twins showed an increased chance of caries (72.22%), compared to higher birth weight twins (68.18%). Second of the twins had an increased risk of dental caries (70%) compared to the first (60%). 90% of the male twins and 45% of the female twins had caries. The association between dental caries and other variables were also assessed; those who were exclusively breastfed had an increased risk (70%) of caries. Evaluation of socioeconomic status and caries revealed a risk of for the high (65%), middle (62.5%), and lower groups (58.33%). Children without oral habits showed a higher prevalence (73.3%) of caries when compared to those without any habits (50%). It was noticed that the brushing frequency is not related to the severity of caries. The strongest association was noticed between excessive sweet liking and prevalence of dental caries.",

    "abstract": "Intussusception, a common cause of intestinal obstruction in children, typically requires medical reduction. Here, we describe the case of a pair of twins who had simultaneous intussusception and were positive for fecal adenovirus-strongly indicating that adenovirus infection may be a main cause of the intussusception.\nTwo 1-year-old twin girls were brought to Cathay General Hospital one after another on the same day. Both presented with intermittent abdominal pain, abdominal distension, diarrhea, and loss of appetite.\nTheir laboratory data were adenovirus positivity in rectal swab culture. Intussusception was diagnosed through a lower gastrointestinal series.\nThe twins were treated with reduction for intussusception.\nBoth patients recovered well, without recurrence.\nMost cases of intussusception are idiopathic. However, some potential risk factors-as strongly suggested by the current cases-are genetic factors and adenovirus infection.",

    "abstract": "Despite being developed from one zygote, heterokaryotypic monozygotic (MZ) co-twins exhibit discordant karyotypes. Epigenomic studies in biological samples from heterokaryotypic MZ co-twins are of the most significant value for assessing the effects on gene- and allele-specific expression of an extranumerary chromosomal copy or structural chromosomal disparities in otherwise nearly identical germline genetic contributions. Here, we use RNA-Seq data from existing repositories to establish within-pair correlations for the breadth and magnitude of allele-specific expression (ASE) in heterokaryotypic MZ co-twins discordant for trisomy 21 and maternal 21q inheritance, as well as homokaryotypic co-twins. We show that there is a genome-wide disparity at ASE sites between the heterokaryotypic MZ co-twins. Although most of the disparity corresponds to changes in the magnitude of biallelic imbalance, ASE sites switching from either strictly monoallelic to biallelic imbalance or the reverse occur in few genes that are known or predicted to be imprinted, subject to X-chromosome inactivation or A-to-I(G) RNA edited. We also uncovered comparable ASE differences between homokaryotypic MZ twins. The extent of ASE discordance in MZ twins (2.7%) was about 10-fold lower than the expected between pairs of unrelated, non-twin males or females. The results indicate that the observed within-pair dissimilarities in breadth and magnitude of ASE sites in the heterokaryotypic MZ co-twins could not solely be attributable to the aneuploidy and the missing allelic heritability at 21q.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that many psychiatric disorders etiologically represent the extreme end of dimensionally distributed features rather than distinct entities. The extent to which this applies to eating disorders (EDs) is unknown.\nWe investigated if there is similar etiology in (a) the continuous distribution of the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2), (b) the extremes of EDI-2 score, and (c) registered ED diagnoses, in 1481 female twin pairs at age 18 years (born 1992-1999). EDI-2 scores were self-reported at age 18. ED diagnoses were identified through the Swedish National Patient Register, parent-reported treatment and/or self-reported purging behavior of a frequency and duration consistent with DSM-IV criteria. We differentiated between anorexia nervosa (AN) and other EDs.\nThe heritability of the EDI-2 score was 0.65 (95% CI 0.61-0.68). The group heritabilities in DeFries-Fulker extremes analyses were consistent over different percentile-based extreme groups [0.59 (95% CI 0.37-0.81) to 0.65 (95% CI 0.55-0.75)]. Similarly, the heritabilities in liability threshold models were consistent over different levels of severity. In joint categorical-continuous models, the twin-based genetic correlation was 0.52 (95% CI 0.39-0.65) between EDI-2 score and diagnoses of other EDs, and 0.26 (95% CI 0.08-0.42) between EDI-2 score and diagnoses of AN. The non-shared environmental correlations were 0.52 (95% CI 0.32-0.70) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.38-0.79), respectively.\nOur findings suggest that some EDs can partly be conceptualized as the extreme manifestation of continuously distributed ED features. AN, however, might be more distinctly genetically demarcated from ED features in the general population than other EDs.",

    "abstract": "The INO80 family of chromatin remodellers are multisubunit complexes that perform a variety of tasks on nucleosomes. Family members are built around a heterohexamer of RuvB-like protein, an ATP-dependent DNA translocase,nuclear actin and actin-related proteins, and a few complex-specific subunits. They modify chromatin in a number of ways including nucleosome sliding and exchange of variant histones. Recent structural information on INO80 and SWR1 complexes has revealed similarities in the basic architecture of the complexes. However, structural and biochemical data on the complexes bound to nucleosomes reveal these similarities to be somewhat superficial and their biochemical activities and mechanisms are very different. Consequently, the INO80 family displays a surprising diversity of function that is based upon a similar structural framework.",

    "abstract": "It is well-established that the prenatal period is a critical and sensitive period of an individual's life, linking prenatal circumstances to short- and long-term outcomes such as infant mortality, educational and occupational success. However, little is known about how prenatal nurture affects intermediate outcomes and noncognitive characteristics such as behavior and behavioral problems. In this paper, I investigate the effects of birth weight on behavioral problems at age 12. I comprehensively control for confounders related to family background and genetics by employing a research design exploiting differences among Danish monozygotic twins. I find that birth weight has a statistically significant negative effect on behavioral problems measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and that birth weight affects boys and girls differently: birth weight is significantly negatively associated with emotional problems among girls and hyperactivity among boys.",

    "abstract": "Twins are considered to be at an increased risk for perinatal mortality and morbidities, but it is unclear whether preterm twins are at an increased risk for poor developmental outcomes when compared to preterm singletons. Our aim was to compare the neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm twins vs singletons at 5 years of age.\nVery low birth weight and very low gestational age infants (twins n\u2009=\u200966, singletons n\u2009=\u2009157) were recruited as a part of the PIPARI project in the Turku University Hospital, covering a regional population. Cognitive development, neuropsychological performance, and neurodevelopmental impairments (including cerebral palsy, hearing deficit, visual impairment, and intellectual disability) were evaluated at 5 years of age.\nTwins and singletons had otherwise similar perinatal background factors, except for the higher proportion of preterm rupture of membranes in singletons. Twins had cognitive and neuropsychological outcomes that were otherwise comparable with singletons, but they had a slightly lower verbal intelligence quotient (estimate -5.81, 95% CI -11.14 to -0.48, p\u2009=\u20090.03). Being a twin was not a risk for neurodevelopmental impairments.\nOur study shows that, contrary to a common hypothesis, the overall neurodevelopment of very preterm twins does not significantly differ from that of preterm singletons.",

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal diagnoses (MSD) are one of the largest diagnostic groups for disability pensions (DP). This study investigated the associations between life events and DP due to MSD, considering sociodemographic, health, and familial factors.\nThe study sample included 18,530 Finnish twins, 24-64\u00a0years old at baseline, who responded to a questionnaire in 1981 including a 21-item life event inventory. Information on DP with diagnosis codes (ICD codes: M00-M99) were obtained from the official national pension registers. Life events were divided into family- and work-related events. \"Positive change in life\" was analyzed separately. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nDuring the follow-up of 23\u00a0years, 1273 (7%) individuals were granted DP due to MSD. In discordant pair analysis, family-related events (\u2265\u20094 events) increased (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.31, 2.03) and the absence of such events decreased (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48, 0.95) the risk of DP due to MSD. For work-related events (\u2265\u20093 events), the risk estimates were non-significant when controlling for familial factors. Having had a positive change in life decreased the risk of DP due to MSD (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65, 0.96) while controlling for familial confounding, but were non-significant in the full model controlling for various covariates (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75, 1.12).\nThe associations between life events and the risk of DP due to MSD are complex and potentially affected by familial and other confounding factors including sociodemographics and health.",

Musculoskeletal abnormalities like vertebral anomalies, sacral agenesis, foot deformities and hip dysplasia have been described in literature. We describe two cases of pyopagus twins with congenital talipes equinovarus and congenital vertical talus deformity which have not been described previously in this type of conjoined twins. The orthopaedist should look actively for such deformities in this patient population and be wary of the difficulties associated with their management.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins provide a unique opportunity to better understand complex genetic diseases and the relative contribution of heritable factors in shaping the immune system throughout life. Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorders (CVID) are primary antibody defects displaying wide phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, with monogenic transmission accounting for only a minority of the cases. Here, we report a pair of monozygotic twins concordant for CVID without a family history of primary immunodeficiency. They featured a remarkably similar profile of clinical manifestations and immunological alterations at diagnosis (established at age 37) and along the subsequent 15 years of follow-up. Interestingly, whole-exome sequencing failed to identify a monogenic cause for CVID, but unraveled a combination of heterozygous variants, with a predicted deleterious impact. These variants were found in genes involved in relevant immunological pathways, such as ",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. In most cases, the development of the disease is sporadic and is not associated with any currently known mutations associated with PD. It is believed that changes associated with the epigenetic regulation of gene expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. The study of individuals with an almost identical genetic background, such as monozygotic twins, is one of the best approaches to the analysis of such changes. A whole-transcriptome analysis of dermal fibroblasts obtained from three pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for PD was carried out in this work. Twenty-nine differentially expressed genes were identified in the three pairs of twins. These genes were included in seven processes within two clusters, according to the results of an enrichment analysis. The cluster with the greatest statistical significance included processes associated with the regulation of the differentiation of fat cells, the action potential, and the regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. The most significant genes, which occupied a central position in this cluster, were PTGS2, SCN9A, and GRIK2. These genes can be considered as potential candidate genes for PD.",

    "abstract": "The Louisville Twin Study (LTS) began in 1958 and became a premier longitudinal twin study of cognitive development. The LTS continuously collected data from twins through 2000 after which the study closed indefinitely due to lack of funding. Now that the majority of the sample is age 40 or older (61.36%, N\u2009=\u20091770), the LTS childhood data can be linked to midlife cognitive functioning, among other physical, biological, social, and psychiatric outcomes. We report results from two pilot studies in anticipation of beginning the midlife phase of the LTS. The first pilot study was a participant tracking study, in which we showed that approximately 90% of the Louisville families randomly sampled (N\u2009=\u2009203) for the study could be found. The second pilot study consisted of 40 in-person interviews in which twins completed cognitive, memory, biometric, and functional ability measures. The main purpose of the second study was to correlate midlife measures of cognitive functioning to a measure of biological age, which is an alternative index to chronological age that quantifies age as a function of the breakdown of structural and functional physiological systems, and then to relate both of these measures to twins' cognitive developmental trajectories. Midlife IQ was uncorrelated with biological age (-\u2009.01) while better scores on episodic memory more strongly correlated with lower biological age (-\u2009.19 to -\u2009.31). As expected, midlife IQ positively correlated with IQ measures collected throughout childhood and adolescence. Additionally, positive linear rates of change in FSIQ scores in childhood significantly correlated with biological age (-\u2009.68), physical functioning (.71), and functional ability (-\u2009.55), suggesting that cognitive development predicts lower biological age, better physical functioning, and better functional ability. In sum, the Louisville twins can be relocated to investigate whether and how early and midlife cognitive and physical health factors contribute to cognitive aging.",

    "abstract": "Recent pulmonary functional MRI findings of spatially and temporally persistent ventilation abnormalities in patients with asthma contrast with previous in\u00a0silico modeling studies that suggest that in asthma, ventilation defects may be randomly distributed. In a case study that used pulmonary MRI, CT imaging, and pulmonary function tests, we prospectively evaluated over the course of 7 years, nonidentical female adult twins, each with a lifelong history of asthma. We evaluated pulmonary function and MRI ventilation heterogeneity at baseline and follow-up after 7 years. In both twins, there was a spatially identical MRI ventilation defect and an abnormal subsegmental left-sided upper lobe airway that persisted in the same spatial location after 7 years. If ventilation defects are randomly distributed, this bears a probability of approximately one per 130,000 people. Our MRI observations in related patients with asthma suggest that ventilation abnormalities may not be randomly distributed in patients with asthma and persist distal to airway abnormalities for long periods of time.",

Our objective was to identify factors related to successful delayed delivery of the second twin, among cases in which the interval after delivery of the first twin was above 24h.\nA descriptive, retrospective and multicenter study of all delayed interval deliveries in dichorionic twins in 4 perinatal centers in Paris over a 14-year period.\nIn 13 cases of delayed interval delivery, delivery of twin 1 was at a median of 18 weeks' gestation (range 14WG+2days to 24WG), and none survived. Delivery of the second twin occurred at a median of 25 weeks' gestation +3 days, 51 days after twin 1 (range 13-138 days). Seven of the 13s twins (54 %) survived. There were 5 cases of chorioamnionitis and 1 case of maternal disseminated intravascular coagulation. Poor outcome was not significantly associated with the gestational age, presentation for PPROM or inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and white blood cell count) at the time of delivery of twin 1.\nDelayed-interval delivery of the second twin may prolong pregnancy and lead the second twin child to a viable term of birth; but carries a risk of maternal complications.",

    "abstract": "To construct monochorionic (MC) twin-specific longitudinal Doppler references for umbilical artery pulsatility index (UA-PI), middle cerebral artery (MCA) PI and peak systolic velocity (PSV) and ductus venosus (DV) PI derived from a strictly selected cohort of uncomplicated MC twins. The secondary aim of the study was to compare our findings with singleton reference charts.\nA retrospective evaluation was made of all consecutive uncomplicated MC twin pregnancies referred to our Unit from 2010 to 2018. Fortnightly serial examinations were performed of UA-PI, MCA-PI, MCA-PSV and DV-PI, according with the clinical protocol, from 20 to 37 weeks of gestation. We included cases with at least four ultrasound examinations, delivery at our hospital and complete neonatal follow up. A two-step method was used to trace the estimated centile curves: estimation of the median was performed with appropriate fractional polynomials by a multilevel model and estimation of the external centiles through the residuals (quantile regression). The comparison with singletons was made by plotting the references derived from the present study on the referred charts commonly used for singletons.\nThe study group comprised 150 uncomplicated MC twin pairs. Estimated centiles (3rd, 5th, 10th, 50th, 90th, 95th, 97th) of UA-PI, MCA-PI, MCA-PSV and DV-PI in function of the gestational age are presented. The comparison with singletons showed substantial differences, with higher UA-PI and lower MCA-PI and PSV median values in MC twins. Median DV PI values were similar to the values for singletons, while the upper centiles were higher in MC twins.\nThis study sets out MC twin-specific longitudinal references for UA-PI, MCA-PI, MCA-PSV and DV-PI derived from the largest series of uncomplicated MC twin pregnancies presently available. The comparison with singleton reference values underscores the deviation from physiology that is intrinsic to these unique pregnancies and supports the need for MC twin-specific charts.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally. Recent studies demonstrated that miRNAs are involved in the development of congenital heart defects (CHD). In this study, we aimed at identifying the specific patterns of miRNAs in blood of monozygotic twin pairs discordant for CHD and to assess whether miRNAs might be involved in the development or reflect the consequences of CHD.\nmiRNA microarray analysis and Real-Time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were employed to determine the miRNA abundance level from 12 monozygotic twins discordant for CHD and their non-CHD co-twins (n = 12). Enrichment analyses of altered miRNAs were performed using bioinformatics tools.\nCompared with non-CHD co-twins, profiling analysis indicated 34 miRNAs with a significant difference in abundance level (p<0.05, fold change \u2265 1.3), of which 11 miRNAs were up-regulated and 23 miRNAs were down-regulated. Seven miRNAs were validated with RT-qPCR including miR-511-3p, miR-1306-5p, miR-421, miR-4707-3p, miR-4732-3p, miR-5189-3p, and miR-890, and the results were consistent with microarray analysis. Five miRNAs namely miR-511-3p, miR-1306-5p, miR-4732-3p, miR-5189-3p, and miR-890 were found to be significantly up-regulated in twins < 10 years old. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the 7 validated miRNAs were involved in phosphatidylinositol signaling, gap junction signaling, and adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes.\nOur data show deregulated miRNA abundance levels in the peripheral blood of monozygotic twins discordant for CHD, and identify new candidates for further analysis, which may contribute to understanding the development of CHD in the future. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the target genes of these miRNAs are likely involved in signaling and communication of cardiomyocytes.",

    "abstract": "Given the increasing realization of the important functions of the gut microbial community in human health, it is important to determine whether the increased age of the host coupled with inevitable environmental changes can alter the stability of individual microbial strains of the gut microbial community. Since early studies demonstrated that pairs of twins possess the related gut microbial communities, to gain insights into the temporal stability of the reservoir of gut microbial strains in humans, we have assessed the strain relatedness of samples from two previously published data sets that were obtained from twin children and adults (36-80 years old) who have been either living together or apart for different times.\nWe analyzed the two data sets; twin children (n = 24) and adults (n = 50) using our previously developed strain-tracking program called Window-based Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) Similarity (WSS) that can distinguish a related strain pair from a non-related strain pair based on the overall genome-wide SNV similarity. To independently substantiate the identification of distinct microbial genomic variants (herein strains) observed from WSS analysis, we used analysis by StrainPhlAn.\nAnalysis of the twin children data set revealed a significantly (P-value <0.05) higher number of the shared strain pairs with a predominance of Bacteroides vulgatus between individual sets of twin pairs than the twin adult data set. Additional analysis on the adult twins showed that twins who have been living apart less than 10 years shared significantly more related strain pairs than twins living apart between 10 to 60 years. Eighty-year-old twins who had been living together for 79 years then separated for 1 year showed the highest number of related strain pairs consisting of B. vulgatus, Eubacterium eligens, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis. The next highest number of related strain pairs was found in 56-year-old twins who had been living together for 51 years then separated for 5 years (B. vulgatus and Coprococcus eutactus as related strains), 73-year-old twins living together for 66 years and then separated for 7 years (Bacteroides uniformis and Clostrium sp. L2-50 as related strains) and 36-year-old twins separated for 19 years (shared strains of Alistipes shahii and E. eligens). Finally, a sporadic appearance of a single shared strain that did not show a correlation with time of separation was observed in three twin sets that had separation times between 22 to 54 years.\nWe conclude from our strain-tracking analysis of twins that certain gut microbial strains can be shared between individuals in some cases for decades. Changes in the host environmental conditions over time can impact the stability landscape of the gut microbial community resulting in the appearance of new strains that could potentially impact microbe interactions that are essential for function in human health.",

Finally, a sporadic appearance of a single shared strain that did not show a correlation with time of separation was observed in three twin sets that had separation times between 22 to 54 years.",

    "abstract": "Genotype-phenotype discordance occurs occasionally in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Its causes are largely unknown. We describe a case of monochorionic, diamniotic twins with discordant clinical presentations of CAH, and show evidence for this being due to mosaicism resulting from a postzygotic full gene deletion of CYP21A2 prior to twinning.\nA 7-day-old 36-week gestation female infant (Twin A) presented to the emergency department with elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP). Her identical twin (Twin B) had normal 17-OHP on newborn screening. Both twins showed signs of virilization, more pronounced in Twin B. Molecular genetic testing of both twins and their parents showed a WT paternally-inherited CYP21A2 and a maternally-inherited copy containing the c.293-13C>G mutation. Both twins were also found to have a 5'-CYP21A1P/CYP21A2-3' hybrid (product of the common 30-kb deletion), derived from the deletion of the paternally-inherited CYP21A2. Neither mother nor father carried the deletion.\nThe genetic findings are consistent with mosaicism for two CYP21A2 cell lines in both twins. The first cell line is expected, based on parental results, while the second line is due to a postzygotic full gene deletion of the paternally-inherited WT CYP21A2. The resultant genotype, compound heterozygosity for c.293-13C>G and a CYP21A2 full gene deletion, is consistent with a salt-wasting CAH phenotype. Differential distribution of the second cell line between the twins is most likely the cause for their discrepant phenotypes. We believe this is the first report of somatic CYP21A2 mosaicism, and represents a novel cause for discrepant CAH phenotypes in monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "There is an important interplay between epigenetic factors and body weight, and previous work has identified ten sites where DNA methylation is robustly associated with body mass index (BMI) cross-sectionally. However, interpretation of the associations is complicated by the substantial changes in BMI often occurring in late-life, and the fact that methylation is often driven by genetic variation. This study therefore investigated the longitudinal association between these ten sites and BMI from midlife to late-life, and whether associations persist after controlling for genetic factors.\nWe used data from 535 individuals (mean age 68) in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA) with longitudinal measures of both DNA methylation from blood samples and BMI, spanning up to 20 years. Methylation levels were measured with the Infinium Human Methylation 450K or Infinium MethylationEpic array, with seven of the ten sites passing quality control. Latent growth curve models were applied to investigate longitudinal associations between methylation and BMI, and between-within models to study associations within twin pairs, thus adjusting for genetic factors.\nBaseline DNA methylation levels at five of the seven sites were associated with BMI level at age 65 (cg00574958 [CPT1A]; cg11024682 [SREBF1]), and/or change (cg06192883 [MYO5C]; cg06946797 [RMI2]; cg08857797 [VPS25]). For four of the five sites, the associations remained comparable within twin pairs. However, the effects of cg06192883 were substantially attenuated within pairs. No change in DNA methylation was detected for any of the seven evaluated sites.\nFive of the seven sites investigated were associated with late-life level and/or change in BMI. The effects for four of the sites remained similar when examined within twin pairs, indicating that the associations are mainly environmentally driven. However, the substantial attenuation in the association between cg06192883 and late-life BMI within pairs points to the importance of genetic factors in this association.",

    "abstract": "Subjective organization (SO) facilitates storage and retrieval of information but is often impaired following traumatic brain injury. No study has compared measures of SO using association rule analyses to clustering analyses. Moreover, there have been no studies investigating whether patients post-brain injury subjectively organize non-verbal information.\nThis study investigates the relationship between SO and recall of words and symbols with participants discordant for traumatic brain injury. Additionally, the authors explored the conditions under which clustering or association rule measures of SO were best used.\nTwo female monozygotic twins discordant for traumatic brain injury completed a multi-trial free recall test of words and symbols. The authors examined whether measures of SO derived from clustering analysis or association rule modeling could differentiate organizational abilities between participants' data.\nThe twin following sequential traumatic brain injuries demonstrated significantly less SO and recall relative to the twin without a traumatic brain injury. Both twins subjectively organized verbal and non-verbal information and each measure could differentiate the twins' performance.\nThe quantitative analysis of SO can provide clinicians with valuable information concerning a patient's recall performance.

    "abstract": "Elasmobranchs display various reproductive modes, which have been key to their evolutionary success. In recent decades there has been a rise in the number of reported cases of foetal abnormalities including fertilised, double-embryos held within one egg capsule, hereafter referred to as twins. Previously, the occurrences of twin egg cases have been reported in two batoid and one shark species. We report the first cases of twins in three species of oviparous elasmobranchs: the undulate ray (Raja undulata), the nursehound (Scyliorhinus stellaris), and the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). We investigated the genetic relationships between the twins in S. stellaris, and S. canicula using microsatellite markers. Whilst the S. stellaris twins displayed the same genotypes, we found that the S. canicula twin individuals arose through heteropaternal superfecundation. This is the first reported incidence of such a paternity in elasmobranchs. The relationship between environmental change and reproductive strategy in elasmobranchs is unclear and further research is needed to determine its effect on the prevalence and mechanisms of formation of elasmobranch twins.",

    "abstract": "Natural and synthetic nanoparticles composed of fivefold twinned crystal domains have distinct properties. The formation mechanism of these fivefold twinned nanoparticles is poorly understood. We used in situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy combined with molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate that fivefold twinning occurs through repeated oriented attachment of ~3-nanometer gold, platinum, and palladium nanoparticles. We discovered two different mechanisms for forming fivefold twinned nanoparticles that are driven by the accumulation and elimination of strain. This was accompanied by decomposition of grain boundaries and the formation of a special class of twins with a net strain of zero. These observations allowed us to develop a quantitative picture of the twinning process. The mechanisms provide guidance for controlling twin structures and morphologies across a wide range of materials.",

    "abstract": "The lack of obstetricians in Japan has prevented the implementation of a 24-hour delivery monitoring system for high-risk deliveries such as twin vaginal delivery at many obstetric facilities. To examine the outcomes of a 1-day trial of the vaginal delivery of twins at 36-37 weeks' gestation.\nWe induced the vaginal delivery of twins at 36-37 weeks' gestation of 256 women who provided consent between January 2007 and December 2016 using the following protocol: 1) administration of 0.5 mg oral prostaglandin E2 every 1 hour (maximum: 1.5 mg) in the morning; 2) intravenous administration of oxytocin and amniotomy in the afternoon; and 3) selection of caesarean delivery when vaginal delivery was not expected by evening. We examined their perinatal outcomes in a chart review.\nThe completion rates of vaginal delivery in total, nulliparous, and multiparous women were 79%, 72%, and 84%, respectively. There were no cases of neonatal asphyxia. The total incidence of neonatal respiratory disorders was 2.1%, but there were no cases of persistent pulmonary hypertension. The total incidence of postpartum hemorrhage requiring transfusion was 2.7%.\nThe 1-day planned vaginal delivery of twins at 36-37 weeks' gestation appears valid and safe, and our findings suggest that it can be an option for the delivery of twins.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to identify possible implications and risk factors in monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies having a bipartite placenta.\nBetween 2014 and 2019 data on such pregnancies was prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Monochorionicity was confirmed either by the presence of a T-sign, one chorion and two separate amnion cavities, or by histological examination postnatally. Bipartite placenta was diagnosed when two placenta lobes were identified with no placental connection between them. Risks of bipartite placenta in MCDA twins were evaluated by background data, prenatal and postnatal outcome.\nFive twin pregnancies were included in the study. 60 % (n = 3) were complicated by twin-twin-transfusion syndrome (TTTS), 20 % by selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) (n = 1) and 20 % (n = 1) by severe fetal malformations. In every case an intervention was indicated, but in only 60% (n = 3) possible, due to poor surgical conditions. Overall fetal\u00a0survival rate at birth was 90 %. Neonatal survival rate was 66.63%.\nBipartite placenta is a very rare phenomenon in MCDA twin pregnancies. It seems to be associated with a higher rate of complications, such as TTTS and sIUGR and might induce surgical difficulties in prenatal interventions.",

Skewed XCI toward one parental X has been observed in several complex human traits, but the extent to which genetics and environment influence skewed XCI is largely unexplored. To address this, we quantify XCI-skew in multiple tissues and immune cell types in a twin cohort. Within an individual, XCI-skew differs between blood, fat and skin tissue, but is shared across immune cell types. XCI skew increases with age in blood, but not other tissues, and is associated with smoking. XCI-skew is increased in twins with Rheumatoid Arthritis compared to unaffected identical co-twins. XCI-skew is heritable in blood of females >55 years old (h",

    "abstract": "Twins Research Australia (TRA) is a community of twins and researchers working on health research to benefit everyone, including twins. TRA leads multidisciplinary research through the application of twin and family study designs, with the aim of sustaining long-term twin research that, both now and in the future, gives back to the community. This article summarizes TRA's recent achievements and future directions, including new methodologies addressing causation, linkage to health, economic and educational administrative datasets and to geospatial data to provide insight into health and disease. We also explain how TRA's knowledge translation and exchange activities are key to communicating the impact of twin studies to twins and the wider community. Building researcher capability, providing registry resources and partnering with all key stakeholders, particularly the participants, are important for how TRA is advancing twin research to improve health outcomes for society. TRA provides researchers with open access to its vibrant volunteer membership of twins, higher order multiples (multiples) and families who are willing to consider participation in research. Established four decades ago, this resource facilitates and supports research across multiple stages and a breadth of health domains.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this retrospective case series were to investigate whether twins born with craniosynostosis mirrored each other regarding operative surgery performed, age of undertaking surgery; outcomes in speech, language, and developmental milestones and what environmental factors were present for each set of twins.Case selection was based on clinical and radiographical evidence of craniosynostosis amongst twin sets. The twin sets included were those with craniosynostosis who had different sutures affected or those with the same suture affected but with a varying degree of severity.The presence of the following factors may have played an influential role in the clinical presentation of the twins; these were as follows: a maternal history of smoking, breech presentation, and genetic mutations. It was notable that the overall outcomes for the twins in this study were similar.These cases highlight the multifactorial nature in the development of craniosynostosis and how this influenced the phenotypic presentation of the twins.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this longitudinal analysis of untreated monozygotic and dizygotic twins were to investigate vertical changes of the craniofacial structures during growth, to determine the concordance between genetically twins and to assess the genetic component for the various aspects of vertical growth.\nThe sample consisted of 34 pairs of untreated monozygotic twins (23 male, 11 female) and 30 untreated dizygotic siblings of multiple birth (8 male, 8 female and 14 mixed) from the Forsyth Moorrees Twin Study (1959-1975); lateral cephalograms taken from 6 to 18\u00a0years of age were analysed at 3-year intervals.\nCephalograms were traced, and longitudinal changes between twins in six angular and proportional vertical cephalometric variables (SN-NL, ML-NL, SN-ML, y-axis, PFH/AFH and LAFH/AFH) were analysed with intraclass correlation coefficients and linear regression modelling.\nThe concordance between monozygotic/dizygotic twins at 18\u00a0years of age was moderate to high with intraclass correlation coefficient values between 0.51 and 0.66. Additionally, sex differences in concordance at 18\u00a0years of age were found for three variables. High heritability (66%-79%) was observed for 5 of the 6 variables (LAFH/AFH, ML-NL, y-axis, SN-ML, PFH/AFH), while SN-NL showed limited heritability (34%).\nAlthough monozygotic/dizygotic twins share at least part of their genetic material, differences in the vertical dimension were found. This supports the complex developmental mechanism of the human face and the varying influence of genetic and environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Aging is intimately linked to system-wide metabolic changes that can be captured in blood. Understanding biological processes of aging in humans could help maintain a healthy aging trajectory and promote longevity. We performed untargeted plasma metabolomics quantifying 770 metabolites on a cross-sectional cohort of 268 healthy individuals including 125 twin pairs covering human lifespan (from 6\u00a0months to 82\u00a0years). Unsupervised clustering of metabolic profiles revealed 6 main aging trajectories throughout life that were associated with key metabolic pathways such as progestin steroids, xanthine metabolism, and long-chain fatty acids. A random forest (RF) model was successful to predict age in adult subjects (\u226516\u00a0years) using 52 metabolites (R",

    "abstract": "Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy or Kennedy disease (KD) is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a pathogenic CAG expansion in the first exon of the androgen receptor. Proximal muscle atrophy, weakness, contraction fasciculations, bulbar involvement, and sensory disturbances are part of the clinical picture of KD. We report the unusual genetic and phenotypic expression in 2 monozygotic twins. Genetic analysis has shown abnormal expansion of CAG repeat in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene on chromosome X different between the twin brothers (44, respectively, 46) but with large phenotypical differences including onset age, evolution, and clinical features. Disease began at age 31 for the first brother, respectively, and at 56 years for the second one and consisted of muscle wasting and progressive impairment of walking. In addition, the second brother did not manifest bulbar involvement 3 years after clinical onset and has more sensory features. Besides classical EMG testing, we evaluate sensory participation in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy with sudoscan device and confirmed the sensory deficit. We discussed epigenetic factors potentially involved in KD that could play a role in the phenotypical differences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case describing CAG trinucleotide repeats in monozygotic twins and also the first sudoscan diagnostic of sensory disturbances in Kennedy syndrome.",

The hiPSCs showed a normal karyotype, expressed pluripotency-associated markers, displayed the capacity for in vitro differentiation into the three germ layers and were Epstein Barr virus-free.

This study evaluates the association between birth order and perinatal mortality by birth order-specific weight difference in twin pregnancies.\nWe adopt generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) which are a flexible version of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), to model the association. Estimation of such models for correlated binary data is challenging. We compare both Bayesian and likelihood-based approaches for estimating GAMMs via simulation. We apply the methods to the US matched multiple birth data to evaluate the association between twins' birth order and perinatal mortality.\nPerinatal mortality depends on both birth order and relative birthweight. Simulation results suggest that the Bayesian method with half-Cauchy priors for variance components performs well in estimating all components of the GAMM. The Bayesian results were sensitive to prior specifications.\nWe adopted a flexible statistical model, GAMM, to precisely estimate the perinatal mortality risk differences between first- and second-born twins whereby birthweight and gestational age are nonparametrically modelled to explicitly adjust for their effects. The risk of perinatal mortality in twins was found to depend on both birth order and relative birthweight. We demonstrated that the Bayesian method estimated the GAMM model components more reliably than the frequentist approaches.",

    "abstract": "A gap exists in our mechanistic understanding of how genetic and environmental risk factors converge at the molecular level to result in the emergence of autism symptoms. We compared blood-based gene expression signatures in identical twins concordant and discordant for autism spectrum condition (ASC) to differentiate genetic and environmentally driven transcription differences, and establish convergent evidence for biological mechanisms involved in ASC.\nGenome-wide gene expression data were generated using RNA-seq on whole blood samples taken from 16 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins and seven twin pair members (39 individuals in total), who had been assessed for ASC and autism traits at age 12. Differential expression (DE) analyses were performed between (a) affected and unaffected subjects (\nIn the discordant twin analysis, three genes showed evidence for DE at FDR\u2009<\u200910%: \nIdentical twins stably discordant for ASC are rare, and as such the sample size was limited and constrained to the use of peripheral blood tissue for transcriptomic and methylomic profiling. Given these primary limitations, we focused on transcript-level analysis.\nUsing a cohort of ASC discordant and concordant MZ twins, we add to the growing body of transcriptomic-based evidence for an immune-based component in the molecular aetiology of ASC. Whilst the sample size was limited, the study demonstrates the utility of the discordant MZ twin design combined with multi-omics integration for maximising the potential to identify disease-associated molecular signals.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] is thought to be T cell mediated and therefore dependent on the interaction between the T cell receptor [TCR] and human leukocyte antigen [HLA] proteins expressed on antigen presenting cells. The collection of all TCRs in one individual, known as the TCR repertoire, is characterised by enormous diversity and inter-individual variability. It was shown that healthy monozygotic [MZ] twins are more similar in their TCR repertoire than unrelated individuals. Therefore MZ twins, concordant or discordant for IBD, may be useful to identify disease-related and non-genetic factors in the TCR repertoire which could potentially be used as disease biomarkers.\nEmploying unique molecular barcoding that can distinguish between polymerase chain reaction [PCR] artefacts and true sequence variation, we performed deep TCR\u03b1 and TCR\u03b2 repertoire profiling of the peripheral blood of 28 MZ twin pairs from Denmark and Germany, 24 of whom were discordant and four concordant for IBD.\nWe observed disease- and smoking-associated traits such as sharing, diversity and abundance of specific clonotypes in the TCR repertoire of IBD patients, and particularly in patients with active disease, compared with their healthy twins.\nOur findings identified TCR repertoire features specific for smokers and IBD patients, particularly when signs of disease activity were present. These findings are a first step towards the application of TCR repertoire analyses as a valuable tool to characterise inflammatory bowel diseases and to identify potential biomarkers and true disease causes.",

    "abstract": "This investigation examined whether the variation of cerebral structure is associated with genetic or environmental factors in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared with typically developing (TD) controls. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from twin pairs (aged 6-15\u00a0years) in which at least one twin was diagnosed with ASD or both were TD. Good quality data were available from 30 ASD, 18 discordant, and 34 TD pairs (n\u2009=\u2009164). Structural measures (volume, cortical thickness, and surface area) were generated with FreeSurfer, and ACE modeling was completed. Lobar structures were primarily genetically mediated in TD twins (a2\u2009=\u20090.60-0.89), except thickness of the temporal (a2\u2009=\u20090.33 [0.04, 0.63]) and occipital lobes (c2\u2009=\u20090.61 [0.45, 0.77]). Lobar structures were also predominantly genetically mediated in twins with ASD (a2\u2009=\u20090.70-1.00); however, thickness of the frontal (c2\u2009=\u20090.81 [0.71, 0.92]), temporal (c2\u2009=\u20090.77 [0.60, 0.93]), and parietal lobes (c2\u2009=\u20090.87 [0.77, 0.97]), and frontal gray matter (GM) volume (c2\u2009=\u20090.79 [0.63, 0.95]), were associated with environmental factors. Conversely, occipital thickness (a2\u2009=\u20090.93 [0.75, 1.11]) did not exhibit the environmental contributions that were found in controls. Differences in GM volume were associated with social communication impairments for the frontal (r\u2009=\u20090.52 [0.18, 0.75]), temporal (r\u2009=\u20090.61 [0.30, 0.80]), and parietal lobes (r\u2009=\u20090.53 [0.19, 0.76]). To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to suggest that environmental factors influence GM to a larger extent in children with ASD, especially in the frontal lobe.",

    "abstract": "Although acquisition of leukemia-associated somatic mutations by 1 or more hematopoietic stem cells is inevitable with advancing age, its consequences are highly variable, ranging from clinically silent clonal hematopoiesis (CH) to leukemic progression. To investigate the influence of heritable factors on CH, we performed deep targeted sequencing of blood DNA from 52 monozygotic (MZ) and 27 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs (aged 70-99 years). Using this highly sensitive approach, we identified CH (variant allele frequency \u22650.5%) in 62% of individuals. We did not observe higher concordance for CH within MZ twin pairs as compared with that within DZ twin pairs, or to that expected by chance. However, we did identify 2 MZ pairs in which both twins harbored identical rare somatic mutations, suggesting a shared cell of origin. Finally, in 3 MZ twin pairs harboring mutations in the same driver genes, serial blood samples taken 4 to 5 years apart showed substantial twin-to-twin variability in clonal trajectories. Our findings propose that the inherited genome does not exert a dominant influence on the behavior of adult CH and provide evidence that CH mutations may be acquired in utero.",

    "abstract": "Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is defined by mutations in myeloid cancer-associated genes with a variant allele frequency of at least 2%. Recent studies have suggested a possible genetic predisposition to CH. To further explore this phenomenon, we conducted a population-based study of 594 twins from 299 pairs aged 73 to 94 years, all with >20 years' follow-up. We sequenced DNA from peripheral blood with a customized 21-gene panel at a median coverage of 6179X. The casewise concordance rates for mutations were calculated to assess genetic predisposition. Mutations were identified in 214 (36%) of the twins. Whereas 20 twin pairs had mutations within the same genes, the exact same mutation was only observed in 2 twin pairs. No significant difference in casewise concordance between monozygotic and dizygotic twins was found for any specific gene, subgroup, or CHIP mutations overall, and no significant heritability could be detected. In pairs discordant for CHIP mutations, we tested if the affected twin died before the unaffected twin, as a direct measurement of the association of having CH when controlling for familial factors. A total of 127 twin pairs were discordant for carrying a mutation, and in 61 (48%) cases, the affected twin died first (P = .72). Overall, we did not find a genetic predisposition to CHIP mutations in this twin study. The previously described negative association of CHIP mutations on survival could not be confirmed in a direct comparison among twin pairs that were discordant for CHIP mutations.",

This case is notable because of the phenotypic differences between infants despite having identical genomes and causative variants. Also unique to this case is the clinical influence of early diagnosis using precision medicine techniques.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to compare the latency from membrane rupture to delivery and subsequent neonatal outcomes in twin gestations complicated by preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) of the presenting versus non-presenting sac.\nThis was a retrospective study of twin pregnancies over a 7-year period diagnosed with PPROM between 12 and 37 weeks gestation with a latency period to delivery of >24 hours. The ruptured sac was identified by ultrasound scan. The study compared the latency period from PPROM to delivery and subsequent neonatal morbidity and mortality resulting from rupture of the presenting versus non-presenting sac. Obstetric and neonatal outcomes were evaluated using a matched-cohort subset analysis (Canadian Task Force Classification II-2).\nDuring the study period, 77 twin pregnancies diagnosed with PPROM satisfied the inclusion criteria. The mean latency periods from PPROM to delivery were 10.1 days (n\u202f=\u202f7) when the presenting sac ruptured and 41.3 days (n\u202f=\u202f10) when the non-presenting sac ruptured (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Neonatal death was higher with PPROM of the presenting than the non-presenting sac (21.4% vs. 0%, respectively; P\u202f=\u202f0.05). Neonates were more likely to be affected by retinopathy of prematurity (57% vs. 19%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but less likely to have persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (0% vs. 25%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) when the rupture occurred in the presenting sac. The rates of other neonatal adverse outcomes were similar between the two groups.\nIn twin gestations there is a longer latency from PPROM to delivery and fewer neonatal complications when rupture occurs in the non-presenting rather than the presenting sac.",

    "abstract": "The cerebral cortex contains a significant quantity of intracortical myelin, but the genetics of cortical myelination (CM) in humans is not well understood. Relatively novel MRI-derived measures now enable the investigation of cortical myelination in large samples. In this study, we use a genetically-informative neuroimaging sample of 1096 young adult subjects from the Human Connectome Project in order to investigate genetic and environmental variation in CM and its relationships with cerebral surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT). We found that genetic factors account for approximately 50% of the observed individual differences in mean cortical myelin, 75% of the variation in total SA, and 85% of the variance in global mean CT. Although significant genetic influences were found throughout the cortex, both CM and SA demonstrated a posterior predominance, with disproportionately strong effects in the parietal and occipital lobes and significantly overlapping heritability maps (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Yet despite showing similar spatial heritability patterns, we found evidence that CM is genetically independent from SA at both global and vertex levels; genetically-mediated relationships between CM and CT were similarly small in magnitude. We also found small but statistically significant genetic associations between NIH Toolbox Total Cognition score and CM in the temporal lobe and insula. SA-cognition and CT-cognition correlations were less widespread compared to CM and both patterns were similar to those reported in prior studies.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate if hereditary factors, leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and metabolic health interact with resting fat oxidation (RFO) and peak fat oxidation (PFO) during ergometer cycling.\nWe recruited 23 male monozygotic twin pairs (aged 32-37\u00a0years) and determined their RFO and PFO with indirect calorimetry for 21 and 19 twin pairs and for 43 and 41 twin individuals, respectively. Using physical activity interviews and the Baecke questionnaire, we identified 10 twin pairs as LTPA discordant for the past 3\u00a0years. Of the twin pairs, 8 pairs participated in both RFO and PFO measurements, and 2 pairs participated in either of the measurements. We quantified the participants' metabolic health with a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test.\nFat oxidation within co-twins was correlated at rest [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)\u2009=\u20090.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-0.78] and during exercise (ICC\u2009=\u20090.67, 95% CI 0.33-0.86). The LTPA-discordant pairs had no pairwise differences in RFO or PFO. In the twin individual-based analysis, PFO was positively correlated with the past 12-month LTPA (r\u2009=\u20090.26, p\u2009=\u20090.034) and the Baecke score (r\u2009=\u20090.40, p\u2009=\u20090.022) and negatively correlated with the area under the curve of insulin (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.42, p\u2009=\u20090.015) and glucose (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.31, p\u2009=\u20090.050) during the oral glucose tolerance test.\nHereditary factors were more important than LTPA for determining fat oxidation at rest and during exercise. Additionally, PFO, but not RFO, was associated with better metabolic health.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate electrodeposition as a synthesis method for fabrication of Al coatings, up to 10 \u03bcm thick, containing a high density of genuine growth twins. This has not been expected since the twin boundary energy of pure Al is very high. TEM methods were used to analyze deposited Al and its nanoscaled twins. DFT methods confirmed that the influence of the substrate is limited to the layers close to the interface. Our findings are different from those achieved by sputtering of Al coatings restricted to a thickness less than 100 nm with twins dominated by epitaxial effects. We propose that in the case of electrodeposition, a high density of twins arises because of fast nucleation and is additionally promoted by a monolayer of adsorbed hydrogen originating from water impurities. Therefore, electrodeposition is a viable approach for tailoring the structure and properties of thicker, deposited Al coatings reinforced by twins.",

    "abstract": "Is B-cell CLL/lymphoma 6 (BCL6) endometrial expression, a surrogate biomarker of endometriosis, elevated in women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss (uRPL) and unexplained infertility (UI) compared to fertile subjects?\nEndometrial BCL6 expression is elevated to a similar degree in women with uRPL and UI compared to fertile controls.\nEndometriosis has been linked to the genesis of endometrial progesterone resistance and to specific nuclear proteins, including endometrial BCL6. BCL6 overexpression (immune histologic score\u2009>\u20091.4) has been strongly associated with poor reproductive outcomes in IVF cycles in women with UI. Our previous data have demonstrated an accuracy of 94% for diagnosing endometriosis, and BCL6 protein is elevated in the decidua of women with uRPL.\nIn this case-control study, at a tertiary university teaching hospital, 110 samples (control \nLH-timed endometrial biopsies were obtained from women with UI, uRPL (two or more consecutive losses) and normal fertile subjects during the mid-secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. Endometrial BCL6 protein levels were compared in women with UI and uRPL and fertile controls using western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (HSCORE).\nThe mean age of the uRPL group was significantly higher than the others [mean (SD)] control\u2009=\u200932.7 (2.6); uRPL\u2009=\u200935.8 (3.7); UI\u2009=\u200932.7 (4.4); \nWe studied subjects with two consecutive pregnancy losses rather than the definition adopted in Europe of three losses. The findings may lack external validity in other clinical settings (e.g. low prevalence of endometriosis).\nBased on the data presented here, we postulate that the degree of BCL6 expression may represent a continuum of progesterone resistance and response to inflammation that occurs in women with endometriosis, yielding different degrees of infertility, from uRPL to UI.\nThis study was supported by NICHD/NIH R01 HD067721 (SLY and BAL), by Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior: Grant 99999.003035/2015-08 (BAL) and by CAPES/PROAP (RFS).

    "abstract": "To develop a practical scoring system to assist clinicians in differentiating leptospirosis and hantavirus infections, whose epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics are literally like identical twins.\nThe study population consisted of 162 patients admitted to hospital with a confirmed diagnosis of leptospirosis (LG group, n\u2009=\u200992) and hantavirus infections (HG, group\u2009=\u200970) between January 2000 and January 2019. The two groups were compared in terms of demographic, clinical and laboratory features. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were determined from ROC analysis for findings of significance in the diagnosis of leptospirosis, and a scoring system for diagnosis was developed (\"MICE\" score). During the development of this scoring system, we were careful to employ parameters that would not affect one another statistically, to reflect the involvement of very different systems (such as the hematological, hepatic, renal, and musculoskeletal systems) due to the multisystemic effect of the disease in the organism, and to ensure that the system should be simple to apply and understand. Accordingly, five parameters, serum WBC, creatinine, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, and C-reactive protein, were employed in the \"MICE\" scoring system.\nThree cut-off values were determined using ROC analysis for the five parameters included in the MICE system. Accordingly, scores of 0, 1, or 2 were given based on the values WBC (/\u03bcL):\u2009\u2264\u20097500, 7500-15,000, and\u2009>\u200915,000; total bilirubin (mg/dL):\u2009\u2264\u20093, 3-10, and\u2009>\u200910; CRP (mg/dL):\u2009\u2264\u20095, 5-15, and\u2009>\u200915; creatinine (mg/dL):\u2009\u2264\u20091.5, 1.5-3, and\u2009>\u20093; CK (U/L):\u2009\u2264\u2009500, 500-1000,\u2009>\u20091000. AUC was calculated as 0.964 at ROC analysis, while the most noteworthy cut-off point was obtained when MICE score was\u2009\u2265\u20093, exhibiting 93.5% sensitivity, 92.9% specificity, PPV 94.5% and NPV 91.5%. A test score\u2009\u2265\u20093 was regarded as positive. In addition, our patients were evaluated using other current scoring systems in addition to \"MICE,\" and our scoring system exhibited a greater diagnostic power in our subjects.\nLeptospirosis and hantavirus infections can be accurately predicted by the MICE scoring system. Early diagnosis and rational treatment will also help to lower the mortality rates in these diseases.",

    "abstract": "We constructed a food-based diet quality score (DQS) and examined its association with obesity measures, eating styles and nutrient intakes. Participants were 3592 individuals (764 dizygotic [DZ] and 430 monozygotic [MZ] twin pairs) from the FinnTwin16 study. The DQS (0-12 points) was constructed from a short 14 item food frequency questionnaire. Anthropometric measures and eating styles were self-reported. Nutrient intakes were calculated from food diaries completed in a subsample of 249 individuals (45 same-sex DZ and 60 MZ twin pairs). Twins were analyzed both as individuals and as twin pairs. The DQS was inversely associated with body mass index (\u03b2 = -0.12, per one-unit increase in DQS, ",

    "abstract": "Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are characterized by lower extremity spasticity and weakness. HSP is often caused by mutations in SPG genes, but it may also be produced by inborn errors of metabolism. We performed next-generation sequencing of 4813 genes in one adult twin pair with HSP and severe muscular weakness occurring at the same age. We found two pathogenic compound heterozygous variants in MTHFR, including a variant not referenced in international databases, c.197C>T (p.Pro66Leu) and a known variant, c.470G>A (p.Arg157Gln), and two heterozygous pathogenic variants in POLG, c.1760C>T (p.Pro587Leu) and c.752C>T (p.Thr251Ile). MTHFR and POLG mutations were consistent with the severe muscle weakness and the metabolic changes, including hyperhomocysteinemia and decreased activity of both N(5,10)methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and complexes I and II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. These data suggest the potential role of MTHFR and POLG mutations through consequences on mitochondrial dysfunction in the occurrence of spastic paraparesis phenotype with combined metabolic, muscular, and neurological components.",

    "abstract": "The Longitudinal Israeli Study of Twins (LIST) focuses on the developmental, genetic and environmental contributions to individual differences in children's and adolescents' social behavior. Key variables have been empathy, prosocial behavior, temperament and values. Another major goal of LIST has been to study gene-environment correlations, mainly concerning parenting. LIST includes 1657 families of Hebrew-speaking Israeli twins who have participated at least once in the study. Children's environment and their development are assessed in a multivariate, multimethod fashion, including observed, parent-reported and self-reported data. The current article summarizes and updates recent findings from LIST. For example, LIST provided evidence for the heritability of human values with the youngest sample to date, and the first genetic investigation of adolescents' identity formation. Finally, future aims of LIST are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by maternal genetic deficiency of a gene that encodes E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase (gene symbol UBE3A) mapping to chromosome 15q11-q13. AS leads to stiff and jerky gait, excess laughter, seizures, and severe intellectual disability. In some parts of the brain, the paternally inherited UBE3A gene is subject to genomic imprinting by the action of the UBE3A-antisense transcript (UBE3A-ATS) on the paternally inherited allele. Consequently, only the maternally inherited UBE3A gene is expressed in mature neurons. AS occurs due to deletions of the maternal 15q11\u2009-\u200913 region, paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), imprinting center defects, mutations in the maternal UBE3A gene, or other unknown genetic malfunctions that result in a silenced maternal UBE3A gene in the specific imprinted regions of the brain.\nA potential treatment strategy for AS is to increase methylation of UBE3A-ATS to promote expression of the paternal UBE3A gene and thus ameliorate the clinical phenotypes of AS. We treated two sets of male identical twins with class I deletions with a 1 year treatment trial of either betaine and folic acid versus placebo. We found no statistically significant changes in the clinical parameters tested at the end of the 1 year trial, nor did we find any significant adverse events.\nThis study tested the hypothesis that by increasing the methylation of the UBE3A-antisense transcript in Angelman syndrome to promote expression of the silenced paternal UBE3A gene we may ameliorate the clinical phenotypes of AS. We treated two sets of identical twins with placebo versus betaine and folic acid. Although this study represented a novel approach to treating Angelman syndrome, the differences in the developmental testing results was not significant. This paper also discusses the value of monozygotic twin studies in minimizing confounding variables and its utility in conducting small treatment studies.\nNCT00348933 . Registered 6 July 2006.",

    "abstract": "Multisensory integration of information from the talker's voice and the talker's mouth facilitates human speech perception. A popular assay of audiovisual integration is the McGurk effect, an illusion in which incongruent visual speech information categorically changes the percept of auditory speech. There is substantial interindividual variability in susceptibility to the McGurk effect. To better understand possible sources of this variability, we examined the McGurk effect in 324 native Mandarin speakers, consisting of 73 monozygotic (MZ) and 89 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. When tested with 9 different McGurk stimuli, some participants never perceived the illusion and others always perceived it. Within participants, perception was similar across time (",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have identified over 120 risk loci for psoriasis. However, most of the variations are located in non-coding region with high frequency and small effect size. Pathogenetic variants are rarely reported except HLA-C*0602 with the odds ratio being approximately 4.0 in Chinese population. Although rare variations still account for a small proportion of phenotypic variances in complex diseases, their effect on phenotypes is large. Recently, more and more studies focus on the low-frequency functional variants and have achieved a certain amount of success.\nWhole genome sequencing and sanger sequencing was performed on 8 MZ twin pairs discordant for psoriasis to scan and verified the de novo mutations (DNMs). Additionally, 665 individuals with about 20 years' medical history versus 2054 healthy controls and two published large population studies which had about 8 years' medical history (including 10,727 cases versus 10,582 controls) were applied to validate the enrichment of rare damaging mutations in two DNMs genes. Besides, to verify the pathogenicity of candidate DNM in C3, RNA-sequencing for CD4\nA total of 27 DNMs between co-twins were identified. We found six of eight twins carry HLA-C\u22170602 allele which have large effects on psoriasis. And it is interesting that a missense mutation in SPRED1 and a splice region mutation in C3 are found in the psoriasis individuals in the other two MZ twin pairs without carrying HLA-C*0602 allele. In the replication stage, we found 2 loss-of-function (LOF) variants of C3 only in 665 cases with about 20 years' medical history and gene-wise analysis in 665 cases and 2054 controls showed that the rare missense mutations in C3 were enriched in cases (OR\u202f=\u202f1.91, P\u202f=\u202f0.0028). We further scanned the LOF mutations of C3 in two published studies (about 8 years' medical history), and found one LOF mutation in the case without carrying HLA-C*0602. In the individual with DNM in C3, RNA sequencing showed the expression level of C3 in skin was significant higher than healthy samples in public database (TPM fold change\u202f=\u202f1.40, P\u202f=\u202f0.000181) and ELISA showed protein C3 in peripheral blood was higher (~2.2-fold difference) than the other samples of twins without DNM in C3.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that DNM in C3 is the likely pathological mutations, and it provided a better understanding of the genetic etiology of psoriasis and additional treatments for this disease.",

    "abstract": "This article explores some rare sides of twin research. The focus of this article is the sad plight of the Dionne quintuplets, born in Canada in 1934. However, several other studies belong in this category, such as Dr Josef Mengele's horrifying twin research conducted at the Auschwitz concentration camp, Dr John Money's misguided attempt to turn an accidentally castrated male twin into a female, Russian scientists' cruel medical study of conjoined female twins and Dr Peter Neubauer's secret project that tracked the development of separated twins. Reviews of current twin research span twins' representation of self-image, twins with Kleine-Levin Syndrome, heteropaternal twinning in lemurs and factors affecting risk of dental caries. Media coverage includes a pair of high-society models, a book about the 'Winkelevii' twins, Super Bowl twin teammates, a family with three sets of fraternal twins, a twin sister surrogate and a near presidential twin.",

    "abstract": "The new West Japan Twins and Higher Order Multiple Births Registry was established by recruiting young twins and multiple births and by referrals from public health centers in the 1990s. The participants included in the survey comprised over 7800 twins and 4241 higher order multiples, and their families. Specifically, the present registry contains one of the largest triplet samples in the world. For these twins and multiples, data on year of delivery, mode of delivery, gestational age, intrapartum complications, longitudinal physical measures, motor milestones, cerebral palsy and feeding methods were obtained from records in the Maternal and Child Health Handbooks and schools. Participating mothers were asked to indicate family structure, parental educational history, maternal sleeping time, maternal health condition, maternal and paternal age at multiple delivery, complications during pregnancy, handedness of multiples and age at menarche of multiples. However, the zygosity differed among the various collaborating public health centers according to factors such as the time of investigation. Follow-up questionnaires have been mailed out every 3-4 years for longitudinal studies. This article describes the goals of this registry, recruitment of multiples and the focus of the study. The goals of this registry are not only to conduct research on human genetics and maternal and child health, but also to contribute to providing appropriate information for families with multiples.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins, considered genetically identical, cannot be distinguished using regular short tandem repeats (STR) typing, thus presenting a challenge for forensic geneticists. In paternity testing, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nuclear DNA can help distinguish MZ twins. However, the unique features of the mitochondrial genome, such as high copy number, small genome size, and high substitution rate, make it a promising source for applications in forensic science.\nWhole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on blood samples, and bioinformatic analysis was used to distinguish between MZ twins. Amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) was used to confirm the WGS results. This methodology was further applied to forensic samples from criminal cases. Amplicon sequencing was also performed to further exclude the innocent twin.\nThe monozygosity of the twins was confirmed using STR typing. Only one potential somatic mutation, m.6903\u202fT\u202f>\u202fC (2.6%), in the mitochondrial genome of one of the twins was verified when the sequence depth was set to 2000-fold, while no other distinguishing locus in the nuclear genome was identified. By dividing the number of C-reads by total reads, WGS data confirmed the amount of the minor component C to be 2.6%, which was further confirmed by ARMS-PCR. In addition, the heterogeneous locus was used to identify samples obtained from four criminal cases for forensic testing. Two heterogeneous loci in the sperm DNA of the other twin were identified by amplicon sequencing, and the amount of minor component T in m.6935C\u202f>\u202fT and m.6938C\u202f>\u202fT was estimated to be 17.91% and 18.79%, respectively.\nThe biological samples taken from the MZ twins were distinguished using a combination of WGS, allele-specific PCR, and deep-amplicon sequencing. Compared with nuclear DNA, mitochondrial DNA exhibited a higher potential for distinguishing between the MZ twins. The distinguishing feature of the mitochondrial DNA was the heterogeneous SNPs that occurred in only one twin. One SNP was further verified in the samples from the criminal cases and helped identify the perpetrator in case 1 and case 2. Furthermore, two heterogeneous SNPs found by amplicon sequencing helped to exclude the innocent twin in all four cases. Our findings demonstrated that a combination of deep sequencing and molecular analysis can be an effective way to distinguish between identical twins and can be used to analyze samples from criminal cases.",

    "abstract": "Corticostriatal circuits (CSC) have been implicated in the presentation of some restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRBs) in children with autism-spectrum disorder (ASD), and preliminary evidence suggests that disruptions in these pathways may be associated with differences in genetic and environmental influences on brain development. The objective of this investigation was to examine the impact of genetic and environmental factors on CSC regions in twins with and without ASD and to evaluate their relationship with the severity of RRBs.\nWe obtained T1-weighted MRIs from same-sex monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, aged 6\u201315 years. Good-quality data were available from 48 ASD pairs (n = 96 twins; 30 pairs concordant for ASD, 15 monozygotic and 15 dizygotic; 18 pairs discordant for ASD, 4 monozygotic and 14 dizygotic) and 34 typically developing control pairs (n = 68 twins; 20 monozygotic and 14 dizygotic pairs). We generated structural measures of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), caudate, putamen, pallidum and thalamus using FreeSurfer. Twin pair comparisons included intraclass correlation analyses and ACE modelling (a2 = additive genetics; c2 = common or shared environment; e2 = unique or nonshared environment). We also assessed correlations with RRB severity.\nStructural variation in CSC regions was predominantly genetically mediated in typically developing twins (a2 = 0.56 to 0.87), except for ACC white matter volume (a2 = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08 to 0.77). We also observed similar magnitudes of genetic influence in twins with ASD (a2 = 0.65 to 0.97), but the cortical thickness of the ACC (c2 = 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.66) and OFC (c2 = 0.60, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95) was primarily associated with environmental factors in only twins with ASD. Twin pair differences in OFC grey matter volume were also correlated with RRB severity and were predominantly environmentally mediated.\nWe obtained MRIs on 2 scanners, and analytical approaches could not identify specific genetic and environmental factors.\nGenetic factors primarily contribute to structural variation in subcortical CSC regions, regardless of ASD, but environmental factors may exert a greater influence on the development of grey matter thickness in the OFC and ACC in children with ASD. The increased vulnerability of OFC grey matter to environmental influences may also mediate some heterogeneity in RRB severity in children with ASD.",

    "results": "Structural variation in CSC regions was predominantly genetically mediated in typically developing twins (a2 = 0.56 to 0.87), except for ACC white matter volume (a2 = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08 to 0.77). We also observed similar magnitudes of genetic influence in twins with ASD (a2 = 0.65 to 0.97), but the cortical thickness of the ACC (c2 = 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.66) and OFC (c2 = 0.60, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95) was primarily associated with environmental factors in only twins with ASD. Twin pair differences in OFC grey matter volume were also correlated with RRB severity and were predominantly environmentally mediated.",

    "abstract": "Fetoplacental neuroblastoma metastasis has been postulated as a mechanism accounting for concordant cases where one twin develops a primary tumour and the second twin manifests the disease without an identifiable primary site. These tumours may originate and spread concomitantly due to the same genetic background shared by monozygotic twins. This study investigated the molecular profile of stage MS neuroblastoma presenting concomitantly in monozygotic twins. Comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) was done for each of the twin liver tumour and peripheral blood samples at diagnosis. Comparison of copy-number variation (CNV) regions revealed a set of CNVs that were common to both tumour specimens and not apparent in the blood. The CNV signature in both twins' tumours was highly similar, suggesting a common clonal origin. Additional findings included large deletion of chromosome 10 and amplification of chromosome 17. Notably, both liver samples had amplification of a short region involving DEIN (chromosome 4q34.1). Similar CNVs strongly support a common clonal origin and metastatic spread from one twin to the other. DEIN is a long-coding RNA (IncRNA) that has been found highly expressed in stage MS neuroblastoma and is likely involved in biological processes such as cell migration and metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the human blood circulation has been under investigation since its initial observation in 1948. Plasma cfDNA is known to be significantly elevated in diseased people. Due to possible variation in the population, evaluating cfDNA as a non-invasive biomarker at disease onset alone may not be sensitive enough to accurately diagnose diseases, particularly early stage cancers on a personal level. To understand the factors that define the cfDNA levels on the personal level and for better use as a non-invasive biomarker, we isolated cfDNA from the plasma of healthy individuals with varying degrees of genetic and/or environmental similarities (monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, sibling pairs, and unrelated individuals) as well as from patients with varying stages of breast and ovarian cancer undergoing treatment. Cell-free DNA levels were quantified by a fluorometer (ng/ml) and/or real-time PCR (copies/ml). The associations between individuals with various degrees of genetic and/or environmental similarities and their plasma cfDNA levels were evaluated. The ACE model (A = additive genetic, C = common environment, and E = specific environmental factors) was used to determine the proportion of each factor on the cfDNA levels. We found a high correlation (r = 0.77; p < 0.0001) in plasma cfDNA levels between monozygotic twins (n = 39). However, the correlation was gradually reduced to moderate (r = 0.47; p = 0.016) between dizygotic twins (n = 13) and low correlation (r = 0.28; p = 0.043) between sibling pairs (n = 26). The ACE model analysis showed that the plasma cfDNA level of a given healthy individual is influenced both by genetic and the environmental components in similar proportions (53% and 47%, respectively; A = 53%, C = 22.5%, E = 24.5%). Moreover, while age had no effect, gender significantly influenced the individual's plasma cfDNA level. As expected, cfDNA levels were significantly higher in both breast (n = 26) (p<0.0001) and ovarian (n = 64) (p<0.0001) cancer patients compared to the healthy individuals. Our study demonstrated that both genome and environmental factors modulate the individual's cfDNA level suggesting that its diagnostic sensitivity may be improved only if the person's cfDNA level is known prior to disease presentation.",

We provide epidemiologic trends in the US twin population from 1959 to 2000, current methods to identify zygosity, outcomes for identical twin transplants, and a comprehensive management strategy for identical twin kidney transplantation. By 2019, we project that 433\u00a0010 dizygotic and monozygotic twins will be alive and at risk for developing ESRF. Monozygosity between a donor-recipient pair can be confirmed by concordance in sex, blood type, and HLA antigen match with precision testing using 13/17 Short Tandem Repeat\u00a0sequencing to a likelihood of nearly 100%. Among identical twin transplants from 2001 to 2017, excellent patient and kidney graft survival rates were noted. Approximately 50% of kidney transplant recipients of identical twins transplant did not receive maintenance immunosuppression, and no differences in graft survival were noted among patients with and without immunosuppression at 6 and 12\u00a0months (P\u00a0=\u00a0.8 and .7). Patients with glomerulonephritis as the cause of ESRF had lower graft survival (P\u00a0=\u00a0.06) suggesting that recurrent glomerulonephritis as a likely cause of graft loss among these recipients.",

    "abstract": "Only few studies have investigated the genomewide transcriptome of normative cognitive aging. We therefore aimed at investigating blood gene expression patterns associated with cognitive aging using a population-based sample of 235 middle-aged monozygotic twin pairs with longitudinal data on cognitive function. This unique setup enabled examination of gene expression differences associated with individual and intrapair differences in cognitive level and change while controlling for underlying genetic variation and shared early environment. Overall, increased expression of several gene sets was found to strongly correlate with a lower cognitive level and cognitive decline. The most significantly correlated gene sets were related to protein metabolism, translation, RNA metabolism, infectious disease, and the immune system, which are all processes previously linked to transcription signatures of pathological and normal brain aging, and aging in blood. The results of our study thus suggest that gene expression patterns of cognitive level and decline in our sample mirror those seen in cognitively impaired individuals, which could point toward a more generic response to cognitive aging and aging in general.",

    "abstract": "We investigated key event-related brain potential markers (ERPs) derived from a flanked continuous performance task (CPT) and whether these would show phenotypic associations with ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) in a population-based sample. We further explored whether there was preliminary evidence that such ERPs could also index genetic risk for ADHD (depending on finding phenotypic associations). Sixty-seven male-only twin pairs (N = 134; aged 12-15) from a subsample of the Twins' Early Development Study, concordant and discordant for ADHD symptoms, performed the flanked CPT (or CPT-OX) while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. ERPs were obtained for cue (P3, CNV or contingency negative variation), go (P3, N2) and nogo trials (P3, N2). We found no phenotypic associations between CPT-derived ERPs and ADHD-the sizes of the estimated phenotypic correlations were nonsignificant and very small (r's = -.11 to .04). Twin-model fitting analyses using structural equation modelling provided preliminary evidence that some of the ERPs were heritable (with the most robust effect for go-P3 latency), but there was limited evidence of any genetic associations between ERPs and ADHD, although with the caveat that our sample was small and hence had limited power. Overall, unlike in previous research, there was no evidence of phenotypic (nor preliminary evidence for genetic) associations between ADHD and CPT-derived ERPs in this study. Hence, it may be currently premature for genetic analyses of ADHD to be guided by CPT-derived ERP parameters (unlike alternative cognitive-neurophysiological approaches which may be more promising). Further research with better-powered, population-based, genetically-informative and cross-disorder samples are required, which could be facilitated by emerging mobile EEG technologies.",

    "abstract": "Although mirror images are noted in some twins, no such reports are available for twins and subjects with schizophrenia.\nThe study was to assess the occurrence of mirror image finger patterns in apparent monozygotic twins with schizophrenia. Another objective was to elucidate these characteristics among sib pairs with schizophrenia for comparison with those of the twins.\nEight apparent monozygotic twin pairs and eight sib pairs with schizophrenia were investigated. The frequency of identical patterns in the right side finger of one twin and the corresponding left side finger of the other twin was assessed, and similarly on other sides. Similar assessment was made in sib pairs with schizophrenia and normal sib pairs.\nThe left middle finger pattern of one of the twin pair was found to be the mirror image of the right middle finger of the other twin in all the twin pairs studied and so was in seven of the sib pairs with schizophrenia. These mirror images of sib pairs with schizophrenia was more than those of normal sib pairs. This difference was accentuated with significantly more of these patterns in the twins in comparison to those among normal sib pairs. Notably, no difference emerged between the sib pairs with schizophrenia and the twins in any of their finger pairs.\nMirror images that are probably due to factors like abnormal genotypes and L- DNA, appear to be promising tools to study the etiology of schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "To assess the hemodynamic influence of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) on diastolic function, using left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) E/e' measured in the same cardiac cycle using the dual-gate Doppler (DD) method.\nThis study included 56 monochorionic twin pregnancies that underwent fetoscopic laser surgery (FLS) for TTTS in 2015-2018. E/e' by the DD method was measured 24 h before and 4-7 days after FLS.\nRecipients showed higher LV-E/e' Z score in stage I-, II-, and III-recipients (IIIr) and higher RV-E/e' Z score in stage III-donors and IIIr than donors (p < 0.05). After FLS, LV-E/e' Z score of recipients significantly decreased due to LV-E velocity Z score decrease (p < 0.05). RV-E/e' Z score after FLS significantly decreased due to RV-e' velocity Z score increase in recipients (p < 0.05).\nE/e' by the DD method helped assess cardiac changes of recipients. LV-E/e' could assess early hemodynamic changes by TTTS, and RV-E/e' can assess later influence on cardiac diastolic function. Furthermore, in recipient twins, the decrease in LV-E/e' after FLS might reflect the improvement of volume overload and the decrease in RV-E/e' might reflect the improvement of diastolic relaxation function in the RV.",

    "abstract": "Variants in GABRA1 have been associated with different epilepsies ranging from mild generalized forms to epileptic encephalopathies. Despite the broad clinical spectrum, phenotypes were found to be largely concordant within families. Contrary to this observation, we report monozygotic twin sisters with generalized epilepsy due to the c.541C>T; p.(Pro181Ser) de novo variant in GABRA1. One experienced juvenile absence seizures promptly responding to first-line medication, whereas the second developed severe treatment-refractory epilepsy with febrile, absence, atonic, and tonic-clonic seizures indicating marked intrafamilial variability in GABRA1-related epilepsy. Moreover, we provide a molecular characterization of the novel variant based on recently published structural data.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disabling disease of the CNS. Inflammatory features of MS include lymphocyte accumulations in the CNS and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The preclinical events leading to established MS are still enigmatic. Here we compared gene expression patterns of CSF cells from MS-discordant monozygotic twin pairs. Six \"healthy\" co-twins, who carry a maximal familial risk for developing MS, showed subclinical neuroinflammation (SCNI) with small MRI lesions. Four of these subjects had oligoclonal bands (OCBs). By single-cell RNA sequencing of 2752 CSF cells, we identified clonally expanded CD8+ T cells, plasmablasts, and, to a lesser extent, CD4+ T cells not only from MS patients but also from subjects with SCNI. In contrast to nonexpanded T cells, clonally expanded T cells showed characteristics of activated tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells. The TRM-like phenotype was detectable already in cells from SCNI subjects but more pronounced in cells from patients with definite MS. Expanded plasmablast clones were detected only in MS and SCNI subjects with OCBs. Our data provide evidence for very early concomitant activation of 3 components of the adaptive immune system in MS, with a notable contribution of clonally expanded TRM-like CD8+ cells.",

    "abstract": "Twin or multiple pregnancies often have neonatal complications. Common complications include low birth weight, respiratory distress, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (>5\u00a0days) and low APGAR score especially on second twin. (1) To compare referral rates of newborn hearing screening in twins and triplets between risk and non-risk babies for hearing loss, (2) to determine the effects of birth order on referral rates in twins and triplets. A retrospective study was carried out from the case records of the neonates enrolled in the referral based NICU hearing screening program during April 2013 to December 2014 at Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chennai. 1405 neonates (723 males and 682 females) in the age range of 3-28\u00a0days were screened during this period among which 76 were twins (38 pairs) and 9 were triplets (3 sets). We classified them further into non risk and risk babies among twins according to the Joint Committee for Infant Hearing (JCIH) recommendations. A dual step hearing screening protocol was used to screen the neonates. They were initially tested with distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) then with automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) before discharged from the hospital. Out of 76 (100%) twin babies 43 (56.58%) babies had one or more risk factors for hearing loss. Most common risk factors were low birth weight, premature birth, mechanical ventilation >5\u00a0days, hyperbilirubinemia, infections, ototoxic medications and family history of hearing loss. Each risk factor was observed in equal proportion in 1st born and 2nd born twins. 12 (15.76%) risk babies and 11 (14.47%) non risk babies failed in DPOAE testing. Out of 9 triplets babies (3 set) 3 babies had risk factors for hearing loss. One baby in 2nd born babies group failed AABR screening. Referral rates were slightly higher in 2nd born twins when compared to 1st born twins in DPOAE testing. Chi square test did not reveal any significant association between referral rates with risk factors and birth order (",

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a rare hereditary cerebellar ataxia showing mainly pure cerebellar ataxia. We herein report cases of SCA8 in Japanese monozygotic twins that presented with nystagmus, dysarthria, and limb and truncal ataxia. Their ATXN8OS CTA/CTG repeats were 25/97. They showed similar manifestations, clinical courses, and cerebellar atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging. Some of their pedigrees had nystagmus but not ataxia. These are the first monozygotic twins with SCA8 to be reported anywhere in the world. Although not all subjects with the ATXN8OS CTG expansion develop cerebellar ataxia, these cases suggest the pathogenesis of ATXN8OS repeat expansions in hereditary cerebellar ataxia.",

    "abstract": "We describe the use of virtual reality technology for surgical planning in the successful separation of thoracopagus conjoined twins. Three-dimensional models were created from computed tomography angiograms to simulate the patient's anatomy on a virtual stereoscopic display. Members of the surgical teams reviewed the anatomical models to localize an interatrial communication that allowed blood to flow between the two hearts. The surgical plan to close the 1-mm interatrial communication was significantly modified based on the pre-procedural spatial awareness of the anatomy presented in the virtual visualization. The virtual stereoscopic display was critical for the surgical team to successfully separate the twins and provides a useful case study for the use of virtual reality technology in surgical planning. Both twins survived the operation and were subsequently discharged from the hospital.",

    "abstract": "It is desirable for twin researchers to be aware of the needs and concerns of families of multiples and provide participants with appropriate and useful feedback and advice based on scientific evidence. Our most recent database on families with twins throughout Japan is based on a questionnaire survey conducted in 2016. Mailed questionnaires, consisting of over 500 items, were used to collect the basic data. The response rate was 38% (566/1478). This is part of a nationwide study designed to assess the long-term effect of perinatal conditions on mothers of multiples. Its aim was to study the growth and development of multiples in childhood, and for the creation of a multifetal mother and child health handbook, and to conduct a genetic epidemiologic study to test the developmental origin of health and disease hypothesis. One of the ultimate aims of this research was to provide evidence-based information on parenting of multiples for families with multiples.",

    "abstract": "The Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) is a longitudinal twin study that recruited over 16,000 twin-pairs born between 1994 and 1996 in England and Wales through national birth records. More than 10,000 of these families are still engaged in the study. TEDS was and still is a representative sample of the population in England and Wales. Rich cognitive and emotional/behavioral data have been collected from the twins from infancy to emerging adulthood, with data collection at first contact and at ages 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 21, enabling longitudinal genetically sensitive analyses. Data have been collected from the twins themselves, from their parents and teachers, and from the UK National Pupil Database. Genotyped DNA data are available for 10,346 individuals (who are unrelated except for 3320 dizygotic co-twins). TEDS data have contributed to over 400 scientific papers involving more than 140 researchers in 50 research institutions. TEDS offers an outstanding resource for investigating cognitive and behavioral development across childhood and early adulthood and actively fosters scientific collaborations.",

    "abstract": "Rotavirus has been associated with neonatal seizures and specific white matter magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities. We describe monochorionic twins who not only tested positive for rotavirus with these white matter MRI abnormalities but who also showed an electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern characteristic of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE), which has so far solely been described in epileptic encephalopathies with a poor prognosis. This report suggests that rotavirus infection must be added to the list of causes of EIEE EEG, and that the outcome then is likely more favorable. As MRI and EEG signs of rotavirus encephalopathy were present in one twin with only subtle neurologic symptoms, rotavirus may well cause insidious central nervous system complications more often. We suggest considering rotavirus infection in neonates presenting with seizures, and to add rotavirus infection to the differential diagnosis of EIEE.",

    "abstract": "The debate upon the relative importance of nature vs nurture in the development of human behaviour can be traced back to ancient times. Traditional epidemiology and genetic epidemiology have confirmed the association of environmental and genetic factors with behavioural traits. Current genomic studies are identifying genetic variants associated with various behavioural traits. However, exploring the relationship of abundant environmental factors with the complex epigenome that mediates human behaviour is just at its beginning. Identical twins can serve as perfect experiments for studying the environmental impact on behavioural epigenetics advantaged by enriched power in association analysis due to controlling of their genetic make-ups. Recent development in causal inference using twin-based models adds more values in twins. This review briefly introduces the various approaches in making use of twins in studying behavioural epigenetics from experiment design to practical applications. Exploring the epigenome of twins using the powerful twin-based study designs and analytical approaches will help identifying causal epigenetic markers mediating environmental exposures and behavioural traits enabling both pharmaceutical intervention and effective prevention.",

    "abstract": "Most studies have revealed that the incidence of morbidity and mortality of preterm male infants is greater than that of preterm female infants. Recently, conflicting outcomes have been reported regarding mixed-gender twins. The aim of this study was to estimate the association between gender and outcome in newborn twins of different gender.\nWe conducted a retrospective review of mixed-gender twins weighing < 1500\u2009g that were born at Shamir Medical Center (Assaf Harofeh) between the years 1995 and 2016 (158 newborns). The incidence of morbidity and mortality until discharge from the hospital were evaluated while looking at gender differences.\nNo significant differences were found in neonatal mortality or morbidity between females and males from different-gender twins. Even after considering confounding variables (gestational age, birth weight & birth order) in linear and logistic regression models, no significant differences were found between the genders.\nOur study suggests that there are no significant differences in neonatal mortality or morbidity among different-gender twins. Our results support the need for further studies.",

    "abstract": "Multifetal gestation is often complicated by the development of preeclampsia. In some twin gestations, preeclampsia develops in association with restricted fetal growth of only one fetus. Instead of termination of the entire pregnancy, we investigated an alternative approach to the management of such pregnancies that might allow unharmed survival of the normal twin. We present a case of preeclampsia in twin discordance with severe fetal growth restriction at 25 weeks of gestation. Preeclampsia was linked to a lethal condition in one twin and was treated with selective feticide in an effort to reverse preeclampsia. Inasmuch as the fetal prognosis was extremely poor for the abnormal fetus, selective feticide was a reasonable therapeutic option. Maternal symptoms resolved, allowing continuation of the pregnancy for 4 weeks before delivery of the healthy fetus. We maintain that selective termination induced a decrease in the release of substances involved in the physiopathology of preeclampsia, which allowed the continuation of the pregnancy with close follow-up. This report highlights the link between placental pathology and the disease process of preeclampsia and further supports selective termination as a reasonable management strategy in carefully selected cases of discordant twins.",

    "abstract": "The Children of the Twins Early Development Study (CoTEDS) is a new prospective children-of-twins study in the UK, designed to investigate intergenerational associations across child developmental stages. CoTEDS will enable research on genetic and environmental factors that underpin parent-child associations, with a focus on mental health and cognitive-related traits. Through CoTEDS, we will have a new lens to examine the roles that parents play in influencing child development, as well as the genetic and environmental factors that shape parenting behavior and experiences. Recruitment is ongoing from the sample of approximately 20,000 contactable adult twins who have been enrolled in the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) since infancy. TEDS twins are invited to register all offspring to CoTEDS at birth, with 554 children registered as of May 2019. By recruiting the second generation of TEDS participants, CoTEDS will include information on adult twins and their offspring from infancy. Parent questionnaire-based data collection is now underway for 1- and 2-year-old CoTEDS infants, with further waves of data collection planned. Current data collection includes the following primary constructs: child mental health, temperament, language and cognitive development; parent mental health and social relationships; parenting behaviors and feelings; and other socioecological factors. Measurement tools have been selected with reference to existing genetically informative cohort studies to ensure overlap in phenotypes measured at corresponding stages of development. This built-in study overlap is intended to enable replication and triangulation of future analyses across samples and research designs. Here, we summarize study protocols and measurement procedures and describe future plans.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the structural similarity of the optic disc and peripapillary region between monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs. Through these analyses, we sought to determine whether these structures are more likely to be affected by genetic or environmental factors.\nUsing fundus photographs of 362 MZ twins, cup-to-disc ratio, tilt ratio of the optic disc, and the angle between the major temporal retinal vessels were measured. We also checked for the presence of peripapillary atrophy (PPA) and, if present, recorded its size and direction. We compared the level of consistency of these parameters and axial length (AL) between the right and left eyes within each individual and also between the corresponding paired eyes of the twins. Subgroup analysis was performed according to age and the difference in the AL between the twin pairs.\nThe mean (SD) age of the twins included in this study was 38.6 years (8.1). The size of the PPA was significantly correlated with the AL, but not with the intraocular pressure. For PPA-related factors, the level of consistency was weaker between corresponding paired eyes of the twins than between the right and left eyes within each individual. The level of consistency of the AL was the strongest in both comparisons. The level of consistency of both PPA-related factors and tilt ratio between the corresponding paired eyes of the twins was weaker in the group with a larger intertwin difference of AL than in the group with a smaller difference. Subgroup analyses by age (older age group, 45.3\u00b16.3\u2009y; younger age group, 32.4\u00b12.7\u2009y) showed that the level of consistency of PPA-related factors was weaker in the older age group than in the younger age group, after adjusting the AL.\nUnlike AL and cup-to-disc ratio, similarity of PPA between MZ twins decreased with age, suggesting that PPA could be formed as a result of various factors in addition to genetic ones.",

    "results": "The mean (SD) age of the twins included in this study was 38.6 years (8.1). The size of the PPA was significantly correlated with the AL, but not with the intraocular pressure. For PPA-related factors, the level of consistency was weaker between corresponding paired eyes of the twins than between the right and left eyes within each individual. The level of consistency of the AL was the strongest in both comparisons. The level of consistency of both PPA-related factors and tilt ratio between the corresponding paired eyes of the twins was weaker in the group with a larger intertwin difference of AL than in the group with a smaller difference. Subgroup analyses by age (older age group, 45.3\u00b16.3\u2009y; younger age group, 32.4\u00b12.7\u2009y) showed that the level of consistency of PPA-related factors was weaker in the older age group than in the younger age group, after adjusting the AL.",

    "abstract": "Localized aggressive periodontal disease is an uncommon finding observed in adolescents and children. Studies have been conducted to elucidate the etiology, contributing factors, and genetic roles in the phenomena. In particular, twin studies have shown genetic makeup to be a substantial risk factor for periodontitis. This case is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first to be presented in literature of a same dwelling, set of monozygotic twins, displaying similar presentation of localized aggressive periodontitis, however with different microbial profiles.\nA set of 17-year-old black male monozygotic twins were referred for a full-mouth periodontal evaluation and any necessary periodontal treatment on July 7, 2007. A full-mouth radiographic series, periodontal charting, and intraoral photographs were performed on each individual. A family history was obtained through the biological mother, which yielded no known history of early tooth loss or treatment of severe periodontal disease. The father was not involved in the rearing of the children and his periodontal history was unavailable. An initial and surgical treatment plan was developed. Microbial analysis of subgingival plaque samples was collected on the affected sites. Initial treatment with scaling and root planing, subgingival irrigation, with administration of systemic antibiotics, and oral hygiene instruction, were rendered on both individuals.\nWithin limitations of this report, it is demonstrated that different microbial pattern exists on aggressive periodontitis even in genetically identical individuals with the same environmental exposure.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twining is a rare medical phenomenon, with an overall prevalence of 1.47 per 100\u2009000 births. This report describes a successful separation of xypho-omphalopagus conjoined twins complicated by unbalanced blood shunting through the porto-systemic anastomoses within the shared liver parenchyma. Significant extrauterine twin-twin transfusion syndrome caused by unbalanced shunting is an extremely rare, and probably under-recognized, hemodynamic complication in conjoined twins necessitating urgent separation. Progressive deterioration with a poor outcome can be prevented if the condition is recognized in a timely manner.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a severe and debilitating mental disorder diagnosed by evaluation of affective, cognitive and physical depression symptoms. Severity of these symptoms strongly impacts individual's quality of life and is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. One of the molecular mechanisms allowing for an interplay between these factors is DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification playing a pivotal role in regulation of brain functioning across lifespan. The aim of this study was to investigate if there are DNA methylation signatures associated with depression symptomatology in order to identify molecular mechanisms contributing to pathophysiology of depression. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of continuous depression symptomatology score measured in a cohort of 724 monozygotic Danish twins (346 males, 378 females). Through EWAS analyses adjusted for sex, age, flow-cytometry based blood cell composition, and twin relatedness structure in the data we identified depression symptomatology score to be associated with blood DNA methylation levels in promoter regions of neuropsin (KLK8, p-value\u2009=\u20094.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910",

    "abstract": "The 2020 Strategic Impact Goal introduced by the American Heart Association (AHA) aims at improving cardiovascular health (CVH) of all Americans by 20%. AHA defined ideal CVH across seven established modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Prior studies have indicated that ideal CVH also benefits brain health and cognitive aging, but it is possible that this association is explained by familial factors.\nWe examined 272 male monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs (total 544 subjects) free of overt cardiovascular disease and dementia from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Memory and learning were measured by Trail Making tests and Wechsler Memory Scale (Immediate and Delayed Memory tests and Visual Reproductive Test). Each of the seven CVH components (smoking, body mass index, physical activity, diet, total cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose) was scored per established criterion.\nThe mean age of the twins was 55 years, 96% were whites, and 61% monozygotic. When considering twins as individuals, for every unit increase in CVH score (indicating better cardiovascular health), twins demonstrated faster cognitive processing speed (Trail B: - 5.6\u200as, 95% CI - 10.3, - 0.9; p\u200a=\u200a0.03) and better story recall, both immediate (0.35, 95% CI 0.06, 0.62; p\u200a=\u200a0.02) and delayed (0.39, 95% CI 0.08, 0.70; p\u200a=\u200a0.01).\nBetter CVH is associated with better cognitive health in several domains. As suggested by within-pair analysis, this association is largely explained by familial factors, implying that early life exposures are shared determinants of both brain health and cardiovascular health.",

    "abstract": "Although intertwin size difference is an important measure of fetal growth, the appropriate cut point to define discordance is unclear. Few studies have assessed intertwin differences in estimated fetal weight longitudinally or in relation to size differences at birth.\nThe objectives of the study were to estimate the magnitude of percentage differences in estimated fetal weight across gestation in dichorionic twins in relation to a fixed discordance cut point and compare classification of aberrant fetal growth by different measures (estimated fetal weight differences, birthweight discordance, small for gestational age).\nWomen aged 18-45 years from 8 US centers with dichorionic twin pregnancies at 8 weeks 0 days to 13 weeks 6 days gestation planning to deliver in participating hospitals were recruited into the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies-Dichorionic Twins study and followed through delivery (n\u00a0= 140; 2012-2013). Ultrasounds were conducted at 6 targeted study visits to obtain fetal biometrics and calculate estimated fetal weight. Percent estimated fetal weight and birthweight differences were calculated: ([weight\nMedian estimated fetal weight percentage difference increased across gestation (5.9% at 15.0, 8.4% at 38.0 weeks), with greater disparities at higher percentiles (eg, 90th percentile: 15.6% at 15.0, 26.3% at 38.0 weeks). As gestation advanced, an increasing percentage of pregnancies were classified as discordant using a fixed cut point: 10% at 27.0, 15% at 34.0, and 20% at 38.0 weeks. Birthweight discordance and small for gestational age classifications differed (P\u00a0= .002); for birthweight discordance \u226518% vs <18%: 44% vs 71% had neither small for gestational age; 56% vs 18% had 1 small for gestational age; no cases (0%) vs 11% had both small for gestational age, respectively. Estimated fetal weight percent difference varied across gestation by birthweight discordance plus small for gestational age classification (P\u00a0= .040). Estimated fetal weight percentage difference increased with birthweight discordance \u226518% (neither small for gestational age: 0.46%/week [95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.84]; 1 small for gestational age: 0.57%/week [95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.90]) but less so without birthweight discordance (neither small for gestational age: 0.17%/week [95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.28]; 1 small for gestational age: 0.03%/week [95% confidence interval, -0.17 to 0.24]); both small for gestational age: 0.10%/week [95% confidence interval, -0.15 to 0.36]).\nThe percentage of dichorionic pregnancies exceeding a fixed discordance cut point increased over gestation. A fixed cut point for defining twin discordance would identify an increasing percentage of twins as discordant as gestation advances. Small for gestational age and percentage weight differences assess distinct aspects of dichorionic twin growth. A percentile cut point may be more clinically useful for defining discordance, although further study is required to assess whether any specific percentile cut point correlates to adverse outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Variation in facial emotion processing abilities may contribute to variability in penetrance for psychotic symptoms in 22q11.2DS. However, the precise nature of the social cognitive dysfunction (i.e., facial expression perception vs. emotion recognition), the potential additional roles of genetic and environmental variabilities, and consequently the possibility of using this neurocognitive marker in clinical monitoring remain unclear. The present case study aimed at testing the hypothesis that when confounding factors are controlled, the presence of psychotic symptoms in 22q11.2DS is associated, at the individual level, with a neural marker of facial expression perception rather than explicit emotional face recognition. Two monozygotic twins with 22q11.2DS discordant for psychiatric manifestations performed (1) a classical facial emotion labelling task and (2) an implicit neural measurement of facial expression perception using a frequency-tagging approach in electroencephalography (EEG). Analysis of the periodic brain response elicited by a change of facial expression from neutrality indicated that the twin with psychotic symptoms did not detect emotion among neutral faces while the twin without the symptoms did. In contrast, both encountered difficulties labelling facial emotion. The results from this exploratory twin study support the idea that impaired facial expression perception rather than explicit recognition of the emotion expressed might be a neurocognitive endophenotype of psychotic symptoms that could be reliable at a clinical level. Although confirmatory studies should be required, it facilitates further discussion on the etiology of the clinical phenotype in 22q11.2DS.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the long-term neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes in surviving infants of pregnancies with spontaneous twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS), to compare outcome between donors and recipients, and to investigate potential risk factors for neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI).\nThis was a retrospective study of a consecutive cohort of spontaneous-TAPS survivors delivered between 2005 and 2017 at the Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands. Neurological, motor, cognitive and behavioral development were assessed at a median age of 4\u2009years. The primary outcome was NDI, which was a composite outcome of cerebral palsy, deafness, blindness and motor and/or cognitive delay. NDI was subdivided into two grades of severity: mild-to-moderate and severe NDI. Outcome was compared between surviving donor and recipient twins. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess risk factors for NDI.\nForty-nine twin pregnancies complicated by spontaneous TAPS were eligible for inclusion. The perinatal survival rate was 83% (81/98) of twins. Neurodevelopmental assessment was performed in 91% (74/81) of surviving twins. NDI occurred in 30% (22/74) of TAPS survivors, and was found more often in donors (44%; 15/34) than in recipients (18%; 7/40) (odds ratio (OR), 4.1; 95%\u2009CI, 1.8-9.1; P\u2009=\u20090.001). Severe NDI was detected in 9% (7/74) of survivors and was higher in donors compared with recipients (18% (6/34) vs 3% (1/40)), although the difference did not reach statistical significance; P\u2009=\u20090.056). Donors demonstrated lower cognitive scores compared with recipients (P\u2009=\u20090.011). Bilateral deafness was identified in 15% (5/34) of donors compared with 0% (0/40) of recipients (P\u2009=\u20090.056). Parental concern regarding development was reported more often for donor than for recipient twins (P\u2009=\u20090.001). On multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for NDI were gestational age at delivery (OR, 0.7; 95%\u2009CI, 0.5-0.9; P\u2009=\u20090.003) and severe anemia (OR, 6.4; 95%\u2009CI, 2.4-17.0; P\u2009<\u20090.001).\nSurviving donor twins of pregnancies complicated by spontaneous TAPS have four-fold higher odds of NDI compared with recipient cotwins, are at increased risk of cognitive delay and have a high rate of deafness.

    "abstract": "A growing evidence base supports early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) for young children with autism spectrum disorder. We have found only one study exploring the outcome of EIBI for children with Rett syndrome, which reported little effect. It suggested that future studies should employ more fine-grained outcome measures. We provided EIBI for twin 3-year-old girls with Rett syndrome for a period of 3 years. We analyzed raw scores and standard scores from a measure of adaptive behavior and a detailed assessment of skills across 25 areas. We detected moderate but clinically meaningful gains in areas such as communication and self-help. Gains are discussed from a quality of life perspective and whether the moderate effects can justify the resources required in EIBI.",

    "abstract": "The chromatin remodeling AT-Rich interaction domain containing 1B protein (ARID1B) also known as BAF-associated factor, 250-KD, B (BAF250B) codified by the ARID1B gene (MIM#614556), is a small subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF or BAF complex, an ATP-dependent protein machinery which is able to activate or repress gene transcription, allowing protein access to histones through DNA relaxed conformation. ARID1B gene mutations have been associated with two hereditary syndromic conditions, namely Coffin-Siris (CSS, MIM#135900) and Nicolaides-Baraitser syndromes (NCBRS, MIM#601358), characterized by neurodevelopment delay, craniofacial dysmorphisms and skeletal anomalies. Furthermore, intellectual impairment and central nervous system (CNS) alterations, comprising abnormal corpus callosum, have been associated with mutations in this gene. Moreover, ARID1B anomalies resulted to be involved in neoplastic events and Hirschprung disease. Here we report on two monozygotic male twins, displaying clinical appearance strikingly resembling NCBRS and CSS phenotype, who resulted carriers of a novel 6q25.3 microdeletion, encompassing only part of the ARID1B gene. The deleted segment was not inherited from the only parent tested and afflicted the first exons of the gene, coding for protein disordered region. We also provide, for the first time, a review of previously published ARID1B mutated patients with NCBRS and CSS phenotype and a computer-assisted dysmorphology analysis of NCBRS and ARID1B related CSS individuals, through the Face2Gene suite, confirming the existence of highly overlapping facial gestalt of both conditions. The present findings indicate that ARID1B could be considered a contributing gene not only in CSS but also in NCBRS phenotype, although the main gene related to this latter condition is the SMARCA2 gene (MIM#600014), another component of the BAF complex. So, ARID1B study should be considered in such individuals.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in KDM5C (lysine (K)-specific demethylase 5C) were causally associated with up to 3% of X-linked intellectual disability (ID) in males. By exome and Sanger sequencing, a novel frameshift KDM5C variant, predicted to eliminate the JmjC catalytic domain from the protein, was identified in two monozygotic twins and their older brother, which was inherited from their clinically normal mother, who had completely skewed X-inactivation. DNA methylation (DNAm) data were evaluated using the Illumina 450\u202fK Methylation Beadchip arrays. Comparison of methylation levels between the three patients and male controls identified 399 differentially methylated CpG sites, which were enriched among those CpG sites modulated during brain development. Most of them were hypomethylated (72%), and located mainly in shores, whereas the hypermethylated CpGs were more represented in open sea regions. The DNAm changes did not differ between the monozygotic twins nor between them and their older sibling, all presenting a global hypomethylation, similar to other studies that associated DNA methylation changes to different KDM5C mutations. The 38 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were enriched for H3K4me3 marks identified in developing brains. The remarkable similarity between the methylation changes in the monozygotic twins and their older brother is indicative that these epigenetic changes were mostly driven by the KDM5C mutation.",
