    "abstract": "Healthcare is one of the domains in which artificial intelligence (AI) is already having a major impact. Of interest is the idea of the digital twin (DT), an AI-powered technology that generates a real-time representation of the patient's body, offering the possibility of more personalised care. Our main thesis in this paper is that the DT does not merely represent the patient's body but produces a specific body. We argue, from a philosophical perspective and an ethical-phenomenological approach, that the virtual body created by the DT has a major impact on one's self-understanding, having consequences for gender expression and identification, and for health. This has deep implications for people who do not conform to gender normativity, for example, trans individuals. We advocate that, with thoughtful development, DT technology can and should be empowering, contributing to better addressing the diversity of bodies and facilitating trans people's experience in healthcare contexts.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence links per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure and metabolic disruptions to fetal growth retardation. However, earlier studies on singletons couldn't fully account for genetic factors. Therefore, we used a co-twin control study design to identify cord metabolomic signatures of PFAS exposure and assess its mediating role in twin birthweight discordance. We analyzed 204 twin neonates born from the Wuhan Twin Birth Cohort (August 2016-January 2018). Cord serum PFAS concentrations and untargeted metabolomic profiles were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Within-twin metabolome-wide association analyses identified 69 metabolites (effect coefficients: 0.09-0.35) positively associated with log2-transformed perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) difference and 51 metabolites (effect coefficients: 0.08-0.38) positively associated with log2-transformed perfluoroheptane sulfonate (PFHpS) difference after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. PFAS-associated metabolites were primarily enriched in steroid hormone biosynthesis, arginine and proline metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathways. Five amino acids, one carbohydrate, one cofactor and vitamin, and five lipids mediated the relationship between PFHpS exposure difference and intra-twin birthweight difference, with mediation proportions ranging from 32.0% to 72.7%. This study is the first to use a within-twin comparison, providing new insights into the underlying mechanisms linking PFAS exposure with twin birthweight discordance.",

    "abstract": "Identify microbial and microbiota-associated metabolites in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins discordant for type 1 diabetes (T1D) to gain insight into potential environmental factors that may influence T1D.\nSerum samples from 39 twins discordant for T1D were analyzed using a semi-targeted metabolomics approach via liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS). Statistical analyses identified significant metabolites (p < 0.1) within three groups: All twins (combined group), MZ twins, and DZ twins.\nThirteen metabolites were identified as significant. 3-indoxyl sulfate and 5-hydroxyindole were significantly reduced in T1D individuals across all groups. Carnitine was reduced, and threonine, muramic acid, and 2-oxobutyric acid were significantly elevated in both All and MZ groups. Allantoin was significantly reduced and 3-methylhistidine was significantly elevated in All and DZ groups.\nMetabolite dysregulation associated with gut dysbiosis was observed. However, further validation of our findings in a larger cohort is needed.\nWhy did we undertake this study? We believed this cohort of twins discordant for type 1 diabetes (T1D) would allow for control over genetic variability to examine environmental factors.What is the specific question(s) we wanted to answer? We aimed to identify differences in microbial and microbiota-associated metabolites in twins discordant for T1D to examine the effect of the gut microbiome on T1D.What did we find? Thirteen metabolites were identified as significantly different.What are the implications of our findings? Our results show the dysregulation of several microbial metabolites in twin pairs, suggesting that the gut microbiome plays a role in the pathogenesis of T1D.",

    "abstract": "The Italian 12th-century copper alloy doors of Barisanus have long been the subject of art historical studies and have recently been fully documented photogrammetrically and archaeometrically. In addition, digital twins of the three Barisanus doors in Ravello, Trani and Monreale have been produced and made available in open access for further research. These digital twins, together with the orthophotos produced, allow precise and repeatable measurements of the different metal parts of the doors, such as panels and frieze elements. This, and by taking into account the solid shrinkage of metals during the casting process, allowed for the reconstruction of the production sequence for each of the 20 single motif panels present on all three doors, and, finally, also for the establishment of the production sequence of the three doors as a whole-heavily discussed in art history research-with rather astonishing results. Moreover, bronze casting techniques used and the use of moulds and models are discussed, painting a more detailed picture that goes beyond the often purported dichotomy of lost wax vs. sand casting.",

    "abstract": "Artificial phantoms play an important role in the development of body-area radio-communication devices and networks. This work aims to design, fabricate and validate physical anthropomorphic phantoms (PAP) of torso with their complementary digital twin models (DTM) emulating the anatomical and dielectric properties of the human body. Two PAPs-an obese lower abdomen and an athletic upper thorax- were designed and fabricated, with their DTMs. These PAPs cover both the ends of adult human body type spectrum. The heterogeneous phantoms consist of layers representing: skin, fat, muscle, rib cage, spinal column, and internal organ, fabricated using semi-solid, low water content materials. The phantoms were validated by comparing their dielectric properties with the IFAC database. The PAPs and DTMs were analyzed for the performance and safety of implantable/on-body radio-communication devices by measuring the values of reflection coefficient (S11) and simulating specific absorption rate (SAR). The results obtained are: (1) strong agreement of tissue layers' dielectric properties with the IFAC database over 0.5-10 GHz frequency range; (2) dielectric, physical, and mechanical stability for at least 16 months after fabrication; (3) (re)usability and implantability of the developed PAPs for communication studies on the performance and safety of implantable/on-body devices; (4) reliability of developed DTMs for SAR analysis of implantable and on-body devices.",

    "abstract": "AI-enabled digital twins (DTs) are advanced virtual models of a complex real-world system, augmented with predictive AI capabilities, which have a potential for transforming healthcare and clincial decision making. Despite the growing interest and need in such DTs, the literature lacks a unified framework for its development and implementation.\nThis study aims to map the existing knowledge on AI-enabled DTs for clinical decision-making, and develop a comprehensive framework for its development and implementation.\nInformed by the scoping review frameworks established by Arksey and O'Malley, and the Joanna Briggs Institute, we performed a scoping review of studies reporting on the development and implementation of AI-enabled DTs for clinical decision-making in any healthcare setting. The search strategy was developed by a professional academic librarian for three databases, i.e., PubMed, Embase (Ovid), and IEEE Xplore, from the date of inception until August 2023. We also conducted a grey literature search on Google Scholar. Moreover, we scanned the references of all included studies to identify additional potentially relevant studies for inclusion. A reviewer screened titles and abstracts, full-text articles, and charted data, and the second reviewer verified them. Data were summarised descriptively using content analysis. Key steps in DTs development were identified and combined to create the DECIDE-Twin framework.\nOut of 421 records, 11 were included: seven reviews and four empirical studies, all published from 2020 onward. The reviews contained either a framework or information that was used to construct our newly developed framework. The empirical studies reported the development of DTs, and one reported a common infrastructure for a wide range of applications for DTs.\nWe developed the DECIDE-Twin framework that could serve as a guide for researchers and practitioners for the development and implementation of AI-enabled DTs in clinical decision making. Further research is needed to validate and implement this framework across various use cases.",

    "abstract": "Early treatment in spinal muscular atrophy is widely recognized as critical for improving neurologic and respiratory outcomes, especially in presymptomatic infants. With the expansion of newborn screening, more infants are now diagnosed presymptomatically. Currently, there are no established treatment guidelines for preterm infants with spinal muscular atrophy, with only anecdotal reports available. Additionally, there is limited knowledge regarding the safety and efficacy of the different treatments in preterm infants. In Israel, although a newborn screening program for spinal muscular atrophy is not yet implemented, a significant portion of the population participates in genetic carrier screening. Here, we present a case of presymptomatic preterm twins, born at gestational age of 32\u2009+\u20092 weeks, birth weights of 1855 and 1740 g, respectively. They were treated with risdiplam followed by onasemnogene abeparvovec at a gestational age of 35 and 43 weeks, respectively. This case adds to the limited data on treatment options for preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "Studies on cardiovascular changes after fetal growth restriction (FGR) are limited by their design in which growth-restricted neonates are compared to appropriately-grown neonates. We aim to investigate early structural cardiovascular remodeling after FGR in identical twins, controlling for confounding of genetic and maternal factors.\nThis study is part of a prospective cohort study including monochorionic twins from January 2019. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed within one week after birth. Z-scores for cardiac valve annuli diameters and left ventricle dimensions based on gestational age at birth were compared between smaller and larger twins. Z-score differences between birth weight and cardiac structure per twin were tested against the intercept.\nMedian gestational age at birth of the 100 included twin pairs was 33.8 (interquartile range (IQR) 30.8-36.1) weeks, with birth weights of 1729 (IQR 1200-2115) grams for smaller twins and 2058 (IQR 1643-2500) grams for larger twins. Smaller twins had a lower z-score for all structures. Z-score differences in birth weight and cardiac structure were higher than the intercept.\nWhile cardiac structures are generally smaller for the twin with the lower birth weight, the deviation in birth weight tends to be more pronounced than the deviation in cardiac structure.\nOur study shows that in identical twins, the smaller twin at birth has a structurally smaller heart on neonatal echocardiography when compared to the larger twin. Yet, cardiac structures per individual twin are less affected than body size for their given gestational age at birth. We have used a unique natural experiment by studying a population of identical twins with varying degrees of birth weight discordance, eliminating any confounding of genetic, maternal and obstetrical factors. Our results are suggestive of early cardiovascular remodeling after adverse intrauterine circumstances. This provides insight into the fetal programming of cardiovascular disease.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the concordance rates for LSS with DS requiring surgery by studying monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs.\nPatients between 18 and 85\u00a0years of age who underwent surgery for LSS with DS between 1996 and 2022 were identified in the national Swedish spine registry (14,614 patients) and matched with the Swedish Twin Registry to identify MZ and DZ twins. The concordance rates, the MZ/DZ concordance ratios, and the limits of genetic determination were calculated.\nWe identified 145 twin pairs (27 MZ and 118 DZ pairs) of whom 1 or both twins underwent surgery for LSS with DS. We found no concordant MZ pair and 2 concordant DZ pairs. When we evaluated pairs where at least one twin was operated for LSS with DS we found 2 concordant MZ pairs and 4 concordant DZ pairs (the co-twins were operated for LSS without DS) resulting in the probandwise concordance rate 0.14 (95% CI, 0 to 0.31) for MZ twins and 0.07 (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.13) for DZ twins. The probandwise MZ/DZ concordance ratio was 2.1 (95% CI 0-11.9). The limits of genetic determination were 0.27 to 0.36.\nOur findings suggest that heredity may not be of major etiologic importance in most cases of LSS with DS requiring surgery.",

    "abstract": "To investigate odds of vaginal delivery comparing induced versus spontaneous labor in nulliparas and multiparas with dichorionic twins.\nRetrospective review of dichorionic twin pregnancies from 2008-2021. Those with scheduled or elective cesarean, malpresentation, prior uterine surgery, fetal anomaly, gestational age (GA) at delivery < 34 weeks, and multifetal reduction were excluded. Nulliparas and multiparas were analyzed separately. The primary outcome was vaginal delivery of both twins. Secondary outcomes included preterm delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). Outcomes were compared among induced versus spontaneous labor and assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression.\nAmong 258 nulliparas, 176 (68.2%) were induced and 82 (31.8%) spontaneously labored. Induced patients were older (p=0.048), had higher proportion of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (IHCP) (p=0.04), HDP (p<0.0001) and later GA at delivery (p<0.0001). Patients who spontaneously labored had higher proportion of preterm delivery <37 (p<0.0001) and higher proportion of at least one twin admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (p=0.01). On univariable analysis, induction was associated with decreased likelihood of vaginal delivery of both twins (p=0.01). However, after adjusting for augmentation, GA at delivery, gestational diabetes, and HDP/chronic hypertension, this was no longer statistically significant (p=0.14). Among 239 multiparas, 108 (45.2%) were induced and 131 (54.8%) spontaneously labored. Induced patients had higher proportion IHCP (p=0.02), chronic hypertension (p=0.02), HDP (p<0.0001), and later GA at delivery (p<0.0001). Spontaneous labor patients had higher proportion of preterm delivery <37 (p<0.0001). There was no significant difference in odds of vaginal delivery between spontaneous versus induced labor on univariate (p=0.74) or adjusted analysis after controlling for augmentation, GA at delivery, gestational diabetes and HDP/chronic hypertension (p=0.40) among multiparas.\nAmong nulliparas and multiparas with dichorionic twins, induction of labor does not appear to be associated with decreased odds of vaginal delivery.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare microscopic placental characteristics between preterm twins and singletons, and between preterm monochorionic and dichorionic twins, in order to explore the effect of placental pathology on adverse neonatal outcomes.\nThis study included 566 neonates born \u226432 weeks and/or \u22641500\u00a0g, of whom 429 were singletons and 137 were twins (38 monochorionic and 99 dichorionic). Clinical data was retrospectively collected, and placentas were prospectively examined for maternal vascular malperfusion, fetal vascular malperfusion and placental inflammation (acute and chronic).\nSingletons had increased rates of maternal vascular malperfusion, fetal hypoxia, funisitis (in umbilical cord and chorial plate), chronic deciduitis, and villitis of unknown etiology compared to twins. Delayed villous maturation and ischemia were more frequently present in monochorionic placentas than in dichorionic. Singletons had a significant lower birthweight and were more often small for gestational age than twins. Multivariate linear regression analysis adjusting for singleton pregnancy, gestational hypertension and placental abnormalities showed that gestational hypertension (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-114.8), infarct (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-130.1), decidual necrosis (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-115.4), fetal hypoxia (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-59.3) and chronic deciduitis (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-118.8) were independently associated with lower birthweight. Multivariate regression analysis revealed five independent risk factors of small for gestational age: gestational hypertension (OR 4.4), infarct (OR 3.7), decidual necrosis (OR 2.7), fetal hypoxia (OR 1.9) and villitis (OR 5.2).\nSingleton pregnancies vary in histological placental abnormality rates from twin pregnancies. This study demonstrated that differences in birthweight and small for gestational age rates between preterm twins and singletons can be attributed to gestational hypertension and histological placental abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins (MZTs) share nearly identical genomic DNA sequences, making traditional forensic short tandem repeats (STR) genotyping methods ineffective for distinguishing between them. In recent years, the use of epigenetic factors in forensic applications has gained traction. The dynamic epigenetic factors can be influenced by inherited traits or acquired environmental factors. This study analyzed the expression profiles of transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) in peripheral blood from four pairs of adult MZTs using Panoramic RNA Display by Overcoming RNA Modification Aborted Sequencing (PANDORA-seq). Differentially expressed tsRNAs (DEtsRNAs) were identified and validated using the reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in both adult and newborn MZTs. The study also evaluated the longitudinal temporal stability, resistance to degradation, and suitability of DEtsRNAs for aged bloodstains. A total of 8795 expressed tsRNAs were identified in the four pairs of adult MZTs by PANDORA-seq. After screening with a normalized | log",

With the increasing complexity of omics data, particularly multiomics, there is a growing need for advanced computational frameworks to interpret these data effectively. Foundation models (FMs), large-scale machine learning models pretrained on diverse data types, have recently emerged as powerful tools for improving data interpretability and decision-making in precision medicine. This review discusses the integration of FMs into MDT systems, particularly their role in enhancing the interpretability of multiomics data. We examine current challenges, recent advancements, and future opportunities in leveraging FMs for multiomics analysis in MDTs, with a focus on their application in precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular digital twins and mechanistic models can be used to obtain new biomarkers from patient-specific hemodynamic data. However, such model-derived biomarkers are only clinically relevant if the uncertainty of the biomarkers is smaller than the variation between timepoints/patients. Unfortunately, this uncertainty is challenging to calculate, as the uncertainty of the underlying hemodynamic data is largely unknown and has several sources that are not additive or normally distributed. This violates normality assumptions of current methods; implying that also biomarkers have an unknown uncertainty. To remedy these problems, we herein present a method, with attached code, for uncertainty calculation of model-derived biomarkers using non-normal data. First, we estimated all sources of uncertainty, both normal and non-normal, in hemodynamic data used to personalize an existing model; the errors in 4D flow MRI-derived stroke volumes were 5-20\u00a0% and the blood pressure errors were 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0mmHg. Second, we estimated the resulting model-derived biomarker uncertainty for 100 simulated datasets, sampled from the data distributions, by: 1) combining data uncertainties 2) parameter estimation, 3) profile-likelihood. The true biomarker values were found within a 95\u00a0% confidence interval in 98\u00a0% (median) of the cases. This shows both that our estimated data uncertainty is reasonable, and that we can use profile-likelihood despite the non-normality. Finally, we demonstrated that e.g. ventricular relaxation rate has a smaller uncertainty (\u223c10\u00a0%) than the variation across a clinical cohort (\u223c40\u00a0%), meaning that these biomarkers have clinical potential. Our results take us one step closer to the usage of model-derived biomarkers for cardiovascular patient characterization.",

A thorough multidisciplinary work-up, including surgical specialties, nursing, anesthesia, and critical care, must be performed prior to proceeding with surgical separation.

    "abstract": "22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations, posing a diagnostic challenge. When cardinal characteristics, such as conotruncal cardiac anomalies or immunodeficiency, are absent, genetic testing may be delayed, postponing interventions to minimise developmental delay. We present a case of monochorionic monoamniotic identical twins diagnosed with de novo 22q11.2DS around 3\u2009months of life, who lacked major characteristics of the disease. Both infants were admitted and discharged multiple times with consistent concerns for failure to thrive (FTT) and aspiration. Twin B was incidentally found to have asymptomatic hypocalcaemia and hypoparathyroidism, leading to a 22q11.2DS diagnosis. Twin A had no symptoms other than FTT and aspiration. This case encourages considering 22q11.2DS in the differential diagnosis for FTT, even when classic symptoms are absent or delayed in presentation. Early recognition allows for timely intervention and better outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated whether having a familial risk of affective disorders, subclinical psychopathology, functioning, personality traits, stressful life events, and childhood trauma predict the onset or recurrence of affective episodes.\nThe present study is a 7-year follow-up study of a baseline sample of 204 monozygotic twins (MZ) with unipolar or bipolar disorder in remission or partial remission (affected), their unaffected co-twins (high-risk), and healthy twins with no personal or familial history of affective disorder (low-risk).\nDuring the 7.0-year median follow-up time, 59.3\u202f% of the affected twins had a recurrence of an affective episode, 33.3\u202f% of high-risk twins, and 7.5\u202f% of low-risk twins had an onset. Familial risk and being affected were predictors for onset and recurrence. Including the whole sample, subclinical symptoms, functioning, stressful life events, and the personality trait neuroticism were statistically significant predictors of onset and recurrence. Regarding the individual risk groups, increasing age was a significant predictor of increased hazard in the affected risk group and lower hazard in the low-risk group.\nThis follow-up study revealed that the most potent predictors for onset or recurrence were familial risk and having an affective disorder at baseline. Subclinical depressive symptoms, personality traits, stressful life events, and impaired functioning were significant contributors to onset risk and recurrence.

    "abstract": "Enterovirus is a well-known cause of infection in all age groups, with particular importance for neonates with both vertically and horizontally transmission. Neonatal clinical manifestations are highly variable and mostly is asymptomatic, but severe infections are described such as myocarditis, meningitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, coagulopathy, pneumonia and viral sepsis. Since 2022, The World Health Organization has recently reported an increasing number of severe neonatal infection associated with a new variant of Echovirus-11 (E-11). Many of the infants described with E-11 infections in a case reports series were preterm, male and twins. Despite the criticality of neonatal disease, the clinical management remains primarily supportive and therapeutic options are unfortunately few.\nWe present the case of male dichorionic diamniotic late-preterm twins, born in December 2023 at Filippo del Ponte Hospital in Varese (Northen Italy) with early Echovirus-11 infection. They had two dramatically different clinical scenarios and one of them developed a severe and fatal hemorrhage-hepatitis syndrome.\nOur experience has the purpose to emphasize public health attention to Echovirus-11 neonatal infections and their rare dramatically neonatal clinical presentations. Prematurity, host genetic predisposition and vertical transmission seem to be strong risk factors for severe infections, but it still need to be elucidated. According to previous Italian report, a surveillance protocols in all cases with unexpected clinical presentations and sequencing complete genome in order to better understand typing and molecular characterization of emerging and re-emerging pathogenic variants and new strains are strongly recommend in Italy.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy among women. Among 5%-10% of diagnoses are correlated with hereditary cancer syndromes, while the remaining cases are sporadic and linked to multiple factors. When a pathogenetic variant in one of the genes commonly associated with BC is detected, the patient is referred to a tailored surveillance program; otherwise, the standard follow-up guidelines are applied. We present a unique case of BC diagnosed in two monozygotic twins at the same age apparently unrelated to a hereditary syndrome known to date. Notably, despite comparable clinical-pathological features, the two neoplasms behaved differently to neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy, showing different outcomes and toxicities. Very little is known about the predictive mechanisms of response and toxicity to immunotherapy and this clinical case might be a starting point for further investigations.",

    "abstract": "Understanding of twin growth in the United States (US) is based on outdated or predominantly non-Hispanic White samples, and the age at which twins catch up to singletons is unclear. In this study, we characterized normative weight trajectories of twins and singletons in a contemporary, diverse cohort.\nData were from the PROMISE study, an electronic health record-based cohort of pregnant people and their children in the US (2005-2021). The Jenss model was used to characterize weight trajectories from 0 to 24\u00a0months of age. Twins (\nMale and female twins had lower birth weight compared to singletons and experienced a high rate of weight gain throughout infancy. Among males, twins caught up in weight to the full singleton cohort and to GA-matched singletons at approximately 12 and 6\u00a0months, respectively. Among females, twins caught up to GA-matched singletons at approximately 15\u00a0months but did not fully overcome their birth weight disadvantage to the full singleton sample by 24\u00a0months.\nThese findings highlight that the use of singleton growth charts or preterm singleton growth charts among twins may be inappropriate and suggest the need for a twin-specific growth chart. Future research is needed to understand factors that drive differences in weight trajectories between twins and singletons and to guide twin-specific guidelines.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective study compared the speech-language development of a pair of dizygotic twin girls during the first 2 years of life: one with typical development (Twin A) and one with atypical development (Twin B), who was later diagnosed with Rett syndrome (RTT). Audio snippets were extracted from home videos, with nearly equal representation from each child. The audio analysis focused on articulatory complexity, voice characteristics, and linguistic variability. Despite sharing the same social-communicative environment, the twins' speech-language development diverged. From the first to second year of life, articulatory complexity and variability increased in the typically developing Twin A. In contrast, Twin B produced a high number of vocalizations in the 7th month, including canonical sounds with substantial variability. However, her vocalization quantity, complexity, and variability subsequently decreased, resulting in only sporadically discernable canonical vocalizations during her second year. This developmental trajectory points to very early stagnation and regression in Twin B, occurring earlier than typically observed. While Twin B displayed a range of typical vocalization features, deviations in the density and distribution of inspiratory and high-pitched vocalizations during the first year further suggest early speech-language abnormalities in RTT, preceding frank developmental stagnation and regression. As the study relied on limited retrospective data, the findings should be interpreted with caution, and further investigation is needed. Nevertheless, this twin study provides a unique perspective that deepens our understanding of early speech-language developmental profiles in RTT, especially in light of the intertwinement of genetic, individual, and contextual factors.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is the most frequent health-related condition worldwide and is a primary risk factor for renal and cardiovascular diseases. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. To uncover these mechanisms, multi-omics studies have significant potential, but such studies are challenged by genetic and environmental confounding - an issue that can be effectively reduced by studying intra-pair differences in twins. Here, we coupled data on hypertension diagnoses from the nationwide Danish Patient Registry to a study population of 740 twins for whom genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression data were available together with measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. We investigated five phenotypes: incident hypertension cases, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, hypertension (140/90\u2009mmHg), and hypertension (130/80\u2009mmHg). Statistical analyses were performed using Cox (incident cases) or linear (remaining) regression analyses at both the individual-level and twin pair-level. Significant genes (p\u2009<\u20090.05) at both levels and in both types of biological data were investigated by bioinformatic analyses, including gene set enrichment analysis and interaction network analysis. Overall, most of the identified pathways related to the immune system, particularly inflammation, and biology of vascular smooth muscle cell. Of specific genes, lysine methyltransferase 2\u2009A (KMT2A) was found to be central for incident hypertension, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) for systolic blood pressure, and beta-actin (ACTB) for diastolic blood pressure. Noteworthy, lysine methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A) was also identified in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure analyses. Here, we present novel biomarkers for hypertension. This study design is surprisingly rare in the field of hypertension. We identified biological pathways related to vascular smooth muscle cells and the immune system, particular inflammation, to be associated with hypertension and blood pressure. Of specific genes, we identified KMT2A (lysine methyltransferase 2A) to be central for blood pressure and hypertension development.

    "abstract": "Digital twins (DTs) are digital representations of real-world systems, enabling advanced simulations, predictive modeling, and real-time optimization in various fields, including health care. Despite growing interest, the integration of DTs in health care faces challenges such as fragmented applications, ethical concerns, and barriers to adoption.\nThis study systematically reviews the existing literature on DT applications in health care with three objectives: (1) to map primary applications, (2) to identify key challenges and limitations, and (3) to highlight gaps that can guide future research.\nA meta-review was conducted in a systematic fashion, adhering to PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, and included 25 literature reviews published between 2021 and 2024. The search encompassed 5 databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Embase, and PsycINFO. Thematic synthesis was used to categorize DT applications, stakeholders, and barriers to adoption.\nA total of 3 primary DT applications in health care were identified: personalized medicine, operational efficiency, and medical research. While current applications, such as predictive diagnostics, patient-specific treatment simulations, and hospital resource optimization, remain in their early stages of development, they highlight the significant potential of DTs. Challenges include data quality, ethical issues, and socioeconomic barriers. This review also identified gaps in scalability, interoperability, and clinical validation.\nDTs hold transformative potential in health care, providing individualized care, operational optimization, and accelerated research. However, their adoption is hindered by technical, ethical, and financial barriers. Addressing these issues requires interdisciplinary collaboration, standardized protocols, and inclusive implementation strategies to ensure equitable access and meaningful impact.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a highly heterogeneous condition, and current methods struggle to synthesize extensive clinical data for personalized care. Using data from 343 HF patients, we developed mechanistic computational models of the cardiovascular system to create digital twins. These twins, consisting of optimized measurable and unmeasurable parameters alongside simulations of cardiovascular function, provided comprehensive representations of individual disease states. Unsupervised machine learning applied to digital twin-derived features identified interpretable phenogroups and mechanistic drivers of cardiovascular death risk. Incorporating these features into prognostic AI models improved performance, transferability, and interpretability compared to models using only clinical variables. This framework demonstrates potential to enhance prognosis and guide therapy, paving the way for more precise, individualized HF management.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a complex developmental disorder whose molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. The developmental course of schizophrenia can be modeled with human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) -derived brain cells that carry patient-specific genetic risk factors for the disorder. Although transcriptomic characterization of the patient-derived cells is a standard procedure, microRNA (miRNA) profiling is less frequently performed. To investigate the role of miRNAs in transcriptomic regulation in schizophrenia, we performed miRNA sequencing for hiPSC-derived neurons from five monozygotic twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia and six controls (CTR). We compared the miRNA expression to differentially expressed genes (DEGs) reported for the same cells in our earlier work. We found 21 DEmiRNAs between the affected twins (AT) and CTR with implications for the regulation of neuronal function. In addition, a separate analysis of three AT with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), their unaffected twins (UT), and CTR revealed an upregulation of four miRNAs in the UT compared to both AT and CTR. The DEmiRNAs found between the UT and CTR were associated with increased cAMP/PKA signaling and synaptogenesis signaling in the UT. We hypothesize that the upregulation of these processes in the UT could be linked to compensatory features against schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents significant challenges in drug discovery and development due to its complex and poorly understood pathology and etiology. Digital twins (DTs) are recently developed virtual real-time representations of physical entities that enable rapid assessment of the bidirectional interaction between the virtual and physical domains. With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the growing accumulation of multi-omics and clinical data, application of DTs in healthcare is gaining traction. Digital twin technology, in the form of multiscale virtual models of patients or organ systems, can track health status in real time with continuous feedback, thereby driving model updates that enhance clinical decision-making. Here, we posit an additional role for DTs in drug discovery, with particular utility for complex diseases like AD. In this review, we discuss salient challenges in AD drug development, including complex disease pathology and comorbidities, difficulty in early diagnosis, and the current high failure rate of clinical trials. We also review DTs and discuss potential applications for predicting AD progression, discovering biomarkers, identifying new drug targets and opportunities for drug repurposing, facilitating clinical trials, and advancing precision medicine. Despite significant hurdles in this area, such as integration and standardization of dynamic medical data and issues of data security and privacy, DTs represent a promising approach for revolutionizing drug discovery in AD.",

    "abstract": "Genetic factors are considered important in the development of degenerative spine disease. The aim of this study was to determine the twin concordance rates for the common cervical spine diseases cervical disk herniation (CDH), cervical foraminal stenosis (CFS), and degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) requiring surgical treatment by studying monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs.\nPatients, aged 18-85 years, operated for CDH, CFS, or DCM between 1996 and 2022 were identified in the national Swedish spine register (5962 CDH, 3801 CFS, and 3131 DCM) and matched with the Swedish twin registry to identify MZ and DZ twins. Concordance rates were calculated.\nThere were 64 twin pairs where one or both twins had surgical treatment for CDH. The corresponding numbers for surgically treated CFS and DCM were 37 twin pairs and 44 twin pairs respectively. For twins with CDH we found one concordant MZ pair and no concordant DZ pair (MZ probandwise concordance rate 0.12 [95% CI 0-0.33]). For twins with CFS we found one concordant MZ pair and no concordant DZ pair (MZ probandwise concordance rate 0.14 [95% CI 0-0.38]). In DCM patients we found no concordant twin pair.\nIn this national observational study, including 145 twin pairs, the concordance rates were low for surgically treated CDH, CFS, and DCM conditions. Our findings suggest that not only genetic factors, but also environmental factors and personal preferences are important whether a patient goes to surgery for this type of condition.",

    "abstract": "The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report on December 15, 2023, \"Foundational Research Gaps and Future Directions for Digital Twins.\" This described the importance of using biomimetic digital twins and multiomics in research. We incorporated these in our analysis of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We performed exome sequencing, genotype-phenotype ranking, and biomimetic digital twin analysis. We identified five pathogenic and one likely pathogenic DNA variants in patient samples analyzed but absent from controls. The variants identified in these genes, P2RX7, HTRA2, PTPN22, FLG, CD46, and EIF4G1, play a role in the development of RA. We also identified 3172 variants of unknown clinical significance (VUSs) in patient samples, absent from controls. All VUSs appeared to be associated with RA. We identified hidden or dark data from six genes. The genes, often found in patient samples, included genes HIF1A, HLA-DOA, PTGER3, HIPK3, TGFBR3, and HIF1A-AS3. VUSs identified in genes HIF1A, HLA-DOA, PTGER3, and HIPK3 are directly related to the pathogenesis of RA, whereas VUSs identified in genes TGFBR3 and HIF1A-AS3 are indirectly related. Our results suggest that by using biomimetic digital twins and multiomics, we can gain more insight into the development of RA. We can also potentially begin the process of reclassifying VUSs. The reclassification of VUSs will play a critical role in complex molecular diagnostics and drug development.",

    "abstract": "Many post-authorization safety studies focus on congenital malformations and rely on diagnosis codes found in US data sources. However, no authoritative standards exist for identifying and classifying malformations in these data. To address this, we translated an existing public health surveillance guide, the European Concerted Action on Congenital Anomalies and Twins (EUROCAT), into an ICD-10-CM code list for use in studies using US administrative healthcare data. The EUROCAT guide was selected for its decisive major or minor classification of each code. However, translation was required for use in US data sources since EUROCAT utilizes ICD-10-BPA which differs from ICD-10-CM (the coding system commonly encountered in US data sources).\nWe mapped EUROCAT to ICD-10-CM. For each code, manual review was conducted by two or more researchers, and major/minor classification was based on code descriptions since some codes differed between coding systems.\nA final code list was created, containing 916 ICD-10-CM codes for 744 major and 172 minor malformations. The code list contains ICD-10-CM codes, their corresponding descriptions, their major or minor classification and disease category according to EUROCAT, and variables indicating anomalies caused by genetic or infectious diseases unlikely attributable to a medication.\nWe adapted the EUROCAT Guide 1.5 into an ICD-10-CM code list for use in pregnancy studies using US data sources. This list includes new ICD-10-CM codes available in 2024. As new ICD-10-CM codes become available, or as the EUROCAT Guide is updated, further updates to this list will be needed.",

    "abstract": "In preterm infants, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most devastating complications seen in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), with both short- and long-term sequelae. Outcomes reported for mono- (versus di-) chorionic twins suggest an increased incidence in the monochorionic twins, usually attributed to abnormal placental vascular connections. Same sex concordance and zygosity data suggest shared genetic and environmental factors as important contributing factors to the pathogenesis of NEC. This concept is further supported by fecal microbiome data from preterm twins. However, there is also some uncertainty in these observations because studies that controlled for gestational age did not show significant differences between singletons and twins in the occurrence of NEC. This mini-review was undertaken as a critical appraisal of the published literature in terms of twin studies to establish the genetic relevance vis-\u00e0vis NEC. There is a need for further evaluation of genetic and confounding factors arising from the environment and the gut microbiome in these infants using cohorts with larger sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "A key component in developing atrial digital twins (ADT) - virtual representations of patients' atria - is the accurate prescription of myocardial fibers which are essential for the tissue characterization. Due to the difficulty of reconstructing atrial fibers from medical imaging, a widely used strategy for fiber generation in ADT relies on mathematical models. Existing methodologies utilize semi-automatic approaches, are tailored to specific morphologies, and lack rigorous validation against imaging fiber data. In this study, we introduce a novel atrial Laplace-Dirichlet-Rule-Based Method (LDRBM) for prescribing highly detailed myofiber orientations and providing robust regional annotation in bi-atrial morphologies of any complexity. The robustness of our approach is verified in eight extremely detailed bi-atrial geometries, derived from a sub-millimeter Diffusion-Tensor-Magnetic-Resonance Imaging (DTMRI) human atrial fiber dataset. We validate the LDRBM by quantitatively recreating each of the DTMRI fiber architectures: a comprehensive comparison with DTMRI ground truth data is conducted, investigating differences between electrophysiology (EP) simulations provided by either LDRBM and DTMRI fibers. Finally, we demonstrate that the novel LDRBM outperforms current state-of-the-art (LDRBMs and Universal Atrial Coordinates) fiber models, confirming the exceptional accuracy of our methodology and the critical importance of incorporating detailed fiber orientations in EP simulations. Ultimately, this work represents a fundamental step towards the development of physics-based digital twins of the human atria, establishing a new standard for prescribing fibers in ADT.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the ethical controversies surrounding separation surgery of conjoined twins by examining the discussions in the relevant published literature. A critical review was conducted to study the ethical issues involved in the separation surgery of conjoined twins. A literature search on PubMed and Embase was performed on December 4, 2023, using the terms \"ethics\", \"conjoined twins\", and \"separation\". Relevant papers published in the last 10 years (2013-2023) were included. A total of seven papers were included: two were case reports and five were expert statements or opinions. The four pillars of ethics (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice) were a common approach adopted by most authors to analyse the ethical issues in the separation surgery of conjoined twins. Due to the need to consider the perspectives of two patients simultaneously, opposing arguments were common depending on the approach taken, especially when analysing the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence. All papers examined the possible difficulties in autonomy, with some exploring consent, specifically around decision-making. It was largely agreed that the parents should be the decision-makers due to the patients' lack of capacity, except in non-urgent situations, where patients should be given the opportunity to make their own decisions. Achieving equality in the distribution of shared organs and survival opportunities proved challenging. Other ethical principles were also discussed, such as the act-omission and double effect doctrines. Limitations of this paper included the limited geographical coverage of the studies, as well as the potential to miss relevant studies, including those conducted beyond the search period, those published in other languages, and those unpublished. From the overall results, there is no apparent definite answer as to whether separation surgery is justified. Due to every patient and situation being unique, the best approach should be decided on a case-by-case basis, guided by the four pillars of ethics, and with the involvement of families and ethical committees. Both the ethical considerations and other factors should be taken into account.",

    "abstract": "A conjoined parasitic twin is a grossly defective fetus or fetal parts attached externally to a relatively normal twin. Rachipagus conjoined twins are fused at the spine. Conjoined twinning is an exceedingly uncommon congenital abnormality, with rachipagus twinning being the rarest variant.\nThe authors report the case of a rare parasitic rachipagus conjoined twin who was surgically managed at 9 weeks of age. The patient presented with skin-covered swelling on her upper back that resembled digits. Further study with computed tomography showed parasitic content of the digits and embryonic tissue and the absence of posterior elements of the T4 and T5 vertebrae without meningocele at the autosite. The patient underwent successful excision of the parasitic twin and subsequently had normal growth and development.\nNeural tube defects of varying degrees occur in almost all rachipagus parasites, which should be taken into account in the comprehensive treatment of the pathology. Patients vary in the degree of fusion, and preoperative imaging to demonstrate the complex surgical anatomy at the fusion site should be an integral part of treatment. A multidisciplinary team consisting of neurosurgeons, pediatric surgeons, and plastic surgeons is required. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24698.",

    "abstract": "Preemptive medicine represents a paradigm shift from reactive treatment to proactive disease prevention. The integration of omics technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) has facilitated the development of personalized, predictive, and preemptive healthcare strategies. Omic technologies, such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, provide comprehensive insights into molecular profile of an individual, revealing potential disease predispositions and health trajectories. IoT devices, such as wearables and smartphones, enable continuous and periodic monitoring of physiological parameters, thus providing a dynamic view of an individual's health status. AI algorithms analyze comprehensive and complex data from omics and IoT technologies to identify patterns and correlations that inform predictive models of disease risk, progression, and response to interventions. Medical digital twins, or virtual replicas of an individual's biological processes, have emerged as the cornerstone of preemptive medicine. The integration of omics, IoT, and AI enables the development of medical digital twins, which in turn allows for precise simulation of human physiological profiles, prediction of future health outcomes, and virtual individual clinical trials, facilitating personalized proactive interventions and preemptive disease control. This review demonstrates the convergence of omics, IoT, and AI in preemptive medicine, highlighting their potential to revolutionize healthcare by enabling early disease detection, personalized treatment strategies, and chronic disease prevention. We show how AI leverages omics and IoT in preemptive medicine through several case studies while also discussing the necessary data for developing medical digital twins and addressing ethical and social aspects that warrant consideration. Medical digital twins signify a fundamental transformation in health management, shifting from treating diseases after their occurrence to controlling them before their occurrence. This approach enhances the effectiveness of medical interventions and improves overall health outcomes, preparing for a healthier future.",

    "abstract": "To investigate changes in N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in the amniotic fluid of recipient twins with twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), analyze the correlation between NT-proBNP and cardiac linear measurements, and assess the feasibility of NT-proBNP as a biochemical marker for fetal cardiac function.\nA total of 47 pregnancies with TTTS, 21 idiopathic polyhydramnios pregnancies, and 114 normal singleton pregnancies were included from Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between October 2020 and July 2023. Fetal cardiac linear parameters, amniotic fluid depth, and NT-proBNP levels in amniotic fluid were measured across the three groups. The correlation of NT-proBNP with amniotic fluid depth, cardiac linear parameters, and CHOP score in TTTS recipients was analyzed.\nThere was no statistically significant difference in amniotic fluid NT-proBNP levels and cardiac linear parameters between idiopathic polyhydramnios and normal singletons. However, NT-proBNP levels and cardiac parameters in TTTS recipient twins were significantly higher than in the other two groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). After adjusting for gestational variables, NT-proBNP levels in TTTS recipients showed significant correlations with atrial and ventricular diameters, ventricular wall thickness, cardiothoracic ratio, and CHOP score.\nAmniotic fluid NT-proBNP is a sensitive and objective biochemical marker for assessing fetal cardiac function, independent of amniotic fluid volume. It serves as a valuable complement to echocardiographic assessment in evaluating the severity of fetal heart failure in TTTS recipients.",

    "abstract": "Ineffective medication is a major healthcare problem causing significant patient suffering and economic costs. This issue stems from the complex nature of diseases, which involve altered interactions among thousands of genes across multiple cell types and organs. Disease progression can vary between patients and over time, influenced by genetic and environmental factors. To address this challenge, digital twins have emerged as a promising approach, which have led to international initiatives aiming at clinical implementations. Digital twins are virtual representations of health and disease processes that can integrate real-time data and simulations to predict, prevent, and personalize treatments. Early clinical applications of DTs have shown potential in areas like artificial organs, cancer, cardiology, and hospital workflow optimization. However, widespread implementation faces several challenges: (1) characterizing dynamic molecular changes across multiple biological scales; (2) developing computational methods to integrate data into DTs; (3) prioritizing disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets; (4) creating interoperable DT systems that can learn from each other; (5) designing user-friendly interfaces for patients and clinicians; (6) scaling DT technology globally for equitable healthcare access; (7) addressing ethical, regulatory, and financial considerations. Overcoming these hurdles could pave the way for more predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine, potentially transforming healthcare delivery and improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Genetically informative twin studies have consistently found that individual differences in anxiety and depression symptoms are stable and primarily attributable to time-invariant genetic influences, with non-shared environmental influences accounting for transient effects.\nWe explored the etiology of psychological and somatic distress in 2279 Australian twins assessed up to six times between ages 12-35. We evaluated autoregressive, latent growth, dual-change, common, and independent pathway models to identify which, if any, best describes the observed longitudinal covariance and accounts for genetic and environmental influences over time.\nAn autoregression model best explained both psychological and somatic distress. Familial aggregation was entirely explained by additive genetic influences, which were largely stable from ages 12 to 35. However, small but significant age-dependent genetic influences were observed at ages 20-27 and 32-35 for psychological distress and at ages 16-19 and 24-27 for somatic distress. In contrast, environmental influences were predominantly transient and age-specific.\nThe longitudinal trajectory of psychological distress from ages 12 to 35 can thus be largely explained by forward transmission of a stable additive genetic influence, alongside smaller age-specific genetic innovations. This study addresses the limitation of previous research by exhaustively exploring alternative theoretical explanations for the observed patterns in distress symptoms over time, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic and environmental factors influencing psychological and somatic distress across this age range.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions is critical for advancing drug discovery. By reducing time and cost, machine learning and deep learning can accelerate this laborious discovery process. In a novel approach, BarlowDTI, we utilise the powerful Barlow Twins architecture for feature-extraction while considering the structure of the target protein. Our method achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance against multiple established benchmarks using only one-dimensional input. The use of our hybrid approach of deep learning and gradient boosting machine as the underlying predictor ensures fast and efficient predictions without the need for substantial computational resources. We also propose the use of an influence method to investigate how the model reaches its decision based on individual training samples. By comparing co-crystal structures, we find that BarlowDTI\u00a0effectively exploits catalytically active and stabilising residues, highlighting the model's ability to generalise from one-dimensional input data. In addition, we further benchmark new baselines against existing methods. Together, these innovations improve the efficiency and effectiveness of drug-target interactions predictions, providing robust tools for accelerating drug development and deepening the understanding of molecular interactions. Therefore, we provide an easy-to-use web interface that can be freely accessed at https://www.bio.nat.tum.de/oc2/barlowdti . SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: Our computationally efficient and effective hybrid approach, combining the deep learning model Barlow Twins and gradient boosting machines, outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple splits and benchmarks using only one-dimensional input. Furthermore, we advance the field by proposing an influence method that elucidates model decision-making, thereby providing deeper insights into molecular interactions and improving the interpretability of drug-target interactions predictions.",

    "abstract": "Many species of fish, birds and mammals commonly live in human captivity; Atlantic salmon Salmo salar is one of them. The international legal status of the welfare of captive animals is slowly developing and still requires rigorous specification. For example, even though fish have complex cognition and elements of sentience, The United Nations' animal welfare principles still take a functional health-centred perspective overlooking the cognitive-affective component. Wellbeing problems remain a major source of slow growth and high mortality in intensive aquaculture of Atlantic salmon. The value system for decision making in vertebrates is based on expectations of emotional wellbeing for the options available and is linked with the individual's assessment of its future. We propose a new approach for monitoring and improving the welfare of salmon (or any other captive or wild vertebrate) based on modelling the salmon's wellbeing system by digital twins, which are simulation models that implement major bodily mechanisms of the organism. Indeed, predictions on boredom, stress and wellbeing can all be captured by a computational evolutionary model of the factors underlying behaviour. We explain how such an agent-based model of salmon digital twins can be constructed by modelling a salmon's subjective wellbeing experience along with prediction of its near future and allostasis (the bodily preparation for the expected near future). We attempt to identify the building blocks required in digital twin models to deliver early warnings about escalating issues that could eventually lead to negative effects on salmon health in aquaculture. These models would provide critical insights for optimizing production processes and could significantly reduce the reliance on animal experiments. Overall, reports of a population of digital twins could support the implementation of 3Rs - replacement, reduction, refinement - by offering actionable information to fish farmers as well as consumers, voters, politicians and regulators on relevant issues as well as guide experimental work on animal wellbeing across species.",

    "abstract": "While prepregnancy overweight or obesity is known to negatively impact maternal health, its effect on twin infants is not well understood. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide, multicenter retrospective study to investigate the association between maternal prepregnancy weight and health outcomes in twins.\nThis study collected data from 22 healthcare units across 12 regions in China between January 2018 and December 2020. To control for confounding factors, multiple logistic regression, propensity score matching (PSM), inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), and overlapping weighting models (OW) were applied to explore the effects of prepregnancy BMI on Apgar scores and other outcomes.\nAfter screening, a total of 4,724 women with twin pregnancies and 9,448 newborns were included in the study. Compared to normal prepregnancy weight, prepregnancy overweight/obesity significantly increased the risk of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes in mothers [adjusted OR (95% CI): 1.85 (1.55-2.21) and 1.49 (1.27-1.74), respectively]. It also increased the incidence of twins with a 1-min Apgar score \u22647, whether they were larger or smaller [1.60 (1.20-2.13) and 1.45 (1.09-1.92), respectively]. Sensitivity analyses using PSM [1.60 (1.20-2.13) and 1.55 (1.07-2.25)], IPTW [1.67 (1.31-2.12) and 1.48 (1.17-1.87)], and OW [1.65 (1.08-2.57) and 1.47 (0.97-2.25)] confirmed the stability of these results. However, it did not affect the likelihood of a 5-min Apgar score \u22647 [adjusted OR (95% CI): 0.82 (0.24-2.17) and 1.40 (0.70-2.73)]. In contrast, prepregnancy underweight was associated with a reduced incidence of twins with a 1-min Apgar score \u22647 [adjusted OR (95% CI): 0.56 (0.32-0.92) and 0.58 (0.34-0.94)], but had no effect on the 5-min Apgar score \u22647 [adjusted OR (95% CI): 0.82 (0.24-2.17) and 0.22 (0.01-1.08)]. Prepregnancy BMI did not significantly affect twin birth weight discordance, NICU admission, preterm birth, or low birth weight.\nMaternal overweight/obesity before pregnancy increases the risk of hypertensive disorders and gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies and significantly raises the likelihood of twins having a low 1-min Apgar score. However, no significant impact on 5-min Apgar scores was observed.

    "results": "After screening, a total of 4,724 women with twin pregnancies and 9,448 newborns were included in the study. Compared to normal prepregnancy weight, prepregnancy overweight/obesity significantly increased the risk of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes in mothers [adjusted OR (95% CI): 1.85 (1.55-2.21) and 1.49 (1.27-1.74), respectively]. It also increased the incidence of twins with a 1-min Apgar score \u22647, whether they were larger or smaller [1.60 (1.20-2.13) and 1.45 (1.09-1.92), respectively]. Sensitivity analyses using PSM [1.60 (1.20-2.13) and 1.55 (1.07-2.25)], IPTW [1.67 (1.31-2.12) and 1.48 (1.17-1.87)], and OW [1.65 (1.08-2.57) and 1.47 (0.97-2.25)] confirmed the stability of these results. However, it did not affect the likelihood of a 5-min Apgar score \u22647 [adjusted OR (95% CI): 0.82 (0.24-2.17) and 1.40 (0.70-2.73)]. In contrast, prepregnancy underweight was associated with a reduced incidence of twins with a 1-min Apgar score \u22647 [adjusted OR (95% CI): 0.56 (0.32-0.92) and 0.58 (0.34-0.94)], but had no effect on the 5-min Apgar score \u22647 [adjusted OR (95% CI): 0.82 (0.24-2.17) and 0.22 (0.01-1.08)]. Prepregnancy BMI did not significantly affect twin birth weight discordance, NICU admission, preterm birth, or low birth weight.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of perinatal studies is complicated by twins and other multiple births even when multiples are not the exposure, outcome, or a confounder of interest. In analyses of infant outcomes restricted to live births, common approaches to handling multiples include restriction to singletons, counting outcomes at the pregnancy level (i.e., by counting if at least one twin experienced a binary outcome), or infant-level analysis including all infants and accounting for clustering of outcomes, such as by using generalized estimating equations or mixed effects models. Several healthcare administration databases only support restriction to singletons or pregnancy-level approaches. For example, in MarketScan insurance claims data, diagnoses in twins are often assigned to a single infant identifier, thereby preventing ascertainment of infant-level outcomes among multiples. Different approaches correspond to different questions, produce different estimands, and often rely on different assumptions. We demonstrate the differences that can arise from these different approaches using Monte Carlo simulations, algebraic formulas, and an applied example.",

    "abstract": "The personal identification of monozygotic (MZ) twins is of great importance in forensic medicine. Due to the extreme similarity in genetic between MZ twins, it is challenging to differentiate them using autosomal STR genotyping. Forensic experts are striving to explore available genetic markers that can differentiate between MZ twins. With the advent of next-generation sequence (NGS), an increasing number of genetic markers have been demonstrated to effectively differentiate between MZ twins. Here, we summarized for the relevant studies on MZ twins' differentiation and discussed the limitations of the underlying markers. In details, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variation (CNV), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), DNA methylation, and non-coding RNA have been demonstrated considerable value. Furthermore, the utilization of proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics has shed light on MZ twin differentiation. Additionally, we introduce the methodologies for MZ differentiation based on external morphological variations observed in the human body. Looking to the future, the process of aging may represent a novel avenue for the differentiation of MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "It is challenging to distinguish monozygotic (MZ) twins using traditional autosomal STR genotyping due to their nearly identical genomes. As an important kind of small non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) are essential regulators of gene expression and considered as excellent biomarkers due to their resistance to degradation. Moreover, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has emerged as a powerful technique for detecting gene mutations and pathogenic microorganisms, owing to its sensitivity and reliability. We aimed to explore the differential expression of miRNAs between MZ twins using next-sequence platform and assess the reliability of differentially expressed miRNAs by ddPCR. MiRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) revealed nine differentially expressed miRNAs shared across five pairs of twins, including hsa-miR-3620-3p, hsa-miR-6825-5p, hsa-miR-1273h-5p, hsa-miR-200a-5p, hsa-miR-3192-5p, hsa-miR-188-5p, hsa-miR-206, hsa-miR-4796-5p, and hsa-miR-6775-3p. Subsequently, the combination of real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and ddPCR confirmed the ability of five of these miRNAs (hsa-miR-1273h-5p, hsa-miR-3192-5p, hsa-miR-188-5p, hsa-miR-206, and hsa-miR-6775-3p) in distinguishing monozygotic twins. Furthermore, ddPCR demonstrated superior recognition accuracy compared to qPCR. Finally, we evaluated the degradation resistance of these five miRNAs under different environmental conditions. None of the five miRNAs showed a significant decrease in expression levels after being stored at room temperature for up to 180 days or undergoing 10 freeze-thaw cycles. In summary, our study revealed the potential application of miRNAs in differentiation of MZ twins and the powerful role of ddPCR in forensic medicine.",

    "abstract": "Precision medicine involves a paradigm shift toward personalized data-driven clinical decisions. The concept of a medical \"digital twin\" has recently become popular to designate digital representations of patients as a support for a wide range of data science applications. However, the concept is ambiguous when it comes to practical implementations. Here, we propose a medical digital twin framework with a data-centric approach. We argue that a single digital representation of patients cannot support all the data uses of digital twins for technical and regulatory reasons. Instead, we propose a data architecture leveraging three main families of digital representations: (1) multimodal dashboards integrating various raw health records at points of care to assist with perception and documentation, (2) virtual patients, which provide nonsensitive data for collective secondary uses, and (3) individual predictions that support clinical decisions. For a given patient, multiple digital representations may be generated according to the different clinical pathways the patient goes through, each tailored to balance the trade-offs associated with the respective intended uses. Therefore, our proposed framework conceives the medical digital twin as a data architecture leveraging several digital representations of patients along clinical pathways.",

    "abstract": "The attachment relationship constitutes the first emotionally significant affective bond, usually between the infant and the mother, serving as a model for subsequent relationships. It is considered a vital component of social and emotional development in the early years and an important early indicator of infant mental health. In twins, the attachment process may exhibit unique characteristics, influenced by the dual parenting dynamic and the individual needs of each baby. With this article, we intend to explore the challenges of infant-caregiver relationships and the attachment process in twins through a brief, non-systematic literature review regarding a clinical case of a 21-month-old female born from a twin pregnancy complicated by selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR), prematurity, and very low birth weight. The patient was initially suspected of displaying an insecure ambivalent/resistant attachment style, differing from her twin sister. Studies have shown a high concordance in attachment style between twin pairs, although a higher prevalence of insecure ambivalent/resistant attachment style compared to the general population. This may reflect challenges commonly presented in twin pregnancies and the perinatal period, such as sFGR, prematurity, and feeding difficulties, which increase parental stress that may impair early attachment between parents and infants.\u00a0Attachment is not a fixed bond. Early identification and intervention in infant-caregiver relationship difficulties within this vulnerable group can help mitigate the challenges of dual parenting, fostering secure bonds and promoting healthy infant development.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) offer personalized in-silico cardiac representations for the inference of multi-scale properties tied to cardiac mechanisms. The creation of CDTs requires precise information about the electrode position on the torso, especially for the personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) calibration. However, current studies commonly rely on additional acquisition of torso imaging and manual/semi-automatic methods for ECG electrode localization. In this study, we propose a novel and efficient topology-informed model to fully automatically extract personalized ECG standard electrode locations from 2D clinically standard cardiac MRIs. Specifically, we obtain the sparse torso contours from the cardiac MRIs and then localize the standard electrodes of 12-lead ECG from the contours. Cardiac MRIs aim at imaging of the heart instead of the torso, leading to incomplete torso geometry within the imaging. To tackle the missing topology, we incorporate the electrodes as a subset of the keypoints, which can be explicitly aligned with the 3D torso topology. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the time-consuming conventional model projection-based method in terms of accuracy (Euclidean distance: 1.24\u00b10.293 cm vs. 1.48\u00b10.362 cm) and efficiency (2 s vs. 30-35 min). We further demonstrate the effectiveness of using the detected electrodes for in-silico ECG simulation, highlighting their potential for creating accurate and efficient CDT models. The code is available at https://github.com/lileitech/12lead_ECG_electrode_localizer.",

    "abstract": "Nostalgic scenes can trigger nostalgia to a considerable extent and can be effectively used as a nostalgic trigger that contributes to the psychological comfort of the elderly and immigrant populations, but a design system has not been adequately studied. Therefore, the design principles and digital twin (DT) design system of nostalgic scenes is proposed in this study. It focuses on the construction of a nostalgic scene DT model based on the system of system (SoS) theory. Nostalgic scenes related to farm work are selected and photos of this DT model from a particular perspective are generated for presentation. Co-occurrence analysis is used to verify the correlation between elements within the scene. We invited two groups of residents in Xi'an, the regional group and the non-regional group, a total of 68 people, as participants to rate three photos with different degrees of design on the Likert scale. The results of data analysis show that systematic and well-composed nostalgic scene images, which incorporate relevant elements, are more likely to evoke participants' nostalgic emotions than ones without those elements mentioned above. Likewise, a series of nostalgic scene images spanning various periods can stimulate participants' nostalgic emotions more effectively than a single image. Furthermore, region-specific nostalgic scene images that resonate with participants sharing similar lifestyles can trigger their nostalgic feelings more effectively. The digital twin model of the nostalgia scene contains multi-source data, which can be dynamically visualised to represent regional nostalgic experiences. The design system can be used to design nostalgic scenes to improve emotional health, social bonding, tourism, and sustainable urban and rural development.",

    "abstract": "Computational nuclear oncology for precision radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) is a new frontier for theranostic treatment personalization. A key strategy relies on the possibility to incorporate clinical, biomarker, image-based, and dosimetric information in theranostic digital twins (TDTs) of patients to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach. The TDT framework enables treatment optimization by real-time monitoring of the real-world system, simulation of different treatment scenarios, and prediction of resulting treatment outcomes, as well as facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing among health care professionals adopting a harmonized TDT. To this aim, the major social, ethical, and regulatory challenges related to TDT implementation and adoption have been analyzed. ",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twinning is a special case of monozygotic, monoamniotic twinning. Human conjoined twinning, and vertebrate conjoined twinning in general, is a very rare phenomenon. It has been suggested that the risk of conjoined twinning increases with some medication and upon assisted reproduction. Survival rates are low. When conjoined twins occur in the chicken, they most often present with fused heads, anatomically unrecognisable brains and two normal bodies. Recent studies suggested that forebrain, midbrain and rostral hindbrain identities are established in the early epiblast before neural induction and independent from caudal hindbrain and spinal cord identities. Therefore, it is unclear whether in conjoined twins, the aberrant brain anatomy is a result of the rostral fusion, or whether the brains failed to develop in the first place. Here, we collected conjoined twins as they spontaneously appeared in eggs incubated for stages HH4 (late primitive steak stage) to HH13 (early pharyngula). The twinned embryos and stage-matched normal embryos were analysed for the expression of the rostral epiblast and forebrain-midbrain marker Otx2 and the ventral forebrain marker Six3. We found normal anatomy and marker gene expression that lasted up to stage HH9. By HH12-13, the brain anatomy had deteriorated, but marker genes remained expressed. This suggests that the fusing embryos attempted to generate a brain including the forebrain. Besides addressing forebrain development, our work for the first time provides a time frame to study the mechanisms underlying the interaction and fusion of conjoined twins, which will pave the way to a better understanding and management of risk factors in humans.",

    "abstract": "Understanding clinical trajectories of sepsis patients is crucial for prognostication, resource planning, and to inform digital twin models of critical illness. This study aims to identify common clinical trajectories based on dynamic assessment of cardiorespiratory support using a validated electronic health record data that covers retrospective cohort of 19,177 patients with sepsis admitted to ICUs of Mayo Clinic Hospitals over eight-year period. Patient trajectories were modeled from ICU admission up to 14 days using an unsupervised machine learning two-stage clustering method based on cardiorespiratory support in ICU and hospital discharge status. Of 19,177 patients, 42% were female with a median age of 65 (IQR, 55-76) years, APACHE III score of 70 (IQR, 56-87), hospital length of stay (LOS) of 7 (IQR, 4-12) days, and ICU LOS of 2 (IQR, 1-4) days. Four distinct trajectories were identified: fast recovery (27% with a mortality rate of 3.5% and median hospital LOS of 3 (IQR, 2-15) days), slow recovery (62% with a mortality rate of 3.6% and hospital LOS of 8 (IQR, 6-13) days), fast decline (4% with a mortality rate of 99.7% and hospital LOS of 1 (IQR, 0-1) day), and delayed decline (7% with a mortality rate of 97.9% and hospital LOS of 5 (IQR, 3-8) days). Distinct trajectories remained robust and were distinguished by Charlston comorbidity index, Apache III scores, day 1 and day 3 SOFA (p < 0.001 ANOVA). These findings provide a foundation for developing prediction models and digital twin decision support tools, improving both shared decision-making and resource planning.",

    "abstract": "Fivefold twins are extensively present in nanoparticles and nanowires, enhancing their performance in physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. However, a deep insight into the correlation between mechanical properties and fivefold twins in bulk nanograined materials is lacking due to synthesis difficulties. Here, a bulk fivefold-twinned nanograined Ni is synthesized via electrodeposition. The fivefold-twinned nanograins typically feature decahedral and icosahedral shapes similar to fivefold-twinned particles. The material exhibits a yield strength of \u22481.7\u00a0GPa under both compression and tension. Tensile samples achieve an ultimate strength of 2.15\u00a0GPa with 15% elongation to failure. The plastic deformation is accommodated by partial dislocation sliding on twin boundaries, splitting fivefold twins, and abnormally refining grains. The size dependence of nucleation stress for partial dislocation is responsible for strengthening and strain hardening. The results showcase the potential of incorporating fivefold twins into bulk nanocrystalline materials to tailor mechanical properties and applications across diverse fields.",

    "abstract": "Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS) is a genetic disorder characterized by intrauterine and postnatal growth restriction. Most cases are caused by an imprinting error either with hypomethylation of the Imprinted Control Region 1 at 11p15.5, or maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7. Approximately 40% of the cases have unknown etiology, thus distinct mechanisms have been described in association with the syndrome. Here, we present a case of monozygotic twin sisters with a clinical diagnosis of SRS, mild intellectual disability and epilepsy who carry a balanced translocation between chromosomes 3 and 12 that interrupts the NAALADL2 and HMGA2 genes, respectively. Disruption of HMGA2, a gene previously described as causative of SRS, confirms the initial diagnosis. NAALADL2 gene has been recently proposed as a candidate for intellectual disability and could partially contribute to our patient's phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Research to identify fetal predictors of infant mortality among singletons born in the United States (US) concludes that poorly understood and unmeasured \"confounders\" produce a spurious association between fetal size and infant death. We argue that these confounders include Vanishing Twin Syndrome (VTS)-the clinical manifestation of selection against frail male twins \nWe use Box-Jenkins transfer function modeling to test the hypothesis that among infants born from 276 monthly conception cohorts conceived in the US from January 1995 through December 2017, the sex ratio of twins born in the 37th week of gestation will correlate inversely with infant mortality among singleton males born at the 40th week of gestation.\nWe find support for our hypothesis and infer that the contribution of survivors of VTS to temporal variation in infant mortality among the hardiest of singleton male infants, those born at 40 weeks gestation, ranged from a decrease of about 7% to an increase of about 5% over our 276 monthly conception cohorts.\nWe conclude that an evolutionary perspective on fetal loss makes a heretofore \"unmeasured confounder\" of the relationship between fetal size and infant mortality both explicable and measurable. This finding may help clinicians better anticipate changes over time in the incidence of infant mortality.",

Generalized estimation equation (GEE) was used to examine the association between Cytosine-phosphate-Guanines (CpGs) DNAm and eGFR. Inference about Causation from Examination of FAmiliaL CONfounding was employed to infer the causal relationship. The comb-p was used to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs). GeneMANIA was used to analyze the gene interaction network. The Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool enriched biological functions and pathways. Gene expression profiling sequencing was employed to measure mRNA expression levels, and the GEE model was used to investigate the association between gene expression and eGFR. The candidate gene was validated in a community population by calculating the methylation risk score (MRS).\nA total of 80 CpGs and 28 DMRs, located at genes such as OLIG2, SYNGR3, LONP1, CDCP1, and SHANK1, achieved genome-wide significance level (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05). The causal effect of DNAm on eGFR was supported by 12 CpGs located at genes such as SYNGR3 and C9orf3. In contrast, the causal effect of eGFR on DNAm is proved by 13 CpGs located at genes such as EPHB3 and MLLT1. Enrichment analysis revealed several important biological functions and pathways related to eGFR, including alpha-2A adrenergic receptor binding pathway and corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor activity pathway. GeneMANIA results showed that SYNGR3 was co-expressed with MLLT1 and had genetic interactions with AFF4 and EDIL3. Gene expression analysis found that SYNGR3 expression was negatively associated with eGFR. Validation analysis showed that the MRS of SYNGR3 was positively associated with low eGFR levels.\nWe identified a set of CpGs, DMRs, and pathways potentially associated with eGFR, particularly in the SYNGR3 gene. These findings provided new insights into the epigenetic modifications related to the decline in eGFR and chronic kidney disease.",

    "abstract": "This literature review explores the emerging role of digital twin (DT) technology in ophthalmology, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize personalized medicine. DTs integrate diverse data sources, including genetic, environmental, and real-time patient data, to create dynamic, predictive models that enhance risk assessment, surgical planning, and postoperative care. The review highlights vital case studies demonstrating the application of DTs in improving the early detection and management of diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. While implementing DTs presents challenges, including data integration and privacy concerns, the potential benefits, such as improved patient outcomes and cost savings, position DTs as a valuable tool in the future of ophthalmic care. The review underscores the need for further research to address these challenges and fully realize the potential of DTs in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins, although rare, present unique challenges in surgical management, particularly regarding skin closure after separation. This case report details the successful separation of pygopagus conjoined twins using a rectangular skin flap technique. The twins, joined at the lumbar and sacral regions, underwent meticulous preoperative planning and collaborative effort from multiple medical teams. The surgery involved raising fasciocutaneous rectangular flaps over the buttocks, spine separation, rectal division, and reconstruction of pelvic floor muscles. The primary skin closure was achieved successfully. This case highlights the superior gluteal-based rectangular flap technique in such a separation and the importance of multidisciplinary approaches in improving outcomes for complex surgeries.",

    "abstract": "Arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by elongation and tortuosity of the aorta and mid-sized arteries. Additional features typical of connective tissue disorders are usually present, but the clinical presentation of the syndrome can extensively change. The cardiovascular implications are the major source of morbidity and mortality and can be present even during the neonatal period; therefore, a correct neonatal management is extremely important. However, only few cases of ATS have been suspected or diagnosed prenatally.\nIn our study, we present a rare case of dichorionic twins both affected by ATS, in which the syndrome was suspected antenatally. Moreover, we performed a review of the literature and summarized the main findings identified at prenatal ultrasounds and postnatal examination, in order to help clinicians with the management of this rare diagnosis.\nThe most suspicious ultrasound prenatal finding of ATS is the elongation and tortuosity of great arteries. When ATS is suspected prenatally, the newborn should be referred immediately after birth to a high specialized center for proper neonatal care. In case of confirmed ATS, parents should be counseled regarding the recurrence risk in other pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins with amniotic fluid abnormalities that do not meet criteria for twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) concern physicians and families. This study aimed to describe the natural history of amniotic fluid abnormalities.\nIn this retrospective case-control study, TTTS screening ultrasounds and clinical records throughout all MCDA twin gestations were reviewed between 2018 and 2022 at a tertiary fetal care center. Twin pairs with normal imaging throughout gestation comprised a control group. Cases with fluid abnormalities were divided into four subgroups: (1) isolated polyhydramnios of one twin, (2) isolated oligohydramnios of one twin, (3) subjective physician concern about fluid discrepancy without objectively abnormal fluid in either twin, (4) or selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) with any of the above fluid abnormalities. Since the aim was to trend unclear fluid findings, twins who flipped from normal imaging to clear diagnostic criteria for TTTS, selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR), or twin-anemia polycythemia sequence (TAPS) within one scan were excluded. Also excluded were gestations with structural anomalies affecting fluid quantity, higher order multiples, and cases with only one scan available.\nOf 737 gestations, 300 were excluded for clear diagnostic findings, 19 had a fetal anomaly impacting fluid, 10 were higher order multiples, and 44 had only one scan. Of the remaining 364, 224 had normal imaging and formed the control group, while 140 had fluid abnormalities not diagnostic for TTTS. Twins with fluid abnormalities developed more TTTS (41\u00a0%), TAPS (8\u00a0%), new-onset sFGR (11\u00a0%), and need for laser (36\u00a0% vs 0\u00a0%, all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Fetal demise (11\u00a0% vs 1\u00a0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and maternal admissions for fetal surveillance (15\u00a0% vs 4\u00a0% p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) were seen more often in cases, who also had an earlier gestational age at delivery (33.1 vs 35.1\u00a0weeks, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) when compared to controls.\nAmniotic fluid abnormalities that do not yet meet criteria for TTTS should be considered a warning sign in MCDA twin pregnancies. These abnormalities are associated with more complications, fetal intervention, fetal demise, and long hospital stays.",

    "abstract": "Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) which is judged based on birth weight and gestational age, is associated with increased neonatal mobility and mortality and also has a further impact on physical and mental health during later in life. Using the birth weight percentile for singletons to assess twins might not accurately reflect the growth status of the twins; this could potentially lead to an incorrect evaluation of growth-restricted children. For a more precise assessment of twin newborns, it is beneficial to utilize twin-specific birth weight percentile curves and ponderal index (PI) curves that consider factors such as birth order and sex. The aim of this study is to establish a contemporary up-to-date method that provides sex-specific percentiles for birth weight and the PI of twin neonates, categorized by gestational age and differentiated by chorionicity within a defined cross-sectional study.\nWe retrospectively analyzed the birth weight and PI percentile of 3,433 twins born at a gestational age between 25 and 40 weeks based on sex and chorionicity, between 2015 and 2020 in a single center in southern China. The smoothed percentile curves were drawn via generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS).\nA total of 3,433 live-born twins were included in this study and consisted of 366 monochorionic girls, 405 monochorionic boys, 1,237 dichorionic girls and 1,425 dichorionic boys. Compared with dichorionic twins, the mean birth weight of monochorionic twins was significantly lower and the gestational week of delivery was earlier. The calculated 50th percentile birth weight values for twin boys were higher than those for girls based on the same chorionicity, except for those male monochorionic twins who were born before week 31 of gestation.\nThe birth weight and PI percentile charts for neonates, categorized by sex and chorionicity, serve as valuable tools for assessing the wellbeing of twin infants. Utilizing these charts could reduce the overdiagnosis of small for gestational (SGA) age in normally growing twins.",

    "abstract": "We aim to study the potential association between tattoo ink exposure and development of certain types of cancers in the recently established Danish Twin Tattoo Cohort. Tattoo ink is known to transfer from skin to blood and accumulate in regional lymph nodes. We are concerned that tattoo ink induces inflammation at the deposit site, leading to chronic inflammation and increasing risk of abnormal cell proliferation, especially skin cancer and lymphoma.\nWe conducted two designs of twin studies to improve confounder control: A cohort study of 2,367 randomly selected twins and a case-control study of 316 twins born in the period 1960-1996. Cancer diagnoses (ICD-10) were retrieved from the Danish Cancer Registry and tattoo ink exposure from the Danish Twin Tattoo survey from 2021. The analysis addressed effects of time-varying exposure.\nIn the case-control study, individual-level analysis resulted in a hazard of skin cancer (of any type except basal cell carcinoma) that was 1.62 times higher among tattooed individuals (95% CI: 1.08-2.41). Twin-matched analysis of 14 twin pairs discordant for tattoo ink exposure and skin cancer showed HR\u2009=\u20091.33 (95% CI: 0.46-3.84). For skin cancer and lymphoma, increased hazards were found for tattoos larger than the palm of a hand: HR\u2009=\u20092.37 (95% CI: 1.11-5.06) and HR\u2009=\u20092.73 (95% CI: 1.33-5.60), respectively. In the cohort study design, individual-level analysis resulted in a hazard ratio of 3.91 (95% CI: 1.42-10.8) for skin cancer and 2.83 (95% CI: 1.30-6.16) for basal cell carcinoma.\nIn conclusion, our study suggests an increased hazard of lymphoma and skin cancers among tattooed individuals, demonstrated through two designs: a twin cohort and a case-cotwin study. We are concerned that tattoo ink interacting with surrounding cells may have severe consequences. Studies that pinpoint the etiological pathway of tattoo ink induced carcinogenesis are recommended to benefit public health.",

    "abstract": "The growing prevalence of assisted reproductive technology (ART) is leading to a continuous rise in twin pregnancies. This study assessed the influence of ART on neonatal outcomes of twin pregnancies. Clinical records of twin deliveries at Fujian Maternity and Child Health Hospital between 2019 and 2021 were retrospectively selected and grouped based on the method of conception: ART-conceived and naturally conceived. Neonatal outcomes of interest included low birth weight (LBW), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), prematurity, low Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity and Respiration scores, and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to adjust for potential confounders. The results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 1270 pairs of twins were included in the analysis. ART-conceived twins had significantly lower odds of being born with LBW (adjusted OR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.75), prematurity (adjusted OR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.91), and IUGR (adjusted OR 0.21, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.39) compared to naturally conceived twins. Rates of other outcomes were comparable in both groups. Twins born through ART had reduced odds of LBW, prematurity, and IUGR, with no impact on other neonatal outcomes. These findings suggest that ART may have a protective effect on twin fetal growth, although the risks associated with multiple gestations remain. Further studies should explore the mechanisms and long-term effects of these outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Although genetic factors have been identified in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the concordance rate in monozygotic (MZ) twins is low, suggesting that other features contribute to disease development. Further, the relative contribution of such non-genetic elements in identical twins have not been characterized. Here, we aimed to measure differentiating host and microbial biomarkers of RA by studying MZ twins discordant for disease using a multi-omics approach.\nEight pairs of MZ twins discordant for RA (n=16) were enrolled. Gut microbiome was assessed using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Autoantibodies, cytokines, and other plasma proteins were measured in both plasma and feces. Levels of short and medium-chain fatty acids from serum and feces were quantified using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS).\nWhile overall microbiome diversity and composition did not significantly differ between twins, we observed a decrease in \nMulti-omics biomarkers differentiate MZ twins discordant for RA.

    "abstract": "Tongue tie is an added complication when breastfeeding, but little is known about the role tongue tie might play when breastfeeding twins.\nTwins are much less likely to be breastfed than singleton babies due to added complications regarding pregnancy, birth and ongoing care. Tongue tie can cause breastfeeding barriers including poor latch, inefficient milk transfer and nipple pain.\nThe aim of this study was to conduct an in-depth exploration of the experiences of mothers who have breastfeed twins with suspected or diagnosed tongue tie.\nInterview and qualitative survey data exploring the experience of breastfeeding twins and multiples were analysed with a focus on the experiences of participants reporting on suspected or diagnosed tongue tie. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.\nThree themes were developed. These were: 1) feeling disempowered by tongue tie denial; which illustrated the experience of dismissal by healthcare professionals, 2) the avoidable impact of diagnostic delay; highlighting the practical, physical and psychological impact of tongue tie, and 3) improvements following intervention; illustrating the immediate improvements experienced following frenotomy.\nMothers who suspect tongue tie find themselves disempowered by denial of their experiences and needing to fight for intervention. Long delays lead to distress for both mother and child while intervention often leads to instant improvement.\nImproved healthcare professional training and healthcare policy changes are needed to improve tongue tie support and intervention for parents of twins and reduce the threat to mother and child health and wellbeing.\nProblem or Issue: Breastfeeding rates for twins are much lower than for singleton babies. For some infants tongue tie may be an additional barrier to breastfeeding success.\nResearch with parents of singleton babies has shown that tongue tie can cause distress, frustration and physical pain for mothers who report dismissal by healthcare professionals and a need to fight for support.\nThe voices of parents of infants with tongue tie who have successfully breastfed twins are presented. Like parents of singleton infants, they experienced diagnostic delays and psychological and physical impacts of tongue tie. Intervention was often sought privately when NHS support was lacking. Regardless of source, tongue tie intervention often led to immediate improvement highlighting how the added stresses and challenges created by tongue tie for twin parents could be prevented with appropriate support and intervention following birth.",

    "abstract": "Scoliosis is an idiopathic three-dimensional spine strain. The orthopedic parameter used to diagnose and evaluate the severity of the strain is Cobb's angle. This study proposes using this clinical parameter to reproduce a digital twin of the spine, calculate biomechanical stress changes, and characterize idiopathic scoliosis deformity through symmetrical degeneration of intervertebral discs, relying on patient-specific radiological measurements of the scoliotic curves.\nA three-dimensional computational model of the spine was developed, where patient-specific curves were generated by modifying intervertebral disc mechanical properties via a mathematical model derived from radiological data. Validation of the model was performed by comparing the resultant scoliotic curves with patient radiological images. Finite element analysis was then used to elucidate the biomechanical effects on the spine due to the deformity.\nThe model successfully replicated patient-specific thoracic scoliotic deformities, revealing a discernible relationship between disc strain and its proximity to the apex, indicating a heightened risk of disc stress closer to the apex. Moreover, \"type-C\" curves exhibited a greater risk of herniation compared to \"type-S\" curves due to differences in compressive stress distribution.\nThis modeling approach enhances the understanding of scoliosis biomechanics, facilitating risk assessment for disc prolapse and aiding in treatment selection, including the design of condition-specific orthotics. Furthermore, it establishes a quantitative link between scoliosis severity and disc strain, integrating Cobb's angle and other orthopedic parameters into computational models to approximate patient-specific conditions.",

    "abstract": "Patients with congenital heart defects (CHDs) are at higher risk for infectious diseases. This may partly be due to frequent hospital stays and the associated exposure to pathogens. This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of immunisation coverage among twins in which at least one twin has CHD. Confounding factors from shared environments and genetic components can be controlled through co-twin control analysis, thus minimising confounding effects.\nIn the framework of the cross-sectional twin study \"Same Same, but different?\" twins, with at least one of them having CHD aged 3 to 99 years, were recruited nationwide in Germany between August 2019 and December 2022. Their primary immunisation status based on the German Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) and immunisation against respiratory diseases, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), pneumococci, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), were assessed and compared between the twins.\nIn total, 64 twins (128 individuals) were included for direct twin comparison. Overall, 56.3% of the twins reached complete primary immunisation status, negatively influenced by hospitalisation duration [odds ratio (OR): 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.96-0.99; P=0.01]. Compared to their healthy twin, twins with CHD received their rotavirus vaccine significantly later (P=0.04). Only 3.1% of the twins with CHD received the pneumococcal vaccine recommended for high-risk patients. A higher number of catheter interventions can lead to a higher number of patients receiving the pneumococcal vaccine (OR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.16-2.76; P=0.009). The direct twin comparison showed a significant difference between the twins in vaccination against influenza (P=0.007), although it is recommended for CHD patients and their household contacts-including their twin. A higher number of surgeries (OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.12-2.05; P=0.007) and catheter interventions (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.00-2.21; P=0.049) increase the probability of influenza vaccination in CHD patients.\nIn the direct twin comparison, twins are similarly vaccinated except for RSV and influenza. Immunisation against influenza in twins should be improved. With new upcoming RSV vaccines, existing recommendations must be reconsidered and adapted. Another disturbing fact is that only 30% of infants are vaccinated against pertussis and pneumococcus within the primary recommended timeframe, even though they are exposed at high risk during infancy. Further education of parents, patients, and medical staff might lead to higher vaccination coverage, especially in pneumococcal vaccines recommended for high-risk patients. We must provide sufficient information on the importance of vaccinations and their side effects for parents' and patients' decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twin pregnancies carry a risk of perinatal complications due to shared placental anastomoses, which can cause uneven blood distribution and lead to conditions like selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR). This case describes a monochorionic pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia and late-onset sFGR of twin B. Labor was prematurely induced and a 45% weight discordance between the twins was confirmed. Twin A adapted well to extrauterine life, but a routine cerebral ultrasound on the second day revealed a periventricular venous infarction. Subsequent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed deep medullary vein thrombosis and multiple small ischemic lesions secondary to hypoxia. Twin B, born with anhydramnios, experienced several perinatal complications including resuscitation at birth and acute kidney injury. By the fourth day, twin B developed inconsolable irritability, intermittent opisthotonus, and a cortical thumb. The\u00a0brain MRI showed pachygyria, suggesting a cortical development malformation. sFGR can lead to severe cerebral injuries and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, often impacting the larger twin due to acute in-utero blood volume shifts between the twins through placental anastomoses, while also causing brain growth restriction in the smaller twin. Balancing the risks of prematurity against the potentially serious outcomes in twins poses a significant challenge in the management of sFGR cases.",

    "abstract": "Power transformers play a crucial role in enabling the integration of renewable energy sources and improving the overall efficiency and reliability of smart grid systems. They facilitate the conversion, transmission, and distribution of power from various sources and help to balance the load between different parts of the grid. The Transformer Health Index (THI) is one of the most important indicators of ensuring their reliability and preventing unplanned outages. To this end, this study introduces a proposed new architecture called a Smart Electricity Monitoring System based on Fog Computing and Digital Twins (SEMS-FDT) for monitoring the health performance of transformers by measuring the THI rate in real time. The SEMS-FDT is specifically designed to enable the observation of the transformer's health and performance purposes in real time. The study investigates the role of machine learning (ML) models, including traditional and ensemble methods, in predicting THI and LI (Heat Load Index) by exploring the use of the entire set of features and optimized feature subsets for prediction. To improve the forecasting prediction process and achieve optimal performance a novel multitasks LSTM_GRU model is also proposed. The experimental results demonstrate that there is a promising performance of 2.543, 0.13646, 0.0284, and 0.985 for MSE, MAE, MedAE, and R2 scores respectively. Moreover, the framework is extended by incorporating model explanations, which include global explanations, which provide insights based on the entire dataset, and local explanations, which offer instance-specific explanations. The integration of the proposed model and explainability features provides engineers with comprehensive outcomes regarding the model's result.",

    "abstract": "The health care industry must align with new digital technologies to respond to existing and new challenges. Digital twins (DTs) are an emerging technology for digital transformation and applied intelligence that is rapidly attracting attention. DTs are virtual representations of products, systems, or processes that interact bidirectionally in real time with their actual counterparts. Although DTs have diverse applications from personalized care to treatment optimization, misconceptions persist regarding their definition and the extent of their implementation within health systems.\nThis study aimed to review DT applications in health care, particularly for clinical decision-making (CDM) and operational decision-making (ODM). It provides a definition and framework for DTs by exploring their unique elements and characteristics. Then, it assesses the current advances and extent of DT applications to support CDM and ODM using the defined DT characteristics.\nWe conducted a scoping review following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) protocol. We searched multiple databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus, for original research articles describing DT technologies applied to CDM and ODM in health systems. Papers proposing only ideas or frameworks or describing DT capabilities without experimental data were excluded. We collated several available types of information, for example, DT characteristics, the environment that DTs were tested within, and the main underlying method, and used descriptive statistics to analyze the synthesized data.\nOut of 5537 relevant papers, 1.55% (86/5537) met the predefined inclusion criteria, all published after 2017. The majority focused on CDM (75/86, 87%). Mathematical modeling (24/86, 28%) and simulation techniques (17/86, 20%) were the most frequently used methods. Using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision coding, we identified 3 key areas of DT applications as follows: factors influencing diseases of the circulatory system (14/86, 16%); health status and contact with health services (12/86, 14%); and endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases (10/86, 12%). Only 16 (19%) of 86 studies tested the developed system in a real environment, while the remainder were evaluated in simulated settings. Assessing the studies against defined DT characteristics reveals that the developed systems have yet to materialize the full capabilities of DTs.\nThis study provides a comprehensive review of DT applications in health care, focusing on CDM and ODM. A key contribution is the development of a framework that defines important elements and characteristics of DTs in the context of related literature. The DT applications studied in this paper reveal encouraging results that allow us to envision that, in the near future, they will play an important role not only in the diagnosis and prevention of diseases but also in other areas, such as efficient clinical trial design, as well as personalized and optimized treatments.",

    "results": "Out of 5537 relevant papers, 1.55% (86/5537) met the predefined inclusion criteria, all published after 2017. The majority focused on CDM (75/86, 87%). Mathematical modeling (24/86, 28%) and simulation techniques (17/86, 20%) were the most frequently used methods. Using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision coding, we identified 3 key areas of DT applications as follows: factors influencing diseases of the circulatory system (14/86, 16%); health status and contact with health services (12/86, 14%); and endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases (10/86, 12%). Only 16 (19%) of 86 studies tested the developed system in a real environment, while the remainder were evaluated in simulated settings. Assessing the studies against defined DT characteristics reveals that the developed systems have yet to materialize the full capabilities of DTs.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic (MC) twins share a single placenta which can be unequally shared, leading to selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR). Limited data is available on the prevalence and clinical consequences of proximate cord insertion (PCI) in sFGR pregnancies.\nWe aimed to investigate the prevalence of PCI in MC placentas with and without sFGR and per type of sFGR, and study the placental characteristics and perinatal outcome of PCI in sFGR pregnancies.\nIn this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we included all consecutive placentas of MC twin pregnancies with and without sFGR evaluated between 2002-2023. We excluded MC twins with twin-twin transfusion syndrome, twin anemia polycythemia sequence and monoamnionicity. Our primary outcome included the prevalence of PCI (distance between cord insertions \u22644 cm) and type of cord insertions categorized as concordant, intermediate or discordant. Secondary outcomes consisted of type and size of placental vascular anastomoses and short-term clinical outcomes including fetal demise and birth weight discordance (BWD).\nOf 813 MC placentas, 468 were from uncomplicated twins and 345 from sFGR twins (187 type I, 41 type II and 117 type III sFGR). The prevalence of PCI in uncomplicated versus sFGR placentas was 3.8% (18/468) and 4.6% (16/345), respectively (p=0.58). PCI in sFGR type I, II and III was detected in 0.5% (1/187), 0% (0/41) and 12.8% (15/117), respectively (p<0.0001). The prevalence of discordant cord insertions (velamentous-paracentral) in uncomplicated twin placentas and sFGR placentas was 19.9% (93/468) and 45.5% (157/345), respectively (p<0.0001). Diameter of arterio-arterial (AA) anastomoses in sFGR placentas with and without PCI was 3.0 mm (IQR 2.7-5.0) versus 2.2 mm (IQR 1.4-3.1; p<0.0061). BWD in sFGR twins with PCI was 18.5% (IQR 16.4-21.0) and without PCI was 28.0% (IQR 21.8-35.9; p<0.0001). Fetal demise occurred in 12.5% (2/16) of pregnancies with PCI and 6.1% (20/329) of sFGR pregnancies without PCI (p=0.27).\nsFGR type III placentas exhibit a high prevalence of PCI, requiring increased awareness due to the presence of larger AA anastomoses and a potentially higher risk of fetal demise.",

    "abstract": "Antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) administration before anticipated preterm birth is one of the most important interventions available to improve neonatal outcomes. Nevertheless, this treatment is associated with an increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. The aim of this study was to determine whether preterm twins who receive ACS are at increased risk for developing neonatal hypoglycemia.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of indicated and spontaneous preterm births of twins at a single center between 2011 and 2018. The study population included 3 groups matched for gestational age at delivery and birth weight: (1) Twin neonates who received a course of ACS 1-7 days before birth (n = 532); (2) twins who did not receive ACS at that time interval (n = 532); and (3) singletons receiving ACS 1-7 days before birth (n = 266). The primary outcome was neonatal hypoglycemia (<40 mg/dL/2.2 mmol/L) within the first 24 h and 48 h of life.\nThe rate of neonatal hypoglycemia during the first 24 h of life was significantly higher in singletons exposed to ACS compared to twins not exposed to ACS (p = 0.019) and in twins exposed to ACS compared to twins not exposed to ACS (p = 0.047). The rate of neonatal hypoglycemia was almost identical between twins and singletons exposed to ACS (p = 0.72). Regression analysis revealed that exposure to ACS and birth weight were independently associated with neonatal hypoglycemia after adjustment for maternal age, body mass index, gravidity, gestational diabetes mellitus, and gestational age at delivery.\nExposure to ACS, rather than plurality, is associated with short-lived neonatal hypoglycemia.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins, or Siamese twins as they are commonly called, are a rare and extreme form of monochorionic twinning. Imaging plays an essential role in the diagnosis and follow-up of conjoined twins. While ultrasound is often the screening modality of choice, MRI is carried out for better anatomical delineation and further characterization as and when necessary. We present a unique case of first trimester thoraco-omphalopagus conjoined twins with cystic hygroma who were comprehensively evaluated with sonography and MRI with imaging findings confirmed post-pregnancy termination. The case stresses upon the utility of advanced imaging techniques including foetal MRI that immensely contribute towards a reliable diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Current outcomes from catheter ablation for scar-dependent ventricular tachycardia (VT) are limited by high recurrence rates and long procedure durations. Personalized heart digital twin technology presents a noninvasive method of predicting critical substrate in VT, and its integration into clinical VT ablation offers a promising solution. The accuracy of the predictions of digital twins to detect invasive substrate abnormalities is unknown. We present the first prospective analysis of digital twin technology in predicting critical substrate abnormalities in VT.\nHeart digital twin models were created from 18 patients with scar-dependent VT undergoing catheter ablation. Contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance images were used to reconstruct finite-element meshes, onto which regional electrophysiological properties were applied. Rapid-pacing protocols were used to induce VTs and to define the VT circuits. Predicted optimum ablation sites to terminate all VTs in the models were identified. Invasive substrate mapping was performed, and the digital twins were merged with the electroanatomical map. Electrogram abnormalities and regions of conduction slowing were compared between digital twin-predicted sites and nonpredicted areas.\nElectrogram abnormalities were significantly more frequent in digital twin-predicted sites compared with nonpredicted sites (468/1029 [45.5%] versus 519/1611 [32.2%]; \nDigital twin-predicted sites display a higher prevalence of abnormal and prolonged electrograms compared with nonpredicted sites and accurately identify regions of conduction slowing. Digital twin technology may help improve substrate-based VT ablation.\nURL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT04632394.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Multifetal pregnancies, which account for 2-4% of births worldwide, have increased in recent years. Twin pregnancies carry a higher risk of preterm birth and associated neonatal morbimortality, with monochorionic twins considered at greater risk. This study investigates the influence of chorionicity on neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm twins. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including preterm twins born before 32 weeks of gestational age and/or with a birth weight of less than 1500 grams, admitted to a tertiary-hospital neonatal intensive care unit from 2013 to 2021. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were evaluated at 24 months of corrected age using the Griffiths II Mental Development Scales. Moderate to severe neurodevelopmental impairment was determined by the occurrence of one or more of the listed criteria: global development quotient <70, severe visual impairment, cerebral palsy, or profound sensorineural deafness. Results A total of 125 preterm twins were evaluated, of which 45% (n=56) were monochorionic. Overall, 5.6% (n=7) of the infants had moderate to severe neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI), with higher comorbidity rates in this group. No significant differences were found in NDI or other prematurity-related comorbidities between monochorionic and dichorionic twins. Gestational age over 27 weeks and birth weight over 1010 grams were identified as accurate predictors for an absence of moderate to severe NDI in these infants. Conclusion Chorionicity alone does not appear to independently affect neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm twins when complications are effectively managed. Improved prenatal monitoring and appropriate treatment of twin pregnancies, especially monochorionic, are crucial to mitigate risks associated with moderate to severe neurodevelopmental impairment.",

    "abstract": "Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have established association between genetic variants and pulmonary function across various ethnics, whereas such associations are scarcely reported in Chinese adults. Therefore, we conducted an GWAS to explore relationships between genetic variants and pulmonary function among middle-aged Chinese dizygotic twins and further validated the top variants using data from the UK Biobank (UKB).\nIn the discovery phase, 139 dizygotic twin pairs were drawn from the Qingdao Twin Registry. Pulmonary function was assessed using three parameters: forced expiratory volume the first second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC ratio. GWAS was performed using GEMMA, Gene-based analysis was conducted by VEGAS2. And pathway enrichment analysis was performed using PASCAL. In the validation phase, Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with suggestive significance were examined through linear regression analysis of the additive effect model among 1573 Chinese ethnic participants from UKB.\nThe median age of twin pairs in the study was 49 years. 3 SNPs (rs80345886, rs117883876, and 75139439) related to FEV1 achieved genome-wide significance. Moreover, 222, 150, and 73 SNPs surpassed suggestive evidence level (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nOur GWAS results on Chinese dizygotic twins provide new references for the genetic regulation on pulmonary function.

    "abstract": "Suboptimal diets increase morbidity and mortality risk. Epigenetic clocks are algorithms that can assess health and lifespan, even at a young age, before clinical manifestations of diseases. We investigated the association between dietary patterns and biological aging in young adult twins.\nThe data were drawn from the population-based FinnTwin12 study and consisted of twins aged 21-25 years (n\u00a0=\u00a0826). Food and beverage intakes were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Biological aging was estimated using the epigenetic clocks GrimAge and DunedinPACE. Latent class analysis was used to identify dietary patterns. The association between dietary patterns and biological aging was assessed using linear regression modeling at the individual level, followed by within-twin pair analyses to account for genetic liabilities and shared familial confounders.\nSix dietary patterns were identified: 1) High fast food, low fruits and vegetables (F&V), 2) Plant-based, 3) Health-conscious, 4) Western with infrequent fish, 5) Western with regular fish, and 6) Balanced average. At the individual level, GrimAge acceleration was slower in the Plant-based, Health-conscious, and Balanced-average patterns compared to the High fast food, low F&V, and faster in the Western with infrequent fish pattern compared to the Balanced average, regardless of sex, nonalcoholic energy intake, smoking, and alcohol consumption. After further adjustment for BMI and sports participation, the strengths of the associations modestly decreased; however, the difference between the Balanced-average and High fast food, low F&V patterns remained significant. The pace of aging (DunedinPACE) was slower in the Plant-based pattern compared to the High fast food, low F&V and the Western with infrequent fish patterns after adjustment for sex, nonalcoholic energy intake, smoking, and alcohol. The effect sizes were attenuated and reached a non-significant level when BMI and sports participation were added to the model. Most of the associations were replicated in the within-pair analyses among all twin pairs and among dizygotic twin pairs, but the effect sizes tended to be smaller among monozygotic twin pairs. This suggests that genetics, but not a shared environment, may partially explain the observed associations between diet and biological aging.\nDiets high in fast food, processed red meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages and low in fruits and vegetables are associated with accelerated biological aging in young adulthood. The clustering effect of lifestyle factors and genetic confounders should be considered when interpreting the findings.",

At the individual level, GrimAge acceleration was slower in the Plant-based, Health-conscious, and Balanced-average patterns compared to the High fast food, low F&V, and faster in the Western with infrequent fish pattern compared to the Balanced average, regardless of sex, nonalcoholic energy intake, smoking, and alcohol consumption. After further adjustment for BMI and sports participation, the strengths of the associations modestly decreased; however, the difference between the Balanced-average and High fast food, low F&V patterns remained significant. The pace of aging (DunedinPACE) was slower in the Plant-based pattern compared to the High fast food, low F&V and the Western with infrequent fish patterns after adjustment for sex, nonalcoholic energy intake, smoking, and alcohol. The effect sizes were attenuated and reached a non-significant level when BMI and sports participation were added to the model. Most of the associations were replicated in the within-pair analyses among all twin pairs and among dizygotic twin pairs, but the effect sizes tended to be smaller among monozygotic twin pairs. This suggests that genetics, but not a shared environment, may partially explain the observed associations between diet and biological aging.",

    "abstract": "How are the changing maternal age structure and population growth expected to shape future twinning rates in low-income countries?\nWith maternal age at birth projected to shift toward older ages, twinning rates are also estimated to increase in most low-income countries by 2050 and even more by 2100.\nMany of the sub-Saharan African and South Asian countries are undergoing, and projected to further experience, the shift of maternal age at birth to older ages. Advanced maternal age is a well-established predictor of multiple births at the individual level, but currently, it is unknown how the changes in maternal age distribution are associated with the changes in twinning rates at the population level in low-income countries.\nWe first estimated age-specific twinning probability based on Demographic Health Surveys and World Fertility Surveys data. We then scaled up the age-specific twinning probability at the population level to estimate changes in the number of twin births in 2050 and 2100 attributable to the estimated shifts in maternal age toward older ages as projected by the UN World Population Prospects (WPP).\nWe analyzed \u223c3.19 million births that occurred within 10\u2009years before the interview. Majority of the births in our data took place between 1980 and 2015 across 39 countries, where the uptake of medically assisted reproduction (MAR) is known to have been low during the observation period. We estimated country fixed-effects models to obtain country-specific twinning rates and age-specific twinning probability. We applied these estimates to the future number of births projected by the UN WPP, to estimate the number of twin births in 2050 and 2100.\nWith maternal age at birth projected to shift toward older ages, twinning rates are also estimated to increase in most countries by 2050 compared to 2010 (increases from 0.3% to 63% depending on countries), and even more in all studied countries by 2100 (increases from 3.5% to 79%). Due to its large population size, India will continue to have among the largest share of twin births despite its estimated decline of twin births by 10.5% by 2100. Nigeria, due to its not only large and growing population size but also high twinning rate, is expected to contribute the second largest number of twin births.\nAlthough the accuracy in maternal recall of multiple births tends to be high, our use of data based on recalled births from the past nonetheless imply a potential bias in our estimation of twinning rates.\nThe present study suggests that, even if the spread of MAR remains slow in many low-income countries, twinning rates and number of twin births are expected to grow as an increase in maternal age at birth and population growth continue. Our findings call for more public health attention and societal support to be paid to twins and their families in low-income countries, given that twins are at higher risk of developmental challenges and health disadvantages.\nD.S.L. was supported by the European Union (ERC, BIOSFER, 101071773).

Dr Diamond is famous for revealing the truth about the unsuccessful effort to change a monozygotic male Canadian twin into a female, following accidental ablation of his penis during circumcision. A short summary of recent twin research on human sexuality and transsexuality, focused on Dr Diamond's contributions, is then presented. The tribute and overview are followed by research reviews involving the loss of a twin brother; oxytocin adminstration during twin delivery; models of monochorionic twinning; and twins' brain responses to watching films.

    "abstract": "This perspective discusses the convergence of digital twin (DT) technology and on-the-chip systems as pivotal innovations in precision medicine, substantially advancing drug discovery. DT leverages extensive health data to create dynamic virtual patient models, enabling predictive insights and optimized treatment strategies. Concurrently, on-the-chip systems from the Carbon world replicate human biological processes on microfluidic platforms, providing detailed insights into disease mechanisms and pharmacological interactions. The convergence of these technologies promises to revolutionize drug development by enhancing therapeutic precision, accelerating discovery timelines, and reducing costs. Specifically, it assesses their role in drug development, from refining therapeutic precision to expediting discovery timelines and reducing the final price. Nevertheless, integrating these technologies faces challenges, including data collection and privacy concerns, technical intricacies, and clinical adoption barriers. This manuscript argues for interdisciplinary cooperation to navigate these challenges, positing DTs and on-the-chip technologies as foundational elements in personalized healthcare and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins have recently emerged in healthcare. They combine advances in cyber-physical systems, modelling and computation techniques, and enable a bidirectional flow of information between the physical and virtual entities. In respiratory medicine, progress in connected devices and artificial intelligence make it technically possible to obtain digital twins that allow real-time visualisation of a patient's respiratory health. Advances in respiratory system modelling also enable the development of digital twins that could be used to predict the effectiveness of different therapeutic approaches for a patient. For researchers, digital twins could lead to a better understanding of the gene-environment-time interactions involved in the development of chronic respiratory diseases. For clinicians and patients, they could facilitate personalised and timely medicine, by enabling therapeutic adaptations specific to each patient and early detection of disease progression. The objective of this review is to allow the reader to explore the concept of digital twins, their feasibility in respiratory medicine, their potential benefits and the challenges to their implementation.",

    "abstract": "This State of the Future Review describes and discusses the potential transformative power of digital twins in cardiac electrophysiology. In this 'big picture' approach, we explore the evolution of mechanistic modelling based digital twins, their current and immediate clinical applications, and envision a future where continuous updates, advanced calibration, and seamless data integration redefine clinical practice of cardiac electrophysiology. Our aim is to inspire researchers and clinicians to embrace the extraordinary possibilities that digital twins offer in the pursuit of precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pelvic pain is a debilitating condition affecting quality of life. Endometriosis is one of the leading causes of CPP, but recent studies highlighted the role of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/PBS) in causing CPP. Only some studies addressed the coexistence of these two conditions, which seems more frequent than what is supposed, leading to diagnostic delays and unnecessary surgeries. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the estimate of the prevalence of the comorbidity of endometriosis and IC/PBS.\nWe performed a systematic review of the literature indexed on PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane using a combination of keywords and text words represented by \"painful bladder syndrome\", \"endometriosis\", \"interstitial cystitis\", and \"bladder pain syndrome\". We performed a meta-analysis of the results.\nThe meta-analysis shows that the coexistence of endometriosis and IC/PBS in women with CPP ranged from 15.5% to 78.3%, which is higher than the prevalence of IC/PBS in the general population.\nPrevalence data about the coexistence of endometriosis and IC/PBS are highly heterogeneous, probably due to the paucity of available data. However, in cases of endometriosis unresponsive to treatment, other reasons for CPP (such as IC/PBS) need to be ruled out.",

The clinical significance of umbilical artery iAREDF in appropriately grown monochorionic twins is not well described.\nThis is a single-institution retrospective cohort study describing characteristics and outcomes of monochorionic diamniotic twins with appropriate for gestational age growth and umbilical artery iAREDF in comparison to monochorionic diamniotic twins with selective fetal growth restriction and iAREDF,\u00a0or sFGR type III. The cohorts were compared for antenatal resolution of iAREDF, estimated gestational age at delivery, fetal and maternal complications, delivery characteristics, and survival outcomes.\nTen appropriately grown monochorionic diamniotic twin pairs with umbilical artery iAREDF and 23 with sFGR Type III delivered at a mean gestational age of 30.4 (\u00b1\u00a05) weeks and 30.7 (\u00b1\u00a04) weeks, respectively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.93).

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins are studied to understand genetic and environmental influences on complex traits, however the mechanisms behind twinning are not completely understood. (Epi)genomic studies identified SNPs associated with DZ twinning and DNA methylation sites with MZ twinning. To find molecular biomarkers of twinning, we compared transcriptomics and metabolomics data from MZ and DZ twins. We analyzed 42,663 RNA transcripts in 1453 MZ twins and 1294 DZ twins from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR), followed by sex-stratified analyses. The top 5% transcripts with lowest p-values were analyzed for replication in 217 MZ and 158 DZ twins from the older Finnish Twin cohort (FTC). In the NTR, one transcript (PURG) was significantly differentially expressed between MZ and DZ twins; but this did not replicate in FTC. Pathway analyses highlighted the WNT-pathway, previously associated with MZ twinning, and the TGF-B and SMAD pathway, previously associated with DZ twinning. Meta-analysis of 169 serum metabolites in 2797 MZ and 2040 DZ twins from the NTR, FTC and FinnTwin12, showed no metabolomic differences. Overall, we did not find replicable transcript-level expression differences in blood between MZ and DZ twins, but highlighted the TGF-B/SMAD pathway as a potential transcriptional biomarker for DZ twinning.",

    "abstract": "This case presents a unique age estimation involving Chinese Tibetan twins, where one of them has been arrested for alleged rape. His parents claimed he was about 13\u00a0years old without providing any official age documentation. Since age is important in criminal proceedings in China, bone age estimation was conducted to determine the chronological age of the twins. The twins underwent a physical examination, X-rays of the left hand/wrist, and pelvis, and a CT scan of the clavicle. Two age estimation standards in China were used: \"Skeletal Maturity and Assessment Methods of Hand and Wrist for Chinese\" (China-05 standard), and \"Technical Specifications for Skeletal Age Evaluation of Han Population Teenagers\" (TSSHPT standard). The bone radiographs showed that most of the twins' epiphyseal development was similar, with only slight differences observed in the distal radius, distal ulna, and iliac crest apophysis. The results of the two methods showed differences in the range of predicted ages. Applying the RUS-CHN method to hand/wrist images, the estimated age of the suspect was determined to be 16-16.5\u00a0years old, while his brother's age was 15.5-16\u00a0years old. Applying the TSSHPT standard to all three images, the estimated age of the suspect was 17-17.5\u00a0years old, while his brother's age was estimated to be 16.5-17\u00a0years old. In this case, two commonly used methods for age estimation were introduced. The disparity in age estimations using the RUS-CHN and TSSHPT standards, with the age of the suspect ranging from 16 to 17.5\u00a0years. This case revealed that the choice of bone age estimation method can significantly impact the result of estimated age, which has important implications for legal proceedings. Additionally, the minor differences in skeletal maturity between the twins emphasize the need to account for individual variations, even among genetically similar individuals. Furthermore, this case contributes to the broader discourse on the effectiveness of skeletal age estimation methods across diverse populations, underscoring the necessity for tailored evaluation standards that consider genetic and environmental diversity.",

    "abstract": "Almost one in five (18.8%) UK adolescents are estimated to self-harm and many young people initiate self-harm early (average age 13\u2009years). Prevention of self-harm should be informed by knowledge about risk factors (e.g. socio-demographic indices), characteristics (i.e. motivation for self-harm and help-seeking behaviours), as well as relative aetiological genetic and environmental processes. Previous twin studies evidence both genetic and environmental influences on self-harm. However, to date, there has been no genetically informed research on self-harm aetiology across development, nor studies identifying risk factors for initiating self-harm at a younger age.\nWe examined self-harm in the Twins Early Development Study, a birth cohort twin study. Using clustered regression models, we tested associations of socio-demographic factors and victimisation with lifetime self-harm and age of self-harm initiation, both reported at 21. To investigate stability and/or change in genetic and environmental influences on self-harm we interpreted a multivariate Cholesky decomposition across ages \u226416, 21, and 26.\nSelf-harm was more common in adolescence than early adulthood, and the incidence of self-harm in early adulthood was low (1.4%). The most common motivation for self-harm was 'to get relief from a terrible state of mind' (83.4%). Independent predictors of self-harm and earlier initiation of self-harm were being female, belonging to a gender and/or sexual minority group, and experience of bullying victimisation. Sexual minority status was still significantly associated with self-harm after controlling for familial factors in co-twin control analyses. The Cholesky decomposition showed stability in genetic influences and innovation in non-shared environmental influences on self-harm.\nAdolescence should be a key period for self-harm interventions. Women, sexual, and gender minorities, and those experiencing victimisation may need targeted support early in adolescence. Furthermore, it should be acknowledged that different individuals can be at risk at different stages as environmental factors influencing self-harm change across time.",

    "abstract": "Research on community (home or birth center) twin birth is scarce. This study evaluates outcomes of twin pregnancies entering care with a single community practitioner.\nThis is a retrospective observational cohort study of 100 consecutive twin pregnancies planning community births during a 12-year period. Outcomes measured included mode of birth; birth weights; Apgar scores; ante-, intra-, and post-partum transports; perineal integrity; birth interval; blood loss; chorionicity; weight concordance; and other maternal or neonatal morbidity.\n31 women (31%) transferred to a hospital-based clinician prior to labor. Of the 69 pregnancies still under the obstetrician's care when labor began, 79.7% (n = 55) were Dichorionic Diamniotic and 21.3% (n = 14) were Monochorionic Diamniotic. The vaginal birth rate was 91.3% (n = 63): 77.3% for primips and functional primips (no previous vaginal births) and 97.9% for multips. Six mothers (8.7%) had in-labor cesareans (1 multip and 5 primips). Rates of vaginal birth did not vary significantly by chorionicity. There were 8 transports in labor (11.6%): 2 vaginal and 6 cesareans. Average gestational age was 39.0 weeks (range 35-42). Compared to primiparas, multiparas had less perineal trauma and higher rates of vaginal birth and spontaneous vaginal birth. One twin infant and one mother required postpartum hospital transport. Of the babies born in a community setting, there was no serious morbidity requiring hospital treatment.\nA community birth can lead to high rates of vaginal birth and good outcomes for both mothers and babies in properly selected twin pregnancies. Community twin birth with midwifery style care under specific protocol guidelines and with a skilled practitioner may be a reasonable choice for women wishing to avoid a cesarean section-especially when there is no option of a hospital vaginal birth. Training all practitioners in vaginal twin and breech birth skills remains an imperative.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twins are at higher risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity, primarily due to pregnancy-related complications, such as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). We aimed to investigate whether amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) signals are different between monochorionic twins with and without TTTS.\nThis was a retrospective single-centre study conducted at Innsbruck Medical University Hospital, Austria. Preterm infants born before 32\u2009weeks of gestation between 6 November 2010 and 6 December 2022 were eligible. The aEEG was analysed for the total maturation score, its component scores and the number of sleep-wake cycles per hour.\nWe enrolled 79 monochorionic twin infants (48% male) and 157 dichorionic (62% male) twin infants. We found no differences between these two groups of preterm infants regarding the total maturation and component scores, or the number of sleep wake cycles. Monochorionic twins with TTTS showed significantly lower total maturation scores and individual component scores compared to monochorionic twins without TTTS.\nPreterm infants with TTTS showed differences in neonatal aEEG signals. Whether these differences are caused by prematurity-related or TTTS-related factors, such as hemodynamic and metabolic changes due to placental anastomoses, should be investigated in future prospective studies, to gain more insight into this important topic.",

Using 281 individual adult twins' DNA methylation data from the Louisville Twin Study, we performed an epigenome-wide analysis of loneliness to address this gap in the literature. In the discovery analysis, 169 twins were used to prioritize probes and test associations with DNA methylation age acceleration, and 56 independent monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs (112 individuals) were used in a within-family replication analysis. Among the 837,274 sites analyzed, no probe sites were statistically significant at the genome-wide level (",

    "abstract": "Numerical simulations of cardiovascular device deployment within digital twins of patient-specific anatomy can expedite and de-risk the device design process. Nonetheless, the exclusive use of patient-specific data constrains the anatomic variability that can be explored. We study how Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) can edit digital twins to create digital siblings. Siblings can serve as the basis for comparative simulations, which can reveal how subtle anatomic variations impact device deployment, and augment virtual cohorts for improved device assessment. Using a case example centered on cardiac anatomy, we study various methods to generate digital siblings. We specifically introduce anatomic variation at different spatial scales or within localized regions, demonstrating the existence of bias toward common anatomic features. We furthermore leverage this bias for virtual cohort augmentation through selective editing, addressing issues related to dataset imbalance and diversity. Our framework delineates the capabilities of diffusion models in synthesizing anatomic variation for numerical simulation studies.",

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disease caused by deficient lysosomal glycogen degradation, and includes both late-onset (LOPD) and severe infantile-onset (IOPD) phenotypes. Due to very small patient numbers in IOPD and the high phenotypic heterogeneity observed in this population, a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP)-based \"digital twin\" approach was developed to perform an in silico comparison of the efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa vs. the standard of care, in a virtual population of IOPD patients. A QSP model was developed that represents key elements of Pompe disease pathophysiology, including tissue glycogen accumulation and the elevation of the biomarker urine Hex4 in both LOPD and IOPD patients. In this approach, the QSP model was used to generate digital twins of each IOPD patient enrolled in the avalglucosidase alfa clinical program, considering their respective disease burden, demographics, and treatment history. This virtual cohort supplemented clinical observations by simulating and comparing tissue glycogen and urine Hex4 following avalglucosidase alfa treatment vs. the standard of care. The digital twin analysis supports the interpretation that the enhanced reduction in urine Hex4 observed following avalglucosidase alfa treatment is attributable to greater tissue glycogen clearance. Overall, this study provides mechanism-based insight into avalglucosidase alfa efficacy across the phenotypic spectrum of Pompe disease and demonstrates the value of applying a QSP-based digital twin analysis to support rare disease drug development.",

    "abstract": "Past studies indicate daily increases in estrogen across the menstrual cycle protect against binge-eating (BE) phenotypes (e.g. emotional eating), whereas increases in progesterone enhance risk. Two previous studies from our laboratory suggest these associations could be due to differential genomic effects of estrogen and progesterone. However, these prior studies were unable to directly model effects of daily changes in hormones on etiologic risk, instead relying on menstrual cycle phase or mean hormone levels. The current study used newly modified twin models to examine, for the first time, the effects of daily changes in estradiol and progesterone on genetic/environmental influences on emotional eating in our archival twin sample assessed across 45 consecutive days.\nParticipants included 468 female twins from the Michigan State University Twin Registry. Daily emotional eating was assessed with the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and daily saliva samples were assayed for ovarian hormone levels. Modified genotype \u00d7 environment interaction models examined daily changes in genetic/environmental effects across hormone levels.\nFindings revealed differential effects of daily changes in hormones on etiologic risk, with increasing genetic influences across progesterone levels, and increasing shared environmental influences at the highest estradiol levels. Results were consistent across primary analyses examining all study days and sensitivity analyses within menstrual cycle phases.\nFindings are significant in being the first to identify changes in etiologic risk for BE symptoms across daily hormone levels and highlighting novel mechanisms (e.g. hormone threshold effects, regulation of conserved genes) that may contribute to the etiology of BE.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis is the leading cause of death in patients with cancer, driving considerable scientific and clinical interest in immunosurveillance of micrometastases. We investigated this process by creating a multiscale mathematical model to study the interactions between the immune system and the progression of micrometastases in general epithelial tissue. We analyzed the parameter space of the model using high-throughput computing resources to generate over 100,000 virtual patient trajectories. We demonstrated that the model could recapitulate a wide variety of virtual patient trajectories, including uncontrolled growth, partial response, and complete immune response to tumor growth. We classified the virtual patients and identified key patient parameters with the greatest effect on the simulated immunosurveillance. We highlight the lessons derived from this analysis and their impact on the nascent field of cancer patient digital twins (CPDTs). While CPDTs could enable clinicians to systematically dissect the complexity of cancer in each individual patient and inform treatment choices, our work shows that key challenges remain before we can reach this vision. In particular, we show that there remain considerable uncertainties in immune responses, unreliable patient stratification, and unpredictable personalized treatment. Nonetheless, we also show that in spite of these challenges, patient-specific models suggest strategies to increase control of clinically undetectable micrometastases even without complete parameter certainty.",

    "abstract": "Dicephalic parapagus conjoined twins, a rarely occurring form of conjoined twinning has poor prognosis and remains a significant cause of perinatal deaths. Since majority of cases of conjoined twins are not compatible with life, early and reliable detection with diagnostic medical imaging remains crucial for adequate patient counselling, medical and surgical management. We present a case of dicephalic parapagus twin gestation with associated congenital anomalies detected for the first time with ultrasound in the third trimester in a 29-year-old pregnant woman. An initial first trimester ultrasound at 14 weeks gestational age was unremarkable. Ultrasound fetal anatomical survey in the third trimester remains reliable for the detection of rare fetal anomalies such as dicephalic parapagus twins that might have been missed in earlier scans. Continuous efforts should therefore be made for the inclusion of detailed anatomical survey in the early third trimester; particularly in women with unremarkable earlier ultrasound scans and in those reporting late for obstetric care.",

    "abstract": "To compare histopathological findings of placentas of dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies of in-vitro fertilization (IVF), conceived after fresh embryo transfer (ET) and frozen-thawed ET.\nThis retrospective study compared dichorionic diamniotic twin IVF pregnancies that resulted in livebirths during 2010-2022. The placental findings were classified according to definitions curated by the 2016 Amsterdam Placental Workshop Group Consensus Statement. A multivariate logistic analysis was constructed to estimate the odds ratios (OR) of placental histopathology abnormal findings, adjusted for maternal age, body mass index and nulliparity.\nThe mean gestational age at birth was lower following fresh ET pregnancies (n\u00a0=\u00a0236) than frozen-thawed ET pregnancies (n\u00a0=\u00a0122) (34.89 vs 35.77 weeks, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). For the fresh ET compared to the frozen-thawed ET group, rates were higher of preterm birth (69.5\u00a0% vs. 55.7\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011), low birthweight (71.6\u00a0% vs 57.4\u00a0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and very low birthweight (14.2\u00a0% vs 9.0\u00a0%, p value one sided\u00a0=\u00a00.029). For the fresh ET compared with the frozen-thawed ET group, the rates were higher of maternal vascular lesions (20.3\u00a0% vs. 11.5\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), placental hemorrhage (12.7\u00a0% vs. 7\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.021), and villous lesions related to maternal vascular lesions (7.2\u00a0% vs. 3.7\u00a0%, p value one sided\u00a0=\u00a00.04). A multivariate logistic analysis showed a higher risk of maternal or neonatal vascular lesions for twin pregnancies after fresh ET than frozen-thawed ET (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a01.91, 95\u00a0% CI 1.26-2.92, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011).\nFollowing fresh ET compared to frozen-thawed ET, obstetrical and neonatal outcomes were worse, and the risk of maternal vascular lesions was greater.",

    "abstract": "The global incidence of twin births has substantially increased in recent decades. Twin pregnancies are inherently associated with higher obstetric risks, often resulting in preterm birth and low birth weight, both of which frequently necessitate neonatal intensive care (NICU) interventions. Such interventions can significantly disrupt early breastfeeding practices, contributing to lower exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rates in twins as compared to singletons. This review examines the factors affecting optimal breastfeeding among twins and strategies for optimization. An extensive literature search was conducted across several databases focusing on breastfeeding twins and related factors. A total of 256 studies on breastfeeding among twins were identified. Additionally, relevant reviews, guidelines, and support materials from twin associations and organizations were examined to identify factors affecting optimal breastfeeding and to highlight strategies for enhancing breastfeeding success. Studies highlight factors affecting optimal breastfeeding among twins, including low milk supply, fatigue, lack of knowledge, anxiety, stress, limited support, breastfeeding reluctance, breast problems, maternal illness, twin prematurity, and NICU admission. Suggested strategies to optimize breastfeeding outcomes include educational support, expressing breastmilk for preterm twins, establishing routines, correct techniques, varied positions, comfort devices, family support, using resources from twin associations, community engagement, and promoting early initiation and EBF. Although factors affecting breastfeeding among twins have been studied, few studies provide strong evidence or statistically determine these issues, and also, interventions are not tailored to individual needs. Studies focusing on personalized interventions are needed to improve breastfeeding outcomes for mothers of twins.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins (DTs) are an emerging capability in additive manufacturing (AM), set to revolutionize design optimization, inspection, in situ monitoring, and root cause analysis. AM DTs typically incorporate multimodal data streams, ranging from machine toolpaths and in-process imaging to X-ray CT scans and performance metrics. Despite the evolution of DT platforms, challenges remain in effectively inspecting them for actionable insights, either individually or in a multidisciplinary, geographically distributed team setting. Quality assurance, manufacturing departments, pilot labs, and plant operations must collaborate closely to reliably produce parts at scale. This is particularly crucial in AM where complex structures require a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach. Additionally, the large-scale data originating from different modalities and their inherent 3D nature pose significant hurdles for traditional 2D desktop-based inspection methods. To address these challenges and increase the value proposition of DTs, we introduce a novel virtual reality (VR) framework to facilitate collaborative and real-time inspection of DTs in AM. This framework includes advanced features for intuitive alignment and visualization of multimodal data, visual occlusion management, streaming large-scale volumetric data, and collaborative tools, substantially improving the inspection of AM components and processes to fully exploit the potential of DTs in AM.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins represent a key technology for precision health. Medical digital twins consist of computational models that represent the health state of individual patients over time, enabling optimal therapeutics and forecasting patient prognosis. Many health conditions involve the immune system, so it is crucial to include its key features when designing medical digital twins. The immune response is complex and varies across diseases and patients, and its modelling requires the collective expertise of the clinical, immunology, and computational modelling communities. This review outlines the initial progress on immune digital twins and the various initiatives to facilitate communication between interdisciplinary communities. We also outline the crucial aspects of an immune digital twin design and the prerequisites for its implementation in the clinic. We propose some initial use cases that could serve as \"proof of concept\" regarding the utility of immune digital technology, focusing on diseases with a very different immune response across spatial and temporal scales (minutes, days, months, years). Lastly, we discuss the use of digital twins in drug discovery and point out emerging challenges that the scientific community needs to collectively overcome to make immune digital twins a reality.",

    "abstract": "Familial dietary intake can be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors; the current study aimed to examine the role of these two factors on dietary intake by investigating the resemblance in energy, nutrient, and food group intake among spouses and siblings in twin and family-based studies.\nThe online literature databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched up to September 2024. The pooled correlation coefficient (r) of studies was calculated using Fisher's z and standard error (SE) of z's of all studies and our final results were reported in six groups including non-twin siblings, monozygotic (MZ) twins, dizygotic (DZ) twins, all-twins, all siblings, and spouse.\nOur findings on 30 observational studies indicate that siblings, especially MZ twins, tend to have similar dietary intake, with high correlations for vegetables (r: 0.59), red meat (r: 0.58), and fruits (r: 0.56). Among DZ twins, the lowest correlations were observed for eggs (r: 0.07), soft drinks (r: 0.14), and daily intake of simple carbohydrates (r: 0.17). DZ twins did not show significant differences in dietary resemblance compared to non-twin siblings. Among spouses, the highest correlations for dietary intake were found for polyunsaturated fats (r: 0.41), saturated fats (r: 0.40), and total fats (r: 0.39), while the lowest correlation was for protein intake (r: 0.24).\nWhile the greatest similarity in dietary intake was observed among MZ twins, no significant difference in dietary intake similarity was noted between DZ twins and non-twin siblings. Furthermore, spouses exhibited a significant degree of similarity in their dietary consumption. Therefore, dietary intake is shaped by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, warranting further investigation to validate these observations.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of umbilical cord entanglement (UCE) by ultrasound (US) in monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA) twins in the second and third trimesters is common. However, only a few cases have been reported on the diagnosis of UCE as early as the first trimester. Herein, we report a case of the earliest-ever sonographic diagnosis of UCE and demonstrate the feasibility of its diagnosis by US.\nA 32-year-old gravida 2 para 1 woman conceived after assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment. In transvaginal US examination at 8.5 gestational weeks, two embryos with regular heartbeats in the same amniotic sac and with only one yolk sac were demonstrated. The fetal crown-rump lengths were 20 and 21\u00a0mm, appropriate for 8.4 and 8.5 gestational weeks, respectively. HD-flow power Doppler 2D and 3D US demonstrated two tightly entangled umbilical cords of the two fetuses. Spectral Doppler US showed two different heart rates (162 and 167 beats per minute) and blood flow in opposite directions from the point of entanglement of the two umbilical cords. This was consistent with a diagnosis of a first-trimester MCMA pregnancy with UCE. Missed abortion of the two embryos was diagnosed by US examination at 10.5 weeks, and the pregnancy was terminated by dilatation and curettage without further complications.\nUCE in the first trimester may occur as early as eight gestational weeks, and its diagnosis by ultrasound is feasible. UCE diagnosed in the first trimester may be a poor prognostic factor.",

    "abstract": "Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate is increased in formerly small-for-gestational age singletons and in smaller twins compared to their normal-weight co-twin. Less is known concerning other adrenal hormones. We compared diurnal salivary profiles in monozygotic twins with intra-twin birthweight (bw) differences to analyse the long-term impact of bw and persistent intra-twin auxological differences on various adrenal hormones.\nForty-six monozygotic pre-pubertal twin pairs with bw difference of <1 standard deviation score (SDS) (concordant; n = 29, 13 female) and \u22651 SDS (discordant; n = 17, 6 female) were recruited. At a mean age of 6.9 years, saliva samples were collected (7:00 a.m./waking, 1:00 p.m., 6:00 p.m., and 9:00 p.m.) and analysed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.\nDiurnal salivary concentrations showed significant intra-twin correlations in all twin pairs for nearly all time points: progesterone and androstenedione (4/4 time points), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (2/4). However, in the discordant group, mean progesterone differed significantly (p = 0.018) between the smaller (3.27 nmol/L, SD 3.87) and the larger twin (0.72 nmol/L, SD 0.42) at 7:00 a.m., and intra-twin differences were observed at 3/4 time points. Regression analyses of intra-twin differences confirmed that actual hormonal parameters were explained mainly by the co-twin parameter. However, at 6:00 p.m., progesterone concentration of the smaller twin was explained by bw (\u0392 -1.102; SE 0.563; p = 0.05) and actual weight (\u0392 0.799; SE 0.327; p = 0.019).\nThe significant correlations within monozygotic twin pairs in all measured hormones at nearly all time points suggest a strong genetic influence on the adrenal axis. Among the discordant twin pairs, we found significant variations in progesterone, suggesting additional long-lasting influence from intrauterine conditions on adrenal hormones with possible metabolic consequences.",

However, in the discordant group, mean progesterone differed significantly (p = 0.018) between the smaller (3.27 nmol/L, SD 3.87) and the larger twin (0.72 nmol/L, SD 0.42) at 7:00 a.m., and intra-twin differences were observed at 3/4 time points. Regression analyses of intra-twin differences confirmed that actual hormonal parameters were explained mainly by the co-twin parameter. However, at 6:00 p.m., progesterone concentration of the smaller twin was explained by bw (\u0392 -1.102; SE 0.563; p = 0.05) and actual weight (\u0392 0.799; SE 0.327; p = 0.019).",

    "abstract": "A Digital Twin (DT) can be understood as a representation of a real asset, a virtual replica of a physical object, process, or even a system. They have been used in managing healthcare facilities, streamlining care processes, personalizing treatments, and enhancing patient recovery. The potential impact of this tool on our society and its well-being is quite significant. A quick review of the literature was carried out using the terms ('Digital Twins') and ('Digital Health'), and (Health Care) with a time interval of up to 5\u2009years (2018-23). Using the PRISMA Method, the search was conducted in six academic databases: IEEE Xplore, Dimensions, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and ACM. After applying the search strings and the exclusion criteria, a total of 13 publications were identified and listed to constitute and support the discussion of this article. The selected studies were categorized into 2 groups according to their application in healthcare: A group of clinical applications, subdivided into topics on personalized care and reproduction of biological structures and another group of operational applications, subdivided into topics such as optimization of operational processes, reproduction of physical structures, and development of devices and drugs. The use of DT in healthcare presents important challenges related to data integration, privacy, and interoperability. However, trends indicate exciting potential in personalizing treatment, prevention, remote monitoring, informed decision-making, and process management, which can result in significant improvements in quality and efficiency in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins (DTHs) and virtual twins (VTHs) in healthcare represent emerging technologies towards precision medicine, providing opportunities for patient-centric healthcare. Our scoping review aimed to map the current DTH and VTH technologies in oncology, summarize their technical solutions, and assess their credibility. A systematic search was conducted in the main bibliographic databases, identifying 441 records, of which 30 were included. The studies covered a wide range of cancers, including breast, lung, colorectal, and gastrointestinal malignancies, with DTH and VTH applications focusing on diagnosis, therapy, and monitoring. The results revealed heterogeneity in targeted topics, technical approaches, and outcomes. Most twining solutions use synthetic or limited real-world data, raising concerns regarding their reliability. Few studies have integrated real-time data and machine learning for predictive modeling. Technical challenges include data integration, scalability, and ethical considerations, such as data privacy and security. Moreover, the evidence lacks sufficient clinical validation, with only partial credibility in most cases. Our findings underscore the need for multidisciplinary collaboration among end-users and developers to address the technical and ethical challenges of DTH and VTH systems. Although promising for the future of personalized oncology, substantial steps are required to move beyond experimental frameworks and to achieve clinical implementation.",

    "abstract": "This review examines the significant influence of Digital Twins (DTs) and their variant, Digital Human Twins (DHTs), on the healthcare field. DTs represent virtual replicas that encapsulate both medical and physiological characteristics-such as tissues, organs, and biokinetic data-of patients. These virtual models facilitate a deeper understanding of disease progression and enhance the customization and optimization of treatment plans by modeling complex interactions between genetic factors and environmental influences. By establishing dynamic, bidirectional connections between the DTs of physical objects and their digital counterparts, these technologies enable real-time data exchange, thereby transforming electronic health records. Leveraging the increasing availability of extensive historical datasets from clinical trials and real-world sources, AI models can now generate comprehensive predictions of future health outcomes for specific patients in the form of AI-generated DTs. Such models can also offer insights into potential diagnoses, disease progression, and treatment responses. This remarkable progression in healthcare paves the way for precision medicine and personalized health, allowing for high-level individualized medical interventions and therapies. However, the integration of DTs into healthcare faces several challenges, including data security, accessibility, bias, and quality. Addressing these obstacles is crucial to realizing the full potential of DHTs, heralding a new era of personalized, precise, and accurate medicine.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise for revolutionizing healthcare. This narrative review focuses on the evolving discussion of the utility of AI and clinical informatics in critical care and acute care medicine, specifically focusing on digital twin (DT) technology. The improved computational power and iterative validation of these intelligent tools have enhanced medical education, in silico research, and clinical decision support in critical care settings. Integrating DTs into critical care opens vast opportunities, but simultaneously poses complex challenges, from data safety and privacy concerns to potentially increasing healthcare disparities. In medicine, DTs can significantly improve the efficiency of critical care systems. Stakeholder investment is essential for successful implementation and integration of these technologies.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic interaction between genomic DNA, epigenetic modifications, and phenotypic traits was examined in identical twins. Environmental perturbations can induce epigenetic changes in DNA methylation, influencing gene expression and phenotypes. Although DNA methylation mediates gene-environment correlations, the quantitative effects of external factors on DNA methylation remain underexplored. This study aimed to quantify these effects using a novel approach.\nA cohort study was conducted on healthy monozygotic twins to evaluate the influence of environmental stimuli on DNA methylation. We developed the Environmental Factor Index (EFI) to identify methylation sites showing statistically significant changes in response to environmental stimuli. We analyzed the identified sites for associations with disorders, DNA methylation markers, and CpG islands.\nThe EFI identified methylation sites that exhibited significant associations with genes linked to various disorders, particularly cancer. These sites were overrepresented on CpG islands compared to other genomic features, highlighting their regulatory importance.\nThe EFI is a valuable tool for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis. It provides insights into the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies and offers a new perspective on the role of environmental factors in epigenetic regulation.",

    "abstract": "Urban Digital Twins (UDTs) have become the new buzzword for researchers, planners, policymakers, and industry experts when it comes to designing, planning, and managing sustainable and efficient cities. It encapsulates the last iteration of the technocratic and ultra-efficient, post-modernist vision of smart cities. However, while more applications branded as UDTs appear around the world, its conceptualization remains ambiguous. Beyond being technically prescriptive about what UDTs are, this article focuses on their aspects of interaction and operationalization in connection to people in cities, and how enhanced by metaverse ideas they can deepen societal divides by offering divergent urban experiences based on different stakeholder preferences. Therefore, firstly this article repositions the term UDTs by comparing existing concrete and located applications that have a focus on interaction and participation, including some that may be closer to the concept of UDT than is commonly assumed. Based on the components found separately in the different studied cases, it is possible to hypothesize about possible future, more advanced realizations of UDTs. This enables us to contrast their positive and negative societal impacts. While the development of new immersive interactive digital worlds can improve planning using collective knowledge for more inclusive and diverse cities, they pose significant risks not only the common ones regarding privacy, transparency, or fairness, but also social fragmentation based on urban digital multiplicities. The potential benefits and challenges of integrating this multiplicity of UDTs into participatory urban governance emphasize the need for human-centric approaches to promote socio-technical frameworks able to mitigate risks as social division.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the risk factors influencing very early preterm and early preterm births in twin pregnancies after in\u00a0vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). This retrospective study analyzed 2042 twin pregnancies that underwent embryo transfer via IVF/ICSI at the Reproductive Center of Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital between January 2019 and December 2022. Spontaneous very early, early preterm, and provider-initiated preterm births were examined separately. Based on gestational age, participants were categorized into three groups: very early preterm birth (<28\u2009weeks), early preterm birth (\u226528 to <34\u2009weeks), and ongoing pregnancy (\u226534\u2009weeks). Univariate analysis was conducted to assess general conditions, among the three groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for very early and early spontaneous preterm birth in twin pregnancies. A total of 2042 twin pregnancies were included in the study, with birth rates of 4.36% (89 of 2042) <28\u2009weeks, 12.14% (248 of 2042) \u226528 to <34\u2009weeks, and 83.50% (1705 of 2042) \u226534\u2009weeks. The primary cause of provider-initiated preterm birth <28\u2009weeks was placental factors, while hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (31.11%) were the predominant cause for preterm births \u226528 to <34\u2009weeks. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified the independent risk factors for births <28\u2009weeks (P\u2009<\u20090.05) as cervical cerclage, history of late miscarriage or premature birth, uterine adhesions, primary infertility of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), monochorionic pregnancies, history of cervical surgery, uterine malformations, body mass index \u226525\u2009kg/m",

    "abstract": "Twins suffer a disproportionately higher burden of adverse perinatal outcomes than singletons. However, the degree to which preterm delivery shapes the relationship between abruption and perinatal mortality in twins is unknown. Through causal mediation decomposition, we examine how preterm delivery mediates the effect of abruption on perinatal mortality among twins using the US-matched multiple birth data (1995-2000). We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) from Cox models with gestational age as the timescale. We decomposed the total effect (TE) into counterfactual natural direct (NDE) and natural indirect (NIE) effects. 557,220 matched twin births, 1.3% (n\u2009=\u20097032) resulted in abruption with higher perinatal mortality rates than non-abruption births (143 versus 36 per 1000 births, respectively) and a 4.53-fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.23, 4.82) increased hazard of perinatal mortality. HRs for NDE and NIE were 3.05 (95% CI: 2.84, 3.24) and 1.49 (95% CI: 1.49, 1.47, 1.50), respectively, and the proportion mediated (PM) was 41%. PM increased as the gestational age at delivery decreased. Associations persisted after correction for unmeasured confounders. The best strategies to improve perinatal delivery are delivery when abruption complicates twin pregnancies at term gestations and expectant management (avoiding early preterm delivery), if feasible, when abruption complicates twin pregnancies at preterm gestations.",

    "abstract": "Commonly, quantitative gait analysis post-stroke is performed in fully equipped laboratories housing costly technologies for quantitative evaluation of a patient's movement capacity. Combining such technologies with an electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal model can estimate muscle force properties non-invasively, offering clinicians insights into motor impairment mechanisms. However, lab-constrained areas and time-demanding sensor setup and data processing limit the practicality of these technologies in routine clinical care. We presented wearable technology featuring a multi-channel EMG-sensorized garment and an automated muscle localization technique. This allows unsupervised computation of muscle-specific activations, combined with five inertial measurement units (IMUs) for assessing joint kinematics and kinetics during various walking speeds. Finally, the wearable system was combined with a person-specific EMG-driven musculoskeletal model (referred to as human digital twins), enabling the quantitative assessment of movement capacity at a muscle-tendon level. This human digital twin facilitates the estimation of ankle dorsi-plantar flexion torque resulting from individual muscle-tendon forces. Results demonstrate the wearable technology's capability to extract joint kinematics and kinetics. When combined with EMG signals to drive a musculoskeletal model, it yields reasonable estimates of ankle dorsi-plantar flexion torques (",

    "abstract": "Digital twin technology, pioneered for engineering applications, is being adapted to biomedicine and healthcare; however, several problems need to be solved in the process. One major problem is that of dynamically calibrating a computational model to an individual patient, using data collected from that patient over time. This kind of calibration is crucial for improving model-based forecasts and realizing personalized medicine. The underlying computational model often focuses on a particular part of human biology, combines different modeling paradigms at different scales, and is both stochastic and spatially heterogeneous. A commonly used modeling framework is that of an agent-based model, a computational model for simulating autonomous agents such as cells, which captures how system-level properties are affected by local interactions. There are no standard personalization methods that can be readily applied to such models. The key challenge for any such algorithm is to bridge the gap between the clinically measurable quantities (the macrostate) and the fine-grained data at different physiological scales which are required to run the model (the microstate). In this paper we develop an algorithm which applies a classic data assimilation technique, the ensemble Kalman filter, at the macrostate level. We then link the Kalman update at the macrostate level to an update at the microstate level that produces microstates which are not only compatible with desired macrostates but also highly likely with respect to model dynamics.",

We aimed to assess the impact of mixed reality visualization of the intracardiac anatomy on surgical decision-making in patients with complex heart defects.\nBetween September 2020 and December 2022, we recruited 50 patients and generated anatomic digital twins and visualized them in mixed reality. These anatomic digital twins were presented to the heart team after initial decisions were made using standard visualization methods. Changes in the surgical strategy were recorded. Additionally, heart team members rated their mixed reality experience through a questionnaire, and post-operative outcomes were registered. Anatomic digital twins changed the initially decided upon surgical strategies for 68% of cases. While artificial intelligence facilitated the rapid creation of digital anatomic twins, manual corrections were always necessary.\nIn conclusion, mixed reality anatomic digital twins added information to standard visualization methods and significantly influenced surgical planning, with evidence that these strategies can be implemented safely without additional risk.",

    "abstract": "Surface rendering of diagnostic imaging data can reveal hidden conditions with an almost life-like realism. However, early gestation images alone are often insufficient to accurately predict postnatal anatomy. Yet, time-sensitive decisions may have to be made before detailed imaging becomes possible. In this case series, we evaluate how combining medical illustration with cross-sectional diagnostic imaging can enhance the accuracy and clinical value of early visualization of conjoined twins.\nEarly gestation magnetic resonance imaging scans underwent semiautomated computerized post hoc manipulation to allow the medical illustrator to create the most effective images of the twins.\nFour sets of conjoined twins were diagnosed before 17 weeks. Surface modeling allowed spatial manipulation of the twins to highlight their anatomic connections. Further volumetric enhancement and critical interpretation of the models assisted the illustrator in creating life-like, accurate images of the twins. These illustrations allowed parents to visualize the likely presentation at birth and helped the multidisciplinary team to plan postnatal management.\nSurface rendering and surface modeling can be combined with medical illustration to create realistic, informative images of developing fetuses, using a level of detail that is tailored to the intended audience. This may be particularly useful in visualizing complex anomalies like conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "The identification of risk factors is crucial for the clinical prevention and diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Monochorionic twins (MCT), due to the high genetic homogeneity, provided a valuable model for investigating the risk factors of various diseases. This study aimed to explore the risk factors for NEC using MCT.\nA retrospective review was conducted on the medical records of monochorionic twins (MCT) treated at Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center from January 2012 to March 2023. We compared perinatal condition, feeding and preceding condition between MCT pairs with NEC (NEC MCT) and without NEC(No NEC MCT).Logistic regression analysis was utilized to identify independent risk factors.\nIn 85 pairs of monochorionic twins (MCT), NEC occurred in one twin in 78.8% of cases, whereas both twins were affected in 21.2% of cases. In the final cohort of 60 pairs of MCT, several parameters were found to differ significantly between NEC MCT group and No NEC MCT group. Compared to No NEC MCT group, the incidence of umbilical cord abnormalities was significantly higher in the NEC MCT group (25% vs. 8.3%, P\u2009=\u20090.014). Meanwhile, NEC MCT group showed higher prevalence of SGA infants (48.3% vs. 21.7%, P\u2009=\u20090.002) and sFGR (38.3% vs. 6.7%, P\u2009=\u20090.000). Furthermore, TTTs (13.3% vs. 3.3%, P\u2009=\u20090.027) and septicemia (25% vs. 5%, P\u2009=\u20090.002) were more common in NEC MCT group. In a multivariable logistic regression model, sFGR (OR 6.81,95%CI 2.1-21.9, p\u2009=\u20090.001) was eventually output as an independent risk factor.\nNon-genetic factors play a predominant role in the pathogenesis of NEC. Umbilical cord abnormalities, SGA, sFGR, TTTs and septicemia significantly increase the risk of NEC. sFGR is an independent risk factor of NEC.",

    "abstract": "The intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery, an indicator of subclinical atherosclerosis, varies in close association with various factors such as diabetes and immune response. The extent of changes in IMT varies among individuals owing to both genetic and epigenetic factors. In this study, we aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNA methylation patterns that affect carotid IMT in monozygotic (MZ) twins.\nWe measured the maximum IMT (IMT-Cmax) and the mean IMT in the common carotid artery wall using ultrasonography in 107 pairs of MZ twins recruited from the Osaka University Twin Registry. The genotyping of SNPs and the measurement of methylation levels were performed using a beads array, and the expression of each gene was determined by RNA sequencing. Linear regression analysis was performed on each of the two groups: one group consisted of twins randomly selected from each pair, and the other group consisted of co-twins.\nWe identified a CpG site (cg02432467) on HS3ST6 as a significant epigenetic factor in both IMT-Cmax and mean IMT analyses. The methylation level at another site (cg07927379) was negatively correlated with LINC01006 expression and IMT-Cmax. Furthermore, there were significant differences in AP2A2 expression and mean IMT among individuals with each genotype of the rs10902263 polymorphism.\nWe identified genetic and epigenetic factors associated with carotid IMT that may be useful for individualized assessments.",

We reported ophthalmic findings in a Chinese family with monozygotic twins with KC to describe the clinical features and identify genetic variants.\nComprehensive ophthalmic clinical assessments and examinations, including history, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, best-corrected visual acuity, corneal topography, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, and corneal biomechanics, were carried out on the twins and their parents. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to identify variants in this family. SIFT, PolyPhen2, MutationTaster, and CADD were used to predict the effect of amino acid substitutions on the affected protein.\nThe twins presented typical KC features. However, their mother did not meet the criteria for a KC diagnosis but exhibited KC subclinical manifestations. After screening, 12 potentially pathogenic variants in 10 genes were identified in both twins and emerged as candidate variants for this family. These genes included 1 previously reported KC-associated variant (ZNF469, c.4384\u2009G>A); 8 variants in 6 KC-associated genes (GRHPR, c.337\u2009G>A, c.862_863del; COL6A1, c.920\u2009G>A; FLG, c.8753C>G; HSPG2, c.9503C>T; KRT82, c.1306\u2009G>A; SCN9A, c.5702_5706del, c.641\u2009G>A); and 3 variants in 3 non-KC-associated genes (PDE6G, c.6C>A; HAL, c.1724C>T; AGBL1, c.2381\u2009G>A).\nThe accumulation of these potentially pathogenic variants in twins may have caused KC in these twins. These results expand the spectrum of KC candidate variants and provide a basis for further studies on KC.",

    "abstract": "The concept of digital twins, widely adopted in industry, is entering health care. However, there is a lack of consensus on what constitutes the digital twin of a patient.\nThe objective of this scoping review was to analyze definitions and characteristics of patient digital twins being developed for clinical use, as reported in the scientific literature.\nWe searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, IEEE, and Google Scholar for studies claiming digital twin development or evaluation until August 2023. Data on definitions, characteristics, and development phase were extracted. Unsupervised classification of claimed digital twins was performed.\nWe identified 86 papers representing 80 unique claimed digital twins, with 98% (78/80) in preclinical phases. Among the 55 papers defining \"digital twin,\" 76% (42/55) described a digital replica, 42% (23/55) mentioned real-time updates, 24% (13/55) emphasized patient specificity, and 15% (8/55) included 2-way communication. Among claimed digital twins, 60% (48/80) represented specific organs (primarily heart: 15/48, 31%; bones or joints: 10/48, 21%; lung: 6/48, 12%; and arteries: 5/48, 10%); 14% (11/80) embodied biological systems such as the immune system; and 26% (21/80) corresponded to other products (prediction models, etc). The patient data used to develop and run the claimed digital twins encompassed medical imaging examinations (35/80, 44% of publications), clinical notes (15/80, 19% of publications), laboratory test results (13/80, 16% of publications), wearable device data (12/80, 15% of publications), and other modalities (32/80, 40% of publications). Regarding data flow between patients and their virtual counterparts, 16% (13/80) claimed that digital twins involved no flow from patient to digital twin, 73% (58/80) used 1-way flow from patient to digital twin, and 11% (9/80) enabled 2-way data flow between patient and digital twin. Based on these characteristics, unsupervised classification revealed 3 clusters: simulation patient digital twins in 54% (43/80) of publications, monitoring patient digital twins in 28% (22/80) of publications, and research-oriented models unlinked to specific patients in 19% (15/80) of publications. Simulation patient digital twins used computational modeling for personalized predictions and therapy evaluations, mostly for one-time assessments, and monitoring digital twins harnessed aggregated patient data for continuous risk or outcome forecasting and care optimization.\nWe propose defining a patient digital twin as \"a viewable digital replica of a patient, organ, or biological system that contains multidimensional, patient-specific information and informs decisions\" and to distinguish simulation and monitoring digital twins. These proposed definitions and subtypes offer a framework to guide research into realizing the potential of these personalized, integrative technologies to advance clinical care.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins offer a new and exciting framework that has recently attracted significant interest in fields such as oncology, immunology, and cardiology. The basic idea of a digital twin is to combine simulation and learning to create a virtual model of a physical object. In this paper, we explore how the concept of digital twins can be generalized into a broader, overarching field. From a theoretical standpoint, this generalization is achieved by recognizing that the duality of a digital twin fundamentally connects complexity science with data science, leading to the emergence of complexity data science as a synthesis of the two. We examine the broader implications of this field, including its historical roots, challenges, and opportunities.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to explore the potential of digital twin technologies in orthopaedics and to evaluate how their integration with artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) can improve orthopaedic evaluation and treatment. This review addresses key applications of digital twins, including surgical planning, patient-specific outcome prediction, augmented reality-assisted surgery and simulation-based surgical training.\nExisting studies on digital twins in various domains, including engineering, biomedical and orthopaedics are reviewed. We also reviewed advancements in AI and DL relevant to digital twins. We focused on identifying key benefits, challenges and future directions for the implementation of digital twins in orthopaedic practice.\nThe review highlights that digital twins offer significant potential to revolutionise orthopaedic care by enabling precise surgical planning, real-time outcome prediction and enhanced training. Digital twins can model patient-specific anatomy using advanced imaging techniques and dynamically update with real-time data, providing valuable insights during surgery and postoperative care. However, challenges such as the need for large-scale data sets, technological limitations and integration issues must be addressed to fully realise these benefits.\nDigital twins represent a promising frontier in orthopaedic research and practice, with the potential to improve patient outcomes and enhance surgical precision. To enable widespread adoption, future research must focus on overcoming current challenges and further refining the integration of digital twins with AI and DL technologies.\nLevel V.",

Medical records of all preterm newborns (<37 weeks of gestation) with respiratory distress syndrome treated in a two-year period were reviewed. The birth order of twins, gestational age and mortality were analysed.\nOut of 809 preterm newborns, 104 (12.9%) were twins. Median gestational age at birth was 30.3 (IQR 31.4-34.2) weeks. Respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed in 525 (64.9 %) preterm newborns, of which 441 singletons and 84 twins. Prevalence of respiratory distress syndrome in first-born twins was not significantly higher compared with singletons, 67.3% (35/52) vs. 62.6 % (441/705), respectively (p=0.06). Prevalence of respiratory distress syndrome in second-born twins was 94.2 % (49/52), which was significantly higher compared with both singletons and first-born twins (p<0.001).

    "abstract": "To date, the public health system has been impacted by the increasing costs of many diagnostic and therapeutic pathways due to limited resources. At the same time, we are constantly seeking to improve these paths through approaches aimed at personalized medicine. To achieve the required levels of diagnostic and therapeutic precision, it is necessary to integrate data from different sources and simulation platforms. Today, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and predictive computer models are more efficient at guiding decisions regarding better therapies and medical procedures. The evolution of these multiparametric and multimodal systems has led to the creation of digital twins (DTs). The goal of our review is to summarize AI applications in discovering new immunotherapies and developing predictive models for more precise immunotherapeutic decision-making. The findings from this literature review highlight that DTs, particularly predictive mathematical models, will be pivotal in advancing healthcare outcomes. Over time, DTs will indeed bring the benefits of diagnostic precision and personalized treatment to a broader spectrum of patients.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that abnormal DNA methylation patterns may play a role in the progression of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). However, the mechanisms underlying the influence of DNA methylation on curve severity remain largely unknown.\nTo characterize the DNA methylation profiles associated with the curve severity of AIS.\nRetrospective study with prospectively collected clinical data and blood samples.\nA total of 7 AIS monozygotic twin pairs discordant for curve severity were included. Genome-wide methylation profile from blood samples were quantified by Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (850K chip). Cell type composition of the samples was estimated by RefbaseEWAS method. Differentially methylated CpG sites were identified through comparison between patients with low and high Cobb angle. We also performed a gene-based collapsing analysis using mCSEA by aggregating the CpG sites based on promoter region. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis were performed using clusterProfiler package.\nGenome-wide DNA methylation analysis identified multiple differentially methylated positions across the genome. Gene-based collapsing analysis identified 212 differentially methylated genes (FDR adjusted p<.05), most of which (186/212) were hypermethylated in the group with high Cobb angle. Some of the identified genes were well-documented in AIS literature, such as TBX1, PAX3 and LBX1. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were involved in pattern specification process, skeletal development, muscle function, neurotransmission and several signaling pathways (cAMP, Wnt and prolactin).\nThe study represents the largest systematic epigenomic analyses of monozygotic twins discordant for curve severity and supports the important role of altered DNA methylation in AIS.\nThe identified CpG sites provide insight into novel biomarkers predicting curve progression of AIS. Furthermore, the differentially methylated genes and enriched pathways may serve as interventional therapy target for AIS patients.",

    "abstract": "Cancer exhibits substantial heterogeneity, manifesting as distinct morphological and molecular variations across tumors, which frequently undermines the efficacy of conventional oncological treatments. Developments in multiomics and sequencing technologies have paved the way for unraveling this heterogeneity. Nevertheless, the complexity of the data gathered from these methods cannot be fully interpreted through multimodal data analysis alone. Mathematical modeling plays a crucial role in delineating the underlying mechanisms to explain sources of heterogeneity using patient-specific data. Intra-tumoral diversity necessitates the development of precision oncology therapies utilizing multiphysics, multiscale mathematical models for cancer. This review discusses recent advancements in computational methodologies for precision oncology, highlighting the potential of cancer digital twins to enhance patient-specific decision-making in clinical settings. We review computational efforts in building patient-informed cellular and tissue-level models for cancer and ",

    "abstract": "Interest in the concept of a virtual human model that can encompass human physiology and anatomy on a biophysical (mechanistic) basis, and can assist with the clinical diagnosis and treatment of disease, appears to be growing rapidly around the globe. When such models are personalised and coupled with continual diagnostic measurements, they are called 'digital twins'. We argue here that the most useful form of virtual human model will be one that is constrained by the laws of physics, contains a comprehensive knowledge graph of all human physiology and anatomy, is multiscale in the sense of linking systems physiology down to protein function, and can to some extent be personalized and linked directly with clinical records. We discuss current progress from the IUPS Physiome Project and the requirements for a framework to achieve such a model.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric cases of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD, formerly termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are a troubling new outcome of the pediatric obesity epidemic. Advising patients and families with this condition is challenging considering the nutrition needed to sustain developmentally appropriate growth in youth. Describing risk factors, comorbidities, management, and referrals for MASLD could improve surveillance and outcomes for this condition. MASLD is commonly seen with other comorbidities such as dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, anxiety, and depression. Considerations of epigenetics, diabetes, and adverse childhood experiences will be explored as additional underlying contributors to MASLD. Screening patients for this condition in conjunction with other comorbidities is essential to preventing the progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis, as well as lowering the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. This fraternal twin case report describes pertinent diagnostics, recommendations for referrals, follow-up consultations, and red flags for more advanced liver disease.",

    "abstract": "A key component in developing atrial digital twins (ADT) - virtual representations of patients' atria - is the accurate prescription of myocardial fibers which are essential for the tissue characterization. Due to the difficulty of reconstructing atrial fibers from medical imaging, a widely used strategy for fiber generation in ADT relies on mathematical models. Existing methodologies utilze semi-automatic approaches, are tailored to specific morphologies, and lack rigorous validation against imaging fiber data. In this study, we introduce a novel atrial Laplace-Dirichlet-Rule-Based Method (LDRBM) for prescribing highly detailed myofiber orientations and providing robust regional annotation in bi-atrial morphologies of any complexity. The robustness of our approach is verified in eight extremely detailed bi-atrial geometries, derived from a sub-millimiter Diffusion-Tensor-Magnetic-Resonance Imaging (DTMRI) human atrial fiber dataset. We validate the LDRBM by quantitatively recreating each of the DTMRI fiber architectures: a comprehensive comparison with DTMRI ground truth data is conducted, investigating differences between electrophysiology (EP) simulations provided by either LDRBM and DTMRI fibers. Finally, we demonstrate that the novel LDRBM outperforms current state-of-the-art fiber models, confirming the exceptional accuracy of our methodology and the critical importance of incorporating detailed fiber orientations in EP simulations. Ultimately, this work represents a fundamental step toward the development of physics-based digital twins of the human atria, establishing a new standard for prescribing fibers in ADT.",

    "abstract": "Turner syndrome (TS) affects approximately 1 in 2500 female live births globally, making it the most common sex chromosomal abnormality in females. It results from a partially or completely missing X chromosome, often occurring in mosaic karyotypes. TS is associated with various health issues, including short stature, delayed puberty, ovarian dysgenesis, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, infertility, congenital heart defects, endocrine disorders and autoimmune disorders. TS is less prevalent among twins. Since the first case report in 1938, the association between TS and twinning has been noted in only 30 cases worldwide. However, only six reports exist of monozygotic non-mosaic twins with TS, all 45,XO. Although TS affects individuals worldwide, the literature on TS in Asian twins is sparse, with no reported cases from Asia. This scarcity underscores the need for further research to understand this region's epidemiology and challenges. This case report highlights the importance of evaluating both twins if one is diagnosed with TS.",

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an autosomal dominant cardiac disease. The mechanisms that determine its variable expressivity are poorly understood. Epigenetics could play a crucial role in bridging the gap between genotype and phenotype by orchestrating the interplay between the environment and the genome regulation. In this study we aimed to establish a possible correlation between the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns and left ventricular hypertrophy severity in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, evaluating the potential impact of lifestyle variables and providing a biological context to the observed changes.\nMethylation data were obtained from peripheral blood samples (Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip arrays). We employed multiple pair-matched models to extract genomic positions whose methylation correlates with the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy in 3 monozygotic twin pairs carrying the same founder pathogenic variant (\nWe present a unique pair-matched model, based on 3 monozygotic twin pairs carrying the same founder pathogenic variant and different phenotypes.

    "abstract": "Noonan syndrome (NS) is a rare, genetic multisystem disorder often presenting with associated craniofacial abnormalities. The authors report an identical twin pair with classical features of NS including short stature, mild ptosis, hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, low-set angulated ears, and giant cell tumors in the craniofacial skeleton. Interestingly, these patients also presented with bilateral, symmetric, dystrophic auricular calcifications. Genome sequencing revealed identical germline son of sevenless homolog 1 mutations and inversion of chromosome 2 (p11.2q13). Awareness of the association of auricular calcifications and NS may help guide clinical management for these patients, particularly if auricular procedures are indicated.",

    "abstract": "The formation of neural tube defects, such as a meningomyelocele, is often sporadic and more common in monozygotic twin gestations but can be associated with folic acid deficiency and rarely occurs in dizygotic twins.\u00a0In this case report, we present dizygotic twins born in the United States with meningomyeloceles. In addition, their neural tube defects were complicated by hydrocephalus and decreased muscle tone and movement in the lower extremities. Repair of the meningomyeloceles occurred 48 hours after birth with neurosurgical intervention, and placement of ventriculoperitoneal shunts was performed two weeks later once the neonates were of appropriate weight.\u00a0This case report presents a rare occurrence of dizygotic twins with concurrent meningomyeloceles requiring post-natal surgical intervention to improve quality of life and decrease fatal complications of neural tube defects.",

    "abstract": "To assess the validity of the Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF) chorionicity-specific models for fetal growth in twin pregnancy.\nThis was an external validation study of the FMF models using a nationwide Danish cohort of twin pregnancies. The cohort included all dichorionic (DC) and monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies with an estimated delivery date between 2008 and 2018, which satisfied the following inclusion criteria: two live fetuses at the first-trimester ultrasound scan (11-14\u2009weeks' gestation); biometric measurements available for the calculation of estimated fetal weight (EFW) using the Hadlock-3 formula; and delivery of two liveborn infants. Validation involved assessing the distributional properties of the models and estimating the mean EFW Z-score deviations. Additionally, the models were applied to pregnancies that delivered preterm and attended non-scheduled visits (complicated pregnancies).\nOverall, 8542 DC and 1675 MCDA twin pregnancies met the inclusion criteria. In DC twins, 17\u2009084 fetuses were evaluated at a total of 95\u2009346 ultrasound scans, of which 44.5% were performed at scheduled visits in pregnancies carried to 37\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks or later. The median number of growth scans per DC twin fetus from 20\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks onwards was four. The model showed good agreement with the validation cohort for scheduled visits in DC twins delivered at 37\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks or later (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD EFW Z-score, -0.14\u2009\u00b1\u20091.05). In MCDA twins, 3350 fetuses underwent 31\u2009632 eligible ultrasound scans, of which 59.5% were performed at scheduled visits in pregnancies carried to 36\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks or later. The median number of growth scans per MCDA twin fetus from 16\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks onwards was 10. The model showed favorable agreement with the validation cohort for scheduled visits in MCDA twins delivered at 36\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks or later (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD EFW Z-score, -0.09\u2009\u00b1\u20091.01). Non-scheduled visits and preterm delivery before 37\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks for DC twins and before 36\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks for MCDA twins corresponded with smaller weight estimates, which was consistent with the study's definition of complicated pregnancy.\nThe FMF models provide a good fit for EFW measurements in our Danish national cohort of uncomplicated twin pregnancies assessed at routine scans. Therefore, the FMF models establish robust criteria for subsequent investigations and potential clinical applications. Future research should focus on exploring the consequences of clinical implementation, particularly regarding the identification of twins that are small-for-gestational age, as they are especially susceptible to adverse perinatal outcome. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).

    "results": "Overall, 8542 DC and 1675 MCDA twin pregnancies met the inclusion criteria. In DC twins, 17\u2009084 fetuses were evaluated at a total of 95\u2009346 ultrasound scans, of which 44.5% were performed at scheduled visits in pregnancies carried to 37\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks or later. The median number of growth scans per DC twin fetus from 20\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks onwards was four. The model showed good agreement with the validation cohort for scheduled visits in DC twins delivered at 37\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks or later (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD EFW Z-score, -0.14\u2009\u00b1\u20091.05). In MCDA twins, 3350 fetuses underwent 31\u2009632 eligible ultrasound scans, of which 59.5% were performed at scheduled visits in pregnancies carried to 36\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks or later. The median number of growth scans per MCDA twin fetus from 16\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks onwards was 10. The model showed favorable agreement with the validation cohort for scheduled visits in MCDA twins delivered at 36\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks or later (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD EFW Z-score, -0.09\u2009\u00b1\u20091.01). Non-scheduled visits and preterm delivery before 37\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks for DC twins and before 36\u2009+\u20090\u2009weeks for MCDA twins corresponded with smaller weight estimates, which was consistent with the study's definition of complicated pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies assessing the hypothesis that the construct of 'aberrant salience' is associated with psychosis and psychotic symptoms showed conflicting results. For this reason, the association between measures to index aberrant salience and subclinical psychotic symptoms in a general population sample was analysed. In addition, genetic vulnerability was added to the analysis as a modifier to test the hypothesis that modification by genetic vulnerability may explain variability in the results.\nThe TwinssCan project obtained data from general population twins (N\u2009=\u2009887). CAPE (Community Assessment of Psychic Experience) scores were used to index psychotic experiences. Aberrant salience was assessed with white noise task and ambiguous situations task.\nMeasures of aberrant salience were not associated with psychotic experiences, nor was there evidence for an interaction with genetic predisposition in this association (Z\u2009=\u20091.08, p\u2009=\u20090.282).\nVarious studies including the present could not replicate the association between aberrant salience and psychotic experiences in general population samples. The conflicting findings might be explained by moderation by genetic vulnerability, but results are inconsistent. If there was evidence for a main effect or interaction, this was in the positive symptom scale only. On the other hand, the association was more robust in so-called 'ultra-high risk' patients and first episode psychosis patients. Thus, this association may represent a state-dependent association, present only at the more severe end of the psychosis spectrum.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D deficiencies are very common in pregnant women, raising concerns about adverse health outcomes in children. This issue has hardly been studied in multiple pregnancies, the prevalence of which has been steadily increasing. Therefore, our study investigated the relationship between newborns' anthropometric parameters and the concentration of 25(OH)D in maternal blood of women with twin pregnancies and umbilical cord blood.\nThe study included 50 women who gave birth after the 36th week of twin gestation. The concentration of 25(OH)D was determined in maternal blood collected during the antenatal period and in the umbilical cord blood of 100 newborns. Anthropometric parameters of the newborns (birth weight, length and head and chest circumference) were obtained from hospital records. Data on nutrition and lifestyle during pregnancy were collected from the patients during an interview conducted by a dietitian.\nNo relationship between maternal and neonatal cord blood vitamin D concentrations and any of the anthropometric parameters of the newborns was found. However, only 6% of the mothers and 13% of the newborns had vitamin D deficiency (\u226420 ng/mL). The type of pregnancy and maternal height were the main factors associated with neonatal size. Newborns from dichorionic pregnancies were on average 202 g heavier (\nTherefore, in our study, the neonatal size of twins was not related to the vitamin D status but to other factors such as the type of pregnancy and maternal height.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic (MC) twins are at risk for severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) or twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS). In the case of preterm delivery, cesarean section (CS) with immediate umbilical cord clamping (ICC) of both twins is usually performed. While the recipient is at risk for polycythemia and may benefit from ICC, this procedure may result in aggravation of anemia with increased morbidity in the anemic donor. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the novel approach of selective extrauterine placental perfusion (EPP) with delayed umbilical cord clamping (DCC) in the donor infant is feasible in neonatal resuscitation of MC twins and may prevent severe anemia in donor and polycythemia in the recipient.\nPreterm MC twins with antenatal suspected severe anemia of the donor as measured by Doppler ultrasound, born with birthweights < 1500 g by CS, were transferred to the neonatal resuscitation unit with placenta and intact umbilical cords. In the donor, the umbilical cord was left intact to provide DCC with parallel respiratory support (EPP approach), while the cord of the recipient was clamped immediately after identification.\nSelective EPP was performed in three cases of MC twins with TAPS and acute peripartum TTTS. All donor twins had initial hemoglobin levels \u2265 13.0 g/dL, and none of them required red blood cell transfusion on the first day after birth.\nSelective EPP may be a feasible strategy for neonatal resuscitation of MC preterm twins with high stage TAPS and TTTS to prevent anemia-related morbidities and may improve infant outcome.",

    "abstract": "Parents of twins appear to be at increased risk of postpartum depression (PPD), yet little is known about the magnitude and timing of onset in the postpartum period compared to singleton parents.\nWe conducted a cohort study using the Danish nationwide health registers. We defined a study population of parents that is, mothers and fathers of all twin and singleton livebirths between 1997 and 2019. Postpartum depression was defined as incident depression diagnosis or a redeemed antidepressant prescription from childbirth through 365\u2009days postpartum. We performed a parametric time-to-event analysis based on Poisson regression. The time scale was time since birth, modeled using restricted cubic splines. From this we estimated the hazard ratio (HR) representing the momentary risk, and the cumulative risk ratio (RR) over the first year postpartum, in twin compared to singleton parents.\nThe study population was based on 27,095 twin and 1,350,046 singleton births. In adjusted analyses, the HR of twins compared to singletons was highest around 2\u2009months postpartum (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.10-1.49) for mothers, and around 6\u2009months (1.20, 95% CI 1.02-1.42) for fathers. The 6\u2009months adjusted cumulative RR of PPD in twins compared to singletons was 1.24 (95% CI 1.10-1.40) for mothers and 1.11 (95% CI 0.95-1.30) for fathers.\nTwin mothers had increased risk of PPD compared to singleton mothers, which was driven by an immediate increase after childbirth. The risk among twin fathers was not increased immediately after childbirth, but we found slightly elevated risk around 6\u2009months postpartum. This could suggest diverse patterns of PPD symptomatology in twin parents compared to singleton parents and between mothers and fathers. Our findings underline parents of twins as a potentially vulnerable group to PPD and emphasize the need for increased awareness of their mental health.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) are personalized virtual representations used to understand complex cardiac mechanisms. A critical component of CDT development is solving the ECG inverse problem, which enables the reconstruction of cardiac sources and the estimation of patient-specific electrophysiology (EP) parameters from surface ECG data. Despite challenges from complex cardiac anatomy, noisy ECG data, and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, recent advances in computational methods have greatly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ECG inverse inference, strengthening the fidelity of CDTs. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the methods for solving ECG inverse problems, their validation strategies, their clinical applications, and their future perspectives. For the methodologies, we broadly classify state-of-the-art approaches into two categories: deterministic and probabilistic methods, including both conventional and deep learning-based techniques. Integrating physics laws with deep learning models holds promise, but challenges such as capturing dynamic electrophysiology accurately, accessing accurate domain knowledge, and quantifying prediction uncertainty persist. Integrating models into clinical workflows while ensuring interpretability and usability for healthcare professionals is essential. Overcoming these challenges will drive further research in CDTs.",

    "abstract": "Breast asymmetry is a common disorder, which can lead to significant emotional distress. Despite this, there is currently no widely accepted approach for managing this prevalent condition. Due to the high dimorphism of the breast, despite a satisfactory result in the short-term post-op, the recurrence of asymmetry is one of the most common weak points of breast recontouring. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the long-lasting maintenance of breast symmetry in women who have undergone surgical correction of asymmetric breasts through mastopexy or reduction mammoplasty and to try to identify some specific elements to achieve more stable outcomes in the long term.\nA retrospective study was conducted on 1,984 breast surgical procedures carried out between 2002 and 2020 to evaluate patient satisfaction and the recurrence rate of asymmetry disorders. All the patients enrolled in this study were given a questionnaire to evaluate their satisfaction level. A retrospective iconographic-chart review was investigated by the same senior surgeon, who recorded the presence or the absence of recurring breast asymmetry.\nIn total, 1984 patients were enrolled who respected the minimum standard of the study; 596 showed up at post-op follow-up longer than three years. Most of the patients showed great satisfaction with the results, even if several recurrences of asymmetry were reported.\nThe recurrence of asymmetry is one of the most common weak points of breast asymmetry correction procedures due to the high dimorphism of the breasts. In order to fully assess the results of asymmetric breast correction, patients should be required to attend a post-op follow-up examination after a long time frame. Indeed, the strength of this paper lies in the focus on long-term postoperative follow-up.\nThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine whether genetic factors affect the location of dilated perivascular spaces (dPVS) by comparing healthy young twins and non-twin (NT) siblings.\nA total of 700 healthy young adult twins and NT siblings [138 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs, 79 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, and 133 NT sibling pairs] were collected from the Human Connectome Project dataset. dPVS was automatically segmented and normalized to standard space. Then, spatial similarity indices [mean squared error (MSE), structural similarity (SSIM), and dice similarity (DS)] were calculated for dPVS in the basal ganglia (BGdPVS) and white matter (WMdPVS) between paired subjects before and after propensity score matching of dPVS volumes between groups. Within-pair correlations for the regional volumes of dVPS were also assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient.\nThe spatial similarity of dPVS was significantly higher in MZ twins [higher DS (median, 0.382 and 0.310) and SSIM (0.963 and 0.887) and lower MSE (0.005 and 0.005) for BGdPVS and WMdPVS, respectively] than in DZ twins [DS (0.121 and 0.119), SSIM (0.941 and 0.868), and MSE (0.010 and 0.011)] and NT siblings [DS (0.106 and 0.097), SSIM (0.924 and 0.848), and MSE (0.016 and 0.017)]. No significant difference was found between DZ twins and NT siblings. Similar results were found even after the subjects were matched according to dPVS volume. Regional dPVS volumes were also more correlated within pairs in MZ twins than in DZ twins and NT siblings.\nOur results suggest that genetic factors affect the location of dPVS.",

As all biological processes happen in space, there is a growing interest in modeling biological entities within their native context.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Conjoined twins are a rare congenital anomaly with various types, depending on the connection site. Managing these cases requires a structured approach leading to separation surgery. This report provides a detailed description of the anesthetic strategies and challenges of pygopagous conjoined female twins who underwent 2 surgeries before separation at 17 weeks of age. CASE REPORT The female twins were conjoined at the sacral level (S4), with fused thecal sacs at L5 and cord tethering, with the conus terminating below L3 in both patients. They had separate rectal ampullae that fused into a single anal canal in the midline in a Y formation. The babies underwent 2 surgeries prior to separation: meningocele repair for twin B and anal canal dilation and sphincter mapping for both twins, followed by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion for twin B. The separation surgery included dividing the bony vertebral fusions and dural sacs, untethering the spinal cords and nerves, and correctly allocating the intrapelvic muscles, guided by sphincter muscle mapping. Anesthesia was managed by 2 distinct teams each time, with duplicated equipment and color-coded medications to prevent errors. Due to the critical condition of twin B, general anesthesia was administered to her first. The report also addresses the challenges faced during the 3 surgical procedures. CONCLUSIONS Anesthetic management for pygopagus twins presents complex challenges. Despite limited experience with similar cases, successful management was achieved through planning, effective communication, and rehearsal of unfamiliar setups. Attention to detail and involvement of highly experienced teams were crucial to the success of the procedures.",

    "abstract": "A new method was proposed to address fault diagnosis by applying the digital twin (DT) high-fidelity behavior and the deep learning (DL) data mining capabilities. Subsequently, the proposed fault distribution GAN (FDGAN) was built to map virtual and physical entities for the data from the established test platform. Finally, the MobileViG was employed to validate the model and diagnose faults. The accuracy of the proposed method with training samples of 600 and 800 were 88.4% and 99.5%, respectively. These accuracies surpass those of other methods based on CycleGAN (98.86%), CACGAN (94.92%), ACGAN (86.45%), ML1D-GAN (82.33%), and transfer learning (99.38%). Therefore, with the integration of global connectivity, an innovative network structure, and training methods, FDGAN can effectively address challenges such as network degradation, limited feature extraction in small windows, and insufficient model robustness.",

In GCK-MODY, one of the most common forms of MODY, hyperglycemia is caused by a mutation of a gene responsible for coding glucokinase. At the clinical level, this condition presents as persistent, moderate and asymptomatic elevated fasting glucose levels and has a relatively low incidence of micro and macro-vascular complications. In general, the treatment of choice is to follow and maintain a healthy lifestyle. The incidence of GCK-MODY during pregnancy is 2% on average (0-6%). In this report, we introduce a case of a woman diagnosed with GCK-MODY during the pregnancy with twins, a boy and a girl, diagnosed with GCK-MODY after birth. We discuss the course of pregnancy, the need for access to fast and uncomplicated genetic diagnostics ",

    "abstract": "The digital twin (DT), which involves creating a virtual replica of a physical asset or system, has emerged as a transformative set of tools across various industries. In the oil and gas (O&G) industry, the development of DTs represents a significant evolution in how companies manage complex operations, enhance safety, and optimize decision-making processes. Despite these significant advancements, the underlying tools, technologies, and frameworks for developing DTs in O&G applications remain non-standardized and unfamiliar to many O&G practitioners, highlighting the need for a systematic literature review (SLR) on the topic. Thus, this paper offers an SLR of the existing literature on DT development for O&G from 2018 onwards, utilizing Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection. We provide a comprehensive overview of this field, demonstrate how it is evolving, and highlight standard practices and research opportunities in the area. We perform broad classifications of the 98 studies, categorizing the DTs by their development methodologies, implementation objectives, data acquisition, asset digital development, data integration and preprocessing, data analysis and modeling, evaluation and validation, and deployment tools. We also include a bibliometric analysis of the selected papers, highlighting trends and key contributors. Given the increasing number of new DT developments in O&G and the many new technologies available, we hope to provide guidance on the topic and promote knowledge production and growth concerning the development of DTs for O&G.",

    "abstract": "We developed and validated digital twins (DTs) for contrast sensitivity function (CSF) across 12 prediction tasks using a data-driven, generative model approach based on a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM). For each prediction task, we utilized the HBM to compute the joint distribution of CSF hyperparameters and parameters at the population, subject, and test levels. This computation was based on a combination of historical data (N\u2009=\u200956), any new data from additional subjects (N\u2009=\u200956), and \"missing data\" from unmeasured conditions. The posterior distributions of the parameters in the unmeasured conditions were used as input for the CSF generative model to generate predicted CSFs. In addition to their accuracy and precision, these predictions were evaluated for their potential as informative priors that enable generation of synthetic quantitative contrast sensitivity function (qCSF) data or rescore existing qCSF data. The DTs demonstrated high accuracy in group level predictions across all tasks and maintained accuracy at the individual subject level when new data were available, with accuracy comparable to and precision lower than the observed data. DT predictions could reduce the data collection burden by more than 50% in qCSF testing when using 25 trials. Although further research is necessary, this study demonstrates the potential of DTs in vision assessment. Predictions from DTs could improve the accuracy, precision, and efficiency of vision assessment and enable personalized medicine, offering more efficient and effective patient care solutions.",

    "abstract": "This paper showcases the successful development and implementation of two Digital Twin prototypes within the Lab Digital Twins project, designed to enhance the efficiency and quality control of Aig\u00fces de Barcelona's drinking water network. The first prototype focuses on asset management, using (near) real-time data and statistical models, and achieving a 70% success rate in predicting pump station failures 137\u2009days in advance. The second prototype addresses water quality monitoring, leveraging machine learning to accurately forecast trihalomethane levels at key points in the distribution system, and enabling proactive water quality management strategies, ensuring compliance with stringent safety standards and safeguarding public health. The paper details the methodology of both prototypes, highlighting their potential to revolutionize water network management. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Digital representation of assets and processes in the drinking water treatment network Early fault detection in assets, and predictions of trihalomethane formation in the drinking water distribution network Reduction on monitoring time and incident response for target assets by means of Digital Twins Improvement in visualization, prediction, and proactive measures for asset management and water quality control Contribution to the growing knowledge on Digital Twins and their potential to revolutionize water network operations.",

    "abstract": "Aphantasia is a condition characterized by reduced voluntary mental imagery. As this lack of mental imagery disrupts visual memory, understanding the nature of this condition can provide important insight into memory, perception, and imagery. Here, we leveraged the power of case studies to better characterize this condition by running a pair of identical twins, one with aphantasia and one without, through mental imagery tasks in an fMRI scanner. We identified objective, neural measures of aphantasia, finding less visual information in their memories which may be due to lower connectivity between frontoparietal and occipitotemporal lobes of the brain. However, despite this difference, we surprisingly found more visual information in the aphantasic twin's memory than anticipated, suggesting that aphantasia is a spectrum rather than a discrete condition.",

    "abstract": "The associations between mobility limitations and device-measured physical activity are sparsely studied. In this study, these associations are studied among community-dwelling older twins.\nThis cross-sectional study utilized data gathered in 2014-2016 for the MOBILETWIN study. Participants were twins born in Finland between 1940 and 1944 (774 participants, mean age 73\u00a0years). Physical activity was measured with a hip-worn accelerometer. Mobility limitations were assessed with a questionnaire.\nIndividual-level analyses revealed that physical activity was associated with mobility limitations. Participants with severe mobility limitations took 2,637 (SD = 1,747) steps per day, those with some mobility limitations 4,437 (SD = 2,637) steps, and those without mobility limitations 7,074 (SD = 2,931) steps (p < .05). The within-twin pair analyses revealed the same pattern for the 144 dizygotic twin pairs, but no associations were seen for the 117 monozygotic twin pairs.\nAccelerometer-measured physical activity and mobility limitations were associated in community-dwelling older adults. Genetic factors may explain some of the variations in physical activity.\nA personalized exercise program to promote increased physical activity should be provided for older adults who report mobility difficulties. Future research is needed to examine causality between physical activity and mobility limitations.",

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by the impairment of \u03b1-galactosidase A. The complex intronic haplotype (CIH) variants, located in promoter and intronic regulatory lesions, has been found in patients with classical forms of Fabry disease. We present a case of Fabry disease in female monozygotic twins exhibiting the CIH mutation and classical manifestations.\nA 61-year-old woman with a history of stroke, carotid artery occlusion, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and chronic kidney disease was referred to the nephrology clinic for management of her chronic kidney disease. Her monozygotic twin sister also presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atrial flutter, carotid stenosis, and proteinuria. Clinical symptoms and a comprehensive family history strongly suggested the presence of Fabry disease. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of 5 variants within a complex intronic haplotype (CIH): c.-10\u00a0C\u2009>\u2009T, c.369\u2009+\u2009990\u00a0C\u2009>\u2009A, c.370\u2009-\u200981_370-77delCAGCC, c.640-16\u00a0A\u2009>\u2009G, and c.1000-22\u00a0C\u2009>\u2009T. We conducted a review of the patient's previous kidney biopsy findings, which demonstrated the presence of lamellated inclusion bodies in electron microscopy. Remarkably, both the monozygotic twin sister and her son exhibited the same genetic mutation. Enzyme replacement therapy was initiated for the patient. Her kidney function decreased throughout a thorough 2-year follow-up period, while there was a slight decrease in the left ventricular mass index.\nThis is the first reported case of female monozygotic twins with the CIH variants representing cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal manifestations suggestive of Fabry disease.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the relative contribution of genes to shape variation in the permanent dental arches in individuals of Western European descent.\nThe dental casts from 64 monozygotic and 38 dizygotic twins, housed in the Adelaide Dental School's twin record collection, Australia, were assessed. The subjects were of Western European descent, with a mean age of 19.4 \u00b1 5.4 years. Dental casts were scanned using a 3-dimensional scanner (3Shape E4, 3Shape, Copenhagen, Denmark), and landmarks were placed on incisal edges and cusp tips of canines, premolars, and molars. Procrustes superimposition and principal components analysis were applied to examine shape variation. Two-block partial least-squares analysis was used to assess shape covariation between arches. Structural equation modeling was utilized to decompose observed shape variation into genetic and environmental components using the normal assumptions of the twin model.\nThe first 3 principal components (PCs) of the maxillary and mandibular arch were meaningful, accounting for 53% and 50% of the variation in shape space, respectively. The PCs represented shape variability as follows: PC1 - arch depth-width ratio, PC2 - arch taper, canine position (and first premolar rotation for the mandibular arch), and PC3 - incisor displacement and rotation. Genetic modeling indicated that a model incorporating additive genetic and unique environmental factors optimally explained the observed variation for all meaningful PCs. Within shape space, most of the variation in maxillary and mandibular arches exhibited moderate to high heritability (h\nIn this cohort, dental arch shape variation was predominantly influenced by genetic factors. High covariation and heritability were observed between the maxillary and mandibular dental arches. This information may help inform decisions around orthodontic intervention.",

    "results": "The first 3 principal components (PCs) of the maxillary and mandibular arch were meaningful, accounting for 53% and 50% of the variation in shape space, respectively. The PCs represented shape variability as follows: PC1 - arch depth-width ratio, PC2 - arch taper, canine position (and first premolar rotation for the mandibular arch), and PC3 - incisor displacement and rotation. Genetic modeling indicated that a model incorporating additive genetic and unique environmental factors optimally explained the observed variation for all meaningful PCs. Within shape space, most of the variation in maxillary and mandibular arches exhibited moderate to high heritability (h",

    "abstract": "Voice production can be influenced by interindividual variations related to genetic, physiological, behavioral, and several environmental factors. Here we examined the effect of zygosity on speaking fundamental frequency (F0) statistical descriptors. Our aims were: (1) to determine whether the genetic similarity between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins affects F0 characteristics, and (2) to quantify the contribution of genetic factors to these characteristics. The study involved 79 same-sex twin pairs of Brazilian Portuguese speakers, comprising 65 MZ and 14 DZ twins, aged 18 to 66 years (31.7 \u00b1 11.6 years), with 21 male and 58 female pairs. Participants were recorded while uttering a greeting phrase and the Brazilian Portuguese version of the 'Happy Birthday to You' song. Speech segments were analyzed using Praat free software, and F0 measures were automatically extracted in both Hertz and semitone scales. Statistical descriptors, including centrality, dispersion, and extreme values of F0 were examined, and the ACE model (i.e., total genetic effects, A; shared environmental influences, C; and nonshared environmental influences, E) was employed to estimate the additive effect;ts of monozygosity. As anticipated, we observed a zygosity effect on several F0 parameters, with more similarity between MZ twins compared to DZ twins. We discuss the genetic influences on F0 parameters and the absence of a monozygosity effect in two of them. Additionally, we briefly address potential biases associated with the selected measurement scale for statistical modeling. Finally, we explore the influence of genetic factors on F0 patterns, as well as environmental, life history and linguistic factors, particularly concerning F0 variation in speech.",

    "abstract": "Bridges are vital construction infrastructures that almost every nation needs in order to function. Climate change is a significant issue, that especially affects the construction industry. It is very important that bridges are able to withstand the impacts of climate change and adaptation measures will be required to achieve this.\nThe digital twin will be developed using BIM to manage the climate change adaptation measures for the bridges. A 6D BIM model will be created that includes the 3D Revit model of a bridge featuring climate change measures, the climate change adaptation measures timeline schedule, climate change adaptation cost estimation, and carbon emission estimation, which will be produced using Revit software, Navisworks, and Granta EduPack. The results will show how 6D BIM can be used to support the adaptation of bridges to the effects of climate change.\nThe findings underscore the efficacy of 6D BIM in enhancing bridge resilience against climate change impacts. The 3D model demonstrates integration of adaptation measures without compromising bridge functionality. Moreover, the 4D model's timeline scheduling facilitates hazard anticipation, project planning, communication enhancement, collaborative efforts, and project visualization. Cost estimations from the 5D model reveal varying costs among adaptation measures, while the 6D model highlights differences in carbon footprints. These BIM dimensions enable stakeholders to analyse effects on project costs and energy consumption, aiding sustainability and cost-efficiency considerations.\nThe study exhibits the literature review analysis, the risk assessment, research on climate change adaptation strategies, and implementation using Revit 2022, Navisworks 2022, and Granta EduPack software. By contributing to the adaptation of bridges to climate change effects, the research has provided valuable insights and practical implications for enhancing bridge resilience globally.\nBridges are vital construction infrastructures that almost every nation needs in order to function.

All participants were aged between 10 and 30 years and were instructed on the methods and techniques involved in the study.\nThe lip prints of participants were recorded using dark-colored lipstick, bond paper, cellophane tape, and a brush, and were examined for lip thickness measurement (in mm), classification of lip commissures, and assessment of groove patterns. The findings were then analyzed to determine the pattern of lip prints among twins and non-twin siblings.\nCheiloscopy, the forensic investigation technique based on lip trace identification, could benefit from this study's findings as it explores the existence of heredity in lip prints of Indian twins and non-twin siblings.",

One severely deficient twin (the parasite) relies on the other twin's heart (the autosite) to survive. The circumstance only arises when parts of the body of the developed and delivered twin are joined to the undeveloped or underdeveloped twin. Very few case reports of this uncommon congenital defect have been published in the literature. Here, we describe a case of this atypical entity in a neonate in which the rudimentary pelvis and thigh of the parasite were attached to the autosite of the twin.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and sedentarism are associated with increased liver and pancreatic fat content (LFC and PFC, respectively) as well as impaired organ metabolism. Exercise training is known to decrease organ ectopic fat but its effects on organ metabolism are unclear. Genetic background affects susceptibility to obesity and the response to training. We studied the effects of regular exercise training on LFC, PFC, and metabolism in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for BMI. We recruited 12 BMI-discordant monozygotic twin pairs (age 40.4, SD 4.5 years; BMI 32.9, SD 7.6, 8 female pairs). Ten pairs completed six months of training intervention. We measured hepatic insulin-stimulated glucose uptake using [",

    "abstract": "Mutations in ABCA3 can result in surfactant deficiency, leading to respiratory distress syndrome in term neonates, and interstitial lung disease (ILD) in children. Here, we report an extremely rare case of ILD in an identical twin with novel ABCA3 germline mutations. Interestingly, they showed mostly similar, but slightly different, clinical features. Our cases suggest that, in addition to genetic factors, non-genetic factors are involved in the severity of the disease and its clinical course. Studies of gene-environment interactions, especially with twins, are needed, as they may contribute to the understanding of the clinical heterogeneity of ILD and its\u00a0 association with various underlying conditions as well as rare variant mutations.",

    "abstract": "Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). It is characterized by severe and progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness with death in the first 2\u00a0years of life if left untreated. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase-alfa is lifesaving, but its effectiveness is influenced by the patient's cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status, dose of ERT, and the development of high antibody titers, which can reduce the therapy's efficacy. The inability of CRIM-negative IOPD patients to produce native GAA exposes them to a high risk of development of anti-rhGAA IgG antibody titers, leading to treatment failure. We present the case of CRIM-negative dizygotic twins treated with high-dose alglucosidase-alfa (40\u00a0mg/kg/week), initiated at 28\u00a0days (Twin A) and 44\u00a0days (Twin B). Both twins received immune tolerance induction (ITI) with rituximab, methotrexate, and IVIG to mitigate antibody response.

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins originate from a single fertilized egg, making them genetically identical at the time of conception. However, postzygotic somatic mutations (PZMs) can introduce genetic differences after separation. Although whole-genome sequencing (WGS) sheds light on somatic mutations in cancer genomics, its application in genomic studies of MZ twins remains limited. In this study, we investigate PZMs in 30 healthy MZ twin pairs from the Osaka University Center for Twin Research using WGS (average depth\u2005=\u200523.8) and a robust germline-calling algorithm. We find high genotype concordance rates (exceeding 99%) in MZ twins. We observe an enrichment of PZMs with variant allele frequency around 0.5 in twins with highly concordant genotypes. These PZMs accumulate more frequently in non-coding regions compared with protein-coding regions, which could potentially influence gene expression. No significant association is observed between the number of PZMs and age or sex. Direct sequencing confirms a missense mutation in the ANKRD35 gene among the PZMs. By applying a genome-wide mutational signature pattern technique, we detect an age-related clock-like signature in these early postzygotic somatic mutations in MZ twins. Our study provides insights that contribute to a deeper understanding of genetic variation in MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "Although age is an important risk factor for both cancer and frailty, it is unclear whether cancer itself increases the risk of frailty. We aimed to assess the association between cancer and frailty in a longitudinal cohort of older Danish twins, taking familial effect into account.\nUsing the Danish Cancer Registry, cancer cases were identified among participants aged 70 and over in the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins (LSADT). Frailty was evaluated over 10 years of follow-up using the frailty index (FI) and defined as FI\u2005>\u20050.21. Stratified Cox regressions were performed on discordant twin pairs (pairs where one twin had incident cancer and the other was cancer-free) and on all LSADT individual twins (twin pairs and singletons) with no history of cancer.\nAmong the 72 discordant pairs (n\u2005=\u2005144, median age at inclusion\u2005=\u200575) included in the study, the median FI at inclusion was 0.08 for both cancer twins and cancer-free co-twins. From the stratified Cox regression, twins with cancer had an increased hazard of developing frailty (hazard ratio [HR]\u2005=\u20053.67, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2005=\u20051.02-13.14) compared with their cancer-free co-twins. The analyses on individual twins (n\u2005=\u20054\u2005027) provided similar results, showing an increased hazard of frailty in individuals with cancer (HR\u2005=\u20052.57, 95% CI\u2005=\u20051.77-3.74) compared with those without cancer.\nWe showed a higher risk of becoming frail following a cancer diagnosis in both discordant twin pairs and individual twins. These findings support the importance of monitoring frailty in older adults with cancer through geriatric assessments and the implementation of frailty interventions.",

    "abstract": "Dyslipidemia is one of the cardiometabolic risk factors that influences mortality globally. Unraveling the causality between blood lipids and metabolites and the complex networks connecting lipids, metabolites, and other cardiometabolic traits can help to more accurately reflect the body's metabolic disorders and even cardiometabolic diseases. We conducted targeted metabolomics of 248 metabolites in 437 twins from the Chinese National Twin Registry. Inference about Causation through Examination of FAmiliaL CONfounding (ICE FALCON) analysis was used for causal inference between metabolites and lipid parameters. Bidirectional mediation analysis was performed to explore the linkages between blood lipids, metabolites, and other seven cardiometabolic traits. We identified 44, 1, and 31 metabolites associated with triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), most of which were gut microbiota-derived metabolites. There were 9, 1, and 14 metabolites that showed novel associations with TG, TC, and HDL-C, respectively. ICE FALCON analysis found that TG and HDL-C may have a predicted causal effect on 23 and six metabolites, respectively, and one metabolite may have a predicted causal effect on TG. Mediation analysis discovered 14 linkages connecting blood lipids, metabolites, and other cardiometabolic traits. Our study highlights the significance of gut microbiota-derived metabolites in lipid metabolism. Most of the identified cross-sectional associations may be due to the lipids having a predicted causal effect on metabolites, but not vice versa, nor are they due to family confounding. These findings shed new light on lipid metabolism and personalized management of cardiometabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "The network theory posits that depression emerges as the result of individual symptoms triggering each other. Risk factors for depression can impact these between-symptoms interactions through extended networks. The study aimed to model the extended network of depressive symptoms and known depression risk factors - objective cognitive function, intellectual, physical, and social daily activities, and then, compare the observed networks between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) co-twins.\nTwin pairs, 722 MZ and 2200 DZ, aged 40-79, were selected from the Dansh Twin Registry for having complete measures of depressive symptoms (e.g., sadness), cognitive functions (e.g., verbal memory), physical (e.g., brisk walk), intellectual (e.g., reading newspapers) and social activities (e.g., phone calls). Gaussian graphical models were used to estimate and compare the networks first between co-twins and then, between MZ to DZ twin pairs separately.\nSpecific intellectual, physical and social activities were central in the extended networks of depressive symptoms and, with the exception of processing speed, more central than cognition. The extended networks' structure was more homogeneous between MZ co-twins relative to DZ co-twins. Cognitive nodes were more central in MZ than DZ co-twins.\nCross-sectional design, participants were middle-aged or older, mostly affective (non-somatic) depressive symptoms.\nIn depression networks, core connecting elements were intellectual, physical and social activities. The interaction between cognition and daily activities seems critical for triggering depressive symptoms. Thus, clinical interventions aimed at preventing depression and associated cognitive deficits should focus on maintenance and/or engagement in stimulating daily activities.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the application and effectiveness of prenatal ultrasound in diagnosing and managing conjoined twins.\nA retrospective analysis was conducted on 20 cases of conjoined twins diagnosed at our hospital between January 2016 and December 2022. The types of conjoined twins, ultrasonographic characteristics, and associated anomalies were assessed.\nThe gestational age at diagnosis ranged from 10 to 35\u2009weeks, with an average of 14.21\u2009\u00b1\u20095.69\u2009weeks. Thirteen cases were detected in the first trimester, five in the early second trimester, one at 23\u2009+\u20092\u2009weeks, and one at 35\u2009weeks. Thoracopagus was the most common type (11 cases, 55%), followed by omphalopagus (4 cases, 20%), cephalopagus (4 cases, 20%), and parapagus dicephalus (1 case, 5%). In the first trimester, the most common abnormalities observed included increased nuchal translucency (NT), cystic hygroma, hydrops fetalis, and generalized edema. Major birth defects identified in conjoined twins were omphalocele (3 cases), congenital heart malformations (3 cases), neural tube defects (2 cases), urachal cyst (1 case), and umbilical cyst (1 case). Pregnancy was terminated in 18 cases, one case resulted in spontaneous abortion during the second trimester, and one case was delivered by cesarean section at 37\u2009weeks, with successful separation and recovery.\nPrenatal ultrasound is the primary diagnostic tool for conjoined twins. It effectively assesses the extent of twin fusion, provides critical information for clinical decision-making, and aids in the management of obstetric care.",

    "abstract": "This article aims to identify epigenetic markers and detect early development of hematopoietic malignancies through an epigenome wide association study of DNA methylation data.\nThis register-based study includes 1,085 Danish twins with 31 hematopoietic malignancies and methylation levels from 450,154 5'-C-phospate-G-3' (CpG) sites. Associations between methylation levels and incidence of hematopoietic malignancy is studied through time-to-event regression. The matched case-cotwin design, where one twin has a malignancy and the cotwin does not, is applied to enhance control for unmeasured shared confounding and false discoveries. Predictive performance is validated in the independent Older Finnish Twin Cohort.\nWe identified 67 epigenetic markers for hematopoietic malignancies of which 12 are linked to genes associated with hematologic malignancies. For some markers, we discovered a 2-3-fold relative risk difference for high versus low methylation. The identification of these 67 sites enabled the formation of a predictor demonstrating a cross-validated time-varying area under the curve (AUC) of 92% 3 years after individual blood sampling and persistent performance above 70% up to 6 years after blood sampling. This predictive performance was to a large extent recovered in the validation sample showing an overall Harrell's C of 73%. In conclusion, from a large population representative twin study on hematopoietic cancers, novel epigenetic markers were identified that may prove useful for early diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Data sharing promotes the scientific progress. However, not all data can be shared freely due to privacy issues. This work is intended to foster FAIR sharing of sensitive data exemplary in the biomedical domain, via an integrated computational approach for utilizing and enriching individual datasets by scientists without coding experience.\nWe present an in silico pipeline for openly sharing controlled materials by generating synthetic data. Additionally, it addresses the issue of inexperience to computational methods in a non-IT-affine domain by making use of a cyberinfrastructure that runs and enables sharing of computational notebooks without the need of local software installation. The use of a digital twin based on cancer datasets serves as exemplary use case for making biomedical data openly available.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the effect of elective fetal reduction on maternal-fetal outcomes in uncomplicated twin pregnancies compared with ongoing twin pregnancies.\nThe data sources included PubMed, Scopus (until December 2023), and references of retrieved articles.\nWe included clinical studies examining the association between selective fetal reduction of uncomplicated dichorionic twins on pregnancy outcomes.\nQuality assessment of observational studies was conducted using the ROBINS-I tool. The overall quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. A quantitative analysis was performed for electively reduced dichorionic twins. The primary outcome was preterm birth. The secondary outcomes were gestational age at delivery, stillbirth, neonatal intensive care unit admission, gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, and pregnancy loss at <24 weeks of gestation. Summary odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and random-effects models were used for data synthesis.\nThe initial electronic search yielded 745 studies; 175 studies were further identified from reference citations. Five articles included appropriate data and were finally included in the meta-analysis. All studies were evaluated as having \"moderate risk of bias.\" These 5 studies reported on dichorionic twins. Elective reduction in dichorionic twins reduces the risk for preterm birth at <37 weeks (4 studies; n=1577; odds ratio, 0.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.22; moderate-quality evidence), <34 weeks (3 studies; n=1335; odds ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.69; low-quality evidence), and <32 weeks (3 studies; n=1335; odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.88; low-quality evidence), gestational diabetes (3 studies; n=1410; odds ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.97; low-quality evidence), pregnancy-associated hypertensive disorders (2 studies; n=581; odds ratio, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.83; low-quality evidence), and birthweight <10th centile (2 studies; n=1163; odds ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.43; moderate-quality evidence) and <5th centile (2 studies; n=1163; odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.50; low-quality evidence), and increases gestational age at delivery (4 studies; n=1362; mean difference, 2.93 weeks; 95% confidence interval, 2.08-3.77; moderate-quality evidence). The risks for stillbirth (2 studies; n=1311; odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-6.21; very low-quality evidence) and pregnancy loss at <24 weeks (3 studies; n=1436; odds ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.55-2.58; very low-quality evidence) were not statistically significantly different.\nCompared with ongoing dichorionic twin pregnancies, dichorionic pregnancies that undergo elective selective fetal reduction are associated with lower incidences of preterm birth at <37, <34, and <32 weeks, birthweight <10th and <5th centile, gestational diabetes, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and later gestational age at delivery by almost 3 weeks. These associations were often based on very low-quality evidence. Thus, these results should be interpreted with caution, and further studies should be conducted.

    "abstract": "Conventional patient monitoring methods require skin-to-skin contact, continuous observation, and long working shifts, causing physical and mental stress for medical professionals. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) assists healthcare workers in monitoring patients distantly using various wearable sensors, reducing stress and infection risk. RPM can be enabled by using the Digital Twins (DTs)-based Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) that merges robotics with the Internet of Things (IoT) and creates a virtual twin (VT) that acquires sensor data from the physical twin (PT) during operation to reflect its behavior. However, manual navigation of PT causes cognitive fatigue for the operator, affecting trust dynamics, satisfaction, and task performance. Also, operating manual systems requires proper training and long-term experience. This research implements autonomous control in the DTs-based IoRT to remotely monitor patients with chronic or contagious diseases. This work extends our previous paper that required the user to manually operate the PT using its VT to collect patient data for medical inspection. The proposed decision-making algorithm enables the PT to autonomously navigate towards the patient's room, collect and transmit health data, and return to the base station while avoiding various obstacles. Rather than manually navigating, the medical personnel direct the PT to a specific target position using the Menu buttons. The medical staff can monitor the PT and the received sensor information in the pre-built virtual environment (VE). Based on the operator's preference, manual control of the PT is also achievable. The experimental outcomes and comparative analysis verify the efficiency of the proposed system.",

    "abstract": "The scientific field of precision agriculture employs increasingly innovative techniques to optimize inputs, maximize profitability, and reduce environmental impact. However, obtaining a high number of soil samples is challenging in order to make precision agriculture viable. There is a trade-off between the amount of data needed and the time and resources spent to obtain these data compared to the accuracy of the maps produced with more or fewer points. In the present study, the research was based on an exhaustive dataset of apparent electrical conductivity (aEC) containing 3906 points distributed along 26 transects with spacing between each of up to 40 m, measured by the proximal soil sensor EM38-MK2, for a grain-producing area of 72 ha in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. A second sparse dataset was simulated, showing only four transects with a 400 m distance and, in the end, only 162 aEC points. The aEC map via ordinary kriging (OK) from the grid with 26 transects was considered the reference, and two other mapping approaches were used to map aEC via sparse grid: kriging with external drift (KED) and geographically weighted regression (GWR). These last two methods allow the increment of auxiliary variables, such as those obtained by remote sensors that present spatial resolution compatible with the pivot scale, such as data from the Landsat-8, Aster, and Sentinel-2 satellites, as well as ten terrain covariates derived from the Alos Palsar digital elevation model. The KED method, when used with the sparse dataset, showed a relatively good fit to the aEC data (R",

    "abstract": "Authoritarianism and populism are used regularly to describe the individuals responsible for anti-democratic action. These two constructs share some similarities with regard to how they hinder democracy and at times have been used interchangeably to describe such issues. However, authoritarians and populists may differ with regard to their political identification, as well as how they view the government and the existing establishment.\nWith a US college sample, this study's goal was to examine how authoritarianism and populist attitudes influence views on pluralism, elitism, trust in government, identity fusion, and political identification (identification with American political parties).\nThe findings indicated that right-wing authoritarians trusted the government, endorsed elitist attitudes, but were low on pluralism; this pattern was the opposite for those high on populist attitudes. Left-wing authoritarianism was related only to low pluralism. Moreover, low trust in the government partially mediated the link between populist attitudes and pluralism. Results also indicated that right-wing and left-wing authoritarians identified with the Republican and Democratic parties, respectively, whereas political identification was unrelated to populist attitudes. Furthermore, identity fusion partially mediated the link between right-wing authoritarianism and identification with the Republican Party.\nAuthoritarianism and populist attitudes may explain different motivations for anti-democratic thought and behaviors. This study contributes to ongoing debates found in contemporary populism and authoritarianism research as well as different solutions to addressing their rise in mainstream politics.",

    "abstract": "Whether differences in lifestyle between co-twins are reflected in differences in their internal or external exposome profiles remains largely underexplored. We therefore investigated whether within-pair differences in lifestyle were associated with within-pair differences in exposome profiles across four domains: the external exposome, proteome, metabolome and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA). For each domain, we assessed the similarity of co-twin profiles using Gaussian similarities in up to 257 young adult same-sex twin pairs (54% monozygotic). We additionally tested whether similarity in one domain translated into greater similarity in another. Results suggest that a lower degree of similarity in co-twins' exposome profiles was associated with greater differences in their behavior and substance use. The strongest association was identified between excessive drinking behavior and the external exposome. Overall, our study demonstrates how social behavior and especially substance use are connected to the internal and external exposomes, while controlling for familial confounders.",

    "abstract": "Twin bonds, likely the most enduring of human relationships, provide both solace and rivalry for twins. Using an evolutionary psychology perspective, this chapter scrutinizes twins' bonds from prenatal stages to childhood to better understand their unique relationships. Twins' interactions, which begin in the womb, establish patterns of cooperation and competition. The initial years pose parenting challenges that shape the twins' experiences of dependency and rivalry. As twins grow, five dimensions-closeness, dependence, conflict, rivalry, and dominance-emerge, evolving distinctly between monozygotic twins (MZ: sharing close to 100% of their genes) and dizygotic twins (DZ: sharing on average 50% of their genetic variance). The chapter notes the closer relationship MZ twins share compared to DZ twins. While the closeness and dependence among DZ twins decline throughout childhood, these elements remain stable in MZ twins. The effect of zygosity on conflict and rivalry is less clear. For both MZ and DZ twins, conflict stays steady, while rivalry intensifies with school entry, probably driven by external comparisons, but lessens as twins develop into late childhood. Unlike singletons, where birth order dictates dominance dynamics, in twins, this dynamic is more variable and becomes more defined by around 6.5 years of age. Several factors are presented as impacting the nature of the twins' relationships: the evolvement of 'twin language', the parenting style and the differential parenting they receive. This exploration into the development of twins' relationships underlines the importance of tailored caregiving and invites further research into the genetic and environmental factors that shape close bonds.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies, in the background of lack of twin registry in India, are a challenge. We report the response rates in tracing a hospital birth register-based cohort of twins using mail and door to door survey, ocular parameters influencing refractive errors, and their heritability.\nTwins born from 1991 to 1995 in a tertiary hospital in the Vellore District of South India from a database were traced by mail and home survey from March 2011 to September 2013. Consenting live twin pairs who presented to the eye department were examined, including best corrected visual acuity, cycloplegic refraction, slit lamp examination, measurements of intraocular pressure (IOP) by Goldmann Applanation tonometry, axial length (AL) and anterior chamber depth (ACD), central corneal thickness (CCT), specular microscopy for endothelial count (EC), and a dilated fundus examination. Zygosity was determined by a validated zygosity questionnaire. Heritability was determined using the Falconers formula.\nPostal contact was made in 14%, and a home visit was successful in another 23% of the cohort. Of those presenting for examination, 51.3% were found to be monozygous. Heritability (h 2 ) of IOP was 0.34, that of ACD was 0.88, that of AL was 0.92, that of CCT was 0.96, and that of EC was 0.58.\nTracing of twins using postal and home visits is challenging. Heritability for AL and CCT was found to be high, similar to that reported in other studies. This implies that a large proportion of variation found in AL and CCT is due to genetic causes as seen in twins from South India.",

    "abstract": "Diprosopus is one of the rarest types of conjoined twins, caused by incomplete zygote separation in early pregnancy. It defines a condition with duplication of facial structures, monocephalic and 1 trunk. Early detection is difficult, but fetal MRI plays an important role in strengthening antenatal diagnosis of conjoined twin pregnancies and other major congenital abnormalities, complementing antenatal ultrasonography. A 28-year-old patient (G2P1A0) was referred from the regional general hospital for suspected malformations, including Dandy-Walker syndrome and a small mandible Antenatal 3-D ultrasound at 35 weeks revealed a single baby with macrosomia, hypoplasia of the vermis, and cleft lip with malformation of facial structures. A 3 Tesla MRI (Signa, GE Healthcare) revealed various developmental brain anomalies, including duplication of the frontotemporal lobes, corpus callosum agenesis, and small posterior fossa. The identification of 4 orbital structures raised suspicions of face duplication. This patient underwent a caesarean section and delivered a diprosopus twin baby. MRI emerged as an indispensable adjunct, complementing ultrasound in detecting congenital malformations. The success of this approach emphasizes collaborative efforts between clinicians and radiologists for accurate identification and management of complex fetal anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the evolving nature of coronary hemodynamics is crucial for early disease detection and monitoring progression. We require digital twins that mimic a patient's circulatory system by integrating continuous physiological data and computing hemodynamic patterns over months. Current models match clinical flow measurements but are limited to single heartbeats. To this end, we introduced the longitudinal hemodynamic mapping framework (LHMF), designed to tackle critical challenges: (1) computational intractability of explicit methods; (2) boundary conditions reflecting varying activity states; and (3) accessible computing resources for clinical translation. We show negligible error (0.0002-0.004%) between LHMF and explicit data of 750 heartbeats. We deployed LHMF across traditional and cloud-based platforms, demonstrating high-throughput simulations on heterogeneous systems. Additionally, we established LHMF",

    "abstract": "Pregnancies ending before 26 weeks contribute 1% of births but 40% of infant deaths in the United States. The rate of these \"periviable\" births to non-Hispanic (NH) Black women exceeds four times that for NH whites. Small male periviable infants remain most likely to die. NH white periviable males weigh more than their NH Black counterparts. We argue that male infants born from twin gestations, in which one fetus died in utero (i.e., the vanishing twin syndrome), contribute to the disparity. We cannot directly test our argument because \"vanishing\" typically occurs before clinical recognition of pregnancy. We, however, describe and find associations that would emerge in vital statistics were our argument correct. Among male periviable singleton births from 288 monthly conception cohorts (January 1995 through December 2018), we found an average NH white advantage of 30 grams (759 grams versus 729 grams). Consistent with our argument, however, cohorts signaling relatively few survivors of the vanishing twin syndrome showed no disparity.",

    "abstract": "The digital twin (DT) is a concept widely used in industry to create digital replicas of physical objects or systems. The dynamic, bi-directional link between the physical entity and its digital counterpart enables a real-time update of the digital entity. It can predict perturbations related to the physical object's function. The obvious applications of DTs in healthcare and medicine are extremely attractive prospects that have the potential to revolutionize patient diagnosis and treatment. However, challenges including technical obstacles, biological heterogeneity, and ethical considerations make it difficult to achieve the desired goal. Advances in multi-modal deep learning methods, embodied AI agents, and the metaverse may mitigate some difficulties. Here, we discuss the basic concepts underlying DTs, the requirements for implementing DTs in medicine, and their current and potential healthcare uses. We also provide our perspective on five hallmarks for a healthcare DT system to advance research in this field.",

    "abstract": "Meta-analyses are commonly performed based on random-effects models, while in certain cases one might also argue in favor of a common-effect model. One such case may be given by the example of two \"study twins\" that are performed according to a common (or at least very similar) protocol. Here we investigate the particular case of meta-analysis of a pair of studies, for example, summarizing the results of two confirmatory clinical trials in phase\u00a0III of a clinical development program. Thereby, we focus on the question of to what extent homogeneity or heterogeneity may be discernible and include an empirical investigation of published (\"twin\") pairs of studies. A pair of estimates from two studies only provide very little evidence of homogeneity or heterogeneity of effects, and ad hoc decision criteria may often be\u00a0misleading.",

    "abstract": "We present a case study highlighting prenatal ultrasound findings in monozygotic twins with chromosome 17q12 deletion syndrome. Fetus A exhibited bilateral fetal pyelectasis and talipes equinovarus, while fetus B showed hyperechogenic kidneys. Despite sharing the same de novo variant, the twins displayed distinct clinical phenotypes, suggesting the presence of non-genetic factors influencing the phenotypic variability of this syndrome. This case represents the first documented instance of prenatally identified identical twins affected by 17q12 deletion syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins (CT) is a rare congenital disorder characterised by the presence of malformations associated with secondary abnormal conjoined organ changes and abnormal hemodynamic superimposed effects about 1 in every 200 identical twin pregnancies, between 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 live births. The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics of conjoined twins.\nThis was a retrospective descriptive study. All medical records of conjoined twins who were admitted to Hasan Sadikin Bandung General Hospital from January 1st, 2015, to June 30th, 2023, were reviewed for gender, conjoined type, birth order, risk factor and treatment.\nOf the 28 conjoined twins, 21 were girls (75%), and 7 were boys (25%); 19 (67,85%) were of the thoracoomphalopagus type; 11 (39,28%) were born as first children; 18 (64,28%) were born at 37 weeks of gestational age; and 22 twins' (78,57%) parents were aged between 21 and 35 years. None of the mothers had used medication, 13 (46,42%) took folic acid on occasion, five (17,85%) used traditional herbs, nine (32,14%) smoked and none drank alcohol. Parents who live in industrial areas were 18 (64.28%). There was no history of conjoined twins in previous pregnancies or deliveries or in the parent's family. Liver separation had been done in four (14.28%). Emergency separation in one twin. Nine (21.42%) patients died before surgery due to a worsening condition.\nThe conjoined twins were more common in girls, predominantly of the thoracoomphalopagus type. Risk factors that were commonly found were the first child, a gestational age of less than 37 weeks, and living in an industrial area.",

    "abstract": "Identical twins are also called monozygotic twins which originate from the same zygote that possesses the same genetic make-up. To discriminate between identical monozygotic twins, short tandem repeats has not been found effective, therefore, various techniques, including next-generation sequencing (NGS), are applied. Monozygotic twins can be identified through germ line genomes, through speech using deep learning networks, and through epigenetic analysis. Fingerprint analysis has also been used to distinguish between identical twins, as human beings have unique fingerprints. Two distinct levels of fingerprint are used to distinguish between monozygotic twins based upon the differences in the minutiae points. Examination of the methylation pattern of the genome has an enormous potential to differentiate between identical twins, as the methylation of DNA occurs uniquely to each individual. This article offers an insight into the latest methods and techniques used for the differentiation between the identical twins.",

    "abstract": "Optimal seatbelt practices for pregnant women with twins at different gestational ages remain uncertain. To offer recommendations for a comfortable seatbelt system, this cross-sectional observational study explored seatbelt usage and driving habits among women with twins across various pregnancy stages through an online survey that explored driving conditions and comfortable seatbelts at different stages of pregnancy. Women who drove daily before their pregnancy with twins decreased their driving frequency as the pregnancy progressed. Correct seatbelt usage was lower and no seatbelt usage was higher among pregnant women with twins than those with singleton pregnancies. They adapted their seatbelt-wearing techniques to minimise pressure on the chest in the first and third trimesters and the abdomen from the second trimester onwards. The comfortable seatbelts were those that could alleviate belt pressure, featuring waist belts to reduce pressure, wider belts to avoid localised pressure, and shoulder belts resembling a backpack type. When wearing a seatbelt, avoiding pressure on the thorax and abdomen is key for pregnant women with twins. This study suggests that the suitability of driving for pregnant women with twins in their last trimester and the reliability of seatbelts designed for such women should be further examined and validated.",

This multi-system disorder offers a unique window to explore genotype-phenotype relationships in a disease model. However, genetic prognosticators of RTT have limited clinical value due to the disorder's heterogeneity on multiple levels. This case report used a precision medicine approach to better understand the clinical phenotype of RTT twins with an identical pathogenic ",

    "abstract": "Digital twins of patients are virtual models that can create a digital patient replica to test clinical interventions \nThis article presents a scalable full-stack architecture for a patient simulation application driven by graph-based models. This patient simulation application enables medical practitioners and trainees to simulate the trajectory of critically ill patients with sepsis. Directed acyclic graphs are utilized to model the complex underlying causal pathways that focus on the physiological interactions and medication effects relevant to the first 6 h of critical illness. To realize the sepsis patient simulation at scale, we propose an application architecture with three core components, a cross-platform frontend application that clinicians and trainees use to run the simulation, a simulation engine hosted in the cloud on a serverless function that performs all of the computations, and a graph database that hosts the graph model utilized by the simulation engine to determine the progression of each simulation.\nA short case study is presented to demonstrate the viability of the proposed simulation architecture.\nThe proposed patient simulation application could help train future generations of healthcare professionals and could be used to facilitate clinicians' bedside decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide; yet the understanding of their molecular basis is incomplete. Multi-omics studies have significant potential to uncover these mechanisms, but such studies are challenged by genetic and environmental confounding-a problem that can be effectively reduced by investigating intrapair differences in twins. Here, we linked data on all diagnoses of the circulatory system from the nationwide Danish Patient Registry (spanning 1977-2022) to a study population of 835 twins holding genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression data. CVD diagnoses were divided into prevalent or incident cases (i.e., occurring before or after blood sample collection (2007-2011)). The diagnoses were classified into four groups: cerebrovascular diseases, coronary artery disease (CAD), arterial and other cardiovascular diseases (AOCDs), and diseases of the veins and lymphatic system. Statistical analyses were performed by linear (prevalent cases) or cox (incident cases) regression analyses at both the individual-level and twin pair-level. Significant genes (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in both types of biological data and at both levels were inspected by bioinformatic analyses, including gene set enrichment analysis and interaction network analysis.\nIn general, more genes were found for prevalent than for incident cases, and bioinformatic analyses primarily found pathways of the immune system, signal transduction and diseases for prevalent cases, and pathways of cell-cell communication, metabolisms of proteins and RNA, gene expression, and chromatin organization groups for incident cases. This potentially reflects biology related to response to CVD (prevalent cases) and mechanisms related to regulation and development of disease (incident cases). Of specific genes, Myosin 1E was found to be central for CAD, and DEAD-Box Helicase 5 for AOCD. These genes were observed in both the prevalent and the incident analyses, potentially reflecting that their DNA methylation and gene transcription levels change both because of disease (prevalent cases) and prior disease (incident cases).\nWe present novel biomarkers for CVD by performing multi-omics analysis in twins, hereby lowering the confounding due to shared genetics and early life environment-a study design that is surprisingly rare in the field of CVD, and where additional studies are highly needed.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins, innovative virtual models synthesizing real-time biological, environmental, and lifestyle data, herald a new era in personalized medicine, particularly dermatology. These models, integrating medical-purpose Internet of Things (IoT) devices, deep and digital phenotyping, and advanced artificial intelligence (AI), offer unprecedented precision in simulating real-world physical conditions and health outcomes. Originating in aerospace and manufacturing for system behavior prediction, their application in healthcare signifies a paradigm shift towards patient-specific care pathways. In dermatology, digital twins promise enhanced diagnostic accuracy, optimized treatment plans, and improved patient monitoring by accommodating the unique complexities of skin conditions. However, a comprehensive review across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus until February 5th, 2024, underscores a significant research gap; no direct studies on digital twins' application in dermatology is identified. This gap signals challenges, including the intricate nature of skin diseases, ethical and privacy concerns, and the necessity for specialized algorithms. Overcoming these barriers through interdisciplinary efforts and focused research is essential for realizing digital twins' potential in dermatology. This study advocates for a proactive exploration of digital twins, emphasizing the need for a tailored approach to dermatological care that is as personalized as the patients themselves.",

    "abstract": "The place of digital twin technology in any healthcare system is a truly disruptive innovation that has profound consequences all across medical research and practice. Digital twins represent the virtual replicas that correspond to some physical entity by pulling real-time data streams from different sources to model biological systems for health monitoring and personalization of treatment strategies. This paper presents a detailed review of the current research landscape into digital twins for healthcare. Through bibliometric analysis, we obtained 1,663 publications from 2012 to 2024, basically sourced from the Scopus database, establishing a portion of the trends, productive authors, influential sources, and collaboration networks in this fast-evolving field. Descriptively, our results indicate that although research into this area started way back, the bulk of research began to be realized from 2018 onwards, with appreciable contributions coming in from interdisciplinary fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics. Even with challenges to data interoperability and other privacy concerns, this change brought on by digital twin technology is undoubtedly a considerable promise for chronic disease management, predictive analytics, drug discovery, and surgical planning. This work brings immense insight into this new domain of digital twins in health, which shall set up a strong foundation for future research and innovation in this area.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of twin pregnancies is on the rise worldwide due to assisted reproductive technologies. Cervical dilatation is a frequent complication and can be considered a cause of premature births in twin pregnancies. In vitro fertilization (IVF) twins are more prone to preterm delivery. Routine cervical cerclage with normal cervical length is not recommended in twins, but studies were not done on IVF twins. So, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of routine transvaginal cerclage in twin IVF pregnancies with normal cervical length on maternofetal outcome.\nA retrospective case-control study was conducted at a maternity hospital in eastern India\u00a0from January 2016 to December 2019 with over 21800 deliveries. Two groups were taken, cases were those IVF twins with normal cervical length in whom cervical cerclage was done as they have referred to our hospital from the IVF centers for cerclage and in control no-cervical cerclage as they are referred from other IVF centers where cerclage was not a routine protocol. We have excluded cerclage done for history, ultrasound indicated, uterine anomalies, and monochorionic twins. Fifteen participants were recruited in both cases and controls.\nIn our study 2 (6.66%), 4 (13%), and 26 (86%) were IVF twins delivered at a gestational age of <28 weeks, 28-32 weeks, and 32-37 weeks, respectively. The mean age of participants, mean gestation age at delivery, and birth weight in cases and control were 35.27 \u00b1 5.98 years (min: 23; max: 45), 32.40 \u00b1 5.54 years (min: 25; max: 44); 34 weeks 2 days \u00b1 3.28 (min: 31; max: 37), 33 weeks 5\u00a0days \u00b1 1.66 (min: 25; max: 37); 1961.33 \u00b1 340 gram, 1899.33 \u00b1 437.48 gram, respectively with no statistical significant difference (p = 0.186, p = 1, p = 0.668, respectively) Conclusion: Routine transvaginal cerclage is not effective in twin IVF pregnancies with normal cervical length for preventing preterm births. IVF twin women usually present at a late age and their birth weight are also low.",

    "abstract": "Scientific advancement is universally based on the dynamic interplay between theoretical insights, modeling, and experimental discoveries. However, this feedback loop is often slow, including delayed community interactions and the gradual integration of experimental data into theoretical frameworks. This challenge is particularly exacerbated in domains dealing with high-dimensional object spaces, such as molecules and complex microstructures. Hence, the integration of theory within automated and autonomous experimental setups, or theory in the loop-automated experiment, is emerging as a crucial objective for accelerating scientific research. The critical aspect is to use not only theory but also on-the-fly theory updates during the experiment. Here, we introduce a method for integrating theory into the loop through Bayesian conavigation of theoretical model space and experimentation. Our approach leverages the concurrent development of surrogate models for both simulation and experimental domains at the rates determined by latencies and costs of experiments and computation, alongside the adjustment of control parameters within theoretical models to minimize epistemic uncertainty over the experimental object spaces. This methodology facilitates the creation of digital twins of material structures, encompassing both the surrogate model of behavior that includes the correlative part and the theoretical model itself. While being demonstrated here within the context of functional responses in ferroelectric materials, our approach holds promise for broader applications, such as the exploration of optical properties in nanoclusters, microstructure-dependent properties in complex materials, and properties of molecular systems.",

    "abstract": "and purpose: Little is known about the training and experience of osteopaths who treat paediatric patients, and graduates report feeling unprepared for this aspect of practice. The purpose of this study was to investigate the lived experience of Australian osteopaths who regularly treat these patients, in order to better understand their individual educational pathways and their management of this population.\nOsteopaths who reported regularly treating paediatric patients were recruited through the Osteopathy Research and Innovation Network (ORION) national practice-based network. Semi-structured interviews were completed, transcribed and thematically analysed using the principles of Descriptive Phenomenology to compile qualitative data.\nTen osteopaths were interviewed, whose age ranged from 33 to 71 years and with 15-46 years of clinical experience. Proportion of paediatric patients ranged from 20 to 90\u00a0% of participants' caseload according to self-report. Seven themes were identified that reflected the lived experience of treating paediatric patients: 1) Variable pathways to practice, 2) Challenges and rewards, 3) Scope of practice, 4) Team-based care, 5) Importance of entry-level skills, 6) Family-centred care, and 7) Success.\nThe study found a diversity of educational pathways, that paediatric practice was highly rewarding, the scope of practice was based on diagnostic skills and experience, the practitioners had extensive team-based professional networks, practice reflected a family-centred care model, and personal measures of success were multifactorial. These results give insight into this area of practice to guide further research.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common heart rhythm disorder, may cause stroke and heart failure. For patients with persistent AF with fibrosis proliferation, the standard AF treatment-pulmonary vein isolation-has poor outcomes, necessitating redo procedures, owing to insufficient understanding of what constitutes good targets in fibrotic substrates. Here we present a prospective clinical and personalized digital twin study that characterizes the arrhythmogenic properties of persistent AF substrates and uncovers locations possessing rotor-attracting capabilities. Among these, a portion needs to be ablated to render the substrate not inducible for rotors, but the rest (37%) lose rotor-attracting capabilities when another location is ablated. Leveraging digital twin mechanistic insights, we suggest ablation targets that eliminate arrhythmia propensity with minimum lesions while also minimizing the risk of iatrogenic tachycardia and AF recurrence. Our findings provide further evidence regarding the appropriate substrate ablation targets in persistent AF, opening the door for effective strategies to mitigate patients' AF burden.",

    "abstract": "Separating with close siblings and leaving the parental home at an early age represents a major life event for an adolescent (reflected by age at separation in a twin pair) and may predispose them to poor mental health. This study aims to examine the association of age at separation and residential mobility on depressive symptoms in late adolescence and young adulthood and to explore possible underlying genetic effects.\nResidential mobility consisted of the number and total distance of moves before age 17. Based on 3071 twins from the FinnTwin12 cohort, we used linear regression to assess the association of age at separation and residential mobility with General Behavior Inventory (GBI) scores at age 17 and in young adulthood. A higher GBI score indicated more depressive symptoms occurred. Then, the mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) was used to visualize the scores' trajectory and test the associations, controlling for \"baseline\" state. Twin analyses with a bivariate cross-lagged path model were performed between the difference in GBI scores, between cotwins, and separation status for the potential genetic influence.\nCompared to twins separated before age 17, twins who separated later had significantly lower GBI scores at age 17 and in young adulthood. In MMRM, separation at a later age and a higher number of moves were associated with a higher GBI score in young adulthood. A small genetic effect was detected wherein GBI within-pair differences at age 17 were associated with separation status before age 22 (coefficient: 0.01).\nThe study provides valid evidence about the influence of siblings and family on depressive symptoms in later adolescence and young adulthood while finding some evidence for a reverse direction effect. This suggests more caution in the interpretation of results. A strong association between residential mobility and depressive symptoms was affirmed, although further detailed research is needed.",

    "abstract": "An increasing amount of research is incorporating the concept of Digital twin (DT) in biomedical and health care applications. This scoping review aims to summarize existing research and identify gaps in the development and use of DTs in the health care domain. The focus of this study lies on summarizing: the different types of DTs, the techniques employed in DT development, the DT applications in health care, and the data resources used for creating DTs. We identified fifty studies, which mainly focused on creating organ- (n=15) and patient-specific twins (n=30). The research predominantly centers on cardiology, endocrinology, orthopedics, and infectious diseases. Only a few studies used real-world datasets for developing their DTs. However, there remain unresolved questions and promising directions that require further exploration. This review provides valuable reference material and insights for researchers on DTs in health care and highlights gaps and unmet needs in this field.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the different pathways between predictor factors such as zygosity, atypical swallowing, mouth breathing, breastfeeding and bottle feeding related to anterior open bite (AOB) in twins.\nThe study was conducted in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin children aged 3-15 years. AOB, atypical swallowing, mouth breathing, feeding type, duration of bottle use, and mouth opening status during sleep were recorded during oral examination. Partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) and sobel tests were performed to assess the total and indirect effects among the variables on AOB.\nA total of 404 children (29.2% MZ;70.8% DZ) participated in this study. The effect of zygosity on mouth breathing in the PLS-SEM model was statistically significant. Conversely, it was determined that mouth breathing effected that atypical swallowing (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Atypical swallowing triggered AOB (p\u2009=\u20090.001). The atypical swallowing has a mediation effect between AOB and mouth breathing (p\u2009=\u20090.020). Mouth breathing causes atypical swallowing and therefore indirectly increases the likelihood of AOB.\u00a0While breastfeeding decreases AOB incidence (p\u2009=\u20090.023),\u00a0bottle feeding increases AOB incidence (p\u2009=\u20090.046).\u00a0The sobel tests show that the fully mediator variable feature of mouth breathing is statistically significant in the negative relation between zygosity and atypical swallowing.\nThe PLS-SEM model showed that mouth breathing triggers atypical swallowing and atypical swallowing triggers AOB. As a result of this chain of relationships, an indirect effect of zygosity on AOB was observed. According to sobel tests, zygosity has an indirect effect on atypical swallowing through mouth breathing, while mouth breathing has a positive indirect effect on AOB through atypical swallowing.\nThis study identified the relationships between different factors and the presence of AOB. The findings of this study demonstrate in detail the relationships between AOB and zygosity, atypical swallowing, mouth breathing, breastfeeding and bottle feeding. Brestfeeding has a reducing effect on the frequency of AOB. Among the nutritional forms, breastfeeding ensures the proper development of the stomatognathic system by working the oro-facial muscles.",

    "abstract": "To clarify the mechanistic basis for the success or failure of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF).\nWe created digital twins based on mechanistic computational models of individual patients with AHRF.\nInterdisciplinary Collaboration in Systems Medicine Research Network.\nWe used individual patient data from 30 moderate-to-severe AHRF patients who had failed high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy and subsequently underwent a trial of NIV.\nUsing the digital twins, we evaluated lung mechanics, quantified the separate contributions of external support and patient respiratory effort to lung injury indices, and investigated their relative impact on NIV success or failure.\nIn digital twins of patients who successfully completed/failed NIV, after 2 hours of the trial the mean (sd) of the change in total lung stress was -10.9 (6.2)/-0.35 (3.38) cm H2O, mechanical power -13.4 (12.2)/-1.0 (5.4) J/min, and total lung strain 0.02 (0.24)/0.16 (0.30). In the digital twins, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) produced by HFNC was similar to that set during NIV. In digital twins of patients who failed NIV vs. those who succeeded, intrinsic PEEP was 3.5 (0.6) vs. 2.3 (0.8) cm H2O, inspiratory pressure support was 8.3 (5.9) vs. 22.3 (7.2) cm H2O, and tidal volume was 10.9 (1.2) vs. 9.4 (1.8) mL/kg. In digital twins, successful NIV increased respiratory system compliance +25.0 (16.4) mL/cm H2O, lowered inspiratory muscle pressure -9.7 (9.6) cm H2O, and reduced the contribution of patient spontaneous breathing to total driving pressure by 57.0%.\nIn digital twins of AHRF patients, successful NIV improved lung mechanics, lowering respiratory effort and indices associated with lung injury. NIV failed in patients for whom only low levels of positive inspiratory pressure support could be applied without risking patient self-inflicted lung injury due to excessive tidal volumes.",

    "abstract": "Whole-skin DNA methylation variation has been implicated in several diseases, including melanoma, but its genetic basis has not yet been fully characterized. Using bulk skin tissue samples from 414 healthy female UK twins, we performed twin-based heritability and methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) analyses for >400,000 DNA methylation sites. We find that the human skin DNA methylome is on average less heritable than previously estimated in blood and other tissues (mean heritability: 10.02%). meQTL analysis identified local genetic effects influencing DNA methylation at 18.8% (76,442) of tested CpG sites, as well as 1,775 CpG sites associated with at least one distal genetic variant. As a functional follow-up, we performed skin expression QTL (eQTL) analyses in a partially overlapping sample of 604 female twins. Colocalization analysis identified over 3,500 shared genetic effects affecting thousands of CpG sites (10,067) and genes (4,475). Mediation analysis of putative colocalized gene-CpG pairs identified 114 genes with evidence for eQTL effects being mediated by DNA methylation in skin, including in genes implicating skin disease such as ALOX12 and CSPG4. We further explored the relevance of skin meQTLs to skin disease and found that skin meQTLs and CpGs under genetic influence were enriched for multiple skin-related genome-wide and epigenome-wide association signals, including for melanoma and psoriasis. Our findings give insights into the regulatory landscape of epigenomic variation in skin.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring a deep geological repository for radioactive waste during the operational phases relies on a combination of fit-for-purpose numerical simulations and online sensor measurements, both producing complementary massive data, which can then be compared to predict reliable and integrated information (e.g., in a digital twin) reflecting the actual physical evolution of the installation over the long term (i.e., a century), the ultimate objective being to assess that the repository components/processes are effectively following the expected trajectory towards the closure phase. Data prediction involves using historical data and statistical methods to forecast future outcomes, but it faces challenges such as data quality issues, the complexity of real-world data, and the difficulty in balancing model complexity. Feature selection, overfitting, and the interpretability of complex models further contribute to the complexity. Data reconciliation involves aligning model with in situ data, but a major challenge is to create models capturing all the complexity of the real world, encompassing dynamic variables, as well as the residual and complex near-field effects on measurements (e.g., sensors coupling). This difficulty can result in residual discrepancies between simulated and real data, highlighting the challenge of accurately estimating real-world intricacies within predictive models during the reconciliation process. The paper delves into these challenges for complex and instrumented systems (multi-scale, multi-physics, and multi-media), discussing practical applications of machine and deep learning methods in the case study of thermal loading monitoring of a high-level waste (HLW) cell demonstrator (called ALC1605) implemented at Andra's underground research laboratory.",

    "abstract": "Unvaccinated identical twins developed bilateral anterior uveitis soon after the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms. During follow-up, both patients developed choroiditis, and one twine developed posterior scleritis and serous retinal detachment. Prompt treatment with oral prednisone ameliorated the lesions, and no recurrence was observed at the 18-month follow-up. Choroiditis may rarely be associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and it responds well to corticosteroid therapy. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, we hypothesize that the virus may act as an immunological trigger for choroiditis.",

    "abstract": "In the context of climate change mitigation, calls for methods that can facilitate co-creative practices and processes between different stakeholders in the development of sustainable and climate-neutral urban districts have been increasingly expressed in recent years. This has included calls for collaborative, accessible, transparent and open tools that can facilitate urban development processes and engage different stakeholders in the different phases and stages of an urban district development process towards shared targets on sustainability and emission reduction. In this paper, we present and examine two practical tools, 1) a co-creation model for developing positive energy district (PED) solutions, and 2) a digital twin tool for shared data sharing and collaboration, which were developed and utilized recently in two development projects focusing on Kera district, Espoo, Finland. The Kera district is a current brownfield area, which, since the early 2020s, has been undergoing a transformation from a former industrial and mass logistics area into a future mixed-use urban district with significant emphasis on sustainability and circular economy targets. We utilize actor-network theory (ANT) to explore the human and the non-human actors and their interrelations related to the district's development. Additionally, we seek to understand the networks that emerge within both the co-creation process and the virtual urban digital twin environment and the role these tools have in supporting the formation and facilitation of multi-stakeholder co-creation networks. Finally, we aim to examine the advantages and disadvantages of integrating a regional urban digital twin and the urban co-creation process to enhance sustainability in urban development projects.",

    "abstract": "Meeting food safety requirements without jeopardizing quality attributes or sustainability involves adopting a holistic perspective of food products, their manufacturing processes and their storage and distribution practices. The virtualization of the food supply chain offers opportunities to evaluate, simulate, and predict challenges and mishaps potentially contributing to present and future food safety risks. Food systems virtualization poses several requirements: (1) a comprehensive framework composed of instrumental, digital, and computational methods to evaluate internal and external factors that impact food safety; (2) nondestructive and real-time sensing methods, such as spectroscopic-based techniques, to facilitate mapping and tracking food safety and quality indicators; (3) a dynamic platform supported by the Internet of Things (IoT) interconnectivity to integrate information, perform online data analysis and exchange information on product history, outbreaks, exposure to risky situations, etc.; and (4) comprehensive and complementary mathematical modeling techniques (including but not limited to chemical reactions and microbial inactivation and growth kinetics) based on extensive data sets to make realistic simulations and predictions possible. Despite current limitations in data integration and technical skills for virtualization to reach its full potential, its increasing adoption as an interactive and dynamic tool for food systems evaluation can improve resource utilization and rational design of products, processes and logistics for enhanced food safety. Virtualization offers affordable and reliable options to assist stakeholders in decision-making and personnel training. This chapter focuses on definitions and requirements for developing and applying virtual food systems, including digital twins, and their role and future trends in enhancing food safety.",

    "abstract": "Imperforate hymen is an uncommon obstructive anomaly of the developing female reproductive tract. There are occasional case reports of imperforate hymen occurring in family clusters, suggesting a plausible familial mode of inheritance. We describe a set of monozygotic premature twins with imperforate hymen noted at birth, whose mother was diagnosed with the same condition as a teenager. We also elucidate the likely underlying mode of inheritance of imperforate hymen.\nWe utilized the CARE (Case Report) guideline in reporting the cases.\nThese are monozygotic twins born prematurely at 30 weeks of gestation, noted at birth to have bulging cyst-like structures protruding from their vaginas. The twins were not dysmorphic and did not have any other congenital malformations. Over the next few weeks, these cyst-like structures (mucoceles) became less prominent. The genital anomaly was diagnosed as imperforate hymen. Their mother was also diagnosed with an imperforate hymen when she was 12 years old and was treated with hymenectomy.\nThis unique occurrence of imperforate hymen in a set of premature monozygotic twins and their mother suggests a plausible autosomal or X-linked dominant mode of inheritance. Given the role of genetic inheritance in imperforate hymen development, it is important to screen female relatives of an index case for this genital anomaly.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether it is the magnitude of early postnatal catch-up growth (CUG) in response to fetal growth restriction (FGR) or the FGR itself that negatively impacts cognitive outcome in a model of monochorionic twins discordant for fetal growth.\nThis analysis is part of the LEMON study, a cohort study including all monochorionic twins with selective FGR aged 3 through 17\u00a0years. Growth measurements as documented by our primary care system were collected retrospectively. An age-appropriate neurodevelopmental test was performed generating a full-scale IQ (FSIQ). CUG at 2\u00a0years was calculated as (weight [kg] at 2\u00a0years-birth weight [kg]). We used a multivariable regression model investigating the association between FSIQ (outcome) and birth weight zscore, gestational age at birth and CUG at 2\u00a0years (predictors). Generalized estimating equations accounted for the fact that observations between cotwins are not independent.\nMedian age at follow-up of the 46 included twin pairs was 11 (IQR 8-13) years. Birth weight z score and gestational age at birth were significantly associated with FSIQ, with \u03b2-coefficients of 5.897 (95% CI 3.382-8.411), and 2.589 (95% CI 1.227-3.951), respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Adjusted for birth weight z score and gestational age, CUG in the first 2\u00a0years after birth was not significantly associated with FSIQ (\u03b2-coefficient 0.108 [95% CI -1.373 to 1.590], P\u00a0=\u00a0.886).\nOur results, combining detailed growth measurements and neurodevelopmental follow-up in a discordant identical twin model, demonstrate that FGR itself rather than early postnatal CUG has negative consequences for cognitive development.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins share the same genotype; however, they can be phenotypically discordant on various traits. Studying discordant monozygotic twins allows the investigation of differences in associations between symptoms and psychopathological risk factors, controlled for shared genetic liability. The network approach to psychopathology suggests that depressive symptoms, along with risk and protective factors (e.g., cognition, daily activities), form a complex system of mutually interacting components. We compared monozygotic twins discordant for lifetime depression on their respective extended networks of depressive symptoms, cognitive functions and daily activities (intellectual, physical, social), and evaluated if these networks differ in their associations between variables and in the role of each variable within the network. Regularized partial correlations investigated the networks' composition in 147 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for depression from the Danish Twin Registry. Affected twins had stronger overall associations within their network of depressive symptoms, cognitive functions and daily activities than their unaffected co-twins, while the importance of the network components' associations did not differ between the co-twins. In affected twins, decreased frequency in experiencing happiness had the strongest association with remaining variables (i.e., the most influence in activating other network elements). Also, variables from different groups were significantly associated (e.g., loneliness with delayed memory, pessimism with low social activities, verbal learning with intellectual activities). In unaffected twins, both mood symptoms and cognitive functions were important, but between-groups associations were quasi-absent. These results suggest that external events affecting the ability to feel happiness likely trigger the psychopathological process (depression network activation), independently from the genetic predisposition to depression.",

Genetically informative twin modeling tested the direction of causation between A\u03b2s and t-Tau.\nNo clear evidence that A\u03b240 or A\u03b242 directly causes changes in t-Tau was observed; the alternative causal hypotheses also fit the data well. In contrast, exploratory analyses suggested a causal impact of the A\u03b2 biomarkers on NFL. Separately, reciprocal causation was observed between t-Tau and NFL.\nPlasma A\u03b240 or A\u03b242 do not appear to have a direct causal impact on t-Tau.

    "abstract": "The past several decades have seen rapid advances in diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and stroke, enabled by technological breakthroughs in imaging, genomics, and physiological monitoring, coupled with therapeutic interventions. We now face the challenge of how to (1) rapidly process large, complex multimodal and multiscale medical measurements; (2) map all available data streams to the trajectories of disease states over the patient's lifetime; and (3) apply this information for optimal clinical interventions and outcomes. Here we review new advances that may address these challenges using digital twin technology to fulfill the promise of personalized cardiovascular medical practice. Rooted in engineering mechanics and manufacturing, the digital twin is a virtual representation engineered to model and simulate its physical counterpart. Recent breakthroughs in scientific computation, artificial intelligence, and sensor technology have enabled rapid bidirectional interactions between the virtual-physical counterparts with measurements of the physical twin that inform and improve its virtual twin, which in turn provide updated virtual projections of disease trajectories and anticipated clinical outcomes. Verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification builds confidence and trust by clinicians and patients in the digital twin and establishes boundaries for the use of simulations in cardiovascular medicine. Mechanistic physiological models form the fundamental building blocks of the personalized digital twin that continuously forecast optimal management of cardiovascular health using individualized data streams. We present exemplars from the existing body of literature pertaining to mechanistic model development for cardiovascular dynamics and summarize existing technical challenges and opportunities pertaining to the foundation of a digital twin.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins are often thought to have identical genomes, but recent work has shown that early post-zygotic events can result in a spectrum of DNA variants that are different between MZ twins. Such variants may explain phenotypic discordance and contribute to disease etiology. Here we performed whole genome sequencing in 17 pairs of MZ twins discordant for a psychotic disorder (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder). We examined various classes of rare variants that are discordant within a twin pair. We identified four genes harboring rare, predicted deleterious missense variants that were private to an affected individual in the cohort. Variants in FOXN1 and FLOT2 would have been categorized as damaging from recent schizophrenia and bipolar exome sequencing studies. Additionally, we identified four rare genic copy number variants (CNVs) private to an affected sample, two of which overlapped genes that have shown evidence for association with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. One such CNV was a 3q29 duplication previously implicated in autism and developmental delay. We have performed the largest MZ twin study for discordant psychotic phenotypes to date. These findings warrant further investigation using other analytical approaches.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion neuroimaging has emerged as an essential non-invasive technique to explore in vivo microstructural characteristics of white matter (WM), whose integrity allows complex behaviors and cognitive abilities. Studying the factors contributing to inter-individual variability in WM microstructure can provide valuable insight into structural and functional differences of brain among individuals. Genetic influence on this variation has been largely investigated in twin studies employing different measures derived from diffusion neuroimaging. In this context, we performed a comprehensive literature search across PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science of original twin studies focused on the heritability of WM. Overall, our results highlighted a consistent heritability of diffusion indices (i.e., fractional anisotropy, mean, axial and radial diffusivity), and network topology among twins. The genetic influence resulted prominent in frontal and occipital regions, in the limbic system, and in commissural fibers. To enhance the understanding of genetic influence on WM microstructure further studies in less heterogeneous experimental settings, encompassing all diffusion indices, are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins have become a popular and widely used tool for assessing risk and resilience, particularly as they have increased in the fidelity and accuracy of their representation of real-world systems. Although digital twins provide the ability to experiment on and assess risks to and from a system without damaging the real-world system, they pose potentially significant security risks. For example, if a digital twin of a power system has sufficient accuracy to allow loss of electrical power service due to a natural hazard to be estimated at the address level with a high degree of accuracy, what prevents someone wishing to lead to disruption at this same building from using the model to solve the inverse problem to determine which parts of the power system should be attacked to maximize the likelihood of loss of service to the target facility? This perspective article discusses the benefits and risks of digital twins and argues that more attention needs to be paid to the risks posed by digital twins.",

    "abstract": "Disease-discordant twins are excellent subjects for matched case-control studies as they allow for the control of confounding factors such as age, gender, genetic background, and intrauterine and early environment factors. \nPast medical history documentation and physical examination were conducted for all participants. Fasting venous blood samples were taken to measure fasting blood glucose (FBG) and lipid levels. The ACE model, a structural equation model, was used to assess heritability.\nThis study included 710 twin pairs (210 monozygotic and 500 dizygotic) ranging in age from 2 to 52 years (mean age: 11.67\u00b110.71 years). The study was conducted using participants from the Isfahan Twin Registry (ITR) in 2017. Results showed that in early childhood (2-6 years), height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were influenced by shared environmental factors (76%, 75%, and 73%, respectively). In late childhood (7-12 years), hip circumference, waist circumference (WC), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were found to be highly heritable (90%, 76%, and 64%, respectively). In adolescents, height (94%), neck circumference (85%), LDL-cholesterol (81%), WC (70%), triglycerides (69%), weight (68%), and BMI (65%) were all found to be highly or moderately heritable. In adult twins, arm circumference (97%), weight (86%), BMI (82%), and neck circumference (81%) were highly heritable.\nThis study demonstrates that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in influencing individuals at different stages of their lives. Notably, while certain traits such as obesity have a high heritability during childhood, their heritability tends to decrease as individuals transition into adulthood.",

    "abstract": "This case report presents a comprehensive assessment of four maltreated adolescents, two half-siblings, and two non-identical twins to investigate the effects of complex childhood trauma on brain functioning. The study aimed to identify shared psychophysiological features in the electroencephalographic (EEG) data of these adolescents compared to database norms. Quantitative EEG, event-related potentials (ERPs), and their independent components were analyzed to examine alterations in patterns of electrical activity associated with psychopathology. In the half-sibling pair, enhanced P1 and N1 amplitudes were observed during the cued Go/NoGo task, while reduced N2 amplitude was present in the fraternal twins. The type of trauma also seems to affect EEG spectral distribution and higher-order cognitive processes, such as attention allocation and response inhibition (N2 wave). Specifically, physically abused and bullied adolescents showed reduced N2 amplitudes and lower alpha power in the posterior region. No significant differences were noted in the ERP-independent components for maltreated adolescents compared to norms. The analysis of these cases aimed to provide insights into the neurobiological substrates underlying the overlapping symptoms and syndromes of child maltreatment, which may aid in differential diagnosis and the development of targeted interventions for trauma-related psychopathology in adolescents.",

    "abstract": "Geroscience focuses on interventions to mitigate molecular changes associated with aging. Lifestyle modifications, medications, and social factors influence the aging process, yet the complex molecular mechanisms require an in-depth exploration of the epigenetic landscape. The specific epigenetic clock and predictor effects of a vegan diet, compared to an omnivorous diet, remain underexplored despite potential impacts on aging-related outcomes.\nThis study examined the impact of an entirely plant-based or healthy omnivorous diet over 8 weeks on blood DNA methylation in paired twins. Various measures of epigenetic age acceleration (PC GrimAge, PC PhenoAge, DunedinPACE) were assessed, along with system-specific effects (Inflammation, Heart, Hormone, Liver, and Metabolic). Methylation surrogates of clinical, metabolite, and protein markers were analyzed to observe diet-specific shifts.\nDistinct responses were observed, with the vegan cohort exhibiting significant decreases in overall epigenetic age acceleration, aligning with anti-aging effects of plant-based diets. Diet-specific shifts were noted in the analysis of methylation surrogates, demonstrating the influence of diet on complex trait prediction through DNA methylation markers. An epigenome-wide analysis revealed differentially methylated loci specific to each diet, providing insights into the affected pathways.\nThis study suggests that a short-term vegan diet is associated with epigenetic age benefits and reduced calorie intake. The use of epigenetic biomarker proxies (EBPs) highlights their potential for assessing dietary impacts and facilitating personalized nutrition strategies for healthy aging. Future research should explore the long-term effects of vegan diets on epigenetic health and overall well-being, considering the importance of proper nutrient supplementation.\nClinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT05297825.",

    "abstract": "Do the mothers of twins and singletons differ regarding post-partum and old-age mortality?\nTwin deliveries were associated with higher post-partum maternal mortality than singleton deliveries, but the lifetime post-partum mortality risk was similar for mothers of twins and singletons; survival of twinners was higher than survival of the mothers of singletons after the 67th lifespan percentile.\nTwinning is typically associated with higher post-partum maternal mortality. The evidence about whether twinning incurs long-term survival costs of reproduction or is a trait pertinent to long-lived women is scarce and contradictory.\nThe study is based on the data of the Estonian Family Register (operating from 1926 to 1943) and involves 5565 mothers of twins and 119\u00a0613 mothers of singletons born between 1850 and 1899. The subset for comparing maternal lifespans included 1703-1884 mothers of twins and 19\u00a0747-36\u00a0690 mothers of singletons.\nPost-partum maternal mortality was analyzed in the whole sample (including mothers of a single child) by logistic regression. Most of the analyses were performed in samples where each mother of twins was matched against mothers of singletons based on parity (or number of deliveries), urban versus rural and inland versus coastal origin, whether their lifespan was known, date of birth and age at first birth. Lifespans were compared in linear mixed models. Quantile regression was used to analyze age-dependent variations in maternal mortality rates. All models were adjusted for relevant biodemographic covariates.\nThe twinning rate in the whole sample was 4.4%. During the year after giving birth, maternal mortality for twin deliveries was 0.75% (17/2273) and 0.37% (449/122\u00a0750) for singleton deliveries (OR\u2009=\u20092.05, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.21-3.23). However, the lifetime post-partum mortality risk for mothers of twins (0.51%; 28/5557) and singletons (0.37%; 438/119\u00a0466) did not differ significantly (OR\u2009=\u20091.38, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.91-1.98). The life spans of the mothers of twins and singletons did not differ in matched samples. Past the 67th lifespan percentile, the odds of survival were significantly higher for mothers of twins than mothers of singletons, as indicated by non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals.\nRelatively low number of individuals (22\u00a0802-28\u00a0335) with known age at death in matched datasets due to discontinuation of the register after 1943.\nThe finding that mothers of twins had higher odds of old-age survival than mothers of singletons is consistent with the contention that twinners represent a non-random subset of women whose robust phenotypic quality allows them to outlive the mothers of singletons in old age.\nThe study was funded by the Estonian Research Council grants PRG1137, PRG2248, and PSG669.

    "abstract": "Rotational spectroscopy is the most accurate method for determining structures of molecules in the gas phase. It is often assumed that a rotational spectrum is a unique \"fingerprint\" of a molecule. The availability of large molecular databases and the development of artificial intelligence methods for spectroscopy make the testing of this assumption timely. In this paper, we pose the determination of molecular structures from rotational spectra as an inverse problem. Within this framework, we adopt a funnel-based approach to search for molecular twins, which are two or more molecules, which have similar rotational spectra but distinctly different molecular structures. We demonstrate that there are twins within standard levels of computational accuracy by generating rotational constants for many molecules from several large molecular databases, indicating that the inverse problem is ill-posed. However, some twins can be distinguished by increasing the accuracy of the theoretical methods or by performing additional experiments.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between cognitive functioning and 59 modifiable and intrinsic factors at the cusp of midlife.\nWe analyzed data from 1221 participants in the Colorado Adoption/Twin Study of Lifespan behavioral development and cognitive aging (CATSLife; M\nEight robust factors were identified, including education attainment, cognitive complexity, purpose-in-life, and smoking status. Twins reporting higher levels of cognitive complexity and purpose-in-life showed better cognitive performance than their cotwin, while smoking was negatively associated. Using meta-analytically derived effect size threshold, we additionally identified that twins experiencing more financial difficulty tend to perform less well compared with their cotwin.\nThe findings highlight the early midlife link between cognitive functioning and lifestyle/psychological factors, beyond prior cognitive performance, brain status, genetic and familial confounders. Our results further highlight the potential of established adulthood as a crucial window for dementia prevention interventions targeting lifestyle and psychosocial factors.\nCog complexity(+), purpose-in-life(+) were associated with cognition in early midlife.Smoking(-) was also associated with cognition in early midlife.Results were consistent controlling for genetic and environmental confounds.Association between EA and cognition might be mostly genetic and familial confounded.",

    "abstract": "Today's approach to medicine requires extensive trial and error to determine the proper treatment path for each patient. While many fields have benefited from technological breakthroughs in computer science, such as artificial intelligence (AI), the task of developing effective treatments is actually getting slower and more costly. With the increased availability of rich historical datasets from previous clinical trials and real-world data sources, one can leverage AI models to create holistic forecasts of future health outcomes for an individual patient in the form of an AI-generated digital twin. This could support the rapid evaluation of intervention strategies in silico and could eventually be implemented in clinical practice to make personalized medicine a reality. In this work, we focus on uses for AI-generated digital twins of clinical trial participants and contend that the regulatory outlook for this technology within drug development makes it an ideal setting for the safe application of AI-generated digital twins in healthcare. With continued research and growing regulatory acceptance, this path will serve to increase trust in this technology and provide momentum for the widespread adoption of AI-generated digital twins in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a childhood-onset complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by problems with communication and social interaction and restricted, repetitive, stereotyped behavior. The prevalence of ASD is one in 36 children. The genetic architecture of ASD is complex in spite of its high heritability. To identify the potential candidate genes of ASD, we carried out a comprehensive genetic study of monozygotic (MZ) twins concordant or discordant for ASD.\nFive MZ twins and their parents were recruited for the study. Four of the twins were concordant, whereas one was discordant for ASD. Whole exome sequencing was conducted for the twins and their parents. The exome DNA was enriched using Twist Human Customized Core Exome Kit, and paired-end sequencing was performed on HiSeq system.\nWe identified several rare and pathogenic variants (homozygous recessive, compound heterozygous, de novo) in ASD-affected individuals.\nWe report novel variants in individuals diagnosed with ASD. Several of these genes are involved in brain-related functions and not previously reported in ASD. Intriguingly, some of the variants were observed in the genes involved in sensory perception (auditory [MYO15A, PLEC, CDH23, UBR3, GPSM2], olfactory [OR9K2], gustatory [TAS2R31], and visual [CDH23, UBR3]). This is the first comprehensive genetic study of MZ twins in an Indian population. Further validation is required to determine whether these variants are associated with ASD.",

Intriguingly, some of the variants were observed in the genes involved in sensory perception (auditory [MYO15A, PLEC, CDH23, UBR3, GPSM2], olfactory [OR9K2], gustatory [TAS2R31], and visual [CDH23, UBR3]). This is the first comprehensive genetic study of MZ twins in an Indian population. Further validation is required to determine whether these variants are associated with ASD.",

    "abstract": "This perspective article explores the use of digital twins (DTs) in medicine, highlighting its capacity to simulate risks and personalize treatments while examining the emerging bioethical concerns. Central concerns include power dynamics, exclusion, and misrepresentation. We propose adopting a relational bioethical approach that advocates for a comprehensive assessment of DTs in medicine, extending beyond individual interactions to consider broader structural relations and varying levels of access to power. This can be achieved through two key relational recommendations: acknowledging the impact of uneven relational structures on access to medical care and promoting social justice by evaluating resource allocation. While DTs in medicine offer promising advancements, a relational bioethical lens may provide a nuanced understanding, fostering equitable, inclusive and responsible integration of DTs into medical practice.",

Although methods have been proposed to generate virtual patient populations using mechanistic models, there are limited number of applications in immuno-oncology research. Furthermore, due to the stricter requirements of digital twins, they are often generated in a study-specific manner with models customized to particular clinical settings (e.g., treatment, cancer, and data types). Here, we discuss the challenges for virtual patient generation in immuno-oncology with our most recent experiences, initiatives to develop digital twins, and how research on these two concepts can inform each other.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor FOXN1 plays an established role in thymic epithelial development to mediate selection of maturing thymocytes. Patients with heterozygous loss-of-function FOXN1 variants are associated with T cell lymphopenia at birth and low TCR excision circles that can ultimately recover. Although CD4+ T cell reconstitution in these patients is not completely understood, a lower proportion of naive T cells in adults has suggested a role for homeostatic proliferation. In this study, we present an immunophenotyping study of fraternal twins with low TCR excision circles at birth. Targeted primary immunodeficiency testing revealed a heterozygous variant of uncertain significance in FOXN1 (c.1205del, p.Pro402Leufs*148). We present the immune phenotypes of these two patients, as well as their father who carries the same FOXN1 variant, to demonstrate an evolving immune environment over time. While FOXN1 haploinsufficiency may contribute to thymic defects and T cell lymphopenia, we characterized the transcriptional activity and DNA binding of the heterozygous FOXN1 variant in 293T cells and found the FOXN1 variant to have different effects across several target genes. These data suggest multiple mechanisms for similar FOXN1 variants pathogenicity that may be mutation specific. Increased understanding of how these variants drive transcriptional regulation to impact immune cell populations will guide the potential need for therapeutics, risk for infection or autoimmunity over time, and help inform clinical decisions for other variants that might arise.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, the mechanical response and deformation behavior of a Mg AZ31 plate with different types of pre-twins was systematically investigated under biaxial tension along the normal direction (ND) and transverse direction (TD) with different stress ratios. The results show that significant hardening was observed under biaxial tension. The yield values in the direction of larger stress values were higher than those under uniaxial loading conditions, and the solute atom segregation at twin boundaries generates more obvious strengthening effect. Noting that, for TRH (with cross compression along the rolling direction (RD) and TD and annealing at 180 \u00b0C for about 0.5 h) sample, the strength effect of the RD yield stress \u03c3RD:\u03c3ND = 2:1 was higher than that of the ND yield stress under stress ratio \u03c3RD:\u03c3ND = 1:2. There is a complex competition between twinning and detwinning under biaxal tension along the ND and TD of the pre-twinned samples with the variation in the stress ratio along the TD and RD. The variation in the twin volume fractions for all samples under biaxial firstly decreases and then increases with a higher stress ratio along the ND. As for the TDH sample (precompression along the TD and annealing), the changes of the twin volume fraction were lower than that of the TR sample (cross compression along the TD and RD). However, the amplitude of variation in twin volume fraction of the TRH sample is higher than that of the TR sample. This is because the relative activity of detwinning decreases and that of twinning increases, as the ND stress mainly leads to the growth of pre-twins and the TD stress often promotes detwinning of primary twins. With a higher stress ratio along the ND, the activity of twinning deformation increases and that of detwinning decreases.",

    "abstract": "Cell level functions underlie tissue and organ physiology. Gene expression patterns offer extensive views of the pathways and processes within and between cells. Single cell transcriptomics provides detailed information on gene expression within cells, cell types, subtypes and their relative proportions in organs. Functional pathways can be scalably connected to physiological functions at the cell and organ levels. Integrating experimentally obtained gene expression patterns with prior knowledge of pathway interactions enables identification of networks underlying whole cell functions such as growth, contractility, and secretion. These pathways can be computationally modeled using differential equations to simulate cell and organ physiological dynamics regulated by gene expression changes. Such computational systems can be thought of as parts of digital twins of organs. Digital twins, at the core, need computational models that represent in detail and simulate how dynamics of pathways and networks give rise to whole cell level physiological functions. Integration of transcriptomic responses and numerical simulations could simulate and predict whole cell functional outputs from transcriptomic data. We developed a computational pipeline that integrates gene expression timelines and systems of coupled differential equations to generate cell-type selective dynamical models. We tested our integrative algorithm on the eicosanoid biosynthesis network in macrophages. Converting transcriptomic changes to a dynamical model allowed us to predict dynamics of prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis and secretion by macrophages that matched published lipidomics data obtained in the same experiments. Integration of cell-level system biology simulations with genomic and clinical data using a knowledge graph framework will allow us to create explicit predictive models that mechanistically link genomic determinants to organ function. Such integration requires a multi-domain ontological framework to connect genomic determinants to gene expression and cell pathways and functions to organ level phenotypes in healthy and diseased states. These integrated scalable models of tissues and organs as accurate digital twins predict health and disease states for precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic clocks were known as promising biomarkers of aging, including original clocks trained by individual CpG sites and principal component (PC) clocks trained by PCs of CpG sites. The effects of genetic and environmental factors on epigenetic clocks are still unclear, especially for PC clocks.\nWe constructed univariate twin models in 477 same-sex twin pairs from the Chinese National Twin Registry (CNTR) to estimate the heritability of five epigenetic clocks (GrimAge, PhenoAge, DunedinPACE, PCGrimAge, and PCPhenoAge). Besides, we investigated the longitudinal changes of genetic and environmental influences on epigenetic clocks across 5\u00a0years in 134 same-sex twin pairs.\nHeritability of epigenetic clocks ranged from 0.45 to 0.70, and those for PC clocks were higher than those for original clocks. For five epigenetic clocks, the longitudinal stability was moderate to high and was largely due to genetic effects. The genetic correlations between baseline and follow-up epigenetic clocks were moderate to high. Special unique environmental factors emerged both at baseline and at follow-up. PC clocks showed higher longitudinal stability and unique environmental correlations than original clocks.\nFor five epigenetic clocks, they have the potential to identify aging interventions. High longitudinal stability is mainly due to genetic factors, and changes of epigenetic clocks over time are primarily due to changes in unique environmental factors. Given the disparities in genetic and environmental factors as well as longitudinal stability between PC and original clocks, the results of studies with original clocks need to be further verified with PC clocks.",

    "abstract": "Transdermal drug delivery is suitable for low-molecular-weight drugs with specific lipophilicity, like fentanyl, which is widely used for cancer-induced pain management. However, fentanyl's transdermal therapy displays high intra-individual variability. Factors like skin characteristics at application sites and ambient temperature contribute to this variation. In this study, we developed a physics-based digital twin of the human body to cope with this variability and propose better adapted setups. This twin includes an in-silico skin model for drug penetration, a pharmacokinetic model, and a pharmacodynamic model. Based on the results of our simulations, applying the patch on the flank (side abdominal area) showed a 15.3 % higher maximum fentanyl concentration in the plasma than on the chest. Additionally, the time to reach this maximum concentration when delivered through the flank was 19.8 h, which was 10.3 h earlier than via the upper arm. Finally, this variation led to an 18 % lower minimum pain intensity for delivery via the flank than the chest. Moreover, the impact of seasonal changes on ambient temperature and skin temperature by considering the activity level was investigated. Based on our result, the fentanyl uptake flux by capillaries increased by up to 11.8 % from an inactive state in winter to an active state in summer. We also evaluated the effect of controlling fentanyl delivery by adjusting the temperature of the patch to alleviate the pain to reach a mild pain intensity (rated three on the VAS scale). By implementing this strategy, the average pain intensity decreased by 1.1 points, and the standard deviation for fentanyl concentration in plasma and average pain intensity reduced by 37.5 % and 33.3 %, respectively. Therefore, our digital twin demonstrated the efficacy of controlled drug release through temperature regulation, ensuring the therapy toward the intended target outcome and reducing therapy outcome variability. This holds promise as a potentially useful tool for physicians.",

During her IVF cycle, the patient was stimulated with an antagonist protocol for 13 days followed by a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist trigger. 13 eggs were retrieved, 9 were mature and 5 fertilised with intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Of those, two were cryopreserved. She had a successful frozen blastocyst embryo transfer. The patient's 7-week ultrasound demonstrated a single gestational sac, yolk sac and fetal pole. However, the crown-rump length appeared visually abnormal and two heartbeats were visualised. She was referred to maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) for a first-trimester ultrasound. Her ultrasound with MFM was notable for a fluid-filled chest, foreshortened limbs and early sacral agenesis. She was subsequently diagnosed with cephalopagus twins and underwent an induced abortion following consultation with MFM.",

    "abstract": "Efficient specialized vehicle cooperative scheduling is significant for airport operations, particularly during times of high traffic, which reduces the risk of flight delays and increases customer satisfaction. In this paper,we construct a multi-type vehicles collaborative scheduling model with the objectives of minimizing vehicle travel distance and vehicle waiting time. Additionally, a three-layer genetic algorithm is designed, and the crossover and mutation operations are enhanced to address the scheduling model. Due to the numerous uncertainties and stochastic interferences in airport operations, conventional scheduling methods unable to effectively address these challenges, this paper combines improved genetic algorithm, simulation algorithm, and digital twins technology, proposing a multi-strategy scheduling framework for specialized vehicles based on digital twins. The scheduling framework utilises digital twins to capture dynamic data from the airport and continuously adjusts the scheduling plan through the scheduling strategy to ensure robust scheduling for specialized vehicles. In the event of severe delays at the airport, fast and efficient re-scheduling can be achieved. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling framework is validated using domestic flight data, and extensive experiments and analyses are conducted in different scenarios. This research contributes to addressing the optimization problem of cooperative scheduling for multi-type vehicles at airports.",

    "abstract": "Social science research argues that differences in individuals' literary and cultural tastes originate in social environments. Yet, it might be that these differences are partly associated with genetic differences between individuals. To address this possibility, we use nation-scale registry data on library borrowing among Danish twins (N = 67,900) to assess the heritability of literary tastes. We measure literary tastes via borrowing of books of different genres (e.g., crime and biographical novels) and formats (physical, digital, and audio) and decompose the total variance in literary tastes into components attributable to shared genes (heritability), shared environments (social environment shared by siblings), and unique environments (social environments not shared by siblings). We find that genetic differences account for 45-70 percent of the total variance in literary tastes, shared environments account for almost none of the variance, and unique environments account for a moderate share. These results suggest that literary tastes are approximately as heritable as other human phenotypes (e.g., physical traits, cognition, and health). Moreover, heritability is higher for socioeconomically disadvantaged groups than for advantaged groups. Overall, our results suggest that research should consider the role of genetic differences in accounting for individual differences in literary and broader cultural tastes.",

    "abstract": "To systematically review the literature regarding the concordance of sleep bruxism (SB) between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins.\nThe registration for this systematic review was accomplished in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, No. CRD42021251751). As of July 2022, four databases were searched, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science, as well as the grey literature in Google Scholar and OpenGrey. Observational studies evaluating SB in MZ and DZ twins of any age and sex were included. For the evaluation of the risk of bias, the Joanna Briggs checklist was utilized. The certainty of evidence was assessed via the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Pooled and subgroup meta-analyses were performed to estimate concordance of SB \u200b\u200bbetween twins (p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nIn total, 3,155 records were identified. In the qualitative analysis, eleven studies were included; of these, seven were included in the meta-analysis. The majority of the articles exhibited a low risk of bias (63.6%). Greater SB concordance was observed between MZ twins than between DZ twins in the analysis of general concordance (OR\u2009=\u20091.47; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.07-2.02) and also positive concordance (OR\u2009=\u20091.53; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.29-1.81). Within the subgroup analyses, the significance of the findings remained only for the reported/self-reported SB regarding general concordance (OR\u2009=\u20091.44; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.07-1.95) and positive concordance (OR\u2009=\u20091.55; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.28-1.88). Low certainty of the evidence was observed for the general concordance analysis, while moderate certainty was observed for the positive concordance.\nThere was a higher concordance of SB in MZ twins compared to DZ twins, indicating a possible genetic influence on the condition's occurrence.",

    "abstract": "Biallelic pathogenic variants in CCN6 cause progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPD), a rare skeletal dysplasia. The predominant features include noninflammatory progressive joint stiffness and enlargement, which are not unique to this condition. Nearly 100% of the reported variants are single nucleotide variants or small indels, and missing of a second variant has been reported. Genome sequencing (GS) covers various types of variants and deep phenotyping (DP) provides detailed and precise information facilitating genetic data interpretation. The combination of GS and DP improves diagnostic yield, especially in rare and undiagnosed diseases. We identified a novel compound heterozygote involving a disease-causing copy number variant (g.112057664_112064205del) in trans with a single nucleotide variant (c.624dup(p.Cys209MetfsTer21)) in CCN6 in a pair of monozygotic twins, through the methods of GS and DP. The twins had received three nondiagnostic results before. The g.112057664_112064205del variant was missed by all the tests, and the recorded phenotypes were inaccurate or even misleading. The twins were diagnosed with PPD, ending a 13-year diagnostic odyssey. There may be other patients with PPD experiencing underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis due to inadequate genetic testing or phenotyping methods. This case highlights the critical role of GS and DP in facilitating an accurate and timely diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "We present the case of a 36-year-old female who was diagnosed at birth with CHI that caused severe hypoglycaemia unresponsive to Diazoxide. Subtotal pancreatectomy was performed at the age of three weeks. Later, histological analysis of her pancreas in a research setting revealed a focal form of CHI. Genetic testing was not available at that time. The patient developed pancreatic exocrine deficiency and insulin-dependent diabetes at the age of 9 years. In 2016, a genetic test revealed a missense heterozygous variant in the ABCC8 gene inherited from her father and classified as having a recessive inheritance. The geneticist concluded that the risk of CHI for her offspring would be low (1/600), making pregnancy favourable. As there was no consanguinity in the family, testing the future father was deemed unnecessary (carrier frequency 1/150 in the general population). The pregnancy occurred spontaneously in 2020 and at a gestational age of 28 weeks, the mother went into premature labour. An emergency C-section was performed in April 2021 resulting in the birth of bichorial bi-amniotic male twins. Following birth, both newborns experienced persistent severe hypoglycaemia which required glucagon treatment and intravenous glucose infusion initially, followed by Diazoxide from day 51 after birth, without satisfactory response. Continuous intravenous Octreotide treatment was introduced on day 72. Due to the recurrence of hypoglycaemia episodes despite reaching maximum doses of Octreotide, from day 92 the treatment was switched to Pasireotide. Genetic tests revealed the same genotypes for both infants: the exon 39 missense variant (c.4716C>A; p.Ser1572Arg) inherited from their mother and a truncating variant in exon 28 (c.3550del; p.Val1184*), inherited from their asymptomatic father. As a result of inheriting two recessive variants of the ABCC8 gene, the children were diagnosed with a diffuse form of CHI, consistent with the diazoxide-unresponsive presentation. This situation is very rare outside consanguinity. This case emphasises the significance of genetic counselling for individuals with a history of rare diseases outside the context of consanguinity, as there is a potential risk of recurrence. Prenatal diagnosis can lead to better outcomes for affected neonates, as well as help families make informed decisions about future pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) is a rapidly developing field of nuclear medicine, with several RPTs already well established in the treatment of several different types of cancers. However, the current approaches to RPTs often follow a somewhat inflexible \"one size fits all\" paradigm, where patients are administered the same amount of radioactivity per cycle regardless of their individual characteristics and features. This approach fails to consider inter-patient variations in radiopharmacokinetics, radiation biology, and immunological factors, which can significantly impact treatment outcomes. To address this limitation, we propose the development of theranostic digital twins (TDTs) to personalize RPTs based on actual patient data. Our proposed roadmap outlines the steps needed to create and refine TDTs that can optimize radiation dose to tumors while minimizing toxicity to organs at risk. The TDT models incorporate physiologically-based radiopharmacokinetic (PBRPK) models, which are additionally linked to a radiobiological optimizer and an immunological modulator, taking into account factors that influence RPT response. By using TDT models, we envisage the ability to perform virtual clinical trials, selecting therapies towards improved treatment outcomes while minimizing risks associated with secondary effects. This framework could empower practitioners to ultimately develop tailored RPT solutions for subgroups and individual patients, thus improving the precision, accuracy, and efficacy of treatments while minimizing risks to patients. By incorporating TDT models into RPTs, we can pave the way for a new era of precision medicine in cancer treatment",

    "abstract": "Pediatric loss-of-control (LOC) eating is associated with high BMI and predicts binge-eating disorder and obesity onset with age. Research on the etiology of this common comorbidity has not explored the potential for shared genetic risk. This study examined genetic and environmental influences on LOC eating and its shared influence with BMI.\nParticipants were 499 monozygotic and 398 same-sex dizygotic twins (age\u2009=\u200917.38\u2009years\u2009\u00b1\u20090.67, BMIz\u2009=\u20090.03\u2009\u00b1\u20091.03, 54% female) from the Colorado Center for Antisocial Drug Dependence Study. LOC eating was assessed dichotomously. Self-reported height and weight were converted to BMIz. Univariate and bivariate twin models estimated genetic and environmental influences on LOC eating and BMIz.\nMore girls (21%) than boys (9%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) reported LOC eating. The phenotypic correlation with BMIz was 0.03 in girls and 0.18 in boys. Due to the nonsignificant phenotypic correlation in girls, bivariate twin models were fit in boys only. Across all models, the best-fitting model included genetic and unique environmental effects. Genetic factors accounted for 0.51 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.73) of the variance of LOC eating in girls and 0.54 (0.18, 0.90) in boys. The genetic correlation between LOC eating and BMIz in boys was 0.45 (0.15, 0.75).\nFindings indicate moderate heritability of LOC eating in adolescence, while emphasizing the role of unique environmental factors. In boys, LOC eating and BMIz share a proportion of their genetic influences.",

    "abstract": "Ventricular tachycardia (VT), which can lead to sudden cardiac death, occurs frequently in patients after myocardial infarction. Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) is a modestly effective treatment of VT, but it has limitations and risks. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-based heart digital twins have emerged as a useful tool for identifying VT circuits for RFA treatment planning. However, the CMR resolution used to reconstruct these digital twins may impact VT circuit predictions, leading to incorrect RFA treatment planning.\nThis study sought to predict RFA targets in the arrhythmogenic substrate using heart digital twins reconstructed from both clinical and high-resolution 2-dimensional CMR datasets and compare the predictions.\nHigh-resolution (1.35\u00a0\u00d7 1.35\u00a0\u00d7 3\u00a0mm), or oversampled resolution (Ov-Res), short-axis late gadolinium-enhanced CMR was acquired by combining 2 subsequent clinical resolution (Clin-Res) (1.35\u00a0\u00d7 1.35\u00a0\u00d7 6\u00a0mm) short-axis late gadolinium-enhanced CMR scans from 6 post-myocardial infarction patients undergoing VT ablation and used to reconstruct a total of 3 digital twins (1 Ov-Res, 2 Clin-Res) for each patient. Rapid pacing was used to assess VT circuits and identify the optimal ablation targets in each digital twin. VT circuits predicted by the digital twins were compared with intraprocedural electroanatomic mapping data and used to identify emergent VT.\nThe Ov-Res digital twins reduced partial volume effects and better predicted unique VT circuits compared with the Clin-Res digital twins (66.6% vs 54.5%; P\u00a0< 0.01). Only the Ov-Res digital twin successfully identified emergent VT after a failed initial ablation.\nDigital twin infarct geometry and VT circuit predictions depend on the magnetic resonance resolution. Ov-Res digital twins better predict VT circuits and emergent VT, which may improve RFA outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The limited data regarding obstetrical outcomes in multiple pregnancies following both fresh embryo transfer and frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET), along with the association between multiple pregnancies and increased pregnancy complications compared to singleton pregnancies, highlight the need for research on this topic. Therefore, this study aimed to compare obstetrical and neonatal outcomes of twin pregnancies after fresh embryo transfer versus FET.\nThis was a retrospective single-center study.\nThere were in vitro fertilization (IVF) dichorionic twin pregnancies \u226523 weeks of gestation during 2010-2022.\nThis retrospective study was based on data recorded at Galilee Medical Center, a tertiary-care university-affiliated hospital, Israel.\nWe conducted a comparative analysis of obstetrical and neonatal outcomes between IVF dichorionic twin pregnancies after fresh embryo transfer and those after FET. This analysis included variables such as gestational age at delivery, birthweight, preterm birth rates, low birthweight rates, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, and complications related to prematurity.\nThe study included 389 IVF twin pregnancies: 253 after fresh embryo transfer and 136 after FET. Following fresh embryo transfer compared to FET, the mean gestational age at delivery was earlier (34 + 6 vs. 35 + 5 weeks, p = 0.001) and the rate of preterm birth (<37 weeks) was higher (70.4% vs. 53.7%, p = 0.001). This difference in gestational age at delivery remained significant after adjustment for maternal age, parity, and BMI (OR = 2.11, 95% CI: 2.11-3.27, p = 0.001). Similarly, the difference in preterm birth rates remained significant after adjustment of the same variables (p = 0.001). For the fresh embryo transfer compared to the FET group, the mean birthweight was lower (2,179.72 vs. 2,353.35 g, p = 0.003); and low birthweight and very low birthweight rates were higher (71.2% vs. 56.3%, p < 0.001 and 13.5% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.004, respectively). For the fresh embryo transfer compared to the FET group, the proportions were higher of neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (23.3% vs. 16.0%, p = 0.019), of neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (10.5% vs. 5.9%, p = 0.045) and those needing phototherapy (23.3% vs. 16.0%, p = 0.019).\nLimitations of the study include its retrospective nature. Furthermore, we were unable to adjust for some confounders, such as the number of eggs retrieved, the number of embryos transferred, and methods for ovarian stimulation or preparation of the endometrium for embryo transfer.\nObstetrical and neonatal outcomes of twin pregnancies were worse after fresh embryo transfer than after FET. The findings support favorable fetal outcomes after FET and support the current trend of shifting from fresh embryo transfer to FET. Prospective studies are needed to support our results.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of autism has been increasing at an alarming rate. Even accounting for the expansion of autism spectrum disorder diagnostic (ASD) criteria throughout the 1990's, there has been an over 300% increase in ASD prevalence since the year 2000. The often debilitating personal, familial, and societal sequelae of autism are generally believed to be lifelong. However, there have been several encouraging case reports demonstrating the reversal of autism diagnoses, with a therapeutic focus on addressing the environmental and modifiable lifestyle factors believed to be largely underlying the condition. This case report describes the reversal of autism symptoms among dizygotic, female twin toddlers and provides a review of related literature describing associations between modifiable lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, and various clinical approaches to treating autism. The twins were diagnosed with Level 3 severity ASD \"requiring very substantial support\" at approximately 20 months of age following concerns of limited verbal and non-verbal communication, repetitive behaviors, rigidity around transitions, and extensive gastrointestinal symptoms, among other common symptoms. A parent-driven, multidisciplinary, therapeutic intervention involving a variety of licensed clinicians focusing primarily on addressing environmental and modifiable lifestyle factors was personalized to each of the twin's symptoms, labs, and other outcome measures. Dramatic improvements were noted within several months in most domains of the twins' symptoms, which manifested in reductions of Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) scores from 76 to 32 in one of the twins and from 43 to 4 in the other twin. The improvement in symptoms and ATEC scores has remained relatively stable for six months at last assessment. While prospective studies are required, this case offers further encouraging evidence of ASD reversal through a personalized, multidisciplinary approach focusing predominantly on addressing modifiable environmental and lifestyle risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins are a relatively new form of digital modeling that has been gaining popularity in recent years. This is in large part due to their ability to update in real time to their physical counterparts and connect across multiple devices. As a result, much interest has been directed towards using digital twins in the healthcare industry. Recent advancements in smart wearable technologies have allowed for the utilization of human digital twins in healthcare. Human digital twins can be generated using biometric data from the patient gathered from wearables. These data can then be used to enhance patient care through a variety of means, such as simulated clinical trials, disease prediction, and monitoring treatment progression remotely. This revolutionary method of patient care is still in its infancy, and as such, there is limited research on using wearables to generate human digital twins for healthcare applications. This paper reviews the literature pertaining to human digital twins, including methods, applications, and challenges. The paper also presents a conceptual method for creating human body digital twins using wearable sensors.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies are associated with a high risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity. Late preterm or early term delivery is frequently performed to avoid unexpected fetal death in uncomplicated twin pregnancies. Nonetheless, delivery before full term is associated with neonatal respiratory complications. This study aimed to evaluate perinatal respiratory complications in twins delivered between 36 and 38\u2009weeks of gestation.\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted on twins delivered between 36 and 38\u2009weeks of gestation from January 2008 to June 2020. The primary outcomes were the incidence of composite neonatal respiratory morbidity, which included respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea of the newborn, meconium aspiration syndrome, mechanical ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure according to gestational age at delivery, and chorionicity. The relationship between gestational age at delivery and composite neonatal respiratory morbidity was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders.\nThis study included 1608 twins (614 monochorionic diamniotic twins, 994 dichorionic diamniotic twins). At 36, 37, and 38\u2009weeks of gestation, the frequencies of composite neonatal respiratory morbidity were 19.4%, 10.7%, and 9.2% in dichorionic diamniotic twins and 13.6%, 8.7%, and 9.4% in monochorionic diamniotic twins, respectively. In dichorionic diamniotic twins, the composite neonatal respiratory morbidity rate was higher for twins delivered at 36\u2009weeks of gestation than for those delivered at 37\u2009weeks. No significant differences between monochorionic diamniotic twins were detected.\nIn uncomplicated dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies, delivery should be considered after 37\u2009weeks of gestation to reduce neonatal respiratory complications.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common condition in older adult (aged >65 years) populations, but more mechanistic research is needed to individualize treatments. Previous evidence has suggested an association between OSA and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but is limited by possible selection bias. High-quality research on this association with a careful evaluation of possible confounders may yield important mechanistic insight into both conditions and improve treatment efforts.\nTo investigate the association of current PTSD symptoms and PTSD diagnosis with OSA.\nThis cross-sectional study of twin pairs discordant for PTSD, which allows for adjustment for familial factors, was conducted using in-laboratory polysomnography from March 20, 2017, to June 3, 2019. The study sample comprised male veteran twins recruited from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. The data analysis was performed between June 11, 2022, and January 30, 2023.\nSymptoms of PTSD in twins who served in the Vietnam War. Diagnosis of PTSD was a secondary exposure.\nObstructive sleep apnea was assessed using the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (\u22654% oxygen saturation criterion as measured by events per hour) with overnight polysomnography. Symptoms of PTSD were assessed using the PTSD Checklist (PCL) and structured clinical interview for PTSD diagnosis.\nA total of 181 male twins (mean [SD] age, 68.4 [2.0] years) including 66 pairs discordant for PTSD symptoms and 15 pairs discordant for a current PTSD diagnosis were evaluated. In models examining the PCL and OSA within pairs and adjusted for body mass index (BMI) and other sociodemographic, cardiovascular, and psychiatric risk factors (including depression), each 15-point increase in PCL was associated with a 4.6 (95% CI, 0.1-9.1) events-per-hour higher AHI. Current PTSD diagnosis was associated with an adjusted 10.5 (95% CI, 5.7-15.3) events-per-hour higher AHI per sleep-hour. Comparable standardized estimates of the association of PTSD symptoms and BMI with AHI per SD increase (1.9 events per hour; 95% CI, 0.5-3.3 events per hour) were found.\nThis cross-sectional study found an association between PTSD and sleep-disordered breathing. The findings have important public health implications and may also enhance understanding of the many factors that potentially affect OSA pathophysiology.",

    "results": "A total of 181 male twins (mean [SD] age, 68.4 [2.0] years) including 66 pairs discordant for PTSD symptoms and 15 pairs discordant for a current PTSD diagnosis were evaluated. In models examining the PCL and OSA within pairs and adjusted for body mass index (BMI) and other sociodemographic, cardiovascular, and psychiatric risk factors (including depression), each 15-point increase in PCL was associated with a 4.6 (95% CI, 0.1-9.1) events-per-hour higher AHI. Current PTSD diagnosis was associated with an adjusted 10.5 (95% CI, 5.7-15.3) events-per-hour higher AHI per sleep-hour. Comparable standardized estimates of the association of PTSD symptoms and BMI with AHI per SD increase (1.9 events per hour; 95% CI, 0.5-3.3 events per hour) were found.",

    "abstract": "The advent of digital twins facilitates the generation of high-fidelity replicas of actual systems or assets, thereby enhancing the design's performance and feasibility. When developing digital twins, precise measurement data is essential to ensure alignment between the actual and digital models. However, inherent uncertainties in sensors and models lead to disparities between observed and predicted (simulated) behaviors. To mitigate these uncertainties, this study originally proposes a multi-objective optimization strategy utilizing a Gaussian process regression surrogate model, which integrates various uncertain parameters, such as load angle, bucket cylinder stroke, arm cylinder stroke, and boom cylinder stroke. This optimization employs a genetic algorithm to indicate the Pareto frontiers regarding the pressure exerted on the boom, arm, and bucket cylinders. Subsequently, TOPSIS is applied to ascertain the optimal candidate among the identified Pareto optima. The findings reveal a substantial congruence between the experimental and numerical outcomes of the devised virtual model, in conjunction with the TOPSIS-derived optimal parameter configuration.",

    "abstract": "Maternal laparotomy-assisted fetoscopic surgery for in-utero myelomeningocele repair has shown that a trans-amniotic membrane suture during fetoscopic port placement can reduce postsurgical complications. Fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (FLP) for complex twins is typically performed percutaneously without a transmembrane stitch. However, in scenarios without a placental-free window, maternal laparotomy may be used for recipient sac access. Here, we present the outcomes of our series of laparotomy-assisted FLP cases, including a trans-amniotic membrane suturing of the fetoscopic port.\nRetrospective series of twin-twin transfusion syndrome or twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS) cases treated at 2 fetal centers that underwent maternal laparotomy to FLP from September 2017 to January 2023. We recorded preoperative and operative characteristics, as well as pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.\nDuring the study period, 9 maternal laparotomy to FLP cases were performed. Two were excluded for prior percutaneous FLP in the pregnancy. The remaining seven utilized a maternal laparotomy to trans-amniotic membrane stitch with confirmation of proper suture placement under ultrasound guidance, and all surgeries were performed with a single 10 F Check-Flo\u00ae cannula. Mean gestational age (GA) at surgery was 19.1 weeks (range 16 weeks 4 days-23 weeks 3 days), with delivery occurring at a mean GA of 35.0 weeks (range 32 weeks 0 days-37 weeks 1 day), resulting in a mean latency of 15.8 weeks, significantly longer than what is reported in the literature and our own data (mean latency for percutaneous FLP 10.2, 95% CI 9.9-10.5). Furthermore, all cases underwent iatrogenic delivery before labor onset, with the lone delivery prior to 34 weeks due to concern for post-laser TAPS.\nThis case series of laparotomy to FLP with trans-amniotic stitch, demonstrated no cases of spontaneous preterm birth and a longer-than-expected latency from surgery to delivery. Larger studies are warranted to investigate this approach.",

    "abstract": "Digital twin is a new concept that is rapidly gaining recognition especially in the medical field. Indeed, being a virtual representation of real-world entities and processes, a digital twin can be used to accurately represent the patients' disease, clarify the treatment target, and realize personalized and precise therapies. However, despite being a revolutionary concept, the diffusion of digital twins in type 1 diabetes (T1D) is still limited. In this systematic review, we analyzed structure, operating conditions, and characteristics of digital twins being developed for T1D. Our search covered published documents until March 2024: 220 publications were identified, 37 of which were duplicated entries; in addition, 173 publications were removed after inspection of titles, abstracts, and keywords; and finally, 11 publications were fully reviewed, of which 8 were deemed eligible for inclusion. We found that all eight methodologies are not comprehensive multi-scale virtual replicas of the individual with T1D, but they all focus on describing glucose-insulin metabolism, aiming to simulate glucose concentration resultant from therapeutic interventions. In this review, we will compare and analyze different factors characterizing these digital twins, such as operating principles (mathematical model, twinning procedure, validation and assessment) and the key aspects for practical adoption (inclusion of physical activity, data required for twinning, open-source availability). We will conclude the paper listing which, in our opinion, are the current limitations and future directives of digital twins in T1D, hoping that this article can be helpful to researchers working on diabetes technologies to further develop the use of such an important instrument.",

    "abstract": "Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) complicates approximately 10%-15% of all monochorionic twin pregnancies. The aim of this review was to evaluate the placental architectural characteristics within TTTS twins following laser and elucidate their impact on fetal outcomes and operative success.\nFive databases were searched from inception to August 2023. Studies detailing post-delivery placental analysis within TTTS twins post-laser were included. Studies were categorized into two main groups: (1) residual anastomoses following laser and (2) abnormal cord insertion: either velamentous and/or marginal or proximate. The primary outcome was to determine the proportion of TTTS placentas with residual anastomoses and abnormal cord insertions post-laser. Secondary outcomes included assessing residual anastomoses on post-laser fetal outcomes and assessing the relationship between abnormal cord insertion and TTTS development. Study bias was critiqued using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklists and Cochrane risk of bias tool. Random-effects meta-analysis was used, and results were reported as pooled proportions or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). PROSPERO registration: CRD42023476875.\nTwenty-six studies, comprising 4013 monochorionic twins, were included for analysis. The proportion of TTTS placentas with residual anastomoses following laser was 24% (95% CI, 0.12-0.41), with a mean and standard deviation of 4.03\u2009\u00b1\u20092.95 anastomoses per placenta. Post-laser residual anastomoses were significantly associated with intrauterine fetal death (OR, 2.38 [95% CI, 1.33-4.26]), neonatal death (OR, 3.37 [95% CI, 1.65-6.88]), recurrent TTTS (OR, 24.33 [95% CI, 6.64-89.12]), and twin anemia polycythemia sequence (OR, 13.54 [95% CI, 6.36-28.85]). Combined abnormal cord (velamentous and marginal), velamentous cord, and marginal cord insertions within one or both twins following laser were reported at rates of 49% (95% CI, 0.39-0.59), 27% (95% CI, 0.18-0.38), and 28% (95% CI, 0.21-0.36), respectively. Combined, velamentous and marginal cord insertions were not significantly associated with TTTS twins requiring laser (p\u2009=\u20090.72, p\u2009=\u20090.38, and p\u2009=\u20090.71, respectively) vs non-TTTS monochorionic twins.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first review to conjointly explore outcomes of residual anastomoses and abnormal cord insertions within TTTS twins following laser. A large prospective study is necessitated to assess the relationship between abnormal cord insertion and residual anastomoses development post-laser.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins occur in an estimated one in every 200,000 live births. The etiology remains largely speculative, with genetic and environmental factors being considered. The thoraco-omphalopagus type accounts for approximately 40% of cases, making it a focal point for clinical and radiological research. Radiological imaging plays a pivotal role in delineating anatomical details, offering insights into the feasibility of surgical interventions and informing parental counselling regarding prognosis and management options. We present a case of thoracoomphalogus conjoined twins diagnosed during the third trimester of pregnancy in a 19-year-old woman. The detailed radiological assessment using ultra-sound and MRI provided crucial information on organ sharing and vascular anatomy, which is critical for management strategies. This case underscores the critical role of prenatal imaging in detecting complex congenital anomalies, facilitating informed decision-making by healthcare providers and families.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins cannot be distinguished using conventional forensic STR typing because they present identical STR genotypings. However, MZ twins do not always live in the same environment and often have different dietary and other lifestyle habits. Metabolic profiles are deyermined by individual characteristics and are also influenced by the environment in which they live. Therefore, they are potential markers capable of identifying MZ twins. Moreover, the production of proteins varies from organism to organism and is influenced by both the physiological state of the body and the external environment. Hence, we used metabolomics and proteomics to identify metabolites and proteins in peripheral blood to discriminate MZ twins. We identified 1749 known metabolites and 622 proteins in proteomic analysis. The metabolic profiles of four pairs of MZ twins revealed minor differences in intra-MZ twins and major differences in inter-MZ twins. Each pair of MZ twins exhibited distinct characteristics, and four metabolites-methyl picolinate, acesulfame, paraxanthine, and phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid-were observed in all four MZ twin pairs. These four differential exogenous metabolites conincidently show that the different external environments and life styles can be well distinguished by metabolites, considering that twins do not all have the same eating habits and living environments. Moreover, MZ twins showed different protein profiles in serum but not in whole blood. Thus, our results indicate that differential metabolites provide potential biomarkers for the personal identification of MZ twins in forensic medicine.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of highly adaptable and reusable artificial intelligence models facilitates the implementation of digital twinning and has the potential to redefine cardiovascular risk prevention. Digital twinning combines vast amounts of data from diverse sources to construct virtual models of an individual. Emerging artificial intelligence models, called generalist AI, enable the processing of different types of data, including data from electronic health records, laboratory results, medical texts, imaging, genomics, or graphs. Among their unprecedented capabilities are an easy adaptation of a model to previously unseen medical tasks and the ability to reason and explain output using precise medical language derived from scientific literature, medical guidelines, or knowledge graphs. The proposed combination of a digital twinning approach with generalist AI is a path to accelerate the implementation of precision medicine and enhance early recognition and prevention of cardiovascular disease. This proposed strategy may extend to other domains to advance predictive, preventive, and precision medicine and also boost health research discoveries.",

    "abstract": "Research has found that twins and multiples are less likely to be breastfed than singleton babies. Exploration of the experience of breastfeeding twins and multiples from parents' perspectives is limited, and we know little about the experiences of those who breastfeed twins and multiples and the possible barriers they face.\nThe aim of the research was to explore experiences of breastfeeding twins and multiples in the UK from the perspective of birthing parents.\nA qualitative online survey was carried out (n = 94), followed by online semi-structured interviews (n = 18). The data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.\nFour themes were developed from the data: (1) \"It's one of the things I'm most proud of in my life\" (2) The importance of support: \"it definitely takes a village with twins\" (3) Barriers and the pressure to formula feed: \"all they wanted to do was stuff 'em full of formula\" and (4) The dynamic experience of breastfeeding twins.\nMany of the participants were able to feed their babies in part due to sheer determination and the refusal to give up when met with challenges. Breastfeeding was an important part of their identity as a mother, however mental health was often impacted by their experiences, as well as the challenges they faced when seeking support.\nBreastfeeding twins and multiples is a challenging yet rewarding experience. Our findings indicate that further training and support is needed to enable healthcare providers to support parents of twins on their breastfeeding journey.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a complex disease with a spectrum of outcomes for more than six decades; however, the genomic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the highly heritable susceptibility to TB remain unclear.\nIntegrated sequence-based genomic, transcriptomic, and methylation analyses were conducted to identity the genetic factors associated with susceptibility to TB in two pairs of Mongolian monozygous twins. In this study, whole-genome sequencing was employed to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions (InDels), and copy number variations (CNVs). Gene expression was assessed through RNA sequencing, and methylation patterns were examined using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip. The gene-gene interaction network was analyzed using differentially expressed genes.\nOur study revealed no significant difference in SNP and InDel profiles between participants with and without TB. Genes with CNVs were involved in human immunity (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] family and interferon [IFN] pathway) and the inflammatory response. Different DNA methylation patterns and mRNA expression profiles were observed in genes participating in immunity (HLA family) and inflammatory responses (IFNA, interleukin 10 receptor [IL-10R], IL-12B, Toll-like receptor, and IL-1B).\nThe results of this study suggested that susceptibility to TB is associated with transcriptional and epigenetic alternations of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. The genes in the HLA family (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1) and IFN pathway (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3) may play major roles in susceptibility to TB.",

    "abstract": "This article reports a case of neonatal incontinentia pigmenti onset in only one male monozygotic twin with characteristic skin lesions after birth followed by severe cerebrovascular lesions.\nA male infant, the first of monozygotic twins, was born with multiple yellow pustules all over his body, repeated new herpes at different sites during the course of the disease, aggravated by fusion, warty crusts, and hyperpigmentation; biopsy pathology suggested eosinophilic spongiform edema of the skin. Peripheral blood eosinophils were significantly elevated, and brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse multiple cystic and lamellar abnormal signal areas in the left frontal and parietal lobes. On day 30, the infant showed neurological symptoms, such as poor response and apnea, and an emergency cranial computed tomography scan revealed abnormal changes in the left cerebral hemisphere and bilateral cerebellum. After admission, he was given a potassium permanganate bath and topical mupirocin for 1 month, and the skin abnormalities improved. He was treated with mechanical ventilation and vasoactive drugs for 2 days after the cerebrovascular accident, and died the same day after the parents chose hospice care. No deletion variants or point mutations were detected in subsequent genetic tests, and chromosomal copy number variation tests revealed different degrees of chimeric duplications and deletions in different regions of chromosomes Y and 3. The parents were healthy, and his twin brother had normal growth and development with no abnormalities at multiple follow-up visits.\nNeonatal incontinentia pigmenti in only one male monozygotic twin is extremely rare and the genetic diagnosis is challenging. Awareness of the combined cerebrovascular lesions needs to be enhanced, and potential prevention and treatment methods need to be explored to improve the prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins represent a promising technology within the domain of precision healthcare, offering significant prospects for individualized medical interventions. Existing systematic reviews, however, mainly focus on the technological dimensions of digital twins, with a limited exploration of their impact on health-related outcomes. Therefore, this systematic review aims to explore the efficacy of digital twins in improving precision healthcare at the population level. The literature search for this study encompassed PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, SinoMed, CNKI, and Wanfang Database to retrieve potentially relevant records. Patient health-related outcomes were synthesized employing quantitative content analysis, whereas the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scales were used to evaluate the quality and potential bias inherent in each selected study. Following established inclusion and exclusion criteria, 12 studies were screened from an initial 1321 records for further analysis. These studies included patients with various conditions, including cancers, type 2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, heart failure, qi deficiency, post-hepatectomy liver failure, and dental issues. The review coded three types of interventions: personalized health management, precision individual therapy effects, and predicting individual risk, leading to a total of 45 outcomes being measured. The collective effectiveness of these outcomes at the population level was calculated at 80% (36 out of 45). No studies exhibited unacceptable differences in quality. Overall, employing digital twins in precision health demonstrates practical advantages, warranting its expanded use to facilitate the transition from the development phase to broad application.PROSPERO registry: CRD42024507256.",

    "abstract": "The human umbilical cord (hUC) is the lifeline that connects the fetus to the mother. Hypercoiling of the hUC is associated with pre- and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We investigated the origin of hUC hypercoiling using state-of-the-art imaging and omics approaches. Macroscopic inspection of the hUC revealed the helices to originate from the arteries rather than other components of the hUC. Digital reconstruction of the hUC arteries showed the dynamic alignment of two layers of muscle fibers in the tunica media aligning in opposing directions. We observed that genetically identical twins can be discordant for hUC coiling, excluding genetic, many environmental, and parental origins of hUC coiling. Comparing the transcriptomic and DNA methylation profile of the hUC arteries of four twin pairs with discordant cord coiling, we detected 28 differentially expressed genes, but no differentially methylated CpGs. These genes play a role in vascular development, cell-cell interaction, and axis formation and may account for the increased number of hUC helices. When combined, our results provide a novel framework to understand the origin of hUC helices in fetal development.",

    "abstract": "The vision of personalized medicine is to identify interventions that maintain or restore a person's health based on their individual biology. Medical digital twins, computational models that integrate a wide range of health-related data about a person and can be dynamically updated, are a key technology that can help guide medical decisions. Such medical digital twin models can be high-dimensional, multi-scale, and stochastic. To be practical for healthcare applications, they often need to be simplified into low-dimensional surrogate models that can be used for optimal design of interventions. This paper introduces surrogate modeling algorithms for the purpose of optimal control applications. As a use case, we focus on agent-based models (ABMs), a common model type in biomedicine for which there are no readily available optimal control algorithms. By deriving surrogate models that are based on systems of ordinary differential equations, we show how optimal control methods can be employed to compute effective interventions, which can then be lifted back to a given ABM. The relevance of the methods introduced here extends beyond medical digital twins to other complex dynamical systems.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to investigate the association between the presence of placental anastomoses and intertwin differences in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activation in monochorionic twins using amniotic fluid aldosterone (AF-ALD) levels. In addition, this study also examined the association between AF-ALD and the ALD levels in the umbilical cord blood (UCB-ALD) in monochorionic twins.\nThis prospective study included monochorionic diamniotic (MD) twin pregnancies that were not complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) at delivery. Amniotic fluid and umbilical cord vein blood samples were collected from each twin at delivery, and the ALD levels were measured subsequently. The MD twins were divided into two groups: those with placental anastomoses and those without anastomoses owing to fetoscopic laser surgery. The differences in the AF-ALD levels between the larger and smaller twins were analyzed.\nThe AF-ALD levels showed a strong and significant positive correlation with UCB-ALD levels in 131 MD twins (r\u2009=\u20090.804, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Intertwin differences were examined in 41 and 28 pairs of MD twins with and without placental anastomoses, respectively. The AF-ALD levels in the smaller twins were significantly higher than those in the larger twins among the pairs of MD twins with placental anastomoses (p\u2009=\u20090.003); however, no statistically significant intertwin differences were observed among the twins without placental anastomoses (p\u2009>\u20090.05).\nThe AF-ALD levels reflect the UCB-ALD levels in MD twins. The presence of placental anastomoses led to intertwin discordance in the ALD levels in MD twins even uncomplicated with TTTS. It was considered that monochorionic twins have this clinical background, and it leads to the development of TTTS.",

    "abstract": "Low birthweight may have adverse sequelae in later life. Therefore, we analyzed behavioral difficulties and salivary glucocorticoid profiles in monozygotic twins with intra-twin birthweight differences due to twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS).\n46 monozygotic TTTS twin pairs with birthweight differences of <1SDS (concordant; n=29) and \u22651SDS (discordant; n=17) were recruited at a mean age of 6.9 years for a prospective longitudinal cohort study. For glucocorticoid analysis, saliva samples were collected (at 7\u202fh, 13\u202fh, 18\u202fh and 21\u202fh) and analyzed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.\nFrom the parents' perspective, the formerly smaller twins had statistically higher scores regarding hyperactivity (mean 4.63 vs 3.48, p=0.003) and emotional problems (mean 2.67 vs 2.02, p=0.042). Less catch-up growth (\u0394intra-twin height SDS 4 years of age - \u0394intra-twin birth length SDS) of the smaller twins was associated with higher scores for hyperactivity (Adj. R\u00b2=0.261, p<0.001, \u03b2=-1.88, F(1.44)=16.86, n=46, f\u00b2=0.35), while smaller birthweight (Adj. R\u00b2=0.135, p=0.007, \u03b2=-0,87, F(1.44)=8.03, n=46, f\u00b2=0.16) and birth length (Adj. R\u00b2=0.085, p=0.028, \u03b2=-0,78, F(1.44)=5.19, n=46, f\u00b2=0.09) were associated with higher scores for peer problems. Greater \u0394intra-twin for cortisol (7\u202fh: rho=0.337, p=0.029; cumulative: rho=0.458; p=0.024) and cortisone (7\u202fh: rho=0.329, p=0.029; 13\u202fh: rho=0.436, p=0.005) correlated with a greater \u0394intra-twin for conduct problems. In the discordant group, circa 1 SDS in head circumference persisted from birth (mean SDS: smaller twin -1.18, larger twin -0.08, p<0.001) to present (mean SDS: smaller twin -1.16, larger twin -0.14, p<0.001).\nHigher cortisol and cortisone concentrations in smaller twins were associated with higher scores for conduct problems. Lower birthweight and absent catch-up growth affected the parents' perspective on the smaller twins' behavior. They saw those children as more hyperactive, with more peer problems and emotional problems. Thus, it seems important to introduce regular check-ups where behavioral difficulties can be assessed, and assistance and advice can be given to the families. Due to the persisting smaller head circumference in the smaller discordant twins, this should be measured regularly.",

    "abstract": "We report on genetic and environmental modulation of social cognition abilities and brain volume correlates in two monozygotic twins (Twin1 and Twin2) with genetically confirmed myotonic dystrophy-type1 who grew up in different environmental settings. They both underwent neuropsychological assessment (i.e., Intelligent Quotient [IQ], theory of mind, emotion recognition tests), and MRI scanning to evaluate regional brain volumetrics compared to 10 gender and sex-matched healthy controls. Against a normal IQ level in both patients, Twin1 was more impaired in emotional processing and Twin2 in cognitive aspects of social cognition. Both patients showed grey matter (GM) atrophy in Brodmann Areas 23/31 (BA23/31) and BA7 bilaterally, while Twin2 showed additional GM loss in right BA46. Both patients showed a similar pattern of white matter atrophy involving the thalamus, basal ganglia, and uncinate fasciculus. White matter atrophy appeared to be mostly driven by genetics, while grey matter volumes appeared associated with different impairments in social cognition and possibly modulated by environment.",

    "abstract": "Conducting clinical trials is becoming increasingly challenging lately due to spiraling costs, increased time to market, and high failure rates. Patient recruitment and retention is one of the key challenges that impact 90% of the trials directly. While a lot of attention has been given to optimizing patient recruitment, limited progress has been made towards developing comprehensive clinical trial monitoring systems to determine patients at risk and potentially improve patient retention through the right intervention at the right time. Earlier research in patient retention primarily focused on using deterministic frameworks to model the inherently stochastic patient journey process. Existing generative approaches to model temporal data such as TimeGAN or CRBM , face challenges and fail to address key requirements such as personalized generation, variable patient journey, and multi-variate time-series needed to model patient digital twin. In response to these challenges, current research proposes ClinicalGAN to enable patient level generation, effectively creating a patient's digital twin. ClinicalGAN provides capabilities for: (a) patient-level personalized generation by utilizing patient meta-data for conditional generation; (b) dynamic termination prediction to enable pro-active patient monitoring for improved patient retention; (c) multi-variate time-series training to incorporate relationship and dependencies among different tests measures captured during patient journey. The proposed solution is validated on two Alzheimer's clinical trial datasets and the results are benchmarked across multiple dimensions of generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed ClinicalGAN outperforms the SOTA approach by 3-4 ",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancy is associated with a high risk of mortality and morbidity. It is necessary to estimate the weight difference of the fetuses with a reliable method to prevent possible complications. This study was conducted to compare the association between the Estimated fetal weight (EFW) discord-ance and the Abdominal Circumference (AC) discordance with birth weight in twins.\nThis was a descriptive-analytical and retrospective study. The statistical population was all twin pregnant mothers referred to Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ahvaz from 2017 to 2019. The sample size was determined with a census (540 people). Based on AC , the size of head circumference (HC), femur length (FL), and the Biparietal Diameter (BPD), EFW was calculated. Then the EFW Dis-cordance and AC Discordance were calculated and compared with the birth weight. Data were analyzed using SPSS18. Unpaired, Two-Tailed T-test and Pearson correlation test were used.\nThe results showed that the mean discordance of fetal weight in twin pregnancies in the EFW method was 9.25%, in the AC method was 9.89% and finally, at birth, was 10.72%. The correla-tion of the weight difference between the two embryos in the AC method with the time of birth (r = 0.922 and \nTherefore, to evaluate the weight and weight difference in twin embryos, the AC method has the appropriate accuracy and compatibility. Another major prospective study to evaluate the diagnostic performance of AC and EFW mismatch based on gestational age at scan, incision point, and maternal and placental characteristics to determine true ultrasound diagnostic accuracy in predict-ing growth mismatch in twin pregnancy and optimal post-case management option is needed.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces an innovative framework for neurological rehabilitation by integrating brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and virtual reality (VR) technologies with the customization of three-dimensional (3D) avatars. Traditional approaches to rehabilitation often fail to fully engage patients, primarily due to their inability to provide a deeply immersive and interactive experience. This research endeavors to fill this gap by utilizing motor imagery (MI) techniques, where participants visualize physical movements without actual execution. This method capitalizes on the brain's neural mechanisms, activating areas involved in movement execution when imagining movements, thereby facilitating the recovery process. The integration of VR's immersive capabilities with the precision of electroencephalography (EEG) to capture and interpret brain activity associated with imagined movements forms the core of this system. Digital Twins in the form of personalized 3D avatars are employed to significantly enhance the sense of immersion within the virtual environment. This heightened sense of embodiment is crucial for effective rehabilitation, aiming to bolster the connection between the patient and their virtual counterpart. By doing so, the system not only aims to improve motor imagery performance but also seeks to provide a more engaging and efficacious rehabilitation experience. Through the real-time application of BCI, the system allows for the direct translation of imagined movements into virtual actions performed by the 3D avatar, offering immediate feedback to the user. This feedback loop is essential for reinforcing the neural pathways involved in motor control and recovery. The ultimate goal of the developed system is to significantly enhance the effectiveness of motor imagery exercises by making them more interactive and responsive to the user's cognitive processes, thereby paving a new path in the field of neurological rehabilitation.",

Prostate SBRT has emerged as a leading option for external beam radiotherapy due to its effectiveness and reduced treatment duration. However, interfractional anatomy variations can impact treatment outcomes. This study seeks to address these uncertainties using DT concept, with the goal of improving treatment quality, potentially revolutionizing prostate radiotherapy to offer personalized treatment solutions. Our study presented a pioneering approach that leverages DT technology to enhance adaptive proton SBRT. The framework improves treatment plans by utilizing patient-specific CTV setup uncertainty, which is usually smaller than conventional clinical setups.

    "abstract": "Do perinatal outcomes of selective termination performed in the late second versus third trimester differ and what risk factors are associated with subsequent preterm birth?\nThis is a retrospective cohort study of late selective terminations performed in dichorionic twins between 2009 and 2021. Perinatal outcomes were compared between two groups: group A, late second trimester (20.2 to 24.2 weeks, n\u202f=\u202f26), and group B, third trimester (\u226528.2 weeks, n\u202f=\u202f55) selective terminations. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with post-procedure preterm birth.\nIn total, 81 dichorionic twin pregnancies were included. There were no pregnancy losses but 16% (13/81) of cases experienced complications. Group A had a higher median birthweight centile (36.5th versus 15th centile, P\u202f=\u202f0.002) and lower rates of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and Caesarean delivery (11.5% versus 32.7%, P\u202f=\u202f0.04; and 26.9% versus 61.8%, P\u202f=\u202f0.003) than group B. Preterm birth rates were similar (46.2% versus 63.6%, P\u202f=\u202f0.15). Multiple regression revealed that reduction of the presenting twin and cervical length \u226435 mm were independently associated with post-procedure preterm birth (odds ratio [OR] 8.7, P\u202f=\u202f0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.5-29.8; OR 3.8, P\u202f=\u202f0.015, 95% CI 1.3-11).\nLate second trimester selective termination is associated with a higher birthweight centile and lower rates of IUGR and Caesarean delivery, compared with third trimester selective termination. Cervical length 35 mm or less and reduction of the presenting twin are independent risk factors for post-procedural preterm birth. These findings may help determine the optimal time to perform a late selective termination.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins aim to optimize practices implemented in various sectors by bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds. Focusing on open-field agriculture, livestock farming, and forestry and reviewing the current applications in these domains, this paper reveals the multifaceted roles of digital twins. Diverse key aspects are examined, including digital twin integration and maturity level, means of data acquisition, technological capabilities, and commonly used input and output features. Through the prism of four primary research questions, the state of the art of digital twins, the extent of their achieved integration, and an overview of the critical issues and potential advancements are provided in the landscape of the sectors under consideration. The paper concludes that in spite of the remarkable progress, there is a long way towards achieving full digital twin. Challenges still persist, while the key factor seems to be the integration of expert knowledge from different stakeholders. In light of the constraints identified in the review analysis, a new sector-specific definition for digital twins is also suggested to align with the distinctive characteristics of intricate biotic and abiotic systems. This research is anticipated to serve as a useful reference for stakeholders, enhancing awareness of the considerable benefits associated with digital twins and promoting a more systematic and comprehensive exploration of this transformative topic.",

    "abstract": "Enteroviruses (EVs) are the most common causes of viral myocarditis in neonates. Neonatal enterovirus myocarditis manifestations range from nonspecific febrile illness to congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock with high risk of in-hospital mortality and long-term cardiac sequelae. Early recognition is essential to undertake appropriate therapy and predict outcomes. Echocardiography and echo-derived left ventricular strain measures seem promising for these purposes. We herein report two cases of neonatal enterovirus-associated myocarditis in dichorionic diamniotic twins, with different presentation, clinical course, and intensity of treatments.",

    "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in preterm neonates, yet its pathophysiology remains unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate risk factors for NEC using an identical twin model. In this case-control study, all monochorionic twin pairs born in our center in 2002-2020 were retrospectively reviewed for NEC. Potential risk factors for NEC were studied. For within-pair comparison, outcomes were compared between affected and unaffected twins. Within-pair analyses showed that the twin with NEC had a lower birth weight compared to its unaffected co-twin (1100 (913-1364) vs. 1339 (1093-1755) grams). Median gestational age at birth and birth weight were lower in twin pairs in the NEC-group compared to the no-NEC group, 29.1\u00a0weeks (27.8-30.8) versus 33.6 (30.7-36.0) and 1221\u00a0g (1010-1488) versus 1865 (1356-2355) respectively. Twin pregnancies in the NEC-group were more often complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome compared to the no-NEC-group (70\u00a0% (14/20) vs. 49\u00a0% (472/962)), particularly when treated with amnioreduction. This unique population of identical twins confirms that preterm neonates with a relatively lower birth weight are more prone to develop NEC compared to their co-twin, regardless of other genetic, maternal and obstetrical factors.",

    "abstract": "While most dizygotic twins have a dichorionic placenta, rare cases of dizygotic twins with a monochorionic placenta have been reported. The monochorionic placenta in dizygotic twins allows in utero exchange of embryonic cells, resulting in chimerism in the twins. In practice, this chimerism is incidentally identified in mixed ABO blood types or in the presence of cells with a discordant sex chromosome. Here, we applied whole-genome sequencing to one triplet and one twin family to precisely understand their zygotic compositions, using millions of genomic variants as barcodes of zygotic origins. Peripheral blood showed asymmetrical contributions from two sister zygotes, where one of the zygotes was the major clone in both twins. Single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood tissues further showed differential contributions from the two sister zygotes across blood cell types. In contrast, buccal tissues were pure in genetic composition, suggesting that in utero cellular exchanges were confined to the blood tissues. Our study illustrates the cellular history of twinning during human development, which is critical for managing the health of chimeric individuals in the era of genomic medicine.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection (TAAD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) are serious autosomal-dominant diseases affecting the cardiovascular system. They are mainly caused by variants in the MYH11 gene, which encodes the heavy chain of myosin 11. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genotype-phenotype correlation of MYH11 from a distinctive perspective based on a pair of monozygotic twins.\nThe detailed phenotypic characteristics of the monozygotic twins from the early fetal stage to the infancy stage were traced and compared with each other and with those of previously documented cases. Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing techniques were used to identify and validate the candidate variants, facilitating the analysis of the genotype-phenotype correlation of MYH11.\nThe monozygotic twins were premature and presented with PDA, pulmonary hypoplasia, and pulmonary hypertension. The proband developed heart and brain abnormalities during the fetal stage and died at 18 days after birth, whereas his sibling was discharged after being cured and developed normally post follow-up. A novel variant c.766\u00a0A\u2009>\u2009G p. (Ile256Val) in MYH11 (NM_002474.2) was identified in the monozygotic twins and classified as a likely pathogenic variant according to the American College of Medical Genetics/Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines. Reviewing the reported cases (n\u2009=\u2009102) showed that the penetrance of MYH11 was 82.35%, and the most common feature was TAAD (41.18%), followed by PDA (22.55%), compound TAAD and PDA (9.80%), and other vascular abnormalities (8.82%). The constituent ratios of null variants among the cases with TAAD (8.60%), PDA (43.8%), or compound TAAD and PDA (28.6%) were significantly different (P\u2009=\u20090.01). Further pairwise comparison of the ratios among these groups showed that there were significant differences between the TAAD and PDA groups (P\u2009=\u20090.006).\nThis study expands the mutational spectrum of MYH11 and provides new insights into the genotype-phenotype correlation of MYH11 based on the monozygotic twins with variable clinical features and outcomes, indicating that cryptic modifiers and complex mechanisms beside the genetic variants may be involved in the condition.",

    "abstract": "Central obesity poses significant health risks because it increases susceptibility to multiple chronic diseases. Epigenetic features such as DNA methylation may be associated with specific obesity traits, which could help us understand how genetic and environmental factors interact to influence the development of obesity. This study aims to identify DNA methylation sites associated with the waist circumference (WC) in Northern Han Chinese population, and to elucidate potential causal relationships.\nA total of 59 pairs of WC discordant monozygotic twins (\u0394WC >0) were selected from the Qingdao Twin Registry in China. Generalized estimated equation model was employed to estimate the methylation levels of CpG sites on WC. Causal relationships between methylation and WC were assessed through the examination of family confounding factors using FAmiliaL CONfounding (ICE FALCON). Additionally, the findings of the epigenome-wide analysis were corroborated in the validation stage.\nWe identified 26 CpG sites with differential methylation reached false discovery rate (FDR)\u2009<\u20090.05 and 22 differentially methylated regions (slk-corrected p\u2009<\u20090.05) strongly linked to WC. These findings provided annotations for 26 genes, with notable emphasis on MMP17, ITGA11, COL23A1, TFPI, A2ML1-AS1, MRGPRE, C2orf82, and NINJ2. ICE FALCON analysis indicated the DNA methylation of ITGA11 and TFPI had a causal effect on WC and vice versa (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Subsequent validation analysis successfully replicated 10 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) out of the 26 identified sites.\nOur research has ascertained an association between specific epigenetic variations and WC in the Northern Han Chinese population. These DNA methylation features can offer fresh insights into the epigenetic regulation of obesity and WC as well as hints to plausible biological mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twins (MC) have higher risk of\u00a0perinatal morbi-mortality compared to singletons and dichorionic twins (DC). Selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) increases the chances of adverse outcome. Hepatic arterial buffer response (HABR) is an important mechanism for maintaining liver perfusion. We hypothesised that HABR is active in monochorionic diamniotic twins (MCDA) with sFGR where restricted fetus may have liver hypoperfusion. The objective of this study is to test whether the HAV-ratio is diminished in pregnancies affected by selective fetal growth restriction pointing to activation of HABR in the growth-restricted fetus.\nsFGR was defined according to a consensus definition. Hepatic artery (HA) peak systolic velocity (PSV) was measured and its correlation with fetal Dopplers and pregnancy characteristics were determined. A ratio using HA-PSV (HAV-ratio) was calculated and its association with sFGR was established. Further analysis of HA-PSV was performed comparing z-scores between normal and growth restricted fetuses.\nWe included 202 MCDA pregnancies, 160 (79\u202f%) normal and 42 (21\u202f%) with sFGR. HAV-ratio was significant different between groups. The mean HAV-ratio was 1.01 (\u00b10.20) for normal twins and 0.77 (\u00b10.25) for sFGR. Furthermore, HA-PSV z-scores was significant increased in in growth-restricted fetus (0.94\u00b11.45), while in normal fetuses was\u00a0-0.16 (\u00b10.97).\nOur findings demonstrate that, in pregnancies with sFGR, HAV-ratio is significantly lower than in normal MCDA pregnancies. The lower HAV-ratio is due to an increase in HA PSV in the growth restricted fetus. This observation indicates an activation of HABR in the small fetus.",

    "abstract": "Rare studies have reported pilomatricoma in twins, and extremely rare cases showed lesions in the same part of the body position. We reported a case of monozygotic twins with pilomatricoma in the same location on the skin of the right upper extremity.\nSeven-year-old monozygotic twins presented to our department with a palpable, painless, and solid mass in the subcutaneous tissue of the right upper limb. A 1.5-cm diameter nodule was seen on the anterolateral aspect of the right upper extremity of the twins. The node was irregular in shape, and upon palpation, the patients reported no noticeable tenderness. Following the administration of local anesthesia, the twins underwent surgical procedure to excise the solid mass. Finally, they were diagnosed with pilomatricoma based on the clinical and histopathological features. Complete surgical resection followed by primary closure was performed. During a follow-up period of three years, there has been no recurrence observed in the twins.\nWe reported a case of monozygotic twins with pilomatricoma in the same location on the skin of the right upper arm. Our findings underscore the requirement of considering genetic factors in the diagnosis and treatment of the rare conditions.",

Despite effective treatment for syphilis in the third trimester, her medical history complicated the situation. The twins, thoraco-omphalopagus conjoined, share vital organs and exhibit congenital anomalies, posing unique diagnostic and management challenges. This case contributes to the scarce literature on conjoined twins, especially in the Dominican Republic. It highlights the complexities of diagnosis, prognosis, and management strategies for such rare cases. This emphasizes the importance of ongoing research and medical intervention in addressing these challenges.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment may be caused by pathophysiological changes occurring decades prior to symptom development. It has been hypothesised that oestrogen can prevent such changes. We aimed to investigate the association between postmenopausal hormone therapy and cognition in Danish female twins and to examine differences in this association before and after publication of the findings from the Women's Health Initiative study in 2002.\nThis study includes cognitive assessment of 4510 twins aged 50+\u00a0years. Information on hormone therapy was obtained through Danish health registries. The association between current hormone therapy use and cognition was analysed in twins aged 50+\u00a0using both cross-sectional, intrapair and longitudinal analysis, adjusting for age, education, social class, and unobserved familial confounding.\nCross-sectionally, systemic HT users aged 70+\u00a0had a significantly lower cognitive function than non-users, whereas systemic HT users aged 50-69 did not differ from non-users before 2002. Longitudinal data in younger twins aged 50-69 showed a significantly lower cognitive function in systemic HT users after 2002 compared to non-users. Systemic HT users aged 70+\u00a0showed that the lower cognitive function was most explicit before 2002, whereas after 2002 the cognitive function was closer to non-users. Twins aged 50-69 who changed from systemic HT to local HT after 2002, or dropped it altogether, performed cognitively better.\nOur findings cautiously indicate a change in the association between cognition and hormone therapy use after 2002, which suggests an alteration in the hormone therapy user profile in the wake of the 2002 WHI publication.",

    "abstract": "Individual sensitivity to environmental exposures may be genetically influenced. This genotype-by-environment interplay implies differences in phenotypic variance across genotypes. However, environmental sensitivity genetic variants have proven challenging to detect. GWAS of monozygotic twin differences is a family-based variance analysis method, which is more robust to systemic biases that impact population-based methods. We combined data from up to 21,792 monozygotic twins (10,896 pairs) from 11 studies to conduct the largest GWAS meta-analysis of monozygotic phenotypic differences in children and adolescents/adults for seven psychiatric and neurodevelopmental phenotypes: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, autistic traits, anxiety and depression symptoms, psychotic-like experiences, neuroticism, and wellbeing. The SNP-heritability of variance in these phenotypes were estimated (h2: 0% to 18%), but were imprecise. We identified a total of 13 genome-wide significant associations (SNP, gene, and gene-set), including genes related to stress-reactivity for depression, growth factor-related genes for autistic traits and catecholamine uptake-related genes for psychotic-like experiences. Monozygotic twins are an important new source of evidence about the genetics of environmental sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Learning disabilities affect a significant proportion of children worldwide, with far-reaching consequences for their academic, professional, and personal lives. Here we develop digital twins - biologically plausible personalized Deep Neural Networks (pDNNs) - to investigate the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying learning disabilities in children. Our pDNN reproduces behavioral and neural activity patterns observed in affected children, including lower performance accuracy, slower learning rates, neural hyper-excitability, and reduced neural differentiation of numerical problems. Crucially, pDNN models reveal aberrancies in the geometry of manifold structure, providing a comprehensive view of how neural excitability influences both learning performance and the internal structure of neural representations. Our findings not only advance knowledge of the neurophysiological underpinnings of learning differences but also open avenues for targeted, personalized strategies designed to bridge cognitive gaps in affected children. This work reveals the power of digital twins integrating AI and neuroscience to uncover mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Digital twin technology is emerging as a transformative paradigm for personalized medicine in the management of chronic conditions. In this article, we explore the concept and key characteristics of a digital twin and its applications in chronic non-communicable metabolic disease management, with a focus on diabetes case studies. We cover various types of digital twin models, including mechanistic models based on ODEs, data-driven ML algorithms, and hybrid modeling strategies that combine the strengths of both approaches. We present successful case studies demonstrating the potential of digital twins in improving glucose outcomes for individuals with T1D and T2D, and discuss the benefits and challenges of translating digital twin research applications to clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The potential impact of large-scale combat operations and multidomain operations against peer adversaries poses significant challenges to the Military Health System including large volumes of critically ill and injured casualties, prolonged care times in austere care contexts, limited movement, contested logistics, and denied communications. These challenges contribute to the probability of higher casualty mortality and risk that casualty care hinders commanders' forward momentum or opportunities for overmatch on the battlefield. Novel technical solutions and associated concepts of operation that fundamentally change the delivery of casualty care are necessary to achieve desired medical outcomes that include maximizing Warfighter battle-readiness, minimizing return-to-duty time, optimizing medical evacuation that clears casualties from the battlefield while minimizing casualty morbidity and mortality, and minimizing resource consumption across the care continuum. These novel solutions promise to \"automate\" certain aspects of casualty care at the level of the individual caregiver and the system level, to unburden our limited number of providers to do more and make better (data-driven) decisions. In this commentary, we describe concepts of casualty digital twins-virtual representations of a casualty's physical journey through the roles of care-and how they, combined with passive data collection about casualty status, caregiver actions, and real-time resource use, can lead to human-machine teaming and increasing automation of casualty care across the care continuum while maintaining or improving outcomes. Our path to combat casualty care automation starts with mapping and modeling the context of casualty care in realistic environments through passive data collection of large amounts of unstructured data to inform machine learning models. These context-aware models will be matched with patient physiology models to create casualty digital twins that better predict casualty needs and resources required and ultimately inform and accelerate decision-making across the continuum of care. We will draw from the experience of the automotive industry as an exemplar for achieving automation in health care and inculcate automation as a mechanism for optimizing the casualty care survival chain.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins have emerged as a groundbreaking concept in personalized medicine, offering immense potential to transform health care delivery and improve patient outcomes. It is important to highlight the impact of digital twins on personalized medicine across the understanding of patient health, risk assessment, clinical trials and drug development, and patient monitoring. By mirroring individual health profiles, digital twins offer unparalleled insights into patient-specific conditions, enabling more accurate risk assessments and tailored interventions. However, their application extends beyond clinical benefits, prompting significant ethical debates over data privacy, consent, and potential biases in health care. The rapid evolution of this technology necessitates a careful balancing act between innovation and ethical responsibility. As the field of personalized medicine continues to evolve, digital twins hold tremendous promise in transforming health care delivery and revolutionizing patient care. While challenges exist, the continued development and integration of digital twins hold the potential to revolutionize personalized medicine, ushering in an era of tailored treatments and improved patient well-being. Digital twins can assist in recognizing trends and indicators that might signal the presence of diseases or forecast the likelihood of developing specific medical conditions, along with the progression of such diseases. Nevertheless, the use of human digital twins gives rise to ethical dilemmas related to informed consent, data ownership, and the potential for discrimination based on health profiles. There is a critical need for robust guidelines and regulations to navigate these challenges, ensuring that the pursuit of advanced health care solutions does not compromise patient rights and well-being. This viewpoint aims to ignite a comprehensive dialogue on the responsible integration of digital twins in medicine, advocating for a future where technology serves as a cornerstone for personalized, ethical, and effective patient care.",

    "abstract": "An overview of circumstances in which twins take the place of their co-twin is presented. Various explanations and speculations are proposed for understanding twins' willingness to do so in certain situations. This section is followed by reviews of timely twin research, namely single versus multiple embryo transfer; neurimaging of twins with periventricular nodular heterotopia; a twin dietary comparison; and a new book of twin-related readings from Hungary. The final portion of this article concerns human interest stories that both inform and entertain. They involve valedictorian and salutatorian twins; a mother delivering twins at age seventy; twins reunited by TikTok; a new film about twins with selective mutism; and twins becoming doctors.",

    "abstract": "Trisomy 20p is a rare genetic condition caused by a duplication of the short arm of chromosome 20.\nWe employed clinical observation and molecular genetic testing (SNP microarray), to study identical twin males with an unknown dysmorphic syndrome. We conducted a literature review of trisomy 20p and collated the clinical and molecular genetic findings on 20 affected subjects reported since 2000.\nIdentical twin males, whose prenatal course was complicated by a twin-to-twin transfusion, manifested profound language and neurocognitive delays as well as distinctive facial dysmorphisms when evaluated at 2\u2009years of age. SNP microarray identified identical duplications of 20p13 with no other chromosomal aberrations. A literature survey of 20p trisomy syndrome identified 20 other examples of this condition reported since 2000, which we collated with 33 summarized by Sidwell et\u00a0al. (2000). Within the combined total of 55 affected individuals, we found a distinctive clinical phenotype that provides insight on the effects of abnormal dosage of genes in 20p13. These loci include FAM110A (OMIM 611393), ANGPT4 (OMIM 603705), RSPO4 (OMIM 610573), PSMF1 (OMIM 617858), SNPH (OMIM 604942), SDCBP2 (OMIM 617358), FKBP1A (OMIM 186945), TMEM74B, C20orf202, and RAD21L1 (OMIM 619533). Gene profiling highlighted that syntaphilin (SNPH) is highly expressed in mammalian brain, where it is considered critical for mitochondrial transport in neuronal axons, and to directly influence axonal morphogenesis and function.\nWe propose that abnormal activity of syntaphilin engendered by the trisomy is primarily responsible for the language, neurocognitive, and gross motor delays reported in individuals with 20p trisomy. Additional studies, for example, characterization of cerebral organoids generated from affected patients may help to better understand this condition, and potentially suggest rational remedies to improve the lives of affected individuals and their families.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular abnormalities are increasingly recognised among people newly diagnosed with HIV, but subclinical pathology may be challenging to diagnose. We present a case study of subtle cardiovascular changes in identical twins, one without HIV-infection and the other recently diagnosed with HIV (serodiscordant). We hypothesise that cardiovascular parameters would be similar between the twins, unless non-genetic (environmental) factors are at play. These differences likely represent occult pathology secondary to the effects of early HIV-infection. A 25-year-old female incidentally diagnosed with HIV, and her HIV-uninfected identical twin, living with her since birth, underwent comprehensive cardiovascular assessments. The HIV-positive twin exhibited a globular left ventricle (LV), larger LV volumes, decreased LV strain, peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS) and higher native T1 and T2 mapping values compared to her sister. Cardiac biomarkers high sensitivity cardiac troponin T and N-terminal proBNP, as well as the novel markers of fibrosis and remodelling, galectin-3 and soluble-ST2, were higher in the HIV-infected twin. Given the twins' shared environment and genetic makeup, these differences likely stem from HIV-infection. Our study supports previous findings and suggests potential screening markers for HIV-associated cardiovascular disease, including PALS. Further research is warranted to explore PALS' utility in this context.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The rarity of ischiopagus tripus conjoined twins complicates the surgical separation, owing to the lack of cases and high complexity. We aim to report our experience in performing orthopedic correction for ischiopagus tripus twins. CASE REPORT A pair of 3-year-old conjoined boys presented with a fused body at the pelvis region and only 1 umbilicus. There were 2 legs separated by shared genitalia and an anus at the midline, and 1 fused leg, which could be felt and moved by both of the patients. The twins also shared internal organs of the bladder, intestine, and rectum, as visualized through angiography computerized tomography scan. After several team discussions with the institutional review board, the hospital ethics committee, and both parents, it was agreed to perform disarticulation of the fused third limb, followed by correction of the trunk alignment by pelvic closed wedge osteotomy and internal fixation. We successfully reconstructed the pelvis using locking plates and additional 3.5-mm cortical screws and 1.2-mm stainless steel wire. CONCLUSIONS This report describes the presentation and surgical management of a case of ischiopagus tripus conjoined twins. It highlights the challenges involved in surgery and the importance of investigating these infants for other congenital abnormalities. Although surgical approaches for different sets of twins should be individually tailored, interventions aimed to provide optimal outcomes should consider ethical issues and parental/patient expectations. Even in situations in which the twins are inseparable, there is still room for surgical correction to be performed.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the integration of technological advancements and digitalization into healthcare has brought about a remarkable transformation in care delivery and patient management. Among these advancements, the concept of digital twins (DTs) has recently gained attention as a tool with substantial transformative potential in different clinical contexts. DTs are virtual representations of a physical entity (e.g., a patient or an organ) or systems (e.g., hospital wards, including laboratories), continuously updated with real-time data to mirror its real-world counterpart. DTs can be utilized to monitor and customize health care by simulating an individual's health status based on information from wearables, medical devices, diagnostic tests, and electronic health records. In addition, DTs can be used to define personalized treatment plans. In this study, we focused on some possible applications of DTs in laboratory medicine when used with AI and synthetic data obtained by generative AI. The first point discussed how biological variation (BV) application could be tailored to individuals, considering population-derived BV data on laboratory parameters and circadian or ultradian variations. Another application could be enhancing the interpretation of tumor markers in advanced cancer therapy and treatments. Furthermore, DTs applications might derive personalized reference intervals, also considering BV data or they can be used to improve test results interpretation. DT's widespread adoption in healthcare is not imminent, but it is not far off. This technology will likely offer innovative and definitive solutions for dynamically evaluating treatments and more precise diagnoses for personalized medicine.",

The real implementation of graphene-based sensors and electronic devices remains challenging due to the integration complexities of high-quality graphene materials with existing manufacturing processes. To address this, scalable techniques for the in-situ fabrication of graphene-like materials are essential. One promising method involves using a CO",

    "abstract": "Specialized robotic and surgical tools are increasing the complexity of operating rooms (ORs), requiring elaborate preparation especially when techniques or devices are to be used for the first time. Spatial planning can improve efficiency and identify procedural obstacles ahead of time, but real ORs offer little availability to optimize space utilization. Methods for creating reconstructions of physical setups, i.e., digital twins, are needed to enable immersive spatial planning of such complex environments in virtual reality.\nWe present a neural rendering-based method to create immersive digital twins of complex medical environments and devices from casual video capture that enables spatial planning of surgical scenarios. To evaluate our approach we recreate two operating rooms and ten objects through neural reconstruction, then conduct a user study with 21 graduate students carrying out planning tasks in the resulting virtual environment. We analyze task load, presence, perceived utility, plus exploration and interaction behavior compared to low visual complexity versions of the same environments.\nResults show significantly increased perceived utility and presence using the neural reconstruction-based environments, combined with higher perceived workload and exploratory behavior. There's no significant difference in interactivity.\nWe explore the feasibility of using modern reconstruction techniques to create digital twins of complex medical environments and objects. Without requiring expert knowledge or specialized hardware, users can create, explore and interact with objects in virtual environments. Results indicate benefits like high perceived utility while being technically approachable, which may indicate promise of this approach for spatial planning and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Digital Twins have emerged as an outstanding opportunity for precision farming, digitally replicating in real-time the functionalities of objects and plants. A virtual replica of the crop, including key agronomic development aspects such as irrigation, optimal fertilization strategies, and pest management, can support decision-making and a step change in farm management, increasing overall sustainability and direct water, fertilizer, and pesticide savings. In this review, Digital Twin technology is critically reviewed and framed in the context of recent advances in precision agriculture and Agriculture 4.0. The review is organized for each step of agricultural lifecycle, edaphic, phytotechnologic, postharvest, and farm infrastructure, with supporting case studies demonstrating direct benefits for agriculture production and supply chain considering both benefits and limitations of such an approach. Challenges and limitations are disclosed regarding the complexity of managing such an amount of data and a multitude of (often) simultaneous operations and supports.",

    "abstract": "Gene therapy using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) as delivery vehicles has garnered much interest in recent years. There are still significant gaps in our fundamental understanding of the manufacturing processes to deliver sufficient products. Manufacturing efforts of rAAV using HEK293 cells have commonly relied on fixed bed falling film bioreactors like the iCELLis\u00ae. We used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to validate the operating conditions required for a predictive iCELLis\u00ae 500 scale-down model. The small-scale and at-scale systems have different flow paths causing validation of the corresponding agitation rates required to achieve the same linear flow through the fixed bed across scales to be non-trivial. Therefore, we used CFD to predict the theoretical scaling relationship. In addition, CFD could predict kLa differences between the two systems and the operating conditions required to match kLa between scales. We also confirmed that the location of DO control must be the same in both systems to achieve proper scaling. Experimental runs confirming the validity of the novel scale-down model showed that based on the modifications to the iCELLis\u00ae Nano system, we achieved similar DO, key metabolite, pH, and GC titer trends in both systems.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia affects approximately 1% of the world population. Genetics, epigenetics, and environmental factors are known to play a role in this psychiatric disorder. While there is a high concordance in monozygotic twins, about half of twin pairs are discordant for schizophrenia. To address the question of how and when concordance in monozygotic twins occur, we have obtained fibroblasts from two pairs of schizophrenia discordant twins (one sibling with schizophrenia while the second one is unaffected by schizophrenia) and three pairs of healthy twins (both of the siblings are healthy). We have prepared iPSC models for these 3 groups of patients with schizophrenia, unaffected co-twins, and the healthy twins. When the study started the co-twins were considered healthy and unaffected but both the co-twins were later diagnosed with a depressive disorder. The reprogrammed iPSCs were differentiated into hippocampal neurons to measure the neurophysiological abnormalities in the patients. We found that the neurons derived from the schizophrenia patients were less arborized, were hypoexcitable with immature spike features, and exhibited a significant reduction in synaptic activity with dysregulation in synapse-related genes. Interestingly, the neurons derived from the co-twin siblings who did not have schizophrenia formed another distinct group that was different from the neurons in the group of the affected twin siblings but also different from the neurons in the group of the control twins. Importantly, their synaptic activity was not affected. Our measurements that were obtained from schizophrenia patients and their monozygotic twin and compared also to control healthy twins point to hippocampal synaptic deficits as a central mechanism in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Researchers have proposed that culture significantly influences perceived stress (PS). To date, however, twin studies on PS have been conducted mostly in western, individualistic cultures, which demonstrate that PS due to controllable (personal) life events is more heritable than PS due to uncontrollable (network) life events. This study aimed to investigate genetic and environmental influences on PS in South Korean twins. South Korea practices a dominant collectivist culture. In total, 1372 twin individuals (mean age = 22.4 \u00b1 2.5 years) completed an online survey on PS, which consisted of the scales, Friendship, Academic Stress, Future Career, Family Conflicts, and Family Financial Difficulties (FFD). Friendship, Academic Stress, and Future Career can be considered PS due to personal life events, and Family Conflict and FFD, PS due to network life events. The general sex-limitation model-fitting analysis revealed the absence of qualitative or quantitative sex differences in genetic and environmental influences. Specifically, additive genetic influences were predominant for Friendship (63%), Academic Stress (67%), and Future Career (57%) for both sexes, with the remaining variance attributable to nonshared environmental influences. In contrast, shared environmental influences were largest for Family Conflict (47% for both genders) and FFD (64% for males, 63% for females) with no significant genetic effects. Despite known cultural differences in the means and variances of PS, South Korean twins exhibited significant genetic effects in PS due to personal life events and large shared environmental effects in PS due to network life events, which is similar to western samples.",

    "abstract": "Virtual brain twins are personalized, generative and adaptive brain models based on data from an individual's brain for scientific and clinical use. After a description of the key elements of virtual brain twins, we present the standard model for personalized whole-brain network models. The personalization is accomplished using a subject's brain imaging data by three means: (1) assemble cortical and subcortical areas in the subject-specific brain space; (2) directly map connectivity into the brain models, which can be generalized to other parameters; and (3) estimate relevant parameters through model inversion, typically using probabilistic machine learning. We present the use of personalized whole-brain network models in healthy ageing and five clinical diseases: epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and psychiatric disorders. Specifically, we introduce spatial masks for relevant parameters and demonstrate their use based on the physiological and pathophysiological hypotheses. Finally, we pinpoint the key challenges and future directions.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins (CT), which used to be historically defined as \"monstrous human\" and previously so-called Siamese twins in the early eighteenth century, are one of the very rare congenital malformations with an uncertain etiology and complex yet remain inconclusively debatable regarding its pathophysiological mechanisms of fusion and fission theories. Among all types of CT, parasitic CT, especially the pygopagus sub-type, is exceedingly rarer. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no parasitic CT had been reported in Papua, and this is the first finding in South Papua.\nHerein, a 30-year-old multigravida female with 37th-week gestation, previous twice spontaneous miscarriage, and non-adequate antenatal care history is presented with a chief complaint of painful construction and greenish fluid leakage from the vagina, with an examination that showed a cephalic presentation with a \"peculiar\" big mass at the upper uterus and complete cervical dilation toward second-stage inpartu. Vaginal delivery was performed with a complication of obstructed labor due to uncommon dystocia with a suspected \"big mass\" below the fetal buttocks and intrapartum dead. Intrapartum transabdominal ultrasound demonstrates a gross anatomically like an organ inside a fluid-filled mass with unidentified parts, leading to a suspected type of congenital malformation at the baby's sacral region. Emergency C-section was done with findings of parasitic pygopagus CT, showing an attachment of a large irregular fluid-filled mass-like incomplete twin (parasite) with palpable soft tissue and bony structure inside to the buttocks of a male autosite twin, and an additional third leg which happened to be an under-developed lower extremity with a sacrum-like structure.\nAn obstetrician's routine ANC and critical radiological evaluation will increase the odds of identifying CT or other congenital malformations to provide better delivery planning or further management. Increasing maternal health knowledge in society, improving medical skills and knowledge levels for health providers, and advancing supporting facilities and specialists are future strategies for managing and preventing such cases in low-middle-income countries.",

    "abstract": "Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tears are not as frequent as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. They are rare as an isolated injury and more commonly occur in a multi-ligament-injured knee. We reported a case of rupture of PCL in monozygotic twins.\nA 19-year-old female presented with giving away of her left knee since 4\u00a0months ago. She fell from stairs previously. Physical examination demonstrated positive posterior drawer test. Magnetic resonance imaging showed ruptured PCL and lateral meniscal tear. Two months later, her identical twin, also a 19-year old-female, fell from the stairs and complained of giving away. Physical examination showed positive posterior drawer test. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated ruptured PCL and lateral meniscal tear. Both patients underwent arthroscopic-assisted PCL reconstruction using gracilis, semitendinosus, and peroneus tendon graft. At one year of follow-up, there were no graft failures. The twins had satisfactory outcome measured by Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and visual analogue scale (VAS). Both were athletes prior to their injury and they returned to sport.\nAlthough it has never been reported before, this report shows that patients may have genetic predisposition to the incidence of PCL rupture. This is likely because of heritable factors, such as biomechanical, anatomic, anthropometric, and neuromuscular traits. A family history of PCL tear may increase the risk of a PCL tear. Further studies are recommended to examine genetic variants as a risk factor for PCL tears and other knee disorders.\nMultiple variables may lead to the increased risk of these twins: the combination of improper neuromuscular control, genetic factors, and possibly hormonal factors contributed to their PCL injuries. Further history exploration, lab tests, and genetic analysis should be done to determine the variables. Both patients returned to sports protocol testing and returned to sports one year postoperatively.",

    "abstract": "A twin study is a valuable tool for elucidating the acquired factors against lifestyle diseases such as dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. We aimed 1. to investigate the factors that affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in monozygotic (MZ) twins, and 2. to identify genes which expression levels changed in pairs with large differences in LDL-C or HDL-C levels.\nThe registered database at the Center for Twin Research, Osaka University, containing 263 pairs of MZ twins, was analyzed. 1. The effects of smoking, exercise, nutritional factors, and anthropometric and biochemical parameters on LDL-C or HDL-C levels were examined in MZ twins. 2. RNA sequencing in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 59 pairs was analyzed for large differences of LDL-C or HDL-C groups.\n1. The \u0394LDL-C levels were significantly associated with an older age, the \u0394TG levels, and \u0394BMI. \u0394HDL-C levels were associated with the \u0394BMI, \u0394TG, \u0394TP, and \u0394LDL-C levels. The HDL-C levels were affected by smoking and exercise habits. The intakes of cholesterol and saturated fatty acids were not associated with the LDL-C or HDL-C levels. 2. An RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the expression of genes related to the TLR4 and IFNG pathways was suppressed in accordance with the HDL-C levels in the larger \u0394HDL-C group among the 59 pairs.\nWe identified the factors affecting the LDL-C or HDL-C levels in monozygotic twins. In addition, some types of inflammatory gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were suppressed in accordance with the HDL-C levels, thus suggesting the importance of weight management and exercise habits in addition to dietary instructions to control the LDL-C or HDL-C levels.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes management requires constant monitoring and individualized adjustments. This study proposes a novel approach that leverages digital twins and personal health knowledge graphs (PHKGs) to revolutionize diabetes care. Our key contribution lies in developing a real-time, patient-centric digital twin framework built on PHKGs. This framework integrates data from diverse sources, adhering to HL7 standards and enabling seamless information access and exchange while ensuring high levels of accuracy in data representation and health insights. PHKGs offer a flexible and efficient format that supports various applications. As new knowledge about the patient becomes available, the PHKG can be easily extended to incorporate it, enhancing the precision and accuracy of the care provided. This dynamic approach fosters continuous improvement and facilitates the development of new applications. As a proof of concept, we have demonstrated the versatility of our digital twins by applying it to different use cases in diabetes management. These include predicting glucose levels, optimizing insulin dosage, providing personalized lifestyle recommendations, and visualizing health data. By enabling real-time, patient-specific care, this research paves the way for more precise and personalized healthcare interventions, potentially improving long-term diabetes management outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Cancer and cardiovascular disease are the two most common causes of death worldwide. As the fields of cardiovascular medicine and oncology continue to expand, the area of overlap is becoming more prominent demanding dedicated attention and individualized patient care. We have come to realize that both fields are inextricably intertwined in several aspects, so much so that the mere presence of one, with its resultant downstream implications, has an impact on the other. Nonetheless, cardiovascular disease and cancer are generally approached independently. The focus that is granted to the predominant pathological entity (either cardiovascular disease or cancer), does not allow for optimal medical care for the other. As a result, ample opportunities for improvement in overall health care are being overlooked. Herein, we hope to shed light on the interconnected relationship between cardiovascular disease and cancer and uncover some of the unintentionally neglected intricacies of common cardiovascular therapeutics from an oncologic standpoint.",

    "abstract": "Due to population growth, climate change, and the urban heat island effect, heat exposure is becoming an important issue faced by urban built environments. Heat exposure assessment is a prerequisite for mitigation measures to reduce the impact of heat exposure. However, there is limited research on urban heat exposure assessment approaches that provides fine-scale spatiotemporal heat exposure information, integrated with meteorological status and human collective exposure as they move about in cities, to enable proactive heat exposure mitigation measures. Smart city digital twins (SCDTs) provide a new potential avenue for addressing this gap, enabling fine spatiotemporal scales, human-infrastructure interaction modeling, and predictive and decision support capabilities. This study aims to develop and test an SCDT for collective urban heat exposure assessment and forecasting. Meteorological sensors and computer vision techniques\u00a0were implemented in Columbus, Georgia, to acquire temperature, humidity, and passersby count data. These data were then integrated into a collective temperature humidity index. A time-series prediction model and a crowd simulation were employed to predict future short-term heat exposures based on the data accumulated by this SCDT and to support heat exposure mitigation efforts. The results demonstrate the potential of SCDT to enhance public safety by providing city officials with a tool for discovering, predicting, and, ultimately, mitigating community exposure to extreme heat.",

    "abstract": "This study examined brain functional connectivity (FC) changes associated with possible anomalous interactions between sensorily isolated monozygotic (MZ) twins. Brain FC was estimated using the Steady State Visual Evoked Potential-Event Related Partial Coherence (SSVEP-ERPC) methodology. Five twin pairs served twice as participants, with an average interval between sessions of 67\u2009days. In each recording session, one twin, the Sender, viewed a randomized set of 50 general images and 50 personally relevant images, while the other twin, the Receiver, viewed a static personally relevant image for the entire duration of the session. Images appeared on the Sender screen for 1.0\u2009s, with the interval between successive images varied randomly between 4.0 and 8.0\u2009s. Receiver FC changes were calculated based on the appearance times of the images as viewed by the Sender. It was hypothesized that anomalous interactions would be indicated by statistically significant Receiver FC changes when those changes are determined using the Sender image appearance times. For each twin serving as Receiver, FC components were separately analyzed for the 50 general and the 50 personal images, yielding 38 observations (19 twin pairs by 2 conditions). The hypothesis was confirmed in that 11 of the 38 observations yielded statistically significant Receiver FC increases or decreases at the ",

    "abstract": "Handgrip strength is a crucial indicator to monitor the change of cognitive function over time, but its mechanism still needs to be further explored. We sampled 59 monozygotic twin pairs to explore the potential mediating effect of DNA methylation (DNAm) on the association between handgrip strength and cognitive function. The initial step was the implementation of an epigenome-wide association analysis (EWAS) in the study participants, with the aim of identifying DNAm variations that are associated with handgrip strength. Following that, we conducted an assessment of the mediated effect of DNAm by the use of mediation analysis. In order to do an ontology enrichment study for CpGs, the GREAT program was used. There was a significant positive association between handgrip strength and cognitive function (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.194, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The association between handgrip strength and DNAm of 124 CpGs was found to be statistically significant at a significance level of P\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910",

    "abstract": "Preterms are at risk of systemic infections as the barrier function of their immature skin is insufficient. The long period of hospitalization and the huge number of invasive procedures represent a risk factor for complications. Among the nosocomial infections of the skin, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We report a clinical case of cellulitis and abscess in two preterm twins caused by MRSA in a tertiary level Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).\nTwo preterm female babies developed cellulitis from MRSA within the first month of extrauterine life. The first one (BW 990\u00a0g) showed signs of clinical instability 4\u00a0days before the detection of a hyperaemic and painful mass on the thorax. The second one (BW 1240\u00a0g) showed signs of clinical instability contextually to the detection of an erythematous, oedematous and painful area in the right submandibular space. In both cases the diagnosis of cellulitis was confirmed by ultrasound. A broad spectrum, multidrug antimicrobial therapy was administered till complete resolution.\nDue to the characteristic antibiotic resistance of MRSA and the potential complications of those infections in such delicate patients, basic prevention measures still represent the key to avoid the spreading of neonatal MRSA infections in NICUs, which include hand hygiene and strict precautions, as well as screening of patients for MRSA on admission and during hospital stay, routine prophylactic topical antibiotic of patients, enhanced environmental cleaning, cohorting and isolation of positive patients, barrier precautions, avoidance of ward crowding, and, in some units, surveillance, education and decolonization of healthcare workers and visiting parents.",

    "abstract": "Fetal growth restriction (FGR) can negatively affect lung development, leading to increased respiratory morbidity and reduced lung function later in life. Studies regarding the impact of FGR on lung function in singletons are influenced by genetic, obstetric, and maternal factors. To overcome these confounding factors, we aim to investigate lung function in identical twins with selective FGR (sFGR).\nLung function assessments were performed in identical twins with sFGR born in our centre between March 1, 2002, and December 31, 2017, aged between 5 and 17 years. sFGR was defined as birthweight discordance \u226520%. Outcome measures consisted of forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0s (FEV\nThirty-nine twin pairs performed spirometry of sufficient quality. Median gestational age at birth was 34.3 (interquartile range (IQR) 32.1-36.0) weeks with median birthweights of 1500 (IQR 1160-1880) grams and 2178 (IQR 1675-2720) grams for the smaller and larger twin, respectively. Smaller twins had significantly lower z-scores for FEV\nAlthough being genetically identical, sFGR in identical twins is associated with a reduction in static and dynamic lung volume and a reduction in lung diffusion, even when taking the reduced lung volume into account. This indicates that adverse growth conditions in utero negatively affect lung development and function, potentially contributing to an increase in respiratory morbidities later in life.\nThe Dutch Heart Foundation and The Bontius Foundation.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac arrhythmias remain a\u00a0major cause of death and disability. Current antiarrhythmic therapies are effective to only a limited extent, likely in large part due to their mechanism-independent approach. Precision cardiology aims to deliver targeted therapy for an individual patient to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects. In-silico digital twins have emerged as a\u00a0promising strategy to realize the vision of precision cardiology. While there is no uniform definition of a\u00a0digital twin, it typically employs digital tools, including simulations of mechanistic computer models, based on patient-specific clinical data to understand arrhythmia mechanisms and/or make clinically relevant predictions. Digital twins have become part of routine clinical practice in the setting of interventional cardiology, where commercially available services use digital twins to non-invasively determine the severity of stenosis (computed tomography-based fractional flow reserve). Although routine clinical application has not been achieved for cardiac arrhythmia management, significant progress towards digital twins for cardiac electrophysiology has been made in recent years. At the same time, significant technical and clinical challenges remain. This article provides a\u00a0short overview of the history of digital twins for cardiac electrophysiology, including recent applications for the prediction of sudden cardiac death risk and the tailoring of rhythm control in atrial fibrillation. The authors highlight the current challenges for routine clinical application and discuss how overcoming these challenges may allow digital twins to enable a\u00a0significant precision medicine-based advancement in cardiac arrhythmia management.\nHerzrhythmusst\u00f6rungen geh\u00f6ren nach wie vor zu den Hauptursachen f\u00fcr Morbidit\u00e4t und Mortalit\u00e4t. Aktuelle antiarrhythmische Therapien sind nur begrenzt wirksam, zum Teil aufgrund ihrer unspezifischen Wirkmechanismen. Die Pr\u00e4zisionsmedizin zielt darauf ab, f\u00fcr jeden Patienten eine ma\u00dfgeschneiderte Therapie zu entwickeln, welche die Wirksamkeit optimiert und gleichzeitig die Nebenwirkungen minimiert. Eine vielversprechende Strategie, um diese Vision zu verwirklichen, sind digitale Zwillinge. F\u00fcr diesen Begriff gibt es keine einheitliche Definition, gew\u00f6hnlich beinhaltet er aber Simulationen mechanistischer Computermodelle, die auf patientenspezifischen Daten basieren. Mit diesen Tools k\u00f6nnen Arrhythmiemechanismen analysiert und klinisch relevante Vorhersagen getroffen werden. Digitale Zwillinge sind in der interventionellen Kardiologie bereits etabliert, z.\u202fB. in kommerziellen Anwendungen, um den Schweregrad einer Stenose nichtinvasiv zu bestimmen (Computertomographie-gest\u00fctzte fraktionelle Flussreserve). F\u00fcr die Behandlung von Herzrhythmusst\u00f6rungen haben sich bislang noch keine routinem\u00e4\u00dfigen klinischen Anwendungen digitaler Zwillinge etabliert. Jedoch wurden in den letzten Jahren erhebliche Fortschritte in diesem Bereich erzielt. Gro\u00dfe technische und klinische Herausforderungen bleiben aber bestehen. In der vorliegenden \u00dcbersichtsarbeit geben wir einen kurzen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Entwicklung digitaler Zwillinge in der kardialen Elektrophysiologie und stellen aktuelle Anwendungen vor, die das Risiko eines pl\u00f6tzlichen Herztods vorhersagen und eine individuelle Rhythmuskontrolle bei Vorhofflimmern erlauben. Wir erl\u00e4utern die aktuellen Herausforderungen f\u00fcr die klinische Praxis und zeigen, wie digitale Zwillinge durch die \u00dcberwindung dieser Herausforderungen in der Zukunft einen bedeutenden Fortschritt in der pr\u00e4zisionsmedizinischen Behandlung von Herzrhythmusst\u00f6rungen erm\u00f6glichen k\u00f6nnen.",

This study aimed to assess expert feedback on a proposed pragmatic idea for launching a continuous health promotion and prevention programme (HPPP) to establish and maintain twin cohorts.\nA qualitative study incorporating an inductive thematic analysis.\nTehran University of Medical Sciences.\nResearchers with expertise in twin studies participated in our study.\nExpert opinions were gathered through focus group discussions (FGDs). Thematic analysis was employed to analyse the findings and develop a model for designing a comprehensive, long-term health promotion programme using ATLAS.ti software. Additionally, a standardised framework was developed to represent the conceptual model of the twin HPPP.\nEight FGDs were conducted, involving 16 experts. Thematic analysis identified eight themes and seven subthemes that encompassed the critical aspects of a continuous monitoring programme for twin health. Based on these identified themes, a conceptual framework was developed for the implementation of an HPPP tailored for twins.\nThis study presented the initial endeavour to establish a comprehensive and practical solution in the form of a continuous HPPP designed to tackle the obstacles of twins' cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Alstrom syndrome is one of the rarest monogenic ciliopathy belonging to autosomal recessive disorder. The pathophysiology of Alstrom syndrome is not well understood but based upon the available medical literature its mechanism can be linked with recessive mutation in Alstrom syndrome 1(ALSM1) gene resulting in various multiple organ involvement and poor prognosis. Moreover the co-occurrence of such syndrome simultaneously in twins in same period of time is considered rare.\nMonochorionic diamniotic twins male born to healthy parents with significant antenatal and natal history along with decreased vision in both eyes in both twins since neonatal period. Throughout the childhood the disease progressed without any confirmatory diagnosis during which the twins underwent simultaneous multiple systemic involvement such as legal blindness in both twins at the age of 11 years, insulin resistance and features of diabetes mellitus, sensorineural hearing loss, subclinical hypothyroidism and various deranged metabolic panels. Certain diagnosis of Alstrom syndrome was made at the age of 16 years in both twins after whole-exome sequencing.\nBased on genetic profile alstrom syndrome is a unique diagnosis. Along with its multi-organ involvement features, its progression and prognosis should also be looked upon while diagnosis and management in such syndromic patients. The diagnostic delay in such cases is also a matter of concern which can result in further delay in halting adverse effects of the disease itself. The multidisciplinary approach with involvement of endocrionologist, ophthalmologist and audiologist can bring upon improvement in quality of life of the patients.\nWith the prevalence of 1 in million cases Alstrom Hallgren syndrome is one of the rare genetic disorder with poor prognosis. In our case we present classical findings in twins who were diagnosed as Alstrom syndrome concurrently and further diseases progressed simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Previous findings suggest DNA methylation as a potential mechanism in T2D pathogenesis and progression.\nWe profiled DNA methylation in 248 blood samples from participants of European ancestry from 7 twin cohorts using a methylation sequencing platform targeting regulatory genomic regions encompassing 2,048,698 CpG sites.\nWe find and replicate 3 previously unreported T2D differentially methylated CpG positions (T2D-DMPs) at FDR 5% in RGL3, NGB and OTX2, and 20 signals at FDR 25%, of which 14 replicated. Integrating genetic variation and T2D-discordant monozygotic twin analyses, we identify both genetic-based and genetic-independent T2D-DMPs. The signals annotate to genes with established GWAS and EWAS links to T2D and its complications, including blood pressure (RGL3) and eye disease (OTX2).\nThe results help to improve our understanding of T2D disease pathogenesis and progression and may provide biomarkers for its complications.\nFunding acknowledgements for each cohort can be found in the Supplementary Note.",

    "abstract": "There is evidence that older adults with cancer have a higher risk of functional decline than cancer-free older adults. However, few studies are longitudinal, and none are twin studies. Thus, we aimed to investigate the relationship between cancer and functional decline in older adult (aged 70+ years) twins.\nCancer cases in the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins were identified through the Danish Cancer Registry. Functional status was assessed using hand grip strength (6 years follow-up), and self-reported questions on mobility (10 years follow-up), and cut-offs were defined to assess functional decline. Cox regression models were performed for all the individual twins. In addition, we extended the analysis to discordant twin pairs (twin pairs with one having cancer and the other being cancer-free), to control to a certain extent for (unmeasured) shared confounders (genetic and environmental factors).\nThe analysis based on individual twins showed that individual twins with cancer are at increased hazard of worsening hand grip strength (hazard ratio (HR) 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04, 1.80) than cancer-free twins. Among the discordant twin pairs, twins with cancer had a higher hazard of worsening hand grip strength (HR 3.50, 95% CI 1.15, 10.63) than cancer-free cotwins. In contrast, there was no evidence of a difference between the hazard of experiencing mobility decline for twins with cancer compared with cancer-free twins, in both individual twins and discordant twin pairs analyses.\nCancer was associated with hand grip strength functional decline in old individual twins and discordant pairs. Our results strengthen the importance of comprehensive geriatric assessment in older adults with cancer, as well as the importance of routine assessment of functional status. Promoting physical activity through exercise training programmes could enable the prevention of functional decline in older adults with cancer.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD), a chondropathy associated with detachment of the subchondral bone and the overlaying cartilage, is not yet fully understood. While repetitive physical exercise-related stress is usually assumed to be the main risk factor for the occurrence of OCD, genetic predisposition could have an underestimated influence on the development of the disease.\nWe report a case of monozygotic twins with almost identical stages of bilateral osteochondrosis dissecans of the knee joint. In both patients, initially, a unilateral lesion occurred; despite restricted physical exercise, in the further course of the disease a lesion also developed on the contralateral side. While the lesion found most recently demonstrated an ongoing healing process at a 6-month follow-up, the other three lesions showed a natural course of healing under conservative treatment with significant clinical as well as radiological improvements after one year and complete consolidation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 2 years.\nThere could be a genetic component to the development of OCD, although this has not yet been proven. Based on a two-year MRI follow-up, we were able to show the self-limiting characteristics of juvenile osteochondrosis dissecans.",

    "abstract": "Studies in monozygotic (MZ) twins may help researchers elucidate the complex relationships between genetic and environmental factors on weight loss. We present a world first of MZ twins who have undergone the single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) procedure who have identical weights 3\u00a0years post-operatively. Two MZ twin 49-year-old females were assessed preoperatively and were indicated for the SADI-S procedure. They underwent surgery in 2020 by the same surgical team. Three years later post-operatively they had identical weights of 62\u00a0kg (and a BMI of 23) and %EWL of 126 and 124% respectively. SADI-S is a novel bariatric procedure for morbid obesity. Studies have found concordant epigenetic patterns in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery as well as MZ twins who have hypocaloric diets. Genetics exert a strong influence in weight management. Surgical management as well as a collaborative multidisciplinary approach is beneficial in supporting long lasting weight loss in bariatric surgery.",

    "abstract": "Autonomic function can be measured noninvasively using heart rate variability (HRV), which indexes overall sympathovagal balance. Deceleration capacity (DC) of heart rate is a more specific metric of vagal modulation. Higher values of these measures have been associated with reduced mortality risk primarily in patients with cardiovascular disease, but their significance in community samples is less clear.\nThis prospective twin study followed 501 members from the VET (Vietnam Era Twin) registry. At baseline, frequency domain HRV and DC were measured from 24-hour Holter ECGs. During an average 12-year follow-up, all-cause death was assessed via the National Death Index. Multivariable Cox frailty models with random effect for twin pair were used to examine the hazard ratios of death per 1-SD increase in log-transformed autonomic metrics. Both in the overall sample and comparing twins within pairs, higher values of low-frequency HRV and DC were significantly associated with lower hazards of all-cause death. In within-pair analysis, after adjusting for baseline factors, there was a 22% and 27% lower hazard of death per 1-SD increment in low-frequency HRV and DC, respectively. Higher low-frequency HRV and DC, measured during both daytime and nighttime, were associated with decreased hazard of death, but daytime measures showed numerically stronger associations. Results did not substantially vary by zygosity.\nAutonomic inflexibility, and especially vagal withdrawal, are important mechanistic pathways of general mortality risk, independent of familial and genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Although pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) gaps and extrapulmonary vein triggers contribute to recurrence after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation, their precise mechanisms remain unproven. Our study assessed the impact of PVI gaps on rhythm outcomes using a human AF digital twin. We included 50 patients (76.0% with persistent AF) who underwent catheter ablation with a realistic AF digital twin by integrating computed tomography and electroanatomical mapping. We evaluated the final rhythm status, including AF and atrial tachycardia (AT), across 600 AF episodes, considering factors including PVI level, PVI gap number, and pacing locations. Our findings revealed that antral PVI had a significantly lower ratio of AF at the final rhythm (28% vs. 56%, p\u2009=\u20090.002) than ostial PVI. Increasing PVI gap numbers correlated with an increased ratio of AF at the final rhythm (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Extra-PV induction yielded a higher ratio of AF at the final rhythm than internal PV induction (77.5% vs. 59.0%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In conclusion, our human AF digital twin model helped assess AF maintenance mechanisms. Clinical trial registration: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov ; Unique identifier: NCT02138695.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins bring value to mechanical and aerospace systems by speeding up development, reducing risk, predicting issues and reducing sustainment costs. Realizing these benefits at scale requires a structured and intentional approach to digital twin conception, design, development, operation and sustainment. To bring maximal value, a digital twin does not need to be an exquisite virtual replica but instead must be envisioned to be fit for purpose, where the determination of fitness depends on the capability needs and the cost-benefit trade-offs.",

    "abstract": "Here, I provide a perspective on digital twins of cities that cover a wide array of different types, ranging from aggregate economic and behavioral processes to more disaggregate agent-based, cellular and micro-simulations. A key element in these applications is the way that we as scientists, policymakers and planners interact with real cities with respect to their understanding, prediction and design. I note a range of spatial models, from analytical simulations of local neighborhoods to large-scale systems of cities and city systems, and briefly describe computational challenges that geospatial applications in cities pose.",

    "abstract": "Intracranial volume (ICV) represents the maximal brain volume for an individual, attained prior to late adolescence and remaining constant throughout life after. Thus, ICV serves as a surrogate marker for brain growth integrity. To assess the potential impact of adult-onset multiple sclerosis (MS) and its preceding prodromal subclinical changes on ICV in a large cohort of monozygotic twins clinically discordant for MS.\nFSL software was used to derive ICV estimates from 3D-T1-weighted-3\u00a0T-MRI images by using an atlas scaling factor method. ICV were compared between clinically affected and healthy co-twins. All twins were compared to a large healthy reference cohort using standardized ICV z-scores. Mixed models assessed the impact of age at MS diagnosis on ICV.\n54 twin-pairs (108 individuals/80female/42.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.98\u00a0years), 731 individuals (375 non-twins, 109/69 monozygotic/dizygotic twin-pairs; 398female/29.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13\u00a0years) and 35 healthy local individuals (20male/31.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.53\u00a0years). In 45/54 (83\u00a0%) twin-pairs, both clinically affected and healthy co-twins showed negative ICV z-scores, i.e., ICVs lower than the average of the healthy reference cohort (M\u00a0=\u00a0-1.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11, P<10\nWe offer for the first-time evidence for strong associations between adult-onset MS and lower ICV, which is more pronounced with younger age at diagnosis.

    "abstract": "The emergence of digital twins has ushered in a new era in civil engineering with a focus on achieving sustainable energy supply, real-time sensing, and rapid warning systems. These key development goals mean the arrival of Civil Engineering 4.0.The advent of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) demonstrates the feasibility of energy harvesting and self-powered sensing. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the fundamental elements comprising civil infrastructure, encompassing various structures such as buildings, pavements, rail tracks, bridges, tunnels, and ports. First, an elaboration is provided on smart engineering structures with digital twins. Following that, the paper examines the impact of using TENG-enabled strategies on smart civil infrastructure through the integration of materials and structures. The various infrastructures provided by TENGs have been analyzed to identify the key research interest. These areas encompass a wide range of civil infrastructure characteristics, including safety, efficiency, energy conservation, and other related themes. The challenges and future perspectives of TENG-enabled smart civil infrastructure are briefly discussed in the final section. In conclusion, it is conceivable that in the near future, there will be a proliferation of smart civil infrastructure accompanied by sustainable and comprehensive smart services.",

    "abstract": "The use of digital twins (DTs) has proliferated across various fields and industries, with a recent surge in the healthcare sector. The concept of digital twin for health (DT4H) holds great promise to revolutionize the entire healthcare system, including management and delivery, disease treatment and prevention, and health well-being maintenance, ultimately improving human life. The rapid growth of big data and continuous advancement in data science (DS) and artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to significantly expedite DT research and development by providing scientific expertise, essential data, and robust cybertechnology infrastructure. Although various DT initiatives have been underway in the industry, government, and military, DT4H is still in its early stages. This paper presents an overview of the current applications of DTs in healthcare, examines consortium research centers and their limitations, and surveys the current landscape of emerging research and development opportunities in healthcare. We envision the emergence of a collaborative global effort among stakeholders to enhance healthcare and improve the quality of life for millions of individuals worldwide through pioneering research and development in the realm of DT technology.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed multimodal retinal and choroidal imaging, including optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA), to assess differences and characterize variations in the retinal and choroidal structure and microvasculature between healthy monozygotic twins without ocular or systemic pathology over a five-year period. Retinal imaging of both subjects revealed normal age-related changes. There was up to\u00a0an 11% difference in OCT and OCTA variables within the subjects, both at baseline and at five years, and there was up to an 18% difference in OCT and OCTA parameters between the subjects for both time points. Larger changes in subfoveal choroidal thickness and foveal avascular zone area were observed. Our observations suggest that the parafoveal superficial capillary plexus, choroidal vascularity index, central subfield thickness, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness may be more heavily influenced by genetic, rather than environmental, factors. In contrast, subfoveal choroidal thickness and the foveal avascular zone area may be more heavily influenced by environmental factors. The environmental impact on retinal and choroidal structure and microvasculature is increasingly important to characterize, as such imaging parameters are being explored as potential biomarkers of systemic disease. These differences, as seen in these identical twin subjects, may be important considerations in supporting the security of biometric identifiers.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins can accelerate sustainable development by leveraging big data and artificial intelligence to simulate state, reactions and potential developments of physical systems. In doing so, they can create a comprehensive basis for data-driven policy decisions. One of the purposes of digital twins is to facilitate the implementation of the EU's Green Deal-in line with internationally binding climate and environmental targets. One prerequisite for the success of digital twins is a comprehensive, high-quality database. This requires a suitable legal framework that ensures access to such data.\nApplying a qualitative governance analysis, the following article examines if the EU's strategies and legal acts on data governance are paving the way for digital twin projects which promote sustainability.\nResults show important starting points for open and fair data use within the growing field of EU digital law. However, there is still a lot of progress to be made to legally link the use of digital twins with binding sustainability objectives.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge for personalized medicine is to capture enough of the complexity of an individual patient to determine an optimal way to keep them healthy or restore their health. This will require personalized computational models of sufficient resolution and with enough mechanistic information to provide actionable information to the clinician. Such personalized models are increasingly referred to as medical digital twins. Digital twin technology for health applications is still in its infancy, and extensive research and development is required. This article focuses on several projects in different stages of development that can lead to specific-and practical-medical digital twins or digital twin modeling platforms. It emerged from a two-day forum on problems related to medical digital twins, particularly those involving an immune system component. Open access video recordings of the forum discussions are available.",

    "abstract": "Fetuses undergo major surgical stress as well as fluid shifts secondary to both twin-twin transfusion (TTTS) as well as the fetoscopic surgery for treatment of TTTS. While the pathophysiology of TTTS is understood, the acute metabolic changes that fetuses experience from fetoscopic surgery are not. We sought to evaluate the changes in recipient metabolomic profile secondary to TTTS surgery. Amniotic fluid was collected at the beginning and end of four TTTS surgical cases performed from 12/2022-2/2023. Samples were immediately processed and evaluated via NMR-based Metabolomics Facility protocol. In univariate analysis, 12 metabolites (glucose, lactate, and 10 key amino acids) showed statistically significant changes between the beginning and end of the surgery. Among these, 11 metabolites decreased at the end, while only lactate increased. Supervised oPLS-DA modeling revealed pyruvate and lactate as the two metabolites most impact on the variance between cases, and that 40% of metabolomic changes could be attributed directly to the timing that the sample was taken (i.e., if pre- or postoperatively). These results indicate significant metabolic changes in the recipient twin during fetoscopic surgery for TTTS. These findings of decreased glucose, increased lactate, and decreased amnio acids would indicate increased catabolism during surgery. This study raises questions regarding optimal maternal and fetal nutrition during surgery and if nutritional status could be optimized to further improve twin survival during fetoscopic surgery.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity is a multidimensional concept that can be understood and measured in many different ways. However, the next generation of digital technologies for biodiversity monitoring currently being funded and developed fail to engage its multidimensional and relational aspects. Based on empirical data from interviews, a conference visit, online meetings, webinars, and project reports, this study articulates four digital logics that structure how biodiversity becomes monitored and understood within recent technological developments. The four digital logics illustrate how intensified practices of capturing, connecting, simulating, and computing produce particular techno-scientific formats for creating biodiversity knowledge. While ongoing projects advance technological development in areas of automation, prediction, and the creation of large-scale species databases, their developmental processes structurally limit the future of biodiversity technology. To better address the complex challenges of the global biodiversity crisis, it is crucial to develop digital technologies and practices that can engage with a wider range of perspectives and understandings of relational and multidimensional approaches to biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Disturbances in gut microbiota are prevalent in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC). However, whether these disturbances contribute to development of the disease or are a result of the disease is unclear. In pairs of human twins discordant for IBD, the healthy twin has a higher risk of developing IBD and a gut microbiota that is more similar to that of IBD patients as compared with healthy individuals. Furthermore, appropriate medical treatment may mitigate these disturbances. To study the correlation between microbiota and IBD, we transferred stool samples from a discordant human twin pair: one twin being healthy and the other receiving treatment for UC. The stool samples were transferred from the disease-discordant twins to germ-free pregnant dams. Colitis was induced in the offspring using dextran sodium sulfate. As compared with offspring born to mice dams inoculated with stool from the healthy cotwin, offspring born to dams inoculated with stool from the UC-afflicted twin had a lower disease activity index, less gut inflammation, and a microbiota characterized by higher \u03b1 diversity and a more antiinflammatory profile that included the presence and higher abundance of antiinflammatory species such as ",

    "abstract": "There has been a notable rise in instances of multiple-fetus pregnancies over the last decade, attributed to the widespread adoption of assisted reproductive technologies. Moreover, these pregnancies have been associated with the use of drugs to induce ovulation. While some cases involve the loss of one twin with minimal consequences for the surviving twin, the demise of a fetus after the first trimester, especially beyond three months into the pregnancy, can significantly impact the health of both the mother and the surviving fetus. Unfavorable outcomes linked to the loss of one twin after the first trimester include impaired physical growth of the surviving fetus, preterm delivery, neurological abnormalities, and, in certain instances, the death of the surviving twin. This report provides a detailed account of a specific case involving twin pregnancies where a single fetal death occurred at the 24th week of gestation, leading to severe pregnancy-induced hypertension and pulmonary edema. Upon reviewing peer-reviewed articles related to similar cases in online databases, no exact matches were identified for cases with a comparable presentation. The scarcity of literature on the development of pre-eclampsia following the death of a single fetus suggests a gap in obstetric research in this area. Consequently, the uniqueness of this case report arises from its distinctive circumstances and the limited existing literature on the subject within the obstetric community.",

Combustion systems are complex and difficult to predict, and high-fidelity simulations are out of reach for practical systems because of computational cost. Data-driven approaches and artificial intelligence offer promising solutions, enabling renewable synthetic fuels to meet decarbonization goals. We discuss open challenges associated with the availability and fidelity of data, physics-based numerical simulations, and machine learning, focusing on developing digital twins capable of mirroring the behavior of industrial combustion systems and continuously updating based on newly available information.",

    "abstract": "Virtual patients and digital patients/twins are two similar concepts gaining increasing attention in health care with goals to accelerate drug development and improve patients' survival, but with their own limitations. Although methods have been proposed to generate virtual patient populations using mechanistic models, there are limited number of applications in immuno-oncology research. Furthermore, due to the stricter requirements of digital twins, they are often generated in a study-specific manner with models customized to particular clinical settings (e.g., treatment, cancer, and data types). Here, we discuss the challenges for virtual patient generation in immuno-oncology with our most recent experiences, initiatives to develop digital twins, and how research on these two concepts can inform each other.",

    "abstract": "Digital twin technology is a highly valued asset in the manufacturing sector, with its unique capability to bridge the gap between the physical and virtual parts. The impact of the rapid increase in this technology is based on the collection of real-world data, its standardization, and its widespread deployment on an existing manufacturing system. This encompasses sensor values, PLC internal states, and IoT, as well as how the means of linking these data with their digital counterparts. It is challenging to implement digital twins on a large scale due to the heterogeneity of protocols and data structuring of subsystems. To facilitate the integration of the digital twin into existing manufacturing architectures, we propose in this paper a framework that enables the deployment of scalable digital twins from sensors to services of digital twins in an iterative manner.",

    "abstract": "Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a rare clinical entity arising from the extrinsic compression of the coeliac axis by the median arcuate ligament. In this report, we detail a unique presentation involving monozygotic twins, both of whom demonstrated anatomical extrinsic compression of the coeliac axis by the median arcuate ligament. Intriguingly, only one twin manifested clinical symptoms consistent with MALS, despite comparable anatomical compression of the coeliac axis observed in both. This case highlights the potential interplay of a genetic or anatomical predisposition to coeliac axis compression and secondary, possibly environmental, factors that lead to the development of clinical symptoms. In this report, we explore various determinants potentially influencing symptomatology in MALS and advocate for the publication of similar case studies to further elucidate this rare condition.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of birth weight discordant twins (BWDT) who were premature and appropriate-for-gestational-age or large-for-gestational-age. Additionally, it assessed the impact of birth weight discordance on the prognosis of appropriately grown premature twins, and investigated the effect of maternal factors on neonatal outcomes.\nThis retrospective cohort study included twins who were born alive after preterm labor at the Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital from January 2018 to December 2021, along with their mothers. Twins were arranged into discordant and concordant groups according to intertwin birth weight discordance, followed by the analysis of the clinical characteristics of mothers and the prognosis of neonates.\nA total of 585 mothers and 1170 neonates were included, with 47 mothers and 94 neonates in the discordant group. The incidence of birth weight discordance was 8.0% (94/1,170) in appropriately grown premature twins. The incidence of complications (43.2% vs. 21.8%) and transfer to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (53.2% vs. 29.2%) was higher in the discordant group than in the concordant group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furthermore, the incidence of infectious diseases (36.7% vs. 19.4%), necrotizing enterocolitis (7.6% vs. 1.6%), and oxygen therapy rate (22.8% vs. 12.8%) were statistically significantly higher in the discordant group than in the concordant group (\nBirth weight discordance remains a high-risk factor for complications and transfer to the NICU in appropriately grown premature twins.

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to compare maternal, chorionicity and neonatal complications in monochorionic (MC) twins between spontaneously conceived (SC) and assisted reproductive technologies (ART) pregnancies.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study between January 2010 to December 2019 at a tertiary referral University center. All consecutive pregnancies with MC twins that delivered at our University hospital were included. Maternal, chorionicity and neonatal complications were recorded and compared between SC and ART pregnancies.\n393 MC pregnancies were included for final analysis, including 353 (89.8%) SC and 40 (10.2%) pregnancies conceived after ART. Hypothyroidism was the only maternal condition seen significantly more often in ART pregnancies (35.0% vs 12.5%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). There were no significant differences in chorionicity complications, such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome, selective fetal growth restriction and twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (40.0% in ART pregnancies vs 31.6% in SC pregnancies, p\u00a0=\u00a00.291). At least one congenital anomaly in one twin was seen significantly more often in ART pregnancies (18.8% vs 8.1%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), especially congenital heart defects (16.3% vs 6.2%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). There were no other significant differences in neonatal outcomes between both groups, however, there were non-significant trends in gestational age at delivery (34 weeks in ART pregnancies vs 35 weeks, p\u00a0=\u00a00.078) and birthweight (1951\u00a0g\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0747 in ART pregnancies vs 2143\u00a0g\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0579, p\u00a0=\u00a00.066).\nThis is the largest cohort study to date comparing maternal, chorionicity and neonatal complications between MC twin pregnancies after ART and after SC. Hypothyroidism was the only maternal condition occurring more frequently in pregnancies conceived after ART. There were no significant differences in chorionicity complications, in contrast to previously reported studies. While MC twins and ART pregnancies per se are known to be at risk for congenital heart defects, there seems to be a cumulative effect in MC pregnancies conceived after ART.\nDas Ziel dieser Studie war es, die m\u00fctterlichen, neonatalen und chorionizit\u00e4tsbedingte Komplikationen von monochorialen (MC) Zwillingen bei spontan gezeugten (SG) bzw. mit Techniken der assistierten Reproduktion (ART) gezeugten Kindern zu vergleichen.\nDiese retrospektive Kohortenstudie untersucht den Zeitraum von Januar 2010 bis Dezember 2019 in einem Universit\u00e4tsklinikum der Maximalversorgung. Alle konsekutiven in unserem Universit\u00e4tskrankenhaus entbundenen Schwangerschaften mit MC Zwillingen wurden in die Studie aufgenommen. Die m\u00fctterlichen, neonatalen und chorionizit\u00e4tsbedingten Komplikationen wurden aufgezeichnet und ihr Auftreten in SG- und ART-Schwangerschaften wurde verglichen.\nInsgesamt wurden 393 MC Schwangerschaften in die Endanalyse aufgenommen, davon waren 353 (89,8%) SG- und 40 (10,2%) ART-Schwangerschaften. Die Schilddr\u00fcsenunterfunktion war die einzige m\u00fctterliche Komplikation, die signifikant h\u00e4ufiger bei ART-Schwangerschaften auftrat (35,0% vs. 12,5%, p\u00a0=\u00a00,001). Es gab keine signifikanten Unterschiede in den chorionizit\u00e4tsbedingten Komplikationen wie fetofetales Transfusionssyndrom, selektive fetale Wachstumsrestriktion und Zwillings-An\u00e4mie-Polyzyth\u00e4mie-Sequenz (40,0% in ART-Schwangerschaften vs. 31,6% in SG-Schwangerschaften, p\u00a0=\u00a00,291). Bei ART-Schwangerschaften trat mindestens eine angeborene Anomalie bei einem Zwilling signifikant h\u00e4ufiger auf (18,8% vs. 8,1%, p\u00a0=\u00a00,004), insbesondere angeborene Herzfehler (16,3% vs. 6,2%, p\u00a0=\u00a00,005). Es gab keine anderen signifikanten Unterschiede in den neonatalen Outcomes zwischen beiden Gruppen; es gab aber nichtsignifikante Trends hinsichtlich des Schwangerschaftsalters bei der Entbindung (34 Wochen f\u00fcr ART-Schwangerschaften vs. 35 Wochen, p\u00a0=\u00a00,078) und des Geburtsgewichts (1951\u00a0g\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0747 f\u00fcr ART-Schwangerschaften vs. 2143\u00a0g\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0579, p\u00a0=\u00a00,066).\nEs handelt sich hier um die bislang gr\u00f6\u00dfte Kohortenstudie, die m\u00fctterliche, neonatale und chorionizit\u00e4tsbedingte Komplikationen in MC Zwillingsschwangerschaften untersucht und das Auftreten von Komplikationen in ART-Schwangerschaften mit denen in SG-Schwangerschaften vergleicht. Die Schilddr\u00fcsenunterfunktion war die einzige m\u00fctterliche Komplikation, die h\u00e4ufiger bei ART-Schwangerschaften auftat. Im Gegensatz zu fr\u00fcheren Studien gab es keine signifikanten Unterschiede in den chorionizit\u00e4tsbedingten Komplikationen. W\u00e4hrend MC Zwillinge und ART-Schwangerschaften bekanntlich ein h\u00f6heres Risiko f\u00fcr angeborene Herzfehler haben, scheint es einen kumulativen Effekt bei mit ART gezeugten MC Schwangerschaften zu geben.",

    "conclusions": "This is the largest cohort study to date comparing maternal, chorionicity and neonatal complications between MC twin pregnancies after ART and after SC. Hypothyroidism was the only maternal condition occurring more frequently in pregnancies conceived after ART. There were no significant differences in chorionicity complications, in contrast to previously reported studies. While MC twins and ART pregnancies per se are known to be at risk for congenital heart defects, there seems to be a cumulative effect in MC pregnancies conceived after ART.",

    "abstract": "Twin growth discordance is one of the leading causes of perinatal mortality in twin pregnancies. Whether prenatal exposure to heavy metals and trace elements is associated with twin growth discordance has not been studied yet.\nTo evaluate the prenatal level of heavy metals and trace elements in twin pregnancy and its relationship with twin growth discordance.\nThis study involving 60 twin pairs and their mothers was conducted in Zhejiang Province, China, in 2020-2021. The concentration of heavy metals and trace elements in maternal blood, umbilical cord, and placenta were collected at delivery and measured by inductively coupled plasma tandem mass spectrometer. The association of prenatal level with twin growth discordance was evaluated using conditional logistic regression.\nHigh levels of heavy metal elements (thallium in maternal blood and umbilical cord blood of larger twins, vanadium in the placenta of larger twins) and trace elements (iodine in the placenta of larger twins) during pregnancy, as well as low levels of heavy metal elements (strontium in the umbilical cord blood of larger twins, strontium and chromium in the umbilical cord blood of smaller twins, strontium in the placenta of larger twins, molybdenum and lead in the placenta of smaller twins and difference of molybdenum in the placenta of twins), are associated with intertwin birthweight discordance. Univariate regression analyses showed a significant effect of gestational age at delivery and eleven trace element data on intertwin birthweight discordance. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with transformed variables as dichotomous risk factors combined with baseline demographic characteristics showed Tl in maternal blood as an independent risk factor. The model constructed by combining Tl in maternal blood (OR\u2009=\u200954.833, 95% CI, 3.839-83.156) with the gestational week (OR\u2009=\u20090.618, 95% CI, 0.463-0.824) had good predictive power for intertwin birthweight discordance (AUC\u2009=\u20090.871). The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the effect of maternal blood thallium on intertwin birthweight discordance is stable and reliable.\nTo our knowledge, ours is the first case-control study to investigate the association between elevated maternal thallium levels before delivery and twin growth discordance.",

    "abstract": "Genetic influences on cerebral activity have been described previously, but data are scarce in preterms. We aimed to investigate whether a genetic influence causes amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) signals to differ between singletons and twin preterm newborns.\nThis was a retrospective single-centre study conducted at Innsbruck Medical University Hospital, Austria. Preterm infants born before 32\u2009weeks of gestation between 6 November 2010 and 6 December 2022 were eligible for the study. The aEEG was analysed for the total maturation score, its component scores and the number of sleep-wake cycles per hour.\nWe enrolled 240 preterm twin infants (57.5% male) with a mean gestational age of 30 (range: 24-32) weeks and a mean birth weight of 1324 (range: 600-2116) grams. We compared 240 singleton matched preterms. No differences were found between preterm singletons and twin preterm infants regarding the total maturation and component scores, or the number of sleep-wake cycles. aEEG showed no difference between monozygotic and dizygotic twins.\nCompared to singletons, twin infants born preterm showed no differences in aEEG signals in the first 4\u2009weeks of life. Future studies should include more complex non-invasive functional neuroimaging methods to gain more insight into this important topic.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen an increasing interest in incorporating external control data for designing and evaluating randomized clinical trials (RCT). This may decrease costs and shorten inclusion times by reducing sample sizes. For small populations, with limited recruitment, this can be especially important. Bayesian dynamic borrowing (BDB) has been a popular choice as it claims to protect against potential prior data conflict. Digital twins (DT) has recently been proposed as another method to utilize historical data. DT, also known as PROCOVA\u2122, is based on constructing a prognostic score from historical control data, typically using machine learning. This score is included in a pre-specified ANCOVA as the primary analysis of the RCT. The promise of this idea is power increase while guaranteeing strong type 1 error control. In this paper, we apply analytic derivations and simulations to analyze and discuss examples of these two approaches. We conclude that BDB and DT, although similar in scope, have fundamental differences which need be considered in the specific application. The inflation of the type 1 error is a serious issue for BDB, while more evidence is needed of a tangible value of DT for real RCTs.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an autosomal dominantly inherited cerebral small vessel disease caused by Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 3 (NOTCH3) gene mutations. The main clinical features include migraine with aura, recurrent ischemic strokes and dementia. Brain MRI typically shows multiple small lacunar infarcts and severe, diffuse, symmetrical white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), with characteristic involvement of the anterior temporal pole, external capsule, and superior frontal gyrus. Reports of twins with CADASIL are scarce. Herein we describe a pair of monozygotic twins with peculiar CADASIL phenotype, carrying a new NOTCH3 variant.\nTwin A was a 45-year-old male suffering from migraine, obesity, arterial hypertension, and polycythemia (with negative genetic analysis), who complained of a transient, short-lasting (~ 5 minutes) episode of speech difficulties. Brain MRI showed diffuse, symmetrical, confluent periventricular WMHs involving frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes and external capsules, with sparing of anterior temporal poles. Genetic analysis of NOTCH3 gene demonstrated the presence of missense c.3329G>A, p.(Cys1110Tyr) variant, confirming CADASIL diagnosis. Twin B, affected by migraine and polycythemia, as well as his monozygotic twin, presented with a 2-month history of trigeminal neuralgia. Brain MRI demonstrated diffuse WMHs with a pattern of distribution like his twin. Genetic analysis revealed the same NOTCH3 pathogenic variant.\nOur monozygotic twins have a strikingly similar neuroimaging picture with sparing of anterior temporal poles. They also have a peculiar phenotype, both presenting polycythemia without genetically confirmed cause. Twin B had trigeminal neuralgia, that is unusual in CADASIL. The possible association of the peculiar findings with the newly reported NOTCH3 variant needs to be confirmed with further observations.",

    "abstract": "To characterize the neonatal hemodynamic profiles in recipients born after twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) treated with fetoscopic selective laser coagulation (FSLC). Retrospective analysis during the first month of life of recipient twins. Of the 480 newborns born during an 11-year period, 138 recipient twins with prenatal FSLC were classified into four groups: no hemodynamic impairment (NoHI, n\u2009=\u2009102, 74%), isolated high blood pressure (HighBP, n\u2009=\u200918, 13%), right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOTO, n\u2009=\u200910, 7%), and cardiac failure (CF, n\u2009=\u20098, 6%). The time (median (IQR)) between FSLC and birth was significantly shorter in the HighBP (36\u00a0days (23-54)) and CF (44\u00a0days (18-54)) groups than in the RVOTO (91\u00a0days (68-112)) and NoHi (82\u00a0days (62-104)) groups (p\u2009<\u20090.001). \u00a0 \u00a0 Conclusion:\u00a0Four distinct and well-characterized groups of recipients were identified based on their hemodynamics. High blood pressure and heart failure occurred in approximately 20% of the infants and were associated with a time between laser coagulation and birth of less than 2\u00a0months. What is Known: \u2022 Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is characterized by a hemodynamic imbalance that leads to high fetal and neonatal mortality if left untreated. One-third of recipient twins born without prenatal fetoscopic laser coagulation (FSLC) develop a life-threatening cardiac failure. What is New: \u2022 Four distinct groups of recipient twins with prenatal FSLC have been identified based on their hemodynamics. High blood pressure and cardiac failure occurred in 20% of the infants and were associated with an interval between FSLC and birth of less than 2\u00a0months.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that genetic factors are important in the development of degenerative disk disease (DDD). However, the concordance rates for the phenotypes requiring surgery are unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the concordance rates for DDD requiring surgery by studying monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs.\nPatients, aged between 18 and 85\u00a0years, operated for DDD between 1996 and 2022 were identified in the national Swedish spine register (Swespine) and matched with the Swedish twin registry (STR) to identify MZ and DZ twins. Pairwise and probandwise concordance rates were calculated.\nWe identified 11,207 patients, 53% women, operated for DDD. By matching the Swespine patients with the STR, we identified 121 twin pairs (37 MZ and 84 DZ) where one or both twins were surgically treated for DDD. The total twin incidence for operated DDD was 1.1%. For DDD requiring surgery, we found no concordant MZ pair and no concordant DZ pair where both twins were operated for DDD. When we evaluated pairs where at least one twin was operated for DDD, we found two concordant MZ pairs (the co-twins were operated for spinal stenosis) and two\u00a0 concordant DZ pairs (one co-twin operated for spinal stenosis and one (co-twin operated for disk herniation).\nOur findings suggest that genetic factors are probably not a major etiologic component in most cases of DDD requiring surgery. The findings of this study can be used for counseling patients about the risk for requiring DDD surgery.",

    "abstract": "We assessed prevalence and correlates of differential maternal-infant bonding (i.e., experiencing a stronger bond with one baby vs. the other) in mothers of twins, focusing on aspects of maternal mental health, well-being, and pregnancy/birth that have been previously linked with maternal-infant bonding. Participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0108 American women, 88.89% White, 82.41% non-Hispanic, aged 18-45, who gave birth to twins in the past 6-24\u00a0weeks) were recruited from postpartum support websites. Participants completed a Qualtrics survey assessing pregnancy/birth history, symptoms of depression and anxiety, sleep, stress, romantic relationship satisfaction, and postpartum bonding. Twenty-six participants (24.07%) reported a bonding discrepancy. These participants endorsed higher symptoms of depression and anxiety, lower relationship satisfaction, lower average postpartum bonding, higher general and parenting stress, and longer pregnancy (all ps\u00a0>\u00a0.05). Greater degree of bonding discrepancy correlated with more depression, higher parenting stress, longer pregnancy, and lower relationship satisfaction (all ps\u00a0>\u00a0.05). Mothers of twins may benefit from postpartum mental health support, stress management strategies, and interventions to improve bonding. Future work should assess the role of breastfeeding difficulties, delivery method, birth-related trauma, infant regulatory capacity, and temperament. Longitudinal studies will help test cause and effect and potential long-term repercussions of maternal-infant bonding discrepancies.\nEvaluamos la prevalencia y factores correlacionados del apego afectivo diferencial materno\u2010infantil (v.g. experimentar un apego m\u00e1s fuerte con un beb\u00e9 vs. el otro) en madres de gemelos, enfoc\u00e1ndonos en aspectos de salud mental materna, bienestar, as\u00ed como el embarazo/parto que previamente han sido relacionadas con la afectividad materno\u2010infantil. A las participantes (N = 108 mujeres estadounidenses, 88.89% blancas, 82.41% no hispanas, de 18\u201045 a\u00f1os, que dieron a luz gemelos en las pasadas 6\u201024 semanas) se les reclut\u00f3 de los sitios de apoyo posterior al parto en la red. Las participantes completaron una encuesta Qualtrics para evaluar el historial de embarazo/parto, los s\u00edntomas de depresi\u00f3n y ansiedad, el sue\u00f1o, el estr\u00e9s, la satisfacci\u00f3n con la relaci\u00f3n rom\u00e1ntica, as\u00ed como la afectividad posterior al parto. Veintis\u00e9is participantes (24.07%) reportaron discrepancia en el apego afectivo. Estas participantes confirmaron s\u00edntomas m\u00e1s altos de depresi\u00f3n y ansiedad, m\u00e1s baja satisfacci\u00f3n en la relaci\u00f3n, m\u00e1s bajo promedio de apego afectivo posterior al parto, m\u00e1s alto estr\u00e9s general y de crianza, as\u00ed como un m\u00e1s largo embarazo (todos los ps > .05). Un mayor grado de discrepancia en el apego afectivo se relacion\u00f3 con m\u00e1s depresi\u00f3n, un m\u00e1s alto estr\u00e9s de crianza, un m\u00e1s largo embarazo, as\u00ed como una m\u00e1s baja satisfacci\u00f3n en la relaci\u00f3n (todos los ps > .05). Las madres de gemelos pudieran beneficiarse de un apoyo de salud mental posterior al parto, estrategias de c\u00f3mo arregl\u00e1rselas con el estr\u00e9s e intervenciones para mejorar el apego afectivo. El trabajo futuro debe evaluar el papel de las dificultades de amamantar, el m\u00e9todo usado para dar a luz, el trauma relacionado con el nacimiento, la capacidad regulatoria del infante y el temperamento. Estudios longitudinales ayudar\u00e1n a poner a prueba la causa y el efecto las potenciales repercusiones a largo plazo de las discrepancias en el apego afectivo materno\u2010infantil.\nNous avons \u00e9valu\u00e9 la pr\u00e9valence et les corr\u00e9lats du lien maternel\u2010b\u00e9b\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentiel (c'est\u2010\u00e0\u2010dire qui font l'exp\u00e9rience d'un lien plus fort avec un b\u00e9b\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 l'autre) chez les m\u00e8res de jumeaux ou jumelles, en mettant l'accent sur les aspects de la sant\u00e9 mentale maternelle, le bien\u2010\u00eatre et la grossesse/naissance ayant pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9t\u00e9 li\u00e9s au lien maternel\u2010b\u00e9b\u00e9.

Die Teilnehmerinnen (N = 108 amerikanische Frauen, 88,89 % wei\u00df, 82,41 % nicht\u2010hispanisch, im Alter von 18 bis 45 Jahren, die in den letzten 6 bis 24 Wochen Zwillinge zur Welt gebracht hatten) wurden \u00fcber Websites zur Unterst\u00fctzung nach der Geburt rekrutiert. Die Teilnehmerinnen f\u00fcllten eine Qualtrics\u2010Umfrage aus, in der sie die Schwangerschafts\u2010/Geburtsgeschichte, Depressions\u2010 und Angstsymptome, Schlaf, Stress, Zufriedenheit in der Partnerschaft und die Bindung nach der Geburt beurteilten. Sechsundzwanzig Teilnehmerinnen (24,07 %) gaben eine Diskrepanz in der Bindung an. Diese Teilnehmerinnen gaben h\u00f6here Depressions\u2010 und Angstsymptome, geringere Zufriedenheit in der Paarbeziehung, eine durchschnittlich schw\u00e4chere Bindung nach der Geburt, einen h\u00f6heren allgemeinen und elterlichen Stress sowie eine l\u00e4ngere Schwangerschaft an (alle ps > .05). Ein h\u00f6heres Ma\u00df an Bindungsdiskrepanz korrelierte mit schwererer Depression, h\u00f6herem elterlichem Stress, l\u00e4ngerer Schwangerschaft und geringerer Zufriedenheit in der Paarbeziehung (alle ps > .05). M\u00fctter von Zwillingen k\u00f6nnten von postpartaler psychischer Unterst\u00fctzung, Stressbew\u00e4ltigungsstrategien und Interventionen zur Verbesserung der Bindung profitieren. Zuk\u00fcnftige Forschung sollte die Rolle von Stillschwierigkeiten, der Entbindungsmethode, geburtsbedingtem Trauma, kindlicher Regulationsf\u00e4higkeit und Temperament untersuchen. L\u00e4ngsschnittstudien werden dazu beitragen, Ursache und Wirkung sowie m\u00f6gliche langfristige Auswirkungen von Diskrepanzen in der Mutter\u2010Kind\u2010Bindung zu

    "abstract": "Digital twin technology has become increasingly popular and has revolutionized data integration and system modeling across various industries, such as manufacturing, energy, and healthcare. This study aims to explore the evolving research landscape of digital twins using Keyword Co-occurrence Network (KCN) analysis. We analyze metadata from 9639 peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2023. The results unfold in two parts. The first part examines trends and keyword interconnection over time, and the second part maps sensing technology keywords to six application areas. This study reveals that research on digital twins is rapidly diversifying, with focused themes such as predictive and decision-making functions. Additionally, there is an emphasis on real-time data and point cloud technologies. The advent of federated learning and edge computing also highlights a shift toward distributed computation, prioritizing data privacy. This study confirms that digital twins have evolved into complex systems that can conduct predictive operations through advanced sensing technologies. The discussion also identifies challenges in sensor selection and empirical knowledge integration.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are identical twins joined in utero and are a rare phenomenon. This report discusses a case of female thoraco-omphalo-ischiopagus tripus conjoined twins. The twins were separated at age two, and once medically stable, spent one month in inpatient rehabilitation to improve their sitting balance and gross motor skills. This was followed by outpatient physical therapy. The twins initially had customized ZipZac seats, which they were able to wheel independently. After six months of therapy, the girls began walking with posterior walkers and prostheses. The hemipelvectomy prosthesis included a customized thoracolumbosacral orthosis component and was directly attached to a non-articulated pylon. A manual-locking hip joint was added to accommodate sitting. An articulated ankle-foot orthosis was used for the intact leg. Care of formerly conjoined twins requires comprehensive care from a multidisciplinary team involving, but not limited to, a physiatrist, orthopaedic surgeon, physical therapist, and orthotist/prosthetist. Complex congenital limb deficiencies are often a major undertaking for the rehabilitation team as continuous treatment and management are needed throughout the patient's lifetime due to growth, development, and evolving physical demands. Anatomic variations must be examined on a case-by-case basis but often include limb deficiencies, orthopedic abnormalities, and organ comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "Digital health twins (DHTs) have been evolving with their diverse applications in medicine, specifically in older care settings, with the increasing demands of older adults. DHTs have already contributed to improving the quality of dementia and trauma care, cardiac treatment, and health care services for older individuals. Despite its many benefits, the optimum implementation of DHTs has faced several challenges associated with ethical issues, quality of care, management and leadership, and design considerations in older care settings. Since the need for such care is continuously rising and there is evident potential for DHTs to meet those needs, this review aims to map key concepts to address the gaps in the research knowledge to improve DHT implementation.\nThe review aims to compile and synthesize the best available evidence regarding the problems encountered by older adults and care providers associated with the application of DHTs. The synthesis will collate the evidence of the issues associated with quality of care, the ethical implications of DHTs, and the strategies undertaken to overcome those challenges in older care settings.\nThe review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology. The published studies will be searched through CINAHL, MEDLINE, JBI, and Web of Science, and the unpublished studies through Mednar, Trove, OCLC WorldCat, and Dissertations and Theses. Studies published in English from 2002 will be considered. This review will include studies of older individuals (aged 65 years or older) undergoing care delivery associated with DHTs and their respective care providers. The concept will include the application of the technology, and the context will involve studies based on the older care setting. A broad scope of evidence, including quantitative, qualitative, text and opinion studies, will be considered. A total of 2 independent reviewers will screen the titles and abstracts and then review the full text. Data will be extracted from the included studies using a data extraction tool developed for this study.\nThe results will be presented in a PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews) flow diagram. A draft charting table will be developed as a data extraction tool. The results will be presented as a \"map\" of the data in a logical, diagrammatic, or tabular form in a descriptive format.\nThe evidence synthesis is expected to uncover the shreds of evidence required to address the ethical and care quality-related challenges associated with applying DHTs. A synthesis of various strategies used to overcome identified challenges will provide more prospects for adopting them elsewhere and create a resource allocation model for older individuals.\nDERR1-10.2196/51153.",

    "abstract": "Ocular surface disease is common and it is associated with elevated concentration levels of cytokines in tear fluid. Studies of the normal variation in tear fluid inflammatory markers are lacking. New knowledge may help guide research into ocular surface disease biomarkers and therapeutics.\nIn this prospective twin cohort study, healthy individuals were recruited from a population-based registry. Tear fluid was collected with the Schirmer test strips was submerged in phosphate buffered saline and stored at -80\u00b0 before undergoing 27-cytokine multiplex immunoassay analysis. Broad-sense heritability (h\n90 participants (23 monozygotic and 22 dizygotic twin pairs) were included. Data availability allowed for heritability analysis of 15 cytokines, and a h\nThe tear fluid concentration of several analyzed cytokines was found to be highly heritable. A considerable amount of the inter-individual variation observed for the concentration of certain tear fluid cytokines can be linked to hereditary factors that cannot easily be modified by changing factors in the environment of patients. This suggests that a higher success in ocular surface disease drug discovery may be anticipated for drugs that have targets in specific populations, and points to the importance of emphasizing known preventive measures of ocular surface disease and examinations of close relatives of patients with ocular surface disease, such as dry eye disease.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence to suggest a potential genetic component underlying the development and progression of lumbar spine diseases. However, the heritability and the concordance rates for the phenotypes requiring surgery for the common spine diseases lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) and lumbar disc herniation (LDH) are unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the heritability and the concordance rates for LSS and LDH requiring surgery by studying monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs.\nPatients between 18 and 85 years of age who underwent surgery for LSS or LDH between 1996 and 2022 were identified in the national Swedish spine registry (LSS: 45,110 patients; LDH: 39,272 patients), and matched with the Swedish Twin Registry to identify MZ and DZ twins. Pairwise and probandwise concordance rates, heritability estimates, and MZ/DZ concordance ratios were calculated.\nWe identified 414 twin pairs (92 MZ and 322 DZ pairs) of whom 1 or both twins underwent surgery for LSS. The corresponding number for LDH was 387 twin pairs (118 MZ and 269 DZ pairs). The probandwise concordance rate for LSS requiring surgery was 0.25 (26 of 105) (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14 to 0.34) for MZ twins and 0.04 (12 of 328) (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.07) for DZ twins. The corresponding values for LDH requiring surgery were 0.03 (4 of 120) (95% CI, 0 to 0.08) and 0.01 (4 of 271) (95% CI, 0 to 0.04), respectively. The probandwise MZ/DZ concordance ratio was 6.8 (95% CI, 2.9 to 21.5) for LSS and 2.3 (95% CI, 0 to 8.9) for LDH. The heritability was significantly higher in LSS compared with LDH (0.64 [95% CI, 0.50 to 0.74] versus 0.19 [95% CI, 0.08 to 0.35]).\nOur findings suggest that genetic factors may play an important role in the risk of developing LSS requiring surgery, whereas heredity seems to be of less importance in LDH requiring surgery.\nPrognostic Level III .

    "abstract": "Pituitary gland height reflects secretory activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis.\nTo assess the cumulative impact of fetal growth and sex on pituitary gland height in premature twins, dissociated from prematurity.\nA retrospective study was conducted, assessing the pituitary gland height in 63 pairs of preterm twins, measured from T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Auxological parameters, including body weight, body length, and head circumference, at birth and at the time of MRI, were used as proxies for fetal and postnatal growth, respectively. The study population was divided into two groups, using corrected age at around term equivalent as the cutoff point. Statistical analysis was performed using mixed-effects linear regression models.\nWhen pituitary gland height was evaluated at around term equivalent, a greater pituitary gland height, suggesting a more immature hypothamo-pituitary axis, was associated with the twin exhibiting lower auxological data at birth. The same association was observed when body weight and length at MRI were used as covariants. In the group evaluated after term equivalent, a smaller pituitary gland height, suggesting a more mature hypothamo-pituitary axis, was associated with male sex. This difference was observed in twin pairs with higher average body weight at birth, and in babies exhibiting higher auxological data at MRI.\nAfter isolating the effect of prematurity, at around term equivalent, pituitary gland height reflects the cumulative impact of fetal growth on the hypothalamo-pituitary axis. Subsequently, pituitary gland height shows effects of sex and of fetal and postnatal growth.",

I met with many new research collaborators and students while on a fall 2023\u00a0four-city lecture tour in that country. A meeting with a world-famous surgeon who recently separated craniopagus conjoined twin pairs is also described. This overview is followed by summaries of twin research on binge eating, twins' physical outcomes linked to different diets, working conditions and sickness absence in Swedish Twins and facial morphology differences in monozygotic twins. The final section of this article provides a sampling of human interest stories with important implications. They include a Michigan family forced to adopt their own twins, ethical issues surrounding the hiring of a surrogate to bear twins; twin survivors of the Israel-Hamas war, a twin pregnancy with a double uterus, and three twin pairs on the same women's soccer team.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies of singletons evaluating prenatal phthalate exposure and early neurodevelopment reported mixed results and the associations could be biased by parental, obstetrical, and genetic factors.\nA co-twin control design was employed to test whether prenatal phthalate exposure was associated with children's neurocognitive development. We collected information from 97 mother-twin pairs enrolled in the Wuhan Twin Birth Cohort between March 2016 and October 2018. Fourteen phthalate metabolites were measured in maternal urine collected at each trimester. Neurodevelopmental differences in twins at the age of two were examined as the outcome of interest. Multiple informant model was used to examine the covariate-adjusted associations of prenatal phthalate exposure with mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) scores assessed at 2 years of age based on Bayley Scales of Infant Development (Second Edition). This model also helps to identify the exposure window of susceptibility.\nMaternal urinary levels of mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate (MEOHP) (\u03b2\u2009=\u20091.91, 95% CI: 0.43, 3.39), mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) (\u03b2\u2009=\u20091.56, 95% CI: 0.33, 2.79), and the sum of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (\u2211DEHP) (\u03b2\u2009=\u20091.85, 95% CI: 0.39, 3.31) during the first trimester showed the strongest and significant positive associations with intra-twin MDI difference. When stratified with twin chorionicity, the positive associations of monoethyl phthalate (MEP), monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), individual DEHP metabolites, and \u2211DEHP exposure during pregnancy with intra-twin neurodevelopmental differences were more significant in monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins than those in dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twins.\nNeurodevelopmental differences in MCDA twins were strongly associated with prenatal phthalate exposure. Our findings warrant further confirmation in longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "Digital Twin (DT) consists of a recent technology that can enable sustainability. However, Digital Twins are still in early stages of adoption, especially in households, and so the determinants to this adoption have not yet been determined. The aim of this study is to fill this research gap through providing a conceptual model of the drivers to the adoption of Digital Twins in households and it's relation to well-being. This study is developed as a mixed-methods research. The model is produced qualitatively, based on literature discoveries and key findings from interviews with experts and possible consumers. Afterwards, the model was validated with data collected through a questionnaire with 149 respondents. Results show that a set of informational, social, environmental and utility factors can influence the intention to adopt Digital Twins as a sustainable energy solution, and consequently the perceived well-being.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) have the potential to offer individualized evaluation of cardiac function in a non-invasive manner, making them a promising approach for personalized diagnosis and treatment planning of myocardial infarction (MI). The inference of accurate myocardial tissue properties is crucial in creating a reliable CDT of MI. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of inferring myocardial tissue properties from the electrocardiogram (ECG) within a CDT platform. The platform integrates multi-modal data, such as cardiac MRI and ECG, to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the inferred tissue properties. We perform a sensitivity analysis based on computer simulations, systematically exploring the effects of infarct location, size, degree of transmurality, and electrical activity alteration on the simulated QRS complex of ECG, to establish the limits of the approach. We subsequently present a novel deep computational model, comprising a dual-branch variational autoencoder and an inference model, to infer infarct location and distribution from the simulated QRS. The proposed model achieves mean Dice scores of 0.457 \u00b10.317 and 0.302 \u00b10.273 for the inference of left ventricle scars and border zone, respectively. The sensitivity analysis enhances our understanding of the complex relationship between infarct characteristics and electrophysiological features. The in silico experimental results show that the model can effectively capture the relationship for the inverse inference, with promising potential for clinical application in the future. The code is available at https://github.com/lileitech/MI_inverse_inference.",

    "abstract": "Congenital loss involves the loss of an immediate family member, specifically a parent or sibling, either during or prior to birth, and bears unique bereavement-related challenges. The current study investigated the unique congenital loss experiences of those who lost a twin sibling in utero. Through analysis of interviews with 18 Jewish Israeli participants who encountered this type of twin loss, a more comprehensive understanding of their experiences was attempted. The research employed a hybrid methodology, combining two qualitative thematic analysis methods: deductive and data-driven inductive approaches. The analysis revealed four themes: incoherency and uncertainty, ownership over a limited story, continuing an unborn bond, and the identity of a \"twin-less\" twin. The findings underscore the unique nature of twin loss in utero.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive decline and spinal pain (back pain [BP] and neck pain [NP]) represent a major public health challenge, yet the potential relationship between them remains elusive. A retrospective analysis of the Longitudinal Study of Ageing Danish Twins was performed to determine any potential relationships between BP/NP and cognitive function adjusting for age, sex, educational and socioeconomic status. A total of 4731 adults (2788 females/1943 males) aged 78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06 (SD) years were included in the analysis. We observed a 1-month prevalence of 25% with BP, 21% with NP and 11% for combined BP/NP. While there were no differences in cognition scores for males and females reporting combined BP/NP, compared to those without combined BP/NP (34.38 points [95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a031.88, 36.88] vs. 35.72 points [95% CI\u00a0=\u00a035.19, 36.26]; P\u00a0=\u00a00.180; and 35.72 points [95% CI\u00a0=\u00a035.19, 36.26] vs. 35.85 points [95% CI\u00a0=\u00a035.39, 36.31]; P\u00a0=\u00a00.327; for male and females, respectively), an adjusted analysis revealed that males with combined BP/NP presented with lower cognitive scores compared to males without combined BP/NP (81.26 points [95% CI\u00a0=\u00a073.80, 88.72] vs. 79.48 points [95% CI\u00a0=\u00a070.31, 88.66]; P\u00a0=\u00a00.043). The findings of this hypothesis-generating study may highlight a potential sex-specific association between spinal pain and later-life neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Medical digital twins are computational models of human biology relevant to a given medical condition, which are tailored to an individual patient, thereby predicting the course of disease and individualized treatments, an important goal of personalized medicine. The immune system, which has a central role in many diseases, is highly heterogeneous between individuals, and thus poses a major challenge for this technology. In February 2023, an international group of experts convened for two days to discuss these challenges related to immune digital twins. The group consisted of clinicians, immunologists, biologists, and mathematical modelers, representative of the interdisciplinary nature of medical digital twin development. A video recording of the entire event is available. This paper presents a synopsis of the discussions, brief descriptions of ongoing digital twin projects at different stages of progress. It also proposes a 5-year action plan for further developing this technology. The main recommendations are to identify and pursue a small number of promising use cases, to develop stimulation-specific assays of immune function in a clinical setting, and to develop a database of existing computational immune models, as well as advanced modeling technology and infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "This study reports the bilateral association of Peters' anomaly and congenital aniridia in monozygotic twins subsequently diagnosed with Wilms tumour (WAGR syndrome).\nTwo monozygotic female twins were referred at age 2\u2009months with bilateral corneal opacity. A diagnosis of Peters' anomaly associated to aniridia was made in both eyes of both twins. Physical examination and ultrasonography were carried out at 12\u2009months of age to explore the possibility of WAGR-related anomalies, specifically Wilms tumour. DNA were isolated and subjected to whole exome sequencing.\nPeters' anomaly associated to aniridia in both eyes as well as bilateral Wilms tumour in both children were diagnosed. Exome analyses showed a large heterozygous deletion encompassing 6\u2009648\u2009473\u2009bp in chromosome 11p13, using Integrative Genomics Viewer and AnnotSV software.\nWAGR syndrome is a rare contiguous gene deletion syndrome with a greater risk of developing Wilms tumour associated with Peters' anomaly and congenital aniridia. However, co-occurrence of both anomalies was rarely reported in twins, and never in both eyes of monozygotic twins. Here, we report the bilateral association of Peters' anomaly and congenital aniridia in monozygotic twins with WAGR syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The condition of monozygotic, monochorionic triplet fetuses with a pair of conjoined twins is extremely rare (close to one in a million births), presents challenges in its management, and with poor prognosis.\nWe report a case of monochorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy, ultrasound at 14\u2009weeks shows a pair of conjoined thoracopagus fetuses, sharing heart, liver, and umbilical cord, in addition to omphalocele. The third fetus, without malformations, presents signs of early heart failure compatible with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. It was decided to carry out expectant management where at 18\u2009weeks, intrauterine death of the three fetuses occurs. An abortion is performed by hysterotomy.\nThe treatment in these cases is discussed, three management options have been proposed: expectant management, selective reduction of the conjoined fetuses, or termination of the pregnancy. A review of the literature found only 12 cases with this combination of pathologies, in which only 3 normal fetuses (25%) survived and none of the conjoined twins survived. To our knowledge, this case is the first of a monochorionic triplet pregnancy with conjoined fetuses complicated with early twin-to-twin transfusion.",

    "abstract": "Fentanyl transdermal patches are widely implemented for cancer-induced pain treatment due to the high potency of fentanyl and gradual drug release. However, transdermal fentanyl up-titration for opioid-na\u00efve patients is difficult, which is why opioid treatment is often started with oral/iv morphine. Based on the daily dose of morphine, the initial dose of the fentanyl patch is decided upon. After reaching a stable level of pain, the switch is made from oral/iv morphine to transdermal fentanyl. There are standard calculation tools for transferring from oral/iv morphine to transdermal fentanyl, which is the same for all patients. By considering the variations in the physiology of the patients, a unique switching strategy cannot meet the needs of different patients. This study explores the outcome in terms of pain relief and minute ventilation during opioid therapy. For this, we used physics-based simulations on a virtually-generated population of patients, and we applied the same therapy to all patients. We could show that patients' physiology, such as gender, age, and weight, greatly impact the outcome of the therapy; as such, the correlation coefficient between pain intensity and age is 0.89, and the correlation coefficient between patient's weight and maximum plasma concentration of morphine and fentanyl is -0.98 and -0.97. Additionally, a different combination of the duration of overlap between morphine and fentanyl therapy with different doses of fentanyl was considered for the virtual patients to find the best opioid-switching strategy for each patient. We explored the impact of combining physiological features to determine the best-suited strategy for virtual patients. Our findings suggest that tailoring morphine and fentanyl therapy only based on a limited number of features is insufficient, and increasing the number of impactful physiological features positively influences the outcome of the therapy.",

    "abstract": "Infantile hemangioma is one of the most common benign soft tissue tumors in infants. The pathogenesis of infantile hemangioma remains unclear and twin studies regarding its incidence may help clarify disease pathogenesis. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of infantile hemangioma in twin patients and discuss its clinical incidence.\nWe retrospectively analyzed the data of 83 pairs of twins with infantile hemangioma admitted to the Guangdong Provincial Women and Children Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital between May 2016 and May 2022. Thirty-one pairs of twins among whom both developed infantile hemangioma and 52 pairs of twins among whom only one twin was affected were included. Analysis was performed using the Spearman correlation. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of factors such as sex, twin zygosity, preterm birth, birth weight, and assisted reproduction on the clinical characteristics of twins.\nWe observed that disease occurrence in both twins correlated with assisted reproduction (\u03c72\u2009=\u200913. 102, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and preterm birth (\u03c72\u2009=\u200936.523, P\u2009<\u20090.05). Twin zygosity (\u03c72\u2009=\u20090.716, P\u2009>\u20090.05) and total birth weight of twins (t=-3.369, P\u2009>\u20090.05) were not correlated with infantile hemangioma. However, among twins, the ones with lesser birth weight were more likely to develop infantile hemangioma.\nThe clinical characteristics of infantile hemangioma in twins were consistent with their epidemiological characteristics. Female sex, preterm birth, less birth weight, and assisted reproduction increased the probability of morbidity in both twins. Analysis of the characteristics of infantile hemangioma in twins may assist further research and clinical treatment.",

    "abstract": "Our retrospective study aimed to investigate whether parents of twins encounter heightened psychological and emotional distress one year after childbirth, in comparison to parents of singletons within an Italian cohort.\nExclusion criteria included multiparity, preterm birth, congenital anomalies, stillbirth, >2 fetus pregnancies, and pre-existing maternal mental health disorders. Out of the 300 couples (600 parents) invited to participate, 286 parents (158 mothers, 128 fathers) successfully completed a self-administered survey. We analyzed three scores separately for mothers and fathers, differentiating between singleton and twin pregnancies: the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score, the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-Y1 score, and the STAI-Y2 score.\nLogistic models were used to assess the influence of age, BMI, marital status, education, and employment on the three binary scores (EPDS, STAI-Y1, and STAI-Y2), revealing no significant differences in absolute scores between parents of singletons and twins. Paired analysis revealed significantly higher EPDS (mean increase: 3.8, SD: 6.5), STAI-Y1 (mean increase: 5.4, SD: 12.5), and STAI-Y2 (mean increase: 4.5, SD: 12.4) scores for mothers (p < 0.0001). Approximately 10% of women and 8% of men reported suicidal thoughts.\nContrary to expectations, no substantial psychological differences emerged between parents of twins and singletons. Adjusting for confounders through univariate analysis maintained nonsignificant trends. Nevertheless, caution in interpretation is warranted due to strict inclusion criteria favoring twin pregnancies with better outcomes. Unintended bias could have resulted from routine psychological support offered to mothers of twins in our clinic. This presents an important framework for future research, including randomized controlled trials comparing parents of multiples with psychological support to those without.Finally, the elevated prevalence of depression symptoms and suicidal thoughts in our cohort underscores the importance of mental health during pregnancy and early parenting. We advocate for the screening of parents for postpartum depression and various psychological conditions, encompassing a spectrum of anxiety disorders. Those at elevated risk of mental distress should be proactively offered appropriate support.",

    "abstract": "A digital twin is a virtual representation of a patient's disease, facilitating real-time monitoring, analysis, and simulation. This enables the prediction of disease progression, optimization of care delivery, and improvement of outcomes.\nHere, we introduce a digital twin framework for type 2 diabetes (T2D) that integrates machine learning with multiomic data, knowledge graphs, and mechanistic models. By analyzing a substantial multiomic and clinical dataset, we constructed predictive machine learning models to forecast disease progression. Furthermore, knowledge graphs were employed to elucidate and contextualize multiomic-disease relationships.\nOur findings not only reaffirm known targetable disease components but also spotlight novel ones, unveiled through this integrated approach. The versatile components presented in this study can be incorporated into a digital twin system, enhancing our grasp of diseases and propelling the advancement of precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of perinatal studies is complicated by twins and other multiple births even when they are not the exposure, outcome, or a confounder of interest. Common approaches to handling multiples in studies of infant outcomes include restriction to singletons, counting outcomes at the pregnancy-level (i.e., by counting if at least one twin experienced a binary outcome), or infant-level analysis including all infants and, typically, accounting for clustering of outcomes by using generalised estimating equations or mixed effects models. Several healthcare administration databases only support restriction to singletons or pregnancy-level approaches. For example, in MarketScan insurance claims data, diagnoses in twins are often assigned to a single infant identifier, thereby preventing ascertainment of infant-level outcomes among multiples. Different approaches correspond to different causal questions, produce different estimands, and often rely on different assumptions. We demonstrate the differences that can arise from these different approaches using Monte Carlo simulations, algebraic formulas, and an applied example. Furthermore, we provide guidance on the handling of multiples in perinatal studies when using healthcare administration data.",

    "abstract": "The industry is currently undergoing a digital revolution driven by the integration of several enabling technologies. These include automation, robotics, cloud computing, industrial cybersecurity, systems integration, digital twins, etc. Of particular note is the increasing use of digital twins, which offer significant added value by providing realistic and fully functional process simulations. This paper proposes an approach for developing digital twins in industrial environments. The novelty lies in not only focusing on obtaining the model of the industrial system and integrating virtual reality and/or augmented reality but also in emphasizing the importance of incorporating other enabled technologies of Industry 4.0, such as system integration, connectivity with standard and specific industrial protocols, cloud services, or new industrial automation systems, to enhance the capabilities of the digital twin. Furthermore, a proposal of the software tools that can be used to achieve this incorporation is made. Unity is chosen as the real-time 3D development tool for its cross-platform capability and streamlined industrial system modeling. The integration of augmented reality is facilitated by the Vuforia SDK. Node-RED is selected as the system integration option, and communications are carried out with MQTT protocol. Finally, cloud-based services are recommended for effective data storage and processing. Furthermore, this approach has been used to develop a digital twin of a robotic electro-pneumatic cell.",

    "abstract": "Fourteen pairs of twins were selected on the basis of their high scores on The Exceptional Experiences Questionnaire (EEQ), which documents the frequency and intensity of telepathic and synchronistic experiences amongst twins. The twins alternated in the role of sender in which they were exposed to a surprise or shock stimulus and in the role of receiver in which their electrodermal activity (EDA) was monitored. Sender and receiver were placed in laboratory rooms at remote ends of a building separated by distance and barriers ensuring sensory isolation. Twins in the role of sender were presented with a series of surprise or shock stimuli during the period randomly selected for presentation. This was one out of the 8 periods occurring in the block of 5 min. Within the selected period, the actual presentation lasted 30 s and occurred at approximately the midpoint of the period. The stimulus presentation in this block of 5 min was repeated 5 times making thereby a 25-minute session for each twin belonging to the sender-receiver pair. During this session, the other twin in the role of receiver, had been equipped with electrodes recording EDA and otherwise advised to relax during the session. The task for the judge in the studies was to use the electrophysiological data from the non-shocked twin to identify the exact periods when the stimuli had been exposed to the sending twin. The EDA from 91 useable presentations were displayed and analysed for the purpose of locating any peak EDA response in each of the possible eight periods corresponding to the stimuli exposure times. Correct identifications would thus occur by chance one in eight times. The attempts at these identifications were carried out by GB, a researcher experienced at EDA interpretation but blind as to the periods that had been chosen for the stimulus exposure. The findings from the three experimental studies showed there were 18 correct identifications out of the total 91 stimulus exposures (MCE = 11.4), which reached statistical significance on a one-tailed t-test (p = 0.043), and with a binomial test (p = .03, one-tailed). However, only one of the three studies reached significance, in this case at the same level as the collective results (p = 0.043, one-tailed). Two explanations for this are the observed variability in the task-performances of the pairs of twins and in the differences in the sources of the twins for each of the studies. The results of a questionnaire entitled 'Experiences in Close Relationships' (ECR), adapted for twin relationships to assess their degree of attachment, indicated that those twins with many \"correct identifications of epochs from the EDA\" were not significantly different from the others on this measure of attachment. However, it should be noted that the twins here according to the ECR all had close emotional relationships to each other, thereby giving too little variation to adequately test the hypotheses concerning the role of attachment. The data provides justification for carrying out further studies using this methodology and furthermore that pairs of twins should be used with greater variation in attachment measures. The results are briefly discussed in the context of recent findings concerning the neuropsychology of experiences of synchronicity.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to explore the maternal and perinatal risks in cases of monozygotic twins (MZT) following frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET).\nAll twin births that were conceived following FET from 2007 to 2021 at Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital in Shanghai, China were retrospectively reviewed. The exposure variable was twin type (monozygotic and dizygotic). The primary outcome was the incidence of neonatal death while secondary outcomes included hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, placenta previa, placental abruption, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, Cesarean delivery, gestational age, birth weight, weight discordance, stillbirth, birth defects, pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, and neonatal jaundice. Analysis of the outcomes was performed using logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The causal mediation analysis was conducted. A doubly robust estimation model was used to validate the results. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival probability. The sensitivity analysis was performed with a propensity score-based patient-matching model.\nOf 6101 dizygotic twin (DZT) and 164 MZT births conceived by FET, MZT showed an increased risk of neonatal death based on the multivariate logistic regression models (partially adjusted OR: 4.19; 95% CI, 1.23-10.8; fully adjusted OR: 4.95; 95% CI, 1.41-13.2). Similar results were obtained with the doubly robust estimation. Comparing MZT with DZT, the neonatal survival probability was lower for MZT (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The results were robust in the sensitivity analysis. Females with MZT pregnancies exhibited an elevated risk of preterm premature rupture of the membranes (adjusted OR: 2.42; 95% CI, 1.54-3.70). MZT were also associated with higher odds of preterm birth (prior to 37 weeks) (adjusted OR: 2.31; 95% CI, 1.48-3.67), low birth weight (adjusted OR: 1.92; 95% CI, 1.27-2.93), and small for gestational age (adjusted OR: 2.18; 95% CI, 1.21-3.69) in the fully adjusted analyses. The effect of MZT on neonatal death was partially mediated by preterm birth and low birth weight (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nThis study indicates that MZT conceived by FET are related to an increased risk of neonatal death, emphasizing a potential need for comprehensive antenatal surveillance in these at-risk pregnancies.",

    "results": "Of 6101 dizygotic twin (DZT) and 164 MZT births conceived by FET, MZT showed an increased risk of neonatal death based on the multivariate logistic regression models (partially adjusted OR: 4.19; 95% CI, 1.23-10.8; fully adjusted OR: 4.95; 95% CI, 1.41-13.2). Similar results were obtained with the doubly robust estimation. Comparing MZT with DZT, the neonatal survival probability was lower for MZT (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The results were robust in the sensitivity analysis. Females with MZT pregnancies exhibited an elevated risk of preterm premature rupture of the membranes (adjusted OR: 2.42; 95% CI, 1.54-3.70). MZT were also associated with higher odds of preterm birth (prior to 37 weeks) (adjusted OR: 2.31; 95% CI, 1.48-3.67), low birth weight (adjusted OR: 1.92; 95% CI, 1.27-2.93), and small for gestational age (adjusted OR: 2.18; 95% CI, 1.21-3.69) in the fully adjusted analyses. The effect of MZT on neonatal death was partially mediated by preterm birth and low birth weight (P\u2009<\u20090.05).",

    "abstract": "A 2\u00bd D point cloud registration method was developed to generate digital twins of different tissue shapes and resection cavities by applying a machine learning (ML) approach. This demonstrates the feasibility of quantifying soft tissue shifts.\nAn ML model was trained using simulated surface scan data obtained from tumor resections in a pig head cadaver model. It hereby uses 438 2\u00bd D scans of the tissue surface. Tissue shift was induced by a temperature change from 7.91 \u00b1 4.1\u00b0C to 36.37 \u00b1 1.28\u00b0C.\nDigital twins were generated from various branched and compact resection cavities (RCs) and cut tissues (CT). A temperature increase induced a tissue shift with a significant volume increase of 6 mL and 2 mL in branched and compact RCs, respectively (\nThe simulation experiment of induced soft tissue deformation using digital twins based on 2\u00bd D point cloud models proved that our method helps to quantify shape-dependent tissue shifts.",

    "abstract": "Migraine affects more than 1 billion people globally, with distinct genetic variations influencing susceptibility. Thereby, genetic variations play a key role in the probability of developing migraine. However, personalized genetic analysis-based treatment options in migraine treatments are limited. Notably, surgical deactivation of extracranial trigger has shown efficacy in the treatment of migraine patients with identifiable trigger points in specific anatomical locations in the head and neck region. We present the first case of monozygotic twin sisters, both experiencing occipital and temporal-triggered migraine headaches with identical history and characteristics and without response to conservative migraine treatments. After surgical intervention, targeting the greater and lesser occipital nerves as well as auriculotemporal nerves, both twin sisters exhibited an over 99% reduction in symptoms without postoperative complications. This case suggests a potential correlation between genetic background, irrespective of environmental factors, and the effectiveness of surgical deactivation of trigger points in migraine management.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is an established risk factor for hypertension, but the mechanisms are only partially understood. We examined whether body mass index (BMI)-related DNA methylation (DNAm) variation would mediate the association of BMI with blood pressure (BP). We first conducted a genomewide DNA methylation analysis in monozygotic twin pairs to detect BMI-related DNAm variation and then evaluated the mediating effect of DNAm on the relationship between BMI and BP levels using the causal inference test (CIT) method and mediation analysis. Ontology enrichment analysis was performed for CpGs using the GREAT tool. A total of 60 twin pairs for BMI and systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 58 twin pairs for BMI and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were included. BMI was positively associated with SBP (\u03b2 = 1.86, ",

    "abstract": "We report the case of twins diagnosed with chronic enteropathy associated with the SLCO2A1 gene (CEAS) based on characteristic ulcer findings, which required 8\u00a0years to diagnose. Both twins had similar symptoms, including anemia and growth failure but the gastrointestinal tract was not evaluated initially because of mild symptoms that were considered consistent with psychological etiology. The endoscopic findings of the firstborn child showed spiral ulcer scars and pseudodiverticulum formation without Helicobacter pylori infection or eosinophilic infiltration in the duodenum. Since the twins presented with ulcers of an unknown cause simultaneously and the first-born child had a spiral ulcer, CEAS was suspected. Genetic analysis and high levels of prostaglandin E major urinary metabolites in the urine led to a definitive diagnosis of CEAS.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent progress in adoptive T cell therapy for cancer, understanding and predicting the kinetics of infused T cells remains a challenge. Multiple factors can impact the distribution, expansion, and decay or persistence of infused T cells in patients. We have developed a novel quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model of TCR-transgenic T cell therapy in patients with solid tumors to describe the kinetics of endogenous T cells and multiple memory subsets of engineered T cells after infusion. These T cells undergo lymphodepletion, proliferation, trafficking, differentiation, and apoptosis in blood, lymph nodes, tumor site, and other peripheral tissues. Using the model, we generated patient-matched digital twins that recapitulate the circulating T cell kinetics reported from a clinical trial of TCR-engineered T cells targeting E7 in patients with metastatic HPV-associated epithelial cancers. Analyses of key parameters influencing cell kinetics and differences among digital twins identify stem cell-like memory T cells (T",

    "abstract": "With the development of assisted reproductive technology, the number of twin pregnancies is increasing year by year. Given the increased risk of pregnancy complications associated with twin pregnancies, and the fact that these babies are rare and difficult to obtain through assisted reproductive technology, clinicians urgently require finding effective and safe drugs to improve pregnancy outcomes. Low-dose aspirin can not only promote placental blood supply, but also effectively anti-inflammatory. Whether Low-dose aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of pregnancy complications in this special group needs to be clarified. We therefore retrospectively analyzed 665 twin pregnancies from assisted reproduction technology, grouped according to aspirin use, and followed pregnancy outcomes to assess bleeding risk. Low-dose aspirin was found to be effective in preventing preeclampsia without a significant risk of bleeding. However, aspirin does not prevent specific complication in twin pregnancies and seems to have a better preventive effect only when the mother is under 30, which should alarm clinicians should not blindly using aspirin in this particular group.",

    "abstract": "The use of Digital Twins (DTs) or the digital replicas of physical entities has provided benefits to several industry sectors, most notably manufacturing. To date, the application of DTs in the healthcare sector has been minimal, however. But, as pressure increases for more precise and personalized treatments, it behooves us to investigate the potential for DTs in the healthcare context. As a proof-of-concept demonstration prior to working with real patients, we attempt in this paper, to explore the potential for creating and using DTs. We do this in a synthetic environment at this stage, making use of data that is all computer-generated. DTs of synthetic present patients are created making use of data of synthetic past patients. In the real world, the clinical objective for creating such DTs of real patients would be to enable enhanced real-time clinical decision support to enable more precise and personalized care. The objective of the numerical experiment reported in this paper, is to envisage the possibilities and challenges of such an approach. We attempt to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of applying DTs in the healthcare context to support more precise and personalized treatments.",

History obtained from the owner and/or referring veterinarian detailed information regarding the mare (age, breed), pregnancy (day of gestation, dizygotic versus monozygotic twins, unilateral versus bilateral fixation), treatment and outcome (one live fetus at discharge; live singleton at foaling) after twin reduction. Transrectal fetal thorax compression was performed under ultrasound guidance by two experienced operators.\nOverall 9 of 16 twin pregnancies were successfully reduced and the likelihood of success was significantly higher in dizygotic than monozygotic twins. The procedure was successful in 9 of 10 dizygotic twins but unsuccessful in all six cases of monozygotic twins. Among the dizygotic twins, two mares lost the pregnancy after discharge from the clinic, seven mares delivered a healthy foal of normal size.\nSmall case number.\nTransrectal ultrasound-guided fetal thorax compression is a minimally-invasive and successful technique for reducing dizygotic twin pregnancies at approximately 2 months of gestation, but does not lead to any live births in cases of monozygotic twins.",

This report presents a unique case involving a pair of premature female twins who both developed vaginal wall prolapse without any neurological deficits. Multiple factors such as selective intrauterine growth restriction, feeding intolerance, extrauterine growth retardation, and elevated intra-abdominal pressure after birth may have contributed to the development of this phenomenon. Notably, the severity of prolapse was more pronounced in the twin with lower birth weight and smaller for gestational age. After a five-month follow-up period, the twins' prolapsed vaginal wall fully retracted due to a combination of conservative treatment and enhanced nutritional support.",

    "abstract": "Fetal brain extraction from magnetic resonance (MR) images is of great importance for both clinical applications and neuroscience studies. However, it is a challenging task, especially when dealing with twins, which are commonly existing in pregnancy. Currently, there is no brain extraction method dedicated to twins, raising significant demand to develop an effective twin fetal brain extraction method. To this end, we propose the first twin fetal brain extraction framework, which possesses three novel features. First, to narrow down the region of interest and preserve structural information between the two brains in twin fetal MR images, we take advantage of an advanced object detector to locate all the brains in twin fetal MR images at once. Second, we propose a Twin Fetal Brain Extraction Network (TFBE-Net) to further suppress insignificant features for segmenting brain regions. Finally, we propose a Two-step Training Strategy (TTS) to learn correlation features of the single fetal brain for further improving the performance of TFBE-Net. We validate the proposed framework on a twin fetal brain dataset. The experiments show that our framework achieves promising performance on both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods for fetal brain extraction.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins are considered the next step in IoT-based cyber-physical systems; they allow for the real-time monitoring of assets, and they provide a comprehensive understanding of a system behavior, allowing for data-driven insights and informed choices. However, no comprehensive framework exists for the development of IoT-based digital twins. Moreover, the existing frameworks do not consider the aspects introduced by the Industry 5.0 paradigm, such as sustainability, human-centricity, and resilience. This paper proposes a framework based on the one defined as the outcome of a project funded by the European Union between 2010 and 2013 called the IoT Architectural Reference Model (IoT-A or IoT-ARM), with the aim of the development and implementation of a standard IoT framework that includes digital twins. This framework establishes and implements a standardized collection of architectural instruments for modeling IoT systems in the 5.0 era, serving as a benchmark for the design and implementation of an IoT architecture focused on digital twins and enabling the sustainability, resilience, and human-centricity of the information system. Furthermore, a proof of concept of a monitoring digital twin for a vertical farming system has been developed to test the validity of the framework, and a discussion of applications in the manufacturing and service sectors is presented.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins are virtual models of physical artefacts that may or may not be synchronously connected, and that can be used to simulate their behavior. They are widely used in several domains such as manufacturing and automotive to enable achieving specific quality goals. In the health domain, so-called digital patient twins have been understood as virtual models of patients generated from population data and/or patient data, including, for example, real-time feedback from wearables. Along with the growing impact of data science technologies like artificial intelligence, novel health data ecosystems centered around digital patient twins could be developed. This paves the way for improved health monitoring and facilitation of personalized therapeutics based on management, analysis, and interpretation of medical data via digital patient twins. The utility and feasibility of digital patient twins in routine medical processes are still limited, despite practical endeavors to create digital twins of physiological functions, single organs, or holistic models. Moreover, reliable simulations for the prediction of individual drug responses are still missing. However, these simulations would be one important milestone for truly personalized therapeutics. Another prerequisite for this would be individualized pharmaceutical manufacturing with subsequent obstacles, such as low automation, scalability, and therefore high costs. Additionally, regulatory challenges must be met thus calling for more digitalization in this area. Therefore, this narrative mini-review provides a discussion on the potentials and limitations of digital patient twins, focusing on their potential bridging function for personalized therapeutics and an individualized pharmaceutical manufacturing while also looking at the regulatory impacts.",

    "abstract": "Existing evidence suggests that developmental prosopagnosia (DP) is a surprisingly prevalent condition, with some individuals describing lifelong difficulties with facial identity recognition. Together with case reports of multiple family members with the condition, this evidence suggests that DP is inherited in at least some instances. Here, we offer some novel case series that further support the heritability of the condition. First, we describe five adult siblings who presented to our lab with symptoms of DP. Second, for the first known time in the literature, we describe a pair of adult identical twins who contacted us in the belief that they both experience DP. The condition was confirmed in three of the five siblings (with minor symptoms observed in the remaining two) and in both twins. Supplementary assessments suggested that all individuals also experienced some degree of difficulty with facial identity perception, but that object recognition was preserved. These findings bolster the evidence supporting the heritability of DP and suggest that it can be a specific impairment in some cases.",

    "abstract": "Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a rare genetic syndrome associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and craniofacial dysmorphisms caused by variations in the TCF4 transition factor. The aim of this article was to report the case of two twin infants diagnosed with PTHS, confirmed by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the TCF4 gene through DNA extracted from a buccal swab.\nBoth infants presented with craniofacial asymmetry with a metopic crest and cranial deformity. During the diagnostic investigation, computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstruction of the skull showed premature fusion of the left coronal and metopic sutures in both twins. They underwent craniofacial reconstruction at the 9th month of age using a combination of techniques. The postoperative outcomes were satisfactory in both cases.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report to describe the occurrence of complex craniosynostosis (CCS) in children with PTHS. Further studies are needed to determine whether the co-occurrence of PTHS and CCS described here indicates an association or is explained by chance.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the STOPPIT-3 study is to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) prior to planned birth of twins in a multicentre placebo-controlled trial with internal pilot.\nThis study will comprise a multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in at least 50 UK obstetric units. The target population is 1552\u2009women with a twin pregnancy and a planned birth between 35 and 38+6 weeks' gestation recruited from antenatal clinics. Women will be randomised to Dexamethasone Phosphate (24\u2009mg) or saline administered via two intramuscular injections 24 hours apart, 24-120\u2009hours prior to scheduled birth.\nThe primary outcome is need for respiratory support within 72 hours of birth. Secondary and safety outcomes will be included. Cognitive and language development at age 2 years will be assessed in a subset of participants using the Parent report of Children's Abilities-Revised questionnaire. We will also determine the cost effectiveness of the treatment with ACS compared with placebo.\nSTOPPIT-3 has been funded and approved by the National Institute of Healthcare Research. It has been approved by the West Midlands Research Ethics Committee (22/WM/0018). The results will be disseminated via publication in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentation and will also be communicated to the public via links with charity partners and social media.\nThe University of Edinburgh and Lothian Health Board ACCORD, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ.\nISRCTN59959611.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins are virtual replicas of their physical counterparts, and can assist in delivering personalized surgical care. This PRISMA guideline-based systematic review evaluates current literature addressing the effectiveness and role of digital twins in many stages of neurosurgical management. The aim of this review is to provide a high-quality analysis of relevant, randomized controlled trials and observational studies addressing the neurosurgical applicability of a variety of digital twin technologies. Using pre-specified criteria, we evaluated 25 randomized controlled trials and observational studies on the applications of digital twins, including navigation, robotics, and image-guided neurosurgeries. All 25 studies compared these technologies against usual surgical approaches. Risk of bias analyses using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials (Rob 2) found \"low\" risk of bias in the majority of studies (23/25). Overall, this systematic review shows that digital twin applications have the potential to be more effective than conventional neurosurgical approaches when applied to brain and spinal surgery. Moreover, the application of these novel technologies may also lead to fewer post-operative complications.",

    "abstract": "Across multiple domains of science, engineering, and medicine, excitement is growing about the potential of digital twins to transform scientific research, industrial practices, and many aspects of daily life. A digital twin couples computational models with a physical counterpart to create a system that is dynamically updated through bidirectional data flows as conditions change. Going beyond traditional simulation and modeling, digital twins could enable improved medical decision-making at the individual patient level, predictions of future weather and climate conditions over longer timescales, and safer, more efficient engineering processes. However, many challenges remain before these applications can be realized. This report identifies the foundational research and resources needed to support the development of digital twin technologies. The report presents critical future research priorities and an interdisciplinary research agenda for the field, including how federal agencies and researchers across domains can best collaborate.",
