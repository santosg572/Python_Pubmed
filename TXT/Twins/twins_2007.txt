    "abstract": "Female monozygotic twins, both international endurance athletes aged 18 years, presented for a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan as part of a university clinical trial. Twin 1 had only menstruated twice since menarche; Twin 2 had not yet started menstruating. Both twins acknowledged suffering from disordered eating for approximately 3 years. Both twins presented with low lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) and normal total body, total hip, and femoral neck BMD.\nFemale athlete triad comprising disordered eating with insufficient energy availability, amenorrhea, and low age-related BMD.\nDespite some weight gain and reduction of athletic training and competition over a 5-year period, lumbar BMD remained low in both twins and was complicated by a rapid decline in BMD at the hips. Twin 2 remained amenorrheic. The oral contraceptive pill was not effective in maintaining BMD in the other twin. Contraindicated treatment with bisphosphonates was not tolerated and promptly ceased. This case seminar emphasizes the absence of a clear physician-coordinated multi-disciplinary treatment approach and the complexity in treating all the components of the triad in young athletes.\nfemale athlete triad; monozygotic; amenorrhea; bone mineral density.",

    "abstract": "The aims of the present study are to describe the secular trend of breast-feeding rates in Japanese twins in comparison with the general population, and then to clarify the maternal and infants' obstetric factors associated with breast-feeding in twins.\nBreast-feeding rates from 0 to 6 full months and related maternal and infant obstetric factors were analyzed using 4,023 Japanese twins, consisting of two different volunteer-based twin samples, age 1-15 years, whose birth year ranged from 1968 to 2003. Data were collected through mailed or hand-delivered questionnaires. Obstetric factors that affect full and partial breast-feeding of twins were confirmed using logistic analyses according to birth order in twin pairs, adjusted by birth year.\nThe full breast-feeding rates of twins were lower than those of the general population. On the other hand, the combined rates of full and partial breast-feeding were close to those of general population, except for the period 1968-1974. The percentage of concordance pares was around 95% for all months. The most influential factor that negatively correlated with breast-feeding from 0 to 6 months was gestational weeks. Higher maternal age at twin birth and the use of an incubator also prevented breast-feeding in the neonatal period.\nThe results of the present study for the first time indicated that full breast-feeding of twins has risen recently in Japan, although the rates are still lower than those of the general population. The importance of the gestational weeks for breast-feeding rates was also shown.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) remains a mystery. Some suspected risk factors include birth rank, maternal age, sex, family history and monozygosity in twins. Various theories attempt to explain the etiology of IHPS. Scientific research suggests that enteric neuronal damage and nitric oxide synthase dysfunction may be implicated, but the consensus is that environmental modification must exist to account for the variability in its occurrence.\nFour cases of concordant occurrences of IHPS in twins were examined to determine the history and outcome of IHPS development in twins. Three sets were dizygotic and one was monozygotic. Of the eight infants, three were female, including the one monozygotic pair. In all four cases, a time lag existed between the development of symptomatic onset of IHPS in twin A and twin B. In one set, sonographic confirmation, performed because of IHPS diagnosis in the twin sibling, occurred concurrently with onset of vomiting, leading to early surgery before fluid and electrolyte imbalances developed.\nDespite the lack of agreement as to whether the cause of IHPS is genetic, environmental or both, the high concordance rate seen in twins is indisputable. Thus, the empirical evidence provides credence to consider examining the asymptomatic co-twin when one of the twins presents with IHPS.\nL\u2019\u00e9tiologie de la st\u00e9nose hypertrophique du pylore chez l\u2019enfant (SHPE) demeure un myst\u00e8re. Parmi les facteurs de risque pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s, soulignons le rang dans la famille, l\u2019\u00e2ge de la m\u00e8re, le sexe, les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents familiaux et le monozygotisme chez les jumeaux. Diverses th\u00e9ories cherchent \u00e0 expliquer l\u2019\u00e9tiologie de la SHPE. Selon les recherches scientifiques, les l\u00e9sions neuronales ent\u00e9riques et le dysfonctionnement de la synthase de monoxyde d\u2019azote pourraient \u00eatre en cause, mais on s\u2019entend pour croire en une modification environnementale qui en expliquerait la variabilit\u00e9.\nLes auteurs ont examin\u00e9 quatre cas d\u2019occurrences concomitantes de SHPE chez des jumeaux pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019historique et l\u2019issue de l\u2019\u00e9volution du SHPE chez les jumeaux. Trois couples \u00e9taient dizygotes et un, monozygote. Trois des huit nourrissons \u00e9taient de sexe f\u00e9minin, y compris le couple monozygote. Dans les quatre cas, on remarquait un d\u00e9lai entre l\u2019apparition symptomatique du SHPE chez le jumeau A et le jumeau B. Au sein d\u2019un couple, la confirmation \u00e9chographique effectu\u00e9e en raison du diagnostic de SHPE chez le jumeau a concord\u00e9 avec le d\u00e9but des vomissements et suscit\u00e9 une intervention chirurgicale rapide, avant l\u2019apparition d\u2019un d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre de liquides et d\u2019\u00e9lectrolytes.\nM\u00eame si on ne s\u2019entend pas pour d\u00e9terminer si le SHPE est attribuable \u00e0 des facteurs g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques, environnementaux ou les deux, le taux de concordance \u00e9lev\u00e9 observ\u00e9 chez les jumeaux est incontestable. De plus, les donn\u00e9es empiriques justifient l\u2019examen du jumeau asymptomatique lorsque l\u2019autre jumeau est atteint de SHPE.",

    "abstract": "Four-year-old monozygotic female twins with early onset Tay-Sachs disease are described. The sisters showed similar slowly progressive clinical symptoms and deterioration, however the younger sister also demonstrated intractable myoclonus in the right leg. The serial MR images and (1)H-MR spectroscopy of the brain were obtained in both twins. MR images showed high intensity on T (2)-weighted image in the bilateral white matter, however there were no signal changes in the basal ganglia and thalamus during any of the phases. The ratio of N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) was decreased in the both white matter lesions and the corpus striatum, and that of myoinositol (mI)/Cr was increased in the damaged white matter on MR spectroscopy. The elevation of the lactate peak was clearly demonstrated in the left basal ganglia of the younger sister; however it was not shown in cerebral lesions of the elder sister. Changes in metabolites on MR spectroscopy were closely linked to the respective clinical features of each twin. Follow-up examination by (1)H-MR spectroscopy is useful for the evaluation of neuronal changes in children with Tay-Sachs disease.",

    "abstract": "Posterior urethral valves (PUVs), the most common congenital cause of lower urinary tract obstruction, have been described to occur in identical and nonidentical twins. Until now, reports have been published on 15 cases of PUVs.\nWe report a new case of concordant PUVs in one set of male monochorionic twins with secondary Prune Belly Syndrome.\nThe twins were born by elective cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation to a 36-year-old mother, gravida 6, para 6. On ultrasound perfomed at 18 weeks's gestation, both fetuses showed signs of PUVs. At birth, physical examination of both revealed a secondary Prune Belly Syndrome (PBS). Postnatal renal ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of PUV. The two infants underwent transurethral resection of the valves after a cystoscopic evaluation of the urethra. Since this procedure, their voiding has been unremarkable with stable renal function and sterile urine until their discharge.\nWe have documented a rare association between VUP and PBS in two monochiorionic twins. More studies are needed to throw light on the significance of the present associated anomalies.",

Both twins (HDH, DHH) had agenesis of ten and eleven teeth (respectively), third molars excluded, consistent with oligodontia and both had four impacted primary teeth and the permanent successors of all these primary teeth were congenitally missing. The occurrence of similarly located tooth agenesis and primary impacted teeth in monozygotic twins may suggest the influence of genetic factors in their etiology. In addition, primary tooth impaction may be related to congenitally missing tooth.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents investigations into the ability of speaker verification technology to discriminate between identical twins. It is shown that whilst, in general, the genetic and non-genetic characteristics of voice are both of value to speaker verification capabilities, it is the latter which is highly beneficial in the separation of the speech of identical twins. It is further demonstrated that through the use of unconstrained cohort normalisation as a complementary means for the exploitation of such voice characteristics, the verification reliability can be considerably enhanced for both identical twins and unrelated speakers. Experiments were conducted using a bespoke clean-speech database consisting of utterances from 49 identical twin pairs. The paper details the problem in speaker verification posed by identical twins, discusses the experimental investigations and provides an analysis of the results.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations in the donor and the recipient in monochorionic twin pregnancies with twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and single pregnancies in order to investigate the involvement of VEGF in the pathophysiology of TTTS.\nSix twin pregnancies in 11 monochorionic twin pregnancies complicated with TTTS and 11 single control pregnancies were compared. Gestational age-matched fetal blood and placental samples were obtained at birth. Serum VEGF concentration in the umbilical vein was measured by an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay. Tissue protein expression of VEGF was determined by using immunohistochemistry. Western blot analysis and scanning densitometry were used to quantify and compare the VEGF expression in the terminal villi.\nSerum VEGF concentrations in the umbilical vein in both donors and recipients tended to be higher than those in the controls. Immunolocalization of VEGF in terminal villous placenta samples in both donors and recipients was mainly observed in the syncytiotrophoblastic layer and vascular endothelial cells with less intense staining in stromal cells. The expression of VEGF in the donor placenta increased significantly (p=0.006) compared to that in the control placenta, but the expression of VEGF in the recipients tended to be higher than in the controls.\nIntrauterine circulatory imbalance may induce changes in VEGF expression and these alterations may be involved in both donor and recipient in the pathogenesis of TTTS, due to the maintenance of hemodynamic stability between the circulation of the twins.",

Immunolocalization of VEGF in terminal villous placenta samples in both donors and recipients was mainly observed in the syncytiotrophoblastic layer and vascular endothelial cells with less intense staining in stromal cells. The expression of VEGF in the donor placenta increased significantly (p=0.006) compared to that in the control placenta, but the expression of VEGF in the recipients tended to be higher than in the controls.",

A sibling, especially a twin of an affected patient, should be suspected of having a similar problem, even if he or she is asymptomatic. Genetic factors probably play an important etiological role in the co-occurence of partial anodontia and supernumerary teeth.",

    "abstract": "Infant leukemia associated with rearrangement of the MLL gene typically presents with high-risk clinical features. Relapse is common despite aggressive therapy and perturbations in signaling pathways may contribute to disease resistance. We evaluated twin 4-month-old monozygotic baby boys who presented with MLL-rearranged precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Two different MLL/AF4 variants were found in both the twins, the first involving MLL intron 8 and AF4 intron 3 and the second stemming from translocations of MLL exon 10 and AF4 exon 4. We detected expression of the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms, Ik1, Ikx+, Ik2 and the dominant-negative Ik4 Ikaros isoform in both patients. However, the dominant-negative Ik8 isoform was detected in only 1 boy, suggesting a common genetic ontogeny that was modulated by leukemic evolution. Further exploration of Ikaros expression in the background of MLL rearrangements may provide new insights into disease pathogenesis and could offer targets for novel chemotherapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has indicated that friends' drinking may influence alcohol use in adolescents and young adults. We explored whether similarities in the drinking behavior of friends of twins influence the genetic architecture of alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. Survey data from The Netherlands Twin Register were available for 1,526 twin pairs aged 16-25 years. We categorized the twin pairs as concordant (both report similar alcohol use in their friends) or discordant for the alcohol use of their friends. Genetic moderator models were tested by carrying out multi-group analyzes in Mplus. Findings showed a significant moderation effect. Genetic factors were more and common environment less important in the explanation of variation in alcohol use in twins discordant for alcohol use of friends than in twins concordant for alcohol use of friends.",

    "abstract": "We have shown previously that treadmill exercise within lower body negative pressure (LBNPex) maintains upright exercise capacity (peak oxygen consumption, Vo(2peak)) in men after 5, 15, and 30 days of bed rest (BR). We hypothesized that LBNPex protects treadmill Vo(2peak) and sprint speed in women during a 30-day BR. Seven sets of female monozygous twins volunteered to participate. Within each twin set, one was randomly assigned to a control group (Con) and performed no countermeasures, and the other was assigned to an exercise group (Ex) and performed a 40-min interval (40-80% pre-BR Vo(2peak)) LBNPex (51 +/- 5 mmHg) protocol, plus 5 min of static LBNP, 6 days per week. Before and immediately after BR, subjects completed a 30.5-m sprint test and an upright graded treadmill test to volitional fatigue. These results in women were compared with previously reported reductions in Vo(2peak) and sprint speed in male twins after BR. In women, sprint speed (-8 +/- 2%) and Vo(2peak) (-6 +/- 2%) were not different after BR in the Ex group. In contrast, both sprint speed (-24 +/- 5%) and Vo(2peak) (-16 +/- 3%) were significantly less after BR in the Con group. The effect of BR on sprint speed and Vo(2peak) after BR was not different between women and men. We conclude that treadmill exercise within LBNP protects against BR-induced reductions in Vo(2peak) and sprint speed in women and should prove effective during long-duration spaceflight.",

    "abstract": "Circulating adiponectin is emerging as an important link between obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the spectrum of lifestyle factors that modulate the adiponectin concentration remains to be elucidated, particularly among women. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 877 female twin pairs from the TwinsUK adult twin registry. Using a co-twin design, we examined dietary and body composition influences on adiponectin by conducting matched, within-pair analyses to eliminate confounding. Following multivariable adjustment within-twin pairs, significant influences on adiponectin (log-transformed, percent change per SD of the dietary/body composition variable) were observed for nonstarch polysaccharides (3.25%; 95% CI: 0.06, 6.54; P < 0.05) and magnesium intake (3.80%; 95%CI: 0.17, 7.57; P < 0.05), with a trend toward an association for fruit and vegetable (F&V) intakes (2.55%; 95% CI: -0.26, 5.45; P = 0.08). These modest positive associations cannot be explained by confounding through other lifestyle factors shared by the twins. A significant relationship between adiponectin and 3 derived dietary patterns (F&V, dieting, traditional English), carbohydrate, protein, trans fat, and alcohol intake was also observed. Strong inverse associations with adiponectin were observed for BMI (-10.72%; 95% CI: -13.78, -7.55), total (-6.89%: 95% CI: -10.34, -3.30; P < 0.05), and central fat mass (-12.50%; 95% CI: -15.82, -9.05; P < 0.05); these relationships were significant both when twins were analyzed as individuals and when characteristics were contrasted within-twin pairs, suggesting a direct effect. We observed modest associations between dietary factors and adiponectin in female twins, independent of adiposity, and report strong inverse associations with body composition. These data reinforce the importance of weight maintenance and increasing consumption of diets rich in plant-based foods to prevent CVD and type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of tethered cord syndrome (TCS) without typical conus medullaris symptoms and the radiological features such as a low set conus medullaris or dysraphic malformation is difficult. We report 11 year old identical twin brothers with TCS associated with the conus at the normal level. Their presenting symptom was progressive leg pain and both patients underwent surgical interruption of the filum terminale. The pain recurred in one patient treated surgically only after symptom became worse but resolved immediately in the other sibling treated promptly. We indicate the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of TCS to obtain excellent long-term outcome despite the absence of a low set conus or specific symptoms. Furthermore, when a twin or sibling of an affected person has neurological symptoms and the cutaneous signature of spinal dysraphism, radiological examination should be performed to establish the cause.",

    "abstract": "A unique situation of twins with similar sagittal synostosis pathology who underwent different surgical corrective procedures allowed us an opportunity to compare an endoscopic technique to the more traditional technique of a modified cranial vault remodeling (CVR). At 4 months of age, 1 twin underwent an endoscopic-assisted extended strip craniectomy with postoperative helmet therapy for 12 months, and the other underwent a reverse pi CVR procedure. Cephalic index, the Whitaker Aesthetic score, and developmental tests were used for comparison during a 6-year follow-up. The modified CVR had a superior outcome compared to the endoscopic procedure with regard to cephalic index measurements (CVR = 77; endoscopic = 63; P < 0.05) and the Whitaker score (CVR = 1 or no revisions necessary; endoscopic = 2.3 or minor to major bony work required for correction). Patients had similar intelligence quotient test scores; however, the endoscopic patient had lower scores in both preschool tests and global evaluations compared with the normal scores of the CVR patient. The modified CVR procedure was superior to the endoscopic procedure, at least in these twins with sagittal synostosis.",

Cardiac manifestations may include left ventricular wall thickening and both systolic and diastolic dysfunctions. We describe a group of family members, including a pair of identical twins, each of whom suffered from thalassaemia major requiring multiple transfusions. Cardiac magnetic resonance demonstrated myocardial iron overload, and impairment of systolic function. Echocardiography confirmed both significant left ventricular systolic and diastolic impairment, along with features consistent with left ventricular non-compaction. This finding has not been noted in association with thalassaemia-related cardiac disease before. We then review the cardiac manifestations which occur in association with thalassaemia major.",

The cohorts were followed from baseline through 2002 (Sweden) and through 2004 (Finland).\nWe found a risk increase of myeloma with a relative risk (RR) of 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-3.7) among obese persons, a RR of 2.5 (1.0-6.2) for chronic myeloid leukaemia and a RR of 2.7 (0.8-9.6) for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia among overweight persons as compared to normal-weighted ones.\nOur results add further evidence suggesting that overweight and obesity may have an impact on some haematological malignancies, in particular myeloma.",

    "abstract": "We examined the genetic architecture of a Tower of London test of planning and problem-solving in 690 middle-aged male twins. Phenotypic analyses revealed only one general factor, but the best-fitting genetic model indicated two correlated genetic factors: speed and efficiency. One variable-number of attempts required to mentally figure the puzzles-loaded on both factors. Shared environmental effects could be dropped with virtually no reduction in model fit. Despite significant nonshared environmental correlations across measures, there was no discernable nonshared environmental factor structure. The correlation between genetic factors (r = 0.46) and the variable loading on both factors could reflect modulation of planning, testing alternatives, and working memory that are required to perform the test. Such coordinated activity is consistent with the notion of a supervisory attentional system, a central executive, or metacognitive ability. The different phenotypic and genetic factor results suggest that relying solely on the former could obscure genetic associations.",

    "abstract": "The primary aim was to review the graft and patient survival of all recipients of a living identical twin donor renal transplant in the United States and United Kingdom, between 1988 and 2004. The secondary aim was to assess their maintenance immunosuppression.\nData of all the patients who underwent living identical twin donor renal transplantation in the United States and United Kingdom during 1988-2004 were retrieved from United Network for Organ Sharing and UK transplant, respectively. Further data were retrieved by sending letters to the individual transplant units in the United Kingdom.\nThere were 120 living identical twin donor renal transplants in the United States and 12 in the United Kingdom during the study period. Graft survival was 99.17%, 91.84%, and 88.96% in the US group at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, and 83.3%, 83.3%, and 75% in the UK group during the same follow-up period. Patient survival was 100%, 97.01%, and 97.01% in the US group at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, and 100% in the UK group during the same 5-year follow-up period. A large number of patients were on some form of immunosuppression.\nGraft and patient survival were good in both countries. These results are better than those published in the literature over the previous 20 years. Although phenotypic differences in monozygotic twins can exist, immunosuppression may be unnecessary in all these patients. Ideally, all identical twins who are currently on immunosuppression should undergo zygosity testing to establish whether they should continue the immunosuppression unless they need it for another reason.",

    "abstract": "To examine the extent to which a common genetic pathway is also involved in the relationship between depressive symptoms, in the absence of major depressive disorder (MDD), and inflammation. Recent data suggested that MDD and inflammation share common genes.\nWe recruited 188 male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry who were free of symptomatic coronary artery disease and MDD, with mean +/- standard deviation (SD) age of 55 +/- 2.75 years, including 54 monozygotic and 40 dizygotic twin pairs. These pairs were assessed for two inflammatory markers, interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP). Current depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the phenotypic association between depression and inflammatory markers. Biometrical genetic modeling was performed to estimate the genetic and environmental contributions to this association.\nAn association was observed between severity of current depressive symptoms and increased levels of inflammatory markers (p < .001 for IL-6 and p = .005 for CRP). After adjustment for other factors, the association was slightly attenuated but remained statistically significant for IL-6 (p = .002). The heritability of IL-6, CRP, and depressive symptoms were estimated as 0.37, 0.65, and 0.48, respectively. Genetic modeling found a significant genetic correlation between IL-6 and depressive symptoms (r(G) = 0.22, p = .046), indicating that about 66% of the covariance between them can be explained by shared genetic influences.\nCurrent depressive symptoms are significantly correlated with inflammatory markers. This covariation is due, in large part, to genes that are common to depressive symptoms and inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate quantitative sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) frequencies in monozygotic twins discordant for chronic fatigue syndrome.\nThirteen pairs of female twins underwent polysomnography. During the first night, they adapted to the sleep laboratory, and during the second night, their baseline sleep was assessed. Visual stage scoring was conducted on sleep electroencephalographic records according to standard criteria, and power spectral analysis was used to quantify delta through beta frequency bands, processed in 6-s blocks. Data were averaged across sleep stage within each twin and coded for sleep stage and the presence or absence of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). A completely within-subjects repeated measure multivariate analysis of variance evaluated twin pairs by frequency band by sleep stage interactions and simple effects. The relationship between alpha and delta EEG was also assessed across twin pairs.\nNo significant differences in spectral power in any frequency band were found between those with CFS and their nonfatigued cotwins. Phasic alpha activity, coupled with delta was noted in five subjects with CFS but was also present in 4/5 healthy twins, indicating this finding likely reflects genetic influences on the sleep electroencephalogram rather than disease-specific sleep pathology.\nThe genetic influences on sleep polysomnography and microarchitecture appear to be stronger than the disease influence of chronic fatigue syndrome, despite greater subjective sleep complaint among the CFS twins. EEG techniques that focus on short duration events or paradigms that probe sleep regulation may provide a better description of sleep abnormalities in CFS.",

    "abstract": "Social competence is one of the most important accomplishments of human development, and this skill in human relationships is learned through communication. Therefore, it is considered that delays in language development could be a barrier to building human relationships and social competence. Although it is well known that there are delays in language development in twins compared with that of singletons, little is known about how these linguistic delays affect the development of social competence. Because twin language is a language that is unique to each pair of twins and cannot be understood by either their mother or others, it may be assumed that the social competence of twins who have a twin language is less than that of twins who don't have a twin language. Therefore, in this prospective longitudinal study we also investigated the relationship between twin language and social competence. A mailed questionnaire survey was conducted in 958 mothers as a follow-up of a study conducted in 2004. As a result, 522 respondents returned the questionnaire (53.9%). In this study, we used only 256 twins aged 6- 12-years-old (school-age children) for analysis, excluding those with missing values. Multiple logistic regression analysis was employed. In the second child of twins, a low birth weight, the appearance of twin language and gestosis of the mother were positively related with social unbalance (OR = 1.846, 2.022 and 1.903). On the other hand, with the first child, however, there was no such link. The present results indicate that twin language might influence social competence in school-age children. It has been believed that linguistic intervention is unnecessary, because most twin language disappears spontaneously. However, early intervention, for example linguistic assistance by public health nurses or psychologists and early enrollment in a preschool may be necessary for twins with a twin language, to avoid adverse consequences in social competence at school-age.",

While bone quality measures have been frequently studied, the ability of simple measures of impaired balance to predict fracture risk has received less attention. Computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted between 1998 and 2000 among 24,598 Swedish twins aged 55 years or older. Impaired balance at the time of interview was reported by 2,890 (12%) of the twins. Twin pairs who were discordant with regard to impaired balance were selected for analysis and followed for fractures through 2005. In a pairwise analysis, the odds ratio for hip fracture was 3.13 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.62, 6.05) among twins with impaired balance as compared with their co-twins with normal balance. When previously recognized clinical risk factors for osteoporotic fracture were considered in the model, the odds ratio for hip fracture with impaired balance was 3.88 (95% CI: 1.40, 10.72). Approximately 40% of all hip fractures were attributable to impaired balance. The odds ratios for any fracture and any osteoporotic fracture for twins with impaired balance were 2.00 (95% CI: 1.29, 3.11) and 2.39 (95% CI: 1.49, 3.82), respectively. These results imply that self-reported impaired balance is a novel and readily assessed risk factor for future fractures in the elderly.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare complication of monochorionic twinning. Although most conjoined twins are stillborn or die in the newborn period, surgical advances are such that many parents will continue a pregnancy in the hopes that live born infants can be separated. Well-described types of conjoined twins account for most cases, with some rarer forms occasionally seen. Each type is associated with specific degrees of organ sharing, structural abnormalities, complications, and challenges with regard to potential separation. Thorough multidisciplinary prenatal assessment of conjoined twins is essential to appropriately counsel parents, to manage the pregnancy, and to create an appropriate delivery plan. This pictorial essay presents the imaging findings of the more common types of conjoined twins. Selected clinical and autopsy images are used to illustrate shared anatomy. The nomenclature for description of conjoined twins is reviewed, the imaging findings of each type are illustrated, and the challenges to separation are discussed.",

Mean gestational age of the twin pairs was 32.6 weeks (range, 24-39).\nThe ParadigmHealth database was queried for all twin admissions from January 2001 to June 2004 admitted to 453 NICUs across the United States. Discordance was calculated for each twin set as defined as greater than 20% difference in birth weight. Exclusion criteria were death of a twin, congenital anomalies, or extracorporeal life support.\nDemographics, respiratory needs, feeding characteristics, complications, and discharge needs.\nA total of 384 discordant twin pairs met inclusion criteria. The larger twins required more ventilation/continuous positive airway pressure (55% vs 44%, P < .01) and/or oxygen therapy (50% vs 41%, P = .02) compared with smaller twins. Smaller twins reached full oral (PO) feeds an average of 0.6 weeks later than larger twins (P < .0001) but had more weight gain per day. Smaller twins transitioned to an open crib at lower weights but at slightly greater age. No differences were noted with necrotizing enterocolitis or apnea. Smaller twins had increased nosocomial infections. Mean length of stay was shorter (P = .0036) in the larger twin group. Only 33% of the twin pairs were discharged on the same day.\nLarger twins had more acute respiratory issues but achieved certain milestones more rapidly with fewer complications, thus leading to earlier discharge compared with their smaller twin counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Both obesity and exercise behavior are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. However, whether obesity and physical inactivity share the same genetic vs environmental etiology has rarely been studied. We therefore analyzed these complex relationships, and also examined whether physical activity modifies the degree of genetic influence on body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC).\nThe FinnTwin16 Study is a population-based, longitudinal study of five consecutive birth cohorts (1975-1979) of Finnish twins. Data on height, weight, WC and physical activity of 4343 subjects at the average age of 25 (range, 22-27 years) years were obtained by a questionnaire and self-measurement of WC. Quantitative genetic analyses based on linear structural equations were carried out by the Mx statistical package. The modifying effect of physical activity on genetic and environmental influences was analyzed using gene-environment interaction models.\nThe overall heritability estimates were 79% in males and 78% in females for BMI, 56 and 71% for WC and 55 and 54% for physical activity, respectively. There was an inverse relationship between physical activity and WC in males (r = -0.12) and females (r=-0.18), and between physical activity and BMI in females (r = -0.12). Physical activity significantly modified the heritability of BMI and WC, with a high level of physical activity decreasing the additive genetic component in BMI and WC.\nPhysically active subjects were leaner than sedentary ones, and physical activity reduced the influence of genetic factors to develop high BMI and WC.

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that genetic factors are involved in the occurrence of sleep terrors. Twin studies provide invaluable information regarding genetic and environmental factors that can affect the manifestation of the disease; however, most previous twin studies on sleep terrors were performed retrospectively or with a sample that was too small to yield conclusive results. The aim of this large prospective study was to clarify the genetic and environmental contributions to sleep terrors in childhood.\nIn all, 390 pairs of monozygotic and dizygotic twins were recruited at birth for a longitudinal study. The prevalence and frequency of sleep terrors were assessed at 18 and 30 months of age with a questionnaire administered to the biological mother of the twins. Zygosity was determined by a questionnaire and genotyping. The prevalence and polychoric correlation for each type of twins were calculated. Structural-equation modeling was used to determine the proportion of variance attributable to additive genetic, shared, and nonshared environmental factors.\nThe prevalence of sleep terrors was 36.9% at 18 months and 19.7% at 30 months; 49% of affected children were boys, and 51% were girls. At 18 months, the polychoric correlations were 0.63 for monozygotic and 0.36 for the dizygotic twins. These were 0.68 (monozygotic) and 0.24 (dizygotic) at 30 months. Our model-fitting analysis showed that sleep terrors were explained by a 2-component model at 18 months (43.7% additive genetic effects and 56.3% nonshared environment) and at 30 months (41.5% additive genetic effects and 58.5% nonshared environment).\nThese results strongly support the heritability of sleep terrors. There also seems to be continuity in genetic effects with the persistence of sleep-terror symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The human distal gut harbours a vast ensemble of microbes (the microbiota) that provide important metabolic capabilities, including the ability to extract energy from otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides. Studies of a few unrelated, healthy adults have revealed substantial diversity in their gut communities, as measured by sequencing 16S rRNA genes, yet how this diversity relates to function and to the rest of the genes in the collective genomes of the microbiota (the gut microbiome) remains obscure. Studies of lean and obese mice suggest that the gut microbiota affects energy balance by influencing the efficiency of calorie harvest from the diet, and how this harvested energy is used and stored. Here we characterize the faecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity, and their mothers, to address how host genotype, environmental exposure and host adiposity influence the gut microbiome. Analysis of 154 individuals yielded 9,920 near full-length and 1,937,461 partial bacterial 16S rRNA sequences, plus 2.14 gigabases from their microbiomes. The results reveal that the human gut microbiome is shared among family members, but that each person's gut microbial community varies in the specific bacterial lineages present, with a comparable degree of co-variation between adult monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. However, there was a wide array of shared microbial genes among sampled individuals, comprising an extensive, identifiable 'core microbiome' at the gene, rather than at the organismal lineage, level. Obesity is associated with phylum-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial diversity and altered representation of bacterial genes and metabolic pathways. These results demonstrate that a diversity of organismal assemblages can nonetheless yield a core microbiome at a functional level, and that deviations from this core are associated with different physiological states (obese compared with lean).",

    "abstract": "Although twin deliveries after assisted reproduction treatment (ART) are common, the mental health of the parents has scarcely been addressed. Therefore, we evaluated the psychological well-being of ART and spontaneously conceiving parents of twins and singletons. Furthermore, the impact of parity and children's health-related factors on mental health was evaluated.\nWe conducted a prospective longitudinal questionnaire study among ART parents of 91 pairs of twins and of 367 singletons and on control parents of 20 pairs of twins and of 379 singletons in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy (T1), and when the children were 2 months (T2) and 1-year old (T3). Symptoms of depression and anxiety, sleeping difficulties and social dysfunction were addressed via a questionnaire. The effects of parity and child-related factors were assessed at T2.\nAt T1, ART mothers of twins showed fewer symptoms of depression than control mothers of twins (P < 0.05). At T2, both ART and control mothers of twins had more symptoms of depression and anxiety than all mothers of singletons (F = 5.20, P < 0.05 and F = 3.93, P < 0.05, respectively). At T3, both ART and control mothers of twins continued to report more symptoms of depression than the mothers of singletons (F = 10.01, P < 0.01), but a difference in anxiety symptoms was seen only in the control group. All fathers had similar mental health at T1. At T2, ART and control fathers of twins reported more symptoms of depression (F = 4.15, P < 0.05) and social dysfunction than fathers of singletons. At T3, both ART and control fathers of twins had more symptoms of depression (F = 4.29, P < 0.05) and anxiety (F = 5.40, P < 0.05) than fathers of singletons. Control fathers of twins had more sleeping difficulties than fathers of singletons (F = 6.66, P < 0.01). Parity did not differently affect parental mental health at T2 in the study groups. Prematurity did not affect maternal mental health, but it had a negative impact on control fathers' social dysfunction (F = 3.34, P < 0.05).\nTwin parenthood, but not ART, has a negative impact on the mental health of mothers and fathers during the transition to parenthood.

We applied our multi-template segmentation approach termed \"Multi-Atlas Fluid Image Alignment\" to fluidly propagate hand-labeled parameterized surface meshes, labeling the lateral ventricles, in 3D volumetric MRI scans of 76 identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins (38 pairs; mean age=24.6 (SD=1.7)); and 56 same-sex fraternal (dizygotic, DZ) twins (28 pairs; mean age=23.0 (SD=1.8)), scanned as part of a 5-year research study that will eventually study over 1000 subjects. Mesh surfaces were averaged within subjects to minimize segmentation error. We fitted quantitative genetic models at each of 30,000 surface points to measure the proportion of shape variance attributable to (1) genetic differences among subjects, (2) environmental influences unique to each individual, and (3) shared environmental effects. Surface-based statistical maps, derived from path analysis, revealed patterns of heritability, and their significance, in 3D. Path coefficients for the 'ACE' model that best fitted the data indicated significant contributions from genetic factors (A=7.3%), common environment (C=38.9%) and unique environment (E=53.8%) to lateral ventricular volume. Earlier-maturing occipital horn regions may also be more genetically influenced than later-maturing frontal regions. Maps visualized spatially-varying profiles of environmental versus genetic influences. The approach shows promise for automatically measuring gene-environment effects in large image databases.",

    "abstract": "The chloroplast cpn20 protein is a functional homolog of the cpn10 co-chaperonin, but its gene consists of two cpn10-like units joined head-to-tail by a short chain of amino acids. This double protein is unique to plastids and was shown to exist in plants as well plastid-containing parasites. In vitro assays showed that this cpn20 co-chaperonin is a functional homolog of cpn10. In terms of structure, existing data indicate that the oligomer is tetrameric, yet it interacts with a heptameric cpn60 partner. Thus, the functional oligomeric structure remains a mystery. In this review, we summarize what is known about this distinctive chaperonin and use a bioinformatics approach to examine the expression of cpn20 in Arabidopsis thaliana relative to other chaperonin genes in this species. In addition, we examine the primary structure of the two homologous domains for similarities and differences, in comparison with cpn10 from other species. Lastly, we hypothesize as to the oligomeric structure and raison d'\u00eatre of this unusual co-chaperonin homolog.",

    "abstract": "Earlier studies have established that a substantial percentage of variance in obesity-related phenotypes is explained by genetic components. However, only one study has used both virtual twins (VTs) and biological twins and was able to simultaneously estimate additive genetic, non-additive genetic, shared environmental and unshared environmental components in body mass index (BMI). Our current goal was to re-estimate four components of variance in BMI, applying a more rigorous model to biological and virtual multiples with additional data. Virtual multiples share the same family environment, offering unique opportunities to estimate common environmental influence on phenotypes that cannot be separated from the non-additive genetic component using only biological multiples.\nData included 929 individuals from 164 monozygotic twin pairs, 156 dizygotic twin pairs, five triplet sets, one quadruplet set, 128 VT pairs, two virtual triplet sets and two virtual quadruplet sets. Virtual multiples consist of one biological child (or twins or triplets) plus one same-aged adoptee who are all raised together since infancy. We estimated the additive genetic, non-additive genetic, shared environmental and unshared random components in BMI using a linear mixed model. The analysis was adjusted for age, age(2), age(3), height, height(2), height(3), gender and race.\nBoth non-additive genetic and common environmental contributions were significant in our model (P-values<0.0001). No significant additive genetic contribution was found. In all, 63.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 51.8-75.3%) of the total variance of BMI was explained by a non-additive genetic component, 25.7% (95% CI 13.8-37.5%) by a common environmental component and the remaining 10.7% by an unshared component.\nOur results suggest that genetic components play an essential role in BMI and that common environmental factors such as diet or exercise also affect BMI. This conclusion is consistent with our earlier study using a smaller sample and shows the utility of virtual multiples for separating non-additive genetic variance from common environmental variance.",

    "abstract": "Habitual dietary intake is a complex behavior that may have both biological and nonbiological bases. We estimated the contribution of genetic and environmental influences on dietary intake in a large population-based sample of healthy twins. Data originated from a cross-sectional study of 600 male and female healthy twin pairs with self-reported food consumption frequency using a validated questionnaire with 247 foods and recipes. Estimates of relative proportion of additive genetic, nonadditive genetic, shared environmental, and unshared environmental effects on various aspects of dietary intake were obtained by quantitative genetic modeling of twin data based on linear structural equations. The analyses demonstrated genetic influence on total energy, macronutrient energy, and dietary fiber intakes, the glycemic index and the glycemic load of the foods consumed, and the dietary energy density, with significant heritability estimates ranging from 0.25 (0.11-0.38) to 0.47 (0.31-0.60) in men and 0.32 (0.12-0.48) to 0.49 (0.35-0.61) in women. When analyzing dietary intake as the intake of energy from 20 food groups, the genetic and environmental influences differed among food groups and between gender. For some food groups (fruit for both genders, poultry and eggs for men), no genetic influence was found, whereas nonadditive genetic effects were demonstrated for other food groups (juices and eggs for women). A number of food groups had shared environmental influences (potatoes, vegetables, fruits, poultry, fish, margarine, and candy). These results provide evidence for both genetic and shared environmental effects on dietary intake. Although the remaining nonshared environmental effects include measurement errors, there appears to be considerable potential for individually modifiable effects.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic dental injuries are a major cause of morbidity among children. Investigation of risk factors of dental trauma is important to take preventive measures in patients at high risk for tooth accidents. The aim of this work was to conduct a pilot study in twins, assessing concordance of suffered traumatic dental and facial injuries. Comparison of concordances between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs was performed in order to investigate possible genetically determined accident-proneness. Standardized interviews were conducted focusing on the frequency of orofacial accidents and their circumstances. In addition, the front teeth of all participating twins were clinically examined. A total of 104 twins (52 twin pairs) were surveyed: 31 of the 52 twin pairs were DZ and 21 pairs were MZ. 36 (34.6%) of the 104 interviewees had already suffered from a tooth injury, whereas 53 (51%) of the participants had experienced a facial injury. Investigation of concordances of suffered traumatic dental injuries revealed that 66.7% of the MZ twin pairs and 58.1% of the DZ pairs were concordant. With respect to facial traumata, 52.4% of the MZ pairs compared to 58.1% of the DZ pairs were concordant. Differences between zygosity were not statistically significant (P >/= 0.05). With the present pilot study, no statistical evidence of genetic risk for dental and facial injuries could be displayed. On the contrary, environmental factors seem to dominate in determining an individual's risk for orofacial traumata.",

    "abstract": "If the adaptive significance of specific fears changes with age, the genetic contribution to individual differences may be lowest at the age of greatest salience. The roles of genes and environment in the developmental-genetic trajectory of five common childhood fears are explored in 1094 like-sex pairs of male and female monozygotic and dizygotic twins assessed on up to three occasions during adolescence (ages 8-18 years).\nDichotomous self-ratings of a cluster of five correlated fears from Ollendick's schedule of fears (FSSC-R) were extracted for subjects at each occasion of assessment. The effects of genes and environment on overall level of fears and rates of adolescent decline were explored by fitting an item-response theory ('IRT') model that allowed for individual genetic and environmental differences in initial fear level ('intercept') and rates of adolescent change ('slope') across the repeated waves of measurement. Different forms of the model were explored using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to derive the posterior distribution of subject and item parameters from the raw responses.\nAdditive genetic differences affect the common factor underlying the five fear-items. The same genes also affect rates of change with age, especially in boys. Male adolescents with higher overall genetic predisposition to childhood fears tended to show slower recovery with age than subjects with relatively low initial values. Thus, the genetic variance apparently increases with age.\nThis finding is consistent with a prediction that the regulation of genetic differences will be strongest, and thus the additive genetic variance will be smallest, at the age when the particular stimulus is most salient. Items differed in the extent to which they were sensitive to underlying random differences in the rate of developmental change. Individual differences in rates of change with age were more marked in boys than girls.",

    "abstract": "Common polymorphisms of the CD36 fatty acid transporter gene have been associated with lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease. Association of a CD36 promoter single nucleotide polymorphism genotype with anthropometry and serum lipids was investigated in normal subjects, and in obese subjects during an 8-week low calorie diet and 6-month weight-maintenance period. 2728 normal female Twins UK subjects (mean body mass index 24.8 +/- 4.4 kg/m2; age 47.3 +/- 12.5 y) and 183 obese male and female Spanish subjects (mean body mass index 30.6 +/- 3.0 kg/m2; age 35.0 +/- 5.0 y) were genotyped for the CD36-22674 T/C (rs2151916) promoter single nucleotide polymorphism. In the Twins UK full cohort, the C-allele was associated with lower low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p = .02, N = 2396). No associations were found in the obese Spanish subjects at baseline, but 6 months after the end of the low-calorie diet, the C-allele was associated with lower total- (p = .03) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p = .01) and higher high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p = .01). Intake of saturated fatty acids was lower in carriers of the C-allele at baseline, but not significantly so (p = .11). However, 6 months after the end of the low-calorie diet, elements of the lipid profile were correlated with saturated fatty acid intake: total cholesterol r = .21, p = .060; low density lipoprotein-cholesterol: r = .25, p = .043; high density lipoprotein-cholesterol: r = -.26, p = .007. CD36 promoter SNP allele -22674C is therefore associated with lower serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol in normal female twins and with improved lipid profile during weight loss and maintenance in obese subjects.",

    "abstract": "Recent clinic-based and population-based studies have shown evidence of association between ADHD and autistic symptoms in children and adolescents as well as evidence for genetic overlap between these disorders. The objective of the current study was to confirm the association between autistic and ADHD symptoms in a young adult twin sample assessed by self-report, and investigate whether shared genetic and/or environmental factors can explain the association. We performed twin-based structural equation modeling using self-report data from 11 Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) items and 12 DSM-IV ADHD inattentive and impulsive symptom items obtained from 674 young adult Australian twins. Phenotypic correlation between autistic and ADHD symptoms was moderate. The most parsimonious univariate models for SRS and ADHD included additive genetic effects and unique environmental effects, without sex differences. ADHD and autistic traits were both moderately heritable. In a bivariate model, genetic correlation (r(g)) between SRS and ADHD was 0.72. Our results suggest that in young adults, a substantial proportion of the genetic influences on self-reported autistic and ADHD symptoms may be shared between the two disorders.",

    "abstract": "Life satisfaction and quality of sleep are important, related components of subjective well-being and general health. However, no earlier investigation is known to have tested the direction of the temporal relation between poor sleep and diminished life satisfaction, including simultaneous examination of shared genetic influences. These features were examined in the present study of a nationwide cohort of 18,631 same-sex Finnish twins with repeated measurements of life satisfaction, sleep quality, and several potential confounders within an interval of 6 years (1975 and 1981). Most individuals (59%) with new-onset life dissatisfaction had experienced suboptimal sleep at baseline. Poor sleep predicted a consistent pattern of life dissatisfaction (odds ratio = 2.1, 95% confidence interval: 1.7, 2.7 from logistic regression on individuals; odds ratio = 3.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.7, 5.3 from conditional logistic regression on twin pairs discordant for life dissatisfaction), whereas life dissatisfaction did not consistently predict poor sleep. There was substantial heritability for both traits, but their shared genetic component was relatively weak, as indicated by genetic correlations of 0.21 for men and 0.27 for women in a multivariate genetic model. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that poor sleep may have direct effects on the brain, emotions, and mood.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of daytime cortisol activity has been associated with stress-related pathologies. Research suggests that early environmental adversity might shape cortisol activity. However, little is known about the genetic and environmental contributions to early cortisol and how this varies as a function of environmental circumstances. The goals of the study were to estimate the genetic and environmental contributions to daytime cortisol secretion in infant twins and to investigate whether these contributions varied as a function of familial adversity (FA).\nParticipants were 517 6-month-old twins. Salivary cortisol was collected when the infants woke up at home and in the morning, upon arrival at the laboratory. Familial adversity was defined by seven perinatal and postnatal risk factors: maternal smoking during pregnancy, low birth weight, low family income, low maternal education, single parenthood, young motherhood, and maternal hostile/reactive behaviors. Genetic and environment contributions to cortisol activity were estimated for high (three risk factors or more: 21.3% of the sample) versus low FA.\nGenetic factors accounted for cortisol levels in different ways: a moderate \"main effect\" of genes was found for home-based awakening cortisol, whereas the contribution of genes to morning cortisol was conditional to FA. Genetic factors accounted for most of the variance in morning cortisol in high family adversity but not in low family adversity.\nEarly FA modulates the heritability of morning cortisol in infants. The results are consistent with the diathesis-stress model, with genetic factors more likely to be expressed in adverse settings.",

    "abstract": "We studied twinning and fertility indices in mothers with spontaneous monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins and in mothers who conceived their twins after the use of assisted reproduction techniques (ART). Participants in this study consisted of 8,222 and 5,505 women with spontaneous DZ and MZ offspring and 4,164 and 250 women with ART DZ and MZ twin pairs, respectively. Women were compared with respect to the number of sibs and offspring, the presence of other relatives with twins and the time it took to conceive the twins. We also compared familial twinning between a younger and an older age group. Women with spontaneous DZ twins more often reported female relatives with twins than those with spontaneous MZ twins. The proportion of DZ versus MZ twin offspring in relatives was also larger in women with spontaneous DZ offspring than in women with MZ offspring. The first group of women reported a shorter time to conceive. Women with ART twins had fewer sibs and offspring and less often reported relatives with twins. We did not observe that DZ twinning was more familial in women who had their twins before age 36 years compared to older women. Familial DZ twinning is clearly present in mothers of spontaneous DZ twins. The mechanisms underlying spontaneous and non-spontaneous DZ twinning are different and fertility treatment should be taken into account in any study of twinning. Twinning is not more familial in women who have their twins at a younger age.",

Concordance among male twins for both of these cancers has never been reported. Although the family history suggested possible genetic predispositions to both cancers, the twins have no evidence of the genetic alterations associated with hereditary colorectal tumors. We explore the possibility that colorectal tumorigenesis in these twins was fuelled by a combination of genetic and iatrogenic factors, in particular the androgen deprivation therapy used to treat their prostate cancers.",

    "abstract": "Two recent reports on recurrent cases of umbilical cord stricture (UCS) have opened the debate on the possibility of a genetic basis for this anomaly, traditionally considered to be sporadic. We present a series of 130 cases of UCS located at the fetal insertion, diagnosed among 2067 fetal and infantile autopsies performed during the last 10 years. All cases were macerated stillborn fetuses, and 54.6% were < or =20 weeks of gestational age. Our study is focused on 2 recurrent episodes and 16 cases occurring in multiple pregnancies. Among twins, males were affected more than females (2.2:1), although no statistical significance was found. Associated umbilical cord anomalies were present in 8 of 16 cases, consisting of hypocoiling (3 cases), hypercoiling (2 cases), excessive length (1 case), vascular tortuosity (1 case), and single umbilical artery (1 case). The most frequent placental finding was obliterative endovasculopathy (6 cases), probably indicating a causal relationship with UCS. Zygosity was analyzed by placental histology and/or a panel of 12 microsatellite markers to classify twins as monozygotic (8 cases) or dizygotic (8 cases). Our data prove that UCS is not a genetic condition because all 8 genetically identical twins were discordant for the anomaly and 2 dizygotic twins with UCS had co-twins also affected. Genetic factors are not implicated in UCS pathophysiology, and parents with a fetal demise due to UCS should be counseled as having a low-recurrence risk for subsequent pregnancies. Because there is not a higher incidence of UCS in multiple gestations, twinning should not be considered a risk factor for UCS.",

    "abstract": "In this study we analyzed the etiology of the relationship between personality traits and retrospectively recalled family environment. The data of 226 identical and 168 fraternal twin pairs reared together from the Jena twin study of social attitudes were available. Personality traits were measured using the self- and peer report versions of the German NEO-personality inventory-revised. A German version of Blocks Environmental Questionnaire was applied to measure two broad dimensions of the family environment retrospectively: support and organization. We could replicate earlier findings that retrospective reports of these family environment dimensions were in part genetically influenced. A total of 66% of the genetic variance in support and 24% in organization could be accounted for by heritable variance in self-rated personality. That was replicated by using peer reports of personality, 41% explained genetic variance in support and 17% in organization. Environmental mediations were negligible. This indicates that the relationship between personality and retrospectively recalled family environment is largely genetically mediated.",

    "abstract": "Colloid cysts of the third ventricle are rare benign tumors of endodermal origin accounting for 1% of all intracranial tumors. Interestingly, a few familial cases have been reported previously. We present the first case of dizygotic twins with a symptomatic colloid cyst of the third ventricle.\nA 10-year-old boy was admitted to a local hospital in 1993 because of severe progressive headache. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed acute obstructive hydrocephalus attributable to a third ventricular colloid cyst, which was removed after emergent ventricular drainage. Fourteen years later, a nonidentical twin brother complained of continuous headache with nausea and vomiting. A magnetic resonance imaging scan showed obstructive hydrocephalus and a third ventricle colloid cyst, which was removed by use of the transcallosal approach.\nBoth twins underwent complete removal of the cyst by the interhemispheric transcallosal approach without postoperative complications.\nOn the basis of a literature review, 2 cases of colloid cysts of the third ventricle in monozygotic twins and a few familial cases have been reported. Our case is the first in dizygotic twin brothers. These findings suggest that the prevalence of colloid cyst may be higher in twins than in the general population. We believe that the presence of this lesion in a twin necessitates magnetic resonance imaging of the other twin, and a clinical follow-up would be recommended in all other first-degree relatives.",

    "abstract": "Evidence on pregnancy outcomes of twins conceived by artificial reproductive technology (ART) compared with those naturally conceived (NC) is conflicting. We retrospectively audited outcomes of ART and NC twin births at Royal Maternity Hospital, Belfast from 01.01.2002-31.12.2003. Of 202 twins, 53 (26%) were ART and 149 (74%) were NC. ART group had increased maternal age (p < 0.001), more primiparous mothers (p < 0.001), used more peri-conceptual folic acid (p = 0.01), booked earlier for antenatal care (p < 0.05), delivered by caesarean section (p = 0.035) more often at a later gestation (p = 0.048) with a higher birth weight (p < 0.05). The NC group had increased congenital anomalies (p = 0.005) and babies requiring neonatal intensive care (p = 0.003). Of confirmed cases, ART twins were all dichorionic compared with 81.7% of NC (p = 0.002). Most neonatal outcome differences disappeared when NC dichorionic twins were compared with ART twins. ART twins have fewer complications than NC twins. Chorionicity accounts for most of these differences.",

    "abstract": "This study presents an extended children-of-twins model, which allowed the authors to test the direction of the association between parenting and child adjustment. Three mechanisms were examined: direct phenotypic influence of parenting on child behavior (controlling for both parental and child genotype), passive genotype-environment correlation, and evocative genotype-environment correlation. This model was tested with Monte Carlo simulations. The authors generated data sets consisting of 1,000 twin parent pairs together with their children and 1,000 twin children pairs together with their parents. These simulated data sets were then used to estimate the model, and the procedure was repeated 1,000 times. The simulation results showed that this model recovered the true values of parameters with high precision. The model was also applied to an observed data set to analyze, as a first example, the association between maternal emotional overinvolvement and child internalizing problems. The results showed that this association was best explained by evocative genotype-environment correlation.",

    "abstract": "The study investigated the genetic and environmental contributions to individual differences in measures of socioemotional reactivity and emotion regulation with a sample of 115 monozygotic (MZ) and 156 dizygotic (DZ) 5-month-old twin pairs. Twins' zygosity was determined by a combination of DNA typing and physical similarity. Twins' behaviors (motor activity level, social gaze, gaze aversion, positive expression, negative expression, and self-comfort) were videotaped in a laboratory while infants were presented televised sequences of neutral and happy emotional expressions posed by their mother (familiar condition) and a female stranger (unfamiliar condition). Regardless of the social context, the findings based on model-fitting analyses indicated that nonshared environmental influences explained most of the variance of behavioral data. However, there was evidence that motor activity level (an index of emotional arousal) and the latency and frequency of gaze aversion (an index of emotional regulation) were best represented by a model incorporating both additive genetic and nonshared environmental (i.e., AE) influences when infants were exposed to the unfamiliar adult (heritability estimates ranging from 19% to 31%). The results suggest the importance of nonshared environmental influences during early infancy and stress the role of social context for revealing moderate genetic contributions to individual differences in emotional arousal and emotion regulation.",

    "abstract": "We investigated patterns of cigarette smoking and Swedish snus (oral smokeless tobacco) use in a population-based sample of 19,073 Swedish twins 20-47 years old who participated in the baseline assessment of a prospective study of tobacco use and cessation in 2005-2006. Age-adjusted prevalence odds ratios (POR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI ) describe the association between tobacco use and sex, after adjustment for non-independence of twin pairs. Kaplan-Meier survival methods produced cumulative incidence curves of age at initiation of tobacco use. Slightly more than half of the baseline population was female (55.2%); the mean age at interview was 33.3 (+/-7.2) years and did not differ by sex. Having ever smoked daily was less common among males than females (11.9% vs. 15.3%; POR = 0.70 [0.64-0.77]), while having ever used snus daily was more common among males than females (31.1% vs. 4.8%; POR 11.7 [95% CI = 10.6-13.1]). The median age at initiation of smoking was 15 years for both sexes; median age at onset of snus use was 15 years for males and 18 years for females. Nicotine dependence scores were higher for males than females, and for current than former smokers. Findings from this study are in contrast to our previously published report on tobacco use among 32,123 Swedish twins 42-64 years old who completed a similar survey, and reported lower rates of snus use at later ages. Patterns of tobacco use may be changing in Sweden; snus use appears to be increasing, while daily smoking appears to be decreasing in popularity among the younger Swedish twins.",

    "abstract": "The authors tested the hypothesis that either prenatal feminization or masculinization hormone influences in utero or later socialization affects the risk for anorexia and bulimia nervosa and disordered eating in members of opposite-sex twin pairs.\nFinnish twins (N=2,426 women, N=1,962 men with known zygosity) from birth cohorts born 1974-1979 were assessed at age 22 to 28 years with a questionnaire for eating disorder symptoms. Based on the questionnaire screen, women (N=292), men (N=53), and their cotwins were interviewed to assess diagnoses of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa (per DSM-IV and broad criteria).\nIn women from opposite-sex twin pairs, the prevalence of DSM-IV or broad anorexia nervosa was not significantly different than that of women from monozygotic pairs or same-sex dizygotic pairs. Of the five male anorexia nervosa probands, only one was from an opposite-sex twin pair. Bulimia nervosa in men was too rare to be assessed by zygosity; the prevalence of DSM-IV or broad bulimia nervosa did not differ in women from opposite- versus same-sex twin pairs. In both sexes, the overall profile of indicators on eating disorders was rather similar between individuals from opposite- and same-sex pairs.\nThe authors found little evidence that the risk for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or disordered eating was associated with zygosity or sex composition of twin pairs, thus making it unlikely that in utero femininization or masculinization or socialization effects of growing up with an opposite-sex twin have a major influence on the later development of eating disorders.",

    "abstract": "To our knowledge, no prior twin studies have examined genetic and environmental contributions to the association of depressive symptoms and cigarette smoking in adolescence.\nGenetic and environmental contributions to the covariation of depressive symptoms and cigarette smoking were estimated among 287 monozygotic and 441 dizygotic adolescent twin pairs from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.\nDepressive symptoms were measured using an 18-item modified version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). Smoking involvement was defined using an ordinal scale based on smoking recency and frequency.\nDepressive symptoms and smoking were significantly correlated in both males and females. Twin modeling indicated that, in females, the correlation was attributable in part to common genetic factors and in part to environmental factors not shared among twins, or nonshared environment. In males, the correlation between depressive symptoms and smoking was solely attributable to nonshared environment.\nNonshared environmental correlations in males and females lend support to a direct causal relationship between depressive symptoms and smoking in adolescence. However, the additional common genetic vulnerability in females suggested that common genetic factors also contribute, particularly among adolescent females.",

    "abstract": "Dandy-Walker syndrome (DWS) is a developmental malformation of the central nervous system characterized by complete or partial absence of the cerebellar vermis, the presence of a posterior fossa cyst, and ventriculomegaly. Although DWS can be seen with Mendelian and chromosomal disorders, the actual pathophysiologic mechanism responsible for the syndrome is unknown. The incidence of DWS is approximately 1-8/100,000 births. We have noted a higher than expected incidence of DWS in a population of twins referred as complicated monochorionic twins, to include twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of DWS in monochorionic twins.\nThe database of all patients referred with complicated monochorionic twins was queried for the diagnosis of DWS. TTTS was defined sonographically as the combined presence of a maximum vertical pocket (MVP) of >or=8 cm in the recipient and <or=2 cm in the donor twin. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) was defined as <or=10(th) percentile for gestational age. DWS was diagnosed sonographically as partial or total absence of the cerebellar vermis, the presence of a posterior fossa cyst, and ventriculomegaly. Risk factors for DWS included fetal status (donor/small twin, recipient/large twin), TTTS stage, absent end-diastolic velocity in the umbilical artery (AEDV), and IUGR.\nThe data on 660 patients with monochorionic twin pregnancies were reviewed. DWS was seen in 10 (1.5%) patients (four TTTS, five IUGR, and one monoamniotic twin). The affected fetus was the smaller twin (donor or IUGR) in 8/10 cases (80%, p = 0.055, RR 1.64 (1.17-2.19)). DWS fetuses were more likely to be growth-restricted (7/10, 70% vs. 217/650, 33.4%, p = 0.03) than the non-DWS counterparts.\nThe incidence of DWS in complicated monochorionic twins is approximately 200 times higher than expected for singletons (p < 0.001). DWS is more likely to occur in the smaller twin of a twin pair and more likely to have growth restriction. These findings may assist in our understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the development of DWS.",

To obtain objective and explorative results concerning differences in glucose metabolism, the analysis was performed utilising modern voxel-based analysis methodology statistical parametric mapping and automated region-of-interest analysis.\nIn the demented MZ and DZ co-twins, cerebral glucose metabolism was extensively reduced compared with controls. The non-demented MZ co-twins showed reduced metabolism in inferior frontal, lateral temporal, parietal and medial temporal cortices as well as in the thalamus, putamen and right amygdala. In contrast, no reductions were found in the non-demented DZ co-twins. The reduction found in the non-demented MZ co-twins may be an indicator of genetic susceptibility to AD.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been proposed as a biological endophenotype for affective disorders. In the present study the hypothesis that a high genetic liability to affective disorder is associated with higher cortisol levels was tested in a cross-sectional high-risk study. Healthy monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins with (High-Risk twins) and without (Low-Risk twins) a co-twin history of affective disorder were identified through nationwide registers. Awakening and evening salivary cortisol levels were compared between the 190 High- and Low-Risk twins. The 109 High-Risk twins had significantly higher evening cortisol levels than the 81 Low-Risk MZ twins, also after adjustment for age, sex, and the level of subclinical depressive symptoms. No significant difference was found in awakening cortisol levels between High-Risk and Low-Risk twins. In conclusion, a high genetic liability to affective disorder was associated with a higher evening cortisol level, but not with awakening cortisol level. Future prospective family, high-risk and twin studies are needed to decide whether abnormalities in the HPA axis can be identified as an endophenotype of affective disorder.",

    "abstract": "The spontaneous resolution of isolated tonsillar ectopia in Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) is a known and reported entity in 2 previous single study case reports. However, it has not been previously described in monozygotic twins. Two children, approximately 1 year of age with CM-I and presumed episodes of pallid syncope or breath-holding spells presented for neurosurgical evaluation. Although Chiari decompression was considered, the authors decided to proceed with conservative management with close follow-up due to the uncertain nature of these episodes. Approximately 4 years later, both children's symptoms had resolved. Repeated MR imaging examinations also showed spontaneous resolution of the malformation in both girls. These cases emphasize that when patients with CM-I present with atypical symptoms, spontaneous resolution or improvement is possible, which may influence the decision to pursue a trial of nonsurgical management. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms and genetic influences of CM-I are also briefly discussed.",

    "abstract": "We examine the interaction between stressful life events (SLE) and genotypes for the length polymorphism of the serotonin receptor gene (5HTTLPR) on risk of depression. We hypothesize that if the interaction is real, monozygotic twin pairs (MZT) homozygous for the short allele (SS) will have a greater within pair variance in depression measures than MZT homozygous for the long allele (LL), as a reflection of their increased sensitivity to unknown environmental risk factors. Telephone interviews were used to assess symptoms of depression and suicidality on 824 MZT. Rather than using the interview items to calculate sum scores or allocate diagnostic classes we use Item Response Theory to model the contribution of each item to each individual's underlying liability to depression. SLE were also measured on the MZT assessed by mailed questionnaire on average 3.8 years previously, and these were used in follow-up analyses. We find no evidence for significant differences in within pair variance between 5HTTLPR genotypic classes and so can provide no support for interaction between these genotypes and the environment. The use of MZT provides a novel framework for examining genotype x environment interaction in the absence of measures on SLE.",

    "abstract": "To compare fetal cardiac output (CO) in donor and recipient twins of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) pregnancies after laser therapy with that of monochorionic twins without TTTS and normal singletons.\nIn a longitudinal, prospective study, we sonographically assessed fetal CO in donors (n = 10) and recipients (n = 10) with TTTS after fetoscopic laser therapy, in monochorionic twins without TTTS (n = 20) and in normal singleton pregnancies (n = 20). The fetal CO of TTTS twins was determined 1 day and 1 week after laser treatment, and from then on every 2-4 weeks until birth. Twins without TTTS were examined biweekly until birth. Singletons were examined twice, with an 8-week interval, at different gestational ages between 17 and 35 weeks.\nAbsolute CO increased exponentially with advancing gestational age (P < 0.0001), and was significantly related to fetal weight in all groups (P < 0.0001). The median CO/kg in donors after laser therapy, recipients after laser therapy and non-TTTS monochorionic twins was significantly higher than that in singletons (all P < 0.001). Median CO/kg in donors after laser therapy, recipients after laser therapy, and non-TTTS monochorionic twins was not significantly different between groups.\nMonochorionic twins with TTTS have higher CO after laser therapy than normal singletons.",

    "abstract": "In spite of the lack of evidence for its efficacy, and of sporadic reports of severe adverse events, codeine is still widely used as an antitussive agent in children. A 3-year-old boy (twin 1) was found lying in vomit and apnoeic at night; he was resuscitated and immediately transferred to our paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Two and a half hours later, his twin brother (twin 2) was found dead in his bed at home. Twin 1 required mechanical ventilation for 3 days, but he eventually made a full recovery; autopsy in twin 2 showed massive aspiration of gastric content. History revealed that the monozygotic twins had an upper respiratory tract infection for several days and had both been given codeine at a dose of \"10 drops per day\" by their mother. The blood of both twins was found to contain high levels of codeine and its metabolites. The weight of \"10 drops\" was determined experimentally and was found to range from 494 to 940 mg. Thus, the highest possible dose given by mother was 23.5 mg of codeine instead of the recommended 10 mg. The twins had identical CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms corresponding to the \"extensive metaboliser\" type.\nBecause of the variability of drop size drug dosage, dosage \"by drops\" is unprecise and may result in accidental overdose. The combination of repeated overdosing and extensive metabolism to morphine is likely to have caused apnoea in these twins. These cases illustrate the danger of codeine as an antitussive in young children.",

    "abstract": "It is estimated that there is at least a 2-fold rise in the incidence of monozygotic twinning after assisted reproductive technology compared with natural conception. This can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and SCISEARCH for studies that estimated the risk of monozygotic twinning and its association with any particular assisted reproductive technique. Monozygotic twinning was defined by ultrasound or Weinberg criteria. A meta-analysis of the proportion of monozygotic twins was performed using both fixed and random effects models.\nThe search revealed 37 publications reporting on the incidence of monozygotic twins after assisted reproductive techniques. Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The summary incidence of monozygotic twins after assisted conception was 0.9% (0.8-0.9%). The incidence of monozygotic twins in natural conception is 0.4%. Blastocyst transfer and intracytoplasmic sperm injection are associated with 4.25 and 2.25 times higher risk of monozygotic twins.\nThe risk of monozygotic twins in assisted conception is 2.25 times higher than the natural conceptions. Larger studies reporting on monozygotic twinning following single-embryo transfer or after post-natal confirmation of zygosity with DNA analysis are warranted before definitive conclusions can be drawn and guidelines produced. In order to provide adequate pre-conceptional counselling, it is important to monitor the incidence of monozygotic twins in both natural and assisted conceptions. We suggest building a national multiple pregnancy database based on accurate diagnosis of zygosity.",

    "abstract": "No previous studies on the effect of genetic factors on the liability to disability retirement have been carried out. The main aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of genetic factors on disability retirement due to the most common medical causes, including depressive disorders.\nThe study sample consisted of 24,043 participants (49.7% women) consisting of 11,186 complete same-sex twin pairs including 3519 monozygotic (MZ) and 7667dizygotic (DZ) pairs. Information on retirement events during 1.1.1975-31.12.2004, including disability pensions (DPs) with diagnoses, was obtained from the Finnish nationwide official pension registers. Correlations in liability for MZ and DZ twins and discrete time correlated frailty model were used to investigate the genetic liability to age at disability retirement.\nThe 30 year cumulative incidence of disability retirement was 20%. Under the best fitting genetic models, the heritability estimate for DPs due to any medical cause was 0.36 (95% CI 0.32-0.40), due to musculoskeletal disorders 0.37 (0.30-0.43), cardiovascular diseases 0.48 (0.39-0.57), mental disorders 0.42 (0.35-0.49) and all other reasons 0.24 (0.17-0.31). The effect of genetic factors decreased with increasing age of retirement. For DP due to depressive disorders, 28% of the variance was explained by environmental factors shared by family members (95% CI 21-36) and 58% of the variance by the age interval specific environmental factors (95% CI 44-71).\nA moderate genetic contribution to the variation of disability retirement due to any medical cause was found. The genetic effects appeared to be stronger at younger ages of disability retirement suggesting the increasing influence of environmental factors not shared with family members with increasing age. Familial aggregation in DPs due to depressive disorders was best explained by the common environmental factors and genetic factors were not needed to account for the pattern of familial aggregation.",

    "abstract": "To compute the common and specific genetic and environmental contributions to nicotine dependence (ND) alcohol dependence (AD) and cannabis dependence (CD).\nTwin model.\nData from 1874 monozygotic and 1498 dizygotic twin pair members of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry were obtained via telephone administration of a structured psychiatric interview in 1992.\nData to derive life-time diagnoses of DSM-III-R ND, AD and CD were obtained via telephone administration of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule.\nThe best-fitting model allowed for additive genetic contributions and unique environmental influences that were common to all three phenotypes. Risks for ND and AD were also due to genetic and unique environmental influences specific to each drug. A specific shared environmental factor contributed to CD.\nThese results suggest that the life-time co-occurrence of ND, AD and CD is due to common and specific genetic factors as well as unique environmental influences, and vulnerability for CD is also due to shared environmental factors that do not contribute to ND and AD. The majority of genetic variance is shared across drugs and the majority of unique environmental influences are drug-specific in these middle-aged men. Because differences between models allowing for specific genetic versus shared environment were small, we are most confident in concluding that there are specific familial contributions-either additive genetic or shared environment-to CD.",

    "abstract": "To explore the developmental relationships between early-onset depressive disorders and later use of addictive substances.\nA sample of 1545 adolescent twins was drawn from a prospective, longitudinal study of Finnish adolescent twins with baseline assessments at age 14 years and follow-up at age 17.5 years.\nAt baseline, DSM-IV diagnoses were assessed with a professionally administered adolescent version of Semi-Structured Assessment for Genetics of Alcoholism (C-SSAGA-A). At follow-up, substance use outcomes were assessed via self-reported questionnaire.\nEarly-onset depressive disorders predicted daily smoking [odds ratio (OR) 2.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49-3.50, P < 0.001], smokeless tobacco use (OR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.32-3.04, P = 0.001), frequent illicit drug use (OR = 4.71, 95% CI 1.95-11.37, P = 0.001), frequent alcohol use (OR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.04-3.92, P = 0.037) and recurrent intoxication (OR = 1.83, 95% CI 1.18-2.85, P = 0.007) 3 years later. ORs remained significant after adjustment for comorbidity and exclusion of baseline users. In within-family analysis of depression-discordant co-twins (analyses that control for shared genetic and familial background factors), early-onset depressive disorders at age 14 predicted significantly frequent use of smokeless tobacco and alcohol at age 17.5.\nOur results suggest important predictive associations between early-onset depressive disorders and addictive substance use, and these associations appear to be independent of shared familial influences.",

    "abstract": "Parents of monozygotic twins typically learn to recognise their own children and also to tell them apart on photographs. However, it is unknown whether such exemplar expertise can be generalised to unfamiliar faces of equal similarity (ie other twins). In the present study, parents of monozygotic twins were compared to 'control' parents whose children were non-twin siblings. In a same/different task with familiar and unfamiliar twin faces as stimuli, twins' parents were faster than control parents in distinguishing their own children, but slower when distinguishing unfamiliar twin faces. These unexpected findings can be interpreted as a generalisation of a habitual perceptual strategy that is efficient only with familiar face exemplars. When pictures of the twins' faces were inverted by 180degrees, the typical inversion costs for familiar faces were observed, but the twins' parents recognised unfamiliar twins' faces better when these were inverted than when upright. This inverted inversion effect could be caused by the high similarity of the face pairs as well as by experience with familiar faces of equally high similarity. We conclude that the facial expertise of twins' parents is idiosyncratic to their own children and not based on an enhanced general facial expertise.",

    "abstract": "Retinol-binding protein (RBP) 4 is an adipokine of which plasma levels are elevated in obesity and type 2 diabetes. The aims of the study were to identify determinants of plasma RBP4 and RBP4 mRNA expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and skeletal muscle and to investigate the association between RBP4 and in vivo measures of glucose metabolism.\nThe study population included 298 elderly twins (aged 62-83 years), with glucose tolerance ranging from normal to overt type 2 diabetes, and 178 young (aged 25-32 years) and elderly (aged 58-66 years) nondiabetic twins. Peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity was assessed by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, and beta-cell function was estimated from an intravenous glucose tolerance test.\nThe influence of environmental versus genetic factors in the regulation of plasma RBP4 increased with age. Plasma RBP4 was elevated in type 2 diabetes and increased with duration of disease. Plasma RBP4 correlated inversely with peripheral, but not hepatic, insulin sensitivity. However, the association disappeared after correction for covariates, including plasma adiponectin. Plasma retinol, and not RBP4, was inversely associated with insulin secretion. SAT RBP4 expression correlated positively with GLUT4 expression and inversely with glucose tolerance. Skeletal muscle RBP4 expression reflected intramuscular fat, and although it was suppressed by insulin, no association with insulin sensitivity was evident. RBP4 expression was not associated with circulatory RBP4.\nIn conclusion, our data indicate that RBP4 levels in plasma, skeletal muscle, and fat may be linked to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in a secondary and noncausal manner.",

    "abstract": "Human brain development is created through continuing complex interactions of genetic and environmental influences. The challenge of linking specific genetic or environmental risk factors to typical or atypical behaviors has led to interest in using brain structural features as an intermediate phenotype. Twin studies in adults have found that many aspects of brain anatomy are highly heritable, demonstrating that genetic factors provide a significant contribution to variation in brain structures. Less is known about the relative impact of genes and environment while the brain is actively developing. We summarize results from the ongoing National Institute of Mental Health child and adolescent twin study that suggest that heritability of different brain areas changes over the course of development in a regionally specific fashion. Areas associated with more complex reasoning abilities become increasingly heritable with maturation. The potential mechanisms by which gene-environment interactions may affect heritability values during development is discussed.",

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are a group of common congenital malformations of the brain and spine generated during neurulation. The genetic basis of this process is still not well known. Whenever an NTD is diagnosed in one of a pair of twins, the other twin should also be evaluated for NTDs.",

    "abstract": "Lummaa et al. (2007) presented historical data collected from twins born in Finland between 1734 and 1888 which suggested that females (N = 31) born as part of an opposite sex (OS) twin pair were 25% less likely to reproduce than female twins (N = 35) born as part of a same sex (SS) pair. They hypothesized that this reduction in fitness was due to masculinization of the female fetus via prenatal effects of the hormones of a male fetus. Because such masculinization would presumably take place in modern populations as well, it would seem important to establish to what degree it does so, and if so, whether reproduction is affected. We therefore address the question of reproduction differences in individual female twins from same-sex (N = 1979) and opposite-sex (N = 913) dizygotic pairs in studies carried out in Australia, the Netherlands, and the United States. In all three samples, there were no differences in the number of children or age of first pregnancies in women from same sex pairs compared to those from opposite sex pairs. Similarly, there were no differences in psychological femininity between women from pairs of the same or opposite sex.",

    "abstract": "Deriving their name from the Greek word plastikos, meaning related to molding, plastic surgeons have made their reputation by transplanting tissues from one area of the body to another to \"remold\" defects caused by trauma, congenital anomaly, or disease. Dr. Joseph Murray, a plastic surgeon, performed the first successful kidney transplant between identical twins in 1954. The authors present three cases involving the transplantation of perforator flaps from one identical twin to another for breast reconstruction, including cases using both deep inferior epigastric perforator and superficial inferior epigastric artery flaps.\nThree sets of recipient monozygotic twins that had breasts treated with mastectomies underwent reconstruction using transplanted tissue from their donor monozygotic twins. All sets of twins underwent DNA testing to determine that they were monozygotic; therefore, no immunosuppressive therapy was indicated.\nThe three sets of recipient monozygotic twins underwent successful breast reconstruction using perforator flap transplants from their donor monozygotic twins. The operations included two unilateral reconstructions (one using a deep inferior epigastric perforator flap and the other using a superficial inferior epigastric artery flap) and one bilateral deep inferior epigastric perforator reconstruction. Their hospital courses were unremarkable.\nTransplant surgery continues to evolve in the twenty-first century. The authors present three cases of breast reconstruction using skin flap transplantation as a new option for breast reconstruction.",

Urine osmolality below that of the plasma suggested GDI. 1-deamino-8D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) treatment was started with a quick response. GDI is probably the result of excessive activity of placental vasopressinase. In cases of liver dysfunction, the clearance rate of vasopressinase decreases, explaining the association of GDI with acute fatty liver and HELLP syndrome.

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate whether there is any association between intrauterine growth and later lung function or bronchial reactivity in early adulthood in line with Barker's hypothesis.\nNineteen twin pairs with disproportionate intrauterine growth pattern were followed up from birth: either one of the pairs had intrauterine growth retardation (birth weight <2 SD) or the within-pair birth weight difference was >1.3 SD. Flow-volume spirometry, followed by isocapnic hyperventilation of cold air, was performed at the ages of 8-16 and 14-22 years in 1993 and 1999. Wilcoxon's matched-pairs analysis was used to compare smaller and larger twin pairs.\nIn 1993, there were no significant differences between the groups in either spirometry or cold air challenge. In 1999, such a difference was found in forced expiratory volume % (FEV%) and forced expiratory flow (FEF) at 25%-75%, the smaller twin pairs having lower values. In 1993, nine subjects reacted to cold air (>9% decrease in FEV in 1 second). In 1999, only four subjects reacted to cold air, and they all belonged to the group of smaller twins (P=0.04).\nLung function evaluated by FEV% and FEF25-75 was lower and responses to cold air were more common at the median age of 16 years in twins with impaired intrauterine growth.",

    "abstract": "To determine how genetic and environmental contributions affecting the number of psychoactive substances used varies with age and gender over the course of adolescence.\nEstimates of genetic, shared environmental and non-shared environmental contributions to total variance in diversity of substances used at ages 11, 14 and 17 years were obtained by fitting a multivariate behavior genetic (Cholesky) model.\nA total of 711 male and 675 female twins.\nParticipants reported whether they had used each of 11 substances.\nThe average diversity of substances used increased over time for both males and females, and males generally reported a wider diversity of substances used than females. Influences of genetic factors increased with age and were greater for males than for females at ages 14 and 17 years. Genetic factors remained consistent (i.e. highly correlated) across ages for both males and females, as did shared environmental influences for males. Non-shared environmental factors for both sexes and females' shared environmental factors were age-specific.\nRegardless of sex, the proportion of variance in substances used attributable to genetic factors increases during adolescence, although it is greater for males than females at later ages. These findings indicate that prevention interventions may be most effective if they target early adolescence when environmental factors account for the majority of variance in substance use. The high correlation of genetic factors across ages suggests that early use may sometimes signal an early expression of a developmentally stable genetic predisposition.",

    "abstract": "We report two sets of parasitic twins attached in the thoracic region. Exomphalos major in the autosite was present in both cases. While in case 1, the autosite could be salvaged after easier dissection, in case 2, the autosite could not be salvaged due to the presence of the life-threatening anomalies. The presence of a right-angled communication between the gastrointestinal tracts of the autosite and the independent tactile responses of the parasite from that in the autosite supports the 'fusion theory' to explain the fusion of the embryos that could have led to this defect. The presence of the ano-rectal malformation and common bile duct dilatation exclusively in the parasite appears to be the result of the abnormalities in the endodermal-mesodermal interactions, probably due to the relative positioning of the parasite with respect to the autosite.",

We used an identical-twin, case-control design to investigate whether these abnormalities reflect pre-trauma vulnerability or the acquired consequence of PTSD. Vietnam combat veterans and their non-combat-exposed, identical twins completed a three-tone oddball task. Veterans with PTSD had delayed target N2 latencies compared to veterans without PTSD. In a small nonmedicated, nonsmoking subsample, veterans with PTSD also had significantly diminished target P3b amplitudes. A mixed-model, random-effects analysis on the nonmedicated, nonsmoking subsample that included the combat-unexposed co-twins showed a significant Diagnosis x Combat Exposure interaction for target P3b amplitude. Results replicate increased N2 latency and diminished P3b amplitude in PTSD and suggest that diminished P3b amplitude is an acquired condition in PTSD.",

    "abstract": "In this large population-based twin study, a self-estimated impaired balance, an important risk factor for osteoporotic fractures, had a modest heritability of 0.27. Individual-specific environmental influences seem to be the dominating cause for impaired balance.\nThe principal causal components of an osteoporotic fracture are falls and weakened bone strength. While bone strength has a strong genetic origin, the heritable influences on impaired balance that contribute to the risk of injurious falls at older age are uncertain.\nTo evaluate the heritability and environmental influence on self-reported impaired balance in older men and women, we used data from a sample of 22,998 Swedish twins, 55 to 99 years of age.\nAn impaired balance was reported by 2,890 (12.3%) of the twins. The tetrachoric correlation for impaired balance was only slightly lower for like-sex dizygotic twins (0.31) compared to monozygotic twins (0.36). These correlations indicate a modest familial (genetic and shared environmental) influence. Model fitting results indicate that the age- and sex-adjusted heritability for impaired balance was 0.27 (95%CI = 0.01-0.45). Individual-specific environmental influences differed only slightly by sex and age.\nThese results imply that a self-reported impaired balance, an independent risk factor for osteoporotic fractures, has a modestly heritable etiology in older subjects. Our observation can partly explain the previously observed modest heritability for osteoporotic fractures even though there is a high heritability for bone mineral density.",

    "abstract": "There have been indications that intrauterine and early extrauterine growth can influence childhood mental and motor function. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of intrauterine growth restriction and early extrauterine head growth on the neurodevelopmental outcome of monozygotic twins. Thirty-six monozygous twin pairs were evaluated at the corrected age of 12 to 42 months. Intrauterine growth restriction was quantified using the fetal growth ratio. The effects of birth weight ratio, head circumference at birth and current head circumference on mental and motor outcomes were estimated using mixed-effect linear regression models. Separate estimates of the between (interpair) and within (intrapair) effects of each measure on development were thus obtained. Neurodevelopment was assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd edition, by a psychologist blind to the exposure. A standardized neurological examination was performed by a neuropediatrician who was unaware of the exposures under investigation. After adjustment, birth weight ratio and head circumference at birth were not associated with motor or mental outcomes. Current head circumference was associated with mental but not with motor outcomes. Only the intrapair twin effect was significant. An increase of 1 cm in current head circumference of one twin compared with the other was associated with 3.2 points higher in Mental Developmental Index (95%CI = 1.06-5.32; P < 0.03). Thus, no effect of intrauterine growth was found on cognition and only postnatal head growth was associated with cognition. This effect was not shared by the co-twin.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, is one of the most common autosomal recessive diseases in Caucasians. We screened for the CFTR gene mutation in a Caucasian father with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), a Taiwanese mother, and twins resulting from an intracytoplasmic single sperm injection (ICSI) procedure. DNA fragments that showed abnormal banding patterns on temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis analysis followed by analysis of DNA sequence was used. The Caucasian father with CBAVD had _F508 and p.L375F mutations. The two children were heterozygous for the _F508 and p.L375F mutations, respectively. Mutation analysis of the CFTR gene should always be recommended for infertile couples seeking ICSI. The possibility of the children resulting from ICSI being a victim or carrier of CBAVD or CF, especially when the father is Caucasian with CBAVD, should be discussed during genetic counseling.",

    "abstract": "Genetic factors have a considerable influence on serum thyroid hormone levels. The C785T and A1814G polymorphisms, located in the 3' untranslated region of the type 1 deiodinase (D1) gene have been associated with serum FT4 and rT3 levels.\nIn healthy Danish twins, we examined the association of these polymorphisms with serum thyroid hormone levels and determined the proportion of genetic influence explained by these variants. We analysed the underlying functional mechanism by performing mRNA stability measurements and analysed the effect of these variants on D1 activity.\nSerum thyroid measurements and genotypes of the D1-C785T and D1-A1814G polymorphisms were determined in 1192 twins. Structural equation modelling was used to determine heritability estimates. Functional analyses were carried out in D1-transfected JEG3 cells.\nCarriers of the D1-785T allele had 3.8% higher FT4 and 14.3% higher rT3 levels, resulting in a lower T3/T4 and T3/rT3 ratio and a higher rT3/T4 ratio. This polymorphism explained 0.87% and 1.79%, respectively, of the variation in serum FT4 and rT3. The D1-A1814G polymorphism was not associated with serum thyroid hormone levels. No differences in D1 mRNA decay rate or D1 activity were observed between wild-type D1 and the two variants.\nThe D1-C785T polymorphism is consistently and significantly associated with serum thyroid hormone levels. However, the proportion of genetic influence explained by this particular polymorphism is small. No effect of the polymorphism on D1 mRNA decay rate or D1 activity was observed. The underlying functional mechanism needs to be elucidated.",

    "abstract": "To summarize our preliminary experience of selective feticide with bipolar coagulation in complicated monochorionic twins (MCT), and discuss the clinical application of feticide in discordant MCT.\nThree MCT with one twin anomaly, in which 2 had severe twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), stage IV, and 1 had acardiac twin, were identified in the second trimester of pregnancy. To terminate the abnormal twin and isolate the co-twin's circulation completely, selective feticide was performed by umbilical cord occlusion with bipolar coagulation under guidance of ultrasound and fetoscopy. After each invasive procedure, serial monitoring was performed, including procedural complications, Doppler of fetal middle cerebral artery and umbilical artery. Pregnancies were followed up every 2 weeks for fetal growth until delivery. After birth the placentas and the terminated fetuses were examined.\nCord occlusion was successfully accomplished in all 3 targeted fetuses, at 21, 22 and 24 weeks of gestation respectively. One case with TTTS was complicated with rupture of the membrane in the terminated fetus the 7th day after the procedure, and a healthy baby was born at 32 weeks. The other case with TTTS delivered a boy by cesarean section at 38 weeks. The third case with TRAP is at 35 weeks of gestations and under regular follow-up. Monochorionicity was confirmed by placental examination after delivery, and the effects of bipolar coagulation were observed at the cord of terminated fetuses.\nUmbilical cord occlusion with bipolar coagulation is an effective procedure for selective feticide in MCT with one twin anomaly. The outcome of normal fetus can be favorable.",

    "abstract": "We examined deliveries of twins to identify factors most strongly associated with an increased risk of transfusion. We reviewed the obstetric records of 511 twin deliveries at the Japanese Red Cross Katsushika Maternity Hospital from 2003 through 2007. After 18 (3.5%) of these deliveries, transfusions were required. Transfusion was significantly more likely after elective cesarean delivery at a gestational aged of 37 weeks or more (odds ratio, 4.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.87-12.61). Emergency cesarean delivery (at > or =37 weeks' gestation) was not associated with an increased risk of transfusion. The delivery mode of twins should be carefully considered because of the increased risk of transfusion after elective cesarean delivery at a gestational age of 37 weeks or more.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies are useful for investigating the causes of trait variation between as well as within a population. The goals of the present study were two-fold: First, we aimed to compare the total phenotypic, genetic and environmental variances of height, weight and BMI between Caucasians and East Asians using twins. Secondly, we intended to estimate the extent to which genetic and environmental factors contribute to differences in variability of height, weight and BMI between Caucasians and East Asians.\nHeight and weight data from 3735 Caucasian and 1584 East Asian twin pairs (age: 13-15 years) from Australia, China, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States were used for analyses. Maximum likelihood twin correlations and variance components model-fitting analyses were conducted to fulfill the goals of the present study.\nThe absolute genetic variances for height, weight and BMI were consistently greater in Caucasians than in East Asians with corresponding differences in total variances for all three body measures. In all 80 to 100% of the differences in total variances of height, weight and BMI between the two population groups were associated with genetic differences.\nHeight, weight and BMI were more variable in Caucasian than in East Asian adolescents. Genetic variances for these three body measures were also larger in Caucasians than in East Asians. Variance components model-fitting analyses indicated that genetic factors contributed to the difference in variability of height, weight and BMI between the two population groups. Association studies for these body measures should take account of our findings of differences in genetic variances between the two population groups.",

    "abstract": "Parenting twins is typically portrayed as more stressful than is parenting single children and, therefore, more of a strain on the marital relationship. With this in mind, the present study examined the contribution of infant characteristics and mother's internal resources (attachment style) and external resources (maternal and paternal grandmothers' perceived support) to their marital adaptation during the first month following delivery, comparing mothers of twins (n = 88) with mothers of singletons (n = 82). The findings indicate that both internal and external resources contribute to the marital adaptation of the two groups, even beyond the contribution of specific circumstances. Thus, it seems that the birth of twins and the birth of a single child are normative life events that have more in common than previously acknowledged. The implications for the focus of social work interventions, particularly in the case of the birth of twins, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Down syndrome detection rate at a 5% screen positive rate in first-trimester screening for twins.\nThis was a retrospective study from August 2005 to July 2007 of twins who underwent first-trimester screening with nuchal translucency, nasal bone, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, and free beta-hCG. Risks were calculated on the basis of the Fetal Medicine Foundation twin algorithm. The model simulated distributions of unaffected and affected cases at 12 weeks of gestation.\nTwo thousand ninety-four twin pregnancies (4188 fetuses) met the inclusion criteria. The addition of nasal bone to nuchal translucency, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, and free beta-hCG increased the Down syndrome detection rate from 79-89% at a 5% screen-positive rate.\nIn twins, first-trimester screening with nasal bone is valuable. The improved Down syndrome detection rate can help these high-risk patients with the decision-making process of whether to pursue invasive testing with its associated pregnancy loss risk.",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in parenting behaviors are due, in part, to genetic factors. In the present study, the authors sought to determine whether the degree of genetic influence varied according to the type of parental behavior under consideration. A population-based sample of 2,334 pairs of Finnish twins provided ratings on the physical affection, control, abusiveness, and indifference shown by their father and mother during childhood. Genetic influences, shared environmental influences, and nonshared environmental influences accounted for a small-to-medium proportion (17%-30%), a small-to-large proportion (22%-44%), and a medium-to-large proportion (37%-55%) of the variance in each parenting measure, respectively. There were no significant differences in effect sizes for mothers and fathers or across the 4 types of parental behavior. The genetic results may reflect characteristic styles with which parents respond to genetically influenced behaviors of individuals (gene-environment correlations) or individual perceptions of this relationship (gene-person correlation processes). The findings have implications for intervention and prevention work with families and for interpretation of evidence for interactions between genes and parenting behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is a harmful disease factor that develops unnoticed over time. The treatment of hypertension is aimed at an early diagnosis followed by adequate lifestyle changes rather than pharmacological treatment. The olive leaf extract EFLA943, having antihypertensive actions in rats, was tested as a food supplement in an open study including 40 borderline hypertensive monozygotic twins. Twins of each pair were assigned to different groups receiving 500 or 1000 mg/day EFLA943 for 8 weeks, or advice on a favourable lifestyle. Body weight, heart rate, blood pressure, glucose and lipids were measured fortnightly. Blood pressure changed significantly within pairs, depending on the dose, with mean systolic differences of < or =6 mmHg (500 mg vs control) and < or =13 mmHg (1000 vs 500 mg), and diastolic differences of < or =5 mmHg. After 8 weeks, mean blood pressure remained unchanged from baseline in controls (systolic/diastolic: 133 +/- 5/77 +/- 6 vs 135 +/- 11/80 +/- 7 mmHg) and the low-dose group (136 +/- 7/77 +/- 7 vs 133 +/- 10/76 +/- 7), but had significantly decreased for the high dose group (137 +/- 10/80 +/- 10 vs 126 +/- 9/76 +/- 6). Cholesterol levels decreased for all treatments with significant dose-dependent within-pair differences for LDL-cholesterol. None of the other parameters showed significant changes or consistent trends. Concluding, the study confirmed the antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering action of EFLA943 in humans.",

A well-conducted twin study is an excellent means to assess the relative contribution of heritability and environmental factors.\nMultiple sclerosis concordance was assessed for 10 Monozygotic and 14 dizygotic twin pairs using pairwise and probandwise concordance rates. The tetrachoric correlations in liability to disease for twin pairs were computed and a polygenic multifactorial model was used to estimate heritability.\nThe pairwise concordance for MZ twins was 30% and for the DZ twins 14.3%, compared with 30% for MZ and 0% for DZ 20 years ago. The corresponding probandwise concordance rates were 46.2% and 25%. The genetic variance (heritability) was 15.3% (95% Cl 0.0-77.6), the common environmental variance 73.7% (95% Cl 14.1-93.9) and the unique environmental variance 11.1% (95% Cl 2.3-30.0).\nAs the concordance of MS in DZ twins has increased during the past two decades and the heritability estimate is low, it seems that the reported increase in MS incidence in Finland is mainly caused by environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the potential for gene x environment interaction in hypertension by examining the extent to which educational attainment modifies the heritability of hypertension in male twins. Prior twin and family studies have established that hypertension runs in families and is heritable. In addition, epidemiological research indicates that the prevalence of hypertension differs by socioeconomic factors, such as educational attainment.\nTwin structural equation modeling was used to examine educational attainment as a moderator of heritability of hypertension. Participants were 4301 monozygotic and 3414 dizygotic male Vietnam-era twins who provided data on both education (in years) and self-report of physician diagnosis of hypertension or medication usage.\nHeritability was 17 points lower among co-twins concordant for educational attainment of < or =14 years (0.46, 95% CI = 0.32-0.57) relative to co-twins concordant for >14 years of education (0.63, 95% CI = 0.54-0.71). The significant moderation of the heritability (p = .04) was confirmed in twin models examining educational attainment as a continuous moderator of hypertension.\nThese results demonstrate that the expression of genetic vulnerability to hypertension can vary as a function of environmental factors, including education level, and that nongenetic pathways may differentially contribute to risk among those with fewer years of education.",

    "abstract": "Despite intense research, etiologies underlying syndromic craniosynostosis remain poorly understood. While syndrome-related genetic factors have garnered much attention, external forces likely play a large role as well. In contrast to well-defined genetic abnormalities that may be precisely identified and statistically quantified, characterization of more environmental factors has proven difficult. Much of this challenge stems from difficulty in isolating genetic components. However, in the event that 2 individuals share similar genetics, a clearer picture of external factors impacting phenotypic differences may be drawn. Because monozygotic discordant twins have identical genomes, the differences between affected and unaffected members are the result of the environment. Here, we discuss identical twin females who presented with Crouzon syndrome, as well as variations in craniosynostosis. In addition to highlighting the impact of nongenetic factors on craniosynostosis phenotype, we review several environmental elements that may have played a role in this unusual case.",

    "abstract": "Utilising data derived from twins and their families, different approaches can be applied to study genetic and environmental influences on human dental variation. The different methods have advantages and limitations and special features of the twinning process are important to consider. Model-fitting approaches have shown that different combinations of additive genetic variance (A), non-additive genetic variance (D), common environmental variance (C), and unique environmental variance (E) contribute to phenotypic variation within the dentition, reflecting different ontogenetic and phylogenetic influences. Epigenetic factors are also proposed as important in explaining differences in the dentitions of monozygotic co-twins. Heritability estimates are high for most tooth size variables, for Carabelli trait and for dental arch dimensions, moderate for intercuspal distances, and low for some occlusal traits. In addition to estimating the contributions of unmeasured genetic and environmental influences to phenotypic variation, structural equation models can also be used to test the effects of measured genetic and environmental factors. Whole-genome linkage analysis, association analysis of putative candidate genes, and whole genome association approaches, now offer exciting opportunities to locate key genes involved in human dental development.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative genetic studies revealed that not all of the phenotypic variance in PTC taste perception is heritable.\nTo study quantitative variations in PTC tasting ability in twins and to estimate heritability of PTC taste perception on the taste of twin data on males and females sexes separately.\nThe data for PTC taste sensitivity following the classic method of Harris & Kalmus (1949) were collected on a sample of 141 twin pairs (66 MZ and 75 DZ) and 275 singletons (128 males and 147 females) from Chandigarh, India. Genetic analyses were performed following Christian (1979), Donner (1986) and Sham (1998).\nFrequency of non-tasters was similar in twins (33 %) and singletons (32 %), but significant sex differences were observed. No differences were found between zygosities for mean thresholds. Similarly, no evidence of variance heterogeneity and environmental covariance was seen between zygosities. Since no basic assumption of the twin method was found violated, within-pair estimates of genetic variance would be unbiased. These estimates were highly significant in both males and females. However, dominance and additive components of genetic variance were found to differ between sexes.\nPTC thresholds do not seem to be significantly affected by environmental factors as no variance inequality was observed between twin zygosities. Intensity of bitterness (scalar dimensions) of PTC is a separate trait having no commonality with the genetic basis of recognition threshold for PTC tasting ability. The receptors recognizing bitter taste are different from the receptors determining intensity of taste. The absolute difference between co-twins in PTC thresholds can be used as a simple tool in the twin zygosity diagnosis. The results show that none of the MZ co-twins had manifested difference of more than 3 in their PTC threshold.",

    "abstract": "Treatment studies suggest that gambling-related irrational beliefs and attitudes (i.e., cognitive distortions (CDs)) contribute to the risk for problem gambling behavior. In a community sample of men, we investigated the associations among lifetime gambling-related CDs, psychiatric disorders other than pathological gambling , and problem gambling severity. Subjects were 1354 members of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Problem gambling and gambling-related CDs were derived from a 2002 interview using the National Opinion Research Center DSM-IV Screen for Gambling Problems (NODS). Exploratory factor analysis was performed with the 12 CD items to identify an underlying construct. Generalized linear models were computed to test for associations among CDs, psychiatric disorders other than pathological gambling, and gambling problem severity. Co-twin control analyses of monozygotic twin pairs discordant for problem gambling severity adjusted for genetic and shared environmental influences. Twelve CD items related to one underlying CD construct. After adjustment for lifetime psychiatric disorders, pathological gambling symptoms were positively associated with higher CD scores. Pathological gambling symptoms remained significantly associated with CD scores after controlling for genetic and shared environmental influence. These results provide empirical support for an association between gambling-related CDs and gambling problem severity, even after controlling for genetic and shared environmental influences and non-pathological gambling psychiatric disorders. Public health messages and therapeutic interventions that reinforce the randomness of gambling and draw attention to distorted thinking may prevent the development of problem gambling and improve treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is characterized by growth failure and dysmorphic features, and is frequently caused by hypomethylation of the paternally derived H19-DMR (epimutation). We observed 5 8/12-year-old female twins discordant for SRS. One twin exhibited SRS-compatible features, such as pre- and postnatal growth failure, relative macrocephaly, triangular face, left hemihypotrophy, and bilateral fifth finger clinodactyly, whereas the other twin showed apparently normal phenotype. Microsatellite analysis for 26 loci on multiple chromosomes showed monozygosity. Methylation analysis for the H19-DMR indicated epimutation in roughly half of cells in the affected twin and normal patterns in the unaffected twin and the parents. X-inactivation analysis revealed random X-inactivation with a nearly identical pattern between the twins. The discordant methylation pattern of the H19-DMR may primarily be due to a failure to maintain the DNA methyltransferase-1-dependent methylation imprint around the pre-implantation S phase, because such failure would result in the production of two different cell clones, one with normally methylated DMR and the other with demethylated DMR, leading to the separation of cells with different characters and resultant twinning.",

    "abstract": "A 29-year-old healthy woman bore monozygotic male twins at 37 weeks of gestation by cesarean section. They weighed 2,350 and 2,140 g, respectively. Twin B was found to have a ventricular septal defect. They were diagnosed with esophageal atresia (EA) with tracheoesophageal fistula and underwent primary end-to-end esophageal anastomosis at the age of 1 day. Their postoperative courses were uneventful. Although the incidence of EA is higher in twins than in singletons, usually, EA affects only one of twins. There have been only 20 pairs of twins concordant for the EA anomaly. There is no distinct difference between sporadic EA and EA in both twins (EABT) with regard to sexuality, classification, and incidence of associated anomalies. The zygosity of EABT consisted of 15 monozygosities (83.3%) and 3 dizygosities (16.7%). An overwhelmingly higher incidence of monozygosity than that of dizygosity in EABT suggests that genetic factors must play a considerable role in the embryology in EABT cases.",

    "abstract": "To describe an efficient, generalizable approach to validate probabilistic record linkage results, in particular by a model-guided detection of linking errors, and to apply this approach to validate linkage of admissions of newborns.\nOur double-blind validation procedure consisted of three steps: sample selection, data collection and data analysis. The linked Dutch national newborn admission registry contained 30,082 records for 2001 including readmissions (7.4%) and twins (9.7%). A highly informative sample was selected from the linked file by oversampling uncertain links based on model-derived linking weight. Four hundred and eight fax forms with minimal registry information (admissions of 191 children) were sent out to different pediatric units. The pediatricians were asked to create a short detailed patient history from independent sources. The linkage status and additional record data was validated against this external information.\nResponse rate was 97% (395/408 faxes). Accuracy of the linkage of singleton admissions was high: except for some expected errors in the uncertain area (0.02% of record pairs), linkage was error-free. Validation of multiple birth readmissions showed 37% linkage errors due to low data quality of the multiple birth variables. The quality of the linked registry file was still high; only 1.7% of the children were from a multiple birth with multiple admissions, resulting in less than 1% linking error.\nOur external validation procedure of record linkage was feasible, efficient, and informative about identifying the source of the errors.",

The quality of the linked registry file was still high; only 1.7% of the children were from a multiple birth with multiple admissions, resulting in less than 1% linking error.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) risk is determined by both genes and environment. One of the most striking features of MS is its geographic distribution, particularly the pattern of high MS frequency in areas with low sunlight exposure, the main inducer of vitamin D synthesis. Recent epidemiologic, experimental, and clinical evidence support an effect for low environmental supplies of vitamin D in mediating an increased susceptibility to MS.\nWe 1) examined the association of serum 25-hydroxy-vitaminD [25(OH)D] concentrations and MS status and 2) assessed the genetic contribution to serum 25(OH)D concentrations and tested for its association with genetic variants in 2 candidate genes [vitamin D receptor and 1-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1)].\nWe used a twin study approach, comprising adult pairs identified from the longitudinal population-based Canadian Collaborative Project on Genetic Susceptibility to MS. Monozygotic (MZ; n = 40) and dizygotic (DZ; n = 59) pairs, both concordant and discordant for MS, were studied. End-of-winter serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay, and genotypes were assessed by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay.\nSerum concentrations of 25(OH)D were highly correlated in MS-concordant pairs (r = 0.83, P < 0.001), but they were not significantly associated with having the disease (P = 0.4) when analyzed by logistic regression. Intraclass correlation for 25(OH)D concentration was significantly greater in MZ pairs (MZ, r: 0.71 > DZ r: 0.32, P = 0.006). Significant associations of 2 CYP27B1 SNP variants and 25(OH)D concentrations were observed.\nThe findings indicate important genetic influences on regulation of seasonal circulating 25(OH)D concentrations in MS twins.",

    "abstract": "Low birthweights as well as high perinatal mortality rates are common in most African populations. Little is known, however, about how low birthweight corresponds with higher mortality rates within African populations. Twins are known to have lower birthweights and higher perinatal mortality rates than singletons. If lower birthweights represent higher perinatal risk per se, small twins within a population with generally lower birthweights should have critically increased risks.\nIn total, 15,255 births in a Tanzanian hospital during 1999-2006 were analysed to determine birthweight distribution and examine perinatal mortality rates (including stillbirths and neonatal deaths within 24 hours) by birthweight in twins and singletons. Referral births from outside the district where the hospital was situated were excluded from analysis.\nThe mean birthweight for births within an estimated normal distribution was 3,172 g, with a standard deviation of 462 g. The overall perinatal mortality rate was 43.9 per 1,000 births (95% confidence interval: 40.7-47.2). Perinatal mortality rates among twins and singletons were 91.0 and 41.1 per 1000 babies respectively, corresponding to a relative risk of 2.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.7-2.8). The birthweight distribution for twins was shifted to lower birthweights. Twins had a generally lower birthweight and an excess of extremely small births as compared to singletons. The increased mortality rate for twins appeared to be independent of birthweight.\nThe two-fold increased risk of perinatal death for twins was observed across the whole birthweight distribution, and very small twins appeared to have an excess perinatal risk that was almost similar to that of larger twins.",

    "abstract": "Disorders affecting the postsynaptic side of the neuromuscular junction include autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG) as well as some of the congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS). Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an acquired autoimmune neuromuscular disorder in which autoantibodies are directed against the presynaptic calcium channels. Here we describe two monozygous twin brothers: case 1 was diagnosed with an indeterminate form of acquired postsynaptic neuromuscular junction defect at age 32 and case 2 with LEMS at age 47. Case 1 presented clinically with mild generalized myasthenic weakness, neurophysiological examination revealed disturbed neuromuscular transmission along with probable myositis and serum analysis regarding antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor and muscle-specific tyrosine kinase was negative. Case 2 presented with proximal muscle fatigue accompanied by areflexia at rest and antibodies against the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels were present. Neurophysiologically, case 2 had reduced baseline compound motor action potential amplitudes on neurography, decrement on low-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) and pathological increment on high frequency RNS. To our knowledge this is the first case report of its kind and adds an intriguing contrast to the more common diagnosis of CMS in monozygous twins.",

    "abstract": "It is currently not fully established whether human individuals have a genetically determined, individual-specific body odour. Volatile carboxylic acids are a key class of known human body odorants. They are released from glutamine conjugates secreted in axillary skin by a specific Nalpha-acyl-glutamine-aminoacylase present in skin bacteria. Here, we report a quantitative investigation of these odorant acids in 12 pairs of monozygotic twins. Axilla secretions were sampled twice and treated with the Nalpha-acyl-glutamine-aminoacylase. The released acids were analysed as their methyl esters with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry detection. The pattern of the analytes was compared with distance analysis. The distance was lowest between samples of the right and the left axilla taken on the same day from the same individual. It was clearly greater if the same subject was sampled on different days, but this intra-individual distance between samples was only slightly lower than the distance between samples taken from two monozygotic twins. A much greater distance was observed when comparing unrelated individuals. By applying cluster and principal component analyses, a clear clustering of samples taken from one pair of monozygotic twins was also confirmed. In conclusion, the specific pattern of precursors for volatile carboxylic acids is subject to a day-to-day variation, but there is a strong genetic contribution. Therefore, humans have a genetically determined body odour type that is at least partly composed of these odorant acids.",

    "abstract": "Anti-neoplastic treatments have significantly increased the survival of cancer patients, but female patients risk premature menopause. Oocyte cryopreservation has been proposed as a fertility-saving option. This report describes the first live birth achieved with autologous cryopreserved oocytes in an ovariectomized borderline cancer patient. A patient with a borderline ovarian tumour asked for oocyte cryopreservation after a right adnexectomy. Ovulation induction resulted in the retrieval and cryopreservation of seven mature oocytes. Thirty-nine months after a left ovariectomy, the patient asked for oocyte thawing and embryo transfer. Endometrial growth was induced using hormone replacement treatment. Three of the seven cryopreserved oocytes were thawed; they survived and, after insemination, normal fertilization took place. Three embryos were transferred into the patient's uterus. A twin pregnancy was achieved with the birth of two healthy females. Oocyte cryopreservation may be a reliable option for preserving fertility in young cancer patients who risk premature menopause due to surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of dental flossing on the microbial composition of interproximal plaque samples in matched twins.\nThe study was a two-treatment, examiner-masked, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study. Fifty-one twin pairs between 12 and 21 years of age were randomized to a 2-week supervised and unsupervised treatment regimen consisting of tongue brushing and toothbrushing or tongue brushing and toothbrushing plus flossing. The reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay was used to assess levels (abundance) of 26 microbial species in interproximal plaque samples collected from six sites per subject. An integrative computational predictive model estimated average changes in microbial abundance patterns of selected bacterial species from baseline to 2 weeks by comparing treatment groups.\nAfter the 2-week study period, putative periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria were overabundant in the group that did not floss compared to the group that performed flossing. Those included Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Prevotella intermedia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and Streptococcus mutans. Microbial species that are not consistent with the development of periodontal disease or dental caries were overabundant in the group that did floss compared to the non-flossing group.\nIn a well-matched twin cohort, tooth and tongue brushing plus flossing significantly decreased the abundance of microbial species associated with periodontal disease and dental caries after a 2-week program.",

    "abstract": "The report of 2 cases and review of the literature.\nTo report the cases of a pair of female monozygotic (high-class athletes) twins discordant for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.\nThe relation between scoliosis and exercising is rather unclear. The latter has often been considered both as a therapeutic means and a causative factor of the former. The existence of genetic predisposition in the development of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is commonly accepted. According to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a pair of female monozygotic (high-class athletes) twins, discordant for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. METHODS.: A pair of 13.5-year-old female monozygotic twins, high-class level athletes of synchronized swimming, was clinically examined during a school screening program. Both girls were observed in the standing erect position for asymmetries of the lateral contours of the trunk, shoulders, and scapulas and their limb's length was measured. The \"forward bending test\" was performed to determine the existence of rib hump asymmetry.\nOne of the sisters was considered to be suspicious of suffering from scoliosis. The radiologic evaluation that followed confirmed the existence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (left thoracolumbar curve of 32 degrees as measured by the Cobb angle). The clinical and radiologic evaluation of her sibling failed to reveal the existence of any spinal deformity.\nAdolescent idiopathic scoliosis seems to be a multifactorial skeletal disorder. The role of exercising and heredity in its development remain controversial.",

Angiotensin II is an angiogenic factor and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent retinal neovascularisation and their use in preventing proliferative retinopathy of prematurity has been suggested. We report on twin girls born after 32 gestational weeks, who were exposed to blockage of the RAS during gestation, had severely reduced retinal vasculature and developed severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) despite receiving very little extra oxygen.\nIt is likely that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers not only reduce pathological neovascularisation but also normal vascularisation of the eyes and other organs.",

Previous studies have shown an increased risk for cigarette smokers but no accounts for the timing of exposure to smoking relative to appendectomy were made.\nBased on questionnaire data, both cohort and co-twin case-control analyses were conducted to assess the effect of active cigarette smoking on appendectomy in 3808 Australian twin pairs. Smoking status was defined as a time-dependent covariate to account for differences in timing of smoking initiation and onset of appendicitis.\nThe questionnaire had a 65% pairwise response rate. After controlling for sex, age, and year of birth, appendectomy risk in current smokers was statistically significantly increased by 65% relative to never-smokers. This was largely unchanged by the duration or intensity of smoking and was not affected by socioeconomic status or father's occupation. The effect was stronger in females. Among former smokers, increased time since quitting significantly reduced the odds ratio of appendectomy by 15% for every year since quitting.\nAfter adjustment for age and other confounders, there was an increase in risk of appendectomy among current smokers relative to never-smokers, particularly in females.

Peripheral blood DNA was tested for X-chromosome inactivation (methylation) patterns of the X-linked human androgen receptor gene, comparing the twins' patterns to parental. Twin A showed nonrandom inactivation skewed toward the paternal X, whereas twin B showed random X-inactivation.

    "abstract": "Male monozygotic twins with genetically determined severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy are described. Although seizure onset, clinical seizure symptomatology, and motor and mental development were almost identical until age 38 months, their clinical courses then became discordant. The emergence of myoclonus was delayed by 12 months in twin 1 compared with twin 2. Regression in language development, which is a common feature of severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy, was obvious in twin 2 after the emergence of myoclonus, whereas twin 1 did not demonstrate any regression. The clinical-course discordance between twins was attributable to bacterial meningitis, which twin 1 developed at age 35 months. Bacterial meningitis may have affected the clinical course of severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy in twin 1, resulting in delayed onset of myoclonus and more favorable language development in twin 1 than in twin 2, who did not experience bacterial meningitis.",

    "abstract": "Multiple pregnancies in assisted reproduction can be regarded as iatrogenic and avoidable, given that the phenomenon is related to the number of embryos replaced. Prospective studies have shown that transferring one fresh embryo and subsequently one frozen embryo gives similar cumulative pregnancy rates to transferring two fresh embryos. However, the multiple pregnancy rates differ significantly between the two strategies. In Trondheim, elective double embryo transfer (eDET) was introduced in September 1991. Prior to that, multiple pregnancy rates were nearly 35% and the triplet rate was 7%. The triplet rate dropped to below 1%, but the twin rate still remained high. In 2002, it was decided to start elective single embryo transfer (eSET) and currently SET is performed in more than 90% of in-vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. The inclusion criteria are nearly as simple as: 'If you have two good embryos, you get only one embryo at a time'. Multiple pregnancy rates are well below 10% and there are no triplets. In conclusion, triplet rates can be reduced to zero and twin rates to below 10% by eSET. The cumulative pregnancy rate per oocyte recovery is not reduced, including replacement of frozen- thawed embryos.",

    "abstract": "Two studies have reported decreased intensity dependence of the P2 event-related potential (ERP) in male combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a response pattern presumed to reflect central nervous system-induced protective inhibition and heightened central serotonergic activity. We used an identical twin, case-control design to investigate whether intensity dependence abnormalities reflect pretrauma vulnerability or are an acquired consequence of PTSD. ERPs were measured in male Vietnam combat veterans and their noncombat-exposed monozygotic twin brothers during a four-tone, stimulus-intensity modulation procedure. Contrary to previous findings in male veterans, the PTSD group had significantly steeper P2 amplitude intensity slopes, similar to those reported for female veterans and abused children with PTSD. Additionally, increased P2 amplitude intensity slope was associated with increased PTSD symptom severity, particularly the severity of reexperiencing symptoms. A mixed-model, random-effects analysis that included the combat-unexposed twins revealed a significant diagnosis by combat exposure interaction. Inspection of group means suggests that the observed increased P2 intensity dependence is a consequence of PTSD. Our findings further suggest that low serotonergic tone may emerge as one potential consequence of this disorder.",

    "abstract": "To determine the diabetes- and obesity-related risks for surgically managed stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.\nThis twin cohort study used the Swedish Twin Register to identify 8,443 female twin pairs born from 1926 through 1958. The association between diabetes and pelvic floor surgery was estimated while taking into account the correlated (twin) structure of the data.\nFor type 1 and type 2 diabetes, no significant associations were observed for stress urinary incontinence (odds ratio [OR] 1.0 [95% CI 0.1-9.2] and 2.0 [1.0-4.0], respectively). There were no cases of prolapse surgery in type 1 diabetic subjects, and for type 2 diabetes the risk estimate was nonsignificant (1.6 [1.0-2.7]). BMI >25 kg/m(2), age >or=60 years, and childbirth were the strongest risk factors for having incontinence surgery.\nOur data suggest that diabetes is not associated with stress urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse surgery.",

Amniocentesis (at 13(5/7) weeks) was performed following ultrasound signs of hydrops and cystic hygroma in twin 1 (T1). Prenatal karyotype showed non-mosaic trisomy 21 in T1 (47,XX,+21[7]), and low-grade mosaic trisomy 21 in twin 2 (T2) (47,XX,+21[2]/46,XX[19]). Post mortem examination of fetal skin, kidneys and lungs confirmed trisomy 21 in T1 (47,XX,+21[548]) and the placenta (47,XX,+21[200]). T2 had a normal karyotype (46,XX[648]). Analysis of microsatellite polymorphisms in multiple samples from the placenta, hand, lungs, kidneys and the umbilical cords of both twins confirmed monozygosity for all loci tested, and trisomy 21 in T1. Unexpectedly, T1 and T2 inherited different maternal alleles for markers of the most distal 4 Mbp of 21q. At least four successive events are needed to explain the genetic status of both twins and include maternal MI premature chromatids separation or maternal II meiotic nondisjunction and post-zygotic events such as, chromosome rescue, nondisjunction, an/or recombination.",

    "abstract": "Proteus syndrome is a rare, complex disorder predominantly characterized by asymmetric overgrowth of body parts, connective tissue and epidermal nevi, and vascular malformations. General diagnostic criteria comprise mosaic distribution, sporadic occurrence, and progressive course. We report on Proteus syndrome in discordant monozygotic twins. The affected 9-year-old boy showed progressive postnatal overgrowth of his right leg and foot and asymmetric progressive overgrowth of single toes with a small cerebriform connective tissue nevus on his right fourth toe. The progressive course was documented by serial photographs over a period of 3 years. Twin monozygosity was determined by PCR-amplified short tandem repeat (STR) analysis, revealing complete concordance of all alleles in both twins. This observation, to our knowledge, is only the second case report of discordant Proteus syndrome in monozygotic twins. This supports the hypothesis that this rare condition is caused by a postzygotic mutational event resulting in mosaicism.",

    "abstract": "Migraine headache (with and without aura) is common in the general population and is known to be influenced by genetic factors with heritability estimates between 34-57%. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a hypercoagulable state characterized by clinical features including venous and arterial thromboses, pregnancy loss and migraine, and by association with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Numerous small studies have investigated whether aPL are associated with migraine in the general population--with contradictory results. In this study, the question was addressed by studying the prevalence of aPL in members of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs differing in their migraine status. Such twins provide a unique natural experiment, matched as they are for age, sex and genetic factors, and allow the role of environmental factors, such as aPL, to be determined. Despite 95% power to detect a difference of 0.59 IgG units per litre in anticardiolipin antibody IgG titres, no difference in prevalence of aPL could be detected in migraine-discordant MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "A growing number of studies have suggested a link between social capital and health. However, the association may reflect confounding by factors, such as personality or early childhood environment, that are unmeasured prior common causes of both social capital and health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of social capital on physical and mental health among adult twins in the U.S.\nA cross-sectional national survey of twins within the National Survey of Midlife Development in the U.S. (MIDUS), 1995--1996 was analyzed in 2007. The study population included 944 twin pairs (37.2% monozygotic [MZ] and 62.8% dizygotic [DZ]). Data were obtained on individual-level social capital variables (social trust, sense of belonging, volunteer activity, and community participation); health outcomes (perceived physical and mental health, depressive symptoms and major depression); and individual covariates (age, gender, race, education, working status, and marital status). A fixed-effects model was used to examine health status among twin pairs who were discordant on levels of social capital.\nIn the individual data analysis, social trust, sense of belonging, and community participation were each significantly associated with health outcomes. In the fixed-effects model, physical health remained significantly positively associated with social trust among MZ and DZ twins. However, major depression was not associated with social capital.\nThe present study is the first to find the independent positive effect of social trust on self-rated physical health using fixed-effects models of twin data. The results suggest that the association between social capital and physical health status is not explained by unobserved confounds, such as personality or early childhood environment.",

We report a case of hematopoietic chimerism in a pair of 27-year-old dizygotic twins who each had a mixture of 46,XX and 46,XY blood lymphocytes, both with 98% male (XY) lymphocytes and 2% female (XX) lymphocytes. Analysis of telomere length by T/C FISH revealed that the female twin generally had longer telomeres than the male twin. Moreover, in the male sibling, the telomeres within the female lymphocytes were shortened to 87% of their original length, while the telomeres within the male lymphocytes were 33% longer in the female sibling. Thus, telomere length attrition in peripheral lymphocytes is determined mainly by the environment of the cell and less by intracellular factors.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the regulation and metabolic effects of TCF7L2 gene expression in human sc fat and skeletal muscle and the impact of the TCF7L2, rs7903146, T-allele on gene expression and measures of glucose metabolism including insulin secretion and peripheral and hepatic insulin action.\nThe rs7903146 was genotyped in 1) a population-based sample of 587 twins (55-64 yr) with glucose tolerance ranging from normal to type 2 diabetes and 2) a population of 196 nondiabetic young (22-31 yr) and elderly (57-66 yr) twins. All subjects underwent oral glucose tolerance tests, and population 2 was additionally examined with iv glucose tolerance tests and hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamps.\nElderly T-allele carriers had decreased plasma insulin responses and lower disposition index, whereas insulinogenic index was similar between genotype groups. Elderly nondiabetic T-allele carriers had increased peripheral insulin sensitivity (P = 0.03). Young T-allele carriers had impaired hepatic insulin sensitivity (P = 0.04) independent of plasma insulin levels. TCF7L2 gene expression in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue was not explained by genotype, sex, aerobic capacity, birth, or adult anthropometry and was not associated with in vivo glucose metabolism.\nThe rs7903146 T-allele associates with hepatic insulin resistance and diminished glucose-stimulated plasma insulin secretion. Our study does not provide evidence of a role of TCF7L2 gene expression in sc fat tissue and muscle tissue in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. This suggests that the primary defect of rs7903146 T-allele carriers is impairment of insulin secretion rather than a defect in insulin action in peripheral tissues.",

    "abstract": "To clarify the relationship between depression and heart rate variability (HRV) in a sample of twins. Reduced HRV, a measure of autonomic dysfunction, has been linked to depression but many studies have inadequately controlled for familial and environmental factors. Furthermore, little is known about whether depression and HRV share common genetic pathways.\nWe performed power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms in 288 middle-aged male twins. Log-normalized ultra low, very low, low, high frequency, and total power were calculated. A lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD) was determined, using the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders, and current depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory. Mixed-effect regression models were used to account for intrapair variability and estimate within-pair effects at the same time controlling for potential confounders.\nBoth current depressive symptoms and a history of MDD were significantly associated with lower HRV. There was a graded effect, and power in each frequency band was 29% to 36% lower in the lowest band compared with the highest BDI category. All HRV measures except high frequency remained significantly associated with current depressive symptoms in multivariable analysis, but not with lifetime history of MDD. When analyses were stratified by zygosity, a significant within-pair association between BDI score and HRV was found in the dizygotic but not in the monozygotic twins, suggesting a genetic influence on the association.\nA shared, genetically influenced biological pathway underlies the association between depression and lower HRV. These two phenotypes may be the expression of a generalized neurobiological perturbation.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have suggested that bifocal and progressive spectacles can reduce progression of myopia in esophoric children. This study compared myopic progression with bifocal (BSCL) and single vision soft contact lenses (SVSCL) in identical twins with near point esophoria.\nTwo 12-year-old myopic girls were randomly assigned to wear either BSCL or SVSCL for one year using a double-masked design. Both twins then wore BSCLs for another year. Ocular measurements included cycloplegic and manifest refractions, corneal curvature and axial length. Distance and near phorias were measured through distance corrections and near associated phorias, with both types of contact lenses.\nThrough their SVSCLs, both children exhibited near associated esophorias, which were neutralised by the BSCLs. The child wearing SVSCLs over the first year showed significant myopic progression, increasing -1.19 D (binocular average), while the child wearing BSCLs showed no progression (+0.13 D). The latter child showed limited progression (-0.28 D) over the second year, while switching from SVSCLs to BSCLs arrested progression in the other child (+0.44 D after one year). Axial length data were consistent with the refractive findings; the child exhibiting more myopia at the end of the first 12 months of the study had longer eyes (by 0.64 mm) than her sister, although their corneas also had steepened more (by 0.44 D compared to 0.18 D). The children showed minimal changes [corrected] in eye size over the second year when both wore BSCLs (binocular averages: -0.05, -0.09 [corrected] mm, respectively).\nThe apparent inhibitory effect of BSCLs on myopic progression reported in this twin study argues for further study of their efficacy as a control treatment for myopes with near esophoria.",

The clinical phenotypes were as follows: one out of the two twins suffered from insulinoma and hyperparathyroidism, while the second one was asymptomatic. Furthermore, the mother suffered from hyperparathyroidism, as well as from hypergastrinemia for several years before the daughter was diagnosed of MEN-1.\nWe describe a family with a new heterozygous mutation (g.292delC) in the MEN1 gene not described previously.

    "abstract": "Little is known of the onset of breast cancer in high-risk populations. We investigated the risk of breast cancer in twin sisters and in the contralateral breast taking family history into consideration.\nWe analyzed a Scandinavian population-based cohort of 2,499 female twin pairs, in which at least one had a diagnosis of breast cancer and estimated the risk of breast cancer in the sister. Using a total of 11 million individuals in Sweden with complete family links, we identified 93,448 women with breast cancer and estimated the risk of a bilateral breast cancer.\nThe incidence of breast cancer in twin sisters of breast cancer patients was 0.64% per year and 0.42% per year in mono- and dizygotic twin sisters, respectively. In comparison, the risk of familial (affected first-degree relative) and nonfamilial bilateral breast cancer was 1.03% per year and 0.68% per year, respectively. Contrary to the risk of unilateral disease, the risk of cancer in the nonaffected twin and the opposite breast was not affected by age or time since first event. The relative risk of familial bilateral cancer was 52% higher (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.52; 95% CI, 1.42 to 1.64) and the relative risk in the dizygotic twin sister was 25% lower (IRR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.91) compared with the risk of nonfamilial bilateral cancer.\nThe elevated risk of breast cancer in high-risk groups is little affected by age and time since diagnosis. Our findings suggest that susceptible groups of women might have already aggregated genetic prerequisites for breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Chromogranin A (CHGA) triggers catecholamine secretory granule biogenesis, and its catestatin fragment inhibits catecholamine release. We approached catestatin heritability using twin pairs, coupled with genome-wide linkage, in a series of twin and sibling pairs from 2 continents.\nHypertensive patients had elevated CHGA coupled with reduction in catestatin, suggesting diminished conversion of precursor to catestatin. Heritability for catestatin in twins was 44% to 60%. Six hundred fifteen nuclear families yielded 870 sib pairs for linkage, with significant logarithm of odds peaks on chromosomes 4p, 4q, and 17q. Because acidification of catecholamine secretory vesicles determines CHGA trafficking and processing to catestatin, we genotyped at positional candidate ATP6N1, bracketed by peak linkage markers on chromosome 17q, encoding a subunit of vesicular H(+)-translocating ATPase. The minor allele diminished CHGA secretion and processing to catestatin. The ATP6N1 variant also influenced blood pressure in 1178 individuals with the most extreme blood pressure values in the population. In chromaffin cells, inhibition of H(+)-ATPase diverted CHGA from regulated to constitutive secretory pathways.\nWe established heritability of catestatin in twins from 2 continents. Linkage identified 3 regions contributing to catestatin, likely novel determinants of sympathochromaffin exocytosis. At 1 such positional candidate (ATP6N1), variation influenced CHGA secretion and processing to catestatin, confirming the mechanism of a novel trans-QTL for sympathochromaffin activity and blood pressure.",

    "abstract": "The otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) measured in a collection of special populations of humans and certain nonhuman species suggest that OAEs may provide a window into some processes of human prenatal development and sexual differentiation. For reasons that are unclear, OAEs appear to be highly sensitive to events occurring during prenatal development that seem to be related to the degree of exposure to androgens a fetus receives. The (largely circumstantial) evidence for a relationship between androgen exposure and OAE strength comes from a series of studies of twins, children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, people of differing sexual orientations, and spotted hyenas, among others. Some conclusions are bolstered by parallel studies using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). OAEs and AEPs are simple, objective, noninvasive measures that appear to have potential as tools of value to researchers working on a wide variety of basic and applied topics beyond audition.",

    "abstract": "Genetic and environmental factors are known to contribute to cannabis abuse/dependence (CAD). We sought to determine the magnitude of the contribution from measured environmental variables to offspring cannabis dependence in a design that controls for familial vulnerability. Data come from a study of 725 twin members of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, 720 of their biological offspring (age 18-32 years) and 427 mothers. Data were obtained on offspring perception of family and peer support and substance use behaviors and offspring CAD. After adjusting for familial risk, and environmental covariates, CAD was significantly more likely among male offspring (OR=2.73; 95% CI: 1.69-4.41). Offspring CAD was associated with reporting: siblings used illicit drugs (OR=3.40; 95% CI: 1.81-6.38), a few friends used drugs (OR=2.72; 95% CI: 1.04-7.09), a quarter or more friends used drugs (OR=8.30; 95% CI: 3.09-22.33) and one-half or more 12th grade peers used drugs (OR=3.17; 95% CI: 1.42-7.08). Perceived sibling, friend and school peer substance use are strongly associated with CAD in young adults even after accounting for latent familial risk and for multiple measured intra-family and extra-family environmental influences.",

Case 1 was never given the chance for donor oocytes since she was rejected by a majority vote of our physicians because of the fear of a malpractice suit.\nIf a couple understands the potential risks and the low odds of success, they should be given the opportunity to fulfill their dreams of having a baby.

    "abstract": "The smoking behavior of friends is a major risk factor for adolescent smoking uptake. To explore the social context of smoking experimentation and consolidation with a particular focus on friends, the authors interviewed both members of 14 young adult identical twin pairs who were discordant for smoking. The different smoking status of twins was connected to their different friendship groups and development of different identities. Smoking respondents gravitated to the behaviors and images of the peer group who smoked. Many nonsmokers felt strong pressure from their peers not to smoke and spoke about how the images conveyed by smoking were inconsistent with their peer group's image. Adolescents and young adults are aware of the messages that smoking can convey to others and exploit these images to construct a social identity.",

    "abstract": "To analyze dizygotic twinning rates and outcomes over a 25-year period.\nBirth and fetal death certificates from 1980-2004 in Washington State, USA, were analyzed retrospectively to find factors associated with the increase in sex-discordant twins through time. \"Low\" and \"high\" fertility treatment groups were defined according to demographic traits. Perinatal mortality was defined as fetal or neonatal death of one or both twins and Weinberg's rule was used to estimate mortality for monozygotic and dizygotic pairs.\nControlling simultaneously for maternal age, race, parity, and education did not eliminate the trend of increasing sex-discordant twins from 1992-2004 (M-H chi2 P=0.001). The \"low\" fertility group had a non-significant decline in sex-discordant twins (M-H chi2 P=0.24), whereas the \"high\" fertility group had a significant increase (M-H chi2 P=0.001). Perinatal mortality decreased for monozygtic twin pairs throughout the study period, but decreased until the mid-1990s and then increased slightly through 2004 for the dizygotic twin pairs.\nAdvancing maternal age and increasing use of fertility treatments are largely responsible for the increase in dizygotic twins from 1980-2004 and may also be responsible for the stalling of the decline in perinatal mortality rate.",

    "abstract": "It is generally believed that monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies result from one fertilized oocyte with both siblings having the same genotype and phenotype. In rare instances, due to somatic mutations or chromosome aberrations, the karyotypes and phenotypes of the two twins can differ.\nWe report cytogenetic, molecular genetic and clinical examinations in monochorionic-diamniotic twins discordant in gender.\nThe monochorionic-diamniotic status of the twins was diagnosed by ultrasound and histologic examination of the placenta. Prenatal chromosome examination performed on amniocytes revealed a normal female karyotype in one and a 46,XX(26)/46,XY(3) karyotype in the other twin. Molecular examinations confirmed monozygosity despite discordant sex. Based on the cytogenetic and molecular results of lymphocytes and placental cells, the only explanation for gender discordance was that the conceptus originally had a 47,XXY chromosome complement.\nA 47,XXY zygote appears to have undergone a twinning process. A postzygotic loss of the X chromosome in some cells and the Y chromosome in other cells, either before or after twinning, resulted in 46,XX/46,XY mosaicism in both monozygotic (MZ) twins. The sex discordance of the MZ twins can be explained by different proportions of the 46,XX and 46,XY cell lines in the gonads and other tissues.",

Monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for overweight offer a unique opportunity to examine these factors.\nMZ male (n=8 pairs) and female twins (n=10 pairs) discordant for overweight (defined as the BMI of one twin being at least 24.5, and the BMI of his/her co-twin being below 24.5 and at least three points lower) were identified from the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry. Variables were assessed via self-report questionnaires.\nOne overweight and two non-overweight females met criteria for bulimia nervosa. Rates of dieting and binge eating were high among all males and females. Hunger scores were higher among non-overweight females; disinhibition scores were higher among overweight males. Only one non-overweight and three overweight males smoked; 90% of non-overweight and 40% of overweight females smoked.\nAssessing tobacco use and eating disorders may be important when sampling on the basis of family members who are discordant for BMI.

    "abstract": "Female carriers of haemophilia B are usually asymptomatic; however, the disease resulting from different pathophysiological mechanisms has rarely been documented in females. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for haemophilia B in fraternal female twins. We sequenced the factor IX gene (F9) of the propositus, her father, a severe haemophilia B patient and the other family members. X chromosome inactivation was assessed by the methylation-sensitive HpaII-PCR assay using X-linked polymorphisms in human phosphoglycerate kinase 1 gene (PGK1) and glutamate receptor ionotropic AMPA 3 gene (GRIA3). The twins were found to be heterozygotes with a nonsense mutation (p.Arg384X) inherited from their father. The propositus, more severely affected twin, exhibited a significantly higher percentage of inactivation in the maternally derived X chromosome carrying a normal F9. The other twin also showed a skewed maternal X inactivation, resulting in a patient with mild haemophilia B. Thus, the degree of skewing of maternal X inactivation is closely correlated with the coagulation parameters and the clinical phenotypes of the twins. Furthermore, we identified a crossing-over in the Xq25-26 region of the maternal X chromosome of the more severely affected twin. This crossing-over was absent in the other twin, consistent with their fraternal state. Differently skewed X inactivation in the fraternal female twins might cause moderately severe and mild haemophilia B phenotypes, respectively.",

    "abstract": "There is still uncertainty about the relative importance of genes and environments on human sexual orientation. One reason is that previous studies employed self-selected, opportunistic, or small population-based samples. We used data from a truly population-based 2005-2006 survey of all adult twins (20-47 years) in Sweden to conduct the largest twin study of same-sex sexual behavior attempted so far. We performed biometric modeling with data on any and total number of lifetime same-sex sexual partners, respectively. The analyses were conducted separately by sex. Twin resemblance was moderate for the 3,826 studied monozygotic and dizygotic same-sex twin pairs. Biometric modeling revealed that, in men, genetic effects explained .34-.39 of the variance, the shared environment .00, and the individual-specific environment .61-.66 of the variance. Corresponding estimates among women were .18-.19 for genetic factors, .16-.17 for shared environmental, and 64-.66 for unique environmental factors. Although wide confidence intervals suggest cautious interpretation, the results are consistent with moderate, primarily genetic, familial effects, and moderate to large effects of the nonshared environment (social and biological) on same-sex sexual behavior.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this survey was to study anxiety and associated factors in the mothers of twins or triplets as compared with the mothers of singleton children.\nThe subjects were 130 mothers of twins or triplets aged 3 or under and 860 mothers of similarly aged singleton children. The Japanese version of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to evaluate their anxiety states.\n1. Mothers of twins or triplets showed significantly higher STAI state anxiety scores than those of singleton children. However, there was no significant difference in STAI trait anxiety between mothers with twins or triplets and those with singleton children. 2. Mothers of twins or triplets showed greater anxiety during pregnancy than those of singleton children. There were also higher rates of cases where stress could not be alleviated in mothers of twins or triplets than in those with singleton children. STAI state anxiety of mothers was associated with anxiety during pregnancy, anxiety for future child-rearing, problems with stress alleviation, maternal health conditions, poor sleeping conditions and having siblings.\nThis study indicated a tendency for mothers of twins or triplets to show greater anxiety as compared with those having singleton children. It is important to improve the child-rearing environment to reduce anxiety felt by mothers of twins or triplets.",

    "abstract": "The present analyses aimed to test the prediction that schizophrenia patients and their non-schizophrenic co-twins would display reduced efficiency of the neurocognitive mechanisms subserving active maintenance of spatial information in working memory.\nUpper alpha frequency band EEG event-related desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS) were calculated as percent changes in power relative to an inter-trial baseline across 4 memory loads in a spatial delayed-response task.\nDuring the delay, the diagnostic groups showed equivalent ERD/ERS activity over posterior scalp regions at the lowest memory load; however, as memory load increased, patients, and to an intermediate degree, their non-schizophrenic co-twins (monozygotic and dizygotic pairs collapsed together), showed significantly greater increases in ERD/ERS amplitude as compared with controls.\nThese findings demonstrate abnormally increased ERD/ERS amplitudes with increasing memory load in patients with schizophrenia and their co-twins, consistent with inefficiency of the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting active maintenance of information across a delay.",

    "abstract": "Variation in the level of gene expression is a major determinant of a cell's function and characteristics. Common allelic variants of genes can be expressed at different levels and thus contribute to phenotypic diversity. We have measured allelic expression differences at heterozygous loci in monozygotic twins and in unrelated individuals. We show that the extent of differential allelic expression is highly similar within monozygotic twin pairs for many loci, implying that allelic differences in gene expression are under genetic control. We also show that even subtle departures from equal allelic expression are often genetically determined.",

    "abstract": "This longitudinal study examined the contribution of infants' temperament, mother's attachment style, and perceived grandmother's support following delivery, to the psychological mental health and marital adaptation of first time and non-first time Israeli mothers of pre-term (n = 70) and full-term (n = 78) twins, a year later. We collected data for the current study over 2 years (2003-2004). The findings suggested that the extent of mothers' personal and familial stress and their internal resource of attachment style played a crucial role in their mental health and marital adaptation. The external resource of grandmother's support contributed directly to the mothers' marital adaptation, whereas it contributed to their mental health only when infant's temperament was perceived to be difficult. Interestingly, the association between stress and adaptation was stronger among mothers of full-term twins than mothers of pre-term twins. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "To assess the feasibility and impact on perinatal outcome of fetoscopic laser coagulation of placental anastomoses in monochorionic twins with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) and intermittent absent or reversed end-diastolic flow (iAREDF) in the umbilical artery (Type III), in comparison with expectant management.\nThis is a descriptive study of the outcome of 18 cases of monochorionic twins with Type III sIUGR treated with laser, and 31 pregnancies managed expectantly over the same period. All newborns underwent neonatal brain ultrasound scans. Perinatal outcome and the incidence of neurological damage were compared between the two groups.\nLaser coagulation could be performed in only 88.9% (16/18) of cases owing to technical difficulties, and in 12.5% (2/16) a second procedure was required to achieve complete coagulation of the large artery-to-artery anastomosis. Mean gestational age at delivery was 31.0 (range, 26-33) weeks in the expectant management group and 32.6 (range, 23-38) weeks in the laser group (P = 0.32). Overall perinatal survival was 85.5% (53/62) and 63.9% (23/36), respectively (P = 0.02). Intrauterine demise of the smaller twin occurred in 19.4% (6/31) and 66.7% (12/18), respectively (P = 0.001), and was associated with death of the cotwin in 50% (3/6) and 0% (0/12) of these cases, respectively (P = 0.02). The prevalence of periventricular leukomalacia in the larger fetus was 4/28 (14.3%) in the expectant management group and 1/17 (5.9%) in the laser group (P = 0.63).\nLaser coagulation in sIUGR-iAREDF pregnancies is technically difficult and not always feasible. Placental dichorionization significantly increases the proportion of fetuses with intrauterine death of the growth-restricted twin, but it protects the normal twin from its cotwin's death in the event of demise of the growth-restricted twin.",

    "abstract": "We present the case of a monozygotic twin pregnancy discordant for phenotype and karyotype. A chorionic villus sample was performed at the 11th week of gestation in a primigravida because of cystic hygroma detected by ultrasound in one twin of a monochorionic, biamniotic pregnancy. Rapid testing by means of quantitative fluorescence polymerase chain reaction and conventional karyotyping, obtained by both short- and long-term culture, revealed a homogeneous monosomy X (45,X). Amniocentesis was performed separately for both twins before termination and showed an homogeneous monosomy X in one sample and a 46,X,del(X)(p11.1) karyotype in the other one. Postmortem fetal tissues culture confirmed the discordant karyotype between the two embryos. Placental samples obtained after termination revealed the cell line which was not detected at chorionic villus sampling. Based on this and previous reports, we suggest that in cases of a phenotypic discordance detected at ultrasound in the first trimester, it is advisable to perform a karyotype analysis on amniocytes because it better reflects fetal constitution rather than chorionic villi or lymphocytes in case of heterokaryotipic monosomy X monochorionic twins.",

    "abstract": "Recent molecular genetic studies provide suggestive evidence for sexual dimorphism in genetics of obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, only a few twin studies have addressed the question of sex differences in genetic and environmental contributions to variation of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The aim of the present study was to estimate genetic and environmental influences on obsessive-compulsive symptoms in South Korean twins, with a special emphasis on sex difference. In total, 751 adolescent and young adult twin pairs (ages: 13-23 years) completed a Korean version of the 30 items of the Maudsley Obsessional - Compulsive Inventory (MOCI) through a mail survey. A sum of the answers for the 30 items was calculated to represent a total score for obsessive-compulsive symptoms (hereafter, the MOCIT). Males had significantly higher variance of the MOCIT than did females. In males, monozygotic (MZ) twin correlation was significantly higher than dizygotic (DZ) twin correlations (.56 vs. .24), whereas in females, MZ and DZ twin correlations were not significantly different from each other (.39 vs. .36). The general sex-limitation model was applied to the twin data. The results of model-fitting analyses indicated that the unstandardized genetic variance as well as heritability estimate (53% vs. 41%) for the MOCIT was higher in males than in females. However, shared environmental influences did not attain statistical significance perhaps due to insufficient statistical power.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported that prevalence estimates, symptom presentation, and sociocultural risk and protective factors for depression differ between Caucasian and East Asian populations. But, nonetheless, as the vast majority of twin studies of depression symptoms have been carried out using Caucasians, genetic and environmental influences on depression symptoms in East Asians remain poorly understood. In the present study, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D) was administered to 490 pairs of South Korean adolescent and young adult twins (ages: 13-23 years) by telephone interview. In males, monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin correlations were similar (.44 vs. .41), suggesting the importance of shared environmental factors in depression symptoms. In females, however, MZ twin correlation was much greater than DZ twin correlation (.40 vs. .23), indicating the importance of genetic influences. The total phenotypic variance for the CES-D was greater in females than in males. Variance components model confirmed sex differences in the magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on depression symptoms: Additive genetic, shared environmental, and individual specific environmental effects in the full model were, res pectively, 12% (95% CI: 0-54%), 32% (95% CI: 0-53%), and 56% (95% CI: 44-70%) in males, and 41% (95% CI: 0-52%), 0% (95% CI: 0-36%), and 59% (95% CI: 48-72%) in females. Similar results were observed when 'culturally biased' items of the CES-D were separately analyzed. These variance components estimates for depression symptoms in East Asians overlap those observed in Caucasians.",

    "abstract": "Recently, in anticipation of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V, much consideration has been given to the diagnostic criteria for premature ejaculation (PE). The scientific community is yet to agree not only on the etiology of PE, but also on the most suitable diagnosis and forms of treatment. It has been suggested that the diagnostic criteria of PE should be strictly empirical and rely on intravaginal latency time alone, whereas others stress the need to also include psychological and personal factors.\nTo examine different indicators of PE and their relationship with and ability to predict sexual distress.\nStatistical analyses of data on sexual distress and different measures of ejaculatory function on a population-based sample of 3,332 Finnish men.\nThe present study involved a population-based sample of 3,332 males, of which 2,328 were twins aged 18-33, and 1,004 were over 18-year-old siblings to the aforementioned (M = 26.17 years of age). The individual contributions of different PE-indicator variables to experienced sexual distress were investigated by calculating correlations and performing a regression analysis.\nAll included indicators of PE were significantly associated with sexual distress, and significant and logical differences in sexual distress were found between intravariable levels for several of the indicator variables. Only variables relating to subjective experience (e.g., worrying about PE) were uniquely related to sexual distress when other indicators were controlled for.\nThe results suggest that variables measuring subjective experience may be useful when considering diagnostic criteria if indicators that are related to sexual distress are considered useful. However, overall, the association between PE and sexual distress is not especially strong, emphasizing the fact that more objective indicators of PE may not necessarily be associated with significant distress.",

    "abstract": "Menarche is a significant developmental event in the lives of young females. Genetic and family environmental influences on the timing of its occurrence are explored in the first formal analysis using reared-apart and reared-together monozygotic (MZA, MZT) and dizygotic (DZA, DZT) twin pairs. Mean age at menarche was 12.50 years (SD = 1.67) for the reared-apart pairs and 12.86 years (SD = 1.49) for the reared-together pairs. Intraclass correlations for age at menarche were 0.56 for MZA twins, 0.16 for DZA twins, 0.70 for MZT twins, and 0.41 for DZT twins. The mean within-pair difference was 1.07 years (SD = 1.04) for MZA twins, 1.67 years (SD = 1.59) for DZA twins, 0.64 year (SD = 0.86) for MZT twins, and 1.43 years (SD = 1.34) for DZT twins. These results are consistent with genetic influence, although the lower correlations for reared-apart twins and their larger within-pair differences suggest that age at menarche is partly affected by common rearing environments. Feeling understood by one's father during the growing-up years was significantly associated with earlier age at menarche, and a comparable trend was found for feeling understood by one's mother. These findings are considered with reference to current theories of pubertal timing.",

    "abstract": "One hundred percent of the cases of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) will develop carcinoma; therefore, the necessity of diagnosis at an early age with immediate therapy is essential. In the presence of identical twins, it is mandatory for both to undergo comprehensive colonic examination as early as possible. The study took place at a third-level general hospital with the objective of explaining in detail the importance of early diagnosis of FAP.\nWe report on FAP in identical male twins who were operated on at different times with different outcomes and prognosis. The first twin was treated 20 years previously at an early age and underwent subtotal colectomy with ileoproctostomy. This patient is currently asymptomatic with no evidence of malignancy. The second twin was operated on at the age of 33 years and was already a carrier of a well differentiated rectal adenocarcinoma.\nOpportune therapy carried out on the first twin has resulted in a disease-free status, in contrast with the delay in treatment of the second twin who developed carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Children born small for gestational age are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adulthood. The satiety signal leptin that regulates food intake and energy expenditure might be a possible molecular link, as umbilical cord leptin levels are positively correlated with birth weight. In the present study, we examined whether common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the leptin (LEP; 19G>A) gene and its receptor (LEPR; Q223R and K109R) are associated with birth weight and adult metabolic risk factors for type 2 diabetes in twins.\nSNPs were genotyped in 396 monozygotic and 232 dizygotic twins (286 men and 342 women, mean age 25 years) recruited from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. Data were analysed using linear mixed models.\nThe LEPR K109R SNP was associated with birth weight (KK, KR and RR (95% confidence interval, CI): 2511 (2465-2557), 2575 (2516-2635) and 2726 (2606-2845) gram; P(additive)=0.001). Also the LEPR Q223R SNP showed a significant association with weight at birth (QQ, QR and RR (95% CI): 2492 (2431-2554), 2545 (2495-2595) and 2655 (2571-2740) gram; P(additive)=0.003). Furthermore, an interaction between the LEPR K109R and the Q223R SNP on birth weight was observed (P=0.014). G allele carriers of the LEP 19G>A SNP had higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels compared to 19A homozygotes (GX vs AA (95% CI): 1.62 (1.58-1.66) vs 1.49 (1.40-1.58) mmol l(-1); P(recessive)=0.013).\nThis study indicates that leptin may act as a growth-promoting signal during fetal development, and suggests a possible role for the LEPR in explaining the inverse relationship between birth weight and the development of metabolic diseases in adulthood. Additionally, these results suggest that the LEP 19G>A SNP affect HDL cholesterol levels.",

    "abstract": "To disentangle the influences on health of selection processes related to genetic and rearing environmental factors from factors related to marriage benefits. We compared health status among same-sex male and female twin pairs who lived together during childhood and were discordant or concordant on adult marital status.\nA cross-sectional survey of a random sample of middle-aged Danish twins was conducted in 1998 to 1999. This study included 1175 same-sex twin pairs (52.5% monozygotic (MZ) and 47.5% dizygotic (DZ)). Data were obtained on adult marital status and on height, body mass index (BMI), depression symptoms, self-rated health, cognitive function, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake.\nAmong all 2350 individual twins, men who were divorced/widowed or never married had higher depression scores, lower cognitive test scores, lower physical activity scores, and were also less often moderate drinkers and nonsmokers compared with married men. Divorced/widowed women had higher depression scores and those divorced/widowed or never married were more often smokers than married women. Within twin pairs discordant on marital status, the divorced/widowed twin had higher average depression scores and was more likely to be a smoker. Never married twins had lower physical activity scores and never married male twins had higher BMI and higher depression scores than their married co-twin.\nThis study suggests that the relationships of adult divorce with depression and smoking in Danish twins are due to the stressful effects of marital dissolution, but that marital differences in other health and behavioral outcomes are most consistent with selection effects related to genetic or rearing environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "A longitudinal study.\nOur goal was to explore the role of digital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, by extending our earlier 5-year follow-up study of progression of lumbar spine degeneration with quantitative measures of disc degeneration.\nA longitudinal study is optimal for investigating disc degeneration but only a few studies (with small sample sizes) or short follow-up studies include repeated MRI data.\nSubjects consisted of 134 male monozygotic twins (age 35-69 years). Quantitative MRI measures included changes in disc bulging and height. Inter-rater reliability coefficients were between 0.77 and 0.96. At baseline and follow-up, an extensive interview about exposures to suspected determinants was conducted.\nReduction in disc height and increases in bulges (worsening) were seen in 2/3 of subjects. The mean reduction in disc height was 2.2% to 3.6%. A mean increase in bulging of 7% to 10% was found in the L1-L4 discs and 4% in L4-S1 discs. Although the mean changes were small, few reverse changes were observed. Familial aggregation, a proxy for genetic influences, explained 17% of changes in disc height, and 11% and 0% of changes in the sizes of anterior and posterior bulges in the regression models. Higher maximal occupational lifting (AR2 = 4.9%) and smoking (AR2 = 3.5%) during follow-up predicted more disc height reduction. Greater increases in bulging (AR2 = 7.4%-10.2%) were predicted by smaller bulges at baseline.\nThe mean annual changes in disc heights (<1%) and bulges (<2%) were small, and included both decreases and increases, with only a few subjects showing more major changes in either direction. The role of genetics was largest except in posterior bulges, but lifting and smoking were also associated with disc height reduction but none of the other studied risk factors were associated with anterior or posterior disc bulging. Different degenerative findings have different determinants of progression.",

    "abstract": "A United States consensus group on the live donor concluded that minors (<18 years) can ethically serve as live solid organ donors in exceptional circumstances. More recent international guidelines reject this position. Recent United Network of Organ Sharing data show that minors serve as living donors, albeit infrequently. We examined the attitudes of US physicians toward minors as living donors.\nFour hundred members of the American Society of Transplantation and 160 physicians from the American Academy of Pediatrics Section of Nephrology or Bioethics were surveyed. The physicians were asked whether minors should be permitted to serve as living donors and how their opinion would change depending on the twins' zygosity, age, and increased waitlist time.\nOne hundred seventy of 436 eligible participants (39%) returned surveys. Thirty-two and 39% of respondents would permit a kidney donation between 15-year-old fraternal and identical twins, respectively (P=NS). If the wait time increased from 1 to 6 years, willingness increased to 39% and 45%, respectively (P=NS). Pediatric bioethicists were the most reluctant to prohibit minors as living donors.\nApproximately one-third of US physicians would permit children to serve as donors. Lengthening the wait time is associated with a trend toward greater willingness to permit minor donations. Current policies that give preferential status for a deceased donor organ to minors may help minimize donations by their minor siblings. Nontransplant physicians need education about donor risks to ensure that donations are in the best interest of pediatric donors and recipients.",

    "abstract": "Defects in expression of genes of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria have been suggested to be a key pathophysiological feature in familial insulin resistance. We examined whether such defects can arise from lifestyle-related factors alone. Fourteen obesity-discordant (BMI difference 5.2 +/- 1.8 kg/m(2)) and 10 concordant (1.0 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2)) monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs aged 24-27 yr were identified among 658 MZ pairs in the population-based FinnTwin16 study. Whole body insulin sensitivity was measured using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. Transcript profiles of mitochondrial genes were compared using microarray data of fat biopsies from discordant twins. Body composition of twins was determined using DEXA and maximal oxygen uptake (Vo(2max)) and working capacity (W(max)) using a bicycle ergometer exercise test with gas exchange analysis. The obese cotwins had lower insulin sensitivity than their nonobese counterparts (M value 6.1 +/- 2.0 vs. 9.2 +/- 3.2 mg x kg LBM(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.01). Transcript levels of genes involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (GO:0006119) in adipose tissue were lower (P < 0.05) in the obese compared with the nonobese cotwins. The obese cotwins were also less fit, as measured by Vo(2max) (50.6 +/- 6.5 vs. 54.2 +/- 6.4 ml x kg LBM(-1) x min(-1), for obese vs. nonobese, P < 0.05), W(max) (3.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.7 W/kg LBM, P < 0.01) and also less active, by the Baecke leisure time physical activity index (2.8 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.6, P < 0.01). This implies that acquired poor physical fitness is associated with defective expression of the oxidative pathway components in adipose tissue mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "To determine the size of the growth deficit in Dutch monozygotic and dizygotic twins aged 0-2.5 years as compared to singletons and to construct reference growth charts for twins.\nGrowth of twins was studied using longitudinal data on over 4000 twins aged 0-2.5 years of the Netherlands Twin Register. The LMS method was used to obtain growth references for length/height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) for twins.\nDuring the first 2.5 years of age, differences in length/height and weight between twins and singletons decrease but do not disappear. BMI of twins deviates less than that of singletons. Approximately half of the growth retardation from birth until 1.5 years of age was attributable to gestational age. Between 1.5 years and 2.5 years of age, this difference was reduced to one-third. Thus, a substantial part of the growth difference could not be explained by gestational age.\nDuring the first 2.5 years of life, there is a difference in growth between twins and singletons. Twins catch up in their body size, i.e. they grow faster after birth, but do not yet achieve the same height and weight till they reach 2.5 years of age. We recommend the use of the growth references for twins.",

BMI of twins deviates less than that of singletons. Approximately half of the growth retardation from birth until 1.5 years of age was attributable to gestational age. Between 1.5 years and 2.5 years of age, this difference was reduced to one-third. Thus, a substantial part of the growth difference could not be explained by gestational age.",

    "abstract": "Using data from the Missouri maternally linked files (1989-1997), the authors examined the association among maternal obesity, obesity subtypes, and spontaneous and medically indicated preterm (<37 weeks) and very preterm (<33 weeks) births in singletons and twins. Adjusted odds ratios were obtained with correction for intracluster correlation. The prevalence of obesity increased by 77% over the study period (p(trend) < 0.001). Obese mothers had a lower risk for spontaneous preterm birth, and this was more pronounced among twins (odds ratio = 0.68, 95% confidence interval: 0.62, 0.75) than singletons (odds ratio = 0.84, 95% confidence interval: 0.82, 0.87). However, this association was present only among obese women who gained less than 0.69 kg/week for singletons and between 0.23 and 0.69 kg/week for twins. By contrast, obese mothers with singleton gestation had about 50% greater odds of medically indicated preterm (odds ratio = 1.46, 95% confidence interval: 1.39, 1.54) and very preterm (odds ratio = 1.49, 95% confidence interval: 1.34, 1.65) births, and the risk increases with ascending severity of obesity (p(trend) < 0.01). For extreme obesity, the risk of medically indicated preterm and very preterm births was almost double that for nonobese women. Similar findings were observed in twins. These data suggest that obesity increases the risk for medically indicated but not spontaneous preterm birth in both singletons and twins.",

    "abstract": "Although use of illicit drugs shows varying degree of heritability, the influence of shared and unique environmental factors predominate among adolescents. We explored factors predicting use of cannabis and other illicit drugs among Finnish adolescent twins.\nWe used longitudinal data from the FinnTwin12-17 study with baseline at age 11-12 and follow-up at ages 14 and 17(1/2), including 4138 individuals. The outcome was self-reported ever use of cannabis or other illicit drugs at age 17(1/2). The potential predictors were measures reported by the twins, their parents or teachers. As individual factors we tested smoking, alcohol use, behavioral and emotional problems; as peer factors: number of smoking friends and acquaintances with drug experience; as family factors: parental substance use, socio-economic status and pre-natal exposure to nicotine. We used logistic regression models, controlling for twinship, age and sex, to compute odds ratios (OR) for each potential predictor. To adjust for within-family confounds, we conducted conditional logistic regressions among 246 twin pairs discordant for drug use.\n13.5% of subjects had initiated use of cannabis or other illicit drugs by age of 17(1/2). When adjusted for within-family confounds, smoking, drinking, and aggressiveness, as well as smoking and drug use among peers predicted use of illicit drugs. In the final regression model, the significant predictors were female sex, early smoking onset, drinking to intoxication, having smoking peers and acquaintances with drug experience, father's weekly drinking to intoxication, and aggressive behavior among boys. Smoking initiation by age of 12 was the most powerful predictor among individuals (OR=26, p<0.001) and within discordant pairs (OR=22, p<0.001).\nEarly onset smoking is a powerful predictor for subsequent use of illicit drugs among Finnish adolescents, but the causal nature of this relationship needs to be clarified.",

    "abstract": "The observation of mirror-image clefts in conjoined twins may suggest an influence from environmental factors (e.g., poor blood supply) on the appearance of clefts. The present paper reports on a pair of male thoracopagus twins born to a 20-year-old woman. The twins were stillborn. Both twins exhibited complete unilateral cleft lip and palate with mirror-image configuration, affecting the left side for twin A and the right side for twin B. The twins also shared some organs. The case is discussed with similar information in the literature, with reference to possible related etiologic factors. Reporting on such occurrences throughout the world is important to shed light on important aspects underlying the formation of clefts.",

    "abstract": "We used diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) to reveal the extent of genetic effects on brain fiber microstructure, based on tensor-derived measures, in 22 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins and 23 pairs of dizygotic (DZ) twins (90 scans). After Log-Euclidean denoising to remove rank-deficient tensors, DTI volumes were fluidly registered by high-dimensional mapping of co-registered MP-RAGE scans to a geometrically-centered mean neuroanatomical template. After tensor reorientation using the strain of the 3D fluid transformation, we computed two widely-used scalar measures of fiber integrity: the fractional anisotropy (FA), and geodesic anisotropy (GA), which measures the geodesic distance between tensors in the symmetric positive-definite tensor manifold. Spatial maps of intraclass correlations (r) between MZ and DZ twins were compared to compute maps of Falconer's heritability statistics, i.e. the proportion of population variance explainable by genetic differences among individuals. Cumulative distribution plots (CDF) of effect sizes showed that the manifold measure, GA, marginally outperformed the Euclidean measure, FA, in detecting genetic correlations. While maps were relatively noisy, the CDFs showed promise for detecting genetic influences on brain fiber integrity as the current sample expands.",

    "abstract": "The nature, neural underpinnings, and etiology of deficits in verbal declarative memory in patients with schizophrenia remain unclear. To examine the contributions of genes and environment to verbal recall and recognition performance in this disorder, the California Verbal Learning Test was administered to a large population-based Finnish twin sample, which included schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients, their non-ill monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) co-twins, and healthy control twins. Compared with controls, patients and their co-twins showed relatively greater performance deficits on free recall compared with recognition. Intra-pair differences between patients and their non-ill co-twins in hippocampal volume and memory performance were highly positively correlated. These findings are consistent with the view that genetic influences are associated with reduced verbal recall in schizophrenia, but that non-genetic influences further compromise these abnormalities in patients who manifest the full-blown schizophrenia phenotype, with this additional degree of disease-related declarative memory deficit mediated in part by hippocampal pathology.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies with 1 healthy fetus and 1 hydatidiform mole are extremely rare events, occurring in 1:20,000-100,000 twin pregnancies.\nA 32-year-old, nulliparous woman underwent assisted reproduction due to male factor infertility. At 15 weeks' gestation a complete hydatidiform mole coexisting with a viable pregnancy was diagnosed. The couple decided to maintain the pregnancy following detailed counseling regarding the risks and benefits. At 26 weeks' gestation the patient prematurely delivered a 720-g fetus who did not survive due to extreme prematurity. The patient also delivered the products of the molar pregnancy.\nIn the event ofa twin pregnancy with 1 viable fetus and 1 molar, continuing the pregnancy may be considered as far as the mother is fully informed, not only regarding the complications that may arise but also regarding the chances of delivering a healthy infant.",

    "abstract": "We attempted to identify the association of multifocal hemangiomas, specifically hepatic hemangiomatosis, in twins. We retrospectively reviewed our database of infants with hemangiomas, identifying those twins who both had hemangiomas, and we report two cases of twins with hemangiomatosis, including hepatic hemangiomas. Of 39 sets of twins in our Hemangioma Program, both twins had hemangiomas in seven twin sets. Of these seven sets, only the two reported in this article had hemangiomatosis. There were also five sets of triplets, with one set having two siblings affected by hemangiomas. We concluded that although hemangiomas in multiple gestation infants is well known, hemangiomatosis including hepatic hemangiomatosis is unusual.",

    "abstract": "To estimate the influence of genetic effects in the aetiology and pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS).\nThe study comprised one Norwegian and two Danish nationwide twin surveys. In 1994 and 2002, respectively, 37,388 and 46,331 Danish twin individuals were asked by questionnaire if they had AS. Similarly, in 1998, 12,718 Norwegian twins were asked if they had AS using a questionnaire phrased according to the Danish survey. Twins reporting AS were categorized according to the modified New York criteria.\nA total of 113 twin individuals reported AS, of whom 81 (72.3%) participated in validation of the diagnosis. After validation, 39 probands were diagnosed with AS. Subsequent invitation of co-twins resulted in 27 complete pairs. The point prevalence and the annual incidence of AS was 0.1% and 3/100,000 person-years (pyr) among the Danish twins. The positive predictive value of self-reported AS was 49.3%. Probandwise concordance rates on AS were (2/5) 40% in monozygotic (MZ) and (1/23) 4% in dizygotic (DZ) twins [difference 35% (95% CI 2.9-72.8), p = 0.26]. Heredity analysis including previously published and the present HLA-B27-positive twin pairs indicated that additive genetic effects account for 94% (95% CI 0.56-0.99) of the variance in the causation of AS.\nSelf-reported AS needs careful validation. The occurrence of AS in a Danish twin population was 0.1% and accords well with previous studies on singletons in hospital settings. The present study adds to previous evidence of a major genetic effect in the pathogenesis of AS.",

An amniocentesis, performed at 15-weeks' gestation, confirmed that the singleton and one monozygotic twin were normal but the other monozygotic twin was trisomy 13.\nAfter diagnosis and counseling, selective termination of the trisomy 13 monozygotic twin was performed at 16 weeks and 4 days. At 18 weeks and 4 days the co-twin died. A healthy boy was delivered by elective caesarean section at 36-weeks' gestation.\nAssisted reproductive techniques that breach the embryo's zona pellucida such as assisted hatching and PGS embryo biopsy increase the incidence of monozygotic twins. Due to high levels of mosaicism in human preimplantation embryos, PGS cannot ensure that embryos diagnosed as normal and selected for transfer do not contain abnormal cells. Hence, further reports of discordant monozygotic twins following PGS are expected, emphasizing the need for appropriate counseling of patients wishing to embark on an IVF/PGS treatment cycle.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that a combination of host genetics and the composition of the gut microbiota are important for development of Crohn's disease (CD). Our aim was to study identical twins with CD to determine microbial factors independent of host genetics. Fecal samples were studied from 10 monozygotic twin pairs with CD (discordant n=6 and concordant n=4) and 8 healthy twin pairs. DNA was extracted, 16S rRNA genes were PCR amplified and T-RFLP fingerprints generated using general bacterial and Bacteroides group-specific primers. The microbial communities were also profiled based on their percentage G+C contents. Bacteroides 16S rRNA genes were cloned and sequenced from a subset of the samples. The bacterial diversity in each sample and similarity indices between samples were estimated based on the T-RFLP data using a combination of statistical approaches. Healthy individuals had a significantly higher bacterial diversity compared to individuals with CD. The fecal microbial communities were more similar between healthy twins than between twins with CD, especially when these were discordant for the disease. The microbial community profiles of individuals with ileal CD were significantly different from healthy individuals and those with colonic CD. Also, CD individuals had a lower relative abundance of B. uniformis and higher relative abundances of B. ovatus and B. vulgatus. Our results suggest that genetics and/or environmental exposure during childhood, in part, determine the gut microbial composition. However, CD is associated with dramatic changes in the gut microbiota and this was particularly evident for individuals with ileal CD.",

    "abstract": "Functional brain imaging studies have shown deviant amygdala responses to emotional stimuli in subjects suffering from anxiety and depressive disorder, but both hyperactivity and hypoactivity compared to healthy controls have been reported. To account for these discrepant findings, we hypothesize that genetic and environmental risk factors differently impact on amygdala functioning.\nTo test this hypothesis, we assessed amygdala responses to an emotional faces paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for the risk of anxiety and depression (n=10 pairs) and in monozygotic twin pairs concordant for high (n=7 pairs) or low (n=15 pairs) risk for anxiety and depression.\nMain effects (all faces vs. baseline) revealed robust bilateral amygdala activity across groups. In discordant twins, increased amygdala responses were found for negatively valenced stimuli (angry/anxious faces) in high-risk twins compared to their low-risk co-twins. In contrast, concordant high-risk pairs revealed blunted amygdala reactivity to both positive and negative faces compared with concordant low-risk pairs. Post-hoc analyses showed that these findings were independent of 5-HTTLPR genotype.\nOur findings indicate amygdala hyperactivity in subjects who are at high risk for anxiety and depression through environmental factors and amygdala hypoactivity in those at risk mainly through genetic factors. We suggest that this result reflects a difference in baseline amygdala activation in these groups. Future imaging studies on anxiety and depression should aim to avoid admixture of subjects who are at genetic risk with those at risk due to environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Combat exposure is associated with increased risk of psychiatric and substance use disorders in veterans. However, it is not known whether combat exposure independently increases risk for these disorders or whether this association is accounted for by genetic vulnerability common to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This article tests competing explanations for the association of combat exposure and PTSD with nicotine dependence (ND), alcohol dependence (AD), and major depression (MD). Data were obtained from 6099 members of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, a national registry of male-male twin pairs who served in the military during the Vietnam era. Twin models were fit to estimate the genetic and environmental variance common and specific to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition, lifetime diagnoses of PTSD, combat trauma, and 3 comorbid conditions: ND, AD, and MD. Variance specific to ND, AD, and MD was due to genetic factors (48%, 36%, and 12%, respectively) and unique environmental factors (36%, 42%, and 58%, respectively). After accounting for variance common to PTSD, no residual genetic and environmental variance overlapped between combat and ND, combat and AD, and combat and MD. Combat exposure is not independently associated with lifetime ND, AD, and MD. The association of combat exposure with these 3 disorders is due to genetic and unique environmental contributions in common with PTSD. These findings suggest comorbid PTSD may represent a genetically mediated vulnerability to psychopathology after trauma.",

    "abstract": "Platelet-type von Willebrand disease (PT-VWD) and type 2B von Willebrand disease (2B-VWD) have different etiologies although both present with a similar clinical bleeding and basic laboratory phenotype. Both PT-VWD and 2B-VWD represent gain-of-function mutations that lead to enhanced binding between plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) and its platelet ligand, glycoprotein Ib alpha (GP1BA). However, 2B-VWD results from a functionally abnormal VWF molecule arising from mutations in the VWF gene, whereas PT-VWD is caused by hyperresponsive platelets resulting from mutations in the platelet GP1BA gene. A definitive diagnosis of PT-VWD versus 2B-VWD is critical for treatment decisions (as differential therapies might be respectively required) and also for family counseling. However, laboratory discrimination of PT-VWD versus 2B-VWD is problematic because simple phenotypic testing will not permit their differentiation, and the more complex testing approaches that might permit their differentiation are rarely applied, or are perhaps poorly applied. Although differential identification of PT-VWD versus 2B-VWD can most definitively be achieved by identifying the gene defect at either the VWF or GP1BA loci, such tests are not commonly available, not always successful, and even if available and successful might not be readily available to serve time-critical treatment decisions. Accordingly, simple laboratory tools to enable discrimination of the two disorders would be a valuable addition to the test repertoire of the hemostasis laboratory. This article provides a review of PT-VWD-related literature and an overview of a phenotypic laboratory test process that should enable the effective identification of PT-VWD and its discrimination from 2B-VWD.",

    "abstract": "Testing the trade-off between child quantity and quality within a family is complicated by the endogeneity of family size. Using data from the Chinese Population Census, we examine the effect of family size on child educational attainment in China. We find a negative correlation between family size and child outcome, even after we control for the birth order effect. We then instrument family size by the exogenous variation that is induced by a twin birth and find a negative effect offamily size on children's education. We also find that the effect of family size is more evident in rural China, where the public education system is poor. Given that our estimates of the effect of having twins on nontwins at least provide the lower bound of the true effect of family size, these findings suggest a quantity-quality trade-off for children in developing countries.",

    "abstract": "Depression is typically considered relative to individuals and thought to originate from both biological and environmental factors. However, the environmental constraints and insults that African Americans experience likely influence the concordance by age and gender for depression scores among adult African American twins. Monozygotic (MZ) (n = 102) and Dizygotic (DZ) (n = 110) twins, age 25-88 years in the Carolina African American Twin Study of Aging were examined using an 11-item version of the CES-D measure of depressive symptomatology. Those participants with scores above nine were considered depressed. Overall, the MZ pairs had a higher concordance than the DZ pairs implying genetic influence. Both MZ and DZ males had higher concordances than either female zygosity groups. The difference between the concordance rates for MZ and DZ twin pairs was greater in males than females. By age group, the difference between the concordance rates for younger MZ and DZ twin pairs was much larger than for older pairs. The results suggest that, even though African Americans may be at risk for depression due to contextual/environmental factors, genetic influences remain important.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this article is to review the prenatal diagnosis and treatment of complicated monochorionic twins, with emphasis on surgical management via operative fetoscopy.\nUltrasound is effective in the diagnosis and surveillance of several conditions that complicate monochorionic twins, such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome, twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence, selective intrauterine growth restriction, and discordant anomalous twins. Ultrasound is also useful in identifying risk factors for poor perinatal outcomes and identifying those pregnancies that may benefit from fetal intervention. Operative fetoscopy has emerged as a useful tool in the surgical management of complicated monochorionic twins. Recent findings support the use of laser therapy for the treatment of mid-trimester twin-twin transfusion syndrome at experienced centers. The reduction in hemodynamic stress associated with definitive treatment of twin-twin transfusion syndrome by laser surgery translates to improved short and long-term perinatal outcomes. Pregnancies complicated by twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence that meet surgical criteria benefit from umbilical cord occlusion. A prospective randomized trial regarding the role of laser therapy for selective intrauterine growth restriction is ongoing.\nOperative fetoscopy has an important role in the management of complicated monochorionic twins.",

    "abstract": "The risk of congenital anomalies in twins is higher than in singletons, but it is less well reported in relation to chorionicity. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of congenital anomalies in twin pregnancies by chorionicity and by major subtype and compare the rates with those in singletons.\nThe study population included 2329 twin pregnancies (4658 twins) and 147,655 singletons delivered in the Northeast of England during 1998-2002. Data were obtained from the population-based Northern Multiple Pregnancy Register and Northern Congenital Abnormality Survey.\nThe rate of congenital anomalies in twins was 405.8 per 10,000 twins versus 238.2 per 10,000 singletons [rate ratios (RR) = 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-2.0]. In twins with known chorionicity (84.8% of all twins), the prevalence of congenital anomalies in monochorionic (MC) twins (633.6 per 10,000) was nearly twice that in dichorionic (343.7 per 10,000; RR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.5). There was an increased rate of congenital anomalies in twin compared with singleton pregnancies for all major types of anomalies, except chromosomal abnormalities.\nThis study using high quality, population-based data on multiple pregnancies and congenital anomalies found that twins, particularly MC twins, have a higher risk of congenital anomalies than singletons.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that the timing of puberty is associated with BMI in childhood and adult stature. Because the genetic background of these associations is not thoroughly investigated, we aimed to analyze it in a longitudinal twin cohort.\nWe studied a Swedish cohort of 99 monozygotic and 76 dizygotic twin pairs born between 1973 and 1979 with weight and length or height measured annually from birth to age 18 years. Age at onset of pubertal growth spurt, age at peak height velocity, and final height were estimated by a parametric JPA2 growth model. The genetic architecture and mutual associations of these traits and childhood BMI were analyzed by linear structural equation modeling.\nThe heritability estimate was 0.91 for age at onset of pubertal growth spurt, 0.93 for age at peak height velocity, and 0.97 for adult height. Age at onset of pubertal growth spurt was negatively associated with BMI from 1 to 10 years of age and stature in early adulthood. For age at peak height velocity, we found similar associations with childhood BMI and stature in early adulthood. These associations were explained by common genetic factors.\nGrowth during puberty is strictly genetically regulated. These genetic factors also explain why boys who matured early had higher BMI through childhood and taller stature in early adulthood.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the crown-rump length (CRL) and the fetal head and trunk (HT) volume between singletons and twins conceived after in vitro fertilization. Thirty pregnant patients submitted to embryo transfer were enrolled in this research. Ten conceived twins (20 dichorionic fetuses) while other 20 conceived singletons. The gestational age was calculated by adding 14 d to the number of days between the oocyte retrieval and the scheduled ultrasound. Three-dimensional ultrasound scans were performed weekly from 73 d (10 wk and 3 d) to 101 d (14 wk and 3 d) of gestational age. HT volume was assessed by VOCAL using 15 degrees step rotation on the manual mode. The measurement of CRL was performed by using the longitudinal plane of the fetus in the multiplanar view. The CRL and HT volume weekly relative increase were evaluated to compare the growth between singletons and twins. No significant difference was identified, in any analyzed week, when comparing the mean of CRL and HT volume between singletons and twins. Additionally, no significant difference between singletons and twins was noticed when comparing the weekly relative increase, both for CRL and HT volume. However, the weekly relative increase was significantly higher for HT volume than for CRL in every week studied for both singletons and twins. The total relative increase observed between 73 and 101 d was much higher for HT volume than for CRL: 679 +/- 39% versus 138 +/- 18% in singletons and 689 +/- 58% versus 139 +/- 21% in twins (HT volume and CRL, respectively), suggesting that HT volume could more accurately determine the gestational age.",

    "abstract": "Clarifying the sources of variation among autism symptom domains is important to the identification of homogenous subgroups for molecular genetic studies. This study explored the genetic and environmental bases of nonverbal communication and social interaction, two symptom domains that have also been related to treatment response, in 1294 child and adolescent twins and siblings with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange under the age of 18. Twin/sibling resemblance was assessed through correlations and behavior genetic modeling of Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI) nonverbal communication and social scores. Variation in these phenotypes was explained by additive genetic, dominant genetic, and unique environmental factors with no evidence for shared environmental factors. Broad heritability estimates were higher for nonverbal communication (45%) than social interaction (28%). Nonverbal communication and social scores were partially accounted for by the same underlying genetic and environmental factors. Gender differences were not supported. These results add to information on familial resemblance of these symptom domains based on correlational methods, and this study is one of the first to apply behavioral genetic modeling to a PDD population. The results have implications for molecular genetics as well as treatment.",

    "abstract": "Primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is the most common inherited structural urinary tract disorder, conforming closely to autosomal dominant transmission. A pair of monozygotic siblings is described exhibiting a remarkably parallel clinical course. VUR grade II was diagnosed in girl A during urinary tract infection at the age of 2 yr; screening of her asymptomatic sister (girl B) revealed the same. Renal cortical scintigraphy unveiled unilateral hypo-dysplasia in both the twins. Despite trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis, infection recurred in girl A after 7 months, while girl B had a first episode 2 months later that prompted regimen switch to nitrofurantoin. Follow-up at the age of 4 depicted bilateral reflux deterioration; an urodynamics study that followed revealed functional bladder instability in both girls and the oral antispasmodic oxybutynin was initiated with good results. Evaluation for reflux should be prompt in infants with urinary infection. Patient siblings display a higher relative reflux risk, being highest in identical twins. Heredity issues, the impact of age and dysfunctional voiding in the clinical course, and the contribution of nuclear medicine in VUR management are discussed.",

    "abstract": "As handwriting is influenced by physiology, training, and other behavioral factors, a study of the handwriting of twins can shed light on the individuality of handwriting. This paper describes the methodology and results of such a study where handwriting samples of twins were compared by an automatic handwriting verification system. The results complement that of a previous study where a diverse population was used. The present study involves samples of 206 pairs of twins, where each sample consisted of a page of handwriting. The verification task was to determine whether two half-page documents (where the original samples were divided into upper and lower halves) were written by the same individual. For twins there were 1236 verification cases -- including 824 tests where the textual content of writing was different, and 412 tests where it was the same. An additional set of 1648 test cases were obtained from handwriting samples of nontwins (general population). To make the handwriting comparison, the system computed macro features (overall pictorial attributes), micro features (characteristics of individual letters), and style features (characteristics of whole-word shapes and letter pairs). Four testing scenarios were evaluated: twins and nontwins writing the same text and writing different texts. Results of the verification tests show that the handwriting of twins is less discriminable than that of nontwins: an overall error rate of 12.91% for twins and 3.7% for nontwins. Error rates with identical twins were higher than with fraternal twins. Error rates in all cases can be arbitrarily reduced by rejecting (not making a decision on) borderline cases. A level of confidence in the results obtained is given by the fact that system error rates are comparable to that of humans (lower than that of lay persons and higher than that of questioned document examiners [QDEs]).",

The intrapair coefficient for twin resemblance (r=0.75, p=0.001) strongly suggests that baseline serum adiponectin concentration is a familial trait.\nThese data provide evidence that adiponectin concentration is a familial trait in normal-weight individuals, that it decreases when challenged by positive energy balance, and that its overfeeding-induced variations are correlated with glucose and insulin levels.",

    "abstract": "We used a prospective cohort to analyze the effect of change in BMI rather than change in weight, in mothers carrying dichorionic twins from a population that did not receive any dietary intervention. A total of 269 mothers (150 nulliparas and 119 multiparas) were evaluated. The average change (%) from the pre-gravid BMI was 7.2+/-6.1, 17.4+/-8.2, and 28.7+/-10.8, at 12-14, 22-25, and 30-34 weeks, respectively, without difference between nulliparas and multiparas. The comparison between maternities below or above the average change from the pregravid BMI failed to demonstrate an advantage (in terms of total twin birthweight and gestational age) of an above average change from the pregravid BMI, even when the lower versus upper quartiles were compared. Our observations reached different conclusions regarding the recommended universal dietary intervention in twin gestations. A cautious approach is advocated towards seemingly harmless excess weight gain, as normal weight women may turn overweight, or even obese, by the end of pregnancy, and be exposed to the untoward effects of obesity on future health and body image.",

    "abstract": "In national birth registers of Caucasians, the secondary sex ratio, that is, the number of boys per 100 girls at birth, is almost constant at 106. Variations other than random variation have been noted, and attention is being paid to identifying presumptive influential factors. Studies of the influence of different factors have, however, yielded meagre results. An effective means of identifying discrepancies is to investigate birth data compiled into sibships of different sizes. Assuming no inter- or intra-maternal variations, the distributions of the sex composition are binomial. Varying parental tendencies for a specific sex result in discrepancies from the binomial distribution. Over a century ago, the German scientists Geissler and Lommatzsch analyzed the vital statistics of Saxony, including twin maternities, for the last quarter of the 19th century. They considered sibships ending with twin sets. Their hypothesis was that in sibships ending with male-male twin pairs, the sex ratio among previous births is higher than normal, while in sibships with female-female twin pairs, the sex ratio is lower than normal. If the sibship ended with a male-female pair, then the sex ratio is almost normal. Consequently, a same-sex twin set indicated, in general, deviations in the sex ratio among the sibs within the sibship. Our analyzes of their data yielded statistically significant results that support their statements.",

Sex differences in prevalence and incidence of irritable bowel syndrome have been demonstrated however less is known about sex differences in heritability. The objective was to investigate whether there were sex differences in heritability of irritable bowel syndrome while accounting for different prevalences among women and men in different age groups. A sample of 45,750 Swedish twins, whereof 16,961 were complete twin pairs, participated in a telephone interview. The sample was divided into three age groups (40-54, 55-64 and 65 years and older) and the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome was operationally defined with a number of disorder specific symptoms. Standard biometrical model fitting analyses were conducted using raw ordinal data from same-sex and opposite-sex twins. The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome was greater among women than men and more prevalent at younger ages (e.g., women 10.3%, men 6.3% at ages 40-54 years vs. women 6.1%, men 4% at ages over 65 years). The heritability of the disorder was approximately 25% in all age groups. We found no evidence for sex differences in heritability in any of the age groups, however, models allowing prevalences of irritable bowel syndrome to differ between sexes and age groups fitted best.",

    "abstract": "Several studies report caesarean section (CS) to be a risk factor for childhood asthma. We used data from a large cohort of 5-year-old twins to examine the relationship between mode of birth delivery and asthma. The extent to which an infant is exposed to maternal vaginal flora may protect against the risk of developing asthma. Therefore, we expect a lower rate of asthma in twins born by vaginal delivery (VD) than those born by CS, and a lower rate of asthma in first-born twins compared to second-born twins by VD. Information on mode of delivery was obtained at the time of birth in a survey completed by the mother shortly after delivery. Information on history of asthma diagnosis by a physician was obtained by parental report when the twins were 5 years old. Complete data were available for 6330 first-born and 5438 second-born twins from birth cohorts 1991-2000. Full term first-born twins born by CS had a significantly higher risk of asthma compared to those born by VD, odds ratio=1.59 (95% CI=1.23-2.06). No significant differences were observed between CS and VD first-born twins when gestational age was less than 37 weeks, and no significant differences were observed between CS and VD second-born twins at any gestational age. No differences in asthma prevalence were found between first- and second-born twins both born by VD. CS may increase the risk of asthma to full term infants, however, the underlying mechanism is unclear.",

    "abstract": "A consistent finding from twin studies is that the environment shared by family members does not contribute to the variation in susceptibility to asthma. At the same time, it is known that environmental risk factors that are shared by family members are associated with the liability for asthma. We hypothesize that the absence of a main effect of shared environmental factors in twin studies can be explained by gene-environment interaction, that is, that the effect of an environmental factor shared by family members depends on the genotype of the individual. We explore this hypothesis by modeling the resemblance in asthma liability in twin pairs as a function of various environmental risk factors and test for gene-environment interaction. Asthma data were obtained by parental report for nearly 12,000 5-year-old twin pairs. A series of environmental risk factors was examined: birth cohort, gestational age, time spent in incubator, breastfeeding, maternal educational level, maternal smoking during pregnancy, current smoking of parents, having older siblings, and amount of child care outside home. Results revealed that being a boy, born in the 1990s, premature birth, longer incubator time, and child care outside home increased the risk for asthma. With the exception of premature birth, however, none of these factors modified the genetic effects on asthma. In very premature children shared environmental influences were important. In children born after a gestation of 32 weeks or more only genetic factors were important to explain familial resemblance for asthma.",

    "abstract": "The present study assessed the prevalence of asthma and allergy, and estimated the importance of genetic and environmental influences on asthma and allergy liability and their association. Longitudinal data on self-reported, doctor-diagnosed asthma and allergy were collected in over 14,000 individuals registered with the Netherlands Twin Register. Structural equation modeling was used for univariate and bivariate genetic analyses on data from twins, their siblings, and parents. Results showed no sex, age, and minimal birth cohort effects for asthma prevalence (11.8%). For allergy, prevalence was higher in women (19.8%) than in men (13.9%). Allergy prevalence at ages 22, 23, and 24 years increased from the 1970 to the 1980 birth cohort. The prevalence of allergy, but not of asthma, was higher in nontwin siblings than in twins. No assortative mating was observed. High (broad-sense) heritabilities were found for asthma (75%) and allergy (66%), with evidence for nonadditive genetic effects in asthma. The association between asthma and allergy (correlation=.65) was largely due to common genes (70%). No sex differences in genetic architecture were found. In conclusion, the prevalence of allergy but not of asthma increased in recent years. Individual differences in the liability to asthma, allergy and their co-occurrence are for a large part accounted for by differences in genetic background. Nonadditive gene action is important, which may have consequences for gene hunting strategies.",

    "abstract": "A number of studies have provided evidence of a significant familial aggregation for both asthma and hay fever, and have reported a substantial comorbidity between the two conditions. However, far fewer, especially in Italy, have aimed at clarifying the origins of such comorbidity. The main aims of the present study were (a) to estimate heritability of asthma and hay fever, (b) to measure the association between asthma and hay fever at the individual level, and (c) to assess the extent to which genetic and environmental factors, shared by the two conditions, mediate this association. The twin method was used. The study sample was derived from the Italian Twin Registry, and included 392 twin pairs aged 8 to 17 years. Data collection was performed through parent self-administered questionnaire. Bivariate structural equation twin modeling was applied to asthma and hay fever. Genetic factors accounted for 92% and 78% of the variance in liability to asthma and hay fever, respectively, with the remaining contributions due to unique environmental influences. The within-individual association between asthma and hay fever was substantial. The genetic correlation between the two conditions was .58, whereas no evidence of overlapping unique environmental effects was found. In conclusion, this study showed a high heritability of asthma and hay fever in the Italian child and adolescent population. It also indicated that asthma and hay fever share, to a large extent, a common genetic background, and environmental factors are not relevant to explain the comorbidity.",

    "abstract": "An investigation of genetic structures underlying autistic traits was performed with samples from twins for which at least one proband had been ascertained as having autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in our catchment area. In order to adjust for recent concepts of autism, we employed criteria for the broad spectrum of disease and the childhood autism rating scale (CARS) for quantitative assessment. The CARS test was performed on 45 twin pairs (19 monozygotic, 26 dizygotic) detected with a regional routine screening system. The obtained CARS scores were subjected to structural equation modeling (SEM), incorporating sex differences for each causal influence ascertainment correction, using the Mx software. A best fitting model of causal influences on autistic traits measured continuously, incorporating additive genetic (A) and non-shared environmental influences (E), was generated. With this AE model, the estimated heritability was 0.73 for males and 0.87 for females, based on the continuous CARS scores. There was no evidence for the existence of sex-specific genetic influences. Autistic traits were highly heritable in twins with even broad spectrum of autism, corresponding to the results of early studies based on classical autism. Additive genetic factors were more influential in females than males.",

Several forms of TTTS have been described, including chronic TTTS, acute perimortem TTTS, twin anaemia-polycythaemia sequence, acute perinatal TTTS and twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence. A significant evolution in prenatal care strategies and management options for patients with TTTS has occurred during the last decade. In chronic TTTS, endoscopic laser ablation of communicating placental vessels has led to an increase in survival rates. This review analyzes the possible pathophysiologic mechanisms involved, discusses the latest findings in diagnosis, therapy and prognosis, and focuses on fetal and neonatal haematologic complications associated with the various forms of TTTS.",

    "abstract": "Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a severe complication of monozygotic (identical) twin fetuses sharing one single (monochorionic) placenta. TTTS is caused by a net inter-twin transfusion of blood through placental anastomoses, from one twin (the donor) to the other (the recipient), which link the two feto-placental circulations. Currently, the only reliable method to measure the net inter-twin transfusion clinically is when incomplete laser therapy of TTTS occurs and one of the twins becomes anemic and requires an intra-uterine transfusion of adult red blood cells. Then, differences between adult hemoglobin concentrations measured during the transfusion and at birth relate not only to the net inter-twin transfusion but also to the finite lifetime of the adult red blood cells. We have analyzed this situation, derived the differential equations of adult hemoglobin in the donor and recipient twins, given the solutions and given expressions relating the net inter-twin flow with clinically measured parameters. We have included single and multiple intra-uterine transfusions. In conclusion, because incomplete laser therapy occurs frequently, and some cases require an intra-uterine transfusion, this method may allow collecting a wealth of net inter-twin flow data from clinicians involved in laser therapy of TTTS. To aid to the widespread use of this method, we have presented the equations as clearly as possible in tables for easy use by others.",

    "abstract": "Emotional processing and brain activation were examined during an encoding and recognition paradigm using emotionally salient words in a sample of monozygotic twin pairs at low or high risk for anxiety and depression. Discordant twin pairs were used to chart the effects of environmental risk factors and concordant twin pairs were used to chart the effects of genetic risk factors on performance and brain activation. Performance data did not support the existence of a negative response bias in subjects at high risk. At the neural level, however, increased left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) activation by negative words was found in high-risk subjects, most prominently during recognition. Increased LIFG activity was found in subjects at high risk through either genetic or environmental risk factors. These results suggest that fMRI activation of the LIFG in a verbal emotional memory task may be a useful vulnerability marker for anxiety and depression.",

    "abstract": "To examine neurobiological changes underlying obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) we examined intrapair differences in behavior and fMRI brain activation in monozygotic twins discordant for OCS, using a Tower of London planning paradigm. Despite only mild evidence for impairment at the behavioral level, twins with OCS showed significantly decreased brain activation during planning in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, thalamus pulvinar, and inferior parietal cortex. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of disturbed cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuitry underlying OCS. In contrast to previous studies in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) we did not find robust evidence for reduced responsiveness in striatal brain regions. Together, these findings suggest that neurobiological mechanisms underlying OCS of environmental origin partly overlap with neurobiological changes in patients with OCD, where the disorder is likely caused by a combination of genetic and environmental influences. A difference between genetical and environmental etiologies may relate to the amount of reduced striatal responsiveness.",

    "abstract": "The acquired component of complex traits is difficult to dissect in humans. Obesity represents such a trait, in which the metabolic and molecular consequences emerge from complex interactions of genes and environment. With the substantial morbidity associated with obesity, a deeper understanding of the concurrent metabolic changes is of considerable importance. The goal of this study was to investigate this important acquired component and expose obesity-induced changes in biological pathways in an identical genetic background.\nWe used a special study design of \"clonal controls,\" rare monozygotic twins discordant for obesity identified through a national registry of 2,453 young, healthy twin pairs. A total of 14 pairs were studied (eight male, six female; white), with a mean +/- standard deviation (SD) age 25.8 +/- 1.4 y and a body mass index (BMI) difference 5.2 +/- 1.8 kg/m(2). Sequence analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in subcutaneous fat and peripheral leukocytes revealed no aberrant heteroplasmy between the co-twins. However, mtDNA copy number was reduced by 47% in the obese co-twin's fat. In addition, novel pathway analyses of the adipose tissue transcription profiles exposed significant down-regulation of mitochondrial branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism (p < 0.0001). In line with this finding, serum levels of insulin secretion-enhancing BCAAs were increased in obese male co-twins (9% increase, p = 0.025). Lending clinical relevance to the findings, in both sexes the observed aberrations in mitochondrial amino acid metabolism pathways in fat correlated closely with liver fat accumulation, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia, early aberrations of acquired obesity in these healthy young adults.\nOur findings emphasize a substantial role of mitochondrial energy- and amino acid metabolism in obesity and development of insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "Human height is a highly heritable and complex trait but finding important genes has proven more difficult than expected. One reason might be the composite measure of height which may add heterogeneity and noise. The aim of this study was to conduct a genome-wide linkage scan to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for lengths of spine, femur, tibia, humerus and radius. These were investigated as alternative measures for height in a large, population-based twin sample with the potential to find genes underlying bone size and bone diseases. 3,782 normal Caucasian females, 18-80 years old, with whole body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images were used. A novel and reproducible method, linear pixel count (LPC) was used to measure skeletal sizes on DXA images. Intraclass correlations and heritability estimates were calculated for lengths of spine, femur, tibia, humerus and radius on monozygotic (MZ; n = 1,157) and dizygotic (DZ; n = 2,594) twins. A genome-wide linkage scan was performed on 2000 DZ twin subjects. All skeletal sites excluding spine were highly correlated. Intraclass correlations showed results for MZ twins to be significantly higher than DZ twins for all traits. Heritability results were as follows: spine, 66%; femur, 73%; tibia, 65%; humerus, 57%; radius, 68%. Results showed reliable evidence of highly suggestive linkage on chromosome 5 for spine (LOD score = 3.0) and suggestive linkage for femur (LOD score = 2.19) in the regions of 105cM and 155cM respectively. We have shown strong heritability of all skeletal sizes measured in this study and provide preliminary evidence that spine length is linked to the chromosomal region 5q15-5q23.1. Bone size phenotype appears to be more useful than traditional height measures to uncover novel genes. Replication and further fine mapping of this region is ongoing to determine potential genes influencing bone size and diseases affecting bone.",

    "abstract": "To report discordant phenotypes, resulting from the same mutation in exon ORF15 (GenBank AF286472) of the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator gene (RPGR) (GenBank U57629), in 2 presumed dizygotic twin brothers with X-linked retinal disease.\nThe 2 brothers underwent complete ophthalmic examination that included best-corrected visual acuity, slitlamp biomicroscopy, and detailed fundus examination. Visual field recording using Goldmann kinetic perimetry and a full-field electroretinogram were also obtained in both patients. Mutational screening was performed for RPGR because of an X-linked pattern of inheritance indicated by pedigree analysis.\nOne brother had a phenotypic expression of cone-rod dystrophy, while the other exhibited X-linked retinitis pigmentosa. A 1-nucleotide deletion was identified in the 3' region of exon ORF15 of RPGR (ORF15 + 1339delA).\nAn identical mutation in RPGR-ORF15 manifested distinct clinical phenotypes in individuals of the same family. Our data provide strong evidence in support of additional modifier genes that can produce diverse disease phenotypes in patients with RPGR mutations.\nThe clinical observation of different retinal phenotypes in a family with the same mutation in exon ORF15 of RPGR implicates the potential importance of modifier genes for the phenotypic expression of this form of X-linked retinal disease.",

    "abstract": "Growth modeling is a useful tool for studying change over time, and it is becoming increasingly popular with developmental researchers. There is a considerable methodological literature surrounding growth modeling for individuals; however, far less attention has been focused on growth models for pairs of related individuals (i.e., dyads). In this article, the authors consider dyadic growth models for those cases where there are no relevant variables that can empirically distinguish between dyad members (e.g., same-sex twins or best friends). The authors describe how researchers can estimate growth models for indistinguishable dyads using both multilevel modeling and structural equation modeling. Although both approaches can be used to estimate the same underlying models, the authors focus on practical similarities and differences between the two approaches. They illustrate modeling issues using an overtime study of adolescent twins' conflict with their mothers, a substantively important topic given the enduring interest in parent-child relationships during adolescence.",

    "abstract": "The effect of genetic variants underlying atherosclerosis is thought to be mediated through intermediate phenotypes such as serum cholesterol levels. Localization of quantitative trait loci influencing levels of serum lipids and (apo)lipoproteins may aid in the search for determinants of susceptibility to atherosclerotic diseases. Since apolipoprotein A-I is the primary protein constituent of high-density lipoprotein, it is considered to be critical for the antiatherogenic effect of high-density lipoproteins. We describe here an effort to map loci influencing apolipoprotein A-I levels. Measurements of apolipoprotein A-I levels and genome scans with more than 1000 microsatellite markers were successfully performed in both members of 501 pairs of fraternal twins from Sweden. Variance component linkage analysis was undertaken to map quantitative trait loci. In the total study sample, two loci showed comparable suggestive evidence of linkage, 6p21-12 (LOD=2.4) and 12q23 (LOD=2.4). Sex-limited analyses revealed significant female-specific linkage at marker D15S156 on 15q11-13 (LOD=4.1). The loci on 12q and 15q in the present study confirm previously reported loci for apolipoprotein A-I, while the peak on chromosome 6p lends further support to a locus influencing several phenotypes related to atherosclerosis. Intriguingly, the presence of genes belonging to the phospholipase A2 superfamily under three out of four observed linkage peaks would lend some support to the view that this group of genes might collectively represent candidates as apolipoprotein A-I level regulators.",

    "abstract": "Although the sex difference in eating disorder prevalence has typically been attributed to psychosocial factors, biological factors may also play a role. Prenatal testosterone exposure is a promising candidate, since it masculinizes behavior in animals and humans via its permanent effects on the central nervous system.\nTo examine whether in utero testosterone exposure has masculinizing effects on disordered eating (DE) by comparing opposite-sex (OS) and same-sex (SS) twins. Twin type (SS vs OS) is considered a proxy measure of prenatal hormone exposure, since females from OS pairs are exposed to more testosterone in utero than females from SS pairs. A linear trend in mean levels of DE was predicted based on expected prenatal testosterone exposure, with SS female twins exhibiting the highest levels of DE followed by OS female twins, OS male twins, and SS male twins.\nA twin study comparison of OS vs SS twins.\nMichigan State University Twin Registry.\nParticipants included 304 SS female twins, 59 OS female twins, 54 OS male twins, and 165 SS male twins.\nOverall levels of DE were assessed with the Minnesota Eating Behavior Survey.\nConfirming hypotheses, DE exhibited significant linear trends, with SS female twins exhibiting the highest levels of DE followed by OS female twins, OS male twins, and SS male twins. This linear trend could not be accounted for by levels of anxiety or socialization effects. Indeed, OS female twins exhibited lower levels of DE compared with an independent sample of undergraduate women (n = 69) who were raised with 1 or more brothers.\nThe masculinization of DE in OS female twins is unlikely to be due to socialization effects alone. Biological factors, such as the masculinization of the central nervous system by prenatal testosterone exposure, may also contribute to sex differences in DE prevalence.",

    "abstract": "The exploration of copy-number variation (CNV), notably of somatic cells, is an understudied aspect of genome biology. Any differences in the genetic makeup between twins derived from the same zygote represent an irrefutable example of somatic mosaicism. We studied 19 pairs of monozygotic twins with either concordant or discordant phenotype by using two platforms for genome-wide CNV analyses and showed that CNVs exist within pairs in both groups. These findings have an impact on our views of genotypic and phenotypic diversity in monozygotic twins and suggest that CNV analysis in phenotypically discordant monozygotic twins may provide a powerful tool for identifying disease-predisposition loci. Our results also imply that caution should be exercised when interpreting disease causality of de novo CNVs found in patients based on analysis of a single tissue in routine disease-related DNA diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, associations between Body Mass Index (BMI) and a variety of candidate genes have been reported, but samples have almost all been limited to adults. The purpose of the present study was to test the developmental origins of some of these associations in a large longitudinal sample of children.\nFor 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes reported to be associated with BMI in adults, we examined associations with BMI in a sample of 5000 children (2500 twin pairs) with BMI data at 4, 7 and 10 years. Association analyses were performed using the Quantitative Transmission Disequilibrium Test and we corrected for multiple testing using the False Discovery Rate.\nDespite having 80% power to detect associations that account for as little as 0.2% of the variance of BMI, none of the 10 SNPs were significantly associated with BMI at any age, although two SNPs showed trends in the expected direction.\nThe lack of association for these ten previously reported associations, despite our large sample size, is typical of associations between candidate genes and complex traits. However, some of the reported SNP associations with BMI might emerge as we continue to follow the sample into adolescence and adulthood. This report highlights the importance of developmentally appropriate candidate genes.",

    "abstract": "To examine the nature of hemispheric lateralization for neural processes underlying verbal fluency and visuo-spatial attention, we investigated a single pair of handedness discordant monozygotic (MzHd) twins. Imaging of the brain was undertaken using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in combination with manual performance tasks. The twins were discordant for MRI anatomical asymmetries of the pars triangularis and planum temporale, whose asymmetry was consistent with verbal laterality on fMRI. Thus, the right-handed twin had left lateralized verbal with right lateralized visuo-spatial attention, while the left-handed twin had right lateralized verbal with left lateralized visuo-spatial activation; these data lend further support for to the conclusions of Sommer et al.",

    "abstract": "Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a rare but serious clinical constellation that occurs in up to 35 % of monochorionic twin pregnancies. In TTTS, transplacental vascular anastomosis results in a net transfusion from one twin to the other, leading to multiple postnatal complications. We report on two sets of immature twins with TTTS and isolated small bowel perforation with consecutive NEC.\nThe gestational age of the male twins was 25 weeks and the gestational age of the female twins was 27 weeks; the mean birth weight was 560 g in the male and 780 g in the female twins. An assessment of the clinical history, including radiological and intraoperative findings and the postmortem examination is given.\nAll 4 infants developed NEC with perforation of the distal ileum. Surgical intervention was performed in all 4 children. Three of the four children died due to complications of TTTS with consecutive NEC and septicemia.\nThe most common explanation for NEC in TTTS is hypoperfusion of the gastrointestinal tract with consecutive hypoxemic damage, especially in the donor twin. In this report, a combination of immaturity and TTTS contributed to intestinal hypoperfusion and concomitant NEC. The pediatric surgeon should be aware of this complication and we recommend proactive surgical management in cases of TTTS.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic 3.5-year-old twin boys presented for developmental assessment with a history of global developmental delay, behavioral issues including self-harm, and severe receptive and expressive language delays. Chromosome testing confirmed for both a 17p11.2 interstitial microdeletion commonly seen in Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), which is characterized by developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and facial and behavioral phenotype. To our knowledge, this is the first description in the literature of monozygotic twins with SMS. Despite their zygosity, the twins had marked differences in presentation including cardiac and renal anomalies, language development, and behavioral phenotype. Both twins displayed disordered speech development, impairments in social interaction, and stereotyped behaviors consistent with autism spectrum disorder, common in the vast majority of cases of SMS. Examining the differences in behavioral and clinical phenotype in monozygotic twins may lead to a better understanding of the cause of the clinical variability seen in SMS, as well as the natural history of this syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Several small studies combined have suggested that twins develop fewer childhood cancers than singletons. The national Swedish Family-Cancer Database contains information on a large population of multiple births providing an unbiased dataset for the estimation of cancer risk in twins. Lifelong cancer incidence in these twins has already been reported as similar to that in singleton births. In contrast, the present paper presents robust estimates of a significantly reduced childhood cancer risk in twins to age 15.\nStandardised incidence ratios (SIR) were used to measure cancer risk for twins, taking the corresponding rates for singletons as reference. Rates were adjusted for age, sex, period of birth, and residential area. Follow up data cover the period 1958-2002.\nOverall childhood cancer risk was significantly reduced in all twins (SIR 0.81 [95% CI: 0.69-0.94]) as was the risk for Wilms tumour (SIR 0.34 [95% CI: 0.09-0.88]). These significant reductions in risk were both driven by effects in same sex twins (overall cancer SIR 0.77 [95% CI: 0.64-0.93], Wilms tumour 0.12 [95% CI: 0.00-0.71]). Leukaemia risk was also significantly reduced for same sex twins (SIR 0.69 [95% CI: 0.47-0.97]).\nOur study provides the evidence that twins experience less childhood cancer than singletons. The risk reduction is most marked for Wilms tumour but may, to a varying extent, be true for a number of childhood neoplasms.",

    "abstract": "Female sex hormones have been suggested to increase the risk of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms via a relaxing effect on the lower esophageal sphincter. We investigated the relationship of oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) to risk of reflux symptoms, controlling for genetic factors and body mass.\nInformation on exposures and reflux symptoms was obtained by telephone interviews conducted in 1998-2002 among women in the Swedish Twin Registry. Use of oral contraceptives was also assessed in 1973 by questionnaires. Both cross-sectional and prospective nested case-control designs were used, each with external control analysis. The cross-sectional design was further submitted to monozygotic co-twin control analysis.\nThe cross-sectional study design comprised 4365 twins with reflux and 17,321 without. In ever users of estrogen HT, the risk of reflux symptoms was increased by 32% (odds ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.47). This association remained in the nested case-control analyses and increased slightly with higher body mass index. A similar pattern was observed for the use of progestin in the cross-sectional design, but no association remained in the nested case-control analysis. Use of oral contraceptives was not associated with an increased risk of reflux symptoms. Generally, the risk estimates remained virtually unchanged after adjustments for potential confounding factors, including genetic factors.\nThis population-based twin study indicates that estrogen HT is an independent risk factor for reflux symptoms, while the influence of progestin HT and oral contraceptives is less consistent.",

They were treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) with no effect (twin A) and almost no effect (twin B). Both twins improved with initiation of olanzapine therapy. Twin B showed a marked improvement by week 2 on a dose of 10 mg daily (qd). Improvement in twin A was seen by week 4 on a dose of 15 mg qd. Twin B was discharged after 8 weeks and twin A after 11 weeks of olanzapine treatment.

    "abstract": "The personality disorders (PDs) in the 'dramatic' cluster B [antisocial (ASPD), histrionic (HPD), narcissistic (NPD) and borderline (BPD)] demonstrate co-morbidity. However, the degree to which genetic and/or environmental factors influence their co-occurrence is not known and, with the exception of ASPD, the relative impact of genetic and environmental risk factors on liability to the cluster B PDs has not been conclusively established.\nPD traits were assessed in 1386 Norwegian twin pairs between the age of 19 and 35 years using the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders (SIDP-IV). Using the statistical package Mx, multivariate twin models were fitted to dimensional representations of the PDs.\nThe best-fitting model, which did not include sex or shared family environment effects, included common genetic and environmental factors influencing all four dramatic PD traits, and factors influencing only ASPD and BPD. Heritability was estimated at 38% for ASPD traits, 31% for HPD traits, 24% for NPD traits and 35% for BPD traits. BPD traits had the lowest and ASPD traits the highest disorder-specific genetic variance.\nThe frequently observed co-morbidity between cluster B PDs results from both common genetic and environmental influences. Etiologically, cluster B has a 'substructure' in which ASPD and BPD are more closely related to each other than to the other cluster B disorders.",

    "abstract": "Twin growth studies are mostly based on pooled data without consideration of zygosity, parental heights or birth weight.\nThe study investigated the effects of gender, zygosity, parental height and birth weight on subsequent twin growth.\nHeight and weight measurements of 1533 twins (n = 1077 for occipito-frontal head circumference (OFC)), age range 2-9 years, were converted to standard deviation scores derived from singleton standards. Their growth was evaluated in relation to gender, zygosity, parental heights and birth weight.\nMean stature of twins fell only slightly below the reference values of singletons, but they were underweight to a greater extent (boys more than girls). Twins' OFC were low (girls more so than boys). Monozygotic (MZ) twin boys were lighter and shorter than dizygotic twins and MZ twin girls. Deficient growth was most evident in those babies light at birth. Parental heights only partly accounted for the difference in height of twins.\nBirth weight and parental height are important in relation to subsequent growth. Boy twins are at a disadvantage compared with girls in terms of their growth in height and weight, particularly in the low birth weight and MZ groups.",

    "abstract": "Leukocyte telomere length, representing the mean length of all telomeres in leukocytes, is ostensibly a bioindicator of human aging. The authors hypothesized that shorter telomeres might forecast imminent mortality in elderly people better than leukocyte telomere length. They performed mortality analysis in 548 same-sex Danish twins (274 pairs) aged 73-94 years, of whom 204 pairs experienced the death of one or both co-twins during 9-10 years of follow-up (1997-2007). From the terminal restriction fragment length (TRFL) distribution, the authors obtained the mean TRFL (mTRFL) and the mean values of the shorter 50% (mTRFL(50)) and shortest 25% (mTRFL(25)) of TRFLs in the distribution and computed the mode of TRFL (MTRFL). They analyzed the proportions of twin pairs in which the co-twin with the shorter telomeres died first. The proportions derived from the intrapair comparisons indicated that the shorter telomeres predicted the death of the first co-twin better than the mTRFL did (mTRFL: 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.49, 0.63; mTRFL(50): 0.59, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.66; mTRFL(25): 0.59, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.66; MTRFL: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.67). The telomere-mortality association was stronger in years 3-4 than in the rest of the follow-up period, and it grew stronger with increasing intrapair difference in all telomere parameters. Leukocyte telomere dynamics might help explain the boundaries of the human life span.",

    "abstract": "Although genetic and environmental influences on behavior problems in middle childhood and adolescence have been well-studied, little is known about the etiology of behavior problems in very early childhood. The present study explores genetic and environmental contributions to individual differences in behavior problems and competences in an infant-toddler sample of twins. There were 1,950 twin pairs (mean age=23.8 months) who were rated by parents on the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment. All four domains (Externalizing, Internalizing, Dysregulation, Competence) and 20 subscales-indices on the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment displayed significant heritability. There were also substantial shared environmental influences operating on most of the domains and subscales. Compared with behavior problems, behavioral competencies were less heritable and more influenced by shared environments.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the individual fetal weight/estimated placental weight ratios (F/P ratio) of the two fetuses in monochorionic (MC) twins with selective intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).\nMC twin with selective IUGR was defined as an estimated fetal weight below the 10th percentile in one twin of MC pregnancy. The estimated individual placental weight was obtained by cutting the placenta along the vascular equator into two territories. A total of 15 MC twins with selective IUGR and 18 MC twins without selective IUGR were included in this study.\nThe individual F/P ratio in the IUGR twin is significantly higher than that in the appropriate for gestational age (AGA) one in MC twin with selective IUGR (6.4 vs 4.0 respectively, p < 0.001). In MC twin without IUGR, the F/P ratios are not significantly different between the two fetuses (5.4 vs 5.1, respectively).\nThe high F/P ratio in the IUGR twin in MC with selective IUGR may be due to the placental reserve phenomenon, so that a smaller placental territory may suffice to perfuse the IUGR twin. In other words, in MC twin gestations with an IUGR twin, the fetal weights are not proportional to the placental masses.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in tooth shape and size are related to impaired esthetic appearance and facial harmony and can have a negative effect on a patient's self-esteem. Many alternatives for treating peg-shaped teeth are described in the literature. This article presents two clinical cases involving peg-shaped lateral incisors that were transformed with composite resins, addressing aspects related to treatment alternatives and facial esthetics. At a seven-year recall visit, the composite resins were problem-free and the patients remained very happy with the treatment outcome. Composite resin appears to be an adequate alternative to direct treatment options for restoring peg-shaped incisors.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have described the relationships between cervical column morphology and craniofacial morphology. The aims of the present study were to describe cervical column morphology in 38 pairs of adult monozygotic (MZ) twins, and compare craniofacial morphology in twins with fusions with craniofacial morphology in twins without fusion. Visual assessment of cervical column morphology and cephalometric measurements of craniofacial morphology were performed on profile radiographs. In the cervical column, fusion between corpora of the second and third vertebrae was registered as fusion. In the twin group, 8 twin pairs had fusion of the cervical column in both individuals within the pair (sub-group A), 25 pairs had no fusions (subgroup B), and in 5 pairs, cervical column morphology was different within the pair (subgroup C), as one twin had fusion and the other did not. Comparison of craniofacial profiles showed a tendency to increased jaw retrognathia, larger cranial base angle, and larger mandibular inclination in subgroup A than in subgroup B. The same tendency was observed within subgroup C between the individual twins with fusion compared with those without fusion. These results confirm that cervical fusions and craniofacial morphology may be interrelated in twins when analysed on profile radiographs. The study also documents that differences in cervical column morphology can occur in individuals within a pair of MZ twins. It illustrates that differences in craniofacial morphology between individuals within a pair of MZ twins can be associated with cervical fusion.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined the effects of chorionicity of twins on variations of height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) during childhood in the classical twin design. Mothers of 81 pairs of monochorionic monozygotic (MCMZ), 47 pairs of dichorionic monozygotic (DCMZ), and 457 pairs of dizygotic (DZ) twins drawn from the South Korean Twin Registry reported their children's height and weight. Twins' age ranged from 1.9 to 8.7 yrs, with a mean of 4.0 yrs and SD of 1.7 yrs. We computed maximum likelihood twin correlations and performed model-fitting analyses. In correlational and model-fitting analyses, we treated age and sex as covariates to control their main effects. Maximum likelihood MCMZ, DCMZ, and DZ twin correlations were, respectively, .96, .92, and .74, for height, .88, .91, and .57 for weight, and .93, .92, and .61 for BMI. The pattern of these twin correlations suggested very modest chorion effects on body measures. Model-fitting analyses confirmed the observations from twin correlations. Whereas genetic and shared environmental influences were significant for all three body measures, chorion effects attained statistical significance only for height (4%), and those for weight and BMI were zero. These findings indicate that genetic and environmental estimates for height, weight, and BMI during childhood are biased little by the chorion type of MZ twins, supporting the validity of the equal prenatal environment assumption in the classical twin design.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies of diabetes mellitus can help elucidate genetic and environmental factors in etiology and can provide valuable biological samples for testing functional hypotheses, for example using expression and methylation studies of discordant pairs. We searched the volunteer Australian Twin Registry (19,387 pairs) for twins with diabetes using disease checklists from nine different surveys conducted from 1980-2000. After follow-up questionnaires to the twins and their doctors to confirm diagnoses, we eventually identified 46 pairs where one or both had type 1 diabetes (T1D), 113 pairs with type 2 diabetes (T2D), 41 female pairs with gestational diabetes (GD), 5 pairs with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and one pair with MODY. Heritabilities of T1D, T2D and GD were all high, but our samples did not have the power to detect effects of shared environment unless they were very large. Weight differences between affected and unaffected cotwins from monozygotic (MZ) discordant pairs were large for T2D and GD, but much larger again for discordant dizygotic (DZ) pairs. The bivariate genetic analysis (under the multifactorial threshold model) estimated the genetic correlation between body mass index (BMI) and T2D to be 0.46, and the environmental correlation at only 0.06.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation differences between identical twins could account for phenotypic twin discordance of behavioral traits and diseases. High throughput epigenomic microarray profiling can be a strategy of choice for identification of epigenetic differences in phenotypically different monozygotic (MZ) twins. Epigenomic profiling of a pair of MZ twins with quantified measures of psychometric discordance identified several DNA methylation differences, some of which may have developmental and behavioral implications and are consistent with the contrasting psychometric profiles of the twins. In particular, differential methylation of CpG islands proximal to the homeobox DLX1 gene could modulate stress responses and risk taking behavior, and deserve further attention as a potential marker of aversion to danger. The epigenetic difference detected at DLX1 of approximately 1.2 fold change was used to evaluate experimental design issues such as the required numbers of technical replicates. It also enabled us to estimate the power this technique would have to detect a functionally relevant epigenetic difference given a range of 1 to 50 twin pairs. We found that use of epigenomic microarray profiling in a relatively small number (15-25) of phenotypically discordant twin pairs has sufficient power to detect 1.2 fold epigenetic changes.",

Familial adversity was defined as the presence of 7 risk factors during perinatal and postnatal development (eg, at 6 and 19 months of age): maternal smoking during pregnancy, low birth weight, low family income, low maternal educational level, single parenthood, young motherhood, and maternal hostile or reactive behaviors.

A total of 346 twins, 130 monozygotic and 216 dizygotic, were included in the study.\nSalivary cortisol samples were collected before and after the participating twins had been exposed to unfamiliar situations; change in cortisol over time was used as a measure of cortisol reactivity.\nDistinct patterns of genetic and environmental contributions to cortisol reactivity were evidenced as a function of familial adversity, suggesting a possible gene-environment interplay.

By contrast, in conditions of high familial adversity, both shared and unique environmental factors, but not genetic factors, accounted for the variance in cortisol reactivity.\nThis pattern of differing genetic and environmental contributions according to familial adversity suggests that, early in life, high familial adversity may have a programming developmental effect on cortisol reactivity.",

    "abstract": "With the number of people with dementia increasing, identifying potential protective factors has become more important. We explored the association between physical exercise at midlife and subsequent risk of dementia among members of the HARMONY study.\nMeasures of exercise were obtained by the Swedish Twin Registry an average of 31 years prior to dementia assessment. Dementia was diagnosed using a two-stage procedure--screening for cognitive impairment followed by full clinical evaluation. We used two study designs: case-control analyses included 264 cases with dementia (176 had Alzheimer's disease) and 2870 controls; co-twin control analyses included 90 twin pairs discordant for dementia.\nIn case-control analyses, controlling for age, sex, education, diet (eating fruits and vegetables), smoking, drinking alcohol, body mass index, and angina, light exercise such as gardening or walking and regular exercise involving sports were associated with reduced odds of dementia compared to hardly any exercise (odds ratio [OR] = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43-0.91 for light exercise; OR = 0.34, 95% CI, 0.16-0.72 for regular exercise). Findings were similar for Alzheimer's disease alone. In co-twin control analyses, controlling for education, the association between higher levels of exercise and lower odds of dementia approached significance (OR = 0.50, 95% CI, 0.23-1.06; p =.072).\nExercise at midlife may reduce the odds of dementia in older adulthood, suggesting that exercise interventions should be explored as a potential strategy for delaying disease onset.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this study were to determine the relative influence of genetic and environmental contributions to inflammatory biomarkers, and to what extent correlations among these markers are due to genetic or environmental factors.\nWe performed univariate and multivariate genetic analyses of four inflammatory markers: interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen, in 166 (88 monozygotic and 78 dizygotic) middle-aged male twin pairs.\nThe mean age (+/-S.D.) of the twins was 54 (+/-2.93) years. Heritability was substantial for CRP (0.61, 95% CI: 0.47-0.72) and moderate to fair for IL-6 (0.31, 0.13-0.46), sIL-6R (0.49, 0.30-0.76) and fibrinogen (0.52, 0.34-0.65). IL-6, CRP and fibrinogen showed significant correlations, but not with sIL-6R. Multivariate genetic analysis found that these correlations could be best explained by a common pathway model, where the common factor explained 27%, 73% and 25% of the variance of IL-6, CRP and fibrinogen, respectively. About 46% (95% CI: 21-64%) of the correlations among the three inflammatory markers could be explained by the genetic factors. After adjusting for covariates known to influence inflammation levels, heritability estimates were slightly decreased but the overall results remained similar.\nA significant part of the variation in inflammatory marker levels is due to genetic influences. Furthermore, almost 50% of the shared variance among these biomarkers is due to a common genetic factor which likely plays a key role in the regulation of inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The influence of non-additive genetic influences on personality traits has been increasingly reported in adult populations. Less is known, however, with respect to younger samples. In this study, we examine additive and non-additive genetic contributions to the personality trait of extraversion in 1,689 Dutch twin pairs, 1,505 mothers and 1,637 fathers of the twins. The twins were on average 15.5 years (range 12-18 years). To increase statistical power to detect non-additive genetic influences, data on extraversion were also collected in parents and simultaneously analyzed. Genetic modeling procedures incorporating age as a potential modifier of heritability showed significant influences of additive (20-23%) and non-additive genetic factors (31-33%) in addition to unshared environment (46-48%) for adolescents and for their parents. The additive genetic component was slightly and positively related to age. No significant sex differences were found for either extraversion means or for the magnitude of the genetic and environmental influences. There was no evidence of non-random mating for extraversion in the parental generation. Results show that in addition to additive genetic influences, extraversion in adolescents is influenced by non-additive genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the interplay between genetic factors influencing baseline level and changes in BMI in adulthood.\nA longitudinal twin study of the cohort of Finnish twins (N = 10,556 twin individuals) aged 20-46 years at baseline was conducted and followed up 15 years. Data on weight and height were obtained from mailed surveys in 1975, 1981, and 1990.\nLatent growth models revealed a substantial genetic influence on BMI level at baseline in males and females (heritability (h(2)) 80% (95% confidence interval 0.79-0.80) for males and h(2) = 82% (0.81, 0.84) for females) and a moderate-to-high influence on rate of change in BMI (h(2) = 58% (0.50, 0.69) for males and h(2) = 64% (0.58, 0.69) for females). Only very weak evidence for genetic pleiotropy was observed; the genetic correlation between baseline and rate of change in BMI was very modest (-0.070 (-0.13, -0.068) for males and 0.04 (0.00, 0.08) for females.\nOur population-based results provide a basis for identifying genetic variants for change in BMI, in particular weight gain. Furthermore, they demonstrate for the first time that such genetic variants for change in BMI are likely to be different from those affecting level of BMI.",

    "abstract": "Structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 308 twins, 64 singleton siblings of twins, and 228 singletons were analyzed using structural equation modeling and selected multivariate methods to identify genetically mediated intracortical associations. Principal components analyses (PCA) of the genetic correlation matrix indicated a single factor accounting for over 60% of the genetic variability in cortical thickness. When covaried for mean global cortical thickness, PCA, cluster analyses, and graph models identified genetically mediated fronto-parietal and occipital networks. Graph theoretical models suggest that the observed genetically mediated relationships follow small world architectural rules. These findings are largely concordant with other multivariate studies of brain structure and function, the twin literature, and current understanding on the role of genes in cortical neurodevelopment.",

    "abstract": "We present the first report of complete hydatidiform mole (HM) with coexisting dichorionic diamniotic twins. This pregnancy was achieved after testicular sperm extraction and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for azoospermia in the woman's husband. Standard in vitro fertilization may cause multisperm fertilization and increase triploid partial HM and complete HM, which arise from dispermic fertilization. In contrast, ICSI can avoid multisperm fertilization. In our case, paternal isodisomy in the molar tissue was confirmed by microsatellite analysis suggesting that it resulted from duplication of a haploid paternal genome following monospermic fertilization of an inactivated oocyte or from monospermic fertilization of an inactivated oocyte with a diploid sperm. Although the patient was eager to continue the pregnancy, the size of the HM component increased rapidly and termination of the pregnancy was required for pre-eclampsia-like symptoms at 15 weeks of gestation. After the operation, chemotherapy was initiated for persistent trophoblastic disease.",

    "abstract": "A nationwide unselected twin population to estimate the relative importance of genetic and environmental effectors in the aetiopathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA).\nThe study comprised three Danish nationwide twin cohorts. In 1994 and 2002 a total of 37 388 and 46 418 Danish twin individuals respectively were asked by questionnaire if they had PsA. Twins reporting PsA were invited to participate in a clinical examination. Patients were classified according to the Moll and Wright and the CASPAR (ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic ARthritis) criteria. Heritability was estimated by probandwise concordance rates and variance component analysis.\n228 twin individuals reported PsA. Following diagnostic validation in 164 (70%), 50 probands were diagnosed with PsA according to the Moll and Wright criteria. Five of their co-twins were either dead, had emigrated, or did not participate in the twin study and nine did not respond, resulting in 36 complete pairs. A total of one of 10 monozygotic pairs and one of 26 dizygotic pairs were concordant for PsA, yielding a 6.2% difference in proportions (95% CI: -11%, 37%). Five of 10 monozygotic pairs and four of 26 dizygotic pairs were concordant for psoriatic skin disease implying a 35% difference (95% CI: 2%, 60%, p<0.05).\nThis first twin study on PsA confirms that genes are important in the causation of psoriatic skin disease. Despite the limited statistical power, the almost identical concordance rates for PsA in monozygotic and dizygotic twins stresses the importance of the continued search for non-genetic effectors in PsA.",

    "abstract": "Apert syndrome results almost exclusively from one of two point mutations (Ser252Trp or Pro253Arg) in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2. Most patients with Apert syndrome have this as an autosomal dominant abnormality. The majority of cases are sporadic, resulting from new mutations. Although there have been some descriptions of familial Apert syndrome, we could find only one previous description in the English literature about twinning in Apert syndrome. This report demonstrates monozygotic twins affected by Apert syndrome with both boys having the Ser252Trp mutation. Although the general constellation of clinical findings was characteristic for Apert syndrome, this case report is unique since the twins had different craniofacial and hand features. One of our twins had a metopic synostosis while Apert syndrome is often characterized by the large metopic suture that closes much later when compared to normal children.",

    "abstract": "Perinatal stroke may affect cognitive development, but few studies have addressed the details of cognitive function after perinatal stroke. The present study was designed to compare the neuropsychologic features of five sets of twins discordant for perinatal stroke. All of the affected children had unilateral middle cerebral artery infarction (two left, three right); four of the five infarcts were large-branch, affecting the entire M1 territory. Three of the five affected children had comorbid epilepsy. Measures of intelligence, memory, language, attention, executive function, visual-motor integration, and fine motor skills were administered to children at a median age of 5 years (range, 5-8 years). Relative to their unaffected co-twins, the twins with perinatal stroke exhibited lower levels of full scale (p=0.005), verbal (p=0.006), and nonverbal (p=0.005) intelligence. Children with perinatal stroke also showed significant deficits on tests of verbal memory (p=0.041), receptive language (p=0.011), verbal fluency (p=0.019), and visual attention (p=0.011), compared with their unaffected co-twins. Twin gestation may be a risk factor for poor cognitive outcome after perinatal stroke. Large infarct size and comorbid epilepsy may have contributed to some of the poor cognitive outcomes in this cohort.",

    "abstract": "Growth is a complex process, and only little is known on the genetic regulation of it. We analyzed the effect of genetic and environmental factors on growth in a longitudinal Swedish cohort of 231 monozygotic and 144 dizygotic twin pairs born 1973-1979 with length or height measured annually from birth to age 18. The data were analyzed by two different multivariate variance component models for twin data using the Mx statistical package. At birth and 1 year of age, a substantial part of the variation in length was because of common environment (50 and 57%, respectively) and the effect of genetic factors was minor. After 2 years of age, 91-97% of the variation of height could be explained by genetic differences whereas the rest was because of environmental variation not shared by twins. The genetic correlation between heights at ages 2 and 18 was 0.73 (95% confidence intervals 0.68-0.77) showing that 53% of the genes affecting height at these ages are the same or closely linked; with increasing age the correlation with genetic effects at age 18 become subsequently stronger. Especially in mid-childhood, growth was largely regulated by the same genetic factors. During puberty new genetic factors started to affect height, but also genetic variation affecting height at previous ages remained. These results suggest that genetic regulation of growth is rather uniform, which is encouraging for further efforts to identify genes affecting growth.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies of BMI on the basis of Asian twins are extremely rare. Eight hundred eighty-eight pairs of twins [279 monozygotic (MZ) and 82 dizygotic (DZ) pairs of male twins, 319 MZ and 82 DZ pairs of female twins, and 126 opposite-sex pairs of DZ twins] completed items concerning height and weight through a mail and a telephone survey. A general sex-limitation model was applied to the data. Heritability estimate was greater among women than among men. However, there was little evidence of sex-specific genes. Under the best-fitting model, additive genetic variances were 82% [95% confidence interval (CI): 72% to 95%] for men and 87% (95% CI: 77% to 99%) for women; shared environmental variances were negligible in both men and women. These estimates of genetic and environmental factors in BMI found among South Korean adolescent twins were broadly in the range of those reported in previous studies of BMI based on Western twin samples.",

    "abstract": "The aim is to compare naturally conceived twins with twins conceived by assisted reproductive techniques (ART) by means of perinatal outcome, behavioural patterns and psychomotor development.\nThree hundred and five spontaneous and 119 assisted twins were compared in aspects of behavioural patterns, mental and psychomotor development, as well as maternal and gestational age, foetal presentation, birth weight, sex, Apgar scores, perinatal complications, delivery route, and admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) RESULTS: Although the maternal age was higher in assisted twins, the mean gestational age and birth weight of assisted twins were significantly less than those of spontaneous twins. The assisted twins did not differ from the naturally conceived twins in aspects of presentation, Apgar scores, admission to NICU and perinatal complications. However, caesarean section rate and the delivery rate of male foetuses were significantly higher in assisted twins. During the first year of life, retardation in mental and psychomotor development was more pronounced in assisted twins. Also assisted twins experienced behavioural problems and difficulties in parent-child interactions more frequently.\nAlthough twins born to assisted pregnancies had significantly shorter duration of gestation and thus less birth weight, their perinatal outcome was similar to that of spontaneous twins. The mothers of assisted twins may be keener on getting intensive prenatal care, which might in turn help to diminish any possible maternal and foetal risks. However, assisted twins showed significantly retarded psychomotor and mental development and experienced problems with environmental factors more frequently during their first year.",

    "abstract": "To investigate environmental factors that protect against or exacerbate obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms, we selected 25 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant, 17 MZ twin pairs concordant high and 34 MZ pairs concordant low on OC symptoms from a large longitudinal Dutch sample of adult twin pairs and their family members, applying stringent criteria for OC symptomatology. Data were collected on psychopathology, family structure, health, lifestyle, birth complications and life events. Unique environmental factors were studied using within-discordant MZ pair comparisons, whereas between-concordant MZ pair comparisons were used to study environmental factors that are shared by the twins of an MZ pair. The high-scoring MZ twins of the discordant group reported more life events (especially sexual abuse) than their low-scoring twin-siblings. The between-pair comparisons showed lower birth weight in the discordant MZ pairs than in the concordant MZ pairs. Further, the concordant high MZ pairs as well as their spouses had a lower educational level than the two other groups. On scale scores of anxious-depression, neuroticism, and somatic complaints, concordant high MZ pairs showed highest scores, and the discordant MZ pairs scored intermediate, except for neuroticism, on which the high-scoring twins of discordant MZ pairs were equal to the concordant high pairs. Discordance on psychological scale scores between the concordant MZ pairs was evident from 1991 onward, and within the discordant MZ pairs from 1997 onward, confirming previous reports of an association of early-onset OC symptoms with higher genetic load. Parent scores of OC symptoms and anxious-depression suggested intermediate genetic load in the discordant MZ group. In conclusion, this study reports on both unique and shared environmental factors associated with OC symptomatology. Whether these factors operate in addition to or in interaction with genetic disposition is to be elucidated in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Gastroschisis is a congenital malformation characterized by an abdominal wall defect located laterally to a normal umbilicus. The cause of gastroschisis is unknown, but most authors consider it exogenous. We describe the case of a woman with a twin pregnancy in which both twins had gastroschisis.\nA 17-year-old primiparous female was referred to our institution because of a twin pregnancy, with one twin diagnosed with gastroschisis at 34 weeks of gestation. Unfortunately, gastroschisis was noted in both twins, but no other anomalies were observed under level II sonographic evaluation. The twins were delivered by cesarean section at 36+ weeks of gestation because of preterm labor and breech presentation of one fetus. Both twins presented with a 3-cm abdominal wall defect located to the right side of the umbilicus and a large portion of the bowel protruding that was not covered by membrane. Histopathology of the placenta revealed that the twins were diamniotic monochorionic. Chromosomal analysis of cord blood showed normal karyotype (46,XX) in both newborns.\nThe cause of gastroschisis is unknown, although possible exogenous causes have been studied. The diagnosis of gastroschisis in twin pregnancy is always in late gestation. Therefore, maternal serum alpha fetoprotein screening and a detailed prenatal ultrasound evaluation are recommended in multifetal pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "There are no data on whether parents of twins will disclose mode of conception to researchers or to their children, who will be informants in adulthood. We sent 1600 questionnaires about this via the Victorian branch of the Australian Multiple Birth Association, to be returned anonymously. Parents were asked how their twins were conceived and whether those who used assisted conception would disclose this to researchers studying assisted conception, twin pregnancy or twin children, or to their children. Comments were invited. Altogether 975 (61%) questionnaires were returned and 389 (40%) indicated use of some form of assisted conception: 75 (19%) ovarian stimulation alone, 165 (42%) In Vitro Fertilisation, 132 (34%) Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection, and 17 (4%) Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer, with 20 reporting use of donor eggs and thirteen donor sperm. Of those using assisted conception, the proportion reporting that they would not, or may not, tell researchers was 5% for assisted conception studies, 6% for twin pregnancy studies, and 7% for studies of twin children, while 7% reported that they would not, or may not, tell their children. From the comments (from 374/975; 38%) it was clear that questions about mode of conception can be offensive to some parents of twins, unless there is a need to know. Further, the question 'are your twins natural?' should be avoided. We believe the question 'Did you need medical help to conceive your twins', followed up with specific questions, is more acceptable.",

    "abstract": "The equal environments assumption, which holds that trait-relevant environments are equally correlated among monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, is essential to twin designs. Violations of this assumption could lead to biased parameter estimates in twin models. A variety of methods and measures have been used to test this assumption. No studies to date have evaluated the measurement invariance of such items or examined the distribution of the underlying equal environments trait. The current study was an investigation of the psychometric properties of a self-report measure of twins' equal environments. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis results indicated that items loaded onto 'child' and 'teen' equal environments factors. Factor loadings and factor variances and their covariance were invariant for MZ and DZ twins; however, DZ twins had significantly lower factor means than MZ twins. Further, these items demonstrated adequate test-retest reliability. Lastly, the child and teen factors may be bimodally distributed, particularly for MZ twin pairs. Measurement invariance issues, as well as distributions of equal environments traits, should be considered when evaluating the equal environments assumption, in order to produce accurate parameter estimates in twin models.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the reliability of obtaining through mailed surveys maternal reports of specific major motor milestones achievement. To accomplish this aim we compared and contrasted mailed survey data and telephone interview data on a series of questions about age at which motor milestones were achieved. We used monthly telephone interviews with mothers of 238 twin pairs, beginning at age 6 months, which ascertained the age at which each specific milestone was met. The contrasting 'through the mail' survey was sent after the second birthday of an independent group of children, and included 463 twin pairs. All twins were born between March 2003 and March 2004. Comparisons were made for the following 5 milestones: sitting without support, hands and knees crawling, turning from back to belly, standing without support, and walking without support. There was no difference between the concurrent telephone interviews and the retrospective through the mail survey on any of the landmarks, except 'standing without support'. From this work we conclude that data on achieving milestones can be reliably obtained through the mail using retrospective surveys when the children are 2 years of age.",

    "abstract": "Oral microbes that colonize in the mouths of humans contribute to disease susceptibility, but it is unclear if host genetic factors mediate colonization. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the levels at which oral microbes colonize in the mouth are heritable. Dental plaque biofilms were sampled from intact tooth surfaces of 118 caries-free twins. An additional 86 caries-active twins were sampled for plaque from carious lesions and intact tooth surfaces. Using a reverse capture checkerboard assay the relative abundance of 82 bacterial species was determined. An integrative computational predictive model determined microbial abundance patterns of microbial species in caries-free twins as compared to caries-active twins. Heritability estimates were calculated for the relative microbial abundance levels of the microbial species in both groups. The levels of 10 species were significantly different in healthy individuals than in caries-active individuals, including, A. defectiva, S. parasanguinis, S. mitis/oralis, S. sanguinis, S. cristatus, S. salivarius, Streptococcus sp. clone CH016, G. morbillorum and G. haemolysans. Moderate to high heritability estimates were found for these species (h(2) = 56%-80%, p < .0001). Similarity of the overall oral microbial flora was also evident in caries-free twins from multivariate distance matrix regression analysis. It appears that genetic and/or familial factors significantly contribute to the colonization of oral beneficial species in twins.",

    "abstract": "Genetically informative data can be used to address fundamental questions concerning the measurement of behavior in children. The authors illustrate this with longitudinal multiple-rater data on internalizing problems in twins. Valid information on the behavior of a child is obtained for behavior that multiple raters agree upon and for rater-specific perception of the child's behavior. Rater-disagreement variance varsigma2(rd) accounted for 35% of the individual differences in internalizing behavior. Up to 17% of this varsigma2(rd) was accounted for by rater-specific additive genetic variance varsigma2(Au). Thus, the disagreement should not be considered only to be bias/error but also as representing the unique feature of the relationships between that parent and the child. The longitudinal extension of this model helps to make a distinction between measurement error and the raters' unique perception of the child's behavior. For internalizing behavior, the results show large stability across time, which is accounted for by common additive genetic and common shared environmental factors. Rater-specific shared environmental factors show substantial influence on stability. This could mean that rater bias may be persistent and affect longitudinal studies.",

    "abstract": "A 45-year-old woman without medical history of cardiovascular disease came to the clinic. She was diagnosed as annuloectasia and aneurysm of ascending aorta and dissected aorta from above the aortic valve to renal artery level (type A). There are no laboratory abnormalities including CBC, biochemistry, and serology tests etc. She does not have any Marfanoid features. Surprisingly, when we reviewed her family history, we realized her monozygotic twin sister performed Bentall operation because of grade III/IV of aortic regurgitation due to annuloectasia and aneurysm of ascending aorta in our hospital 2 years ago. Now she underwent modified Bentall operation and recovered well. Our case suggests that physicians should meticulously check-up the first-order relatives of probands before dissection happens because familial thoracic aortic aneurysms tend to grow at a higher rate.",

Craniopagus are even more rarely encountered and their management is complex particularly in our low-medical-equipment countries. From an observation of craniopagus twins, we present several difficulties in the management of the case. Diagnosis was late; because of the onset of labour, delivery was not prepared; the conditions of neonatal and social management were not adapted. Surgical treatment was not considered owing to the absence of appropriate technological conditions and means.",

    "abstract": "Platelet-type von Willebrand disease (PT-VWD, or pseudo-VWD) and type 2B VWD share a common bleeding phenotype with different etiologies. Both PT-VWD and type 2B VWD represent an enhanced binding between the plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) to its platelet ligand, glycoprotein Ib alpha ( GP1BA). However, type 2B VWD results from a functionally abnormal VWF molecule, whereas PT-VWD is caused by hyperresponsive platelets due to defects in the platelet GP1BA gene. The laboratory discrimination between the two disorders can be a challenge because simple phenotypic testing will not differentially identify the disorders, and the more complex testing approaches are often poorly applied. Definitive diagnosis is critical for treatment decisions and can be most definitively achieved by identifying the gene defect at either the VWF or GP1BA loci. A systematic international molecular genetic study would be helpful to address the question of whether PT-VWD is being misdiagnosed as type 2B VWD. Such a study can be facilitated by an international online database/disease registry to enhance international awareness about this otherwise long-recognized diagnostic dilemma.",

We report a unique case of extremely premature twins, one of whom was ultimately diagnosed with trisomy 21. We were able to examine the neonatal courses and outcomes of these twins, which were similar despite the presence of trisomy 21 in one twin. This is the first report comparing the neonatal course of an infant with trisomy 21 to an unaffected twin in patients born so prematurely, and demonstrates the difficulty of making the diagnosis of trisomy 21 based solely on physical examination in premature infants.",

    "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent psychiatric disorder emerging during childhood. Psychostimulant medications (e.g., methylphenidate) noticeably reduce ADHD symptoms in most children. Since methylphenidate inhibits dopamine transporter activity, the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) was considered to be the prime candidate risk gene in ADHD. Several studies found evidence for an association between the 10-repeat allele of the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) located in the 3' untranslated region and ADHD and/or ADHD symptoms in clinical and population-based samples. However, this finding was not replicated in all samples. In this study, we investigated the association between the DAT1 gene and ADHD symptoms in a population-based twin sample from Qu\u00e9bec (Canada). We used two polymorphisms, the VNTR and rs27072, the last providing the most significant results in a clinical sample from Toronto (Ontario, Canada). No association was noted between the VNTR and ADHD symptoms in children at 6 and 7 years of age, as reported by teachers. However, a significant association was found for the rs27072 polymorphism and symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. These findings indicate that the DAT1 gene contributes to ADHD symptoms in this sample and further suggest that the VNTR may not be the optimal polymorphism for study in all populations.",

Mean unaided visual acuity was 0.0 (6/6). The mean spherical equivalent was +0.87D, and decreased with increasing child age (p<0.01). A prospective analysis, accounting for birth set clustering and relevant confounders, showed increasing levels of maternal smoking in the third trimester was associated with poor stereoacuity on the Titmus test (worse (>) than 100'', p=0.05) and Lang test (p=0.001) and also with the presence of esotropia (p=0.02). These associations persisted after adjustment for infant postnatal smoke exposure at one month of age. Poor stereoacuity on Titmus stereo test circles was associated with late age of first crawling (RR=1.23 (1.06, 1.42) p=0.005 per month) and late age of first walking (RR 1.18 (1.05, 1.22) p=0.001 per month).\nAntenatal smoking was independently associated with poor stereovision and the presence of esotropia.

    "abstract": "We report on monozygotic twins with neonatal onset of daily reflex seizures triggered by hot water. Video record during the hot water bathing showed clinical signs consistent with a reflex seizure. The numbers of episodes were markedly reduced when the mother began bathing the children with reduced temperature bath water. At the age of 20 months, the twins developed episodes of paroxysmal disturbances including alternating hemiplegia. These two patients are the youngest reported cases of reflex hot water seizures, and the only reported cases in which reflex hot water seizures subsequently manifested episodes of alternating hemiplegia.",

    "abstract": "Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we estimated neural activity in twins to study genetic influences on the cortical response to categories of visual stimuli (faces, places, and pseudowords) that are known to elicit distinct patterns of activity in ventral visual cortex. The neural activity patterns in monozygotic twins were significantly more similar than in dizygotic twins for the face and place stimuli, but there was no effect of zygosity for pseudowords (or chairs, a control category). These results demonstrate that genetics play a significant role in determining the cortical response to faces and places, but play a significantly smaller role (if any) in the response to orthographic stimuli.",

However, the twins differed markedly in regard to smoking history; the twin with an approximately 52.5-pack-year smoking history showed more severe skin aging than did the nonsmoking twin.\nThe difference in skin aging illustrated by this twin pair may serve as a motivator for smoking cessation.",

We reviewed the obstetric records of all 171 twin vaginal deliveries at Japanese Red Cross Katsushika Maternity Hospital from January 2002 through August 2006. Of these deliveries, 41 (24%) were complicated by postopartum hemorrhage. Postpartum hemorrhage was significantly more likely in cases with gestational age > or = 39 weeks (odds ratio [OR], 3.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-7.28), a combined birth weight of more than 5,500 g (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.00-6.45), induction of labor (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.38-5.98), oxytocin administration during labor (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.27-6.48), or a duration of labor > or = 24 hours (OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.15-5.62). Postpartum hemorrhage is a frequent complication in twin pregnancies. Therefore, special attention should be given after birth to patients with induction of labor or intervened delivery especially at > or = 39 weeks gestation.",

    "abstract": "Primary amenorrhea is often the first presenting symptom in m\u00fcllerian agenesis. A thorough history and physical examination focusing on pubertal development assist in diagnosis and management. Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH) is the second most common cause of primary amenorrhea with a reported incidence of 1:4000.\nNon-identical 18-year-old twins presented with primary amenorrhea. They both had well developed secondary sexual characteristics, with no menarche. One of the twins complained of lower abdominal pain. They were initially assessed within a primary care setting. They were referred to a secondary care center for further investigations to reach a definite diagnosis and management. Further management was planned within a multidisciplinary approach involving gynecologists, psychologists and surgeons with a special interest in vaginal reconstructive surgery.\nPrimary amenorrhea affects approximately 5% of amenorrheic women. Diagnosis and management are reached by following a diagnostic algorithm. Reports of MRKH in siblings or non-identical twins are rare. We believe this to be the first case of MRKH syndrome to be reported in dichorionic twins.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of genetic factors to schizophrenia is well established and recent studies have indicated several strong candidate genes. However, the pathophysiology of schizophrenia has not been totally elucidated yet. To date, studies of monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia have provided insight into the pathophysiology of this illness; this type of study can exclude inter-individual variability and confounding factors such as effects of drugs. In this study we used DNA microarray analysis to examine the mRNA expression patterns in the lymphoblastoid (LB) cells derived from two pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia. From five independent replicates for each pair of twins, we selected five genes, which included adrenomedullin (ADM) and selenoprotein X1 (SEPX1), as significantly changed in both twins with schizophrenia. Interestingly, ADM was previously reported to be up-regulated in both the LB cells and plasma of schizophrenic patients, and SEPX1 was included in the list of genes up-regulated in the peripheral blood cells of schizophrenia patients by microarray analysis. Then, we performed a genetic association study of schizophrenia in the Japanese population and examined the copy number variations, but observed no association. These findings suggest the possible role of ADM and SEPX1 as biomarkers of schizophrenia. The results also support the usefulness of gene expression analysis in LB cells of monozygotic twins discordant for an illness.",

    "abstract": "To examine trends in incidence of multiple births (MB) and their survival in infancy, we used population-based, longitudinal data derived from the Health and Demographic Surveillance System in Matlab, Bangladesh, from 1975 to 2002. Logistic regression was applied to determine the impact of a number of variables on mortality among MB in the first year of life. MB averaged 2% of all live births, but contributed 10% to all infant deaths. Infant mortality among MB was more than five times higher than among singletons. Mortality among MB declined by 27% in 1975-2002, considerably less than the 51% mortality decline among singletons in the same period. Infant mortality among twins and triplets was particularly high among children who were born to young mothers (<20 years), who were the first live birth, who were born after a short birth interval (<24 months) and whose mothers were unschooled. Mortality of MB was lower in the area with easy access to high-quality maternal and child-care services. Thus, good maternity and newborn care will improve the survival of MB.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown significant sex differences in the pattern of 2D:4D finger length ratios in humans and several other mammalian species. In humans, these ratios are suggested to be negatively correlated with prenatal exposure to testosterone, positively correlated with prenatal estrogen, and exhibit sex specific patterns of association with sexually dimorphic clinical phenotypes. However, the relative contributions of genetic and environmental influences on digit ratios in men and women are currently unknown. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to examine genetic and environmental influences on 2D:4D ratios in twins. Participants included 146 monozygotic (MZ) and 154 dizygotic (DZ) adult male and female twins participating in the Michigan State University Twin Study of Behavioral Adjustment and Development. Overall, biometric model-fitting analyses indicated significant additive genetic and nonshared environmental influences on digit ratios. Findings suggest greater similarity between 2D:4D ratios in MZ relative to DZ twins that can be accounted for by genetic and nonshared environmental factors.",

The acardiac twin does not survive while mortality of the normal twin is about 50-70% as the normal twin has to provide circulation not only for itself but also for acardiac twin. Proper timing of the delivery is of prime importance to the survival of the normal fetus for which emphasis is placed on close sonographic monitoring for early antenatal diagnosis.

    "abstract": "Preterm labor (PTL) in a multiple gestation occurs frequently and is a common reason for preterm delivery (PTD). Management strategies for multiple gestations must be directed at early detection of PTL and effective strategies to delay or prevent PTD. Unlike singleton gestation where identification of patients at risk for PTL is often difficult, every multiple gestation is at risk for PTL, so all patients can be managed as being at risk. Although PTL is a significant cause of PTD, one must recognize that there are other reasons for delivery in multiple gestations. Clinicians must treat the whole patient and extend the pregnancy to the most advanced gestational age possible that is consistent with the best outcome.",

    "abstract": "Various studies have demonstrated an increased risk for adult diseases in newborns born small-for-gestational-age (SGA). Adiponectin and resistin can be detected in cord blood and are suggested to affect insulin resistance (IR). This might represent a link between metabolic syndrome and SGA birth.\nWe investigated the relationship between the adipocytokines and inter-twin birth weight (BW) difference of 31 monozygotic twins with twin-twin transfusion syndrome; in 14 twin pairs BW difference was >15% (1 SGA twin, 1 appropriate-for-gestational-age, AGA, twin).\nBW and length of all patients were positively related to adiponectin (r = 0.57; p < 0.0001; r = 0.47; p < 0.0001) and to resistin (r = 0.31; p < 0.01; r = 0.35; p < 0.01). In 71% (10/14), the SGA twins showed lower adiponectin concentrations than their AGA co-twins (only 6/14 for resistin). To correct for gestational age we calculated the relationship between the intrapair differences (Delta) of BW and Delta of the hormones. We found Delta BW positively correlated with adiponectin (r = 0.55; p < 0.001) but not with resistin (r = 0.22; p = 0.2). Delta adiponectin was positively correlated with Delta resistin (r = 0.45; p < 0.01).\nThese data demonstrate that adiponectin and resistin levels are associated with BW with only adiponectin levels being reduced in SGA children independently of gestational age. Prenatally different metabolic status between the twins might predispose the SGA twin to develop IR later in life.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal abnormalities encompass a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by anomalies of cartilage as well as bone growth and development. Some are lethal and express early during fetal life, making them amenable to prenatal diagnosis.

However, when a skeletal dysplasia is suspected, it is more difficult to establish a specific diagnosis. Moreover, detailed ultrasonographic evaluation of the whole fetal skeleton may be limited in some circumstances, especially during the third trimester due to the fetal position and in the case of multiple pregnancies.\nRetrospective study of twin pregnancies complicated with skeletal abnormalities.\n6 twin pregnancies were reviewed. The prenatal diagnosis was correctly made in 66.66% (4/6) with the primary use of combined 2D and 3D-US. 3D-HCT permits to improve the simultaneous assessment of both fetuses, and is of greater value than US in 16.66% (1/6).\nThe combined use of 2D or 3D-US with 3D-HCT permits the best imaging evaluation.",

SRY gene was investigated by PCR and two-step PCR in peripheral leukocytes and gonadal tissues, respectively. Direct DNA sequencing of the DAX-1 coding sequence was performed. Real-time PCR for SOX9 region on chromosome 17 was obtained.\nBoth twins had a 46,XX karyotype. Twin A had a 1-cm phallus with chordee, penoscrotal hypospadias, and palpable gonads. Serum levels of FSH (2.34 mIU/ml), LH (8.8 mIU/ml), and testosterone (1.6 ng/ml) were normal, and biopsies revealed bilateral testes. Twin B had a 0.5-cm phallus, perineal hypospadias, no palpable gonad on the right, and a left inguinal hernia. Hormonal evaluation revealed high FSH (8.2 mIU/ml) and LH (15 mIU/ml) and low testosterone (0.12 ng/ml). Upon herniotomy, a right testis (crossed ectopia) and a small left ovotestis were found. SRY gene was absent in both peripheral leukocytes and gonadal tissue samples. Neither DAX-1 mutations nor SOX9 duplication was identified.\nThis case provides evidence that both XX maleness and XX OT-DSD are different manifestations of the same disorder of gonadal development.",

    "abstract": "We report the first observation to our knowledge of mirror unilateral keratoconus in monozygotic twins. The observation focuses on monozygotic twins, followed for 5 years. The progression of the refraction, the clinical examination, the video-topographic data, and the Orbscan elevation curves of the twins were collected and analyzed. For each twin, there was slightly progressive unilateral keratoconus during that time, located on the right for the first twin and on the left for the second one. Within the current limits of our diagnostic means, it appears to be the first case of mirror unilateral keratoconus in monozygotic twins. Several cases of mirror pathologies have been described, mainly concerning the renal and dental organs. The appearance of such mirror pathologies may be the consequence of the rise of a genetic or environmental factor during the acquisition of the symmetry of the zygote, occurring before its split into two monozygotic embryos.",

    "abstract": "Selecting the \"correct\" face lift technique has always been a difficult decision for the plastic surgeon. A technique that provides optimal aesthetics for one patient may not provide the same result for another. The complexity of comparing these different results on patients with different facial features further confounds one's ability to decide on a given technique. Even identical twins are often treated more appropriately with a different technique from one twin to the other because the character and severity of facial aging may differ between them. By comparing different superficial musculoaponeurotic system techniques on \"less different\" people (identical twins), perhaps the ideal technique may be determined.\nBetween November of 1997 and April of 1999, eight sets of twins underwent face lift surgery by the senior author (D.E.A.), using one of four techniques. The charts and photographs of the eight consecutive pairs of twins (16 patients) were reviewed retrospectively.\nNo one face lift technique performed in this study produced a superior result as compared with another when performed on the appropriate patient.\nThere exists no face lift technique suitable for every patient. As the current literature suggests, there is no one \"best\" face lift technique of those studied.",

    "abstract": "TCF2, the gene encoding for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1beta, is involved in early renal development. Mutations in TCF2 lead to heterogeneous renal phenotypes. Antenatal ultrasonography may show unilateral/bilateral hyperechogenic or enlarged cystic kidneys. In children or adults, cystic renal hypoplasia/dysplasia is a common feature, occasionally associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 and genital tract abnormalities. We report an unusual presentation characterized by massively enlarged polycystic kidneys mimicking autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in monozygotic twins. Bilateral enlarged cystic kidneys were discovered in week 13 of a gemellic pregnancy. Postnatally, kidney size increased in both children, reaching 16 cm at 20 years. Nephromegaly was associated with bilateral cysts and a slowly decreasing glomerular filtration rate (40 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at 20 years). There was neither pancreatic nor genital malformation. Non-type 1 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed incidentally in both twins at 20 years. Knowledge of early-onset diabetes (at age 19 years) in their father prompted us to search for the TCF2 mutation. Genetic analysis showed complete TCF2 heterozygous whole-gene deletion in both twins. Genetic testing could not be performed in the father. Bilateral massively enlarged polycystic kidneys mimicking autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in young adults may be related to TCF2 mutation. Although uncommon, this new phenotype enlarges the clinical spectrum of kidney involvement associated with TCF2 mutation. In this case, maturity-onset diabetes of the young-type diabetes paved the way to accurate diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Benign natal haemangiomatosis is characterised by the presence of multiple congenital haemangiomas restricted to the skin. It is differentiated from diffuse neonatal haemangiomatosis in which there is both cutaneous and visceral involvement, with higher morbidity and mortality.\nTwo identical twins, I and II (monochorionic placenta, biamniotic), born prematurely at 30 weeks' amenorrhoea, presented twin-transfusion syndrome resulting in retarded intrauterine growth in twin I, the donor, and incipient anasarca in twin II, the recipient. Twin I weighed 960 g while twin II weighed 1 200 g. At birth, miliary haemangiomatosis was observed in both infants (16 haemangiomas in I, 19 in II). Abdominal ultrasound and whole-body MRI performed in the two children revealed multiple angiomatous hepatic nodular lesions in I. Subsequent routine clinical and ultrasound monitoring (hepatic and cardiac) showed increased size of the haemangiomatous lesions over the first 4 months followed by stabilisation and gradual regression. No systemic therapy was required. In twin I an episode of ulceration of a neck haemangioma occurred at 5 months and a favourable outcome was obtained on administration of topical hydrocolloid therapy.\nTwin-transfusion syndrome affects 15 to 30% of monochorionic biamniotic pregnancies. It is a serious complication of twin pregnancies resulting from a dynamic process of interfoetal blood transfusion as a result of venous-venous or arteriovenous vascular anastomoses. In the present case, which appears to be the first reported case, it seems that these monochorionic twins, who shared the same placenta, presented haemangiomatosis simultaneously in utero, if we accept the hypothesis of grafting of emboli of placental microvessels in the formation of congenital haemangiomas.",

    "abstract": "To explore the association between cannabis and personality scores when genetic background and shared environment are controlled for.\nThe co-twin control design. This design provides a powerful method for controlling for the effects of potentially confounding familial factors that may act to predispose subjects both to cannabis use and a particular personality profile.\n118 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for cannabis use.\nData on personality and cannabis use were obtained through a questionnaire survey. The Dutch Sensation Seeking List was used to assess various aspects of sensation seeking. The Amsterdamse Biografische Vragenlijst assessed extraversion, neuroticism, somatic complaints and test attitude.\nThe affected twins scored higher on all scales than their unaffected co-twins, especially on experience seeking (P = 0.004), total sensation seeking score (P = 0.004) and neuroticism (P = 0.039). Differences were also observed when items on drug use were removed from the experience seeking scale (P = 0.037) and total sensation seeking score (P = 0.009) although these differences were no longer significant after Bonferoni correction (P < 0.005).\nCannabis use is associated with a higher score on personality scales. This result was obtained in a sample of monozygotic twins discordant for cannabis use. Thus, at least part of the association between cannabis use and experience seeking cannot be attributed to underlying genetic or shared environmental factors that influence both personality and cannabis use and must be explained by unique environmental influences.",

    "abstract": "Less is known about depression in children than in adults. This study integrates fields by combining cognitive and interpersonal research investigating childhood depression symptoms through the use of a genetic framework. Three research questions are addressed. First, what are the associations among interpersonal cognitions, anxiety, and depression? Second, what are the relative magnitudes of genetic and environmental influences on interpersonal cognitions? Third, to what extent do genetic and environmental influences explain associations between interpersonal cognitions and depression? Three hundred pairs of 8-year-old twins reported on symptoms of depression and anxiety by completing the Children's Depression Inventory and the Screen for Childhood Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders. The authors examined interpersonal cognitions with the Children's Expectation of Social Behaviors and the Perceptions of Peers and Self Questionnaires. Interpersonal cognitions were more strongly correlated with depression (mean r = .35) than with anxiety (mean r = .13). Genetic influence on interpersonal cognitions was small (M = 3%), and associations between interpersonal cognitions and depression were mainly explained by environmental influences. These latter findings may result from interpersonal cognitions in young children, reflecting life experiences as opposed to trait-like cognitive biases.",

    "abstract": "Nonsyndromic clefts of the lip and/or palate are common birth defects with a strong genetic component. Based on unequal gender ratios for clefting phenotypes, evidence for linkage to the X chromosome and the occurrence of several X-linked clefting syndromes, we investigated the role of skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in orofacial clefts. Our samples consisted of female monozygotic (MZ) twins (n = 8) and sister pairs (n = 152) discordant for nonsyndromic clefting. We measured the XCI pattern in peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA using a methylation based androgen receptor gene assay. Skewing of XCI was defined as the deviation in inactivation pattern from a 50:50 ratio. Our analysis revealed no significant difference in the degree of skewing between twin pairs (P = 0.3). However, borderline significant differences were observed in the sister pairs (P = 0.02), with the cleft lip with cleft palate group showing the most significant result (P = 0.01). We did not find evidence for involvement of skewed XCI in the discordance for clefting in our sample of female MZ twins. However, results from the paired sister study suggest the potential contribution of skewed XCI to orofacial clefting, particularly cleft lip and palate.",

    "abstract": "Copper plays an essential role in human physiology and is indispensable for normal growth and development. Enzymes that are involved in connective tissue formation, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, iron transport, and others essential physiological processes require copper as a cofactor to mediate their reactions. The biosynthetic incorporation of copper into these enzymes takes places within the secretory pathway and is critically dependent on the activity of copper-transporting ATPases ATP7A or ATP7B. In addition, ATP7A and ATP7B regulate intracellular copper concentration by removing excess copper from the cell. These two transporters belong to the family of P(1)-type ATPases, share significant sequence similarity, utilize the same general mechanism for their function, and show partial colocalization in some cells. However, the distinct biochemical characteristics and dissimilar trafficking properties of ATP7A and ATP7B in cells, in which they are co-expressed, indicate that specific functions of these two copper-transporting ATPases are not identical. Immuno-detection studies in cells and tissues have begun to suggest specific roles for ATP7A and ATP7B. These experiments also revealed technical challenges associated with quantitative detection of copper-transporting ATPases in tissues, as illustrated here by comparing the results of ATP7A and ATP7B immunodetection in mouse cerebellum.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) are mainly responsible for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) with either a dominant pattern of transmission or a sporadic occurrence due to the reduced penetrance. A majority of LRRK2 kindreds demonstrate an extremely variable age-at-onset in affected members of the same family. The G2019S is the most common LRRK2 mutation, which accounts for 1-5% PD patients in North America, and up to 40% of patients from an isolated Arab population. We assessed the frequency of the G2019S mutation in 83 Brazilian PD patients originally preselected for having an early age-at-onset (<50 years) and/or a positive family history. The mutation was detected in three probands (3.5%). Our clinical findings in these kindreds include the first description of the phenotype in identical twins discordant for handedness (a general phenomenon found in approximately 25% monozygotic twins). However, both twins developed right asymmetric PD. The clinical presentation of twins was strikingly similar including an identical PD onset at age 60. This observation may suggest that genetic factors predominantly determine age-at-onset.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the effect of multifetal pregnancy reduction on the incidence of small for gestational age (SGA) and discordance in reduced versus nonreduced twins and differences in placental pathology. A computerized ultrasound database was used to identify diamniotic-dichorionic twins who delivered at our institution. Reduced (n = 36) versus nonreduced twins (n = 243) were compared for differences in rates of SGA and discordancy (>or= 20%.) The groups were compared for differences in maternal and neonatal characteristics, as well as differences in placental pathology. Chi-square tests were used to compare differences in means. Stepwise logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders including placental pathology. The rate of SGA in either twin A or B remained nonsignificant after adjustment for the use of assisted reproductive technology and gestational age at delivery in the stepwise logistic model (odds ratio, 1.7 95%; confidence interval, 0.5, 5.2). The average discordance at delivery was 12.4% in reduced versus 11.4% in the nonreduced twins ( P = 0.54). We found no overall differences in placental pathology between the two groups. Reduced and nonreduced twins have no significant differences in SGA fetuses, growth discordancy, or placental pathology.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins may be subject to epigenetic modifications that could result in different patterns of gene expression. Several lines of evidence suggest that epigenetic factors may underlie mental disorders such as bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ). One important epigenetic modification, of relevance to female MZ twins, is X-chromosome inactivation. Some MZ female twin pairs are discordant for monogenic X linked disorders because of differential X inactivation. We postulated that similar mechanisms may also occur in disorders with more complex inheritance including BD and SZ. Examination of X-chromosome inactivation patterns in DNA samples from blood and/or buccal swabs in a series of 63 female MZ twin pairs concordant or discordant for BD or SZ and healthy MZ controls suggests a potential contribution from X-linked loci to discordance within twin pairs for BD but is inconclusive for SZ. Discordant female bipolar twins showed greater differences in the methylation of the maternal and paternal X alleles than concordant twin pairs and suggest that differential skewing of X-chromosome inactivation may contribute to the discordance observed for bipolar disorder in female MZ twin pairs and the potential involvement of X-linked loci in the disorder.",

    "abstract": "Smoking initiation and persistence are clearly associated with factors commonly thought to be environmental in origin, including socio-economic status. However, twin models that incorporate gene-environment correlation and gene x environment interaction have not been applied to elucidate the genetic or environmental role that socio-economic status plays in smoking initiation and nicotine dependence.\nTwin structural equation modelling was used to examine gene-environment correlation and gene x environment interaction of one index of socio-economic status, educational attainment, with smoking initiation and nicotine dependence among 5119 monozygotic and 4295 dizygotic male-male Vietnam-era twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, a national registry of twin pairs who served in the military during the Vietnam era.\nEducational attainment correlated significantly with smoking initiation (r=-0.27, p<0.001). Additive genetic (p=0.011), shared environment (p=0.002) and unique environment (p=0.027) components contributed to the correlation between educational attainment and smoking initiation. Educational attainment also significantly moderated the variance in smoking initiation (p<0.001), suggestive of gene x environment interaction, although the interaction with the additive genetic, shared environmental and unique environmental components could not be resolved due to multi-collinearity. In contrast, educational attainment neither correlated with nor moderated nicotine dependence, once smokers had initiated.\nOur study suggests that educational attainment is associated with smoking initiation, in part due to gene-environment correlation and gene x environment interaction. However, once smoking initiation is taken into account, there are no effects--be they gene-environment correlation or gene x environmental interaction--of educational attainment on nicotine dependence.",

    "abstract": "To compare dietary habits between Finnish twin migrants to Sweden and their co-twins always living in Finland, and to analyse how migration influenced food consumption patterns in the migrants.\nSame-sexed twin pairs born in Finland below 75 years of age, with at least one twin migrating to Sweden (n=1083 pairs). Dietary habits were assessed by a food frequency questionnaire included in a comprehensive mailed questionnaire (response rate 71%). For 76 male twin pairs, information was also collected by a dietary history interview inquiring the habitual diet during the previous year.\nMigrant twins in Sweden had a lower intake of typical Finnish foods like dark bread and berries, and an increased consumption of fresh fruit compared with co-twins living in Finland. The migrants consumed less potatoes and more rice and pasta. Sweet pastries were consumed less often by the migrants and they also tended to more often cut out visible fat of meat and on the other hand add salt to dishes. Among men the migrants had a lower alcohol intake than their co-twins living in Finland.\nMigration from Finland to Sweden is associated with differences in the food pattern that reflect population differences in eating habits between the two countries. The differences include a reduced consumption of typical Finnish foods like dark bread and berries and are of bidirectional nature from the point of view of cardiovascular health.",

    "abstract": "Discordance of fetal genotype or phenotype in a monozygotic twin pregnancy is rare.\nIn case 1, a 28-year-old woman at 15 weeks' gestation was found to have a dichorionic twin pregnancy with 1 fetus affected with hydrop fetalis. The result of chromosomal study showed that the structurally normal fetus was 46,XY and that the hydropic fetus was 45,X. One week after selective termination of the hydropic fetus at 19 weeks' gestation, the cotwin died in utero. In case 2, a 30-year-old woman at 20 weeks' gestation, was found to have a monochorionic twin pregnancy with 1 fetus presenting with omphalocele. The result of chromosomal study showed that both fetuses were 46,XX. The fetus with omphalocele died in utero at 29 weeks' gestation, and the normal cotwin was delivered later due to fetal distress. Analysis by short tandem repeat markers in both cases indicated that they were monozygotic twins.\nThese cases emphasize the importance of zygosity/chorionicity identification in twin pregnancy even though discordance of fetal genotype or phenotype was found. In monozygotic monochorionic twins, the normal cotwin is at risk for an adverse fetal outcome after 1 spontaneous intrauterine fetal death or selective termination. In monozygotic dichorionic twins, the risk of intrauterine fetal demise of the cotwin after selective termination still exists.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the association between haplotypes of S447X and Hind III polymorphisms of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene and serum lipids in a population-based twin cohort study in China.\nTwin subjects were collected based on the twin registry system of China. All twins were investigated by a standard questionnaire and physical examinations. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was used to detect the genotypes of S447X and Hind III polymorphisms. Linkage disequilibrium test and haplotypes were estimated between two polymorphisms.\nNine hundred and eighty-seven pairs of twins were eligible for analysis. The two polymorphisms of LPL gene were significantly linkage disequilibrium. In female twins, the H- allele of Hind III polymorphism was significantly related to lower levels of triglycerides(TG) and lower risk of high TG dislipidemia, but those associations disappeared after adjusting the polymorphism of S447X. The H- X haplotype of those two polymorphisms was significantly related to lower TG and TG/HDL (decreasing 12.9% and 14.9% respectively), as well as significantly to lower risk of high TG dislipidemia (OR = 0.40).\nThe haplotypes of S447X and Hind III polymorphisms were significantly related to the favorable effect of lipids,but this effect was mostly determined by the polymorphism of S447X, while the effect of Hind III polymorphism was indirectly influenced by the linkage disequilibrium with S447X polymorphism.",

    "abstract": "We report on the follow-up of a set of monozygotic (MZ) twins who were concordant for peripheral blood karyotype 45,X/46,XY but discordant for phenotypic sex. One twin is a phenotypically normal male and the other twin has asymetrical gonadal dysgenesis. The female twin has the mos45,X/46,XY karyotype in all four tissues: left testis, right streak, vas deferens, and clitoral skin. The normal male twin has the normal 46,XY karyotype in all three tissues tested: foreskin, scrotal skin, and testis. Follow-up of the twins at age 21, revealed persistence of mos45,X/46,XY karyotype in peripheral blood into adult life. However, the male grew up with normal male stature, reaching an adult height of 182 cm. The female twin received low dose estrogen replacement with complete breast development at age 14 years. She reached an adult height of 156 cm. At 21 years of age the male twin had normal testicular endocrine function, but severe oligospermia. The long-term follow-up of this set of MZ twins indicate that the male twin has the mosaicism confined to peripheral blood and has the normal 46,XY male constitution. This was further confirmed by his normal male stature and normal testicular endocrine function. The 45X cell line is likely due to his receiving these cells passively from his twin sister via placental anastomoses in utero. The exposure to these 45,X cells during development may have had an impact on his spermatogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Depression has been associated with decreased blood BDNF concentrations; but it is unclear if low blood BDNF levels are a state or a trait marker of depression.\nWe investigated blood BDNF concentrations in a twin population including both subjects highly predisposed and protected against affective disorder. Whole blood assessed for BDNF concentrations and correlated to risk status, neuroticism, and number of stressful life events.\nBetween the groups, we found no significant difference in whole blood BDNF levels. Women at high-risk for depression who had experienced three or more recent stressful events (n=26) had decreased whole blood BDNF levels compared to high-risk women with two or less recent stressful events (n=35), 21.6+/-7.0 vs. 18.5+/-4.1 ng/ml, respectively, (p<0.05). No such association was found in low-risk women or in men. In men, however, low neuroticism scores and two or less recent stressful events were associated with decreased whole blood BDNF levels (n=50, p<0.05).\nThe cross-sectional design limits the possibility of drawing firm conclusions on causatility of the findings.\nThe genetic risk of developing depression does not translate directly into whole blood BDNF levels. In females who are genetically disposed for depression and subjected to recent stressful life events whole blood BDNF levels are lower.",

We carried out a register based study of all twins (N=3411) and a 5% random sample of singletons (N=7796) born in Denmark 1986-1988. We found no difference in school performance in adolescence between twins and singletons, nor when controlling for birth weight, gestational weight, age of parents or parents' education. Progress within living conditions, obstetrics, and paediatrics may be the reason why twins now generally have school performances similarly to singletons.",

Mothers of 56 pairs of monochorionic monozygotic (MCMZ) twins, 34 pairs of dichorionic monozygotic (DCMZ) twins, and 316 pairs of dizygotic (DZ) twins rated their children's prosocial behavior. The MCMZ correlation for prosocial behavior was similar to the DCMZ correlation (.63 vs. 61), but both correlations were higher than the DZ correlation (.33). Models incorporating the chorion effects were fit to the data. Genetic, shared and nonshared environmental, and chorion effects in the full model were, respectively, 53% (95% CI: 1-70%), 7% (95% CI: 0-37%) , 40% (95% CI: 29-54%), and 0% (95% CI: 0-27%), with the effects of chorion and shared environment being nonsignificant.

    "abstract": "More boys than girls with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) receive treatment. One explanation for this bias may be that boys score higher on disruptive behavior scales than girls. Although this was supported by findings in clinical samples, recent studies in nonreferred samples showed that boys and girls with ADHD are similar with respect to their levels of disruptive behavior as reported by their mother. In this report, we investigate whether the difference in treatment rate is associated with higher teacher problem scores in boys with ADHD than in girls with ADHD. Data were obtained from mothers and teachers in a nonreferred sample of 283 boys and 291 girls with and without ADHD. Children were selected when they scored either low (controls) or high (probands) on attention problems. Mothers completed DSM-IV interviews, Child Behavior Checklists (CBCL) and the Conners Rating Scale (CRS). Teachers filled in the Teacher Report Form (TRF), and the CRS. Boys and girls with ADHD had similar levels of psychiatric illness and school impairment (such as being held back, special class placement and learning problems) by mother report. Mothers reported similar levels of aggression and attention problems in boys and girls with ADHD. In contrast, teachers consistently rated boys with ADHD as having higher scores on reports of attention problems and aggression than girls with ADHD. Gender differences vary across settings: boys and girls with ADHD are rated as behaving differently at school, but not at home. The higher level of teacher reported problem behavior at school may explain the high male-female ratio for ADHD in clinical settings. These findings have implications for the results of genetic studies that rely on referred samples, as these studies may give a distorted view of sex differences in the population.",

Each is subject to genetic influences, but little is known about changes in genetic and environmental influences on these traits over time. We investigated the contribution of genetic and environmental influences to variation in these biochemical traits in adolescent twins and their nontwin siblings from 965 twin families. Twins were studied at ages 12, 14 and 16 years. Multivariate genetic models that included effects of age and sex were fitted to determine whether the same or different genetic or environmental factors influence each trait at different ages. Results showed that the genetic factors influencing AST, ALT, GGT and uric acid change over time during adolescence, and that the magnitude of these effects differs between males and females. The nonshared environment effects were generally time specific. There are developmental changes in genes affecting these traits during adolescence.",

A reanalysis of the Finnish Twin Cohort 1975 questionnaire data (included in Tisher and Carey) indicates that when intrapair correlations are correctly taken into account, the MZ-DZ difference in that study is no longer statistically significant.

We evaluated the genetic and environmental relationships of these measures over time in an analysis of twin pairs. Monozygotic (235 pairs) and dizygotic (260 pairs) male twins were participants in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Veteran Twin Study, and were followed with three clinical exams from mean age 48 years to mean age 63 years. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with adjustment for APOE genotype (a significant contributor to TC and LDL-C) was used to assess longitudinal patterns of heritability. Results indicated a contribution of genetic factors to BMI, TC, LDL-C, HLD-C, and TG. Modest increases over time were observed in the heritability of BMI (from 0.48 to 0.61), TC (from 0.46 to 0.57), LDL-C (from 0.49 to 0.64), and HDL-C (from 0.50 to 0.62), but this trend was not present for TG. There was a corresponding decrease in shared environmental influences over time for these traits, although shared environment was a significant contributor only for HDL-C. Moreover, we observed that genetic influences for all measures were significantly correlated over time, and we found no evidence of age-specific genetic effects. In summary, longitudinal analyses of twin data indicate that genetic factors do not account for a significant proportion of the variation in age-related changes of BMI or lipid and lipoprotein levels.",

    "abstract": "The modifying effects of psychiatric and familial risk factors on age at smoking initiation, rate of progression from first cigarette to regular smoking, and transition time from regular smoking to nicotine dependence (ND) were examined in 1269 offspring of male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Mean age of the sample was 20.1 years. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses adjusting for paternal alcohol dependence and ND status and maternal ND were conducted. Both early age at first cigarette and rapid transition from initiation to regular smoking were associated with externalizing disorders, alcohol consumption, and cannabis use. Rapid escalation from regular smoking to ND was also predicted by externalizing disorders, but in contrast to earlier transitions, revealed a strong association with internalizing disorders and no significant relationship with use of other substances. Findings characterize a rarely examined aspect of the course of ND development and highlight critical distinctions in risk profiles across stages of tobacco involvement.",

    "abstract": "Birthweight discordance amongst twins is associated with an increase in perinatal morbidity and mortality. Clinical decisions regarding the management of twins are often made on the basis of estimated fetal weight in the third trimester. This study assesses the efficacy of routine third trimester ultrasound fetal biometry, third trimester fetal growth velocity and first trimester differences in size in the prediction of subsequent birthweight discordance.\nStructurally and chromosomally normal dichorionic twin gestations resulting in two live births after 24 weeks gestation were identified. Ultrasound examinations of dichorionic twin pregnancies between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation were evaluated for inter-twin biometric disparity in crown-rump length (CRL). Estimated fetal weight (EFW) was calculated from the last scan before delivery. Fetal growth velocity (FGV) was calculated from two estimates of fetal weight between 21 and 35 days apart and incorporating the last EFW before delivery. EFW and FGV were expressed as standard deviation scores (Z scores). Disparity between these ultrasound parameters was correlated to inter-twin birthweight difference. Birthweight discordance was defined as > or =20% difference in birthweight relative to the heavier twin. Fishers exact and Spearman rho tests were used for statistical analysis. Test performance is expressed as area under the ROC curve and likelihood ratios (LR).\nOne hundred and thirty-five dichorionic gestations were identified over a consecutive 3-year-period. One hundred and eight twin gestations had both crown-rump length (CRL) and sufficient ultrasound measurements in the third trimester to calculate FGV. Twenty-six pregnancies (24%) had discordant birthweight. Only EFW Z score difference was correlated with birthweight disparity (r=0.36, p = <0.001). An EFW Z score difference of 0.6 had an area under the ROC curve of 0.70 (95% C.I. 0.59-0.79) but this did not differ significantly from first trimester prediction of growth discordance which had an area of 0.55 (95% C.I. 0.44-0.66). The LR for first and third trimester prediction of discordance were low.\nUltrasound measurement of fetal growth velocity and size both in the first and third trimesters is a poor predictor of birthweight discordance. Disparate fetal growth is exhibited as early as 10-14 weeks gestation and differences at this early stage in fetal development are no less accurate than EFW within 1 month of delivery. First trimester ultrasound, third trimester growth velocity and third trimester EFW do not accurately predict the delivery of twins with discordant birthweight.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of genetic factors to individual differences in food use was estimated in a large population-based twin cohort of young adults (22- to 27-year-old). Male and female twins (n=2009 complete twin pairs) evaluated use-frequencies of 24 food items using 5 categories (1=never-5=several times a day) in a postal questionnaire. Foods were categorized by factor analysis. Estimates of the relative proportions of additive genetic, shared environmental, and unshared environmental effects on the use-frequency of food items and factor scores were obtained by quantitative genetic modeling of twin data based on linear structural equations. Four factors of food use were identified: \"healthy\" foods, high-fat foods, sweet foods, and meats. The variance of the use-frequency of food items and food categories was explained by additive genetic and unshared environmental influences, whereas shared environmental factors did not contribute to food use. The average proportions of genetic effects on the total variance of the use-frequency of food items and food categories were 40% and 45%, respectively. Sex differences were observed in the magnitude of genetic influences for use-frequency of four food items (chocolate, other sweets, fried foods, and meat), and in genetic factors underlying the use of three (fresh vegetables, fruits, and cheeses) items. In conclusion, family environment does not appear to influence the food use of young adults and thus nutritional education should be targeted at this age group to support development of healthy eating patterns. In addition, the results illuminate the importance of the sex-specific genetic effects on food use.",

    "abstract": "Genes that influence a phenotype earlier in life may differ from those influencing the same phenotype later, particularly during significant development periods such as puberty, when it is known that new genetic and environmental influences may become important. In the present study, body mass index (BMI) data were collected from 470 monozygotic twin pairs and 673 dizygotic twin pairs longitudinally at ages 12, 14 and 16, roughly straddling puberty. In order to examine whether there are qualitative and quantitative differences in genetic and environmental influences affecting BMI in males and females, during development, a general sex-limitation simplex model (which represents the longitudinal time series of the data) was fitted to the repeated measurements of BMI. The ADE simplex model provided the best fit to the adolescent data, with disparity in the magnitude of additive genetic influences between sexes, but no differences in the non-additive genetic (epistasis or dominance) or environmental influences. Results found may reflect many genetic and environmental influences during puberty, including the possible complex interaction between genes involved in the biological mechanism of weight regulation and the development of likely peer pressured activities such as severe exercise and diet regimes. Although, over 1,000 pairs of twins were used, this study still lacked the power to properly discriminate between additive and non-additive genetic variance.",

    "abstract": "The relative importance of determinants in bone mineral density (BMD) in adult men is partly unclear. Our goals were to investigate the effects of familial aggregation and behavioral factors on the change in BMD during a 5-yr follow-up. Subjects (n=140) were 70 exposure-discordant monozygotic twin pairs (age 35-69 yr). BMD was measured with the same dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner at baseline and at the 5-yr follow-up. A variety of covariates were used including physical examination and interview data. Multivariate linear regression was used. The mean annual decrease in femoral BMD was 0.2%. The mean lumbar BMD was unchanged, although 8-17% of subjects had a decrease of more than 5%. Familial aggregation explained 14% of the changes in femoral BMD and 19% in lumbar BMD. The stability of BMD in the follow-up was high, both for individuals (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.90-0.94) and for co-twins in a pair (ICC=0.77-0.84). In femoral BMD, use of alcohol (p=0.006), coffee (p=0.046), and beta-blockers (p=0.043) led to increases, whereas smoking led to a decrease (p<0.01). We concluded that frequent increases in BMD, influenced by beta-blockers, partly explain the minor mean changes during follow-up; however, about every 10th subject had a significant decrease. Overall, familial effects played a dominant role in BMD changes in adult men.",

    "abstract": "A number of different theoretical approaches to understanding the etiology of ejaculatory dysfunction have been proposed, but no behavior genetic study has yet, to our knowledge, been conducted to explore the genetic and environmental influences on ejaculatory dysfunction.\nThe aim of the present study was to explore the genetic and environmental effects on premature (PE) and delayed (DE) ejaculation in a population-based sample.\nThe genetic and environmental influences on PE and DE were investigated in a population-based sample of 1,196 Finnish male twins, age 33-43 years, with 91 identical and 110 complete twin pairs. Several different aspects of ejaculatory function were measured by a self-report questionnaire (e.g., latency time, subjective experience of ejaculatory control). Factor analyses distinguished two subcomponents of ejaculatory function, and subsequently, composite variables measuring PE and DE were created. Structural equation modeling was performed on the composite variables.\nMeasurement of genetic and environmental effects on PE and DE.\nThe results suggested moderate genetic influence (28%) on PE, but not on DE (0%). There was a moderate familial effect on DE with shared environmental effects accounting for 24% of the variance. However, omission of the shared environmental component did not directly result in a significantly decreased model fit for DE, and omission of the additive genetic component did not directly result in a significantly decreased fit for the PE model.\nThe findings from the present study provide useful information regarding the etiology and understanding of ejaculatory dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Genetics and environment both play a role in weight maintenance. Twin studies may help clarify the influence of nature vs nurture in weight loss. We present the largest U.S. experience with monozygotic (MZ) twins undergoing bariatric surgery.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the charts of four sets of MZ twins who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) surgery and laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) placement at three different institutions. BMI and co-morbidities were examined pre- and postoperatively, and laboratory values were recorded.\nAll four sets of twins are female, live together, and have similar professions. Twin cohort 1 had near identical weight loss patterns after open RYGBP surgery in 1996 (preop 146/142 kg; 2 years 82/82; and 10 years 108/107). Twin cohort 1 also both underwent cholecystectomies within the first year postoperatively. Twin cohort 2 underwent laparoscopic RYGBP surgery and also required cholecystectomies in the first postoperative year. Cohort 2 also experienced nearly identical weight loss at 1 year (36.7% vs 37.0% BMI loss). Twin cohort 3 underwent LAGB placement with two different surgeons with differing amounts of weight loss at 6 months (6.5% vs 15.7% BMI loss). Finally, twin cohort 4 underwent laparoscopic RYGBP with 2-year BMI loss of 39% vs 34%. In twin cohort 4, the twin who lost less weight lived apart from her twin and extended family, and her weight loss was less than the twin living with her family.\nTwo sets of MZ twins had identical responses to bariatric surgery. The other two sets of identical twins had differential weight loss results, possibly due to differences in surgical approach and social support. While genetics do exert a strong influence on weight loss and maintenance, this case series demonstrates the potential effect of social support and postoperative management upon postoperative weight loss in the presence of identical genetics.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors regulating the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism in a complex and to some extent unknown manner. Our aim was to study the impact of different factors on PPARdelta mRNA expression in human skeletal muscle on one side, and the impact of PPARdelta mRNA expression on these factors, including glucose and lipid metabolism, aerobic capacity, fibre type composition and lipid profile, on the other side. PPARdelta mRNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR in muscle biopsies from 176 young and elderly monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Young twins had significantly increased PPARdelta mRNA levels compared with elderly twins. A 2 h hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp had no significant effect on PPARdelta mRNA levels. Biometric models were calculated for basal PPARdelta mRNA expression to estimate the degree of genetic versus environmental influence. In both young and elderly twins there was a substantial genetic component influencing basal PPARdelta mRNA levels. In a regression model, the muscle PPARdelta mRNA expression was correlated to birth weight, central adiposity and age. The level of PPARdelta mRNA was also positively correlated with markers for oxidative muscle fibres. However, in this apparently healthy study population, we found no correlations between PPARdelta mRNA expression and aerobic capacity, lipid profile or glucose and lipid metabolism. In conclusion, we provide evidence that mRNA expression of PPARdelta in human skeletal muscle is under genetic control but also influenced by factors such as age, birth weight and central adiposity.",

    "abstract": "Finland and Sweden are neighbouring countries with a substantially higher incidence and mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) in Finland. Migration from Finland to Sweden has resulted in a population of about 187,000 Finnish immigrants, with a higher risk of CHD than Swedes. The aim of the present study was to analyse the prevalence of CHD in migrants to Sweden compared with co-twins remaining in Finland.\nThe study population consisted of twin pairs of the Finnish Twin Cohort Study where at least one twin had lived one year or more in Sweden, including 1,534 subjects and 251 complete twin pairs discordant regarding residency in Sweden. Emigrant twins were compared with nonmigrant co-twins regarding prevalence of CHD in 1998. CHD prevalence was assessed by self-reported questionnaires validated using information from a clinical examination.\nSelf-reported CHD showed a good correspondence with clinical diagnosis. Differences in social and behavioural risk factors for CHD among men were small but emigrants were more physically active than non-migrants. Female emigrants had less overweight and better education, but were more often working class than non-migrants. Intra-pair comparisons restricted to migration discordant pairs showed a tendency towards a reduced prevalence of CHD in the migrant co-twins (0.6; 0.3-1.4). In analyses of all subjects disregarding pair status, emigrants showed a reduced prevalence of CHD compared with subjects always living in Finland (0.6; 0.4-0.9).\nEmigration from Finland to Sweden may be associated with a reduced prevalence of CHD. The causes are most likely multifactorial and may involve changes in dietary habits, physical activity, psychosocial factors, and inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The twin reverse arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence is a serious complication of monochorionic multiple pregnancies in which the affected twin is reversely perfused from the healthy co-twin, resulting in severely abnormal or absent cardiac development, severe malformations, and massive hydrops fetalis. The acardiac twin threatens the survival of the pump twin either by increasing the risk of congestive cardiac failure or by the development of polyhydramnios, preterm premature rupture of membranes, preterm labour and premature delivery. A wide spectrum of surgical interventions has been applied in the management of TRAP; however, because of the rarity of this condition and the heterogeneity of its presentation, no single technique has been shown to be unequivocally optimal. In our experience, fetoscopic laser coagulation of the placental vascular anastomoses or the umbilical cord of the acardiac twin, with the possibility of applying bipolar forceps as an additional minimally invasive surgical technique, offers an effective treatment option in the management of the TRAP sequence; this treatment has a survival rate of 80%, and 67% of pregnancies with surviving pump twins go beyond 36 weeks of gestation without further complications.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a common disabling condition, with known environmental and familial risk factors and with their assumed interactions. We wanted to carry out a family study on asthma to address gene-environment interactions at a population level.\nWe conducted a nation-wide study on familial risks for asthma. An asthma database was constructed by linking the Multigeneration Register on 0-72-year-old subjects to the Hospital Discharge Register for diagnosed asthma cases in Sweden from years 1987 to 2004. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for affected singleton siblings, twins and spouses by comparing with those whose siblings or spouses had no asthma.\nA total of 67 370 hospitalized cases and 5638 affected siblings were identified with a familial SIR of 3.70, which was independent of sex, diagnostic age and age differences between the siblings. The SIR for different-sex twins was 5.17 and for same-sex twins it was 13.38. There was a low correlation between spouses for asthma.\nAsthma shows a higher familial risk than many common diseases. The higher difference in familial excess risk between singleton siblings and different-sex twins provides strong genetic epidemiological evidence for gene-environment interactions in asthma. The concept of gene-environment interactions needs to be accommodated in future aetiological studies on asthma. Data on environmental factors and family history are important for clinical risk estimation.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common congenital disorder at birth. Yagel and colleagues's method of heart examination has been proved valuable in finding CHD prenatally in single pregnancies. The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency of CHD in twin pregnancies and the sensitivity of the method.\nA total of 1103 pregnant women with twins were enrolled in this study, including 127 cases with high-risk for CHD. Five transverse ultrasound measurements were used for fetal heart examination, including the upper abdomen view, four-chamber view, five-chamber view, pulmonary artery bifurcation view, and three-vessel view. In the fetuses who were diagnosed with CHD and whose parents requested termination of the pregnancy, autopsy of the fetal heart was performed after an abortion, and a blood sample was collected from the heart for chromosome evaluation. In the other fetuses, a close follow-up was conducted by echocardiography within one year after birth.\nAntenatally, CHD was found in 12 twins, of which 4 were from the high-risk group (3.15%), and 8 from the low-risk group (0.82%). In 2 pairs of the twins, the two fetuses had a same kind of CHD (one pair had tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), another pair had rhabdomyoma). Another pair had different types of anomaly (one fetus had TOF, and the other duodenal atresia with a normal heart). Termination of pregnancy was performed in these three pairs and the autopsy of the fetal heart confirmed the ultrasound findings. In the other 9 pairs, CHD was detected in one fetus, and a normal heart in the others. In the cases who received chromosome evaluation, 2 had abnormal chromosomes. During the follow-up after birth, heart examinations confirmed the prenatal diagnosis in 7 of the 9. The diagnosis of CHD was missed antenatally in 2 pairs of twins. In both the cases, one fetus was normal, and the other was confirmed as having CHD after birth (small ventricle septum defect in one, and persistent open ductus arteriosus in the other). Thus, the total frequency of CHD was 16 (7.3/1000), which was similar to that in single pregnancies. The sensitivity of fetal echocardiography was 87.5% and the specificity was 100%.\nThe frequency of CHD is the same in twin as in single pregnancies. Systemic ultrasound scanning with five transverse views is effective in diagnosing fetal CHD in twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "In his 1978 article on tuberculosis (TB) in twins, Comstock concluded that the 2.5-fold higher concordance rate for TB among monozygotic versus dizygotic twins in the Prophit survey of the 1950s implicated inherited susceptibility as a major risk factor for TB in humans. His analysis did not take into account strong imbalance of variables within subgroups, underestimating possible confounding effects of environmental factors.\nTo reconsider the role of environmental versus hereditary factors in determining the concordance rate of TB among twin pairs.\nReanalysis of the Prophit Survey.\nA known Mycobacterium tuberculosis-positive or M. tuberculosis-negative sputum in the index TB case markedly influenced the odds ratio (OR) of concordance in the twin pairs. In 87 pairs with co-twins exposed to a sputum-negative index case, monozygotic and dizygotic twins did not differ in concordance for TB (OR, 1.1; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.4-2.8). A higher concordance rate for TB among monozygotic versus dizygotic twins was confined to 106 pairs with the co-twins exposed to a sputum-positive index case (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.6-7.2), and was highest in adolescent twins living together. ORs of TB concordance were proportional to intensity of exposure (sputum smear positivity, physical proximity between twin pairs, contagiousness of disease, and living together) rather than to zygosity.\nIn the Prophit survey of susceptibility to TB among twins, environmental factors (i.e., intensity of exposure to tubercle bacilli) outweigh the importance of hereditary factors. Environmental factors and the context of transmission should be given more emphasis when studying interindividual and population differences in susceptibility to infectious diseases such as TB.",

Previous data suggest that initial HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses are determined largely by viral and host genetics, but the mechanisms influencing the subsequent viral evolution are unclear. Here, we show a random recruitment of T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta clonotypes of the initial HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells during primary infection in two genetically identical twins infected simultaneously with the same virus, suggesting that stochastic TCR recruitment of HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells contributes to the diverse and unpredictable HIV-1 sequence evolution.",

    "abstract": "Preterm male infants are at a disadvantage when compared with female infants regarding the incidence of respiratory and neurologic morbidity and mortality. At term, female infants from unlike-sex twin pairs have birth weights that are closer to their male co-twins than to girls from like-sex twin pairs. We hypothesized that if the male disadvantage is mediated via factors that affect fetal lung development, there may be a potential effect on the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and its complications in female infants from unlike-sex pairs.\nIn this population-based study we used data from the Israel Neonatal Network, which included data from 8858 very low birth weight (500-1500 g) infants of 24 to 34 weeks' gestation. The incidence of morbidity and mortality was compared in male and female infants from singletons and like-sex and unlike-sex twin pairs. Multivariable analyses were used, accounting for relevant confounding variables.\nMale singletons and like-sex twins were at increased risk for mortality, respiratory distress syndrome, pneumothorax, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia. However, in unlike-sex twin pairs, no difference was seen in the incidence of respiratory morbidity between male and female twins. The male disadvantage was maintained for mortality and periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage.\nThese findings suggest that the difference in morbidity and mortality between male and female premature infants represents a male disadvantage as opposed to a female advantage and that this disadvantage may be transferred from boys to girls in unlike-sex twin pairs, perhaps via an intrauterine paracrine effect.",

    "abstract": "Exercise capacity is reduced after both short- and long-duration exposures to microgravity. Previously, we have documented that supine treadmill exercise within lower-body negative pressure (LBNP(ex)) maintains upright exercise responses in men after 5 and 15 d of bed rest, as a simulation of microgravity.\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether LBNP(ex) would protect against loss of upright exercise capacity (VO2peak) and sprint performance during a longer-duration bed rest.\nEight sets of male twins participated in 30 d of bed rest. Within each twin pair, one was randomly assigned to a control group (CON) who performed no exercise, and the other was assigned to an exercise group (EX) that performed a 40-min interval (40-80% pre-bed rest VO2peak) LBNP(ex) (55 +/- 4 mm Hg) protocol, plus 5 min of resting LBNP, 6 d.wk(-1). LBNP produced footward force equivalent to 1.0-1.2 body weight. Before and after bed rest, subjects completed an upright graded exercise test to volitional fatigue and a sprint test of 30.5 m.\nAfter bed rest, VO2peak was decreased significantly in the CON subjects (-23 +/- 4%, P < 0.01) but was maintained in the EX subjects (-3 +/- 3%). Sprint time was increased in the CON subjects (24 +/- 8%, P < 0.05) but was maintained in the EX group (8 +/- 2%).\nThis exercise countermeasure protocol may help prevent microgravity-induced deconditioning during long-duration space flight.",

    "abstract": "Adjuvant chemotherapy has been associated with mild cognitive decline among a subset of breast cancer survivors. Late cognitive effects after chemotherapy can have a deleterious impact on survivor quality of life and functional health; however, the etiology of chemotherapy-related cognitive dysfunction remains unknown.\nWe present a case of monozygotic twins who are discordant for breast cancer and chemotherapy exposure (ie, one twin contracted breast cancer and underwent chemotherapy, and the other had no breast cancer). As part of a larger study, each was evaluated with standardized, self-report measures of cognitive function, standard neuropsychological tests, and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nResults indicated small differences in neuropsychological test performance but striking contrasts in self-reported cognitive complaints and structural and functional MRI images. Specifically, the twin who underwent chemotherapy had substantially more subjective cognitive complaints, more white matter hyperintensities on MRI, and an expanded spatial extent of brain activation during working memory processing than her nonaffected twin.\nThis case illustrates possible physiologic mechanisms that could produce long-term cognitive complaints among chemotherapy recipients and help formulate hypotheses for further empirical study in the area of chemotherapy-associated cognitive dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) occurs in approximately 3-10% of singleton pregnancies, in 9.1% of all twins, and in 9.9% of monochorionic twins. Spontaneous demise of the IUGR twin may occur and may result in concomitant demise or severe neurological handicap of the other twin. Currently, monochorionic twins with selective IUGR (SIUGR) are managed expectantly. Alternatively, all adverse consequences resulting from the potential demise of the SIUGR twin could be averted by unlinking the circulations between the two fetuses. The latter can be achieved by laser photocoagulation of communicating vessels or by umbilical-cord occlusion. The purpose of this chapter is to review this important entity in obstetrics.",

The survivor cohort was subdivided according to gestational age at the time of vanishing to give groups of early (<8 weeks), intermediate (8-22 weeks) and late (>22 weeks) survivors.\nThe rate of SGA infants was significantly higher in survivors than in singletons (OR: 1.50, 95%CI: 1.03-2.20) and a significant inverse correlation was observed between SGA and the gestational age at the time of vanishing (r = -0.10, P < 0.02). Also in term infants, the risk of birthweight <2500 g was higher in survivors than in singletons (OR: 1.71, 95%CI: 1.06-2.74).

    "abstract": "Although over 50 twin and adoption studies have been performed on the genetic architecture of antisocial behaviour, far fewer studies have investigated prosocial behaviour, and none have done so on a non-western population. The present study examined mothers' ratings of prosocial behaviour in 514 pairs of 2- to 9-year-old South Korean monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Correlational analyses showed a tendency of increasing genetic effects and decreasing shared environmental effects with age although shared family environment effects and the moderating effects of age did not attain statistical significance in model-fitting analyses. The best-fitting model indicated that 55% (95% CI: 45-64%) of the variance in the 2- to 9-year-olds' prosocial behaviour was due to genetic factors and 45% (95% CI: 36-55%) was due to non-shared environmental factors. It is concluded that genetic and environmental influences on prosocial behaviour in young South Koreans are mostly similar to those in western samples.",

    "abstract": "During aging, chromosome ends, or telomeres, gradually erode or shorten with each somatic cell division. Loss of telomere length homeostasis has been linked to age-related disease. Remarkably, specific environmental assaults, both physical and psychological, have been shown to correlate with shortened telomeres. However, the extent that genetic and/or environmental factors may influence telomere length during later stages of lifespan is not known. Telomere length was measured in 686 male US World War II and Korean War veteran monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins (including 181 MZ and 125 DZ complete pairs) with a mean age of 77.5 years (range 73-85 years). During the entire process of telomere length measurement, participant age and twin status were completely blinded. White blood cell mean telomere length shortened in this elderly population by 71 base pairs per year (P < 0.0001). We observed no evidence of heritable effects in this elderly population on telomere length maintenance, but rather find that telomere length was largely associated with shared environmental factors (P < 0.0001). Additionally, we found that individuals with hypertension and cardiovascular disease had significantly shorter telomeres (P = 0.0025 and 0.002, respectively). Our results emphasize that shared environmental factors can have a primary impact on telomere length maintenance in elderly humans.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to analyse differences in cord characteristics between naturally conceived twins and twins born after assisted reproduction.\nBetween 1985 and 2004, the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey (EFPTS) registered 4159 twin pairs. We compared cord characteristics between 2119 naturally conceived dizygotic (DZ) twin members and 2243 DZ twin members originating from assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Data were adjusted for intra-twin correlation, year of birth, maternal age, gestational age, parity, sex of the child and number of placentas.\nMarginal cord insertion, velamentous cord insertion and single umbilical artery (SUA) occur more frequently in twins following infertility treatment (P < 0.001). The incidence of velamentous cord insertion increases proportionate with 'invasiveness' of reproductive techniques: 3.6% in naturally conceived twins versus 5% in twins after artificial induction of ovulation (AIO) [odds ratio (OR) 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-2.11], 7.4% in twins after IVF (OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.26-1.77) and 10.4% in twins after ICSI (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.14-1.51). SUA has the highest incidence in twins after AIO: 1.9% compared with 0.6% in naturally conceived twins (OR 3.19; 95% CI 1.66-6.11).\nUmbilical cords of twins born after ART have more pathologic characteristics when compared with cords of naturally conceived twins.",

    "abstract": "To what extent do genetic and environmental influences on reading disability overlap with those on mathematics disability? Multivariate genetic research on the normal range of variation in unselected samples has led to a Generalist Genes Hypothesis which posits that the same genes largely affect individual differences in these abilities in the normal range. However, little is known about the etiology of co-morbidity for the disability extremes of reading and mathematics.\nFrom 2596 pairs of 10-year-old monozygotic and dizygotic twins assessed on a web-based battery of reading and mathematics tests, we selected the lowest 15% on reading and on mathematics. We conducted bivariate DeFries-Fulker (DF) extremes analyses to assess overlap and specificity of genetic and environmental influences on reading and mathematics disability defined by a 15% cut-off.\nBoth reading and mathematics disability are moderately heritable (47% and 43%, respectively) and show only modest shared environmental influence (16% and 20%). There is substantial phenotypic co-morbidity between reading and mathematics disability. Bivariate DF extremes analyses yielded a genetic correlation of .67 between reading disability and mathematics disability, suggesting that they are affected largely by the same genetic factors. The shared environmental correlation is .96 and the non-shared environmental correlation is .08.\nIn line with the Generalist Genes Hypothesis, the same set of generalist genes largely affects mathematical and reading disabilities. The dissociation between the disabilities occurs largely due to independent non-shared environmental influences.",

    "abstract": "Twins compared with singletons and monozygous (MZ) compared with dizygous (DZ) twins are at increased risk of fetal and infant death, cerebral palsy and many congenital anomalies. The aim of this study is to investigate whether zygosity is a risk factor for the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Birth registration data and draft infant death certificates for all multiple births in England and Wales 1993 to 2003 were provided by the Office for National Statistics. As a partial proxy for zygosity, same-sex was compared with opposite-sex twins for birthweight-specific mortality and mortality attributed to SIDS. Data on singleton infants were obtained by subtraction of multiple births from routinely published population births and infant deaths. SIDS mortality among low birthweight infants was significantly less in twins than singletons. The twin-singleton relative risk was reversed in infants of normal birthweight. Among infants of normal birthweight, neonatal SIDS was significantly more common in same- compared with opposite-sex pairs. Among infants of low birthweight, postneonatal SIDS was significantly more common in same- compared with opposite-sex pairs. The difference in birthweight distribution of same- compared with opposite-sex twins for neonatal SIDS suggests that zygosity is a risk factor for SIDS. As congenital cerebral anomalies are a feature of many monozygous twin conceptions, a detailed macro- and microscopical examination of the brain in twin SIDS may indicate an otherwise unrecognised pathology.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated a link between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental coordination disorder (DCD), and depression. The present study utilized a monozygotic (MZ) differences design to investigate differences in depressive symptomatology between MZ twins discordant for ADHD or DCD. This extends previous research as it controls for genetic effects and shared environmental influences and enables the investigation of nonshared environmental influences. In addition, children and adolescents with comorbid ADHD and DCD were compared on their level of depressive symptomatology to those with ADHD only, DCD only, and no ADHD or DCD. The parent-rated Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behavior, Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire, and Sad Affect Scale were used to assess ADHD, DCD, and depressive symptomatology respectively. The results revealed higher levels of depressive symptomatology in MZ twins with ADHD or DCD compared to their nonaffected co-twins. In addition, children and adolescents with comorbid ADHD and DCD demonstrated higher levels of depressive symptomatology compared to those with ADHD only, DCD only, and no ADHD or DCD. The implications of these findings are discussed with emphasis on understanding and recognizing the relationship between ADHD, DCD, and depression in the assessment and intervention for children and adolescents with these disorders.",

We find that classroom separation matters for language in Grade 2. Nonseparated twins score higher on language, and the difference is larger for same-sex pairs. This finding is robust for various methods that take unobserved effects into account. In addition, there is some evidence for higher scores in arithmetic in Grade 2. For the higher grades we find no effect of classroom separation on cognitive ability. In the analysis of the effect of a separation of at least 3 years we find that separation increases language performance between Grade 6 and 8 for opposite-sex pairs.",

    "abstract": "Interference processing requires increased focus on relevant dimensions of environmental stimuli and selective allocation of attentional resources, in order to filter extraneous information and inhibit non-adaptive responses. This process is important in everyday life and is necessary for responding to novel and challenging situations. Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is involved in this process, and behavioral twin studies indicate that performance on interference processing tasks is highly heritable. However, the extent to which dACC activation related to such tasks is influenced by genetic factors has not been reported. In the current study, 10 pairs of monozygotic and 10 pairs of dizygotic female twins performed a validated interference processing task during fMRI. There were three main results: (1) increased dACC activation for incongruent (INC) minus congruent (CON) trials was observed; (2) dACC activation for INC minus CON trials was both moderately heritable and significantly correlated with the difference in reaction time (RT) between INC and CON trials; (3) RT for INC trials was moderately heritable. RT for CON trials and the latency difference between INC and CON trials were not influenced significantly by genetic factors. The current study provides the first functional imaging evidence that dACC activation during interference processing is significantly influenced by genes. These results suggest an endophenotype that may be applied to various psychiatric disorders that are both highly heritable and associated with altered dACC function.",

    "abstract": "Increased neurotoxicity and poor long-term neurocognitive outcome of preschool children treated for brain tumors have led to innovative therapeutic strategies in order to delay or avoid the use of craniospinal radiation and to improve survival. Because these protocols are relatively new, few data exist regarding cognitive outcome. We conducted a twin case-control study to investigate neurocognitive and behavioral outcome in a preschool patient who was 16 months old at diagnosis of medulloblastoma and was treated with surgery, chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, and focal radiation to the tumor bed. Stability and change over two assessments were compared for the patient and her nonaffected twin for standardized measures of cognitive function and experimental measures of parent-child interaction, social competence, and goal-directed play. A striking finding was improvement in intelligence, receptive language, and visual-motor functioning in the affected twin from 12 months to 24 months after treatment. Improvement in ratings of parent-child interaction and social competence for the affected twin was also evident. These findings are notable compared with the potentially devastating impact of craniospinal tumor, and this study is among the first to document the relative benefit of focal radiation in sparing cognitive function, albeit in a single case study.",

    "abstract": "The amniotic band disruption complex (ABDC) has been attributed to vascular disruption by some authors, not by others. Acardiac twins (ATs), however, have been generally accepted as a prime example of vascular disruption. In this study a comparison was made of these two entities to determine if they were similar or not, and thus we attempted to resolve the controversy of the mechanisms in the ABDC. A female tendency (2:1) was found in the ABDC in contrast to the \"normal\" sex distribution (0.88:1) in the ATs (p < 0.001). Most types of malformations (66%) were mutually exclusive, notably those of the cranium/brain, abdominal wall, and most internal organs; 83% were more significantly related to one or other of the entities. The ABDC malformations tended to occur unilaterally, but in the ATs they occurred bilaterally (p < 0.0001); the former tended to involve external organs and the latter internal organs (p < 0.0001). With so many differences, the two entities are unlikely due to the same mechanism: the ABDC is more likely to be due to external disruption.",

    "abstract": "An adverse intrauterine environment indicated by both low birth weight and monozygosity is associated with an age- or time-dependent reduction in glucose disposal and nonoxidative glucose metabolism in twins, suggesting impaired regulation of muscle glycogen synthesis.\nWe measured the activities of glycogen synthase (GS), GS kinase (GSK)3 alpha, GS phosphorylation, and glycogen levels in muscle biopsies obtained from 184 young and elderly twins before and after a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp.\nElderly monozygotic twins had significantly lower fractional GS activity amidst higher glycogen and GS protein levels compared with dizygotic twins. In addition, we demonstrated strong nongenetic associations between birth weight and defect muscle glycogen metabolism in elderly--but not in younger--twins. Thus, for every 100 g increase in birth weight within pairs, GS fractional activity, GS protein level, and glycogen content was increased by 4.2, 8.7, and 4.5%, respectively, in elderly twins. Similarly, for every 100 g increase in birth weight, GSK3 alpha activity and GS phosphorylation at the sites 2, 2+2a, and 3a+3b were decreased by 3.1, 9.0, 10.1, and 9.5%, respectively.\nThe age- or time-dependent nongenetic impact of birth weight on insulin action in twins may partly be explained by reduced insulin activation of muscle GS, mediated through increased GSK3 alpha activity and GS phosphorylation. Reduced GS activity and negative feedback inhibition of glycogen metabolism by glycogen per se may contribute to the insulin resistance in elderly monozygotic compared with dizygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to provide a critical update of the impact of the 'thrifty phenotype hypothesis' on metabolism, and its implications for heritability estimates as obtained in so-called classical twin studies.\nOur recent studies demonstrated a complex age or time-dependent relationship between different and independent markers of an adverse intrauterine environment, including birth weight, twin and zygosity status on one side, and distinct defects of insulin secretion and glucose metabolism on the other side.\nThese novel findings may, to some unknown extent, influence and perhaps bias the heritability estimates of type 2 diabetes-related traits obtained using classical twin analyses. The studies add to the increasing evidence of the intrauterine environment as a - or the - key player in the cause and pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. We and others have shown that monozygotic twins represent a powerful tool to demonstrate nongenetic associations between low birth weight and different phenotypes of the metabolic syndrome, including type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and, recently, hypertension. Future studies of discordant monozygotic twins may provide novel and crucial mechanistic explanations of the link between low birth weight and the metabolic syndrome.",

We describe a pair of 1(1/2)-month-old dizygotic twins with laterally deviated nail plates of the great toenails since birth. By the time the infants were 10 months of age, significant realignment was observed. Adult pedigree members also showed slight similar deviations of the nail plates. We suggest that desynchronization of growth between the nail and the adherent end-phalanx of the hallux may result in temporarily larger nail plates, which are gliding outwards, in order to fit into the underlying bony space. During postnatal life, spontaneous realignment is usually observed, probably as a result of a faster growing end-phalanx.",

The cause is unknown.\nThe objective of the study was to study a pair of homozygotic twin boys, one of whom had severe KH from the age of 14 months, whereas the other boy was apparently healthy.\nAt the age of 6 yr, the boys were thoroughly investigated. During a 24-h fasting tolerance test, the twin with KH showed hypoglycemia (blood glucose 2.0 mmol/liter) after 18 h. Three h before the occurrence of hypoglycemia, he had had 10 times higher beta-hydroxybutyrate levels than his brother, who showed no signs of hypoglycemia. Their glucose production rates were normal and similar (23.3 and 21.7 micromol/kg body weight per minute in the healthy and KH twin, respectively) as well as their lipolysis rates (5.8 and 6.8 micromol/kg body weight per minute, respectively). During repeated 60-min infusions of beta-hydroxybutyrate, the plasma level of beta-hydroxybutyrate increased 5-10 times more in the twin with KH (mean 1.1 mmol/liter in the healthy and 10.8 mmol/liter in the KH twin), indicating a disturbed clearance or metabolism of beta-hydroxybutyrate. No mutations were found in genes involved in ketone body metabolism or transport.\nIn the affected boy, KH seems to be the result of a reduced capacity to use ketone bodies, leading to increased peripheral metabolism of glucose that cannot be met by hepatic glucose production. Because the boys are homozygotic twins and only one of them is affected, the ketotic hypoglycemia is most likely caused by an altered imprinting of gene(s) involved in regulating metabolic pathways.",

    "abstract": "In singleton gestations, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) has been shown to reduce the rate of recurrent preterm birth. This study was undertaken to evaluate whether 17P would reduce the rate of preterm birth in twin gestations.\nWe performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 14 centers. Healthy women with twin gestations were assigned to weekly intramuscular injections of 250 mg of 17P or matching placebo, starting at 16 to 20 weeks of gestation and ending at 35 weeks. The primary study outcome was delivery or fetal death before 35 weeks of gestation.\nSix hundred sixty-one women were randomly assigned to treatment. Baseline demographic data were similar in the two study groups. Six women were lost to follow-up; data from 655 were analyzed (325 in the 17P group and 330 in the placebo group). Delivery or fetal death before 35 weeks occurred in 41.5% of pregnancies in the 17P group and 37.3% of those in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 1.3). The rate of the prespecified composite outcome of serious adverse fetal or neonatal events was 20.2% in the 17P group and 18.0% in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.5). Side effects of the injections were frequent in both groups, occurring in 65.9% and 64.4% of subjects, respectively (P=0.69), but were generally mild and limited to the injection site.\nTreatment with 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate did not reduce the rate of preterm birth in women with twin gestations.

The extent to which the familial occurrence of coronary heart disease is due to genetic mechanisms can be assessed in twins. In our opinion, due to the chance of mortality risk in monozygotic twin being about 20 times higher than for a representative individual in the overall population, and 3.2- to six-fold higher than for the dizygotic twin of a patient with myocardial infarction, aggressive cardiac evaluation is essential for the asymptomatic twin especially if symptomatic pair's lesion is critical.

Demographic data, medical histories and the results of 24-h urine testing, with samples collected on self-selected diets, were reviewed and analysed.\nThe cystinuric twins had very similar cystine excretion rates, while stone activity was significantly more pronounced in one. Metabolic abnormalities were concordant in one set of twins with calcium oxalate stones, both being hypercalciuric and hyperuricosuric. However, metabolic abnormalities were discordant in the other pair, one twin with hypercalciuria and the other with hypocitraturia. Two of the three pairs had low urinary volume.\nThese results support previous observations that environmental, genetic and potentially, anatomical factors play roles in kidney-stone formation. Additional controlled studies of monozygotic stone-forming twins might help to define the interplay between environmental and genetic factors, and allow the identification of susceptibility genes involved in stone generation.",

We studied 11 people with schizophrenia and their co-twins without manifest disease, using stimulus-induced changes in the magnetoencephalographic approximately 20 Hz rhythm as an index of activation in the motor cortex part of the mirror neuron system. During action observation and execution, motor cortex reaction was weaker in those with schizophrenia than in their co-twins, suggesting a disease-related dysfunction of motor cognition.",

    "abstract": "Affiliation with substance using peers is one of the strongest predictors of adolescent alcohol use. This association is typically interpreted causally: peers who drink incite their friends to drink. This association may be complicated by uncontrolled genetic and environmental confounds because teens with familial predispositions for adolescent substance use may be more likely to select into social networks where drinking is common. We test this alternative hypothesis using a sample of 1,820 twin and sibling pairs, and their same-sex best friends, from three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Across all three waves, peer report of substance use did not influence adolescent alcohol use when genetic and shared environmental predispositions for drinking were considered. The association between alcohol use and peer behavior may be a spurious association attributable to a shared genetic liability to drink alcohol and associate with peers who drink alcohol.",

We present dizygotic twins, one having ambiguous genitalia due to 2-hydroxylase deficiency, and the other having normal male genitalia with 46,XX maleness. One of the twins was referred to the endocrinology unit at 2 days old because of ambiguous genitalia. The other twin with bilateral undescended testes located in the inguinal canal was diagnosed with 46,XX maleness. The karyotype was 46,XX. Molecular analysis revealed the presence of SRY in the latter twin without M\u00fcllerian structures. Association of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (46,XX 21-hydroxylase deficiency) and 46,XX maleness in twins has not been previously reported.",

    "abstract": "To address the role of childhood sun exposure on the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) after controlling for genetic susceptibility, we investigated the association between sun exposure and MS comparing disease-discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins.\nTwins with MS were sought by yearly newspaper advertisements throughout North America from 1980 to 1992. Diagnosis was verified by updated medical documentation through 2005. This analysis was restricted to 79 disease- and exposure-discordant monozygotic twin pairs who had ranked themselves before 1993 in relation to each of nine childhood sun exposure activities. A sun exposure index (SI) was defined as the sum of those exposures for which one twin ranked higher than his or her co-twin. The SI difference within each twin pair was calculated by subtracting the SI value of the affected twin from the SI value of the unaffected twin (range -9 to +9). The results were then analyzed using conditional logistic models.\nEach of the nine sun exposure-related activities during childhood seemed to convey a strong protection against MS within MZ twin pairs. Depending on the activity, the odds ratio (OR) ranged from 0.25 to 0.57. For example, the risk of subsequent MS was substantially lower (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.83) for the twin who spent more time suntanning in comparison with the co-twin. For each unit increase in SI, the relative risk of MS decreased by 25%.\nEarly sun avoidance seems to precede the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). This protective effect is independent of genetic susceptibility to MS.",

The contributions of genetic and environmental factors to individual differences in IOP were estimated by applying an independent pathway model to twin data.\nContribution of genetic and environmental effects to the variation in IOP among MZ and DZ twins.\nMean IOP of the study population was 14.1 mmHg (+/- standard deviation 3.1) with no differences observed neither between the MZ and the DZ individuals, nor between the left and the right eyes. The pair-wise correlations for IOP of the right eye were .61 in MZ and .25 in DZ and for the left eye .63 and .42. The phenotypic correlation between the left and the right eye IOP was high (r = 0.81), suggesting that they were indices of a single trait. Quantitative genetic modeling revealed that for both eyes 64% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53-71) of the variance in IOP was explained by additive genetic effects and 18% (95% CI, 11-27) by nonshared environmental factors in common. In addition, 18% (95% CI, 15-23) of the variance in IOP was explained by nonshared environmental factors specific to each eye.\nAdditive genetic influences explained most of the individual differences in IOP among older women not diagnosed as having glaucoma. Because elevated IOP is an important risk factor for glaucoma, genetic factors underlying IOP may have a significant role in determining the risk for glaucoma, a complex progressive disease leading to death of ganglion cells.",

    "abstract": "In animal models, STAT3 action in the hypothalamus and liver appears essential for normal body weight and glucose homeostasis in response to insulin. We hypothesized that variation in the STAT3 gene may be associated with body fat and/or insulin resistance in the general population. Five tagging SNPs spanning the STAT3 gene, rs8074524, rs2293152, rs2306580, rs6503695, and rs7211777 were genotyped in 2776 white female twins (mean age, 47.4+/-12.5 yrs) from the St Thomas' United Kingdom Adult Twin Registry (Twins UK). Minor allele frequencies were as follows: rs8074524 (0.19), rs2293152 (0.37), rs2306580 (0.06), rs6503695 (0.35), and rs7211777 (0.34). The minor allele of rs2293152 was associated with higher homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (p=0.013) in the full cohort and confirmed in sib-transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT): (p=0.015; n=60). However, there were no associations with fasting serum insulin or glucose or with obesity variables. Although defective STAT3 action results in obesity and insulin resistance in animal models, we failed to establish any indicative associations with common SNPs in this human study.",

    "abstract": "Klinefelter syndrome (KS; 47, XXY) is characterized by increased body height, hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism, and infertility. We describe a patient with a variant KS (47,X,i(Xq),Y) who has a twin brother with a 46,XY karyotype. Molecular studies showed that the twins were monozygotic. The presence of an isochromosome Xq in one of two monozygotic twins allows precise investigation of its phenotypic effect. The patient was somewhat shorter (3.5 cm) and had a smaller volume of the testes (8 vs. 18 ml) as compared to his twin brother. Furthermore he had increased gonadotrophin levels and an extreme oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT). These data support the view that genes on Xp cause increased body height and genes on Xq cause infertility in KS. To our knowledge this is the first report on a heterokaryotypic monozygotic twin with a variant KS.",

    "abstract": "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the best option for young patients with SAA. With genetically identical twin as an ideal donor, the majority of SAA patients require appropriate immunosuppression before and after stem cell transplantation to obtain long-term hematopoietic reconstitution. Alkylating agents, used during conditioning, are associated with short- and long-term toxic effects that lead to poor compliance of treatment and could compromise the quality of future life. Three SAA patients, transplanted from genetically identical twins without using alkylating agents during conditioning, showed rapid and sustained hematological reconstitution without any evidence of conditioning-related toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Mammographic density, the light/white radiographic appearance on a mammogram that represents connective and epithelial tissue, is a strong risk factor for breast cancer which seems to be highly heritable. Little is known about its genetic determinants.\nWe studied 457 women from 207 sisterhoods (104 monozygotic twins, 182 dizygotic twins, and 171 singletons). Percentage mammographic density (PMD) as well as dense area and nondense area were calculated using a computer-assisted method. We measured six single nucleotide polymorphisms from six candidate genes (COMT, HSD3B1, IGFBP3, HER2, XPD, and XRCC3). Associations between genotypes and mammographic measures were tested (a) cross-sectionally using a multivariate normal model fitted using FISHER that allowed separate correlations for monozygotic, dizygotic, and nontwin pairs and (b) within sister pairs using paired t tests.\nCross-sectionally, each additional copy of the HSD3B1 Asn(367)Thr variant allele was associated with lower PMD (-3.47% per allele; SE = 1.65; P = 0.035). Within-pair regression estimates confirmed this association. There was no evidence for an association between the mammographic density measures and any of the other variants studied.\nWe have replicated an association between a variant in the HSD3B1 gene and PMD, which suggests that HSD3B1 may be genetic determinant of mammographic density.",

TTTS was observed in one case associated with CHD; in this case the donor twin had a coarctation of the aorta. Abnormal cord insertion was observed in 9 (69%) out of the 13 affected infants, and a significant relation was found between the presence of CHD and abnormal cord insertion.\nOf the MC twins, the smaller seemed more likely to be affected by primary structural cardiac anomalies. CHD in MC twins is possibly related to an abnormal cord insertion. Further studies are warranted to determine whether a causal relationship exists.",

    "abstract": "Biological variables in height growth in Japanese singletons are well documented, but there has been less research on Japanese twins.\nThe study investigated the biological variables in height growth of Japanese twins and compared them with those of Japanese singletons.\nSamples of 92 boys and 99 girls from monozygotic twins, and 41 boys and 38 girls from dizygotic twins born in 1960-1973, from the Twin Class in the Junior and Senior High Schools affiliated to the University of Tokyo, Japan, were considered. The Bayes modal estimation method was applied to the triphasic generalized logistic growth model (BTT model). From the fitted model, the biological variables were extracted.\nThe monozygotic twins, on average, matured earlier than dizygotic twins, but later than singletons. Until pre-adolescence, the height velocity of twin children is lower than that of singleton children. This results in the final stature of twin youths being smaller than that of singleton youths. The twins are, on average, about 2.6 cm smaller than singletons in final height only due to the lower velocity during birth to pre-adolescence. Comparing with the average final stature of dizygotic children, the boys were 3.9 cm and the girls were 2.8 cm shorter than Japanese late-maturing boys and girls, respectively. For monozygotic children, the boys were 3.8 cm and the girls were 3.0 cm shorter than the respective Japanese late-matured singleton boys and girls.\nThe biological variables of twins differ significantly from those of singletons. It is important to recognize that singleton reference values do not correctly reflect the growth of twins.",

The twins are, on average, about 2.6 cm smaller than singletons in final height only due to the lower velocity during birth to pre-adolescence. Comparing with the average final stature of dizygotic children, the boys were 3.9 cm and the girls were 2.8 cm shorter than Japanese late-maturing boys and girls, respectively. For monozygotic children, the boys were 3.8 cm and the girls were 3.0 cm shorter than the respective Japanese late-matured singleton boys and girls.",

    "abstract": "The role of genetic factors in the development of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) has been well documented; however, reports of the specific mode of genetic inheritance are inconclusive. These facts, combined with the phenotypic variability of this disorder, suggest that the genetic expression of idiopathic scoliosis may be dependent on multiple factors and genetic interactions. However, it seems questionable whether there is evidence for a genetic aetiology for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, when in monozygotic twins there is no 100% concordance of the symptoms and prognosis.\nFive pairs of monozygotic tested twins with the diagnosis of AIS were presented in the outpatient practice of the author. There was no history of scoliosis in any other member of the family.\nPair 1: Growth is still left in both girls, however prognosis is totally different. The progression factor of the first girl was 1.75 and so she has a risk of >65% for curve progression, Cobb angle 40. Progression factor of the second girl was 0.56 and so she has a risk of <5% for curve progression, Cobb angle 18. Pair 2: Both girls presented with Risser 4. Cobb angle was 55 degrees in one of the twins (progression factor: 3.1; risk for progression >95%) and 220 in the other (progression factor: 0.7; risk for progression <5%). Curve pattern was thoracic in the first, double major in the second girl. Pair 3: Two monozygotic tested boys with similar bad prognoses and similar curve pattern and similar degrees of curvature (90 and 100 degrees). Pair 4: Two not tested girls with similar benign prognoses and similar curve patterns (18 and 22 degrees). Pair 5: Two monozygotic tested girls with different prognoses and similar curve patterns (26 and 49 degrees).\nDifferent curve patterns in two of the five pairs of twins as well as different prognoses can be discussed as phenotypic variability of AIS, however the findings from the other three pairs may be interpreted in the way that genetic factors play a role in the aetiology of AIS.",

    "abstract": "The familial nature of childhood conduct problems has been well documented, but few genetically informed studies have explicitly explored the processes through which parental conduct problems influence an offspring's behavior problems.\nTo delineate the genetic and environmental processes underlying the intergenerational transmission of childhood conduct problems.\nWe used hierarchical linear models to analyze data from a Children of Twins Study, a quasiexperimental design, to explore the extent to which genetic factors common to both generations, unmeasured environmental factors that are shared by twins, or measured characteristics of both parents confound the intergenerational association.\nParticipants were recruited from the community and completed a semistructured diagnostic telephone interview.\nThe research used a high-risk sample of twins, their spouses, and their young adult offspring (n = 2554) from 889 twin families in the Australian Twin Registry, but the analyses used sample weights to produce parameter estimates for the community-based volunteer sample of twins. Main Outcome Measure Number of conduct disorder symptoms.\nThe magnitude of the intergenerational transmission was significant for all offspring, though it was stronger for males (effect size [Cohen d] = 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.17) than females (d = 0.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.14). The use of the Children of Twins design and measured covariates indicated that the intergenerational transmission of conduct problems for male offspring was largely mediated by environmental variables specifically related to parental conduct disorder (d = 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.23). In contrast, the intergenerational transmission of conduct problems was not because of environmentally mediated causal processes for female offspring (d = - 0.09; 95% confidence interval, - 0.20 to 0.03); a common genetic liability accounted for the intergenerational relations.\nThe mechanisms underlying the intergenerational transmission of conduct problems depend on the sex of the offspring. The results are consistent with an environmentally mediated causal role of parental conduct problems on behavior problems in males. Common genetic risk, however, confounds the entire intergenerational transmission in female offspring.",

    "abstract": "Contrast sensitivity is strongly associated with daily functioning among older adults, but the genetic and environmental contributions to this ability are unknown. Using the classical twin method, we addressed this issue by examining contrast sensitivity at five spatial frequencies (1.5-18 cycles per degree) in 718 middle-aged male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA). Heritability estimates were modest (14-38%), whereas individual-specific environmental influences accounted for 62-86% of the variance. Identifying the types of individual-specific events that impact contrast sensitivity may suggest interventions to modulate this ability and thereby improve overall quality of life as adults age.",

    "abstract": "Using a unique twin approach, we examined the extent to which birth weight is determined by genetic and nongenetic factors and whether associations between birth weight and measures of glucose metabolism are of genetic or nongenetic origin.\nAn oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in a population-based cohort of twins including 138 same-sex monozygotic (MZ) and 214 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs aged 55-73 years whose birth weight was known. Heritability of birth weight was determined and regression analyses with intra-twin pair differences of birth weight and measures of glucose metabolism, with and without adjustment for adult obesity, were performed.\nThe heritability of birth weight was estimated to be 38%. We demonstrated significant nongenetic associations between birth weight and measures of glucose homeostasis in MZ twins, with a reduction in fasting plasma glucose, 120 min post-OGTT plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin and HOMA-IR index of 15.7%, 25.5%, 26.4% and 37.2%, respectively, for every 1 kg increase in birth weight. The nongenetic negative associations between birth weight and measures of glucose intolerance were independent of adult obesity, whereas the nongenetic association between birth weight and insulin resistance persisted, although not as strongly, after adjusting for current body size.\nWe demonstrated a genetic component to birth weight in elderly twins. When adjusting for this influence, we found a nongenetic negative association between birth weight and glucose tolerance as well as insulin resistance that was partially independent of adult obesity. This implies that the foetal environment influences glucose homeostasis in elderly twins.",

    "abstract": "A pair of thoracopagus conjoined twins were separated at the age of 3 months at Khon Kaen Regional Hospital, Thailand on November 19, 2004. Pre-operative investigations showed separate hearts, joined duodenum, and fusion of the livers. Separation of the extra-hepatic biliary systems was suspected. Operative findings revealed fusion of the intestines from the second part of the duodenum to the terminal ileum with two normal colons. An intussusception was found at the terminal ileum. Fusion of the livers with only one extra-hepatic biliary system was noted In one of the twins, the gastrointestinal tract was anastomosed with Roux-en- Y enteric loop to one area of good bile drainage at the cut surface of liver Post operative course was hectic but both twins recovered satisfactorily. Both are doing well at present, two years after the separation. This was the first reported case of thoracopagus conjoined twins with complex biliary tract anomalies in Thailand. From the literature, pre-operative investigations in most cases of these conjoined twins failed to define the precise anatomy of the biliary system and may be misleading as in the presented case. The mortality rate remains high. Meticulous pre-operative planning, decision-making in the operative field and postoperative management as well as a multidisciplinary team are very important for a successful separation.",

    "abstract": "Although parental divorce is associated with increased substance use and internalizing problems, experiencing the separation of one's parents may not cause these outcomes. The relations may be due to genetic or environmental selection factors, characteristics that lead to both marital separation and offspring functioning.\nWe used the Children of Twins (CoT) Design to explore whether unmeasured genetic or environmental factors related to the twin parent, and measured characteristics of both parents, account for the association between parental divorce and offspring substance use and internalizing problems.\nThe association between parental divorce and offspring substance use problems remained robust when controlling for genetic and environmental risk from the twin parent associated with parental divorce, and measured characteristics of both parents. The results do not prove, but are consistent with, a causal connection. In contrast, the analyses suggest that shared genetic liability in parents and their offspring accounts for the increased risk of internalizing problems in adult offspring from divorced families.\nThe study illustrates that unmeasured genetic and environmental selection factors must be considered when studying parental divorce. In explaining associations between parental divorce and young-adult adjustment, our evidence suggests that selection versus causal mechanisms may operate differently for substance abuse (a causal relation) and internalizing problems (an artifact of selection). The CoT design only controls for the genetic and environmental characteristics of one parent; thus, additional genetically informed analyses are needed.",

    "abstract": "The birth of conjoined twins occurs in approximately 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 deliveries, and the majority are either stillborn or die early in life. Approximately 184 successful separations have been described. The authors describe the preoperative radiologic evaluation of a set of thoracopagus-omphalopagus twins and their successful surgical separation. Preoperative radiologic imaging demonstrated that the twins did not share myocardium, but an ectopic cordis was present. The inferior vena cavae entered the right atria at more acute angles than normal. The liver was fused, two gallbladders were present, and there was a large bridging portal vein that crossed the hepatic isthmus of one twin to the conjoined twin's portal venous system. Replaced hepatic arteries originated from the superior mesenteric arteries. Each twin had separate kidneys, colons, and rectums. Preoperative tissue expansion was necessary, and the twins were separated at 5 1/2 months of life. Successful separation of twins conjoined by several organ systems requires a multispecialty approach. Preoperative knowledge of shared anatomy is necessary for adequate preparation and planning. Despite meticulous preoperative investigations, certain anatomy can only be discovered at the time of surgery, and the ability to adjust to these findings is imperative.",

    "abstract": "Despite the known influence of orthodontic treatment on facial appearance, there have been few comparative studies of the effect of different treatments, and none of these appear to have looked at the long-term consequences. This study compared the effect of traditional fixed appliances and orthotropic (growth guidance) treatment without fixed appliances on a series of 12 identical twins, 10 years after treatment. Facial changes were assessed by a panel of 12 lay judges. A comparison was also made of the dental changes and an error study undertaken. The results showed that most of the traditionally treated twins were judged to look less attractive after treatment, while most treated by orthotropics were judged to have improved. There was little difference in the dental results, but the traditionally treated cases seemed to relapse more frequently.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop a method to generate identical twins and triplets with predicted gender. As a first step toward that aim, single blastomeres obtained from EGFP expressing eight-cell stage embryos and either diploid or tetraploid host embryos were used to compose chimera. We could follow the fate of EGFP expressing diploid blastomere derived cells in 3.5- and 4.5-day-old chimera embryos in vitro. We found that the diploid blastomere-derived cells had significantly higher chance to contribute to the inner cell mass if tetraploid host embryos were applied. After that, we developed a quick and reliable multiplex PCR strategy for sex diagnosis from single blastomeres by simultaneous amplification of the homologous ZFX and ZFY genes. By composed chimeras using single blastomeres, derived from sexed eight-cell stage embryos and a tetraploid host embryo, we could get preplanned sex newborns, wholly derived from these blastomeres. Among these mice, identical twins and a triplet were identified by microsatellite analysis. Unlike clones produced by nuclear transfer, these mice are identical at both the nuclear as well as mitochondrial DNA level. Therefore, the tetraploid embryo complementation method to produce monozygotic twins and triplets could be a valuable tool both in biomedical and agricultural applications.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, including humans, female fetuses that are exposed to testosterone from adjacent male fetuses in utero can have masculinized anatomy and behavior. However, the reproductive consequences of such prebirth sex-ratio effects for offspring and their implications for maternal fitness remain unexplored. Here we investigate the effects of being gestated with a male co-twin for daughter lifetime reproductive success, and the fitness consequences for mothers of producing mixed-sex twins in preindustrial (1734-1888) Finns. We show that daughters born with a male co-twin have reduced lifetime reproductive success compared to those born with a female co-twin. This reduction arises because such daughters have decreased probabilities of marrying as well as reduced fecundity. Mothers who produce opposite-sex twins consequently have fewer grandchildren (and hence lower fitness) than mothers who produce same-sex twins. Our results are unlikely to be a consequence of females born with male co-twins receiving less nutrition because such females do not have reduced survival and increases in food availability fail to improve their reproductive success. Nor are our results explained by after-birth social factors (females growing up with similarly aged brothers) because females born with a male co-twin have reduced success even when their co-twin dies shortly after birth and are raised as singletons after birth. Our findings suggest that hormonal interactions between opposite-sex fetuses known to influence female morphology and behavior can also have negative effects on daughter fecundity and, hence, maternal fitness, and bear significant implications for adaptive sex allocation in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Proper functioning of the male reproductive axis depends on complex feedback systems between several hormones. In this study, the genetic contribution of various endocrine components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is evaluated and previously observed differences in FSH and inhibin B levels between mono- (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins are re-investigated.\nInhibin B, FSH, LH, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and testosterone levels were assayed in 128 adult males (20 MZ twin pairs, 7 single MZ twins, 10 DZ twin pairs, 27 single DZ twins and 34 siblings of twins, constituting 10 sibling pairs), aged 15.6-68.7 years. Hormone levels were compared across zygosity groups and heritability estimates were obtained using maximum likelihood variance component analysis.\nHeritability estimates ranged from 56% (testosterone) to 81% (inhibin B and SHBG). For LH and FSH, the heritability was estimated at 68% and 80% respectively. No mean differences in hormone levels were observed across groups.\nAll measured hormones are highly heritable. A difference in the FSH-inhibin B feedback system between DZ twin males and MZ twin males could not be confirmed.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune polyglandular syndromes (APS 1 and 2 types) are the primary defeat of the autoimmune process of two or more peripheral endocrine glands, usually leading to their functional failure and often combined with variousthe genogenic (Mendelian) nature of inheritance, when the autoimmune process in the endocrine and non-endocrine organs is caused by a mutation of a single AIRE gene (autoimmune regulator). Earlier, we published a case report of type 1 APS in a patient of 8 years old. Now she is 10 years. 1.5 years after the illness of this girl, a similar diagnosis was made to her twin sister. We believe that information about the characteristics of the disease in the twin sisters will make a certain contribution to the

    "abstract": "Surveys have shown opposition to human reproductive cloning (HRC) in many countries. Views of identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins are of particular interest, as they naturally share 100% of their genes. We investigated attitudes of British twins towards HRC in the context of assisted reproduction technologies (ART) and gene selection.\nAbout 4651 identical and non-identical (dizygotic, DZ) twins expressed their degree of agreement or disagreement to nine statements relating to ART, gene selection and HRC in a self-completion questionnaire.\nMost subjects (70% and 78% respectively) did not regard the use of medical technologies to treat infertility as interfering with either nature or God's will, despite believing that infertility is not a disease (54%). Attitudes to gene selection and HRC were context dependent, with more favourable views towards preventing serious diseases than towards enhancing traits. About 44% supported a permanent ban of HRC. MZ twins were significantly more likely to agree that HRC should be allowed for medical purposes, such as saving a sibling's life, than were DZ twins. Increasing religiosity generally correlated with more negative attitudes.\nMany attitudes are context dependent. More positive views of MZ twins towards HRC could be linked to their experience with being genetically identical.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed using population-based data to analyze whether motor development in early life is different between singletons and twins in Japan. For better comparison and investigation, we divided the 2 groups into a group with a birthweight of 2.5 kg or greater (subgroup A) and a group with a birthweight of less than 2.5 kg (subgroup B), respectively. We analyzed the database of medical check-ups for children aged 3 years between April 2001 and July 2004. They received medical checkups at 4 months, 1.5, and 3 years of age. Children who were suspected of having neurological abnormality or disability were referred to specialists and excluded from the database. The data of 14,132 children were analyzed. Among these, 13,040 (92.3%) children were singletons in subgroup A, 75 (0.5%) were twins in subgroup A, 866 (6.1%) were singletons in subgroup B and 151 (1.1%) were twins in subgroup B. The mean age at achieving milestones was slower in twins of subgroup A for each developmental outcome than singletons of subgroup A, and the difference between twins and singletons was significant after adjustment for rolling over. On the contrary, after adjusting for a confounding factor (gestational age), singletons of subgroup B attained motor development facilitating walking independently slower than twins of subgroup B. There were different tendencies in the results regarding the motor development of subjects of subgroup A and that of subjects of subgroup B.",

    "abstract": "While evidence supporting for nonadditive genetic influences on personality traits in Caucasian populations has been growing in recent years, twin studies that explored the existence of genetic nonadditivity in personality variation in Asian populations are still lacking. Seven hundred and sixty-five pairs of adolescent and young adult twins registered with the South Korean Twin Registry completed the 7 scales of the Eysenck Personality Scales through a mail survey. Maximum likelihood twin correlations were computed and model-fitting analyses were conducted. Monozygotic twin correlations were consistently higher than twice the dizygotic twin correlations for all 7 scales, suggesting pervasive influences of nonadditive genetic effects on personality traits in the South Korean population. Model-fitting analyses indicated that genetic nonadditivity is particularly important for the variation of Impulsivity, Venturesomeness, Empathy, Lie, and Psychoticism. According to the best fitting models, nonadditive genetic effects ranged from 34 to 49% for these scales. For Neuroticism and Extraversion, models that included an additive genetic component fit better than those including a nonadditive genetic variance component.",

    "abstract": "In previous studies we obtained evidence that variation in loneliness has a genetic component. Based on adult twin data, the heritability estimate for loneliness, which was assessed as an ordinal trait, was 48%. These analyses were done on loneliness scores averaged over items ('I feel lonely' and 'Nobody loves me') and over time points. In this article we present a longitudinal analysis of loneliness data assessed in 5 surveys (1991 through 2002) in Dutch twins (N = 8389) for the two separate items of the loneliness scale. From the longitudinal growth modeling it was found sufficient to have non-zero variance for the intercept only, while the other effects (linear, quadratic and cubic slope) had zero variance. For the item 'I feel lonely' we observed an increasing age trend up to age 30, followed by a decline to age 50. Heritability for individual differences in the intercept was estimated at 77%. For the item 'Nobody loves me' no significant trend over age was seen; the heritability of the intercept was estimated at 70%.",

    "abstract": "Although social and intellectual engagement have been consistently associated with late-life functioning, rather than true causation, these associations may reflect the experiential choices of high functioning individuals (i.e., selection effects). We investigated the association of social activity with late-life physical functioning, cognitive functioning, and depression symptomatology using data from 1112 pairs of like-sex twins who participated in the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins. Consistent with previous research, we found that social activity was significantly correlated with overall level of physical functioning, cognitive functioning, and depression symptomatology. We also found that social activity was significantly and moderately heritable (estimate of .36), raising the possibility that its association with late-life functioning might reflect selection processes. Further, social activity did not predict change in functioning and in monozygotic twin pairs discordant on level of social activity, the more socially active twin was not less susceptible to age decreases in physical and cognitive functioning and increases in depression symptomatology than the less socially active twin. These results are interpreted in the context of the additional finding that nonshared environmental factors, although apparently not social activity, are the predominant determinant of changes in late-life functioning.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to examine the neonatal outcome of second twins depending on presentation and mode of delivery. Using a database we analyzed the short-term neonatal outcome in twin pregnancies offered a trial of labor with special emphasis on the second twin depending on presentation and mode of delivery. Neonatal outcome was evaluated by Apgar scores, umbilical cord blood pH values, and perinatal or neonatal morbidity and mortality. Overall, in 219 (78%) of 281 pregnancies successful vaginal birth (VB) of both twins (VB-VB) was possible, 48 (17%) women had to be delivered by cesarean section (CS) of both twins (CS-CS), and in 14 (5%) women the second twin had to be delivered by CS after VB of the first twin (VB-CS). Successful VB was most common for vertex-vertex (V/V; n=171, 82%) and vertex-nonvertex (n=48, 75%) presentation (V/NV). Twins delivered by VB-CS had the lowest values for pHart (p=.006) and pHven (p=.010). pHart less than or equal to 7.00 values occurred only in second twins delivered VB-VB or VB-CS. Lower Apgar scores of the second twin occurred more frequently in the VB-CS and in the VB-VB than in the CS-CS groups (ps<.05). Lower levels of pHart (p=.002) and frequency of pHart less than or equal to 7.00 occurred more often in nonvertex second twins than in vertex second twins (p<.022). The high CS rate in V/NV presentation and the significantly worse perinatal short-term outcome of NV second twins after VB of the first twin underline that randomized studies are necessary to evaluate the best delivery mode for V/NV twins.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most frequent neurocutaneous disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. Phenotype variability is high ranging from merely several caf\u00e9-au-lait spots to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors or severe disfigurement through plexiform neurofibromas. Identification of genetic factors that modify the NF1 phenotype would contribute to the understanding of NF1 pathophysiology and improve patient counselling. As even monozygotic (MZ) twins with NF1 may differ phenotypically, we wondered whether these variations might be inherited in a non-Mendelian fashion. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited extrachromosomally through the cytoplasm of the oocyte and often harbours heteroplasmic sequence variations. At the time of blastomere separation, these variants may be skewedly distributed and effect phenotypic differences. Because of their co-localization with the tumor suppressor protein neurofibromin, which is mutated in NF1, mitochondria were particular attractive candidates for investigation. MtDNA was extracted from nucleated blood cells of four pairs of discordant MZ twins with NF1 and from cutaneous neurofibromas of one twin pair. We sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome and determined the state of heteroplasmy by investigating a microsatellite region of the mitochondrial D-loop (D310-tract). The clinical diagnosis was confirmed in all patients by detection of pathogenic mutations in the NF1 gene. Monozygosity was verified by genotyping. However, we did not detect evidence for mtDNA sequence differences or for different degrees of heteroplasmy between individuals of the same twin pair. The phenotypic discordance of MZ twins with NF1 cannot be explained by skewed distribution of mtDNA mutations or polymorphisms.",

    "abstract": "Girls who report first sexual intercourse during their early teen years have much higher rates of teenage pregnancy and childbearing than girls who delay sexual onset until older adolescence. In this study, we examine genetic and environmental influences on variation in teenage pregnancy and covariation with age at first sexual intercourse in two cohorts of Australian female twins. In the older twin cohort, born 1893-1964, we observe substantial heritable variation in teenage pregnancy that is largely shared with heritable variation in age at first sexual intercourse, with shared environment contributing little to variation in teenage pregnancy. Genetic influences on teenage pregnancy are smaller and nonsignificant in the younger twin cohort, born 1964-1971, where shared environment contributes much more and overlaps entirely with shared environmental variation in age at first intercourse.",

    "abstract": "Twin cohorts provide a unique advantage for investigations of the role of genetics and environment in the etiology of variation in common complex traits by reducing the variance due to environment, age, and cohort differences. The GenomEUtwin (http://www.genomeutwin.org) consortium consists of eight twin cohorts (Australian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Italian, Norwegian, Swedish, and United Kingdom) with the total resource of hundreds of thousands of twin pairs. We performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of one of the most heritable human complex traits, adult stature (body height) using genome-wide scans performed for 3,817 families (8,450 individuals) derived from twin cohorts from Australia, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Sweden, and United Kingdom with an approximate ten-centimorgan microsatellite marker map. The marker maps for different studies differed and they were combined and related to the sequence positions using software developed by us, which is publicly available (https://apps.bioinfo.helsinki.fi/software/cartographer.aspx). Variance component linkage analysis was performed with age, sex, and country of origin as covariates. The covariate adjusted heritability was 81% for stature in the pooled dataset. We found evidence for a major QTL for human stature on 8q21.3 (multipoint logarithm of the odds 3.28), and suggestive evidence for loci on Chromosomes X, 7, and 20. Some evidence of sex heterogeneity was found, however, no obvious female-specific QTLs emerged. Several cohorts contributed to the identified loci, suggesting an evolutionarily old genetic variant having effects on stature in European-based populations. To facilitate the genetic studies of stature we have also set up a website that lists all stature genome scans published and their most significant loci (http://www.genomeutwin.org/stature_gene_map.htm).",

    "abstract": "We present a 30-year-old woman with a twin pregnancy, 1 fetus displaying a small head circumference, semilobar holoprosencephaly, and cleft lip as detected by ultrasound at 23 weeks of gestation. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of semilobar holoprosencephaly. The other twin, however, had an appropriate fetal growth, devoid of any major structural anomalies. Karyotyping by G-banding of amniocentesis specimens in both fetuses showed 47,XY,+mar. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed in the marker chromosome positive dicentric signals for the chromosome 15 centromere-specific alpha satellite DNA probe (D15Z1) and negative signals for the SNRPN probe (15q11-13), thus establishing a cytogenetic diagnosis of 47,XX,+mar.ish idic(15)(q11-q13)(D15Z1++,SNRPN-) for both fetuses. The parental karyotypes were normal. The fetuses, therefore, had a de novo inv dup(15) marker chromosome without involvement of the Prader-Willi region. Short tandem repeat markers (total 15 markers) confirmed that the fetuses were monozygotic twins. Short tandem repeat markers at the 15q region (total 6 markers) excluded the possibility of uniparental disomy (15) mat or uniparental disomy (15) pat. Molecular study in both fetuses of TGIF, SHH, SIX3, and ZIC2 genes revealed a heterozygous 1085 C > T (Ser 362 Leu) on the SHH gene, but a homozygous 1085 C > C (Ser 362 Ser) for both parents on the SHH gene. The couple decided to terminate the pregnancy at 26 weeks of gestation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of semilobar holoprosencephaly with inv dup(15) marker chromosome and missense SHH gene mutation 1085 C > T (Ser 362 Leu).",

    "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has been associated with altered amounts of slow wave sleep, which could reflect reduced delta electroencephalograph (EEG) activity and impaired sleep regulation. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined the response to a sleep regulatory challenge in CFS.\nThe first of 3 consecutive nights of study served as laboratory adaptation. Baseline sleep was assessed on the second night. On the third night, bedtime was delayed by 4 hours, followed by recovery sleep. Total available sleep time was held constant on all nights.\nA research sleep laboratory.\n13 pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for CFS.\nN/A.\nPower spectral analysis quantified slow wave activity (SWA) in the 0.5-3.9 Hz band in successive NREM periods (stage 2, 3, or 4) on each night. To ensure comparability, analyses were restricted to the first 4 NREM periods on each night. Data were coded for NREM period and twin pair. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) contrasted sleep delay effects across NREM periods between twin pairs. A second ANOVA calculated the SWA in each NREM period in recovery sleep relative to baseline SWA. The 2 groups of twins were similar on baseline SWA power. After sleep delay, CFS twins exhibited significantly less SWA power in the first NREM period of recovery sleep and accumulated a smaller percentage of SWA in the first NREM period than their co-twins.\nCFS is associated with a blunted SWA response to sleep challenge, suggesting that the basic sleep drive and homeostatic response are impaired.",

    "abstract": "Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is caused by expansions of the poly (A) binding protein 2 (PABP2) gene. Previous histological analyses have revealed mitochondrial abnormalities in the muscles of OPMD patients but their significance remains uncertain.\nWe had the rare opportunity to study monozygotic twins with identical expansions of the PABP2 gene but with markedly different severities of OPMD. Both had histological features of mitochondrial myopathy. We determined whether mitochondrial DNA abnormalities underlay these changes.\nClinical information was obtained by history and examination. Muscle biopsies were obtained from each subject and genetic analysis was performed using long-range PCR and Southern blotting.\nWe demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions by Southern blotting in individuals with OPMD. This correlates with the presence of mitochondrial myopathy in both twins. Moreover, both twins had different mtDNA deletions, which might explain their phenotypic differences.\nWe hypothesise that mitochondrial dysfunction may occur as a consequence of PABP2 gene mutations, and that this dysfunction may affect the phenotypic manifestations of OPMD.",

    "abstract": "Genetic association studies are becoming commonplace due to the availability of cost-effective yet sophisticated DNA sequencing and genotyping resources and technologies. In addition, technologies designed to identify molecular and subclinical phenotypes that reflect disease pathogenesis are continually being developed and refined (consider, e.g., imaging technologies, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic platforms, histological analyses of excised tissues, etc.). Unfortunately, the large-scale use of many of these molecular and subclinical phenotyping technologies in genetic association studies is difficult logistically and is currently cost-prohibitive. In this paper, we consider efficient designs for testing the association between particular genetic variations and expensive, yet appropriate, subclinical phenotypes of relevance to a disease that take advantage of twins or sibling pairs discordant for genotypes at the locus (or loci) being tested. We demonstrate that including genotypically discordant twins or siblings in an association study can result in a substantial increase in power over designs that use monozygotic twins or only unrelated individuals. We ultimately argue that, from a practical standpoint, sampling from existing family or twin-based cohorts in which: (1) follow-up studies of a genetic association are warranted in order to assess the in vivo significance of an association with respect to more refined pathological phenotypes; and/or (2) large-scale, genome-wide linkage and association studies have been pursued that have focused on clinical endpoints for which the study subjects have consented to more elaborate follow-up studies, is a powerful way to test associations.",

    "abstract": "The significant worldwide health burden introduced by tobacco smoking highlights the importance of studying the genetic determinants of smoking behavior and the key factor sustaining compulsive smoking, that is, nicotine dependence (ND). We have here addressed the genetic background of smoking in a special study sample of twins, harmonized for early life events and specifically ascertained for smoking from the nationwide twin cohort of the genetically unique population of Finland. The twins and their families were carefully examined for extensive phenotype profiles and a genome-wide scan was performed to identify loci behind the smoking status, ND and the comorbid phenotype of ND and alcohol use in 505 individuals from 153 families. We replicated previous linkage findings on 10q (max logarithm of the odds (LOD) 3.12) for a smoker phenotype, and on 7q and 11p (max LOD 2.50, and 2.25, respectively) for the ND phenotype. The loci linked for ND also showed evidence for linkage for the comorbid phenotype. Our study provides confirmatory evidence for the involvement of these genome regions in the genetic etiology of smoking behavior and ND and for the first time associates drinking and smoking to a shared locus on 10q.",

    "abstract": "The heart rate response to nicotine may be an important component of the process leading to dependence. The present study is the first to determine the extent to which genetic and environmental sources play a role in various components of the heart rate response. One hundred and ten monozygotic and 29 dizygotic twin pairs received an i.v. infusion of nicotine and cotinine over 30 min. Before, during, and for 30 min after infusion, heart rate was measured via an electronic monitor. The clearance of nicotine was determined as a measure of the rate of nicotine metabolism. Average resting heart rate before infusion was 64.7 beats per minutes (bpm), and at the termination of infusion, heart rate had increased to an average of 72.7 bpm. At 30 min after infusion, heart rate had decreased to 67.5 bpm. Age, current smoking status, body mass index, and nicotine clearance were associated significantly with heart rate levels over the full 60 min of measurement. After adjustment for several covariates, including dose of administered nicotine and rate of nicotine clearance, the variance in several characteristics of the heart rate response curve was examined for the relative contribution from genetic and environmental sources. In the total sample, as much as 30.3% of the variance in the acceleration of heart rate was due to additive genetic sources. In nonsmokers, 34.8% and 31.0% of variance in the acceleration and deceleration of heart rate, respectively, was due to genetic sources. Heart rate acceleration and deceleration may be a reflection of central nervous system responsiveness to nicotine. The contribution from genetic sources to heart rate response characteristics should be investigated further as a potential endophenotype for use in genetic studies of nicotine dependence.",

    "abstract": "This case report demonstrates the use of ultrasound and doppler flow in the management of mono-amniotic monochorionic (M/M) twins. M/M twinning is a rare but significant event. It is associated with high rates of fetal mortality, most commonly cited at anywhere from between 30% and 70%. A common cause of death is cord entanglement. The case presented is that of a 19-year-old gravida 1 at 30 weeks with M/M twins in which multiple cord knots were found by ultrasound color doppler flow after variable fetal heart rate decelerations occurred. This prompted a decision for immediate cesarean delivery with normal fetal outcomes. Improvements in perinatal imaging systems are therefore beneficial in the management of M/M twins.",

    "abstract": "Early loss of one fetus in a multiple gestation as a 'vanishing' twin is a well recognized phenomenon. It is uncertain whether this has an impact on the development of the surviving co-twin. The aim of this study is to compare the development of singletons, twins and the surviving co-twins of a vanishing twin. The 324 children born to 229 women who were recruited into the study between 1999 and 2001 formed the study population. Children were assessed at 1 year of age with Griffiths Mental and Developmental Scales. A neurological examination was performed using an optimality score to exclude those with severe neurodisability. Three hundred and five children (92 singletons, 180 twins and 33 survivors with a vanishing twin) were included. The sub- and general quotient scores in singletons and surviving co-twins of a vanishing twin did not differ significantly. Twins had significantly lower scores than singletons in all areas of development and were more likely to be born early with lower birthweights. Following adjustment for gestation and birthweight, the difference between the two groups was nullified suggesting that the slower development of twins is related to their prematurity and lower birthweight.",

    "abstract": "Plasma lipids such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol and triglyceride levels contribute to variation in the risk of cardiovascular disease. The early stages of atherosclerosis in childhood have also been associated with changes in triglycerides, LDL and HDL. Heritability estimates for lipids and lipoproteins for adolescents are in the range .71 to .82, but little is known about changes of genetic and environmental influences over time in adolescence. We have investigated the contribution of genetic and environmental influences to variation in lipids in adolescent twins and their nontwin siblings using longitudinal twin and family data. Plasma HDL and LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides data from 965 twin pairs at 12, 14 and 16 years of age and their siblings have been analyzed. Longitudinal genetic models that included effects of age, sex and their interaction were fitted to assess whether the same or different genes influence each trait at different ages. Results suggested that more than one genetic factor influences HDL, LDL, total cholesterol and triglycerides over time at ages 12, 14 and 16 years. There was no evidence of shared environmental effects except for HDL and little evidence of long-term nonshared environmental effects was found. Our study suggested that there are developmental changes in the genes affecting plasma lipid concentrations across adolescence.",

    "abstract": "A previous publication reported the etiology of mathematics performance in 7-year-old twins (Oliver et al., 2004). As part of the same longitudinal study we investigated low mathematics performance and normal variation in a representative United Kingdom sample of 1713 same-sex 9-year-old twins based on teacher-assessed National Curriculum standards. Univariate individual differences and DeFries-Fulker extremes analyses were performed. Similar to our results at 7 years, all mathematics scores at 9 years showed high heritability (.62-.75) and low shared environmental estimates (.00-.11) for both the low performance group and the full sample. Longitudinal analyses were performed from 7 to 9 years. These longitudinal analyses indicated strong genetic continuity from 7 to 9 years for both low performance and mathematics in the normal range. We conclude that, despite the considerable differences in mathematics curricula from 7 to 9 years, the same genetic effects largely operate at the two ages.",

    "abstract": "The Twins' Early Development Study (TEDS) is a large-scale longitudinal study of twins from early childhood through adolescence. Since its conception, TEDS has had as its focus the study of problematic development within the context of normal variation, mainly in the development of language, cognitive and academic abilities and behavior problems from multivariate quantitative and molecular genetic perspectives. TEDS twins have been assessed at 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10 and (currently) 12 years of age, and DNA collected from more than 12,000 children. Identified from birth records of twins born in the United Kingdom between 1994 and 1996, more than 15,000 pairs of twins originally enrolled in TEDS, and well over 13,000 pairs--representative of the U.K. population--remain involved in the study to date. Similar to many other twin and adoption studies, TEDS data indicate that both genetic and environmental influences are important in nearly all areas of behavioral development. Multivariate genetic analyses allow researchers to go beyond this basic nature-nurture question, and TEDS results suggest that, especially in the area of learning abilities and disabilities, genes are generalists and environments are specialists. That is, genes largely contribute to similarity in performance within and between learning abilities and disabilities and across age, whereas the environment contributes to differences in performance. Quantitative genetic findings such as these chart the course for molecular genetic research. The TEDS dataset is proving valuable in genome-wide association research that tries to identify some of the many genes responsible for the ubiquitous heritability of behavior.",
