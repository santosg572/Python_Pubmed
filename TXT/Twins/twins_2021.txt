    "abstract": "A subset of spondyloarthritis (SpA) called 'reactive arthritis' is triggered by causal pathogens, usually bacteria related to venereal disease or gastrointestinal infection. During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there have been case reports about SpA after COVID-19, but the causality is still elusive. We described cases of 23-year-old monozygotic twins both diagnosed with SpA after COVID-19. The probable linkage between SpA and COVID-19 was elaborated with our cases as well as literature reviews. Of note, shared genetic traits by monozygotic twins, particularly HLA-B27 positivity, might have contributed to their susceptibility to COVID-19-induced SpA. Moreover, single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed that the transcriptomic profile of peripheral compartment of SpA after COVID-19 was distinctive from that of typical radiographic axial SpA as shown by differential expression of ribosomal protein S26 (RPS26) and small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5) in nearly all subsets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine use are highly comorbid and alarmingly prevalent in young adults. The hippocampus may be particularly sensitive to substance exposure. This remains largely untested in humans and familial risk may confound exposure effects. We extend prior work on alcohol and hippocampal volume in women by testing common and unique substance use effects and the potential moderating role of sex on hippocampal volume during emerging adulthood. A quasi-experimental cotwin control (CTC) design was used to separate familial risk from exposure consequences.\nIn a population-based sample of 435 24-year-old same-sex twins (58% women), dimensional measures (e.g. frequency, amount) of alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine use across emerging adulthood were assessed. Hippocampal volume was assessed using MRI.\nGreater substance use was significantly associated with lower hippocampal volume for women but not men. The same pattern was observed for alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine. CTC analyses provided evidence that hippocampal effects likely reflected familial risk and the consequence of substance use in general and alcohol and nicotine in particular; cannabis effects were in the expected direction but not significant. Within-pair mediation analyses suggested that the effect of alcohol use on the hippocampus may reflect, in part, comorbid nicotine use.\nThe observed hippocampal volume deviations in women likely reflected substance-related premorbid familial risk and the consequences of smoking and, to a lesser degree, drinking. Findings contribute to a growing body of work suggesting heightened risk among women toward experiencing deleterious effects of substance exposure on the still-developing young adult hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Supply chains of fresh fruit must maintain a very narrow window of hygrothermal conditions after harvest. Any excursions outside this range can markedly lower the consumer acceptability of the fruit. However, the loss in fruit quality and marketability largely remains invisible to stakeholders throughout the supply chain. Here we developed a physics-based digital twin of citrus fruit to pinpoint when, why and to what extent fruit quality and marketability are reduced. Sensor data on 47 commercial shipments are thereby translated into actionable metrics for supply chain stakeholders by mapping the variability using principal component analysis. We unveiled a large spread (between 3% and 60%) in the shipments for different metrics of quality and marketability. Half of the shipments currently lie outside the ideal trade-off range between maintaining quality, killing fruit fly larvae and avoiding chilling injury. The digital twin technology opens the possibility to obtain the real-time coupling with sensor data to monitor food quality and marketability.",

    "abstract": "In the traditional person re-identification model, the CNN network is usually used for feature extraction. When converting the feature map into a feature vector, a large number of convolution operations are used to reduce the size of the feature map. In CNN, since the receptive field of the latter layer is obtained by convolution operation on the feature map of the previous layer, the size of this local receptive field is limited, and the computational cost is large. For these problems, combined with the self-attention characteristics of Transformer, an end-to-end person re-identification model (twinsReID) is designed that integrates feature information between levels in this article. For Transformer, the output of each layer is the correlation between its previous layer and other elements. This operation is equivalent to the global receptive field because each element needs to calculate the correlation with other elements, and the calculation is simple, so its cost is small. From these perspectives, Transformer has certain advantages over CNN's convolution operation. This paper uses Twins-SVT Transformer to replace the CNN network, combines the features extracted from the two different stages and divides them into two branches. First, convolve the feature map to obtain a fine-grained feature map, perform global adaptive average pooling on the second branch to obtain the feature vector. Then divide the feature map level into two sections, perform global adaptive average pooling on each. These three feature vectors are obtained and sent to the Triplet Loss respectively. After sending the feature vectors to the fully connected layer, the output is input to the Cross-Entropy Loss and Center-Loss. The model is verified On the Market-1501 dataset in the experiments. The mAP/rank1 index reaches 85.4%/93.7%, and reaches 93.6%/94.9% after reranking. The statistics of the parameters show that the parameters of the model are less than those of the traditional CNN model.",

    "abstract": "Gardner's syndrome (GS) is a very rare autosomal dominant multisystem disease. Osteomas, skin and soft tissue tumors are present with gastrointestinal polyposis. The polyps have very high malignancy potentials. If prophylactic resection is not performed, colorectal cancer development is inevitable in all patients with GS. Polyposis is usually asymptomatic. Therefore, careful evaluation of extraintestinal findings of the disease is very important for early diagnosis. In this article, diagnosis and treatment of GS are presented in monozygotic twins, which have not been previously described in the literature. The diagnostic process, which started with dental complaints of one case, was carried out in an effective manner and then, prophylactic surgery was performed in twins. This article aimed to make clinicians and dentists attentive for early diagnosis of disease and to review treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Quadruplets are at elevated physical risks at prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal levels, relative to twins. A brief review of this area is followed by discussion of a female quadruplet with three co-quadruplet brothers. Next, several timely twin research reports are examined. The topics include antenatal corticosteroids and twins' neonatal outcomes, the meaning of fatherhood in families with twins, what doppelg\u00e4ngers (look-alikes) reveal about physical and behavioral similarity, and monozygotic (MZ) co-twin discordance for asymmetric pigmented paravenous chorioretinal atrophy. A lawsuit involving alleged cheating on a medical school examination by identical twins is also reviewed. General interest stories cover opposite-sex twin Holocaust survivors, twin models at a Gucci fashion show, twins with different fathers, reunited female twins who entered the same convent, the death of an MZ female twin soldier during training, and the surgical separation of conjoined twins in Brazil.",

    "abstract": "Innovative digital twins (DTs) that allow engineers to visualise, share information, and monitor the condition during operation is necessary to optimise railway construction and maintenance. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an approach for creating and managing an inventive 3D model simulating digital information that is useful to project management, monitoring and operation of a specific asset during the whole life cycle assessment (LCA). BIM application can help to provide an efficient cost management and time schedule and reduce the project delivery time throughout the whole life cycle of the project. In this study, an innovative DT has been developed using BIM integration through a life cycle analysis. Minnamurra Railway Bridge (MRB), Australia, has been chosen as a real-world use case to demonstrate the extended application of BIM (i.e., the DT) to enhance the operation, maintenance and asset management to improve the sustainability and resilience of the railway bridge. Moreover, the DT has been exploited to determine GHG emissions and cost consumption through the integration of BIM. This study demonstrates the feasibility of DT technology for railway maintenance and resilience optimisation. It also generates a virtual collaboration for co-simulations and co-creation of values across stakeholders participating in construction, operation and maintenance, and enhancing a reduction in costs and GHG emission.",

    "abstract": "Background: The prevalence of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases continues to rise globally and obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases. However, to our knowledge, evidence of the relative roles of genes and the environment underlying obesity and cardiometabolic disease traits and the correlations between them are still lacking, as is how they change with age. Method: Data were obtained from the Chinese National Twin Registry (CNTR). A total of 1421 twin pairs were included. Univariate structural equation models (SEMs) were performed to evaluate the heritability of BMI and cardiometabolic traits, which included blood hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Bivariate SEMs were used to assess the genetic/environmental correlations between them. The study population was divided into three groups for analysis: \u226450, 51\u221260, and >60 years old to assess the changes in heritability and genetic/environmental correlations with ageing. Results: Univariate SEMs showed a high heritability of BMI (72%) and cardiometabolic traits, which ranged from 30% (HbA1c) to 69% (HDL-C). With age increasing, the heritability of all phenotypes has different degrees of declining trends. Among these, BMI, SBP, and DBP presented significant monotonous declining trends. The bivariate SEMs indicated that BMI correlated with all cardiometabolic traits. The genetic correlations were estimated to range from 0.14 (BMI and LDL-C) to 0.39 (BMI and DBP), while the environmental correlations ranged from 0.13 (BMI and TC/LDL-C) to 0.31 (BMI and TG). The genetic contributions underlying the correlations between BMI and SBP and DBP, TC, TG, and HDL-C showed a progressive decrease as age groups increased. In contrast, environmental correlations displayed a significant increasing trend for HbA1c, SBP, and DBP. Conclusions: The findings suggest that genetic and environmental factors have essential effects on BMI and all cardiometabolic traits. However, as age groups increased, genetic influences presented varying degrees of decrement for BMI and most cardiometabolic traits, suggesting the increasing importance of environments. Genetic factors played a consistently larger role than environmental factors in the phenotypic correlations between BMI and cardiometabolic traits. Nevertheless, the relative magnitudes of genetic and environmental factors may change over time.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twins (MC) develop under unique intrauterine conditions and show a high risk of compromise during fetal life. Here we describe umbilical vein blood flow (UVBF) and fetal oxygen and glucose utilization in uncomplicated MC twins and investigate possible differences within twin-pairs according to birth-order.\nProspective single-center study on 48 uncomplicated MC twins enrolled at the time of elective cesarean delivery. Ultrasound measurements of UVBF for Twin 1 and Twin 2 labelled according to birth-order were performed before spinal anesthesia. Umbilical arterial and venous blood samples were collected for each twin after fetal delivery, and fetal oxygen and glucose deliveries and uptakes were computed.\nAll twins were delivered within 2\u00a0min from one-another under steady-state conditions at 36.4 weeks of median gestational age (IQR 36.0-37.0). Birthweight and umbilical cord gas analyses were within physiological ranges for all twins. Second-born twins showed significantly lower UVBF, measured before delivery, and lower median birthweight compared to first-borns. Moreover, median values of estimated fetal oxygen and glucose consumption were lower in second compared to first MC twins.\nUncomplicated MC twins show different birthweight, oxygenation and metabolic rates based on their position in utero, hinting at pre-existing conditions possibly deriving by uneven vascular and metabolic distribution of the two placental territories. The innovative findings of this study emphasize the biological uniqueness of these pregnancies and prompt further physiological studies on MC twins and placenta metabolism.",

    "abstract": "This work emphasizes that patient data, including images, are not operable (clinically), but that digital twins are. Based on the former, the latter can be created. Subsequently, virtual clinical operations can be performed towards selection of optimal therapies. Digital twins are beginning to emerge in the field of medicine. We suggest that theranostic digital twins (TDTs) are amongst the most natural and feasible flavors of digitals twins. We elaborate on the importance of TDTs in a future where 'one-size-fits-all' therapeutic schemes, as prevalent nowadays, are transcended in radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPTs). Personalized RPTs will be deployed, including optimized intervention parameters. Examples include optimization of injected radioactivities, sites of injection, injection intervals and profiles, and combination therapies. Multi-modal multi-scale images, combined with other data and aided by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, will be utilized towards routine digital twinning of our patients, and will enable improved deliveries of RPTs and overall healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Earth's magnetotail plays a critical role in the dynamics of the magnetosphere, particularly during intervals of geomagnetic activity. To improve our understanding of the ion dynamics in this region, energetic neutral atom (ENA) imaging can provide global measurements to place in situ measurements in context and validate simulations. The NASA Two Wide-angle Imaging Neutral-atom Spectrometers mission provided near-continuous observations using ENA imagers. ENA data can be used to calculate maps of equatorial ion temperatures that often show observations of regions of enhanced temperatures associated with phenomena in the magnetotail such as magnetic reconnection and narrow flow channels. We present an algorithm that can be used to search through a collection of these maps to identify intervals with such enhancements for further study. The algorithm results are validated against two sets of related phenomena: (a) a database of dipolarizing flux bundle (DFB) measurements from THEMIS and (b) a list of substorm onsets from SuperMAG. We demonstrate that the algorithm is very good at identifying intervals when there are DFB measurements or substorm onsets as long as there sufficient ENA data. We discuss some potential scientific studies that can result from use of the algorithm. We also show a preliminary application of the algorithm to simulation output to demonstrate the usefulness for other datasets, facilitate comparative studies, and introduce a new method for model validation.",

    "abstract": "We describe new types of Lorenz-like attractors for three-dimensional flows and maps with symmetries. We give an example of a three-dimensional system of differential equations, which is centrally symmetric and mirror symmetric. We show that the system has a Lorenz-like attractor, which contains three saddle equilibrium states and consists of two mirror-symmetric components that are adjacent at the symmetry plane. We also found a discrete-time analog of this \"conjoined-twins\" attractor in a cubic three-dimensional H\u00e9non map with a central symmetry. We show numerically that both attractors are pseudohyperbolic, which guarantees that each orbit of the attractor has a positive maximal Lyapunov exponent, and this property is preserved under small perturbations. We also describe bifurcation scenarios for the emergence of the attractors in one-parameter families of three-dimensional flows and maps possessing the symmetries.",

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in identical twins is rare. Cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with homogenous and heterogeneous phenotypes have been described in the literature.\nWe report a pair of monozygotic twins (Twin A and Twin B) with identical morphological expression of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. On initial evaluation, both twins had resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, Grade II diastolic dysfunction, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II symptoms, but they had a different clinical course afterward. Twin A progressed from NYHA Class II to Class III with a high left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient that was unresponsive to medical treatment and required alcohol septal ablation. Twin B responded very well to medical treatment. Both patients had no risk factors for sudden cardiac death, and neither required an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.\nThe morphology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has a strong genetic basis, but epigenetic factors may affect disease expression.",

    "abstract": "Preterm-associated complications remain the main cause of neonatal death. Survivors face the challenges of short- and long-term complications. Among all complications, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the first important cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Current treatment does not address this main preterm complication. Cord blood is regarded as a convenient source of stem cells. The paracrine bioactive factors of stem cells contribute to tissue repair and immune modulation. Our clinical studies and those of others have shown that cord blood cell infusion is both safe and possibly effective in the prevention and treatment of BPD. The therapeutic use of cord blood has emerged as a promising therapy. However, the genetic heterogeneity between control and intervention groups may reduce the comparability especially among small sample trials. The purpose of this study protocol is to investigate the effects of autologous cord blood mononuclear cell (ACBMNC) infusion on the prevention of BPD in very preterm monozygotic twins of less than 32 gestation weeks.\nIn this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded multicenter clinical trial, 60 pairs of monozygotic twin preterm neonates of less than 32 weeks admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit are randomly assigned to receive intravenous ACBMNC infusion (targeted at 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nThis will be the first randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial to evaluate the efficacy of ACBMNC infusion to prevent BPD in monozygotic twin premature infants and investigate the underlying protective mechanisms. The results of this trial will provide valuable clinical evidence for translational application of cord blood cell therapy in very preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "A geometric digital twin (gDT) model capable of leveraging acquired 3D geometric data plays a vital role in digitizing the process of structural health monitoring. This study presents a framework for generating and updating digital twins of existing buildings by inferring semantic information from as-is point clouds (gDT's data) acquired regularly from laser scanners (gDT's connection). The information is stored in updatable Building Information Models (BIMs) as gDT's virtual model, and dimensional outputs are extracted for structural health monitoring (gDT's service) of different structural members and shapes (gDT's physical part). First, geometric information, including position and section shape, is obtained from the acquired point cloud using domain-specific contextual knowledge and supervised classification. Then, structural members' function and section family type is inferred from geometric information. Finally, a BIM is automatically generated or updated as the virtual model of an existing facility and incorporated within the gDT for structural health monitoring. Experiments on real-world construction data are performed to illustrate the efficiency and precision of the proposed model for creating as-is gDT of building structural members.",

    "abstract": "Young children in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), particularly those from resource-limited settings, are heavily burdened by anemia and malaria. While malaria infected children frequently become anemic (hemoglobin < 110 g/L), anemia is a strongly multifactorial disease with many other risk factors than malaria. Due to the complex and often overlapping contributors to anemia, it remains challenging to isolate the true impact of malaria on population level hemoglobin concentrations.\nWe quantified the malaria-induced effect on hemoglobin levels in children under 5 years of age, leveraging data from 7,384 twins and other multiples, aged 6 to 59 months, from 57 nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) from 23 SSA countries from 2006 to 2019. The quasi-experimental twin fixed-effect design let us minimize the impact of potential confounders that do not vary between twins.\nOur analyses of twins revealed a malaria-induced hemoglobin decrease in infected twins of 9 g/L (95% CI -10; -7, \nEven after rigorous control for confounding through a twin fixed-effects study design, malaria substantially decreased hemoglobin levels among SSA twins, rendering them much more susceptible to severe anemia. This effect reflects the population-level effect of malaria on anemia.",

    "abstract": "Radar is widely employed in many applications, especially in autonomous driving. At present, radars are only designed as simple data collectors, and they are unable to meet new requirements for real-time and intelligent information processing as environmental complexity increases. It is inevitable that smart radar systems will need to be developed to deal with these challenges and digital twins in cyber-physical systems (CPS) have proven to be effective tools in many aspects. However, human involvement is closely related to radar technology and plays an important role in the operation and management of radars; thus, digital twins' radars in CPS are insufficient to realize smart radar systems due to the inadequate consideration of human factors. ACP-based parallel intelligence in cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS) is used to construct a novel framework for smart radars, called Parallel Radars. A Parallel Radar consists of three main parts: a Descriptive Radar for constructing artificial radar systems in cyberspace, a Predictive Radar for conducting computational experiments with artificial systems, and a Prescriptive Radar for providing prescriptive control to both physical and artificial radars to complete parallel execution. To connect silos of data and protect data privacy, federated radars are proposed. Additionally, taking mines as an example, the application of Parallel Radars in autonomous driving is discussed in detail, and various experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of Parallel Radars.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS) is a complication in monochorionic-diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies. This study analyzes whether the prenatal diagnosis using delta middle cerebral artery-peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) > 0.5 multiples of the median (MoM) (delta group) detects more TAPS cases than the guideline-based diagnosis using the MCA-PSV cut off levels of >1.5 and <1.0 MoM (cut-off group), in a heterogenous group of MCDA twins. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 348 live-born MCDA twin pregnancies from 2010 to 2021 with available information on MCA-PSV within one week before delivery and hemoglobin-values within 24 h postnatally were considered eligible. Results: Among postnatal confirmed twin pairs with TAPS, the cut-off group showed lower sensitivity than the delta group (33% vs. 82%). Specificity proved higher in the cut-off group with 97% than in the delta group at 86%. The risk that a TAPS is mistakenly not recognized prenatally is higher in the cut-off group than in the delta group (52% vs. 18%). Conclusions: Our data shows that delta MCA-PSV > 0.5 MoM detects more cases of TAPS, which would not have been diagnosed prenatally according to the current guidelines. In the collective examined in the present study, TAPS diagnostics using delta MCA-PSV proved to be a more robust method.",

    "abstract": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by enzyme deficiencies required for cortisol biosynthesis in the adrenal cortex. The majority of CAH are due to the deficiency of the 21-hydroxylase enzyme, while 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 deficiency accounts for less than five percent of all CAH cases. We report two Moroccan twins from a spontaneous triplet pregnancy. The 46,XY newborn exhibited a disorder of sexual differentiation (DSD) with hypo virilization, while the 46,XX newborn had normal female external genitalia. In the first week of life, they showed hyponatremia and primary adrenal insufficiency with a slight 17OHP elevation and increased DHEAS and renin levels.

    "abstract": "This case study describes the impact of the 'Planning Health in School' programme (PHS-pro) on the nutritional status and lifestyle behaviours of two twins with obesity. As part of a larger research project involving 449 adolescents in grade-6, PHS-pro aims at preventing obesity and guiding children towards healthy behaviours. Twins were evaluated for anthropometric measurements-height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and lifestyle behaviours before (baseline) and after (8 months) PHS-pro and at a follow-up (one-year later). At the baseline, both twins were obese according to the international cut-off points of Cole. After PHS-pro, improvements in anthropometric parameters were found: the boy decreased his BMI by 10% and lost 9.0 cm in WC, while remaining obese; the girl decreased her BMI by 8% and lost 8.7 cm in WC, changing to the overweight category. At the follow-up, a slight increase in the anthropometric parameters was found in both twins; however, they did not return to the baseline values. The programme successfully promoted positive changes in behaviours and improved nutritional status, showing the long-term effects of the PHS-pro. Although it is a school-based intervention to prevent obesity, the PHS-pro is helpful in weight reduction even in children already with obesity.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between abnormal umbilical cord insertion and birthweight discordance in monochorionic diamnionic (MCDA) twins. A total of 137 pairs of MCDAs were retrospectively analyzed who delivered and survived in Hangzhou Women's Hospital from January 2016 to December 2021. According to different insertion methods, they were divided into normal cord insertion group (n\u2005=\u200557), marginal cord insertion (MCI) group (n\u2005=\u200534) and velamentous cord insertion (VCI) group (n\u2005=\u200546). The correlation was analyzed between different insertion methods of umbilical cord and the discordant birth weight of MCDAs. The gestational age of delivery with velamentous cord insertion was significantly earlier than those with normal and marginal insertion (P\u2005<\u2005.05). There were significant differences in birthweight between large fetus (F1) and small fetus (F2) with different umbilical insertion methods (P\u2005<\u2005.05). The birthweight of F1 and F2 in normal insertion group was significantly higher than those in MCI and VCI group (P\u2005<\u2005.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that VCI was significantly associated with birth weight in F1/F2, birthweight discordance\u2005\u2265\u200520%, and birthweight discordance\u2005\u2265\u200525%, however MCI and VCI were not an independent factor for discordance in birthweight of MCDAs (P\u2005>\u2005.05). Umbilical cord insertion method can lead to inconsistency in birthweight of MCDA twins, however they were not an independent factor for discordance in birthweight.",

    "abstract": "Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is the leading nonhereditary cause of pediatric sensorineural hearing loss. This systematic review evaluated infection concordance and comparative hearing abilities in twins/multiple births to model infection patterns.\nPubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.\nStudies that reported hearing outcomes of congenital cytomegalovirus infection in at least one multiple birth were eligible. Concordant infections (both twins) and discordant infections (single twin) were included. Multiple reviewers performed data extraction and quality assessment. Analyses involved relative risk of infection concordance by zygosity and chorionicity and odds of hearing loss by infection concordance. Hearing outcomes were compared between siblings.\nOf 247 studies screened, 31 were included (74.2% high quality). The review captured 40 eligible multiple births. Among infected patients, 42.9% (95% confidence interval, 31.2-55.2%) demonstrated hearing loss. All uninfected twins had normal hearing. Most infections were concordant, and infected patients experienced 4.11 (1.18-14.36) times greater odds of hearing loss if their twin was also infected ( p = .02). Yet siblings' hearing outcomes diverged in over 40% of concordant cases. If either twin is infected, infection risk in the second twin is 3.25 (1.83-5.79) times greater in monozygotic than dizygotic twins and 2.50 (1.61-3.88) times greater in monochorionic than dichorionic twins (both p < .001). We describe a case from our practice.\nCongenital cytomegalovirus infection patterns and hearing outcomes can vary widely even within a shared fetal and postnatal environment. Suspected infection in a twin indicates that both should receive testing and continued monitoring for late-onset sequelae.",

    "abstract": "Disorders of or differences in sexual development (DSD) are defined by congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomic sex are atypical. Here, we report on monochorionic diamniotic twins delivered by caesarean section in the 36th week of pregnancy. Monochorionic twins are usually monozygous and thus should have the same sexual differentiation. In this case, one twin had female external genitalia, while the other showed ambiguous genitalia. At first, a diagnosis of mixed gonadal dysgenesis was proposed because of the obvious sexual discrepancy between the supposedly monozygous twins. Cytogenetic analyses were performed to assure the sex chromosome status for both children. Male and female cells were found subsequently in both children. While hematopoietic chimerism of monochorionic dizygous twins as a result of twin-to-twin blood transfusion is a rare but already well-documented phenomenon, to our knowledge this is the first case description of tetragametic chimerism that led to intersexuality.",

    "abstract": "To compare the outcomes of dichorionic triamniotic (DCTA) triplets with that of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin gestations undergoing fetoscopic laser surgery (FLS) for treatment of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS).\nRetrospective cohort study of prospectively collected data of consecutive DCTA triplet and MCDA twin pregnancies with TTTS that underwent FLS at two fetal treatment centers between 2012 and 2020. Preoperative, operative and, postoperative variables were collected. Perinatal outcomes were investigated. Primary outcome was survival to birth and to neonatal period. Secondary outcomes were gestational age (GA) at birth and procedure-to-delivery interval. Literature review was conducted in which PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from inception to September, 2020.\nTwenty four sets of DCTA triplets were compared to MCDA twins during the study period. There were no significant differences in survival (no survivor, single, or double survivors) to birth and to the neonatal period of the MC twin pairs of the DCTA triplets \nPerinatal survival including fetal and neonatal are comparable between DCTA triplets and MCDA twins. However, this might have resulted from the small sample size of the DCTA triplets. GA at delivery is earlier in triplets, which could be due to the nature of triplet gestation rather than to the laser procedure itself.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a heterogeneous, fatal neurodegenerative disease, characterized by motor neuron loss and in 50% of cases also by cognitive and/or behavioral changes. Mendelian forms of ALS comprise approximately 10-15% of cases. The majority is however considered sporadic, but also with a high contribution of genetic risk factors. To explore the contribution of somatic mutations and/or epigenetic changes to disease risk, we performed whole genome sequencing and methylation analyses using samples from multiple tissues on a cohort of 26 monozygotic twins discordant for ALS, followed by in-depth validation and replication experiments. The results of these analyses implicate several mechanisms in ALS pathophysiology, which include a role for de novo mutations, defects in DNA damage repair and accelerated aging.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate cardiac findings in newborn twins from the general population and investigate if newborn twins may require systematic evaluation of cardiac parameters.\nProspective cohort study of newborns with cardiac evaluation performed during the first month of life. Cardiac findings were compared 1:3 with matched singletons.\nWe included 412 newborn twins (16% monochorionic; 50% boys) and 1236 singletons. Comparing cardiac findings showed twins had an increased prevalence of non-severe structural heart disease (most common: ventricular septal defects in both groups), thinner left ventricular posterior wall in diastole (LVPWd; 1.82 vs. 1.87\u2009mm, p\u00a0=\u20090.02), smaller diameter of the left atrium (10.6 vs. 11.1\u2009mm, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), higher heart rate (148 vs. 144\u2009bpm, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), more left-shifted QRS axis (106 vs. 111\u00b0, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and lower maximum R-wave amplitude in V1 (927 vs. 1015\u2009\u03bcV, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) compared to singletons. After multifactorial adjustment for potential confounders, the effect of twinning on cardiac parameters persisted only for LVPWd (p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nDespite contemporary surveillance, we found an increased prevalence of non-severe structural heart disease in a population-based cohort of newborn twins. However, the effect of twinning on cardiac parameters was modest and generally did not persist after correction for likely confounding factors.",

    "abstract": "New technologies enable the creation of digital twin systems (DTS) combining continuous data collection from children's home and artificial intelligence (AI)-based recommendations to adapt their care in real time. The objective was to assess whether children and adolescents with asthma would be ready to use such DTS. A mixed-method study was conducted with 104 asthma patients aged 8 to 17\u00a0years. The potential advantages and disadvantages associated with AI and the use of DTS were collected in semi-structured interviews. Children were then asked whether they would agree to use a DTS for the daily management of their asthma. The strength of their decision was assessed as well as the factors determining their choice. The main advantages of DTS identified by children were the possibility to be (i) supported in managing their asthma (ii) from home and (iii) in real time. Technical issues and the risk of loss of humanity were the main drawbacks reported. Half of the children (56%) were willing to use a DTS for the daily management of their asthma if it was as effective as current care, and up to 93% if it was more effective. Those with the best computer skills were more likely to choose the DTS, while those who placed a high value on the physician-patient relationship were less likely to do so.\u00a0 \u00a0Conclusions: The majority of children were ready to use a DTS for the management of their asthma, particularly if it was more effective than current care. The results of this study support the development of DTS for childhood asthma and the evaluation of their effectiveness in clinical trials. What is Known: \u2022 New technologies enable the creation of digital twin systems (DTS) for children with asthma. \u2022 Acceptance of these DTSs by children with asthma is unknown. What is New: \u2022 Half of the children (56%) were willing to use a DTS for the daily management of their asthma if it was as effective as current care, and up to 93% if it was more effective. \u2022Children identified the ability to be supported from home and in real time as the main benefits of DTS.",

    "abstract": "Pharmaceutical product development guided by Quality by Design (QbD) is based on a complete understanding of the critical process parameters (CPPs) that are important for achieving the desired product critical quality attributes (CQAs). The effect of process settings, such as the screw speed, the throughput, the barrel temperature, and the screw configuration, is a well-known factor in the setup of pharmaceutical hot melt extrusion (HME) processes. A CPP that has not yet been extensively researched is the type of cross-section geometry of the screw elements. Typically, pharmaceutical extruders have double-flighted screw cross-sections, with some elements having a single- or triple-flighted element section. The exception is a NANO16 extruder from Leistritz, with all screw elements having a triple-flighted screw geometry. We investigated the process setup and scale-up to a double-flighted extruder experimentally and in silico via a digital twin. Two formulations were processed on a NANO16 extruder and virtually transferred to a ZSE18 double-flighted co-rotating twin-screw extruder. Detailed smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of all screw elements available from both extruders were performed, and their efficiency in conveying, pressure build-up, and power consumption were studied. Reduced-order 1D HME simulations, which were carried out to investigate the process space and scalability of both extruders, were experimentally validated.",

    "abstract": "The clinical presentation of COVID-19 shows a remarkably broad spectrum of symptoms. Although studies with adult twins on SARS-CoV-2 infection are rare so far, the fact that there is a genetic component associated with the highly variable clinical outcomes of COVID-19 has already been highlighted in recent studies investigating potential candidate genes and polymorphisms. This is the first study of adult monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins concordantly affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection to estimate variances explained by genetic, shared, and individual environmental components of both somatic and psychological symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nData were collected from 10 adult twin pairs (5 MZ, 5 DZ) in which both twins already had a SARS-CoV-2 infection. A self-designed questionnaire, the Barthel Index, and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) were used to assess various symptoms and health status following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intra-class correlations were calculated, and the Falconer formula was used to quantify and differentiate the percentages of genetic influences as well as common environment and personal experiences on the examined traits. In addition, potential factors influencing symptom burden were examined and discussed.\nWe found high estimated heritability for mental impairment after SARS-CoV-2 infection (\nBoth genetics and individual environment play a role in health status after SARS-CoV-2 infection-mental status could be influenced primarily by genetic make-up, whereas for symptom burden and certain fatigue dimensions, non-shared environment could play a more critical role. Possible individual factors influencing the course of the disease were identified. However, gene-environment interactions may still be a source of differences between twins, and the search for candidate genes remains crucial on the road to personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "The exact cause of complete endocardial cushion defect (ECD) is still unknown. This report describes a unique pair of monozygotic twins (MZ twins) discordant for ECD. The chromosome karyotyping analysis revealed normal karyotype of 46, XY, 16qh+ and mat in both MZ twins. A genome-wide analysis of DNA using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 revealed identical genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs). An extensive methylation assay was carried out by NimbleGen 3 \u00d7 720 K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter Arrays to analyze the potential epigenetic differences. The DNA methylation profiles of the affected twin seemed increased compared with that of the unaffected twin. However, further validation of Notch1 promoter hypermethylation and six top-ranked differentially methylated CpG sites by sodium bisulfate modification and methylation-specific PCR, failed to reveal consistent methylation differences between the twins. Other relevant factors, such as heritability and penetrance of the condition that place the MZ twins near to a threshold for ECD or variations in local epigenetic events in the twins' heart tissues, are probably responsible for the phenotypic discordance.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins technology (DTT) is an application framework with breakthrough rules. With the deep integration of the virtual information world and physical space, it becomes the basis for realizing intelligent machining production lines, which is of great significance to intelligent processing in industrial manufacturing. This review aims to study the application of DTT and the Metaverse in fluid machinery in the past 5 years by summarizing the application status of pumps and fans in fluid machinery from the perspective of DTT and the Metaverse through the collection, classification, and summary of relevant literature in the past 5 years. The research found that in addition to relatively mature applications in intelligent manufacturing, DTT and Metaverse technologies play a critical role in the development of new pump products and technologies and are widely used in numerical simulation and fault detection in fluid machinery for various pumps and other fields. Among fan-type fluid machinery, twin fans can comprehensively use technologies, such as perception, calculation, modeling, and deep learning, to provide efficient smart solutions for fan operation detection, power generation visualization, production monitoring, and operation monitoring. Still, there are some limitations. For example, real-time and accuracy cannot fully meet the requirements in the mechanical environment with high-precision requirements. However, there are also some solutions that have achieved good results. For instance, it is possible to achieve significant noise reduction and better aerodynamic performance of the axial fan by improving the sawtooth parameters of the fan and rearranging the sawtooth area. However, there are few application cases of the Metaverse in fluid machinery. The cases are limited to operating real equipment from a virtual environment and require the combination of virtual reality and DTT. The application effect still needs further verification.",

    "abstract": "Digital Twins concept presents a new trend in virtual material science, common to all computational techniques. Digital twins, virtual devices and intellectual products, presenting the main constituents of the concept, are considered in detail on the example of a complex problem, which concerns an amazing identity of the D-G-doublet Raman spectra of parental and reduced graphene oxides. Digital twins, presenting different aspects of the GO and rGO structure and properties, were virtually synthesized using a spin-density algorithm emerging from the Hartree-Fock approximation. Virtual device presents AM1 version of the semi-empirical unrestricted HF approximation. The equilibrium structure of the twins as well as virtual one-phonon harmonic spectra of IR absorption and Raman scattering constitute a set of intellectual products. It was established that in both cases the D-G doublets owe their origin to the ",

    "abstract": "During the pandemic, mental health was not only impaired in people after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also in people without previous infection. This is the first study on twins without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection to estimate the influence of genetic components and shared as well as individual environments on pandemic-associated fatigue. The study sample included 55 monozygotic and 45 dizygotic twin pairs. A total of 34.5% reported an increase in fatigue since the pandemic. A significant correlation was shown between the responses within monozygotic (\u03c72[1] = 11.14, p = 0.001) and dizygotic pairs (\u03c72[1] = 18.72, p < 0.001). In all pandemic-associated fatigue dimensions, individual environment (ranging from e2 = 0.64 to e2 = 0.84) and heritability (ranging from h2 = 0.32 to h2 = 1.04) seem to have the highest impact. The number of comorbidities significantly correlated with physical fatigue (Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 = 0.232, p < 0.001) and psychological impairment due to pandemic measures with the total fatigue score (Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 = 0.243, p < 0.001). However, calculated ANCOVAs with these significant correlations as covariates showed no significant influence on the mean values of the respective fatigue dimensions. Susceptibility to pandemic-associated fatigue may be genetically and environmentally determined, while intensity is also influenced by individual components. The prevalence of fatigue is high even in individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future mental health prevention and intervention programs should be implemented to alleviate the impact of the pandemic on the global population.",

    "abstract": "The use of healthcare services is likely to be associated with need but also the factors relating to the care system and the ability to negotiate around it. Healthcare use and health status may also be associated with the factors that exist in childhood. This study aims to identify the demographic, clinical, and cognitive characteristics of children at age 4 that impact healthcare use and health status at age 21. The data from the Twins Early Development Study were used. Health problems, healthcare use, and cognitive ability at age 4 were entered into generalised estimating equations to predict the use of general practitioners, outpatient services, counselling, emergency clinic visits, and a healthcare helpline at age 21. Similar models existed for the prediction of whether problems were recorded on the EQ-5D-5L EuroQol instrument. The data on up to 6707 individuals were available for analysis. Sex was a significant predictor of service use, with boys being more likely than girls to later use all services, except for emergency clinic visits. Certain health conditions at age 4 predicted the use of services with models differing according to service type. Greater general cognitive ability predicted higher use of general practitioners, outpatient care, and health helplines. The current health status was strongly predictive of service use. Service use in young adulthood was significantly related to concurrent health status as well as health conditions in childhood. General cognitive ability was significantly associated with the use of general practitioner contacts, outpatient visits, and the use of a health helpline.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear technology is widely used for hydrocarbon exploration by deploying nuclear tools of detection to help obtain important parameters of a given geographical formation. Monte Carlo software is generally used to simulate nuclear tools in the environment of well logging, to accurately predict their responses downhole. In other words, a digital Monte Carlo twin of the designated tool is constructed, and its responses, are used to identify features that are important, for instance, for assessing the feasibility of deployment of the tool or optimizing the design of its hardware. However, the downhole environment is complex and changeable, such that it is determined by many parameters, e.g., the formation, the fluid, and the structure of the well. A significant modeling setup is thus often required to be able to consider all environmental variations, where this increases the burden on field engineers who need to construct several batches of repetitive models to simulate the same tool in a variety of environments. The appropriate automation of this process is thus highly desirable. In this work, the authors propose downhole Geant4-based Monte Carlo Automated Computational Platform (GMAC) to develop digital twins of nuclear tools. We construct a platform that enables us to design a Monte Carlo digital twin of a given nuclear tool. GMAC can automate the process of simulating the tool under various environments based on minimum user input and provide a comprehensive evaluation of its performance. The proposed platform also provides feasible means to optimize the tool by connecting the CAE twin directly to the Monte Carlo twin. The main structure and developer/user functions of the GMAC are discussed in detail. Three examples of nuclear tools are also provided to detail and verify its complete process from tool design to application. The results confirm the correctness and efficiency of the proposed computational platform.",

    "abstract": "Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Growth discordance is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia in twin pregnancies. The management of preeclampsia combined with discordant twins is difficult and controversial because of severe maternal conditions and severe growth restriction in 1 twin.\nA 34-year-old woman with dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia at 29 weeks of gestation, and 1 twin with severe growth restriction and fetal intracranial hemorrhage.\nThe patient developed severe preeclampsia with high blood pressure (>160/100\u2009mm Hg) and proteinuria, hydrothorax and leg edema. Ultrasound examination confirmed growth restriction (weight estimation: 915\u2009g, <1st percentile) and abnormal umbilical flow in 1 twin (twin B), with a normal co-twin (estimated weight: 1693\u2009g) (twin A). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed intracranial hemorrhage in the germinal matrix of twin B.\nSelective termination of twin B by intracardiac injection of potassium chloride was performed at 31 weeks and 2 days' gestation.\nSymptoms of preeclampsia resolved after selective termination, allowing the pregnancy to be prolonged for nearly 4 weeks. A healthy female infant was delivered at 35 weeks of gestation.\nDelivery of both fetus is not the only choice for the management for twin pregnancy with severe preeclampsia and discordant twins. Selective termination of the fetus with poor prognosis could be a reasonable treatment choice in carefully selected cases.",

    "abstract": "We propose a unified data-driven reduced order model (ROM) that bridges the performance gap between linear and nonlinear manifold approaches. Deep learning ROM (DL-ROM) using deep-convolutional autoencoders (DC-AE) has been shown to capture nonlinear solution manifolds but fails to perform adequately when linear subspace approaches such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) would be optimal. Besides, most DL-ROM models rely on convolutional layers, which might limit its application to only a structured mesh. The proposed framework in this study relies on the combination of an autoencoder (AE) and Barlow Twins (BT) self-supervised learning, where BT maximizes the information content of the embedding with the latent space through a joint embedding architecture. Through a series of benchmark problems of natural convection in porous media, BT-AE performs better than the previous DL-ROM framework by providing comparable results to POD-based approaches for problems where the solution lies within a linear subspace as well as DL-ROM autoencoder-based techniques where the solution lies on a nonlinear manifold; consequently, bridges the gap between linear and nonlinear reduced manifolds. We illustrate that a proficient construction of the latent space is key to achieving these results, enabling us to map these latent spaces using regression models. The proposed framework achieves a relative error of 2% on average and 12% in the worst-case scenario (i.e., the training data is small, but the parameter space is large.). We also show that our framework provides a speed-up of [Formula: see text] times, in the best case, and [Formula: see text] times on average compared to a finite element solver. Furthermore, this BT-AE framework can operate on unstructured meshes, which provides flexibility in its application to standard numerical solvers, on-site measurements, experimental data, or a combination of these sources.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with incidence of cardiovascular disease and with nocturnal angina, but evidence of a link with coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial ischemia is limited and previous studies may have been affected by selection bias or unmeasured confounding factors.\nWe performed overnight polysomnography in 178 older male twins. The Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI) was calculated to assess OSA from the overnight sleep evaluation. AHI \u226515 was used as indicator of moderate/severe OSA. The following day, twins underwent myocardial perfusion imaging with [82Rb]-chloride positron emission tomography. Quantitative and semiquantitative measures of myocardial perfusion and absolute myocardial blood flow were obtained.\nThe mean age was 68 years and 40% of the sample had an AHI\u226515, which indicates moderate to severe OSA. Abnormal myocardial perfusion, both with stress and at rest, was more common in twins with elevated AHI. After adjusting for clinical, lifestyle and behavioral factors, and previous history of cardiovascular disease, twins with AHI \u226515 had 3.6 higher odds (95% CI, 1.5-8.9) of an abnormal total severity score, defined as a score \u2265100, and for each 5-point increment in AHI, the odds of abnormality increased by 20% (95% CI, 7%-34%). Twin pairs where both twins had OSA exhibited the greatest risk. There were no differences in measures of ischemia and absolute myocardial blood flow and flow reserve by AHI status.\nOSA is associated with myocardial perfusion abnormalities that suggest prior subclinical myocardial scarring or infarction. Early environmental factors that affect both twins equally may play a role and should be further explored.",

    "results": "The mean age was 68 years and 40% of the sample had an AHI\u226515, which indicates moderate to severe OSA. Abnormal myocardial perfusion, both with stress and at rest, was more common in twins with elevated AHI. After adjusting for clinical, lifestyle and behavioral factors, and previous history of cardiovascular disease, twins with AHI \u226515 had 3.6 higher odds (95% CI, 1.5-8.9) of an abnormal total severity score, defined as a score \u2265100, and for each 5-point increment in AHI, the odds of abnormality increased by 20% (95% CI, 7%-34%). Twin pairs where both twins had OSA exhibited the greatest risk. There were no differences in measures of ischemia and absolute myocardial blood flow and flow reserve by AHI status.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) by comparing disease concordance in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. This cross-sectional study analyzed 1294 (1040 monozygotic and 254 dizygotic) twin pairs (>20 years) based on the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study data (2005\u22122014). The odds ratios of disease concordance were calculated using binomial and multinomial logistic regression models. The occurrence of CMDs (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, cerebral stroke, transient ischemic attack, and ischemic heart disease) and related physical and laboratory levels did not differ between the monozygotic and dizygotic twin groups. The odds for concordance of the presence/absence of CMDs and the likelihood of incident CMD within monozygotic twins were comparable to that of dizygotic twins. The absolute differences in hemoglobin A1c, insulin, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure were lower in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins. Absolute differences in fasting glucose and diastolic blood pressure did not differ between groups. Although baseline levels of several laboratory parameters related to CMD showed a strong likelihood of heritability in monozygotic twins, CMD phenotype appears to be largely affected by environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the mode of birth in early-preterm, late-preterm, and near-term twins as well as to compare the maternal and neonatal outcomes of each group following vaginal birth (VB) and lower-segment cesarean section (LSCS).\nA prospective cohort study was conducted of 100 twin pregnancies in a tertiary center between 2018 and 2019. Deliveries were allocated into the following three gestational age groups (weeks\u2009\u00b1\u2009days) and compared: (1) early-preterm (28 to 31\u2009\u00b1\u20096), (2) late-preterm (32 to 35\u2009\u00b1\u20096), and (3) near-term (\u226536\u2009weeks).\nThe proportion of VB and LSCS were similar when early-preterm twins (P\u00a0=\u20090.766; relative risk [RR], 1.08) and late-preterm twins (P\u00a0=\u20090.071; RR, 1.21) were compared separately with near-term twins. Perinatal outcomes did not differ between VB and LSCS within each gestational age group. When compared with the near-term group, the early-preterm group had more hypoglycemia (P\u00a0<\u20090.001), hyperbilirubinemia (P\u00a0<\u20090.001), respiratory distress (P\u00a0<\u20090.001), low APGAR scores (P\u00a0<\u20090.001), and death (P\u00a0<\u20090.001) irrespective of the mode of birth. The late-preterm group had lower morbidity and mortality (P\u00a0=\u20090.227). Postpartum hemorrhage and blood transfusion were similar between the groups.\nThe proportion of VB and LSCS and associated maternal and neonatal outcomes did not differ in twins of different gestational ages. The data provide reassurance to practitioners to perform vaginal delivery in preterm twins.",

    "abstract": "Studies that focus on individual covariates, while ignoring their interactions, may not be adequate for model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) in any given patient. Genetic variations that influence protein synthesis should be studied in conjunction with environmental covariates, such as cigarette smoking. The aim of this study was to build virtual twins (VTs) of real patients receiving clozapine with interacting covariates related to genetics and environment and to delineate the impact of interacting covariates on predicted clozapine plasma concentrations. Clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia (N\u00a0=\u00a042) with observed clozapine plasma concentrations, demographic, environmental, and genotype data were used to construct VTs in Simcyp. The effect of increased covariate virtualization was assessed by performing simulations under three conditions: \"low\" (demographic), \"medium\" (demographic and environmental interaction), and \"high\" (demographic and environmental/genotype interaction) covariate virtualization. Increasing covariate virtualization with interaction improved the coefficient of variation (R",

    "abstract": "An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed on buccal cells from monozygotic-twins (MZ) reared together as children, but who live apart as adults. Cohorts of twin pairs were used to investigate associations between neighborhood walkability and objectively measured physical activity (PA) levels. Due to dramatic cellular epigenetic sex differences, male and female MZ twin pairs were analyzed separately to identify differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs). A priori comparisons were made on MZ twin pairs discordant on body mass index (BMI), PA levels, and neighborhood walkability. In addition to direct comparative analysis to identify specific DMRs, a weighted genome coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify DNA methylation sites associated with the physiological traits of interest. The pairs discordant in PA levels had epigenetic alterations that correlated with reduced metabolic parameters (i.e., BMI and waist circumference). The DNA methylation sites are associated with over fifty genes previously found to be specific to vigorous PA, metabolic risk factors, and sex. Combined observations demonstrate that behavioral factors, such as physical activity, appear to promote systemic epigenetic alterations that impact metabolic risk factors. The epigenetic DNA methylation sites and associated genes identified provide insight into PA impacts on metabolic parameters and the etiology of obesity.",

    "abstract": "An association between blood pressure and aortic stiffness is well known, but ambiguity remains as to whether one precedes the other. This study aimed to investigate the association of aortic stiffness with contemporaneous versus historic blood pressure and direction of causality between aortic stiffening and hypertension in female twins.\nAortic stiffness, measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was recorded in 2037 female TwinsUK participants (mean age: 62.4\u00b19.7 years) at a single time point. A subset of 947 participants had repeat PWV and MAP measures (mean interval 5.5\u00b11.7 years) with additional historic MAP (mean interval 6.6\u00b13.3 years before baseline).\nCross-sectional multivariable linear regression analysis confirmed PWV significantly associated with age and MAP. In longitudinal analysis, annual progression of PWV was not associated with historic MAP (standardized beta coefficient [\u03b2]=-0.02, \nProgression of aortic stiffness associates more strongly with contemporaneous MAP compared with historic MAP. In contrast, progression of MAP is associated with prior arterial stiffness. These findings suggest a bidirectional relationship between arterial stiffness and blood pressure, and that lowering blood pressure may prevent a cycle of arterial stiffening and hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is a rare and chronic neurological disease characterized by sudden sleep attacks, overwhelming daytime drowsiness, and cataplexy. When associated with a sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy) narcolepsy is classified as type 1, while the absence of cataplexy indicates type 2. Genetic, degenerative, and immunological hypotheses to explain the pathophysiology of NT1 are still a matter of debate. To contribute to the understanding of NT1 genetic basis, here we describe, for the first time, a whole genome analysis of a monozygotic twin pair discordant for NT1.\nWe present the case of a pair of 17-year-old male, monozygotic twins discordant for NT1. The affected twin had Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) of 20 (can range from 0 to 24), cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, polysomnography without abnormalities, multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) positive for narcolepsy, a mean sleep latency of 3\u00a0min, sleep-onset REM periods SOREMPs of 5, presence of allele HLA-DQB1*06:02, and Hypocretin-1 level of zero pg/mL (normal values are\u2009>\u2009200\u00a0pg/mL). The other twin had no narcolepsy symptoms (ESS of 4), normal polysomnography, MSLT without abnormalities, presence of allele HLA-DQB1*06:02, and Hypocretin-1 level of 396,74\u00a0pg/mL. To describe the genetic background for the NT1 discordant manifestations in this case, we present the whole-genome analysis of this monozygotic twin pair. The whole-genome comparison revealed that both twins have identical NT1 pathogenic mutations in known genes, such as HLA-DQB1*06:02:01, HLA-DRB1*11:01:02/*15:03:01. The affected twin has the expected clinical manifestation while the unaffected twin has an unexpected phenotype. The unaffected twin has significantly more frameshift mutations as compared to the affected twin (108 versus 75) and mutations that affect stop codons (61 versus 5 in stop gain, 26 versus 2 in start lost).\nThe differences observed in frameshift and stop codon mutations in the unaffected twin are consistent with loss-of-function effects and protective alleles, that are almost always associated with loss-of-function rare alleles. Also, overrepresentation analysis of genes containing variants with potential clinical relevance in the unaffected twin shows that most mutations are in genes related to immune regulation function, Golgi apparatus, MHC, and olfactory receptor. These observations support the hypothesis that NT1 has an immunological basis although protective mutations in non-HLA alleles might interfere with the expression of the NT1 phenotype and consequently, with the clinical manifestation of the disease.",

Regulation of such technologies as medical devices currently lacks behind their level of adoption. Digital Twins are the next evolution step of such DHTs and provide an opportunity to anticipate and act on ELSI before adoption again leaps before the necessary review. This paper introduces the concept and use cases of digital twins in medicine, then frames the debate through the lens of related technologies, machine learning and personalized medicine, and maps ethical challenges stemming from those. Finally, we lay out how digital twins may change and challenge the future practice of medicine.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity is a cornerstone of chronic disease prevention and treatment, yet most US adults do not perform levels recommended for health. The neighborhood-built environment (BE) may support or hinder physical activity levels. This study investigated whether identical twins who reside in more walkable BEs have greater activity levels than twins who reside in less walkable BEs (between-twin analysis), and whether associations remain significant when controlling for genetic and shared environmental factors (within-twin analysis).\nA cross-sectional study.\nThe Puget Sound region around Seattle, Washington, USA.\nThe sample consisted of 112 identical twin pairs who completed an in-person assessment and 2-week at-home measurement protocol using a global positioning system (GPS)monitor and accelerometer.\nThe walkability of each participants' place of residence was calculated using three BE dimensions (intersection density, population density and destination accessibility). For each variable, z scores were calculated and summed to produce the final walkability score.\nObjectively measured bouts of walking and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), expressed as minutes per week.\nWalkability was associated with walking bouts (but not MVPA) within the neighbourhood, both between (b=0.58, SE=0.13, p<0.001) and within pairs (b=0.61, SE=0.18, p=0.001). For a pair with a 2-unit difference in walkability, the twin in a more walkable neighbourhood is likely to walk approximately 16\u2009min per week more than the co-twin who lives in a less walkable neighbourhood.\nThis study provides robust evidence of an association between walkability and objective walking bouts. Improvements to the neighbourhood BE could potentially lead to increased activity levels in communities throughout the USA.",

    "abstract": "Developments in artificial intelligence, particularly convolutional neural networks and deep learning, have the potential for problem solving that has previously confounded human intelligence. Accurate prediction of radiation dosimetry pre-treatment with scope to adjust dosing for optimal target and non-target tissue doses is consistent with striving for improved the outcomes of precision medicine. The combination of artificial intelligence and production of digital twins could provide an avenue for an individualised therapy doses and enhanced outcomes in theranostics. While there are barriers to overcome, the maturity of individual technologies (i.e. radiation dosimetry, artificial intelligence, theranostics and digital twins) places these approaches within reach.",

    "abstract": "Fully effective intrapartum cardiotocographic (CTG) fetal heart monitoring is still missing. Visual analysis is far from credibility. Additional, computerized analysis techniques were proposed however they did not substantially decrease possible risks of fetal asphyxia. In twin pregnancies the problem is even more complicated. Our goal is to find the most valuable parameters in intrapartum CTG surveillance in twins, based on actual FIGO criteria.\nStudy included 58 women in labor who had been admitted to Delivery Department of tertiary care hospital with twin pregnancy in a period of one year. The features of the CTG (e.g., baseline, oscillation, decelerations, brady- or tachycardia) were grouped to create three variables that were closest to the FIGO CTG scale. All three groups were compared according to neonatal status (Apgar score at 5 min \u2265 7 or < 7; pH value in umbilical artery \u2265 7.20, < 7.20 or < 7.10 and BE (base excess) > or \u2264 -12). Fetal status and its acid - base equilibrium was compared either with long term variability (LTV), short term variability (STV), or percentage of the signal loss.\nOut of 58 twin pregnancies, a total of 116 babies were born. One baby was born dead. From this group, 11 deliveries were natural births and 47 deliveries were C-sections. None of the analyzed features (pH, BE, Apgar, CTG features except tracing length, CTG FIGO categories) were statistically different between groups of singleton and twin pregnancies, except percentage of C-sections. No differences were found either for STV or LTV and fetal status.org CTG categories.\nPrior to cardiotocographic tracing of twins during labor, ultrasound examination should be mandatory. Considerable loss of signal in CTG tracing in twins should provoke ultrasonographic confirmation of the fetal status.",

    "abstract": "A digital twin is a virtual model developed to accurately reflect a physical thing or a system. In radiology, a digital twin of a radiological device enables developers to test its characteristics, make alterations to the design or materials, and test the success or failure of the modifications in a virtual environment. Innovative technologies, such as AI and -omics sciences, may build virtual models for patients that are continuously adjustable based on live-tracked health/lifestyle parameters. Accordingly, healthcare could use digital twins to improve personalized medicine. Furthermore, the accumulation of digital twin models from real-world deployments will enable large cohorts of digital patients that may be used for virtual clinical trials and population studies. Through their further refinement, development, and application into clinical practice, digital twins could be crucial in the era of personalized medicine, revolutionizing how diseases are detected and managed. Although significant challenges remain in the development of digital twins, a structural modification to the current operating models is occurring, and radiologists can guide the introduction of such technology into healthcare.",

    "abstract": "While twin gestations are at increased risk of severe maternal morbidity (SMM), there is limited information about timing and causes of SMM in twins. Furthermore, existing data rely on screening definitions of SMM because a gold standard approach requires chart review. We sought to determine the timing and cause of SMM in twins using a gold standard definition outlined by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).\nWe used a perinatal database to identify all twin deliveries from 1998 to 2013 at a single academic medical center (\nA total of 165 (7%) of twin deliveries screened positive for SMM. After chart review of all screen-positive cases, 2.4% (\nCommonly used approaches to screen for SMM perform poorly in twins. This has important implications for quality initiatives and epidemiologic studies that rely on screening definitions of maternal morbidity. Our study demonstrates that the immediate postpartum period is a critical time for maternal health among women with twin pregnancies.\n\u00b7 Screening approaches for SMM have low positive predictive value in twins.. \u00b7 Hemorrhage, hypertensive, and pulmonary complications were the most common morbidities.. \u00b7 SMM was most common postpartum..",

    "abstract": "Twins account for approximately 1 in 30 live births in the United States. However, there are limited clinical experience studies published in noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for detecting aneuploidies in twins. This study reports the performance of an SNP-based NIPT in the largest cohort with known outcomes for high-risk aneuploidy results.\nThis is a retrospective analysis of 18,984 results from commercial single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based NIPT tests performed in twins between October 2, 2017 and December 31, 2019. Follow-up for all 211 high-risk cases was solicited.\nFollow-up outcomes were obtained in 105 cases. Positive predictive values (PPVs) for high-risk results were 88.7% (63/71, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 79.0%-95.0%) for trisomy 21% and 72.7% (8/11, 95% CI: 39.0%-94.0%) for trisomy 18. The results were stratified into monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ). The PPVs in MZ were 100% for both trisomy 21 (4/4, 95% CI: 40%-100%) and trisomy 18 (1/1, 95% CI: 2.5%-100%). No trisomy 13 cases were detected in the MZ group. The PPVs\u00a0in DZ were 88.1% (59/67, 95% CI: 77.8%-94.7%), 70.0% (7/10, 95% CI: 34.8%-93.3%), and 66.7% (2/3, 95% CI: 9.4%-99.2%) for trisomy 21, trisomy 18, and trisomy 13, respectively.\nThe performance of SNP-based NIPT in this large twin cohort was comparable to previously reported twin NIPT studies.

    "abstract": "We aim to contribute to the literature reporting tests of selection in utero. The theory of reproductive suppression predicts that natural selection would conserve mechanisms, referred to collectively as selection in utero, that spontaneously abort fetuses unlikely to thrive as infants in the prevailing environment. Tests of this prediction include reports that women give birth to fewer than expected male twins, historically among the frailest of infants, during stressful times. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in Spring 2020 demonstrably stressed the population. We test the hypothesis that conception cohorts in gestation at the onset of the pandemic in the United States yielded fewer than expected live male twin births.\nWe retrieved deidentified data on the universe of live births in the United States from the National Center for Health Statistics birth certificate records. We applied Box-Jenkins time-series methods to the twin secondary sex ratio computed for 77 monthly conception cohorts spanning August 2013 to December 2019 to detect outlying cohorts in gestation at the onset of the pandemic.\nThe twin secondary sex ratio fell below expected values in three conception cohorts (i.e., July, September, and October 2019, all p\u00a0<\u2009.05) exposed in utero to the onset of the pandemic.\nOur results add to prior findings consistent with selection in utero. The role of selection in utero in shaping the characteristics of live births cohorts, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, warrants further scrutiny.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic liver disease caused by a dysfunctional immune system. It is widely believed that autoimmune hepatitis accumulates in families. We found that autoimmune hepatitis does accumulate in monozygotic twins.\nWe present middle-aged monozygotic female twins developing autoimmune hepatitis consecutively within two years. Both twins had developed Graves' disease and were treated with carbimazole before the onset of autoimmune hepatitis. Both were cigarette smokers. The twins were treated with budesonide and azathioprine, which normalised liver parameters.\nThis case report supports the hypothesis that a genetic factor might be of great importance in the aetiology of autoimmune hepatitis.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are described as having been physically fused during pregnancy and delivery. They were first mentioned a long time ago when there was not much known about this. They share some organs that are vital for survival, like the heart; these twins are almost impossible to save, but there are some cases wherein there is evidence of their survival. The article aims to present a unique discussion on conjoined twins. This article talks about the formation of conjoint twins, their types and nomenclatures, embryological concepts, past history/traditional tales, case studies, and the medical enhancements happening in this area.\u00a0Both fission and fusion are thought to contribute to the disease. A monozygotic twin pregnancy cleaves when it occurs more than thirteen days after fertilization. There is just one placenta and one womb for conjoined twins (one amniotic sac).\u00a0The twins that are born and stay alive after delivery usually stay alive for a few days or weeks. It's pretty rare for them to live a long prosperous life, but this article shows the otherwise, too, like the Siamese twins, which is a unique example of conjoint twins who lived for a long time. This kind of pregnancy is a complex procedure that needs to be managed by a team of professionals.",

    "abstract": "Humans are simultaneously exposed to phenols and phthalates (PAEs). However, the mixture effect of phenols and PAEs on the body size of twins is lacking. From 2016 to 2018, we recruited 228 pregnant twins and collected up to three urine samples. A total of 8 PAE metabolites and 7 phenols were detected in urine by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Chemical individual and mixture effects were estimated. Multivariable linear regression results presented the percentage change in twins' growth differences at one month old with maternal PAE and phenol exposure. These chemicals were positively associated with weight differences during the entire trimester. Moreover, the quantile g-computed model showed that increased urinary concentrations of all chemicals by one quartile were associated with a 22.85% (95%CI: 11.21-35.72%), 22.60% (95%CI: 12.31-33.83%), and 24.05% (95%CI: 13.11-36.05%) larger weight difference within twins in each trimester, respectively. Increasing all PAE metabolites and phenols by one quantile across the entire trimester, weight differences increased by 26.61% (95% CI: 15.79%, 38.44%), and height differences increased by 15.84% (95%CI: 3.92%, 29.13%). Co-exposure to PAEs and phenols may primarily play a role in twins' growth.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins capacitate the industry 4.0 paradigm by predicting and optimizing the performance of physical assets of interest, mirroring a realistic in-silico representation of their functional behaviour. Although advanced digital twins set forth disrupting opportunities by delineating the in-service product and the related process dynamic performance, they have yet to be adopted by the pharma sector. The latter, currently struggles more than ever before to improve solubility of BCS II i.e., hard-to-dissolve active pharmaceutical ingredients by micronization and subsequent stabilization. Herein we construct and functionally validate the first artificially intelligent digital twin thread, capable of describing the course of manufacturing of such solidified nanosuspensions given a defined lifecycle starting point and predict and optimize the relevant process outcomes. To this end, we referenced experimental data as the sampling source, which we then augmented via pattern recognition utilizing neural network propagations. The zeta-dynamic potential metrics of the nanosuspensions were correlated to the interfacial Gibbs energy, while the density and heat capacity of the material system was calculated via the Saft-\u03b3-Mie statistical fluid theory. The curated data was then fused to physical and empirical laws to choose the appropriate theory and numeric description, respectively, before being polished by tuning the critical parameters to achieve the best fit with reality.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To report the clinical and radiographic findings and molecular etiology of the first monozygotic twins affected with Pfeiffer syndrome. Methods: Clinical and radiographic examination and whole exome sequencing were performed on two monozygotic twins with Pfeiffer syndrome. Results: An acceptor splice site mutation in FGFR2 (c.940-2A>G) was detected in both twins. The father and both twins shared the same haplotype, indicating that the mutant allele was from their father\u2019s chromosome who suffered severe upper airway obstruction and subsequent obstructive sleep apnea. Hypertrophy of nasal turbinates appears to be a newly recognized finding of Pfeiffer syndrome. Increased intracranial pressure in both twins were corrected early by fronto-orbital advancement with skull expansion and open osteotomy, in order to prevent the more severe consequences of increased intracranial pressure, including hydrocephalus, the bulging of the anterior fontanelle, and the diastasis of suture. Conclusions: Both twins carried a FGFR2 mutation and were discordant for lambdoid synostosis. Midface hypoplasia, narrow nasal cavities, and hypertrophic nasal turbinates resulted in severe upper airway obstruction and subsequent obstructive sleep apnea in both twins. Hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates appears to be a newly recognized finding of Pfeiffer syndrome. Fronto-orbital advancement with skull expansion and open osteotomy was performed to treat increased intracranial pressure in both twins. This is the first report of monozygotic twins with Pfeiffer syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins represent a rare type of monoamniotic twins. Ultrasound assessment during the first trimester can facilitate the diagnosis, however further assessment by colour Doppler studies, 3D imaging, fetal echocardiography and fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually required in order to determine the specific fetal abnormalities and to guide appropriate pregnancy management. This case report presents a rare case of conjoined twins complicating a dichorionic-diamniotic triplet pregnancy, achieved after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and blastocyst transfer. A 44-year-old woman was referred for chorionicity determination to our Fetal Medicine Centre due to suspicion of conjoined twins in a triplet pregnancy. Ultrasound assessment at 11 weeks demonstrated a dichorionic triplet pregnancy which was also complicated by a rare type of conjoined twins (thoracoomphalopagus) and after a successful embryo reduction a neonate of 2200 g was delivered by caesarean section at term. The accurate diagnosis and early detection of conjoined twins by a fetal medicine specialist is crucial, especially as far as multiple pregnancies with three or more fetuses are concerned.",

    "abstract": "Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction, often elevated myocardial enzymes, and electrocardiographic changes. Previous studies suggested that an overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system might cause TTS. However, the pathogenesis of TTS is largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated physiological stress reactivity with a standardized stress test in monozygotic twin sisters, only one of whom had experienced TTS.\nThe 60-year-old Caucasian monozygotic twins, one with and one without a previous episode of TTS, were recruited in the Department of Cardiology at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. We applied the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) to investigate stress reactivity six weeks after the TTS. Hemodynamic measures (heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP)), heart rate variability (HRV), plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine and salivary cortisol levels were collected immediately before and after the TSST, and 15, 45, and 90 min after TSST. The monozygotic twins differed in their hemodynamic stress response with the TTS twin showing blunted HR and BP reactivity and vagal withdrawal beyond the acute phase of stress. In contrast, the TTS twin showed a higher catecholamine and cortisol stress response with a steady increase in norepinephrine during the recovery period from stress compared to her non-TTS twin sister.\nLarge studies applying a case-control design are needed to confirm blunted hemodynamic reactivity, increased catecholamine reactivity, vagal withdrawal, and increased cortisol reactivity to stress in TTS. This may advance the knowledge of psychophysiological mechanisms in TTS.",

The mean age was 16.78 \u00b1 12.35 years for monozygotic twins and 14.30 \u00b1 8 years for dizygotic. Interpair and intrapair correlations between twins were calculated. In the groups of monozygotic and dizygotic twins, Ad-SoS correlated significantly with age (r = 0.56\u22120.73, p < 0.05), weight (r = 0.73\u22120.78, p < 0.05), and height (r = 0.80\u22120.81, p < 0.05). The strongest intrapair correlation (r = 0.99\u22120.998) was noted in monozygotic females for Ad-SoS, weight, and height. There was a statistically significant correlation between the intrapair difference of Ad-SoS and age but only in the groups of monozygotic and dizygotic females (r = 0.281, r2 = 0.079, and p = 0.028; r = 0.544, r2 = 0.296, and p = 0.01, respectively). After age adjustment, it was estimated that 28.62% of Ad-SoS in women and 13.2% of Ad-SoS in men was explained by genetic influence, leading to the conclusion that Ad-SoS changed with age, weight, and height. The strongest correlation between pairs of twins was observed in monozygotic twins. The differences in bone values between female twins arose with age, which indicated the role of environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "This case reports peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptomic changes in a pair of male monozygotic pediatric twins with metabolic syndrome (MetS) undertaking assisted weight loss. These 14-year-old boys presented with similar baseline biochemistry and body composition. After a 16-week weight-loss intervention, percent body weight loss was similar (Twin A 12%, and Twin B 13%). MetS resolved in Twin A but Twin B maintained elevated triglycerides after weight loss. Analysis of the PBMC transcriptome before and after weight loss revealed very different changes in gene expression including differences in the direction of expression of genes related to immune cell activation. 48.7% of genes that were downregulated in Twin A were upregulated in Twin B. This case highlights a novel approach to report the influence of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic dysfunction on the PBMC transcriptome. It explores whether expression of genes related to immune functions may underlie the differences in response to weight loss or whether transcriptomic alterations in immune cells may precede more traditional biomarkers of chronic pro-inflammation. These monozygotic twins present an example of divergence of phenotypic outcomes despite identical genetic background and similar treatment response.",

    "abstract": "We are rapidly approaching a future in which cancer patient digital twins will reach their potential to predict cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in individual patients. This will be realized based on advances in high performance computing, computational modeling, and an expanding repertoire of observational data across multiple scales and modalities. In 2020, the US National Cancer Institute, and the US Department of Energy, through a trans-disciplinary research community at the intersection of advanced computing and cancer research, initiated team science collaborative projects to explore the development and implementation of predictive Cancer Patient Digital Twins. Several diverse pilot projects were launched to provide key insights into important features of this emerging landscape and to determine the requirements for the development and adoption of cancer patient digital twins. Projects included exploring approaches to using a large cohort of digital twins to perform deep phenotyping and plan treatments at the individual level, prototyping self-learning digital twin platforms, using adaptive digital twin approaches to monitor treatment response and resistance, developing methods to integrate and fuse data and observations across multiple scales, and personalizing treatment based on cancer type. Collectively these efforts have yielded increased insights into the opportunities and challenges facing cancer patient digital twin approaches and helped define a path forward. Given the rapidly growing interest in patient digital twins, this manuscript provides a valuable early progress report of several CPDT pilot projects commenced in common, their overall aims, early progress, lessons learned and future directions that will increasingly involve the broader research community.",

    "abstract": "Early-onset isolated (DYT1) dystonia is one of the most common forms of primary dystonia in childhood, and deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus (GPi-DBS) is a highly effective treatment for it. However, the effectiveness of GPi-DBS in monozygotic twins with DYT1 dystonia has never been reported globally. Here, we report the cases of monozygotic twins with DYT1 dystonia who were treated using GPi-DBS, and we include a literature review. The younger brother showed an abnormal gait, with external rotation of the right lower leg at 6 years old. The symptoms gradually became so severe that he had difficulty walking on his own at 9 years of age. Treatment with levodopa-carbidopa partially resolved his symptoms, but most of the symptoms remained. Meanwhile, the older brother developed dystonia in both upper limbs at 8 years of age, with gradual symptom progression. At 13 years of age, they were diagnosed with DYT1 dystonia. Bilateral GPi-DBS was performed in both patients at 16 years of age. Their symptoms remarkably improved after surgery. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia rating scale (BFMDRS) movement score was reduced from 52 to 2 points for the younger brother and from 35 to 1 point for the older brother. Even if monozygotic twins have the same genes, the onset and severity of symptoms might vary in accordance with differences in epigenomic profiles. However, GPi-DBS treatment was very effective for the two cases; thus, we should consider the surgical interventions for each patient.",

    "abstract": "While reports of twin pairs concordant for insanity began to appear in the 19th century, the first modern psychiatric twin study that fulfilled Galton's 1875 promise of the value of the twin method was published by the German Psychiatrist and Geneticist Hans Luxenburger in 1928. Luxenburger introduced four major methodological advances: the use of representative sampling, proband-wise concordance, rigorous zygosity diagnoses, and age correction. He used a narrow Kraepelinian diagnostic approach diagnosis and ascertained twins hospitalized, on a specific day, in all large Bavarian asylums. We include a brief biography of Luxenburger, summarize the findings of his paper and provide a full English translation in the appendix. Luxenburger presents evidence that the frequency of twinning in those with severe mental illness were as expected and reports proband-wise concordance for probable and definite dementia praecox (MZ-76%, DZ-0%) and manic-depressive insanity (MZ-75%, DZ-0%). He also examined eccentricity and hyperthymic or hypothymic personality in the dementia praecox and manic-depressive pairs, respectively. Luxenburger's substantial contributions to the history of psychiatric genetics should be considered in the context of his intimate but ambivalent relationship with the racial-hygiene policy of the German National Socialists.",

    "abstract": "The influence of the host genome on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility and severity is supported by reports on monozygotic (MZ) twins where both were infected simultaneously with similar disease outcomes, including several who died due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection within days apart. However, successive exposures to pathogens throughout life along with other environmental factors make the immune response unique for each individual, even among MZ twins.\nHere we report a case of a young adult monozygotic twin pair, who caught attention since both presented simultaneously severe COVID-19 with the need for oxygen support despite age and good health conditions. One of the twins, who spent more time hospitalized, reported symptoms of long-COVID even 7 months after infection. Immune cell profile and specific responses to SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated as well as whole exome sequencing.\nAlthough the MZ twin brothers shared the same genetic mutations which may be associated with their increased risk of developing severe COVID-19, their clinical progression was different, reinforcing the role of both immune response and genetics in the COVID-19 presentation and course. Besides, post-COVID syndrome was observed in one of them, corroborating an association between the duration of hospitalization and the occurrence of long-COVID symptoms.",

    "abstract": "This study explored the effect of fetoscopic laser surgery on the placental structure and birth-weight discordance of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS).\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted in TTTS patients who were admitted to the Peking University Third Hospital between April 2014 and April 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: laser group and control group. Placentas with twin survival were injected, and pregnancy outcomes and placental characteristics of the two groups were compared. The correlation between the birth-weight discordance and placental characteristics in each group was analyzed.\nThe gestational age at first diagnosis in the laser group was significantly smaller than that in the control group (21.6 \u00b1 2.8 weeks vs. 27.7 \u00b1 3.0 weeks, \nThe birth-weight discordance is positively correlated with placental territory discordance in TTTS patients after FLS.",

    "abstract": "Linked deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) hypermethylation investigations of promoter methylation levels of candidate genes may help to increase the progressiveness and mortality rates of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), which is a unique myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm caused by excessive monocyte and granulocyte proliferation in infancy/early childhood. However, the roles of hypermethylation in this malignant disease are uncertain.\nBone marrow samples from a JMML patient and peripheral blood samples from a healthy monozygotic twin and an unrelated healthy donor were collected with the informed consent of the participant's parents. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was then performed. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to analyze specific differentially methylated region (DMG) related genes. The target genes were screened with Cytoscape and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING), which are gene/protein interaction databases. A data mining platform was used to examine the expression level data of the healthy control and JMML patient tissues in Gene Expression Omnibus data sets, and a survival analysis was performed for all the JMML patients.\nThe STRING analysis revealed that the red node [i.e., the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (",

    "abstract": "Twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence is an extremely rare congenital anomaly in monochorionic (MC) twins. The condition is characterized by a malformed fetus (acardiac twin) without cardiac activities being perfused by a structurally normal one (pump twin) \nWe described the first case of TRAP to receive laser surgery in Vietnam. The 26-wk pregnancy was originally misdiagnosed in another hospital as MC twins with single intrauterine fetal death. Following admission to our center, the diagnosis was amended to a 26-wk TRAP sequence stage IIb. The acardiac twin was 7.5 cm at the longest length, the ratio of the weight of the acardiac twin to the weight of the pump twin was more than 90%, the pump twin showed fetal distress with absent diastolic flow in umbilical artery of pump twin, and the peak systolic velocity in the middle cerebral artery = 1.6 MoM. We performed emergency laser photocoagulation of the acardiac twin's umbilical cord. After surgery, we successfully maintained the pregnancy for 8 wk and ended it electively by cesarean section at 34 wk of gestation due to rupture of membranes.\nTRAP should be appropriately diagnosed and treated early to avoid complications of the pump twin. Fetoscopic laser photocoagulation is a new and effective treatment for this condition.",

    "abstract": "The lifespan of humans varies greatly between individuals. Here, we aimed to explore what biological roles miRNAs may have on old age mortality-variation. Circulating miRNAs were measured in plasma from 43 monozygotic twin pairs (73-95\u00a0years of age) and mortality analyses were applied using Cox regression survival analyses and linear regression analyses of lifespan. In general, nominally significant miRNAs were mainly upregulated with shorter lifespan, both in Cox analysis (72\u00a0% upregulated) and in linear regression analysis (81\u00a0% upregulated). A total of 29 miRNAs were associated to mortality at a nominal significance level (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the survival analysis, but no miRNAs passed the FDR adjusted level of significance. Seven of the 29 miRNAs; hsa-miR-140-3p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-487b-3p, hsa-miR-19a-3p, hsa-let-7d-5p, hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-375, were nominally significant across two linear twin-paired analyses and the cox analysis. Pathway analyses of the 29 nominally significant miRNAs from the individual level analyses resulted in two nominally significant associated Reactome pathways (unadjusted p\u00a0<\u00a00.05); 'Negative regulation of FGFR signaling' and 'Neurotransmitter receptor binding and downstream transmission in the postsynaptic cell', and two significantly associated KEGG pathways; 'Linoleic acid metabolism' and 'Toxoplasmosis'. Additional pathway analyses and results of previous studies support that miRNAs linked to mortality at age 70\u00a0years or older play a role in lipid metabolism, tissues maintenance and morphology.",

    "abstract": "Congenital anterior urethral diverticulum (CAUD) is an uncommon abnormality of the male urethra. In the literature, cases of CAUD affecting both children within a set of identical twins or presenting concomitantly with another urethral condition are exceedingly rare. We describe 2 cases of CAUD in identical twins: a pair of newborns in which Twin 1A and Twin 1B both present with CAUD, and a second pair of newborns in which only Twin 2A presents with CAUD along with a partial collateral urethral duplication. In doing so, we aim to add to the incomplete literature on the embryological development of CAUD.",

We examined whether BMI-related DNA methylation (DNAm) variation would mediate the association of BMI with serum uric acid (SUA). We first conducted an epigenome-wide association analysis (EWAS) in 64 monozygotic twin pairs to detect BMI-related DNAm variation and then evaluated the mediated effect of DNAm using mediation analysis.

    "abstract": "Aberrant DNA methylation constitutes a key feature of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia at diagnosis, however its role as a predisposing or early contributor to leukemia development remains unknown. Here, we evaluate DNA methylation at birth in 41 leukemia-discordant monozygotic twin pairs using the Illumina EPIC array on archived neonatal blood spots to identify epigenetic variation associated with development of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, independent of genetic influence. Through conditional logistic regression we identify 240 significant probes and 10 regions associated with the discordant onset of leukemia. We identify a significant negative coefficient bias, indicating DNA hypomethylation in cases, across the array and enhanced in open sea, shelf/shore, and gene body regions compared to promoter and CpG island regions. Here, we show an association between global DNA hypomethylation and future development of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia across disease-discordant genetically identical twins, implying DNA hypomethylation may contribute more generally to leukemia risk.",

    "abstract": "The visibility available to an equipment operator on a dynamic construction site can often be blocked by various obstacles such as materials, temporary or permanent facilities, other equipment, and workers. Equipment monitoring in real-time digital twins can thus play a crucial role in accident prevention. This paper develops a scalable technical approach and presents a prototype application framework for transmitting real world sensor data to update 3D equipment models inside a graphical digital twin for concurrent visualization of a monitored construction operation. The developed framework and workflow can be extended to visualize any construction operation, as it occurs, inside a dynamic 3D world simply by outfitting the real equipment with appropriate sensors and connecting them to their virtual counterparts. The implemented proof-of-concept interface is described in the context of a real-time 3D digital twin for assisting excavator operators prevent unintended strikes with underground utilities. Experiments to validate the proposed technical approach by simulating the real-time motion of a backhoe loader's articulated arm using orientation sensors installed on its boom, stick, and bucket are described. The experimental results characterize the scope and potential reasons for spatio-temporal discrepancies that can occur between a monitored real operation and its replicated digital twin. The effect of an operator warning mechanism based on preset safety thresholds is also investigated and described.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have suggested the role of multiple genetic and environmental factors in the development of non-neoplastic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases; however, little information is available on these factors in the Korean population. Therefore, this cross-sectional study explored the effect of these factors by analyzing the concordance of several benign GI disorders in 525 monozygotic twins compared to that in 122 dizygotic twins aged >20 years from the Healthy Twin Study data of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (2005-2014). Chi-square test, Wilcoxon rank-sum, and binomial and multinomial logistic regression models were used for statistical analysis. There was lack of concordance of gastric/duodenal ulcers and cholelithiasis/cholangitis between monozygotic twins compared to that in dizygotic twins, suggesting that environmental factors may mediate those concordant disease expressions in monozygotic twins. The concordance of intestinal polyps in monozygotic twins was 32% lower than that in dizygotic twins (",

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the success rate of trial of labor in monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies and the impact of delivery mode on neonatal outcomes.\nSearches were performed in MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from the inception of each database until April 2022.\nSelection criteria included observational studies analyzing the delivery mode among monochorionic diamniotic gestations.\nAll analyses were carried out using an intention-to-treat approach, evaluating women according to the delivery mode to which they were assigned in the original studies.\nSeventeen studies met the eligibility criteria and were suitable for qualitative and quantitative analysis. In total, 4116 women were analyzed. This meta-analysis showed that trial of labor in monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies resulted in vaginal delivery of both twins in 75.5% of cases (95% confidence interval, 69.1-80.9). Failure to deliver the second twin vaginally occurred in 3.8% of cases (95% confidence interval, 2.5-5.7). In addition, the neonatal outcomes were comparable among women with monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy undergoing different planned delivery modes. Neonatal death occurred in 3.7 per 1000 cases in the planned cesarean delivery group and in 1.6 per 1000 cases in the planned vaginal delivery group. Perinatal death was observed in 7.5 per 1000 cases in the planned cesarean delivery group and in 5.8 per 1000 cases in the planned vaginal delivery group. Umbilical artery pH <7.00 occurred in 0 per 1000 cases in the planned cesarean delivery and 4.6 per 1000 cases in the planned vaginal delivery group. Neonatal intensive care unit stay of >72 hours had a prevalence of 59.7 per 1000 cases in the planned cesarean delivery and 42.8 per 1000 cases in the planned vaginal delivery group.\nThis meta-analysis showed that trial of labor in monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies is successful in most cases and relatively safe, considering that neonatal and perinatal mortality and severe morbidity were comparable between the trial of labor and planned cesarean delivery groups. Therefore, the choice of planned delivery mode in twin gestations should not be made a priori.",

    "abstract": "Many theories in the social sciences assume that parenting affects child development. Previous research mostly supports the notion that parenting affects the skill development of children in early childhood. There are fewer studies testing whether parenting in early adolescence has such an influence. We estimate the effects of parenting on early adolescents' noncognitive skills using data from the German Twin Family Panel (TwinLife). Specifically, we look at the effects of parenting styles, parental activities, and extracurricular activities on the academic self-concept, motivation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and locus of control of 10 to 14 years old children. To control for unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality, we employ twin fixed-effects models combined with longitudinal information. In addition, MZ twin fixed effects models also control for genetic confounding. Our findings provide no support to the notion that parenting styles, parental activities, and extracurricular activities in early adolescence affect the development of children's noncognitive skills. We conclude that our results, in combination with the majority of evidence from previous research, are in line with a model according to which parenting has larger effects on the skill development of children in early childhood than in early adolescence.",

    "abstract": "In order to improve the library's ability of cross-platform information retrieval and data scheduling and distribution, a library cross-platform information retrieval system based on digital twin technology is designed. Using data warehouse decision support and data source structured query methods, the spectral characteristics of Library cross-platform information resources are extracted. Using the method of Hadoop data parallel loading, the library cross-platform operation data is divided into decision-making data, computing resource pool data, and Hadoop parallel loading data. A library cross-platform information digital twin parallel retrieval and information fusion feature matching model is established, and the retrieval channels are allocated through multiple complex and balanced task scheduling sequences. According to the queue configuration model of Library cross-platform information retrieval, the optimization design of Library cross-platform information retrieval system is realized. The simulation test results show that the designed system has good recall ability of cross-platform information retrieval data, and improves the utilization rate of cross-platform resources and the dynamic scheduling ability of online resources.",

    "abstract": "The differential impact of depression across different periods in life on mortality remains inconclusive. We aimed to examine the association of depression that occurs at different age with all-cause mortality, and to explore the roles of dementia, as well as genetic and early-life environmental factors, in this association.\nFrom the Swedish Twin Registry, 44,919 twin individuals were followed for up to 18 years. Depression was ascertained using the National Patient Registry and categorized as early-life (<45 years), midlife (45-64 years), and late-life (\u226565 years) depression according to the age of the first diagnosis. Deaths were identified through the Cause of Death Register. Generalized estimating equation, generalized structural equation, and conditional logistic regression were used for unmatched, mediation, and co-twin matched analyses, respectively.\nIn unmatched analyses, the multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of mortality were 1.71 (1.46-2.00) for depression at any age, 1.72 (1.36-2.17) for early-life, 1.51 (1.19-1.90) for midlife, and 4.10 (2.02-8.34) for late-life depression. Mortality was significantly higher in individuals with late-life depression than those with earlier-life depression (\nDepression is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, and dementia mediates approximately 60% of the impact of depression on mortality in late life. Genetic and early-life environmental factors may not play a significant role in the depression-mortality association.",

    "abstract": "Weight discordance is among the major determinants of perinatal outcome in twin pregnancies. Weight discordance can occur in each trimester of pregnancy, though the clinical meaning of such finding and the association with adverse perinatal outcome can vary according to the gestational age (GA) at detection of growth discrepancy. Discrepancy in fetal size in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of anomalies, aneuploidy, and fetal loss, though the predictive accuracy of using discordance to predict perinatal outcome is low. Conversely, discordance in the third trimester of pregnancy can be associated with fetal growth restriction, perinatal mortality, and morbidity. In view of these associations, twin pregnancies should be monitored for the occurrence of growth discrepancy. The present review aims to provide an up-to-date critical appraisal of the diagnosis and clinical management of twin pregnancies complicated by growth discordance according to the trimester at presentation.",

    "abstract": "To explore the differences in DNA methylation associated with age-related hearing loss in a study of 57 twin pairs from China.\nMonozygotic twins were identified through the Qingdao Twin Registration system. The median age of participants was\u00a0>\u00a050\u00a0years. Their hearing thresholds were measured using a multilevel pure-tone audiometry assessment. The pure-tone audiometry was calculated at low frequencies (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0\u00a0kHz), speech frequencies (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0\u00a0kHz), and high frequencies (4.0 and 8\u00a0kHz). The CpG sites were tested using a linear mixed-effects model, and the function of the cis-regulatory regions and ontological enrichments were predicted using the online Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool. The differentially methylated regions were identified using a comb-p python library approach.\nIn each of the PTA categories (low-, speech-, high-frequency), age-related hearing loss was detected in 25.9%, 19.3%, and 52.8% of participants. In the low-, speech- and high-frequency categories we identified 18, 42, and 12 individual CpG sites and 6, 11, and 6 differentially methylated regions. The CpG site located near DUSP4 had the strongest association with low- and speech-frequency, while the strongest association with high-frequency was near C21orf58. We identified associations of ALG10 with high-frequency hearing, C3 and LCK with low- and speech-frequency hearing, and GBX2 with low-frequency hearing. Top pathways that may be related to hearing, such as the Notch signaling pathway, were also identified.\nOur study is the first of its kind to identify these genes and their associated with DNA methylation may play essential roles in the hearing process. The results of our epigenome-wide association study on twins clarify the complex mechanisms underlying age-related hearing loss.",

    "abstract": "Classroom placement of twins is an ongoing issue for educational policy. Many educational jurisdictions have standard policy most commonly founded in the belief that separation supports individual identity, personal development and academic opportunity. This study examined the effects of classroom placement in a sample of 560 twin pairs whose behaviors were assessed from ages 5 to 12 years. We found no detrimental effect of classroom sharing on twins' social development. In contrast, this study provides evidence that educating twins together is associated with modest positive twins' behaviors and social functioning at school. Implications for educational policies are further discussed.",

Cephalothoracopagus is a rare type of conjoined twins, which is a rare monozygotic twinning resulting in imperfect fusion of the head, chest and upper abdomen. These twins have separated limbs and pelvis. The incidence of conjoined twins is 1 per 50,000 to 1 per 200,000 births. The cephalothoracopagus however is very rare variant seen in 1 in 3 million births. In literature approximately 200 cases have been reported till now. The cephalothoracopagus janiceps has two types: disymmetros and asymmetros. We present a case of cephalothoracopagus janiceps disymmetros in a 22-year-old gravida at 19 weeks gestation.",

    "abstract": "Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) play a vital role in the screening process for coeliac disease (CD). Levels above 30\u2009U/ml suggest a possible diagnosis of CD, prompting further investigation, usually by taking a duodenal biopsy. We report an unusual case of 39-year-old male twins, one presenting with iron deficiency anaemia and the other asymptomatic, with anti-tTG antibodies of >4,965.5\u2009U/ml, an extraordinary level. A duodenal biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of CD and following the adoption of a gluten-free diet, anti-tTG levels were found to decrease back to normal levels. This case demonstrates how CD can cause significant biochemical and histological pathology, but present with mild or no symptoms.",

    "abstract": "We explored the genetic and environmental inter-relationships among osteoporosis, fracture, arthritis, and bone mineral density concordance in monozygotic twins compared to those in dizygotic twins. This cross-sectional research assessed data of 1032 monozygotic and 242 dizygotic twin pairs aged >20 years included in the Healthy Twin Study data of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study between 2005 and 2014. Outcomes of interest included illness concordance and absolute differences in dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) T-scores. We found comparable concordances of osteoporosis, fractures, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis between monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Medical histories of osteoporosis, fractures caused by accident or falling, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis were not distinct between monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Accidental fracture occurrence in both monozygotic twins showed significantly lower odds than that in dizygotic twins. Genetic influence on liability to fracture risk might thus be maintained. DEXA T-scores for bone mineral density indicated more comparable tendencies within monozygotic twin pairs than within dizygotic ones, suggesting the relative importance of genetic contribution to bone mineral density. The relative importance of genetic factors in bone mineral density is sustained between monozygotic twins; overt disease expression of osteoporosis, fractures, or arthritis may be affected by environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a monogenic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Genotype\u2212phenotype relationships are complex, with variable penetrance even within the same family. The involvement of other modulating genetic and environmental factors is unknown. We aimed to analyze the HCM in monozygotic twins, carriers of the same founder pathogenic variant MYBPC3 p.G263*. The relationship was verified using the PowerPlex 16 HS System kit. Phenotypic differences and environmental differences (overloading conditions, coexistence and location, lifestyle, sport, and intensity) were analyzed. Three pairs of twins genetically identical for all markers and carriers of MYBPC3 G263* were identified. No environmental differences were identified. One of the 89-year-old twins had symptomatic severe obstructive HCM that required septal ablation, while her twin has remained asymptomatic with mild phenotype >80 years. A 49-year-old twin had a severe phenotype of obstructive HCM and pending myectomy, while his twin had a mild asymptomatic phenotype. In the last pair of twins, one presented a much larger left ventricular hypertrophy than his identical twin. In summary, we present three pairs of HCM twin patients sharing not only the genetic cause of the inherited disease but the entire genetic background. Despite identical genetic information and the absence of other known clinical, environmental, or lifestyle differences, the severity of the HCM phenotype is strikingly different. These unexplained differences should prompt the study of other unknown modulating factors, either epigenetic or environmental.",

    "abstract": "Fetal growth restriction contributes to the excess perinatal mortality and morbidity associated with twin pregnancies. Regular ultrasound monitoring for fetal growth restriction is an essential component of antenatal care of twin gestations. It is accepted that twins have divergent growth trajectories around 28-30 weeks' gestation and are born smaller compared to singletons. Despite this well-established difference in fetal growth, twin pregnancies have been traditionally managed using growth standards developed for singleton pregnancies. Numerous recent studies have demonstrated a strong case supporting the use of twin-specific growth standards, but clinical implementation has been lacking. In this paper, we will review the evidence on factors affecting fetal growth, the rationale for twin-specific reference charts, clinical evidence for their use, and future direction of research. Applying singleton growth standards to twin pregnancies inflates the abnormal growth rate, and recent clinical evidence from several studies suggests that they are too stringent for classification of twins. The association of adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes such as perinatal death, preterm birth, neonatal care unit admission, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and composite neonatal morbidity is stronger when classification is made using twin-specific standards compared to singletons.",

This retrospective cohort study was carried out on 36 identical (18 pairs) and 28 fraternal (14 pairs) twins in mixed dentition and 36 identical (18 pairs) and 38 fraternal (19 pairs) twins in permanent dentition stages on the basis of the availability of the dental casts scanned each year from each group (Table I). Linear measurements from dental casts were performed in patients aged 8-16 years.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to characterize a full-term conjoined twins' cadaver curated by Dr. Jacob Henle sometime between 1844 and 1852 and demonstrate digital distribution of an old and rare medical museum specimen using an extended reality (XR) model workflow.\nThe cadaver (Preparation 296) is in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology at the University of Heidelberg. An XR display workflow comprises image capture, segmentation, and visualization using CT/MR scans derived from the cadaver. Online radiology presentation to medical students focuses on diagnostic characteristics of anatomical systems depicted with XR models.\nDevelopmental defects in Preparation 296 include duplicated supradiaphragmatic structures and abnormal osteological features. Subdiaphragmatically, the gut is continuous on the right, but terminates at the distal esophagus on the left. One large liver occupies the abdomen with one spleen located on the left side. Observations suggest duplication of the primitive streak and separate notochords rostrally. Duplication occurs near the yolk sac and involves midgut formation while secondary midline fusion of the upper extremities and ribs likely results from the proximity of the embryos during development. Medical students access the model with device agnostic software during the curricular topic \"Human Body Plan\" that includes embryology concepts covering mechanisms of twinning.\nThe workflow enables ease-of-access XR visualizations of an old and rare museum specimen. This study also demonstrates digital distribution and utilization of XR models applicable to embryology education.",

Early-stage twinning growth and interactions are in focus herein for a magnesium single crystal at the nanometer length-scale. We demonstrate a basic methodology in order to determine the mobility parameter that steers the kinetics of phase-field propagation. The concept is to use already existing molecular dynamics simulations and analytical solutions in order to set the mobility parameter correctly. In this way, we exercise the model for gaining new insights into growth of twin morphologies, temporally-evolving spatial distribution of the shear stress field in the vicinity of the nanotwin, multi-twin, and twin-defect interactions. Overall, this research addresses gaps in our fundamental understanding of twin growth, while providing motivation for future discoveries in twin evolution and their effect on next-generation material performance and design.",

    "abstract": "Gender dysphoria affects 0.5% of people worldwide. Transgender men display a divergence between the female genetic sex and the gender male identity. To the best of our knowledge, we describe the first case report with regard to a transgender man with a dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy obtained by artificial insemination using donor sperm as a monoparental family, presenting early fetal growth restriction of both twins. The patient is a 35-year-old transgender man who had previously received gender-affirming hormone therapy based on testosterone for five years and had a prior bilateral mastectomy as gender-affirming surgery. Whether assisted reproductive techniques have any influence on obstetrical outcomes among these patients and whether prior long-term intake of gender-affirming hormone therapy has an impact on pregnancy and obstetrical outcomes remain to be elucidated.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to explore factors associated with adverse perinatal outcomes for second twins and to identify predictive factors for successful vaginal delivery of the second twin after vaginal delivery of the first twin.\nThis 10-year retrospective study included 231 cases of twin pregnancies in which vaginal delivery of the second twin was attempted after vaginal delivery of the first twin. The relationships of obstetric characteristics with the composite adverse perinatal outcome of the second twin were analysed. Predictive factors for successful vaginal delivery of the second twin were also explored.\nGestational age <32 weeks was the only independent risk factor for the composite adverse perinatal outcome and neonatal intensive care unit admission for the second twin. A longer inter-twin delivery interval was associated with greater risk of caesarean delivery of the second twin, but it did not increase the risk of an adverse perinatal outcome. Non-vertex presentation of the second twin at delivery was independently associated with caesarean delivery (9.0% vs 2.0%, P=0.03). For second twins in breech presentation, caesarean delivery was associated with the presence of less experienced birth attendants.\nAmong second twins born to mothers who had attempted vaginal delivery, adverse perinatal outcomes were mainly related to prematurity. The presence of more experienced birth attendants may contribute to successful vaginal delivery of the second twin, particularly for twins in non-vertex presentation.",

    "abstract": "A tragic car accident took place in one of the villages of southern Poland. Three teenagers were traveling by car - a woman and two men (identical twins). None of the participants had their seat belts fastened, and the men were under the influence of alcohol and drugs. As a result of losing control of the vehicle, the woman died instantly, but she was not the driver. The driver was one of the men, but neither pleaded guilty. The police and the prosecutor's office had to clearly identify the perpetrator and prove his guilt, which was possible based on the analysis of the collected microtraces.\u00a0The article describes the collected evidence and presents the results of microtraces analysis, on the basis of which the perpetrator of the accident was determined and convicted. In this particular case it was difficult because the suspects were identical twins and commonly used forensic examinations (such as forensic genetics, anthropology, dactyloscopy, traceology, osmology) did not bring a satisfactory result. Only the analysis of microtraces turned out to be groundbreaking.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the differences in amniotic fluid cardiac biomarkers and clinical features among types of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) abnormality in monochorionic (MC) twins.\nThis prospective study included MC twins that underwent laser surgery. Recipient or larger twins (group A) and donor or smaller twins (group B) were assessed and divided into those with a normal right ventricular outflow tract (normal RVOT), functional pulmonary atresia (fPA), or pulmonary stenosis (PS). Amniotic fluid levels of NT-proBNP (afNT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin T (afTnT) were examined during surgery.\nOf 190 fetuses in group A, there were 14 RVOT abnormality cases (including 7 fPA and 7 PS). No group B fetuses showed RVOT abnormality findings. In group A, later and earlier gestational age at surgery were observed in fPA (25.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8\u00a0weeks) and PS groups (17.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0weeks). All survived PS cases demonstrated progressive pulmonary valve obstruction, not observed in fPA groups. AfNT-proBNP were significantly higher in fPA and PS than in the normal RVOT group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). AfTnT was significantly higher in group A with PS than fPA and normal RVOT groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nAmong RVOT abnormality types in group A, amniotic fluid cardiac biomarkers were differently expressed, and clinical features were also differentiated. These findings provide insight into the pathophysiological influence on RVOT in MC twins.\nThis study was registered with the Japanese Clinical Trial Registry \"UMIN-CTR\" (http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index-j.htm; trial ID numbers UMIN000024486 and 000037702).",

    "abstract": "This paper suggests a methodology (conception and principles) for building two-mode monitoring systems (SMs) for industrial facilities and their adjacent territories based on the application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), Internet of Things (IoT), and digital twin (DT) technologies, and a set of SM reliability models considering the parameters of the channels and components. The concept of building a reliable and resilient SM is proposed. For this purpose, the von Neumann paradigm for the synthesis of reliable systems from unreliable components is developed. For complex SMs of industrial facilities, the concept covers the application of various types of redundancy (structural, version, time, and space) for basic components-sensors, means of communication, processing, and presentation-in the form of DTs for decision support systems. The research results include: the methodology for the building and general structures of UAV-, IoT-, and DT-based SMs in industrial facilities as multi-level systems; reliability models for SMs considering the applied technologies and operation modes (normal and emergency); and industrial cases of SMs for manufacture and nuclear power plants. The results obtained are the basis for further development of the theory and for practical applications of SMs in industrial facilities within the framework of the implementation and improvement of Industry 4.0 principles.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the coincidence of obesity and nutritional intake in monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins. The data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) from 2005 through 2014 were analyzed. Participants \u2265 20 years old were enrolled. The 1006 monozygotic twins and 238 dizygotic twins were analyzed for differences in self-reported nutritional intake, total body fat, and body mass index (BMI) using a linear regression model. The estimated values (EV) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the difference in dietary intake, total body fat, and BMI score were calculated. The monozygotic twin group and the dizygotic twin group showed similar differences in nutritional intake, DEXA fat, and BMI (all p > 0.05). The differences in nutritional intake of total calories and carbohydrates were lower in the monozygotic twin group than in the dizygotic twin group (all p < 0.05). The differences in total body fat were lower in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins (adjusted EV = 2427.86 g, 95% CI = 1777.19\u22123078.53 and adjusted EV = 1.90%, 95% CI = 1.33\u22122.46). Monozygotic twins had more similar dietary habits for total calories and carbohydrate intake. Other nutritional factors did not show differential similarity between monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Total body fat was more concordant in monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to investigate the changes in sustainable working life over 10-13 years of follow-up and the effect of baseline night work. Data from the Swedish national registers were used to define sustainable working life. Survey data in the 1998-2003 \"SALT\" with 34,680 twins or in the 2004-2006 \"STAGE\" with 19,637 twins were utilized to assess night work at baseline. Group-based trajectory and multinomial regression models were applied. The results of the SALT cohort yielded five trajectory solutions: stable sustainable working life (40%), stable lack of sustainable working life (25%), later decreasingly sustainable working life (15%), increasingly sustainable working life (14%), and early decreasingly sustainable working life (7%). In the STAGE cohort, four trajectories were detected: stable sustainable working life (83%), decreasingly sustainable working life (7%), stable lack of sustainable working life (5%), and increasing sustainable working life (5%). Night work was associated with the decreasing or increasing sustainable working life in the trajectory groups. To conclude, the largest parts of both cohorts followed trajectories of stable sustainable working lives. Night work was associated with both the trajectories of decreasing and increasing sustainable working lives.",

    "abstract": "Twins and late preterm (LPT) infants are at an increased risk of being breastfed to a lesser extent than term singletons. This study aimed to describe the initiation and duration of any and exclusive breastfeeding at the breast for mothers of LPT twins and term twins during the first 4 months and to explore the breastfeeding experiences of mothers of LPT twins.\nA sequential two-sample quantitative-qualitative explanatory mixed-methods design was used. The quantitative data were derived from a longitudinal cohort study in which 22 mothers of LPT twins and 41 mothers of term twins answered questionnaires at one and four months after birth (2015-2017). The qualitative data were obtained from semi-structured interviews with 14 mothers of LPT twins (2020-2021), based on results from the quantitative study and literature. Analysis included descriptive statistics of quantitative data and deductive content analysis of the qualitative data, followed by condensation and synthesis.\nAll mothers of LPT twins (100%) and most mothers of term twins (96%) initiated breastfeeding. There was no difference in any breastfeeding during the first week at home (98% versus 95%) and at 1 month (88% versus 85%). However, at 4 months, the difference was significant (44% versus 75%). The qualitative data highlighted that mothers of LPT twins experienced breastfeeding as complex and strenuous. Key factors influencing mothers' experiences and decisions were their infants' immature breastfeeding behaviors requiring them to express breast milk alongside breastfeeding, the burden of following task-oriented feeding regimes, and the lack of guidance from healthcare professionals. As a result, mothers started to question the worth of their breastfeeding efforts, leading to changes in breastfeeding management with diverse results. Support from fathers and grandparents positively influenced sustained breastfeeding.\nMothers of LPT twins want to breastfeed, but they face many challenges in breastfeeding during the first month, leading to more LPT twins' mothers than term twins' mothers ceasing breastfeeding during the following months. To promote and safeguard breastfeeding in this vulnerable group, care must be differentiated from routine term infant services, and healthcare professionals need to receive proper education and training.",

    "abstract": "The elevated frequency of discordance for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) phenotype between monozygotic twins suggests the involvement of non-mendelian mechanisms. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of epigenetics in CH pathogenesis.\nA genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed on the peripheral blood of 23 twin pairs (10 monozygotic and 13 dizygotic), 4 concordant and 19 discordant pairs for CH at birth.\nDifferential methylation analysis did not show significant differences in methylation levels between CH cases and controls, but a different methylation status of several genes may explain the CH discordance of a monozygotic twin couple carrying a monoallelic nonsense mutation of DUOX2. In addition, the median number of hypo-methylated Stochastic Epigenetic Mutations (SEMs) resulted significantly increased in cases compared to controls. The prioritization analysis for CH performed on the genes epimutated exclusively in the cases identified SLC26A4, FOXI1, NKX2-5 and TSHB as the genes with the highest score. The analysis of significantly SEMs-enriched regions led to the identification of two genes (FAM50B and MEG8) that resulted epigenetically dysregulated in cases.\nEpigenetic modifications may potentially account for CH pathogenesis and explain discordance among monozygotic twins.",

    "results": "Differential methylation analysis did not show significant differences in methylation levels between CH cases and controls, but a different methylation status of several genes may explain the CH discordance of a monozygotic twin couple carrying a monoallelic nonsense mutation of DUOX2. In addition, the median number of hypo-methylated Stochastic Epigenetic Mutations (SEMs) resulted significantly increased in cases compared to controls. The prioritization analysis for CH performed on the genes epimutated exclusively in the cases identified SLC26A4, FOXI1, NKX2-5 and TSHB as the genes with the highest score. The analysis of significantly SEMs-enriched regions led to the identification of two genes (FAM50B and MEG8) that resulted epigenetically dysregulated in cases.",

    "abstract": "The majority of studies are limited to adverse perinatal outcomes and poor cognitive abilities in the short term in discordant monochorionic twins.\nTo determine whether small and large discordant dizygotic twins differ in physical growth and intelligence development and weight and height from birth up to 6\u00a0years of age were measured in 34 dizygotic twin pairs with\u2009\u2265\u200920% birth weight discordance. Mental developmental index (MDI) and psychomotor developmental index (PDI) were calculated at 1\u00a0year, while the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV) full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) was assessed at the age of 6.\nThe difference in height and weight in each stage differed significantly from birth to 72-months-old (P\u2009<\u20090.05), although there was disappointing catch-up growth in smaller twins. PDI but not MDI at 1\u00a0year of age was significantly different between the two groups (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and smaller twins experienced higher psychomotor retardation rates (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Also, the influence of height and weight on PDI was statistically significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05). No significant difference was detected in the WISC-IV full-scale IQ at the age of 6; however, the full-scale IQ may be affected by the history of suffocation and the S/D value (P\u2009=\u20090.011, P\u2009=\u20090.022).\nIntrauterine fetal growth and development lead to birth weight differences in twins and sustain an impact on the children's physical growth in height and weight from birth to preschool age, causing psychomotor developmental differences at 1\u00a0year of age. However, the differences in psychomotor development decrease gradually by the age of 6.",

Results: We reporta case of a 31-year-old primigravida who was referred to the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at our hospital with a presumptive dia gnosis of conjoined twins. The ultrasound examination with subsequent three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction demonstrated twin gestation complicated by cephalothoracoomphalopagus. Observations demonstrated that the twins were joined over an area that extended from the head to the thoraces down to the central abdomen. In view of multiple congenital malformations incompatible with postnatal life, the pregnancy was terminated. The twins then underwent an autopsy at the Department of Pathology and the autopsy confi rmed previous diagnosis. Conclusion: Cephalothoracoomphalopagus is one of the rarest forms of conjoined twins with unknown incidence due to a very small number of documented cases.",

    "abstract": "Studying speech processing in twins versus their singleton peers provides opportunities to study both genetic and environmental effects on how children acquire these aspects of their speech and - by extension - their phonological systems. Our study focused on speech processing in typically developing Hungarian-speaking twins and their singleton peers between 5 and 9\u00a0years of age. Participants included 384 monolingual Hungarian-speaking children (192 twins, and 192 singletons). Data from four tasks - repetition of synthesised monosyllables, nonsense words, well-formed noisy sentences, and well-formed phonologically complex sentences - were analysed. There was a main effect for birth status, and singletons outperformed their twin peers on the majority of the speech processing tasks. Age and task also had effects on the performance of the participants, and there was a three-way task by age by twin versus singleton status indicating that the speech processing performance of twins versus singletons is interdependent with the type of task and age. Our results also indicate that monolingual Hungarian-speaking twins may be at higher risk for developmental speech delays relative to their singleton peers.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore clinical and molecular factors that cause discordance for clinical expression of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) in a pair of identical twins with the 14484 point mutation.\nTwin patients with the 14484 point mutation were studied for zygosity by using the Short Tandem Repeats Typing system. For the monozygotic twins, the radioactive restriction and densitometric analyses were used to quantitate the heteroplasmy level for the 14484 point mutation. The mitochondrial genome was analyzed to determine influential factors by mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and next generation sequencing. For the dizygotic twins, the nuclear DNA was analyzed. The twins with 14484 LHON were monozygotic with homoplasmy. No difference in the point mutation in mitochondrial DNA was found. No modifying genes that potentially influenced the disparity in phenotypic expression of LHON were detected in these twins.\nThis 11-year follow-up of monozygotic twins showed additional genetic modifications and epigenetic factors are possibly associated with discordance for LHON.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the relationship between estimated fetal weight discordance by ultrasonography and maternal and neonatal outcomes in dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies. We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of 106 twin pregnancies delivered at a single tertiary center between January 2011 and February 2020. At 20-24 and 28-32\u00a0weeks of gestation, participants were divided into two groups: discordant twins with an estimated fetal weight difference of more than 20% and concordant twins with a weight difference of less than 20%. Maternal complications and neonatal outcomes were compared between the two groups. Although the incidences of preeclampsia and placenta previa were significantly higher in discordant twins measured between 20 and 24\u00a0weeks, no statistical significance was found in neonatal outcomes. Delivery times were earlier, and neonatal weights were lower in discordant twins measured between 28 and 32\u00a0weeks. Neonatal outcomes such as ventilator use and neurodevelopment were also significantly different. Discordance in estimated fetal weight measured using ultrasonography between 20 and 24\u00a0weeks can be a risk factor for maternal preeclampsia and placenta previa, whereas discordance at 28-32\u00a0weeks may predict poor neonatal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Carbofuran is a pesticide widely used in agricultural context to kill insects, mites, and flies by ingestion or contact. Along with literature review, we aimed to (i) present the clinical, autopsy, and toxicological findings of carbofuran self-poisonings in two 69-year-old twins, resulting in the death of one of them and (ii) assess carbofuran metabolite distribution using molecular networking. Quantitative analysis of carbofuran and its main metabolites (3-hydroxycarbofuran and 3-ketocarbofuran) was carried out using an original liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method on biological samples (cardiac or peripheral blood, urine, bile, and gastric contents). Toxicological analysis of post-mortem samples (twin 1) highlighted high concentrations of carbofuran and its metabolites in cardiac blood, bile, and gastric contents. These compounds were also quantified in blood and/or urine samples of the living brother (twin 2), confirming poisoning. Using molecular networking approach to facilitate visualization of mass spectrometry datasets and sample-to-sample comparisons, we detected two more metabolites (7-phenol-carbofuran and 3-hydroxycarbofuran glucuronide) in bile (twin 1) and urine (twin 2). These results highlight the value of (i) these compounds as carbofuran consumption markers and (ii) bile samples in post-mortem analysis to confirm poisoning. From an analytical point of view, molecular networking allowed the detection and interpretation of carbofuran metabolite ammonium adducts which helped to confirm their identification annotations, as well as their structural data. From a clinical point of view, the different outcomes between the two brothers are discussed. Overall, these cases provide novel information regarding the distribution of carbofuran and its metabolites in poisoning context.",

    "abstract": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is common in the elderly and has been reported to associate with accelerated epigenetic age (AgeAccel), especially intrinsic (ie, cell-type independent) AgeAccel and to a lesser degree extrinsic AgeAccel, which reflects the immune-cell composition of the peripheral blood. We investigated the association between CHIP occurrence and AgeAccel in 154 Danish twin pairs aged 73-90 years (mean 79), using both individual-level and intrapair analyses, the latter to control for shared genetic and environmental factors. Of 308 individuals, 116 carried a CHIP mutation. CHIP carriers had non-significantly increased AgeAccel compared with non-carriers; the strongest association was for the Intrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (IEAA) estimator (CHIP carriers 1.4 years older, ",

    "abstract": "The development of conjoined twins always catches the eyes of researchers and clinicians. Beyond the rareness of the cases, how they develop is a debatable issue. This report presented a case of ischiopagus conjoined twins who had two heads (dicephalus), four upper extremities (tetrabrachius), and were joined below the chest with two lower extremities (bipus). The twin's mother was referred from a primary hospital to Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital for proper management of twin pregnancy, where a cesarean section was performed. The mother and her husband have no family history of birth defects or exposure to known teratogens. On imaging, the twins had separate hearts, lungs, and kidneys but a single liver, spleen, stomach, and intestine. They also shared genitourinary structures: a single penis with sub-coronal hypospadias and one imperforate anus. In addition, their placenta was single with one umbilical vein and two umbilical arteries. The conjoined twins had multiple accompanying cardiovascular anomalies but no external craniofacial, extremity, or brain anomalies. They passed away after 36 hours of follow-up in the neonatal intensive care unit at Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital.",

    "abstract": "Taller children tend to have better cognitive ability, and the relationship between height and cognition has been proposed as an explanation for the height-wage labor market premium. Height-cognition associations may arise due to social factors that favor taller individuals or be driven by \"common factors\" that are correlated with height and cognition. Indeed, there is now evidence of a genetic correlation between height and cognition that provides specific evidence for this concern. We examine whether genetic factors explain the relationship by estimating associations between childhood height and cognition in the Twins Early Development Study. We find that height is associated with better cognition even after controlling for genetic and environmental factors shared by twins. The association between height and cognition within fraternal twin pairs is also robust to controlling for individual genetic predictors of height and cognition. These results suggest that genetic factors are not solely responsible for driving the relationship between height and cognition.",

    "abstract": "Digital Twins (DTs) are used in many different industries (e.g., manufacturing, construction, automotive, and aerospace), and there is an initial trend of applications in healthcare, mainly focusing on precision medicine. If their potential is fully unfolded, DTs will facilitate the as-yet-unrealized potential of connected care and alter the way lifestyle, health, wellness, and chronic disease will be managed in the future. To date, however, due to technical, regulatory and ethical roadblocks, there is no consensus as to what extent DTs in healthcare can introduce revolutionary applications in the next decade. In this review, we present the current applications of DTs covering multiple areas of healthcare (precision medicine, clinical trial design, and hospital operations) to identify the opportunities and the barriers that foster or hinder their larger and faster diffusion. Finally, we discuss the current findings, opportunities and barriers, and provide recommendations to facilitate the continuous development of DTs application in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Investigating individuals with the most identical genetic background is optimal for minimizing the genetic contribution to gene expression. These individuals include monozygotic twins discordant for PD. Monozygotic twins have the same genetic background, age, sex, and often similar environmental conditions. The aim of this study was to carry out a transcriptome analysis of the peripheral blood of three pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for PD. We identified the metabolic process \"circadian behavior\" as a priority process for further study. Different expression of genes included in the term \"circadian behavior\" confirms that this process is involved in PD pathogenesis. We found increased expression of three genes associated with circadian behavior, i.e., ",

    "abstract": "In this perspective paper, we want to highlight the potential benefits of incorporating digital twins to support better dementia care. In particular, we assert that, by doing so, it is possible to ensure greater precision regarding dementia care while simultaneously enhancing personalization. Digital twins have been used successfully in manufacturing to enable better prediction and tailoring of solutions to meet required needs, and thereby have enabled more effective and efficient deployment of resources. We develop a model for digital twin in the healthcare domain as a clinical decision support tool by extrapolating its current uses from the manufacturing domain. We illustrate the power of the developed model in the context of dementia. Given the rapid rise of chronic conditions and the pressures on healthcare delivery to provide high quality, cost-effective care anywhere and anytime, we assert that such an approach is consistent with a value-based healthcare philosophy and thus important as the numbers of people with dementia continues to grow exponentially and this pressing healthcare issue is yet to be optimally addressed. Further research and development in this rapidly evolving domain is a strategic priority for ensuring the delivery of superior dementia care.",

    "abstract": "Although most digital twin (DT) applications for health care have emerged in precision medicine, DTs can potentially support the overall health care process. DTs (twinned systems, processes, and products) can be used to optimize flows, improve performance, improve health outcomes, and improve the experiences of patients, doctors, and other stakeholders with minimal risk.\nThis paper aims to review applications of DT systems, products, and processes as well as analyze the potential of these applications for improving health care management and the challenges associated with this emerging technology.\nWe performed a rapid review of the literature and reported available studies on DTs and their applications in health care management. We searched 5 databases for studies published between January 2002 and January 2022 and included peer-reviewed studies written in English. We excluded studies reporting DT usage to support health care practice (organ transplant, precision medicine, etc). Studies were analyzed based on their contribution toward DT technology to improve user experience in health care from human factors and systems engineering perspectives, accounting for the type of impact (product, process, or performance/system level). Challenges related to the adoption of DTs were also summarized.\nThe DT-related studies aimed at managing health care systems have been growing over time from 0 studies in 2002 to 17 in 2022, with 7 published in 2021 (N=17 studies). The findings reported on applications categorized by DT type (system: n=8; process: n=5; product: n=4) and their contributions or functions. We identified 4 main functions of DTs in health care management including safety management (n=3), information management (n=2), health management and well-being promotion (n=3), and operational control (n=9). DTs used in health care systems management have the potential to avoid unintended or unexpected harm to people during the provision of health care processes. They also can help identify crisis-related threats to a system and control the impacts. In addition, DTs ensure privacy, security, and real-time information access to all stakeholders. Furthermore, they are beneficial in empowering self-care abilities by enabling health management practices and providing high system efficiency levels by ensuring that health care facilities run smoothly and offer high-quality care to every patient.\nThe use of DTs for health care systems management is an emerging topic. This can be seen in the limited literature supporting this technology. However, DTs are increasingly being used to ensure patient safety and well-being in an organized system. Thus, further studies aiming to address the challenges of health care systems challenges and improve their performance should investigate the potential of DT technology. In addition, such technologies should embed human factors and ergonomics principles to ensure better design and more successful impact on patient and doctor experiences.",

    "abstract": "The Medical School of Padua (Italy) contributed profoundly to the study of teratology. Many famous physicians and professors of medicine, such as Liceti, Vallisneri, Morgagni, and Malacarne, have studied and investigated these anomalies to better understand the causes and to find a potential explanation, often preserving the specimens for future studies. The present study highlights some historical cases of conjoined twins and a conjoined triplet preserved at the Morgagni Museum of Human Anatomy to show the development of medical theories in the teratological field between the 18th and early 19th century. This approach will provide insights into different study methods and ideas of some of the most famous scholars working in Padua at that time. The current article focuses on rare cases, both human and animal, that were encountered by physicians who worked in the Veneto area in the late 18th and early 19th century. Their detailed descriptions are not only of historical but also of contemporary dysmorphological value.",

    "abstract": "Smoking is a known risk factor for the development of colorectal polyps. Even in familial adenomatous polyposis and serrated polyposis syndrome, smoking is a risk factor of the development of polyps. Here, we report a case of monozygotic twins with atypical colorectal polyposis showing lots of hyperplastic polyps and adenomas and describe how the polyposis developed differently in the brothers based on the presence or absence of smoking. The case was of a set of monozygotic male twins, and the twins were in their 50s. The younger brother smoked 40 cigarettes a day since he was 16 years old. The older brother had smoked about 25 cigarettes a day since he was 16 years old but stopped smoking after he was diagnosed with polyposis. As we previously reported, we managed to remove polyps as much as possible from both twins without surgery. The median number of removed polyps (IQR: 25-75%) per colonoscopy for 20 years was 9.0 (3.5-14.8) in the older brother and 20.5 (7.5-35.5) in the younger brother. There was a significant difference between the twins (",

A significant negative association emerged between HCC and family SES assessed in adolescence (\u03b2=-.11,p\u2009=\u2009.02), which was entirely explained by common underlying environmental influences. We also found evidence of stronger genetic contributions to HCC among youths who lived in more disadvantaged households during childhood in comparison to those from wealthier backgrounds.\nThis study provides first-time evidence that the association between adolescence SES and HCC is environmentally-explained and that genetic influences underlying HCC are not uniformly distributed across the family SES continuum measured during childhood.

The odds ratio was evaluated in twin pregnancies with detectable structural anomalies.\nThe annual average \"ultrasound prevalence of fetal anomalies\" among singleton and twin pregnancies were 1.09 and 3.06%, respectively. Mothers with twin anomalies were older (P\u2009<\u2009.001), and twin pregnancies were diagnosed with anomalies in earlier gestational weeks than singleton (P\u00a0=\u00a0.011). No differences were found in the types of anomalies between singleton and twin pregnancies. Central nervous system anomaly was the most common type in singleton and twin pregnancies. Twin pregnancies had higher rates of major anomalies than singleton (total OR 2.45), especially cardiovascular, central nervous, and gastrointestinal systems and ear/eye/face/neck disorders.\nCompared with singleton, twin pregnancies had higher odds of detectable structural anomalies. Twin pregnancies with structural anomalies were diagnosed at earlier gestational age and associated with older maternal age. Central nervous system anomaly was the most common type in singleton and twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined pygopagus accounts for about 17% of all conjoined twins and commonly share the gluteal region, terminal spine, lower gastrointestinal, urological, and reproductive tracts. This makes their separation a very challenging task. We report herein pygopagus twins who had minimal fusion in coccygeal region and could be separated without a complicated procedure. The case is being reported to add to the literature and emphasize that simple fusion in conjoined twins can be relatively easy to manage.",

    "abstract": "Delayed cord clamping increases placental transfusion. In vaginal deliveries higher hemoglobin concentrations are found in the second-born twin. We hypothesized it is unrelated to intertwin transfusion but to the time of cord clamping.\nIt was a prospective cohort study of 202 women delivering twins\u2009>\u200932\u00a0weeks of gestation. Monoamniotic pregnancy, antenatal intertwin transfusions, fetal demise or major abnormalities were excluded from the study. The time of cord clamping depended on the obstetrician's decision. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and reticulocyte count were measured at birth and during the second day of life.\nAt birth, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were significantly higher in the first-born twins delivered with delayed than with early cord clamping. Higher hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were observed during the second day of life in all twins delivered with delayed cord clamping. The lowest levels were observed in twins delivered with early cord clamping. Infants delivered with delayed cord clamping were at a lower risk of respiratory disorders and NICU hospitalization.\nThe observed differences in Hgb concentrations between the infants in a twin pregnancy are related to cord clamping time.",

    "abstract": "Guidelines promoting healthy lifestyles are cornerstones of chronic disease prevention and treatment. The purpose of this study is to investigate independent and joint associations of five key health behaviors with health outcomes (body mass index (BMI kg/m\nWe included 6,048 twin pairs from a community-based registry. Five key health behaviors were: (1)\u2009\u2265\u20098\u00a0h of sleep per night, (2)\u2009\u2265\u20095 servings of fruits and vegetables daily, (3)\u2009\u2264\u20092\u00a0h sedentary time per day, (4)\u2009\u2265\u2009150\u00a0min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week, and (5) no smoking. We analyzed phenotypic associations between behaviors and outcomes; whether phenotypic associations were confounded by additive genetic and shared environmental factors within twin pairs (\"quasi-causal\" associations); and which behaviors, considered simultaneously, had the largest associations with outcomes.\nWe found negative phenotypic associations between number of behaviors achieved with BMI and depressive symptoms score (ps\u2009<\u20090.05). Associations remained significant, though attenuated, when controlling for genetic and shared environmental factors, and demographics, for depressive symptoms score but not BMI (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Quantitative variable importance measures derived from regression tree models showed sedentary time and MVPA were the most important variables in partitioning twins with different BMI, and smoking and sedentary time for partitioning twins with different depressive symptoms score.\nAchievement of commonly endorsed health behaviors is associated with lower BMI (especially sedentary and MVPA targets) and depressive symptoms score (especially sedentary and smoking targets). This provides further support of health behavior promotion to improve health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Both genetic and environmental influences have been proposed to contribute to the variance of gender identity and development of gender dysphoria (GD), but the magnitude of the effect of each component remains unclear. We aimed to examine the prevalence of GD among twins and non-twin siblings of individuals with GD, using data derived from a large register-based population in Sweden over the period 2001-2016. Register data was collected from the Statistics Sweden and the National Board of Health and Welfare. The outcome of interest was defined as at least four diagnoses of GD or at least one diagnosis followed by gender-affirming treatment. A total of 2592 full siblings to GD cases were registered, of which 67 were twins; age at first GD diagnosis for the probands ranged from 11.2 to 64.2\u00a0years. No same-sex twins that both presented with GD were identified during the study period. The proportion of different-sex twins both presenting with GD (37%) was higher than that in same-sex twins (0%, Fisher's exact test p-value\u2009<\u20090.001) and in non-twin sibling pairs (0.16%). The present findings suggest that familial factors, mainly confined to shared environmental influences during the intrauterine period, seem to contribute to the development of GD.",

The professional literature is rich with twin studies of creativity, but lacking when it comes to specific artistic domains - for example, painting and sculpting. The section that follows provides reviews of current research on ethnic and racial factors affecting type of twin delivery, pregnancy outcomes when twins are conceived naturally or with reproductive assistance, the effects of intrauterine growth discordance on the timing of twin delivery, and three-dimensional (3D) assessment of twins' facial resemblance. The final section summarizes information about twins in the media. The stories include twins distinguished for both baseball playing and physical injuries, twins who reached the National College Athletic Association's Elite 8, a twin pair's grave and epitaph, a mother who conceived twins three times in 2 years, twins in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a set of superfetated twins.",

    "abstract": "The molecular basis of the evaluation of children suspected of having disorders of surfactant proteins is still under discussion. In this study, we aimed to describe the morphological characteristics and to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of surfactant proteins (surfactant protein A [SPA], surfactant protein B, and pro-surfactant protein C) in the preterm twins that deceased due to unexplained respiratory distress syndrome (n = 12). Results showed statistically significant positive correlations between surfactant protein B expressions and pulmonary hemorrhage (\u03c1 = 0.678; P < .05), SPA levels, and Apgar score (\u03c1 = 0.605; P < .05) and also expressions of SPA and bronchopneumonia (\u03c1 = 0.695; P < .05). The fetuses and neonates of the same gestational age showed differences among surfactant proteins regarding the immunostaining expression. Our data evidence a marked interindividual variability in the expression of all 3 surfactant proteins among the cases analyzed (n = 12), suggesting the intervention of some individual and epigenetic factors during gestation that might influence surfactant protein production and consequently survival rate.",

    "abstract": "A Digital Twin (DT) is a set of computer-generated models that map a physical object into a virtual space. Both physical and virtual elements exchange information to monitor, simulate, predict, diagnose and control the state and behavior of the physical object within the virtual space. DTs supply a system with information and operating status, providing capabilities to create new business models. In this paper, we focus on the construction of DTs. More specifically, we focus on determining (methodologically) how to design, create and connect physical objects with their virtual counterpart. We explore the problem into several phases: from functional requirement selection and architecture planning to integration and verification of the final (digital) models. We address as well how physical components exchange real-time information with DTs, as well as experimental platforms to build DTs (including protocols and standards). We conclude with a discussion and open challenges.",

    "abstract": "Background and objectives: Coffin-Lowry Syndrome (CLS), a rare neurodegenerative disorder, is mainly diagnosed based on clinical manifestations and molecular analyses. In total, about 20 cases of CLS have been reported in China. Here, we report two cases of CLS in identical twin brothers and examine their potential causative mutations. Methods: The Trio mode was used in this analysis, i.e., DNA from the proband and his parents was sequenced. Furthermore, DNA from the proband\u2019s twin brother was used for confirmation. Results: A hemizygous variation was detected in the 11th exon of the RPS6KA3 gene, c.898C>T (p.R300*) of the proband, and the same site variation was detected in his identical twin brother; however, the mutation was not detected in his parents. Conclusions: The RPS6KA3 gene mutation c.898C>T (p.R300*) is the causative factor of familial CLS. The variant detected was reported for the first time in the Chinese population. Additionally, by analyzing the previous literature, we were able to summarize the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of GLS in China.",

    "abstract": "The heritability of anxiety and its association with insomnia have been suggested. This study investigated the coincidence of anxiety and insomnia in monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins. The Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study 2005-2014 was used. The \u226520-year-old cohort population was composed of 1300 twin participants. A total of 980 monozygotic twins and 232 dizygotic twins were compared for the concordance for the history of insomnia in both twin pairs (coincidence of insomnia) and the difference in state of anxiety and trait of anxiety scores. The odds ratios (ORs) for the coincidence of insomnia in monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analysis. The estimated values (EV) of the difference of state and trait of anxiety scores were analyzed using a linear regression model. The coincidence of insomnia was not high in monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins. The difference in the state of anxiety score was comparable between monozygotic twins and dizygotic twins. However, the difference in anxiety scores was higher in dizygotic twins than in monozygotic twins. The monozygotic twin group did not demonstrate higher coincidence of insomnia or the state of anxiety than the dizygotic twin group. However, the monozygotic twin group indicated higher coincidence of the trait of anxiety than the dizygotic twins. The current results implied the potential contribution of heritable factors for the trait of anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Background: Wilson\u2019s disease (WD) is an autosomal-recessive disorder of copper deposition caused by pathogenic variants in the copper-transporting ATP7B gene. There is not a clear correlation between genotype and phenotype in WD regarding symptom manifestations. This is supported by the presentation of genetically identical WD twins with phenotypic discordance and different response behavior to WD-specific therapy. Case Presentation: One of the female homozygous twins (age: 26 yrs) developed writing, speaking, swallowing and walking deficits which led to in-patient examination without conclusive results but recommended genetic testing. Both sisters were tested and were heterozygous for the C.2304dupC;p(Met769Hisf*26) and the C.3207C>A;p(His1069Gln) mutation. Self-medication of the affected sibling with 450 mg D-penicillamine (DPA) did not prevent further deterioration. She developed a juvenile parkinsonian syndrome and became wheelchair-bound and anarthric. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was applied. Her asymptomatic sister helped her with her daily life. Despite the immediate increase of the DPA dose (up to 1800 mg within 3 weeks) in the severely affected patient and the initiation of DPA therapy (up to 600 mg within 2 weeks) in the asymptomatic patient after the first visit in our institution, liver function tests further deteriorated in both patients. After 2 months, the parkinsonian patient started to improve and walk again, but experienced several falls, broke her right shoulder and underwent two necessary surgical interventions. With further consequent copper elimination therapy, liver dysfunction improved in both patients, without need for orthotopic liver transplantation (LTX) in the severely affected patient. Her excellent recovery of liver and brain dysfunction was only transiently interrupted by the development of a nephrotic syndrome which disappeared after switching to Cuprior\u00ae. Unfortunately, she died from fulminant pneumonia. Conclusion: Despite identical genetic disposition, WD symptom presentations may develop differently in monozygotic twins, and they may need to be placed on a very different therapeutical regimen. The underlying gene-environment interaction is unclear so far.",

    "abstract": "To our knowledge, late, late-onset group B streptococcal (GBS) meningitis in identical twins has yet to be reported. We describe a case of 14-week-old twins who developed fever hours apart and presented simultaneously to the emergency department 2 days later with seizures. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures from both infants were positive for GBS. Their clinical courses were highly similar, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating ventriculitis and subdural empyema, complicated by clinical and subclinical seizures requiring quadruple antiepileptic treatment. The CSF was sterile for both on follow-up lumbar puncture 48 hours after the initial positive CSF culture. Both showed marked improvement on antimicrobial and antiepileptic therapy, with fever resolving after 5 days of therapy, control of seizures, and slowly improving MRI findings. Twin A received a 6-week course of penicillin, whereas twin B received 6 weeks plus an additional 10 days due to persistent left cochlear enhancement consistent with labyrinthitis. Evaluation for an underlying primary immunodeficiency was negative. Genomic analysis revealed that the patients' CSF GBS isolates were essentially identical and of capsular polysaccharide serotype Ia.",

    "abstract": "Singletons born after fetal growth restriction (FGR) are at increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Studies of singletons with FGR usually compare outcomes with those without FGR, a comparison that is inherently biased by obstetrical, parental, and genetic factors. We aim to compare neurodevelopmental outcomes between the smaller and larger twin in a population of discordant identical twins who shared a single placenta (monochorionic diamniotic), naturally eliminating these confounders.\nThis study is part of the cohort study LEMON of monochorionic diamniotic twins with selective FGR. All monochorionic diamniotic twins with selective FGR who were born in Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, Netherlands) between March 1, 2002, and Dec 31, 2017, were eligible for inclusion. Twin pregnancies that were complicated by twin-twin transfusion syndrome, twin anaemia polycythaemia sequence, or monoamnionicity were excluded. Cognitive performance was evaluated with two standardised psychometric age-appropriate tests, producing a full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ). Motor functioning was assessed with a standardised neurological examination. A composite outcome of neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) was used, subdivided into mild NDI (defined as FSIQ <85, minor neurological dysfunction or cerebral palsy grade 1, or mild visual or hearing impairment) and severe NDI (defined as FSIQ <70, severe neurological dysfunction, or severe visual or hearing impairment).\nBetween Jan 25, 2021, and March 15, 2022, 47 twin pairs were enrolled in the study and underwent neurodevelopmental assessment. The median gestational age at birth was 33\u00b79 weeks (IQR 31\u00b73-36\u00b70) for the 47 included twin pairs, with median birthweights of 1400 g (1111-1875) in the smaller twin and 2003 g (1600-2680) in the larger twin. The median age at neurodevelopmental assessment was 11 years (8-13). Median FSIQ was 94 (86-101) for the smaller twin and 100 (92-108) for the larger twin (p<0\u00b70001). More smaller twins had mild NDI (17 [36%] of 47) than did the larger twins (five [11%] of 47; odds ratio 4\u00b78 [95% CI 1\u00b76-14\u00b71]; p=0\u00b70049). There was no difference in the proportion of children with severe NDI (two [4%] of 47 in both groups, p=1\u00b70).\nAs mild NDI can impede children in their daily functioning, we recommend standardised long-term follow-up, including neurodevelopmental testing, for monochorionic diamniotic twins with selective FGR to facilitate early identification of children at risk.\nThe Dutch Heart Foundation.",

    "abstract": "Multiple pregnancy is a known predisposing factor for sagittal suture synostosis, and intrauterine constraint has been suggested as a potential cause. This study evaluates prenatal images of single and multiple pregnancies of children with sagittal suture synostosis to assess the possible pathogenesis.\nPrenatal ultrasound data of scaphocephaly twins treated at Erasmus MC was retrieved retrospectively. The head circumference, cephalic index (CI), and biparietal diameter (BPD) were analyzed. Data were compared with the nonaffected sibling, singletons with scaphocephaly, and to general fetal growth reference values.\nData of 8 twin pregnancies with 10 cases of scaphocephaly was gathered. For the head circumference no difference was found between affected fetuses and reference values throughout pregnancy. For the BPD a reduced growth was found, compared with control values. The growth curve for the CI of the affected twins is lower from the start and declines over time. When comparing affected fetuses to nonaffected fetuses, the same differences for the BPD and CI were found as compared with controls. No differences in growth parameters were found between the nonaffected siblings and reference values, nor between the affected scaphocephaly twins and singletons with scaphocephaly.\nScaphocephaly in twin pregnancy develops early on in pregnancy, similar to singleton pregnancy, making the theory of constraint as a cause less likely. The development of scaphocephaly in twins is likely to be attributed to the same disturbed developmental processes in suture development as in singletons, and not to mechanical constraint.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all our lives, not only through the infection itself but also through the measures taken to control the spread of the virus (e.g. lockdown).\nHere, we investigated how the COVID-19 pandemic and unprecedented lockdown affected the mental health of young adults in England and Wales.\nWe compared the mental health symptoms of up to 4773 twins in their mid-20s in 2018 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (T1) and during four-wave longitudinal data collection during the pandemic in April, July and October 2020, and in March 2021 (T2-T5) using phenotypic and genetic longitudinal designs.\nThe average changes in mental health were small to medium and mainly occurred from T1 to T2 (average Cohen d = 0.14). Despite the expectation of catastrophic effects of the pandemic on mental health, we did not observe trends in worsening mental health during the pandemic (T3-T5). Young people with pre-existing mental health problems were disproportionately affected at the beginning of the pandemic, but their increased problems largely subsided as the pandemic persisted. Twin analyses indicated that the aetiology of individual differences in mental health symptoms did not change during the lockdown (average heritability 33%); the average genetic correlation between T1 and T2-T5 was 0.95, indicating that genetic effects before the pandemic were substantially correlated with genetic effects up to a year later.\nWe conclude that on average the mental health of young adults in England and Wales has been remarkably resilient to the effects of the pandemic and associated lockdown.",

    "results": "The average changes in mental health were small to medium and mainly occurred from T1 to T2 (average Cohen d = 0.14). Despite the expectation of catastrophic effects of the pandemic on mental health, we did not observe trends in worsening mental health during the pandemic (T3-T5). Young people with pre-existing mental health problems were disproportionately affected at the beginning of the pandemic, but their increased problems largely subsided as the pandemic persisted. Twin analyses indicated that the aetiology of individual differences in mental health symptoms did not change during the lockdown (average heritability 33%); the average genetic correlation between T1 and T2-T5 was 0.95, indicating that genetic effects before the pandemic were substantially correlated with genetic effects up to a year later.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 25% of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cases are defined by hyperdiploidy, with RAS mutations occurring in 30% of hyperdiploid B-ALL patients. It is believed that hyperdiploidy is an in utero event with RAS mutations occurring postnatally, but clinical evidence of this is based on relatively few patients. We present a case of monozygotic, monochorionic twins who developed concordant hyperdiploid B-ALL with identical chromosomal gains but different RAS mutations, adding further evidence that hyperdiploidy is occurring prenatally, with RAS mutations developing postnatally. Environmental exposures were reviewed with the family without identification of a clear association.",

Of these, the ones affecting the thyroid gland have been reported, especially in the adults.\nWe present previously healthy twin adolescents with no history of thyroid disease, presenting with signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism after recovery from mild COVID-19 infection. Their investigations were consistent with auto-immune thyroiditis with primary hypothyroidism, showing markedly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), suppressed FT4 levels, positive anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody and anti-thyroglobulin antibody titres. They were treated accordingly and showed quick clinical improvement in symptoms.\nThis case report demonstrates that COVID-19 infection can be temporally associated with primary hypothyroidism in genetically predisposed children adding more to the growing list of sequelae especially in children.",

    "abstract": "To assess whether antenatal corticosteroid treatment is associated with improved neonatal outcomes in twins.\nWe searched MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, from inception through August 12, 2021. We did not search ClinicalTrials.gov because our inclusion criteria were restricted to nonrandomized studies.\nRecords (n=7,802) were screened in Rayyan by two independent reviewers. We included all nonrandomized studies that compared antenatal corticosteroid treatment with no treatment in twins. Our outcomes of interest were neonatal mortality, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, periventricular leukomalacia, and retinopathy of prematurity.\nWe used the ROBINS-I tool (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions) to assess risk of bias. We performed random-effects meta-analyses of estimates from studies without critical risk of bias due to confounding, and reported summary adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs. Eighteen cohort studies (that reported on 33,152 neonates) met inclusion criteria. Sixteen studies restricted to preterm gestational ages, and 11 defined exposed neonates based on an optimal corticosteroid administration-to-birth interval. Limitations due to confounding and selection bias were common concerns for the risk-of-bias assessments (n=14 at critical or higher), and 11 studies did not account for clustering within twin pairs in their analyses. All included studies had at least moderate risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed that antenatal corticosteroid administration was associated with lower odds of neonatal mortality (aOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43-0.80, I2 69%, five studies, 20,312 neonates) and RDS (aOR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.86, I2 67%, seven studies, 20,628 neonates) in twins. Results were inconclusive for the other outcomes.\nEvidence from nonrandomized studies suggests antenatal corticosteroids are associated with lower incidence of neonatal mortality and RDS in twins.\nPROSPERO, CRD42020205302.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the relationships between fetal quantitative Doppler parameters and amniotic fluid N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (afNT-proBNP) levels as a biomarker of the increased cardiac load in recipient twins with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS).\nThis single-center, prospective study included all monochorionic diamniotic (MD) twin pregnancies that were diagnosed with TTTS and underwent fetoscopic laser surgery. Doppler flow was used to measure the pulsatility index (PI) of the umbilical artery (UA), ductus venosus (DV), and middle cerebral artery (MCA) of each recipient and donor twins. The afNT-proBNP levels of recipient twins were examined at the time of surgery. The Spearman or Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationships between afNT-proBNP levels and Doppler parameters.\nA total of 150 MD twin pregnancies were included. The afNT-proBNP levels of the recipient twins showed a stronger correlation with the DV-PI (r\u2009=\u20090.637; P\u2009<\u20090.001) of recipient twins than with the UA-PI and MCA-PI of recipient twins. The Doppler parameters of donor twins were scarcely correlated with the afNT-proBNP levels of the recipient twins.\nA positive correlation between the DV-PI and afNT-proBNP levels of recipient twins with TTTS was observed. The recipient twin with an increased DV-PI is expected to be under a high cardiac load; therefore, DV-PI is a useful parameter for assessing increased NT-proBNP levels consecutively and noninvasively.\nThis study was registered with Japanese Clinical Trial Registry \"UMIN-CTR\" ( http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index-j.htm ; trial ID numbers UMIN000024486 and 000037702).",

Twin 1 had Ebstein's anomaly, and received surgical treatment and recovered satisfactorily. Twin 2 had only partial tricuspid septal prolapse, and pulmonary hypertension occurred during follow-up.\nIt is necessary to carry out individualized diagnosis and treatment for twins and follow-up observation by echocardiography for a long time.

    "abstract": "Monochorionic dizygotic twins are a rare condition, mostly related to assisted reproductive technology. This type of twinning is burdened by the same risk of pregnancy complications found in monochorionic monozygotic pregnancies.\nWe report a case of spontaneous monochorionic dizygotic twins sharing situs inversus abdominalis and isolated levocardia, with only one twin affected by biliary atresia with splenic malformation syndrome. We also conducted a literature review of the 14 available documented monochorionic dizygotic twin gestations spontaneously conceived.\nIt is still unclear how this unusual type of twinning can occur in spontaneous conception. The evidence so far suggest the importance to timely diagnose the chorionicity, in order to adequately manage the typical complications associated with monochorionicity.",

    "abstract": "There is no standard birth weight curve for twins in Japan other than a prototype curve based on 1988-1991. Twins have a high perinatal mortality rate than singletons; therefore, we developed a new standard curve for twin birth weight using data from the 1995-2016 Vital Statistics and compared it with previous reports. We used 469,064 cases for analysis, excluding stillbirths and cases with missing values, and created a standard curve using LMS (statistical methods to vary the distribution by using skewness, median, and coefficient of variation) method. In comparison with previous reports, the mean birth weight decreased by 100-200 g. The groups with the lowest neonatal death rates (NDRs) and infant death rates (IDRs) were those with a birth weight of 1,500-2,499 g (NDR: 0.3%, IDR: 0.6%) and those born at 34-36 weeks (NDR: 0.2%, IDR: 0.4%). Compared to these, the IDR was significantly higher in the 2,500-3,999 g group and the 37-39 weeks group (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.1 in the 2,500-3,999 g group, IRR: 1.3 in the 37w0d-39w6d group). In particular, the risks of neonatal mortality and infant mortality were higher in infants born at a birth weight above 3,500 g. Infants born at a birth weight above 3,500 g may include recipients of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. The most common causes of infant mortality are accidental death and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). We considered the possibility that infants treated as healthy newborns and whose mothers were discharged from the hospital without adequate twin care guidance may be more likely to experience unintentional accidents and SIDS at home. The present study suggested that creating a new twin birth weight standard curve and guidance on managing twins at home for full-term and normal birth weight infants may lead to a reduction in infant deaths.",

    "abstract": "While language is expressed in multiple modalities, including sign, writing, or whistles, speech is arguably the most common. The human vocal tract is capable of producing the bewildering diversity of the 7000 or so currently spoken languages, but relatively little is known about its genetic bases, especially in what concerns normal variation. Here, we capitalize on five cohorts totaling 632 Dutch twins with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Two raters placed clearly defined (semi)landmarks on each MRI scan, from which we derived 146 measures capturing the dimensions and shape of various vocal tract structures, but also aspects of the head and face. We used Genetic Covariance Structure Modeling to estimate the additive genetic, common environmental or non-additive genetic, and unique environmental components, while controlling for various confounds and for any systematic differences between the two raters. We found high heritability, h",

    "abstract": "The time during which there is an increased risk of death for cancer survivors was evaluated in a large twin study, which allows for matching on shared components such as age, genes, and socioeconomic factors in childhood.\nBy use of data from Danish registers, time to death from initial cancer was studied prospectively in twins in two different settings. The twins were diagnosed with at least one cancer in the period 1943 to 2011. Setting I included 5,680 same-sex twin pairs aged 6 and over, while Setting II included 3,218 twin individuals from age 70 and over. The study provides comparisons within twin pairs and across birth cohorts, age at diagnoses, and time at diagnosis.\nIn 2001 to 2011, the 5-year mortality risk for a twin surviving cancer after the age of 70 was twofold that of the co-twin, regardless of sex and zygosity, and it was 1.5-fold if the twin survived the initial 9 months. After 5 to 6 years, the mortality risk corresponded to that of the co-twin. In previous decades, the excess hazard risk was considerably higher for both older and younger cohorts. There were no indications of change in relative survival across old birth cohorts.\nThis large twin study suggested that for a cancer-treatment survivor diagnosed at age 70 or later, the additional mortality risk was largely absent 5 years later, by which time the survival relative to the co-twin was 60%.\nElevated mortality risk after cancer is offset after 5 to 6 years.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review aims to assess the gestational age at birth and perinatal outcome [intrauterine demise (IUD), neonatal mortality and severe cerebral injury] in monochorionic twins with selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR), according to Gratac\u00f3s classification based on umbilical artery Doppler flow patterns in the smaller twin. Seventeen articles were included. Gestational age at birth varied from 33.0 to 36.0\u00a0weeks in type I, 27.6-32.4\u00a0weeks in type II, and 28.3-33.8\u00a0weeks in type III. IUD rate differed from 0%-4% in type I to 0%-40% in type II and 0%-23% in type III. Neonatal mortality rate was between 0%-10% in type I, 0%-38% in type II, and 0%-17% in type III. Cerebral injury was present in 0%-2% of type I, 2%-30% of type II and 0%-33% of type III cases. The timing of delivery in sFGR varied substantially among studies, particularly in type II and III. The quality of evidence was moderate due to heterogenous study populations with varying definitions of sFGR and perinatal outcome parameters, as well as a lack of consensus on the use of the Gratac\u00f3s classification, leading to substantial incomparability. Our review identifies the urgent need for uniform antenatal diagnostic criteria and definitions of outcome parameters.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twins (MC) are at high risk of adverse outcomes and Doppler investigation of umbilical and cerebral flows is mandatory for their surveillance. The cerebro-placental (CPR) and umbilico-cerebral (UCR) ratios are considered non-invasive measures of fetal adaptation to hypoxemia. We aimed to provide longitudinal references for CPR and UCR from 16 to 37\u00a0weeks of gestation that are specific for MC twins, and compare these with singleton charts.\nLongitudinal study of a cohort of consecutive uncomplicated MC twin pregnancies monitored at our unit from 2010 to 2018. The estimated centile curves were obtained estimating the median with fractional polynomials by a multilevel model and the external centiles through the residuals. The comparison with singletons references was made through graphic evaluation.\nOne-hundred-fifty-two MC pregnancies were included with a median of 10 longitudinal ultrasounds each. References for CPR and UCR in function of gestational age are presented. Compared to singletons, MC twins showed an earlier and greater circulatory redistribution with lower CPR and higher UCR median values.\nMC twin-specific references for CPR and UCR suitable for serial monitoring are presented. The comparison with singleton references demonstrates substantial differences in the hemodynamic balance that must be considered when interpreting findings in MC twins.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus (CMV) congenital infection present with similar clinical pictures. Both infections have long-term sequelae that can be mitigated by early detection and treatment. Coinfection is uncommonly reported.\nDichorionic diamniotic twins born at 35 weeks of gestation were investigated for congenital infections due to abnormalities on the antenatal scan at 31 weeks of gestation. Antenatal investigations were delayed due to late booking and delay in maternal investigations. In the neonatal period, they suffered discordant symptoms and were both investigated for Toxoplasma gondii infection. This diagnosis was confirmed in twin 2 but proved difficult in twin 1 who had a weakly positive polymerase chain reaction with inconclusive serology. Twin 1 was also diagnosed with congenital CMV, further complicating the clinical picture. Toxoplasmosis can cause long-term sequelae, and definitive diagnosis requires serology at 12 months of age; in view of this, treatment for congenital toxoplasmosis was initiated in both twins. Twin 1 was also treated for congenital CMV.\nDue to limitations in serological investigations in neonates, diagnosing congenital toxoplasmosis can be challenging, and initiating treatment may be warranted in suspected cases, given the risk of infective complications. Discordant presentations between twins are known in congenital toxoplasmosis and CMV, but coinfection has rarely been reported without concurrent immunocompromise. A high index of suspicion should be maintained in the twin of an infected neonate, and the possibility of multiple infections should be considered. Multidisciplinary working is crucial in reaching a diagnosis and treating appropriately.",

    "abstract": "Duplication of the distal end of chromosome 15q has been previously implicated in a characteristic overgrowth syndrome. Additionally, many patients have other congenital malformations, including cardiac, renal, genital, and musculoskeletal anomalies. However, some patients may present with intrauterine growth restriction and short stature. Different breakpoints within 15q, as well as different environmental factors, may underlie these varied presentations.\nWe discuss monochorionic-diamniotic twins with a ~345\u2009kb maternally inherited duplication in 15q26.3. The twins presented with discordant pathology-one twin with a single umbilical artery, selective intrauterine growth restriction, and multiple cardiac defects including aortic coarctation, aortic valve stenosis, and ventricular septal defect, whereas the other twin was unaffected. To our knowledge, this case represents the smallest reported duplication of distal 15q.\nThe discordant phenotype seen in the twins is likely due to a complex interplay between genetic and environmental causes. The affected infant presented prenatally with growth restriction and a single umbilical artery rather than overgrowth, potentially due to a unique breakpoint within 15q. This, in turn, may have produced hemodynamic perturbations between the twins, leading to discordant cardiac disease. Our report thus highlights the importance of genetic and nongenetic mechanisms underlying discordant anomalies in monochorionic twins.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious viral illness caused by the RNA virus Coronaviridae subtype severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Rapid infection caused by this virus became overwhelming and resulted in millions of deaths worldwide. The effects of smoking have been heavily studied and lead to increased occurrence of COVID-19 viral infections and mortality. The phenomenon of cytokine storm has been shown as one of the leading factors of mortality. However, the question remains as to what factors, either genetic or environmental, ultimately lead to the increased incidence of cytokine storms compared to others. We present a case of two cohabitating, 57-year-old, male, identical twins (Twin A and Twin B) who contracted SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously. Both Twin A and Twin B had similar medical histories, except for Twin A being a former smoker while Twin B a current smoker. While both twins presented with cough and shortness of breath, Twin A also presented with hypoxia, leukocytosis, evidence of acute kidney injury, and transaminitis while Twin B presented normoxic with solely tachycardia. Due to his presentation and vital signs, Twin B received Bamlanivimab but developed hypoxia during the infusion. Both twins were subsequently initiated on Remdesivir, dexamethasone, and supplemental oxygen daily. After completion of treatment courses, both twins had improvement in their laboratory values and were subsequently discharged with supplemental oxygen to be further weaned in the outpatient setting. Due to the twins' cohabitation, contracting SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, and similar medical history, we highlight the potential mechanism of nicotine's chemical ability to blunt the subsequent inflammatory process of COVID-19. Despite nicotine's potential ability to dampen cytokine storms, smoking has well-documented adverse effects and we, like many experts, entirely discourage it. However, given the rare situation of identical twins contracting SARS-CoV-2, we can extrapolate information regarding the effects of the virus without obfuscation from genetic and environmental factors to identify areas of research for new therapies.",

The challenges in management of such anomalies span the entire continuum of care from delivery to resuscitation to separation and finally discharge. Scheduled separation is ideal, occasionally the caring team is faced with no option but to perform an emergent separation. Omphalopagus is a type of conjoined twinning characterized by union of the peritoneal cavities through an infraumbilical abdominal wall defect. In this report we describe our experience with a successful emergency separation of extremely preterm omphalopagus twins.

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is a complex brain structure with key roles in cognitive and emotional processing and with subregion abnormalities associated with a range of disorders and psychopathologies. Here we combine data from two large independent young adult twin/sibling cohorts to obtain the most accurate estimates to date of genetic covariation between hippocampal subfield volumes and the hippocampus as a single volume. The combined sample included 2148 individuals, comprising 1073 individuals from 627 families (mean age = 22.3 years) from the Queensland Twin IMaging (QTIM) Study, and 1075 individuals from 454 families (mean age = 28.8 years) from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Hippocampal subfields were segmented using FreeSurfer version 6.0 (CA4 and dentate gyrus were phenotypically and genetically indistinguishable and were summed to a single volume). Multivariate twin modeling was conducted in OpenMx to decompose variance into genetic and environmental sources. Bivariate analyses of hippocampal formation and each subfield volume showed that 10%-72% of subfield genetic variance was independent of the hippocampal formation, with greatest specificity found for the smaller volumes; for example, CA2/3 with 42% of genetic variance being independent of the hippocampus; fissure (63%); fimbria (72%); hippocampus-amygdala transition area (41%); parasubiculum (62%). In terms of genetic influence, whole hippocampal volume is a good proxy for the largest hippocampal subfields, but a poor substitute for the smaller subfields. Additive genetic sources accounted for 49%-77% of total variance for each of the subfields in the combined sample multivariate analysis. In addition, the multivariate analyses were sufficiently powered to identify common environmental influences (replicated in QTIM and HCP for the molecular layer and CA4/dentate gyrus, and accounting for 7%-16% of total variance for 8 of 10 subfields in the combined sample). This provides the clearest indication yet from a twin study that factors such as home environment may influence hippocampal volumes (albeit, with caveats).",

    "abstract": "Conjoined triplets are among the rarest of human malformations, as are asymmetric or parasitic conjoined twins. Based on a very modest corpus of recent literature, we applied the embryonic disk model of conjoined twinning to 10 previously reported cases involving asymmetric anatomical multiplications to determine whether they concerned conjoined twins or conjoined triplets. In spite of their phenotypic similarities, we diagnosed four of these cases as conjoined twins and three of them as conjoined triplets. In the remaining three cases, no definite diagnosis could be made, as essential information was lacking from the reports. We conclude that it is not necessarily the expected duplication or triplication of structures that points to the correct diagnosis in these cases, but the number and mutual position of the hearts they presented with. Considering their rarity we stress to thoroughly investigate and describe internal (dys)morphology in novel cases of (asymmetric) conjoined twins and triplets to further unravel their pathogenicity and come to the correct diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, our understanding of their roles is far from complete. Herein, we explored de novo TE insertions (dnTEIs) and de novo variants (DNVs) across the genomes of dizygotic twins with ASD and their parents. The neuronal regulatory elements had a tendency to harbor dnTEIs that were shared between twins, but ASD-risk genes had dnTEIs that were unique to each twin. The dnTEIs were 4.6-fold enriched in enhancers that are active in embryonic stem cell (ESC)-neurons (p\u2009<\u20090.001), but DNVs were 1.5-fold enriched in active enhancers of astrocytes (p\u2009=\u20090.0051). Our findings suggest that dnTEIs and DNVs play a role in ASD etiology by disrupting enhancers of neurons and astrocytes.",

    "abstract": "The increased risks of various obstetric, maternal and fetal comorbidities of monochorionic twin pregnancies are widely known. However, despite its high prevalence and significance, the assessment of neurological morbidity as more commonly in selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) is concerned with more health care. This literature review aims to provide more information about such an assessment. To this end, retrospective cases of sFGR were studied in monochorionic twins, already diagnosed, classified and who had the recommended management, published between 2001 and 2018 in 17 scientific articles. In the assessment of fetal mortality, the highest risk of death of the restricted fetus was found in type 3 of sFGR, while type 2 sFGR was responsible for the highest death rates of both fetuses and also the lowest mean gestational age at delivery, 30.9 weeks. Regarding neurological morbidity, however, studies have shown a higher risk of brain damage in the habitually growing twin compared to the restricted one in the case of sFGR. This may be due to prematurity or intermittent diastolic flow on Doppler in type 2 and 3 of sFGR, however, statements about its pathophysiology still lack further studies.",

    "abstract": "The focus of this article is on insights gained from the extraordinary dynamics that took place between a pair of reunited monozygotic female twins from Greece. Topics include visualizing the co-twin prior to meeting, the unique love and attraction between the twins, a mother's response to discovering her child's cotwin and the challenges posed by insufficient kinship categories. The following section of this article surveys four recent twin research reports. They include Bereavement and Lifespan Associations; Novel Mutations in Twins; Parenting Premature Multiples; and Conjoined Twins. The final part of this article presents interesting and informative news about twins from popular sources. The topics covered are the passing of Madeline Albright (Secretary of State and mother of twins); identical twin songwriters; visually impaired twin and sibling skiiers; identical twin brothers who both received heart transplants; and the naming of the Genain quadruplets.",

    "abstract": "By combining virtual reality, the digital twin system has been deeply applied in many places. Especially with the upsurge of national sports and more attention to sports, people have also begun a more in-depth study on the strategy of sports training. This paper aims to explore the application of the Brazilian jujitsu training strategy and interactive control method in the new era. Based on the sports skills of Brazilian jujitsu, combined with digital twin technology and wireless sensor network technology, this paper develops a sports training system based on Brazilian jujitsu. It can collect the action information of the trainer and twin it into the simulation system so as to carry out better and more effective confrontation training. The experimental results show that the average delay time is 5.2\u2009ms and the maximum delay time is 6.5\u2009ms, which is less than the limit delay time of 20\u2009ms. Compared with the control group, it achieved quite good results. It shows the effectiveness of the system designed in this paper for trick jujitsu training.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: As common retinopathy is observed in low-birth infants, the characteristics of ROP in twins are worth exploring. The present study tried to demonstrate the risk factors of treatment for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in twins both diagnosed with ROP. Methods: A retrospective, institution-based cohort study of 62 premature ROP twin pairs with a mean gestational age (GA) younger than 35 weeks and a birth weight (BW) lower than 2500 g. Only infants with a follow-up period longer than 6 months and complete treatment records were included. The demographic data, treatment requirements and further rescue treatments were all collected and analyzed for all infants according to whether they accepted treatments. Moreover, all twin infants were divided into small and large twin groups according to birth weight, and they were also categorized as three groups according to the treatment requirement including both twins receiving treatment (BT group), one of the twins receiving treatment (ST group) and none of the twins receiving treatment (NT group). Comparisons of demographic data, treatment requirements and further rescue treatments were all conducted according to the different grouping methods. Results: The mean GA of the enrolled infants was (29.29 \u00b1 2.45) weeks with a mean BW of (1335.77 \u00b1 390.36) grams. Among them, 110 infants were mechanically ventilated. Fifty-one of the infants did not receive any treatment and 73 infants received laser or intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents. In total, 64 infants only underwent intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents or laser treatment, while the other nine infants received scleral buckling or vitrectomy as a necessary treatment when the retinal detachment was observed. No significantly different mechanical ventilation or treatment requirements could be observed between the small twin group and the large twin group (p = 0.73, 0.94). The twins in the BT groups showed the lowest BW, while the NT group infants had the highest BW. The GA for the BT, ST and NT groups were (27.86 \u00b1 1.87) weeks, (29.60 \u00b1 1.52) weeks and (31.33 \u00b1 2.39) weeks, respectively, and showed significant differences as well (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Being a small twin in twin-paired ROP without a high BW discordant will not increase the risk for treatment requirement or additional surgery necessity with a much more severe stage of ROP.",

    "abstract": "The surgical procedure to separate conjoined twins represents a rare and major challenge. One of the most feared perioperative scenarios is the presence of coagulopathy secondary to bleeding. We present a case of the surgical separation of ischiopagus tetrapus twins using a patient blood management strategy encompassing a tranexamic acid infusion, intraoperative viscoelastic testing, and early fibrinogen supplementation to reduce bleeding and transfusions. This approach allowed early detection and treatment of acquired hypofibrinogenemia, which resulted in minimal exposure to blood products. This case reflects the increasing clinical interest in early avoidance of fibrinogen deficiency in complex noncardiac pediatric surgery.",

    "abstract": "To determine the rate of fetal and neonatal brain lesions and define risk factors for such lesions in pregnancies complicated by Twin Anemia Polycythemia Sequence (TAPS).\nA retrospective cohort study of monochorionic twin pregnancies which were diagnosed with TAPS in a single tertiary medical center between 2013 and 2021. Pregnancies were followed with fetal brain neurosonogram every 2\u00a0weeks and fetal brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) was performed when indicated at 28-32\u00a0weeks of gestation; post-natal brain imaging included neonatal brain ultrasound. Pregnancies with pre- and post-natal brain lesions were compared to those without such findings.\nOverall, 23 monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies were diagnosed with TAPS over the study period resulting in perinatal survival of 91.3% (42/46). In 6/23 (26%) pregnancies and 7/46 (15.2%) fetuses pre- or post-natal brain lesions were detected, of whom five were the polycythemic twins and two were the anemic twins. Brain findings included intra-cerebral hemorrhage and ischemic lesions and were diagnosed prenatally in 6/7 (85.7%) cases. No risk factors for severe brain lesions were identified.\nTAPS may place the fetuses and neonates at increased risk for cerebral injuries. Incorporation of fetal brain imaging protocols may enhance precise prenatal diagnosis and allow for accurate parental counseling and post-natal care.",

    "abstract": "Although prophylactic tranexamic acid administration after cesarean delivery resulted in a lower incidence of calculated estimated blood loss of >1000 mL or red cell transfusion by day 2, its failure to reduce the incidence of hemorrhage-related secondary clinical outcomes (TRAnexamic Acid for Preventing Postpartum Hemorrhage Following a Cesarean Delivery trial) makes its use questionable. The magnitude of its effect may differ in women at higher risk of blood loss, including those with multiple pregnancies.\nThis study aimed to compare the effect of tranexamic acid vs placebo to prevent blood loss after cesarean delivery among women with multiple pregnancies.\nThis was a secondary analysis of the TRAnexamic Acid for Preventing Postpartum Hemorrhage Following a Cesarean Delivery trial data, a double-blind, randomized controlled trial from March 2018 to January 2020 in 27 French maternity hospitals, that included 319 women with multiple pregnancies. Women with a cesarean delivery before or during labor at \u226534 weeks of gestation were randomized to receive intravenously 1 g of tranexamic acid (n=160) or placebo (n=159), both with prophylactic uterotonics. The primary outcome was a calculated estimated blood loss of >1000 mL or a red blood cell transfusion by 2 days after delivery. The secondary outcomes included clinical and laboratory blood loss measurements.\nOf the 4551 women randomized in this trial, 319 had a multiple pregnancy and cesarean delivery, and 298 (93.4%) had primary outcome data available. This outcome occurred in 62 of 147 women (42.2%) in the tranexamic acid group and 67 of 152 (44.1%) receiving placebo (adjusted risk ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-1.38; P=.86). No significant between-group differences occurred for any hemorrhage-related clinical outcomes: gravimetrically estimated blood loss, provider-assessed clinically significant hemorrhage, additional uterotonics, postpartum blood transfusion, arterial embolization, and emergency surgery (P>.05 for all comparisons).\nAmong women with a multiple pregnancy and cesarean delivery, prophylactic tranexamic acid did not reduce the incidence of any blood loss-related outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare form of monozygotic and monoamniotic twins. Fetal prognosis is very poor and, if the diagnosis is made early, it most often requires therapeutic abortion. We here report a case of three-hour old thoracopagus conjoined twins who were born vaginally, at term, at 40 weeks + 3 days. They were born to non-consanguineous parents, without any significant pathological history. Their mother was young and primiparous. She received 5 antenatal visits and 3 obstetric ultrasounds were performed by an inexperienced physician. The diagnosis of thoracopages twins was suspected based on clinical examination and computerized tomography (CT) results. This test showed cardiovascular abnormalities incompatible with life. The twins died after 23 hours of age due to acute respiratory distress. Conjoined twins are a rare congenital abnormality. Early diagnosis based on ultrasound would help to determine common anatomical structures, investigate associated congenital abnormalities, schedule delivery in a suitable structure and multidisciplinary neonatal management.\nLes jumeaux conjoints sont une malformation rare des grossesses g\u00e9mellaires monozygotes et mono-amniotiques. Le pronostic f\u0153tal de cette malformation reste tr\u00e8s sombre, n\u00e9cessitant un recours \u00e0 une interruption de la grossesse si le diagnostic est pos\u00e9 pr\u00e9cocement. Nous rapportons le cas de \u00ab jumeaux conjoints thoracopages \u00bb de H3 de vie, n\u00e9s \u00e0 terme \u00e0 40 SA + 3 jours, par voie basse. Ils sont n\u00e9s de parents non consanguins, sans ant\u00e9c\u00e9dent pathologique notable. La m\u00e8re \u00e9tait jeune, primipare. La grossesse \u00e9tait suivie avec 5 consultations pr\u00e9natales et 3 \u00e9chographies obst\u00e9tricales r\u00e9alis\u00e9es par un m\u00e9decin inexp\u00e9riment\u00e9.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a long-term trend of smart hospital development. However, there is no consistent conceptualization of what a smart hospital entails. Few hospitals have genuinely reached being \"smart,\" primarily failing to bring systems together and consider implications from all perspectives. Hospital Intelligent Twins, a new technology integration powered by IoT, AI, cloud computing, and 5G application to create all-scenario intelligence for health care and hospital management. This communication presented a smart hospital for all-scenario intelligence by creating the hospital Intelligent Twins. Intelligent Twins is widely involved in medical activities. However, solving the medical ethics, protecting patient privacy, and reducing security risks involved are significant challenges for all-scenario intelligence applications. This exploration of creating hospital Intelligent Twins that can be a worthwhile endeavor to assess how to inform evidence-based decision-making better and enhance patient satisfaction and outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Do drinking patterns in late adolescence/early adulthood predict lifetime childlessness and number of children? Research on this question has been only tangentially relevant and the results inconsistent. The designs used to date have been compromised by genetic and environmental confounds that are poorly controlled; covariate effects of smoking and education that are often ignored; males being understudied; population-based sampling rare, and long-term prospective studies with genetically informative designs yet to be reported.\nIn a 33-year follow-up, we linked the drinking patterns of >3500 Finnish twin pairs, assessed at ages 18-25, to registry data on their eventual number of children. Analyses distinguished associations of early drinking patterns with lifetime childlessness from those predictive of family size. Within-twin pair analyses used fixed-effects regression models to account for shared familial confounds and genetic liabilities. Childlessness was analyzed with Cox proportional hazards models and family size with Poisson regression. Analyses within-pairs and of twins as individuals were run before and after adjustment for smoking and education, and for oral contraceptive (OC) use in individual-level analyses of female twins.\nBaseline abstinence and heavier drinking both significantly predicted lifetime childlessness in individual-level analyses. Few abstinent women used OCs, but they were nonetheless more often eventually childless; adjusting for smoking and education did not affect this finding. Excluding childless twins, Poisson models of family size showed heavier drinking at 18-25 to be predictive of fewer children in both men and women. Those associations were replicated in within-pair analyses of dizygotic twins, each level of heavier drinking being associated with smaller families. Among monozygotic twins, associations of drinking with completed family size yielded effects of similar magnitude, reaching significance at the highest levels of consumption, ruling out familial confounds.\nCompared to moderate levels of drinking, both abstinence and heavier drinking in late adolescence/early adulthood predicted a greater likelihood of lifetime childlessness and eventual number of children. Familial confounds do not fully explain these associations.",

    "abstract": "This study was developed to evaluate the relative placental characteristics and pregnancy outcomes associated with monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins with and without proximate umbilical cord insertion (PCI).\nAll MCDA twins delivered with complete placentas for whom placental characteristics were assessed via dye injection between April 1, 2013 and April 1, 2021 were included in the present cohort study. Cases were separated into PCI and non-PCI groups, and pregnancy outcomes and placental characteristics were then compared between these groups.\nBirthweight discordance rates were significantly lower in the PCI group relative to the non-PCI group (7.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.5% vs 29.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.8%, P\uff1c0.001), while relative to the non-PCI group, rates of artery-artery (AA), vein-vein (VV), thick AA, and thick VV anastomoses were significantly higher in the PCI group (95.5% vs 67.0%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.008, 59.1% vs 16.4, P\uff1c0.001,90.5% vs 34.9%, P\uff1c0.001, 54.5% vs 10.5%, P\uff1c0.001). Significantly more anastomoses were observed in the PCI group (7 (3,11) vs 6 (3,15), P\u00a0=\u00a00.015), and they were significantly larger on average than those in the non-PCI group 12.8 (6.7,21.3) mm vs 11.9 (3.4, 24.6) mm, P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). Significantly lower placental territory discordance and UCI ratios were evident in the PCI group relative to the non-PCI group (23.5 (15.0,51.0) % vs 60.0 (2.0,80.0) %, P\uff1c0.001, 13.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.8% vs 56.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.0%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Marginal cord insertion rates were lower in the PCI group relative to the non-PCI group (13.6% vs 77.5%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nThe placental structure of MCDA twins with PCI is distinct from that of twins without PCI, and these results suggest PCI may be indicative of the more even distribution of placental territory between MCDA fetuses.",

He reported significant eye rubbing using his knuckles during his night-shift work as an emergency doctor. His usual sleeping position on the left side corresponded to the most affected eye. Twin two had normal corneas, with no evidence of KC. He reported mild infrequent eye rubbing, daytime work pattern, and a supine sleeping position. This case report highlights the influence of environmental and behavioural factors in the development of KC, in particular eye rubbing, night work, and sleeping position, in two individuals sharing identical genetic inheritance.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the heritability of dental cephalometric variables by analyzing vertical linear measurements and angular measurements of the upper incisor, canine, and first molar.\nAmong the 553 Korean patients who participated in twin studies conducted at Samsung Medical Center, 150 patients had their lateral cephalometric radiograph data included in this study. The group was comprised of 36 monozygotic (MZ) twins (males, 16 pairs; females, 20 pairs), 13 dizygotic (DZ) twins (males, 7 pairs; females, 6 pairs), and 26 same-sex sibling pairs (males, 11 pairs; females, 15 pairs). All patients were over 20\u00a0years old with a mean age of 39.75\u00a0years. Lateral cephalometric diagrams and linear measurements (6 vertical factors, 6 horizontal factors) were taken. Three axial planes were measured for each tooth; intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were obtained for each group and heritability was calculated using Falconer's method.\nICCs of vertical linear measurements (average 0.837, P\u2009<\u20090.01) and the tooth axis of the central incisor and canine (average 0.679, P\u2009<\u20090.001) were higher in the MZ group compared to the DZ and sibling groups; thus, these variables showed high heritability.\nOrthodontic treatment aiming to alter the tooth axis of the maxillary central incisor or canine or other vertical factors with greater heritability can be difficult, requiring strategic treatment planning to achieve desired treatment outcome and stability.\nThe active early treatment to gain tooth eruption space can lead to normal tooth position.",

    "abstract": "There is a significant concordance of autism spectrum disorder in monozygotic (MZ) twins, where behavioral manifestations are heavily influenced by genetic factors. We describe a case of male monozygotic twins with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), raised in the same household, that present with different\u00a0clinical manifestations. One of the twins presents with intermittent frank syncopal episodes, sinus bradycardia, and elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP), while the other has symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), normal cardiological findings, and normal ALP level. The clinical discordance in this pair of monozygotic twins may be due to any of the following: 1) neuroanatomic cerebellar differences, 2) variable expression of genotype, and 3) inconsistent neurotransmitter regulation.",

We herein report cases of nephronophthisis in a pair of dizygotic twins with different clinical courses. The brother developed end-stage kidney disease at 17 years old; however, his sister did not show kidney insufficiency. Kidney biopsies revealed severe tubulointerstitial damage at 14 and 22 years old in the brother and sister, respectively. Both had a homozygous NPHP1 deletion with different heterozygous mutations related to hereditary cystic kidney disease. Since the dizygotic twins were exposed to similar environmental factors, genetic factors may have influenced their clinical course more strongly than environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "First, to evaluate the risks of stillbirth and neonatal death by gestational age in twin pregnancies with different levels of growth discordance and in relation to small for gestational age (SGA), and on this basis to establish optimal gestational ages for delivery. Second, to compare these optimal gestational ages with previously established optimal delivery timing for twin pregnancies not complicated by fetal growth restriction, which, in a previous individual patient meta-analysis, was calculated at 37 0/7 weeks of gestation for dichorionic pregnancies and 36 0/7 weeks for monochorionic pregnancies.\nA search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Ovid between 2015 and 2018 was performed of cohort studies reporting risks of stillbirth and neonatal death in twin pregnancies from 32 to 41 weeks of gestation. Studies from a previous meta-analysis using a similar search strategy (from inception to 2015) were combined. Women with monoamniotic twin pregnancies were excluded.\nOverall, of 57 eligible studies, 20 cohort studies that contributed original data reporting on 7,474 dichorionic and 2,281 monochorionic twin pairs.\nWe performed an individual participant data meta-analysis to calculate the risk of perinatal death (risk difference between prospective stillbirth and neonatal death) per gestational week. Analyses were stratified by chorionicity, levels of growth discordance, and presence of SGA in one or both twins. For both dichorionic and monochorionic twins, the absolute risks of stillbirth and neonatal death were higher when one or both twins were SGA and increased with greater levels of growth discordance. Regardless of level of growth discordance and birth weight, perinatal risk balanced between 36 0/7-6/7 and 37 0/7-6/7 weeks of gestation in both dichorionic and monochorionic twin pregnancies, with likely higher risk of stillbirth than neonatal death from 37 0/7-6/7 weeks onward.\nGrowth discordance or SGA is associated with higher absolute risks of stillbirth and neonatal death. However, balancing these two risks, we did not find evidence that the optimal timing of delivery is changed by the presence of growth disorders alone.\nPROSPERO, CRD42018090866.",

    "abstract": "In monochorionic twin pregnancies, the fetuses share a single placenta. When this placenta is unequally shared, a discordant antenatal growth pattern ensues resulting in high rates of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Understanding placental pathophysiology is paramount in devising feasible antenatal management strategies. Unequal placental sharing is not the sole determinant of birthweight discordance as there is no one-to-one relationship with placental share discordance. Placental angioarchitecture, especially the presence of large bidirectional anastomoses, is thought to affect this relationship by allowing for a compensatory intertwin blood flow.\nThis study aimed to assess whether placental angioarchitecture can affect birthweight discordance in live-born monochorionic twins, the aim of our study was 2-fold: (1) to assess the relationship between birthweight discordance and placental share discordance and (2) to examine to what extent large bidirectional anastomoses can compensate for the effect of unequal placental sharing on birthweight discordance, with a subgroup analysis for umbilical artery Doppler flow patterns in cases with a birthweight discordance of \u226520%.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study that included monochorionic twin pregnancies observed in our center between March 2002 and June 2021, in which twins with a birthweight discordance of \u226520% were classified according to umbilical artery Doppler flow patterns of the smaller twin. We excluded cases with twin-twin transfusion syndrome and twin anemia polycythemia sequence. Monochorionic placentas of live-born twins were injected with dye, and images were saved for computer measurements of placental sharing and the diameter of anastomoses. Univariate linear regressions of the relationship between placental share discordance and birthweight discordance (both calculated as larger weight or share-smaller weight or share/larger weight or share\u00d7100%) and the relationship between arterioarterial and venovenous diameters and birthweight ratio/placental territory ratio were performed.\nA total of 449 placentas were included in the analysis. Placental share discordance was positively correlated with birthweight discordance (\u03b2 coefficient, 0.325; 95% confidence interval, 0.254-0.397; P<.0001). The arterioarterial diameter was negatively correlated with birthweight ratio/placental territory ratio (\u03b2 coefficient,\u00a0-0.041; 95% confidence interval,\u00a0-0.059 to\u00a0-0.023; P<.0001), meaning that an increase in arterioarterial diameter leads to less birthweight discordance than expected for the amount of placental share discordance. There was no relationship between venovenous diameter and birthweight ratio/placental territory ratio (\u03b2 coefficient,\u00a0-0.007; 95% confidence interval,\u00a0-0.027 to 0.012; P=.473).\nBirthweight discordance in monochorionic twins was strongly associated with placental share discordance. Large arterioarterial anastomoses can mitigate the effect of unequal placental sharing.",

    "abstract": "Macrosomia in singleton pregnancies and associated risks have been well characterized. Less is known about the outcomes of macrosomic newborns in twin pregnancy.Objective of this study was to compare maternal characteristics and perinatal outcomes of \"growth promoted twins\" (twin pairs with a total twin birth weight above 90th percentile) to \"normally grown twins\" (twin pairs with a total twin birth weight between 50th and 90th percentile).\nWe evaluated data (maternal characteristics and perinatal outcomes) of dichorionic-diamniotic twins born at 34 weeks of gestational age or later over a sixteen-year period (2002-2018) in two birth weight groups. We excluded twin pairs born before 34th week of gestation and discordant twin pairs. We used data from the Slovenian National Perinatal Information System.To define the percentiles, twin-specific growth curves have been used.\nOur study population consisted of 390 twin pregnancies with a twin total birth weight over 90th percentile and 1618 pregnancies with a total twin birth weight between 50th and 90th percentile for gestational age. Women in \"growth promoted\" twin group were significantly taller, heavier and more often multiparous. There was a higher incidence of gestational diabetes (10.8% vs 7.3%, OR 1.53 95% CI 1.06 - 2.22), a lower rate of caesarean births (48.2% vs 53.9%, OR 0.80 CI 0.64 - 0.99) and lower rate of assisted reproduction (21.0% vs 27.1%, OR 0.71 CI 0.55 - 0.93) in women in \"growth promoted\" twin group. There were no statistically significant differences in neonatal outcomes in both groups.\nIn contrast to macrosomia in singletons, macrosomia in twins does not appear to increase the risk for adverse perinatal outcomes.",

We aimed to study the differences in placental pathology, in relation to fetal sex, in DCDA twin gestations complicated with growth discordancy.\nThe medical files of all DCDA twin deliveries complicated by growth discordancy between 2010 and 2020 were reviewed. Growth discordance was defined as a gap between twin birthweights\u00a0>\u00a020%. A comparison was made between female vs. male growth discordant twins. Placental lesions were classified as lesions related to maternal or fetal malperfusion lesions (MVM, FVM), vascular and villous changes, and inflammatory lesions.\nIncluded 174 DCDA twins. Eighty-eight were in the discordant female group and eighty-six in the discordant male group. The groups did not differ in maternal demographics, pregnancy characteristics, and neonatal outcome. The discordant male group had a higher rate of placental MVM lesions as compared to the discordant female group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). The increased rate of placental MVM lesions in the discordant male group compared to the discordant female group did not change whether its co-twin was of similar or opposite sex.\nHigher rate of MVM lesions characterizes growth discordant male neonates in DCDA twin gestations. This finding could represent a different adaptation of male fetuses to a hostile intrauterine environment.",

Mutations in anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) and AMH receptor type II (AMHR2) genes have been identified as causative. However, functional experimental analysis of AMHR2 or AMH variants that cause PMDS is still lacking.\nA Chinese Han family affected by PMDS was identified. To assess the history and clinical manifestations of PMDS, physical, operational, ultrasonographical, pathological, and other examinations were performed on family members. The variant screening was conducted using trio whole-exome sequencing (trio WES) and Sanger sequencing. Complementation-based NanoLuciferase Binary Technology (NanoBiT) was used to examine the interaction between AMH and AMHR2 variants in vivo. The effect of the two variants on the transcriptional activity of the TGF\u03b2/BMP pathway was evaluated using a luciferase assay.\nClassic phenotypic manifestations of PMDS in a pair of identical twins were described and confirmed by genetic sequence analysis. Molecular studies revealed two novel variants c.118G\u2009>\u2009C [p.(Gly40Arg)], c.1222G\u2009>\u2009C [p.(Ala408Pro)] in the AMHR2 gene. The AMHR2 p.Gly40Arg variant reduces its ability to bind to AMH, while the p.Ala408Pro variant alters the kinase domain structure. Both variants significantly reduce TGF\u03b2/BMP signaling.\nTwo missense AMHR2 variants associated with PMDS were identified. These findings provide novel insights toward better clinical evaluation and further understanding of the molecular basis of PMDS.",

    "abstract": "Although all the technical components supporting fully orchestrated Digital Twins (DT) currently exist, what remains missing is a conceptual clarification and analysis of a more generalized concept of a DT that is made FAIR, that is, universally machine actionable. This methodological overview is a first step toward this clarification. We present a review of previously developed semantic artifacts and how they may be used to compose a higher-order data model referred to here as a FAIR Digital Twin (FDT). We propose an architectural design to compose, store and reuse FDTs supporting data intensive research, with emphasis on privacy by design and their use in GDPR compliant open science.",

    "abstract": "The Environmental Noise Directive (2002/49/EC) requires all European Union Member States to produce strategic noise maps using a common assessment methodology: CNOSSOS-EU. The reliability of CNOSSOS-EU railway noise evaluation is dependent on the input vehicle and track transfer functions. The CNOSSOS-EU default database contains the currently available choices for these transfer functions. However, these available transfer functions are limited and of insufficient quality, resulting in large errors in noise level calculations. An approach is presented, introducing an established analytical railway rolling noise calculation technique (TWINS), to extract more reliable and specific transfer functions. A case study consisting of railway rolling noise mitigation measures is defined and used as the basis for extracting and testing these transfer functions. The extracted transfer functions reduce the average deviation between CNOSSOS-EU and reference calculations using TWINS from 6.1 dB(A) to 0.8 dB(A) in absolute sound power levels, and from 1.2 db(A) to 0.3 dB(A) in estimates of noise reduction potential for the defined mitigation measures. Application of this approach shows potential to improve the quality and depth of the existing CNOSSOS-EU default database. This may lead to more reliable estimations of railway noise in the strategic noise maps and the subsequent assessment of its harmful effects.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid hormones are associated with birth weight in singleton pregnancy. Twin pregnancies need more thyroid hormones to maintain the normal growth and development of the fetuses compared with single pregnancy.\nWe aimed to investigate the association of thyroid hormones and birth weight in twins.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study in a Chinese population. Pregnant women who received regular antenatal health care and delivered live-born twins from 2014 to 2019 were included (n\u2005=\u20051626). Linear mixed model with restricted cubic splines and logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of thyroid hormones with birth weight and birth weight discordance in twins.\nWe observed that both thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) were not associated with birth weight in twins overall, while when stratifying on fetal sex or chorionicity, there were nonlinear association between FT4 levels and birth weight in boys (Pnonlinear\u2005<\u2005.001) and in dichorionic (DC) twins (Pnonlinear\u2005=\u20050.03). Women with levels of FT4 lower than the 10th percentile had a higher risk of birth weight discordance in their offspring than women with normal FT4 levels (range, 2.5 to 97.5 percentiles) (odds ratio\u2005=\u20051.58; 95% CI, 1.05-2.33).\nOur study suggests there was an association of FT4, but not TSH, with birth weight and birth weight discordance varied by sex and chorionicity. These findings could have implications for obstetricians to be aware of the importance of FT4 levels in preventing birth weight discordance in twin pregnancy.",

Differential effects of COVID-19 in a twin pregnancy may provide unique insights into virus-placental interactions. We present a case of perinatal loss of a female fetus with survival of the male co-twin in a pregnancy complicated by COVID-19 and premature delivery.\nViral detection methods recommended by the NICHD task force were used to identify SARS-CoV-2 and its viral receptors in the placentas and fetal tissue (Antoun et al., 2020) [1] RESULTS: Compared with the surviving twin, we found a more severe intervillous necrosis and a relatively low detection of ACE2 membranous expression in the syncytiotrophoblasts of the female twin that succumbed.\nThe interactions of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 at the maternal fetal interface within the placenta may play a significant role in perinatal loss, and the effects of fetal sex and gestational age at time of infection need to be explored further.",

    "abstract": "The latency between acquisition of an initiating somatic driver mutation by a single-cell and clinical presentation with cancer is largely unknown. We describe a remarkable case of monozygotic twins presenting with CALR mutation-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) (aged 37 and 38 years), with a clinical phenotype of primary myelofibrosis. The CALR mutation was absent in T cells and dermal fibroblasts, confirming somatic acquisition. Whole-genome sequencing lineage tracing revealed a common clonal origin of the CALR-mutant MPN clone, which occurred in utero followed by twin-to-twin transplacental transmission and subsequent similar disease latency. Index sorting and single-colony genotyping revealed phenotypic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) as the likely MPN-propagating cell. Furthermore, neonatal blood spot analysis confirmed in utero origin of the JAK2V617F mutation in a patient presenting with polycythemia vera (aged 34 years). These findings provide a unique window into the prolonged evolutionary dynamics of MPNs and fitness advantage exerted by MPN-associated driver mutations in HSCs.",

    "abstract": "Digital Twins (DTs), virtual copies of physical entities, are a promising tool to help manage and predict outbreaks of Covid-19. By providing a detailed model of each patient, DTs can be used to determine what method of care will be most effective for that individual. The improvement in patient experience and care delivery will help to reduce demand on healthcare services and to improve hospital management.\nThe aim of this study is to address 2 research questions: (1) How effective are DTs in predicting and managing infectious diseases such as Covid-19? and (2) What are the prospects and challenges associated with the use of DTs in healthcare?\nThe review was structured according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) framework. Titles and abstracts of references in PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar were searched using selected keywords (relating to digital twins, healthcare and Covid-19). The papers were screened in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria so that all papers published in English relating to the use of digital twins in healthcare were included. A narrative synthesis was used to analyse the included papers.\nEighteen papers met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. None of the included papers examined the use of DTs in the context of Covid-19, or infectious disease outbreaks in general. Academic research about the applications, opportunities and challenges of DT technology in healthcare in general was found to be in early stages.\nThe review identifies a need for further research into the use of DTs in healthcare, particularly in the context of infectious disease outbreaks. Based on frameworks identified during the review, this paper presents a preliminary conceptual framework for the use of DTs for hospital management during the Covid-19 outbreak to address this research gap.",

    "abstract": "Although the establishment, maintenance and reactivation from alphaherpesvirus latency is far from fully understood, some things are now manifestly clear: Alphaherpesvirus latency occurs in neurons of the peripheral nervous system and control of the process is multifactorial and complex. This includes components of the immune system, contributions from non-neuronal cells surrounding neurons in ganglia, specialized nucleic acids and modifications to the viral DNA to name some of the most important. Efficacious vaccines have been developed to control both acute varicella and zoster, the outcome of reactivation, but despite considerable effort vaccines for acute herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection or reactivated lesions have thus far failed to materialize despite considerable effort. Given the relevance of the immune system to establish and maintain HSV latency, a vaccine designed to tailor the HSV response to maximize the activity of components most critical for controlling reactivated infection might limit the severity of recurrences and hence reduce viral transmission. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of immunological factors that contribute to HSV and VZV latency, identify differences between varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and HSV that could explain why vaccines have been valuable at controlling VZV disease but not HSV, and finish by outlining possible strategies for developing effective HSV vaccines.",

    "abstract": "In the literature, deletions in the 2p16.3 region of the neurexin gene (NRXN1) are associated with cognitive impairment, and other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism, and Pitt-Hopkins-like syndrome 2. In this paper, we present twins with deletion 2p16.3 of the NRXN1 gene using a comparative genomic hybridization array. The two children had a dual diagnosis consisting of mild cognitive impairment and neurodevelopmental delay. Furthermore, they showed a dysmorphic phenotype characterized by facio-cranial disproportion, turricephalus, macrocrania, macrosomia, strabismus, and abnormal conformation of both auricles with low implantation. The genetic analysis of the family members showed the presence, in the father's genetic test, of a microdeletion of the short arm of chromosome 2, in the 2p16.3 region. Our case report can expand the knowledge on the genotype-phenotype association in carriers of 2p16.3 deletion and for genetic counseling that could help in the prevention and eventual treatment of this genetic condition. Newborn carriers should undergo neurobehavioral follow-ups for timely detection of warning signs.",

    "abstract": "Multimorbidity, which is associated with significant negative outcomes for individuals and health care systems, is increasing in the United Kingdom. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the risk factors (including health, behavior, and environment) for multimorbidity over time. An interdisciplinary approach is essential, as data science, artificial intelligence, and engineering concepts (digital twins) can identify key risk factors throughout the life course, potentially enabling personalized simulation of life-course risk for the development of multimorbidity. Predicting the risk of developing clusters of health conditions before they occur would add clinical value by enabling targeted early preventive interventions, advancing personalized care to improve outcomes, and reducing the burden on health care systems.\nThis study aims to identify key risk factors that predict multimorbidity throughout the life course by developing an intelligent agent using digital twins so that early interventions can be delivered to improve health outcomes. The objectives of this study are to identify key predictors of lifetime risk of multimorbidity, create a series of simulated computational digital twins that predict risk levels for specific clusters of factors, and test the feasibility of the system.\nThis study will use machine learning to develop digital twins by identifying key risk factors throughout the life course that predict the risk of later multimorbidity. The first stage of the development will be the training of a base predictive model. Data from the National Child Development Study, the North West London Integrated Care Record, the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, and Cerner's Real World Data will be split into subsets for training and validation, which will be done following the k-fold cross-validation procedure and assessed with the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). In addition, 2 data sets-the Early-Life Data Cross-linkage in Research study and the Children and Young People's Health Partnership randomized controlled trial-will be used to develop a series of digital twin personas that simulate clusters of factors to predict different risk levels of developing multimorbidity.\nThe expected results are a validated model, a series of digital twin personas, and a proof-of-concept assessment.\nDigital twins could provide an individualized early warning system that predicts the risk of future health conditions and recommends the most effective intervention to minimize that risk. These insights could significantly improve an individual's quality of life and healthy life expectancy and reduce population-level health burdens.\nPRR1-10.2196/35738.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional changes involved in neuronal recovery after sports-related concussion (SRC) may be obscured by inter-individual variation in mRNA expression and nonspecific changes related to physical exertion. Using a co-twin study, the objective of this study was to identify important differences in mRNA expression among a single pair of monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for concussion. A pair of MZ twins were enrolled as part of a larger study of concussion biomarkers among collegiate athletes. During the study, Twin A sustained SRC, allowing comparison of mRNA expression to the nonconcussed Twin B. Twin A clinically recovered by Day 7. mRNA expression was measured pre-injury and at 6 h and 7 days postinjury using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray. Changes in mRNA expression from pre-injury to each postinjury time point were compared between the twins; differences >1.5-fold were considered important. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes identified biologic networks associated with important transcripts. Among 38,000 analyzed genes, important changes were identified in 153 genes. The ErbB (epidermal growth factor receptor) signaling pathway was identified as the top transcriptional network from pre-injury to 7 days postinjury. Genes in this pathway with important transcriptional changes included epidermal growth factor (2.41), epiregulin (1.73), neuregulin 1 (1.54) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (1.51). In conclusion, the ErbB signaling pathway was identified as a potential regulator of clinical recovery in a MZ twin pair discordant for SRC. A co-twin study design may be a useful method for identifying important gene pathways associated with concussion recovery.",

    "abstract": "The development of Digital Twins has enabled them to be widely applied to various fields represented by intelligent manufacturing. A Metaverse, which is parallel to the physical world, needs mature and secure Digital Twins technology in addition to Parallel Intelligence to enable it to evolve autonomously. We propose that Blockchain combined with other areas does not simultaneously require all of the basic elements. We extract the immutable characteristics of Blockchain and propose a secure multidimensional data storage solution called BlockNet that can ensure the security of the digital mapping process of the Internet of Things, thereby improving the data reliability of Digital Twins. Additionally, to address some of the challenges faced by multiscale spatial data processing, we propose a nonmutagenic multidimensional Hash Geocoding method, allowing unique indexing of multidimensional information and avoiding information loss due to data dimensionality reduction while improving the efficiency of information retrieval and facilitating the implementation of the Metaverse through spatial Digital Twins based on these two studies.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins employ mathematical and computational models to virtually represent a physical object (e.g., planes and human organs), predict the behavior of the object, and enable decision-making to optimize the future behavior of the object. While digital twins have been widely used in engineering for decades, their applications to oncology are only just emerging. Due to advances in experimental techniques quantitatively characterizing cancer, as well as advances in the mathematical and computational sciences, the notion of building and applying digital twins to understand tumor dynamics and personalize the care of cancer patients has been increasingly appreciated. In this review, we present the opportunities and challenges of applying digital twins in clinical oncology, with a particular focus on integrating medical imaging with mechanism-based, tissue-scale mathematical modeling. Specifically, we first introduce the general digital twin framework and then illustrate existing applications of image-guided digital twins in healthcare. Next, we detail both the imaging and modeling techniques that provide practical opportunities to build patient-specific digital twins for oncology. We then describe the current challenges and limitations in developing image-guided, mechanism-based digital twins for oncology along with potential solutions. We conclude by outlining five fundamental questions that can serve as a roadmap when designing and building a practical digital twin for oncology and attempt to provide answers for a specific application to brain cancer. We hope that this contribution provides motivation for the imaging science, oncology, and computational communities to develop practical digital twin technologies to improve the care of patients battling cancer.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins, customized simulation models pioneered in industry, are beginning to be deployed in medicine and healthcare, with some major successes, for instance in cardiovascular diagnostics and in insulin pump control. Personalized computational models are also assisting in applications ranging from drug development to treatment optimization. More advanced medical digital twins will be essential to making precision medicine a reality. Because the immune system plays an important role in such a wide range of diseases and health conditions, from fighting pathogens to autoimmune disorders, digital twins of the immune system will have an especially high impact. However, their development presents major challenges, stemming from the inherent complexity of the immune system and the difficulty of measuring many aspects of a patient's immune state in vivo. This perspective outlines a roadmap for meeting these challenges and building a prototype of an immune digital twin. It is structured as a four-stage process that proceeds from a specification of a concrete use case to model constructions, personalization, and continued improvement.",

    "abstract": "To review the possible options for digital twin technology in surgery, as well as to build a patent and publication landscape for identifying technological and academic leaders of the frontier.\nScientometric and patent analysis was performed.\nPossible options for digital twin technology in surgical practice were reviewed. Development of scientific and technological trend \u00abdigital twins in surgery\u00bb in the world was assessed (2002 - idea, concept, definition; 2007-2014 - large-scale studies in academic sector; 2014 - active participation of regulators in translation of pilot digital models of patient organs into practical healthcare; 2014-2017 - large-scale studies in business sector; 2018-2021 - development of a market of medical services based on digital twin technologies in surgery). According to scientometric and patent analysis of digital twins in surgery, there is no a single Russian-language article on to this issue in journals indexed in WOS at the end of 2021. Our country ranks the 23\nOver a 20-year period, large-scale scientific projects have been carried out in the world to develop digital twin algorithms for surgery. Regulators were involved in the process of broadcasting their results into practical health care. Network interaction of all authors and beneficiaries of technological frontier occurred (research centers, hospitals, companies, manufacturers of medical equipment and information services). Technological ecosystems developed (startups, gazelles, investment seed capital). Technological leaders and key players in new market niches have been identified. Development of this field is insufficient in the Russian Federation. There are no qualified customers and companies in the real sector of economy that could become the beneficiaries of the frontier.\n\u0412 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435 2021 \u0433. \u0432

Regulators were involved in the process of broadcasting their results into practical health care. Network interaction of all authors and beneficiaries of technological frontier occurred (research centers, hospitals, companies, manufacturers of medical equipment and information services). Technological ecosystems developed (startups, gazelles, investment seed capital). Technological leaders and key players in new market niches have been identified. Development of this field is insufficient in the Russian Federation. There are no qualified customers and companies in the real sector of economy that could become the beneficiaries of the frontier.",

    "abstract": "Twin research proceeds at a rapid pace, with new findings constantly modifying our knowledge and thoughts about many issues. In the present article, this concept is applied to the writing of books and articles about twins, with special emphasis on the author's recent experience. My lead essay in most contributions to the News, Views and Comment section of this journal is usually followed by a review of current research findings; however, significant events necessitated a departure from this format. At this time, it is important to both honor and remember colleagues and twins, both past and present. The final entry in this article highlights media events that variously pose biological and social implications for our field. They include the hardships of Ukrainian twins during wartime; twins born in different years; identical twin surrogacy, a quaternary family and abducted twins in Serbia.",

    "abstract": "Steel syndrome (MIM# 615155) is an autosomal recessive skeletal disorder, characterized by dislocations of the hips and radial heads, carpal coalition, short stature, facial dysmorphism, and scoliosis. Until date 47 patients have been reported. However, disease causing variants have been identified only in twenty Puerto Rican and nine non-Puerto Rican families. Here we report two monozygotic twins and a boy from two families with novel missense variants, c.295G\u00a0>\u00a0A p.(Ala99\u00a0Thr), c.3056C\u00a0>\u00a0A p.(Pro1019His) and c.2521G\u00a0>\u00a0A p.(Gly841Arg) in COL27A1. We describe for the first time, cleft palate and delayed carpal bone ossification as features of Steel syndrome. We reviewed clinical features in all mutation-proven Steel syndrome patients. Short stature and dislocation/subluxation of hip joint are consistently observed. Other features include dislocated radial heads, scoliosis, lordosis, carpal coalition, facial dysmorphism, hearing loss, bilateral fifth finger clinodactyly, knee deformities and developmental delay. Seven missense variants and eight null variants are reported in COL27A1 until date. We also looked into the genotype-phenotype correlation in Puerto Rican and non-Puerto Rican patients.",

    "abstract": "Heteropagus twinning (HT) is a rare anomaly. Six new cases along with a systematic review are described.\nSix cases of HT managed at two tertiary care teaching hospitals over the last 26\u00a0years are described. A PubMed search with words: Heteropagus AND/ OR parasitic twins from 2001 to 2021 hit 183 articles. 36 were added from non-PubMed sources. Finally, 120 cases including 114 from 69 articles and 6 new cases were analysed.\nOf the new cases, 2/6 had an antenatal diagnosis. Five were males. 4 autosites had omphaloceles. Split notochord and 2 parasites attached to a single autosite were encountered. 5/6 autosites survived. On systematic review, the most frequent variant seen was rachipagus (n\u2009=\u200950) followed by omphalopagus (n\u2009=\u200946). Limbs were reported in 75 cases. Congenital heart disease was seen in 17/120(14.2%) autosites. Omphalocele and meningomyelocele were the most common extracardiac anomalies in autosites. Weight along with the anatomy and position of heteropagus twins was a better determinant of the mode of delivery than weight alone. Mortality was reported in 12 cases.\nAutosites in HT generally carry a good prognosis, however, final outcome depends mainly on associated major cardiac anomalies. Meticulous antenatal assessment and preoperative planning are of paramount importance.\nIV.",

On systematic review, the most frequent variant seen was rachipagus (n\u2009=\u200950) followed by omphalopagus (n\u2009=\u200946). Limbs were reported in 75 cases. Congenital heart disease was seen in 17/120(14.2%) autosites. Omphalocele and meningomyelocele were the most common extracardiac anomalies in autosites. Weight along with the anatomy and position of heteropagus twins was a better determinant of the mode of delivery than weight alone. Mortality was reported in 12 cases.",

    "abstract": "While urban vegetation affects the urban thermal environment directly, the effects of different plant layouts and vegetation cover on urban microclimate regulation are different. This study has applied digital technologies to advance urban environmental research and forestry analysis. With a focus on a coastal city located on the eastern coast of the North Temperate Zone as a study area, this study collected the Landsat archive satellite remote sensing image data covering the study area in 2000-2020 and analyzed the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of vegetation coverage, land surface temperature, and urban heat island (UHI) ratio index. The study results included the following findings: (1) The area of high fractional vegetation cover (FVC) (0.8-1.0) in the study area is increasing. Those areas are located in the mountain forests in the near-coastal area. The lowest temperature was also detected in the mountain area. (2) The distance from the coastline causes a negative correlation between land surface temperature and FVC. The land surface temperature in the regions with a distance of more than 25 km from the coastline decreases obviously with increasing FVC in summer. However, the correlation between the land surface temperature and FVC showed a slight change in the winter period. (3) UHI ratio index decreases along with the area of high FVC (H-FVC) area. The influence of ocean climate on seasons is different, which results in the reduced effect of the H-FVC area and differences in the UHI ratio index. (4) The distance from the coastline should be considered as an important factor in the forestry development planning of the coastal cities.",

    "abstract": "Vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a highly debated topic in the current pandemic situation. Early neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection is rare and generally mild. Long-term data describing symptoms after COVID-19 in premature neonates is scarce.\nTwo premature, monoamniotic neonates were born by cesarean section to a mother 5 days after onset of symptomatic COVID-19. On day three of life both neonates developed hyperthermia, respiratory distress, and hematological changes, of which neutropenia persisted for over 40 days. Nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 turned positive four days after delivery although the neonates were strictly isolated. Both neonates showed nearly identical time courses of ct values.\nOur case report revealed prolonged low absolute neutrophil counts in two preterm neonates with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection that is reasonably assumed to have been transmitted vertically ",

Digital rheometer twins, which are developed here, can significantly reduce the cost, time, and energy required to characterize complex fluids and predict their future behavior. This is made possible by combining two different methods of informing neural networks with the rheological underpinnings of a system, resulting in quantitative recovery of a gel's response to different flow protocols. The platform developed here is general enough that it can be extended to areas well beyond complex fluids modeling.",

    "abstract": "Although sometimes used interchangeably, the present review highlights the important differences between generalized worldviews suspecting conspiracy at play (conspiracy mentality) and specific beliefs about the existence of a certain conspiracy (conspiracy theory). In contrast to measures of beliefs in specific conspiracy theories, those of conspiracy mentality are more stable, less malleable, less skewed in their distribution and less contaminated by other ideological content. These differences have important implications for empirical research and the theorizing of conspiracy beliefs. Building on an analogy of personality traits, we argue that conspiracy mentality is a relatively stable readiness to interpret world events as being caused by plots hatched in secret, whereas specific conspiracy beliefs are then manifest indicators (partially contaminated by other dispositions).",

    "abstract": "Heritability of age at menarche (AAM) in African populations remains largely unknown. A question on AAM was given to 1803 [454 monozygotic (MZ), 823 same-sex dizygotic (DZ), and 526 female members of opposite sex] adolescent twins attending public schools in Lagos State, Nigeria. The age range of the sample was 12-18 years, with a mean (SD) of 14.57 (\u00b11.70) years. The data included 905 missing cases consisting of those who had not experienced menarche and did not recall AAM. Missing values were imputed using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Kaplan-Meier analysis based on the imputed data yielded 13.23 years [95% CI [13.18, 13.28] for the mean and 13.00 years [95% CI [12.96, 13.04] for the median of AAM. Twin correlation and model-fitting analyses were performed on the basis of those who reported AAM (MZ = 82 complete pairs and 38 cotwin missing cases; DZ = 157 complete pairs and 99 cotwin missing cases). Maximum likelihood MZ and DZ twin correlations for AAM were .63 (95% CI [.48, .74]) and .33 (95% CI [.19, .45]) respectively. Model-fitting analyses indicated that 58% (95% CI [46, 67]) of the variance of AAM was associated with additive genetic influences with the remaining variance, 42% (33-54) being due to nonshared environmental influences including measurement error. The heritability estimate found in this study was within the range of those found in Asian and Western twin samples.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this single subject study was to investigate whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to both hemispheres combined with speech therapy can improve language learning in a pair of 5-year-old twins with corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD). The treatment protocol included anodal tDCS with simultaneous speech therapy in one of the participants (T.D.), and sham-tDCS with the same montage, and stimulation regime concomitant with speech therapy for the other twin (A.D.). Our findings show that T.D. improved in language production when treated with speech therapy in combination with tDCS. A.D. showed evidence for a relatively minor behavioral benefit from speech therapy.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to variations in dental dimensions in a sample of Turkish twins, and to estimate heritability using dental casts.\nThe study samples were selected from the twin children between 3-15 years old who referred for their first dental examination. Fifty nine monozygotic and one hundred and forty three dizygotic twin pairs were examined in the study. The alginate impression material used to create the plaster model of maxilla and mandible. Anterior arch width, posterior arch width, arch length and arch circumference were measured on models prepared from measurements taken for both maxilla and mandible with digital caliper. The similarities and differences of the measurements were compared between pairs of twins and zygocytes. Morever, the effects of bad oral habits, bruxism, a result of psychosocial factors on measurements were examined. Statistical analysis was performed using Paired T Test, Wilcoxon Test and Mann Whitney U test.\nA total of 404 dental models of 118 (29.2%) monozygotic and 286 (70.8%) dizygotic twins were evaluated. There was no statistical difference between sibling pairs in both monozygotic and dizygotic twins. The measurement similarity between twin siblings differed according to zygosity in all measurements (p<0.05). It has been observed that the finger sucking and mouth breathing affect the dental arch measurements (p<0.05).\nThese results indicate that the differences in dental arch dimensions between monozygotic twin pairs are less than the difference between dizygotic twin pairs.",

    "abstract": "The present work expects to meet the personalized needs of the continuous development of various products and improve the joint operation of the intraenterprise Production and Distribution (P-D) process. Specifically, this paper studies the enterprise's P-D optimization. Firstly, the P-D linkage operation is analyzed under dynamic interference. Secondly, following a literature review on the difficulties and problems existing in the current P-D logistics linkage, the P-D logistics linkage-oriented decision-making information architecture is established based on Digital Twins. Digital Twins technology is mainly used to accurately map the P-D logistics linkage process's real-time data and dynamic virtual simulation. In addition, the information support foundation is constructed for P-D logistics linkage decision-making and collaborative operation. Thirdly, a Digital Twins-enabled P-D logistics linkage-oriented decision-making mechanism is designed and verified under the dynamic interference in the linkage process. Meanwhile, the lightweight deep learning algorithm is used to optimize the proposed P-D logistics linkage-oriented decision-making model, namely, the Collaborative Optimization (CO) method. Finally, the proposed P-D logistics linkage-oriented decision-making model is applied to a domestic Enterprise H. It is simulated by the Matlab platform using sensitivity analysis. The results show that the production, storage, distribution, punishment, and total costs of linkage operation are 24,943\u2009RMB, 3,393\u2009RMB, 2,167\u2009RMB, 0\u2009RMB, and 30,503\u2009RMB, respectively. The results are 3.7% lower than the nonlinkage operation. The results of sensitivity analysis provide a high reference value for the scientific management of enterprises.",

    "abstract": "Major depression is associated with alterations in the auditory P3 event-related potential (ERP). However, the persistence of these abnormalities after recovery from depressive episodes, especially in young adults, is not well known. Furthermore, the potential influence of substance use on this association is poorly understood. Young adult twin pairs (N\u00a0=\u00a0177) from the longitudinal FinnTwin16 study were studied with a psychiatric interview, and P3a and P3b ERPs elicited by task-irrelevant novel sounds and targets, respectively. Dyadic linear mixed-effect models were used to distinguish the effects of lifetime major depressive disorder from familial factors and effects of alcohol problem drinking and tobacco smoking. P3a amplitude was significantly increased and P3b latency decreased, in individuals with a history of lifetime major depression, when controlling the fixed effects of alcohol abuse, tobacco, gender, twins' birth order, and zygosity. These results suggest that past lifetime major depressive disorder may be associated with enhanced attentional sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies are at increased risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality due to the shared placenta with vascular connections that can give rise to various complications, including twin-twin transfusion syndrome, twin anemia polycythemia sequence (TAPS), selective fetal growth restriction, and other hematological imbalances at birth. Each complication presents its own challenges and considerations in the neonatal period. Measurement of hemoglobin levels and reticulocyte count is required to establish a correct diagnosis. Placenta dye injection is needed to properly distinguish between the various conditions. Risk factors for adverse outcome in MC twins include prematurity, severe cerebral injury, and the type of MC pregnancy complication. We, therefore, recommend cerebral ultrasound examinations in all complicated MC twins at birth to rule out a severe brain injury. Lastly, we strongly encourage screening for hearing loss using automated auditory brainstem response in all spontaneous TAPS donors to prevent permanent speech development delay.",

    "abstract": "Medical digital twins are computational disease models for drug discovery and treatment. Unresolved problems include how to organize and prioritize between disease-associated changes in digital twins, on cellulome- and genome-wide scales. We present a dynamic framework that can be used to model such changes and thereby prioritize upstream regulators (URs) for biomarker- and drug discovery.\nWe started with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) as a disease model, by analyses of in vitro allergen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from SAR patients. Time-series a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of these cells were used to construct multicellular network models (MNMs) at each time point of molecular interactions between cell types. We hypothesized that predicted molecular interactions between cell types in the MNMs could be traced to find an UR gene, at an early time point. We performed bioinformatic and functional studies of the MNMs to develop a scalable framework to prioritize UR genes. This framework was tested on a single-cell and bulk-profiling data from SAR and other inflammatory diseases.\nOur scRNA-seq-based time-series MNMs of SAR showed thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across multiple cell types, which varied between time points. Instead of a single-UR gene in each MNM, we found multiple URs dispersed across the cell types. Thus, at each time point, the MNMs formed multi-directional networks. The absence of linear hierarchies and time-dependent variations in MNMs complicated the prioritization of URs. For example, the expression and functions of Th2 cytokines, which are approved drug targets in allergies, varied across cell types, and time points. Our analyses of bulk- and single-cell data from other inflammatory diseases also revealed multi-directional networks that showed stage-dependent variations. We therefore developed a quantitative approach to prioritize URs: we ranked the URs based on their predicted effects on downstream target cells. Experimental and bioinformatic analyses supported that this kind of ranking is a tractable approach for prioritizing URs.\nWe present a scalable framework for modeling dynamic changes in digital twins, on cellulome- and genome-wide scales, to prioritize UR genes for biomarker and drug discovery.",

    "results": "Our scRNA-seq-based time-series MNMs of SAR showed thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across multiple cell types, which varied between time points. Instead of a single-UR gene in each MNM, we found multiple URs dispersed across the cell types. Thus, at each time point, the MNMs formed multi-directional networks. The absence of linear hierarchies and time-dependent variations in MNMs complicated the prioritization of URs. For example, the expression and functions of Th2 cytokines, which are approved drug targets in allergies, varied across cell types, and time points. Our analyses of bulk- and single-cell data from other inflammatory diseases also revealed multi-directional networks that showed stage-dependent variations. We therefore developed a quantitative approach to prioritize URs: we ranked the URs based on their predicted effects on downstream target cells. Experimental and bioinformatic analyses supported that this kind of ranking is a tractable approach for prioritizing URs.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart defects have been associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes due to factors that result in a hypoxic-ischemic cerebral cumulative effect. We present a pair of fraternal twins: the first twin was healthy, and the second was born with a complex congenital heart defect (CCHD). They were followed for growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes to determine the comparative effect of exposure to a CCHD. Results show that exposure to a CCHD could be related to a persistent motor deficiency with hypotonia and concurrent height for age delay. CCHD requires a comprehensive neurodevelopmental approach; the pathophysiology and the surrounding stimuli are influential.",

    "abstract": "Dietary habits have a profound influence on the metabolic activity of gut microorganisms and their influence on health. Concerns have been raised as to whether the consumption of foodstuffs contaminated with pesticides can contribute to the development of chronic disease by affecting the gut microbiome. We performed the first pesticide biomonitoring survey of the British population, and subsequently used the results to perform the first pesticide association study on gut microbiome composition and function from the TwinsUK registry.\nDietary exposure of 186 common insecticide, herbicide, or fungicide residues and the faecal microbiome in 65 twin pairs in the UK was investigated. We evaluated if dietary habits, geographic location, or the rural/urban environment, are associated with the excretion of pesticide residues. The composition and metabolic activity of faecal microbiota was evaluated using shotgun metagenomics and metabolomics respectively. We performed a targeted urine metabolomics analysis in order to evaluate whether pesticide urinary excretion was also associated with physiological changes.\nPyrethroid and/or organophosphorus insecticide residues were found in all urine samples, while the herbicide glyphosate was found in 53% of individuals. Food frequency questionnaires showed that residues from organophosphates were higher with increased consumption of fruit and vegetables. A total of 34 associations between pesticide residue concentrations and faecal metabolite concentrations were detected. Glyphosate excretion was positively associated with an overall increased bacterial species richness, as well as to fatty acid metabolites and phosphate levels. The insecticide metabolite Br2CA, reflecting deltamethrin exposure, was positively associated with the phytoestrogens enterodiol and enterolactone, and negatively associated with some N-methyl amino acids. Urine metabolomics performed on a subset of samples did not reveal associations with the excretion of pesticide residues.\nThe consumption of conventionally grown fruit and vegetables leads to higher ingestion of pesticides with unknown long-term health consequences. Our results highlight the need for future dietary intervention studies to understand effects of pesticide exposure on the gut microbiome and possible health consequences.",

The insecticide metabolite Br2CA, reflecting deltamethrin exposure, was positively associated with the phytoestrogens enterodiol and enterolactone, and negatively associated with some N-methyl amino acids. Urine metabolomics performed on a subset of samples did not reveal associations with the excretion of pesticide residues.",

    "abstract": "Human gut microbiome composition is influenced by genetics, diet and environmental factors. We investigated the microbial composition in several gastrointestinal (GI) compartments to evaluate the impact of genetics, delivery mode, diet, household sharing and aging on microbial similarity in monozygotic and dizygotic twins.\nFecal, biopsy and saliva samples were obtained from total 108 twins. DNA and/or RNA was extracted and the region V1-V2 of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced. Bray-Curtis similarity was used for further microbiome comparisons, Mann-Whitney test was applied to evaluate the significant differences between groups and Spearman test was applied to reveal potential correlations between data.\nThe global bacterial profiles were grouped into two clusters separating the upper and lower GI. The upper GI microbiome composition was strictly dependent on the Helicobacter pylori status. With a positivity rate of 55%, H. pylori completely colonized the stomach and separated infected twins from non-infected twins irrespective of zygosity status. Lower GI microbiome similarity between the twins was defined mainly by household-sharing and aging; whereas delivery mode and host genetics had no influence. There was a progredient decrease in the bacterial similarity with aging. Shared vs. non-shared phylotypes analysis showed that in both siblings the shared phylotypes progressively diminished with aging, while the non-shared phylotypes increased.\nOur findings strongly highlight the aging and shared household as they key determinants in gut microbial similarity and drift in twins irrespective of their zygotic state.\nThis work was supported by the grant of the Research Council of Lithuania (Project no. APP-2/2016) and also partially supported by the funds of European Commission through the \"European funds for regional development\" (EFRE) as well as by the regional Ministry of Economy, Science and Digitalization as part of the \"LiLife\" Project as part of the \"Autonomy in old Age\" research group (Project ID: ZS/2018/11/95324).",

    "abstract": "Strategic management and production of internal energy in autonomous robots is becoming a research topic with growing importance, especially for platforms that target long-endurance missions, with long-range and duration. It is fundamental for autonomous vehicles to have energy self-generation capability to improve energy autonomy, especially in situations where refueling is not viable, such as an autonomous sailboat in ocean traversing. Hence, the development of energy estimation and management solutions is an important research topic to better optimize the use of available energy supply and generation potential. In this work, we revisit the challenges behind the project design and construction for two fully autonomous sailboats and propose a methodology based on the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in order to find the best way to manage the supplementary energy generated by solar panels. To verify the approach, we introduce a case study with our two developed sailboats that have planned payload with electric and electronics, and one of them is equipped with an electrical engine that may eventually help with the sailboat propulsion. Our current results show that it is possible to augment the system confidence level for the potential energy that can be harvested from the environment and the remaining energy stored, optimizing the energy usage of autonomous vehicles and improving their energy robustness.",

    "abstract": "Observational epidemiological analyses demonstrated a decreased risk of death and severe morbidity associated with caesarean delivery at term but an increased risk at preterm gestational age. A multicentre international randomized controlled compared planned caesarean section with vaginal birth and observed no difference in outcome; however, the trial included preterm and term births in approximately similar proportions. A subsequent re-analysis of the trial demonstrated that planned caesarean section was associated with an increased risk of adverse neonatal outcome at preterm gestational ages, but reduced the risk of perinatal complications at term, consistent with the epidemiological studies. Hence, decision-making around mode of delivery for twins should recommend against routine caesarean delivery preterm. At term, the balance of risks and benefits will vary according to the mother's prioritization of avoiding intervention, her attitude to managing the risks of uncommon but potentially severe adverse events, and her plans and potential for future pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Singleton pregnancy is encouraged to reduce pregnancy complications. In addition to single embryo transfer (SET), selective and spontaneous fetal reduction (SEFR and SPFR) can also achieve singleton pregnancies. After SEFR or SPFR, an inanimate fetus remains in the uterus. It is unclear whether the inanimate fetus would adversely affect another fetus or the mother. Previous studies have focused on the differences between pre- and post-reduction. However, studies focusing on the influence of SEFR and SPFR on the remaining fetal development and maintenance of pregnancy are rare.\nMaterials from 5922 patients whose embryo transfer dates ranged from March 2011 to January 2021 were collected. Both the SEFR group (n\u2009=\u2009390) and SPFR group (n\u2009=\u2009865) had double embryos transferred (DET) and got twin pregnancies, but subsequent selective or spontaneous fetal reduction occurred. The SET group (n\u2009=\u20094667) had only one embryo transferred. All were singleton pregnancies on the 65th day after embryo transfer. Clinical outcomes, including pregnancy outcomes, pregnancy complications, and newborn outcomes, were compared among the three groups.\nAfter adjusting for age, infertility duration, types of infertility, states of embryos, body mass index, and factors affecting SET or DET decisions, multivariate regression analysis revealed that SEFR increased the risk of miscarriage (OR 2.368, 95% CI 1.423-3.939) and preterm birth (OR 1.515, 95% CI 1.114-2.060), and reduced the gestational age (\u03b2eta -0.342, 95% CI -0.544- -0.140). SPFR increased the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (OR 1.657, 95% CI 1.215-2.261), preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) (OR 1.649, 95% CI 1.057-2.574), and abnormal amniotic fluid volume (OR 1.687, 95% CI 1.075-2.648). Both SEFR and SPFR were associated with reduced live birth rate (OR 0.522, 95% CI 0.330-0.825; OR 0.671, 95% CI 0.459-0.981), newborn birth weight (\u03b2eta -177.412, 95% CI -235.115--119.709; \u03b2eta -42.165, 95% CI -83.104--1.226) as well as an increased risk of low-birth-weight newborns (OR 2.222, 95% CI 1.490-3.313; OR 1.510, 95% CI 1.092-2.087).\nDET with subsequent fetal reduction was related to poor clinical outcomes. We recommend that DET with subsequent fetal reduction should only be considered as a rescue method for multiple pregnancy patients with potential complications, and SET is more advisable.",

    "abstract": "Separation of total vertical craniopagus with shared venous sinuses poses multiple challenges. Provision of soft-tissue cover to the exposed brains at the time of total separation is one of them, due to the large size of the defect and paucity of local tissues. Staged separation of twins is advised with partial venous and parenchymal disconnection in the first stage and total separation in the second stage. Tissue expanders are inserted in the first stage, and second stage planned to coincide with the period of adequate expansion. In the child being reported, emergency second stage was done due to the deteriorating general condition of the children. Left with inadequate expanded skin, the critical defect in a twin was managed with bilateral trapezius myocutaneous flaps. High ionotropic support of the postoperative period resulted in superficial necrosis of the flap, which was managed by debridement, allograft application and autograft later. Both twins had well-healed wounds by 3 months.",

    "abstract": "A moderate to high alcohol consumption is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in comparison with low consumption. The mechanisms underlying this association are not clear and have been suggested to be caused by residual confounding. The main objective of this study was to separate the familial and individual risk for CVD mortality and all-cause mortality related to alcohol consumption. This will be done by estimating the risk for CVD mortality and all-cause mortality in twin pairs discordant for alcohol consumption.\nAlcohol consumption was assessed at two time points using self-report questionnaires in the Norwegian Twin Registry. Data on CVD mortality was obtained from the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry. Exposure-outcome associations for all-cause mortality and mortality due to other causes than CVD were estimated for comparison.\nComing from a family with moderate to high alcohol consumption was protective against cardiovascular death (HR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.65-0.83). Moderate and high alcohol consumption levels were associated with a slightly increased risk of CVD mortality at the individual level (HR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.02-1.73). There was no association between alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality both at the familial nor at the individual level.\nThe protective association of moderate to high alcohol consumption with a lower risk of CVD mortality was accounted for by familial factors in this study of twins. Early life genetic and environmental familial factors may mask an absence of health effect of moderate to high alcohol consumption on cardiovascular mortality.",

    "abstract": "The literature on neonatal outcomes in preterm twins delivered before 34 weeks but within and after 14 days of a single initial steroid course is limited.\nThis bidirectional (226 prospective and 42 retrospectives) cohort study was performed at a tertiary care teaching hospital in South India. We compared the respiratory distress syndrome and neonatal death amongst preterm twins from 28 to 34 weeks born < 14 days (Group A, n=268) and after 14 days (Group B, n=268) of completion of a single course of antenatal steroids. We used multivariable regression analysis (log-binomial model) to adjust for confounding variables. We generated a propensity-matched score with probit regression to analyse outcomes (respiratory distress and neonatal deaths).\nThe two groups had significant differences in the distribution of birthweight, gestation period and mode of delivery. On adjusted analysis, the period of gestation below 33 weeks and weight below 1.5 kg had the maximum influence on respiratory and other morbidities, and weight less than 1 kg on neonatal death. [adjusted relative risk (ARR) 26.06, (95%CI=2.37-285.5), p=0.008]. On propensity scoring after matching all these variables, we found an [ARR of 2.0 (95% CI: 1.03-3.88), P=0.017] for neonatal death after 14 days of steroid injection. The ARR for respiratory distress syndrome was 1.13 in those born after 14 days of steroids, though it did not reach statistical significance.\nOn propensity scoring, the steroid-delivery interval more than 14 days was associated with a significantly increased risk (ARR of 2) of neonatal death.",

    "abstract": "The current work aims to strengthen the research of segmentation, detection, and tracking methods of stem cell image in the fields of regenerative medicine and tissue damage restoration. Firstly, based on the relevant theories of stem cell image segmentation, digital twins (DTs), and lightweight deep learning, a new phase contrast microscope is introduced through the research of optical microscope. Secondly, the results of DTs method and phase contrast imaging principle are compared in stem cell image segmentation and detection. Finally, a lightweight deep learning model is introduced in the segmentation and tracking of stem cell image to observe the gray value and mean value before and after stem cell image movement and stem cell division. The results show that phase contrast microscope can increase the phase contrast and amplitude difference of stem cell image and solve the problem of stem cell image segmentation to a certain extent. The detection results of DTs method are compared with phase contrast imaging principle. It indicates that not only can DTs method make the image contour more accurate and clearer, but also its accuracy, recall, and F1 score are 0.038, 0.024, and 0.043 higher than those of the phase contrast imaging method. The lightweight deep learning model is applied to the segmentation and tracking of stem cell image. It is found that the gray value and mean value of stem cell image before and after movement and stem cell division do not change significantly. Hence, the application of DTs and lightweight deep learning methods in the segmentation, detection, and tracking of stem cell image has great reference significance for the development of biology and medicine.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of lip sucking on dentofacial development in a pair of 6.5-year-old monozygotic twins.\nLip sucking, which causes an imbalance in splanchnocraniums soft tissues pressures, can influence the hard tissues development, and contribute to orthodontic anomalies.\nAnalysis of lateral cephalometric X-rays was performed by 9 orthodontists. Data were compared using the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.\nSNA, A-NPog, and Cond-A values suggested an anterior shift of the maxilla. The 1u to SN, 1u to A-Pog, 1u to A-Pog angle, and 1u-Avert values indicated an upper incisor protrusion. While the 1l to A-Pog, 1l to A-Pog angle and 1l to Go-Me values showed a retrusion of the lower incisors, the NL-NSL implied a hard palate rotation counterclockwise. The SNA-Me indicated that the mandible of the lip-sucking patient was in a more inferior position.\nLip sucking can influence the skeletal development of maxilla, the position of upper and lower incisors and the position of mandible. Skeletal development of mandible seems to be unaffected (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 26).",

    "abstract": "Does adolescent attachment to parents and peers differ between singletons and twins born with ART or natural conception (NC)?\nAdolescent attachment anxiety with the father was higher among NC singletons than among ART and NC twins, whereas attachment avoidance with the father was higher in ART singletons than in NC singletons and NC twins. No differences were found in attachment to the mother, best friend or romantic partner.\nMost studies have not found differences between ART and NC singletons in parent-adolescent relationships, but twin relationships may be more at risk. No previous study has examined all four groups in the same study, or specifically looked at attachment relationships.\nThis was an 18-year, prospective and controlled longitudinal study with families of 496 ART singletons, 101 ART twin pairs, 476 NC singletons and 22 NC twin pairs. Families were recruited during the second trimester of pregnancy; the ART group was recruited from five infertility clinics in Finland and the control group was recruited from a hospital outpatient clinic during a routine visit.\nMothers and fathers gave background information for this study during pregnancy, and during the child's first year and early school age (7-8\u2009years). For the ART group, infertility characteristics and prenatal medical information was also obtained from the patient registry of the infertility clinics. Children (originally 50% girls) filled in electronic questionnaires related to their attachment to mother, father, best friend and romantic partner (\nAdolescent attachment anxiety to father was higher in NC singletons than in ART twins, \nThe sample size was small especially in the NC twin group and there was drop-out over the 18-year time period, especially among boys and families with lower parental education level. The study only included native Finnish-speaking families. The results could differ in a more diverse population. ART singletons were younger and had fewer siblings than ART twins and NC children, and ART and NC twins had more newborn health risks than ART and NC singletons.\nThe study adds to a growing body of evidence that neither ART treatments nor being a twin places mother-child relationships or peer relationships at long-term risk. However, in our study, which was the first to examine both ART and twinhood simultaneously, we found that there may be more problems in father-adolescent relationships, but only in ART singletons and only related to attachment avoidance. Our findings suggest that men, as well as women, should receive enough support in pre- and peri-natal health care during and after infertility treatments.\nThis study was funded by Academy of Finland (grant number 2501308988), the Juho Vainio Foundation and the Finnish Cultural Foundation. The authors report no conflict of interest.\nN/A.",

    "abstract": "Keeping appropriate interpersonal distance is an evolutionary conserved behavior that can be adapted based on learning. Detailed knowledge on how interpersonal space is represented in the brain and whether such representation is genetically influenced is lacking. We measured brain function using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 294 twins (71 monozygotic, 76 dizygotic pairs) performing a distance task where neural responses to human figures were compared to cylindrical blocks. Proximal viewing distance of human figures was compared to cylinders facilitated responses in the occipital face area (OFA) and the superficial part of the amygdala, which is consistent with these areas playing a role in monitoring interpersonal distance. Using the classic twin method, we observed a genetic influence on interpersonal distance related activation in the OFA, but not in the amygdala. Results suggest that genetic factors may influence interpersonal distance monitoring via the OFA whereas the amygdala may play a role in experience-dependent adjustments of interpersonal distance.",

    "abstract": "Testicular cancer is the most common neoplasm in men aged 15-45 years old, with several established risk factors such as cryptorchidism, age, and family history. We report a case of a 44-year-old man with a history of cryptorchidism who presented with lesions in his right testis, a large retroperitoneal mass, and diffuse nodal lesions in his lungs. He underwent radical orchiectomy that showed testicular cancer and was immediately inducted into systemic therapy based on bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin. Two weeks later, his monozygotic twin brother, also reporting cryptorchidism at a young age, presented with a painless mass in his left testis. He underwent radical orchiectomy that revealed testicular cancer and received adjuvant chemotherapy. The first patient, after two cycles of chemotherapy, suffered from an episode of massive hematochezia and died while his brother remains relapse-free.",

    "abstract": "Combined AntiRetroviral Treatments (cARTs) used for HIV infection may result in varied metabolic complications, which in some cases, may be related to patient genetic factors, particularly microRNAs. The use of monozygotic twins, differing only for HIV infection, presents a unique and powerful model for the controlled analysis of potential alterations of miRNAs regulation consequent to cART treatment. Profiling of 2578 mature miRNA in the subcutaneous (SC) adipose tissue and plasma of monozygotic twins was investigated by the GeneChip\u00ae miRNA 4.1 array. Real-time PCR and ddPCR experiments were performed in order to validate differentially expressed miRNAs. Target genes of deregulated miRNAs were predicted by the miRDB database (prediction score > 70) and enrichment analysis was carried out with g:Profiler. Processes in SC adipose tissue most greatly affected by miRNA up-regulation included (i) macromolecular metabolic processes, (ii) regulation of neurogenesis, and (iii) protein phosphorylation. Furthermore, KEGG analysis revealed miRNA up-regulation involvement in (i) insulin signaling pathways, (ii) neurotrophin signaling pathways, and (iii) pancreatic cancer. By contrast, miRNA up-regulation in plasma was involved in (i) melanoma, (ii) p53 signaling pathways, and (iii) focal adhesion. Our findings suggest a mechanism that may increase the predisposition of HIV+ patients to insulin resistance and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Maternal and neonatal outcomes of trial of labor after cesarean delivery of twins are similar to those of singleton trials of labor after cesarean delivery. However, previous studies did not stratify outcomes by second-twin presentation on admission to labor.\nTo examine maternal and neonatal outcomes following trial of labor after cesarean delivery in twins with vertex-nonvertex presentation.\nA retrospective multicenter study was conducted including data on deliveries occurring between the years 2005 and 2020. We included trials of labor after a previous cesarean delivery (at \u226532\nA total of 236 twin trials of labor after cesarean delivery were included, of which 128 involved nonvertex second twins and 108 a second vertex twin. Uterine rupture rates were comparable between the groups (1/128 [0.9%] vs 1/108 [0.8%]; P=1.000). Successful trial of labor after cesarean delivery of both twins occurred in 76.6% of the exposed group vs 81.5% of the comparison group, whereas cesarean delivery of both twins was performed in 21.9% of the exposed group vs 17.6% of the comparison group (P=.418; odds ratio, 1.32; confidence interval, 0.7-2.5). Two cases of cesarean delivery of the second twin occurred in the exposed group and 1 in the comparison group (1.6% vs 0.9%, respectively, P=1.000). There was no difference between the groups in maternal outcomes, including rates of postpartum hemorrhage, blood transfusion, placental abruption, thromboembolic events, and maternal fever. Neonatal outcomes were also comparable between the groups, including rates of intensive care admission and low (\u22647) 5-minute Apgar scores.\nOur data show that\u00a0trial of labor after cesarean delivery of noncephalic second twins holds favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes, comparable with those of vertex-vertex trials of labor after cesarean delivery.\u00a0Second-twin noncephalic presentation should not discourage parturients and caregivers from considering trial of labor after cesarean delivery if desired.",

This study aims to determine the combined and relative effects of genetic and intrauterine environments on neonatal microbial communities and to explore selective FGR-induced gut microbiota disruption, metabolic profile disturbances and possible outcomes.\nWe profiled and compared the gut microbial colonisation of 150 pairs of twin neonates who were classified into four groups based on their chorionicity and discordance of fetal birth weight. Gut microbiota dysbiosis and faecal metabolic alterations were determined by 16S ribosomal RNA and metagenomic sequencing and metabolomics, and the long-term effects were explored by surveys of physical and neurocognitive development conducted after 2~3 years of follow-up.\nAdverse intrauterine environmental factors related to selective FGR dominate genetics in their effects of elevating bacterial diversity and altering the composition of early-life gut microbiota, and this effect is positively related to the severity of selective FGR in twins. The influence of genetic factors on gut microbes diminishes in the context of selective FGR. Gut microbiota dysbiosis in twin neonates with selective FGR and faecal metabolic alterations features decreased abundances of \nDysbiotic microbiota profiles and pronounced metabolic alterations are associated with selective FGR affected by adverse intrauterine environments, emphasising the possible effects of dysbiosis on long-term neurobehavioural development.",

    "abstract": "Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are associated with dysfunctional placentation and are a major cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Twin pregnancies have a larger placental mass and are a risk factor for HDP. The effect of HDP on neonatal outcomes in twin pregnancies is unknown.\nRetrospective cohort study using the Canadian Neonatal Network database from 2010-2018 of twin infants &lt;29 weeks gestation born to mothers with HDP and normotensive pregnancies. Using multivariable models, we determined adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe neurologic injury, severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), necrotizing enterocolitis, and nosocomial infection in twin infants of mothers with HDP compared to twin infants of normotensive mothers.\nOf the 2414 eligible twin infants &lt;29 weeks gestational age, 164 (6.8%) were born to mothers with HDP and had higher odds of severe ROP (AOR 2.48, 95% CI 1.34-4.59). Preterm twin infants born to mothers with HDP also had higher odds of mortality (AOR 2.02, 95% CI 1.23-3.32). There was no difference in other outcomes.\nPreterm twin infants &lt;29 weeks gestation of HDP mothers have higher odds of severe ROP and mortality.\nHypertensive disorders of pregnancy, associated with placental dysfunction, are a major cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Twin pregnancy, associated with a larger placental mass, is a risk factor for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The effect of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy on outcomes of preterm twins is unknown. Preterm twins of mothers with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are at higher risk of severe retinopathy of prematurity and mortality. Our data can be used to counsel parents and identify infants at higher risk of severe retinopathy of prematurity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins (DTs) can realize the integration of information and entities. It is widely used because of its simulation characteristics and virtual reality (VR) mapping. Its application to industrial product management and control is explored. First, the concept and the functions in different stages of DTs are expounded. Second, the Workench simulation platform and SolidWorks software are applied in the design of the aluminum alloy flange according to DTs in the design stage of industrial product management and control. Third, the role of DTs in industrial product management and control is confirmed through a comparative experiment. Finally, an intelligent algorithm for the automatic identification of internal defects is designed based on lightweight deep learning to improve the efficiency of ultrasonic detection. The results show that the accuracy of the lightweight convolution neural network (CNN) is 94.1%; the model size is 2.9\u2009MB; the network is more lightweight and has an excellent performance in ultrasonic defect detection; the nonlinear finite element analysis results and the test results are consistent. Therefore, it is proved that the finite element analysis method is reliable and helps to improve the efficiency and shorten the design cycle. The emergence of DTs provides a technical scheme for product management and control under the three-dimensional model.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins of urban drainage systems require simulation models that can adequately replicate the physical system. All models have their limitations, and it is important to investigate when and where simulation results are acceptable and to communicate the level of performance transparently to end users. This paper first defines a classification of four possible 'locations of uncertainty' in integrated urban drainage models. It then develops a structured framework for identifying and diagnosing various types of errors. This framework compares model outputs with in-sewer water level observations based on hydrologic and hydraulic signatures. The approach is applied on a real case study in Odense, Denmark, with examples from three different system sites: a typical manhole, a small flushing chamber, and an internal overflow structure. This allows diagnosing different model errors ranging from issues in the underlying asset database and missing hydrologic processes to limitations in the model software implementation. Structured use of signatures is promising for continuous, iterative improvements of integrated urban drainage models. It also provides a transparent way to communicate the level of model adequacy to end users.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the fetal survival rate and perinatal outcomes of triplet pregnancies after selective reduction to twin pregnancies vs singleton pregnancies.\nPubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase were systematically searched from the inception of the databases to January 16,\u00a02022.\nStudies comparing the survival and perinatal outcomes between reduction to twin pregnancies and reduction to singleton pregnancies were included. The primary outcomes were fetal survival, defined as a live birth at >24 weeks of gestation. The secondary outcomes were gestational age at birth, preterm birth at <32 and <34 weeks of gestation, early pregnancy loss (<24 weeks of gestation), low birthweight, and rate of neonatal demise (up to 28 days after birth).\nThe random-effect model was used to pool the mean differences or odds ratios and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. To provide a range of expected effects if a new study was conducted, 95% prediction intervals were calculated for outcomes presented in >3 studies.\nOf note, 10 studies with 2543 triplet pregnancies undergoing fetal reduction, of which 2035 reduced to twin pregnancies and 508 reduced to singleton pregnancies, met the inclusion criteria. Reduction to twin pregnancies had a lower rate of fetal survival (odds ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.92; P=.02; 95% prediction interval, 0.36-1.03) and comparable rates of early pregnancy loss (odds ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.38; P=.61; 95% prediction interval, 0.54-1.48) and neonatal demise (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-3.50; P=.55) than reduction to singleton pregnancies. Reduction to twin pregnancies had a significantly lower gestation age at birth (weeks) (mean difference,\u00a0-2.20; 95% confidence interval,\u00a0-2.80 to\u00a0-1.61; P<.001; 95% prediction interval,\u00a0-4.27 to\u00a0-0.14) than reduction to singleton pregnancies. Furthermore, reduction to twin pregnancies was associated with lower birthweight and greater risk of preterm birth at <32 and <34 weeks of gestation.\nTriplet pregnancies reduced to twin pregnancies had a lower fetal survival rate of all remaining fetuses, lower gestational age at birth, higher risk of preterm birth, and lower birthweight than triplet pregnancies reduced to singleton pregnancies; reduction to twin pregnancies vs reduction to singleton pregnancies showed no substantial difference for the rates of early pregnancy loss and neonatal death.",

    "abstract": "Steroid 5\u03b1-reductase type 3 congenital disorder of glycosylation (SRD5A3-CDG) is a rare metabolic disease mainly characterized by psychomotor disability, visual impairment, and variable eye malformations caused by bi-allelic pathogenic variants in SRD5A3. So far, only 23 distinct mutations were described. Exome sequencing in 32-year old monozygotic male twins revealed only the heterozygous splice variant c.562+3delG in SRD5A3, but no second variant. The twins presented with psychomotor deficit and a complex eye disease including retinal dystrophy, pallor of the papilla, nystagmus, and strabismus suggestive of SRD5A3-CDG. Only when applying exome-based copy number analysis, we identified as a second compound heterozygous variant a previously not reported tandem duplication of exons 2-4 in SRD5A3. Next to the typical skeletal anomalies of SRD5A3-CDG such as kyphosis and scoliosis, extension deficits of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints IV were observed. Since similar contractures were described once in a patient with SRD5A3-CDG, we suggest that this rare symptom is possibly associated with SRD5A3-CDG. Our findings further expand the mutational and clinical spectrum of SRD5A3-CDG and emphasize the importance of an intragenic copy number analysis in patients with strong clinical suspicion of SRD5A3-CDG and only one detectable sequence variant.",

    "abstract": "Single intrauterine fetal death increases the risk of antenatal brain lesions in the surviving twin. We evaluated the prevalence of structural brain lesions, biometry, and diffusivity on routine third trimester MR imaging performed following single intrauterine fetal death.\nIn a retrospective MR imaging-based cohort study, we compared 29 monochorionic twins complicated with single intrauterine fetal death (14 following laser ablation treatment for twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, 8 following selective fetal reduction, and 7 spontaneous) with 2 control cohorts (49 singleton fetuses and 28 uncomplicated twin fetuses). All fetuses in the single intrauterine fetal death group underwent fetal brain MR imaging as a routine third trimester evaluation. Structural brain lesions were analyzed. Cerebral biometry and diffusivity were measured and compared.\nBrain lesions consistent with the evolution of prior ischemic injury were found in 1 of 29 fetuses, not detected by ultrasound. No acute brain infarction, hemorrhage, or cortical abnormalities were found. Supratentorial biometric measurements in the single intrauterine fetal death group were significantly smaller than those in the singleton group, but not significantly different from those in the uncomplicated twin group. There were no significant differences in ADC values of the cerebral hemispheres, basal ganglia, and pons between the single intrauterine fetal death group and either control group.\nAlthough smaller brain biometry was found, normal diffusivity in surviving twins suggests normal parenchymal microstructure. The rate of cerebral structural injury was relatively low in our cohort, arguing against the routine use of fetal brain MR imaging in twin pregnancies complicated with single intrauterine fetal death. Larger prospective studies are necessary to guide appropriate surveillance protocol and parental counseling in twin pregnancies complicated by single intrauterine fetal death.",

    "abstract": "Pallister-Hall syndrome (OMIM #146510) is a rare autosomal dominant condition caused by a mutation in the GLI3 gene. The cardinal feature of Pallister-Hall syndrome is the presence of hypothalamic hamartomas, which may manifest with seizures, panhypopituitarism and visual impairment. In Pallister-Hall syndrome, dysplastic histogenetic processes responsible for hypothalamic hamartomas are thought to disrupt early craniofacial development. The clinical presentation of Pallister-Hall syndrome may include: characteristic facies (low-set and posteriorly angulated ears, short nose with flat nasal bridge), cleft palate and uvula, bifid epiglottis and laryngotracheal cleft, limb anomalies (e.g., polysyndactyly, short limbs and nail dysplasia), anal atresia, genitourinary abnormalities and congenital heart defects.\nWe report the case of two monochorionic diamniotic twins diagnosed with Pallister-Hall syndrome during the neonatal period, after the identification of a hypothalamic hamartoma on day 1 by cerebral ultrasound scan, later confirmed by brain magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebral ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging presentations were identical in both twins.\nWe review previously published cases (four reports) of hypothalamic hamartomas identified via cerebral ultrasound and compare reported ultrasonographic features. Main differential diagnoses based on cerebral ultrasound findings are discussed. Full description of typical magnetic resonance imaging appearance is also provided. This is the first case reported in the literature of monochorionic diamniotic twins affected by genetically confirmed Pallister-Hall syndrome with identical hypothalamic hamartomas at cerebral ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, this paper adds to the existing literature on the sonographic appearance of hypothalamic hamartomas. Considering the consistency in hypothalamic hamartomas' sonographic appearance, we support the use of cerebral ultrasound as a first-line neuroimaging modality in case of clinical suspicion of Pallister-Hall syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Disturbances in positive affect and reductions in social reward/interpersonal pleasure are common across a range of clinical disorders and are often related. We examined the relationship between the Anticipatory and Consummatory Interpersonal Pleasure Scale (ACIPS-A), and other measures of positive affect in adolescents in a genetically informative research design. The sample consisted of 177 MZ and 136 same sex DZ twins drawn from a study of adolescent twins (M = 16.4 \u00b1 .97 years) who were part of the Wisconsin Twin Project. The self-report questionnaires included the Behavioral Activation Scale (BAS), Psychological Well-Being Scale, revised Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire (EATQR) and the adolescent version of the ACIPS (ACIPS-A). Structural equation modeling estimated the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the phenotypic variance in each of the measures. Follow-up bivariate analyses parsed the genetic and environmental contributions to the phenotypic covariances between the ACIPS-A and each of the other measures of positive affect. We found evidence of moderate heritability for the ACIPS-A scale scores. Overall, models specifying additive genetic and unique environmental effects (AE models) were the most parsimonious models for each of the measures. Several of the measures showed moderate positive phenotypic intercorrelations, and all but one of these intercorrelations showed significant partial genetic underpinnings. Moreover, the bivariate biometric analyses indicated that the ACIPS-A also captures unique heritable variation. Thus, the ACIPS-A captures unique heritable contributions to social/interpersonal pleasure, as well as shared genetic variance with other measures of positive affectivity.",

    "abstract": "SignificanceHistorically, two types of twins (I and II) have been categorized for twinning in minerals and metals. When analyzed by the topological model, a crystallographic construction used to define the defect structure of interfaces, triclinic and some other low-symmetry crystals do not fall into either category and instead form two new twinning types, namely, III and IV. Aside from accurately describing twin structures, these concepts are important for understanding the deformation of minerals such as plagioclase and for deriving constitutive models for the deformation.",

    "abstract": "The aim: To assess morphometric parameters of placentas and to evaluate the correlation between the placental disk shape, the site of the umbilical cord insertion and the birth weight of dichorionic twins.\nMaterials and methods: The geometry of placentas, distances between umbilical cord insertion sites and the centroids of the disks were measured in 135 pairs of dichorionic diamniotic twins. The impact of the above-mentioned parameters on the birth weight and placental mass was analyzed.\nResults: In terms of weight and geometric parameters of placentas, no proven discrepancy between different types of twins and inside pairs was found. A strong correlation was established between the placental weight and birth weight (r = 0.71, p < 0.05). Both the placental weight and birth weight showed the strong correlation with S*Circ (r = 0.62, p < 0.05). The displacement of the umbilical cord insertion site from the centroid of the placenta was negatively correlated with its mass (r = -0.428, p < 0.0001) and birth weight (r = -0.6115, p < 0.0001). The displacement along the maximum axis proved to play a significant role.\nConclusions: In dichorionic diamniotic twins, the area of the placentas plays the determining role in the functional activity of the organ, which increases when its shape approaches the circle. The area of the placenta multiplied by its circularity had the strongest correlation with birth weight and placental mass. The farther from the centre the umbilical cord is inserted, the lower the functional capacity of the placenta is.",

    "abstract": "Personalised computer models of cardiac function, referred to as cardiac digital twins, are envisioned to play an important role in clinical precision therapies of cardiovascular diseases. A major obstacle hampering clinical translation involves the significant computational costs involved in the personalisation of biophysically detailed mechanistic models that require the identification of high-dimensional parameter vectors. An important aspect to identify in electromechanics (EM) models are active mechanics parameters that govern cardiac contraction and relaxation. In this study, we present a novel, fully automated, and efficient approach for personalising biophysically detailed active mechanics models using a two-step multi-fidelity solution. In the first step, active mechanical behaviour in a given 3D EM model is represented by a purely phenomenological, low-fidelity model, which is personalised at the organ scale by calibration to clinical cavity pressure data. Then, in the second step, median traces of nodal cellular active stress, intracellular calcium concentration, and fibre stretch are generated and utilised to personalise the desired high-fidelity model at the cellular scale using a 0D model of cardiac EM. Our novel approach was tested on a cohort of seven human left ventricular (LV) EM models, created from patients treated for aortic coarctation (CoA). Goodness of fit, computational cost, and robustness of the algorithm against uncertainty in the clinical data and variations of initial guesses were evaluated. We demonstrate that our multi-fidelity approach facilitates the personalisation of a biophysically detailed active stress model within only a few (2 to 4) expensive 3D organ-scale simulations-a computational effort compatible with clinical model applications.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction patients had decreased methylation at four growth differentiating factor-15 (GDF-15) related CpG sites (cg13033858, cg16936953, cg17150809, and cg18608055). These sites had not been studied for their association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths. Thus, we aimed to assess the associations independent of genes, shared environment, and traditional CVD risk factors. Nineteen white, male, monozygotic twin pairs discordant for CVD deaths were included from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Twin Study (NHLBI) initiated in 1969. Data on vital status was collected through December 31, 2014. Methylation of buffy coat DNA at exam 3 (1986-87) was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Principal component analysis was used to generate a score representing blood leukocyte composition and baseline CVD risk factors and predominated with natural killer cells, CD4+ T cells, and Framingham risk score. Conditional logistic regression demonstrated that methylation at the four CpG sites was not associated with CVD deaths before (all p\u2009>\u20090.05, bootstrapped p\u2009>\u20090.05) and after adjustment for the score (all p\u2009>\u20090.05). Joint influences of cg16936953 and the score were statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In conclusion, joint influences of methylation at the site cg16936953 and the score are prospectively associated with CVD deaths independent of germline and common environment.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier for NHLBI Twin Study: NCT00005124.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twining is one of the most fascinating and challenging situations which a pediatric surgeon may face in his career. Only few surgeons may have the opportunity to share in separation of such cases. In this report, we aim to share our experience with the successful separation of ventrally fused male conjoined twins (omphaloischiopagus). The case was thoroughly studied via preoperative cross-sectional imaging modalities (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and computed tomography [CT] angiography), complemented by data obtained from reviewing similar cases in the literature. A clear delineation of the complex anatomy was achieved preoperatively which proved to be well consistent with the operative findings. A detailed description of the operative procedure to divide/redistribute the shared abdominal/pelvic organs between both twins is provided. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the detailed and unique internal anatomy of a common central phallus associating ischiopagus conjoined twins. The penis was centrally located in the perineum in between both twins with an open urethral plate. This common phallus had a peculiar configuration with four crura anchoring ischial bones of both twins together.",

    "abstract": "The extraordinary increase in twin rates and specifically monochorionic twin pregnancies represents a major public health issue due to the associated increased risks for the mother, the child and their relationship. The aim of the present study was to examine the quality of mothers' behaviour during mother-infant interaction in the early postpartum period by comparing mothers of twins and mothers of singletons during face-to-face interaction with their infants. Demographic and clinical information was collected by trained research psychologists from the mothers' and the childrens' clinical records and from interviews with the mothers. At three months (corrected for prematurity), the interactions of the dyads (11 mother-twin infant dyads and 11 mother-singleton dyads) were filmed at participants' homes in accordance with the procedure of the Global Rating Scales. Maternal behaviour during interactions was assessed and rated by two trained research psychologists. With regard to the mothers' interaction with each twin, no differences were found between mothers' scores in every GRS subscale, indicating that mothers did not interact differently with their twins. Comparisons between mothers of MC twins and mothers of singletons showed that the quality of maternal sensitive behaviour during the interactions were lower in mothers of twins (0.35) Mothers of twins were also more distant during interactions with their babies and more likely to experience depression symptoms than mothers of singletons (0.05). Future research should examine mother-infant relationships following twin birth with larger samples. Such research will be especially useful in evaluating the potential benefits of interventions to promote positive mother-infant interactions.",

    "abstract": "Research is scarce on the role of familial factors and previous psychiatric care on the association between suicide attempt and future work incapacity as well as deterioration in mental health. We aimed to investigate the associations between suicide attempt and sickness absence, disability pension and psychiatric patient care and to study the influence of previous psychiatric care and familial factors (genetics and shared environment) on the associations.\nThe study included 65 097 twins living in Sweden on 31st of December 2006, aged 19-60 years. The twins were followed 2007-2013 regarding sickness absence, disability pension, inpatient care or specialized outpatient care for a mental diagnosis. Cox regression models were performed for the whole sample, and conditional models for discordant twin pairs. The analyses were also stratified by psychiatric care before 2007.\nWe found that suicide attempt predicted sickness absence, disability pension, and future mental diagnosis among the whole sample. The discordant twin pair analyses showed that the association between suicide attempt and sickness absence or disability pension was influenced by familial factors. Stratified analyses of individuals with or without psychiatric care before 2007 showed that previous psychiatric care had some impact on the associations.\nA suicide attempt is a risk factor for work incapacity and psychiatric patient care. Familial factors and previous psychiatric care play a role in the associations between attempting suicide and work incapacity as well as psychiatric patient care. These factors are important when developing measures preventing work incapacity among those with a suicide attempt.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies are widely used to estimate heritability of traits and typically rely on knowing the zygosity of twin pairs in order to determine variation attributable to genetics. Most twin studies are conducted in high resource settings. Large scale household survey data, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys, collect various biomarkers for children under five years old in low- and middle-income countries. These data include twins but no information on zygosity. We applied mixture models to obtain heritability estimates without knowing zygosity of twins, using 249 Demographic and Health Surveys from 79 low- and middle-income countries (14,524 twin pairs). We focused on height of children, adjusted for age and sex, but also provided estimates for other biomarkers available in the data. We estimated that the heritability of height in our sample was 46%.",

    "abstract": "This is a case report of a 39-year-old patient, G5P1031, with monochorionic diamniotic twins at 30\u00a0weeks and 1\u00a0day of gestation, who developed mirror syndrome without twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) with a unique presentation of maternal and neonatal hyponatremia. Coinciding with severe hyponatremia were maternal symptoms of edema, nausea and vomiting, hypoalbuminemia, elevated uric acid, as well as fetal selective growth restriction, polyhydramnios, umbilical artery absent end diastolic flow and prolonged bradycardia of twin B. Given the poor status of twin B and the risks to twin A, the patient underwent emergent cesarean delivery. Hyponatremia in all three patients resolved in the following 48-72\u00a0h. Mirror syndrome is associated with significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. In this case, severe hyponatremia posed additional risks. Therefore, electrolyte monitoring should be considered in both mother and neonate(s).",

    "abstract": "With the growth of the world population, cities expand and encroach on forests and plants, causing many environmental problems. Digital Twin, as the rapidly developing technique in recent years, provides the opportunity to implement the specific situation of forests and plants at present or in the future, which has great performance on predictive analysis and optimization. From the consideration of plants and forests, this study provides a comprehensive case study to research the relationship between urban development boundary and natural environment in a natural preserve in a coastal city. Multispectral data of the study area is collected by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), combining satellite remote sensing (RS) historical data and geographic data to establish the digital twin model for plant identification. In conjunction with local Master planning of land use, the results of modeling are used to analyze the influences of urban construction on the natural environment, and the inappropriate aspects of the planning are discovered and summarized. In addition, 6 suggestions for effective management and planning strategies are presented. As plants and forests are effective factors of natural conditions, this study offered an objective assessment for the sustainability and rationality of urban planning with some guidance and bases.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this study are to estimate the contributions of genetic factors to the variation of tea drinking and cigarette smoking, to examine the roles of genetic factors in their correlation and further to investigate underlying causation between them. We included 11\u2009625 male twin pairs from the Chinese National Twin Registry (CNTR). Bivariate genetic modelling was fitted to explore the genetic influences on tea drinking, cigarette smoking and their correlation. Inference about Causation through Examination of FAmiliaL CONfounding (ICE FALCON) was further used to explore the causal relationship between them. We found that genetic factors explained 17% and 23% of the variation in tea drinking and cigarette smoking, respectively. A low phenotypic association between them was reported (r",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue is a central regulator of metabolic health and its failure in obesity is a major cause of weight associated comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes. Many extracellular matrix proteins, represented by matrisome, play a critical role in balancing adipose tissue health and dysfunction. Extracellular matrix components, produced by different cell types of adipose tissue, can modulate adipocyte function, tissue remodeling during expansion, angiogenesis, and inflammation and also form fibrotic lesions in the tissue. In this study, we investigated changes in matrisome of whole adipose tissue and adipocytes in human obesity. We investigated further the networks and biological pathways of the genes related to the changes and their association to development of metabolic dysfunction linked to type 2 diabetes. We used transcriptome data and clinical metabolic parameters from a rare weight-discordant MZ twin cohort. The Heavy-Lean differential matrisome gene expression (\u0394matrisome) and differential metabolic parameters reflect changes in adipose tissue upon weight gain and changes in whole body glucose, insulin metabolism, as well as lipid status. We report that obesity \u0394matrisome shows high specificity with 130 and 71 of the 1068 matrisome genes showing altered expression in the adipose tissue and adipocytes of heavier co-twin, respectively. The \u0394matrisome differs considerably between adipose tissue vs adipocytes which reflects inflammation of hypertrophic adipocytes and the remodeling activity of the rest of the tissue resident cells. The obesity \u0394matrisome is discussed extensively in the light of existing evidence and novel significant associations to obesity are reported to matrisome genes; cathepsin A, cathepsin O, FAM20B and N-glycanase1.",

    "abstract": "It is unknown if genetics contribute to the etiology of acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATR). The aims of the present study were, 1) To calculate the concordance rate for monozygotic (MZ) twins and same-sex dizygotic (SSDZ) twins and 2) to estimate the heritability of ATR.\nThe study was performed as a registry study using the Danish Twin Registry and the Danish National Patient Registry.\nThe study sample consisted of 85,534 twins born from 1895 to 1995. Of these, 572 (0.67%) were registered with ATR in the period from 1994 to 2014. The concordance rate was 8.1% (95% CI 1.4-14.7%) for MZ twins and 4.3% (95% CI 0.7-7.9%) for SSDZ twins. The heritability of ATR was 47% (95% CI 31-62%).\nThis study found that genetics contribute substantially to the etiology of ATR with an estimated heritability of the liability to ATR of approximately 50%. The finding generates the hypothesis that genetics play a role in the pathological changes that occur in the Achilles tendon before a rupture. The risk of ATR for a twin within a 20 year period, if the co-twin has had an ATR, was 8% for MZ twins and 4% for SSDZ twins.",

    "abstract": "Data mining technology has gradually become an important data analysis and knowledge discovery technology widely used in many modern industries. Data mining is a technique to find its regularity from a large amount of data by analyzing each data. It mainly includes three steps: data preparation, regularity search, and regularity representation. Data preparation is to select the required data from relevant data sources and integrate them into a data set for data mining; regular search is to find out the regularity contained in the data set by a certain method; regular expression is to be as user-readable as possible. The way of understanding (such as visualization) will represent the found patterns. This research mainly discusses the improvement of teaching mode based on digital twin-based education big data mining. Through the research on the basic principles of data mining and digital twin technology, the student evaluation tool module based on digital twin and the relevant data analysis tool module of students based on digital twin education big data mining are developed. Data mining is carried out from the data of student performance, personal basic information, and evaluation information to find the correlation between various factors, find the hidden laws, and provide support for teaching decision-making. This paper also solves the problem of frequent communication with remote databases according to the characteristics of the database data required by students and improves the efficiency and scalability of education big data mining technology based on digital twins. The goal of the virtual interactive system of the digital twin-based CNC platform is to have both three-dimensional real-time monitoring and remote control functions based on a three-dimensional virtual CNC panel. This research integrates the three-dimensional real-time monitoring and remote control of the virtual interactive system, analyzes the system operation process, develops the system interface, and improves the system sub-functions; it builds an experimental environment, conducts example tests on various functions of the digital twin platform virtual interactive system, and performs virtual interactions system performance indicators are analyzed. 60% of students believe that their innovation ability has been improved after the implementation of the digital twin teaching model; 50% of students believe that their self-evaluation ability has been improved. Applying digital twin's educational big data mining to student information management, university teaching evaluation, student performance analysis, and examination system, it has played a very good guiding role in improving the level of school teaching management.",

    "abstract": "Estimated food records (EFR) are a common dietary assessment method. This investigation aimed to; (1) define the reporting quality of the EFR, (2) characterise acute dietary intake and eating behaviours, (3) describe diet heritability.\nA total of 1974 one-day EFR were collected from 1858 participants in the TwinsUK cohort between 2012 and 2017. EFR were assessed using a six-point scoring system to determine reporting quality. The frequency and co-occurrence of food items was examined using word clouds and co-occurrence networks. The impact of eating behaviours on weight, BMI and nutrient intake were explored using mixed-effect linear regression models. Finally, diet heritability was estimated using ACE modelling.\nWe observed that 75% of EFR are of acceptable reporting quality (score\u2009>\u20095). Black tea and semi-skimmed milk were the most consumed items, on an individual basis (respectively 8.27, 6.25%) and paired (0.21%) as co-occurring items. Breakfast consumption had a significantly (p\u00a0=\u20095.99\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nEFR describing acute dietary intake allow for eating behaviour characterisation and can supplement habitual diet intake assessments.

    "abstract": "Civil infrastructure O&M requires intelligent monitoring techniques and control methods to ensure safety. Unfortunately, tedious modeling efforts and the rigorous computing requirements of large-scale civil infrastructure have hindered the development of structural research. This study proposes a method for impact response prediction of prestressed steel structures driven by digital twins (DTs) and machine learning (ML). The high-fidelity DTs of a prestressed steel structure were constructed from the perspective of both a physical entity and virtual entity. A prediction of the impact response of prestressed steel structure's key parts was established based on ML, and a structure response prediction of the parts driven by data was realized. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed prediction method, the authors carried out a case study in an experiment of a prestressed steel structure. This study provides a reference for fusion applications with DTs and ML in impact response prediction and analysis of prestressed steel structures.",

    "abstract": "The '15-minute city' concept is emerging as a potent urban regeneration model in post-pandemic cities, offering new vantage points on liveability and urban health. While the concept is primarily geared towards rethinking urban morphologies, it can be furthered via the adoption of Smart Cities network technologies to provide tailored pathways to respond to contextualised challenges through the advent of data mining and processing to better inform urban decision-making processes. We argue that the '15-minute city' concept can value-add from Smart City network technologies in particular through Digital Twins, Internet of Things (IoT), and 6G. The data gathered by these technologies, and processed via Machine Learning techniques, can unveil new patterns to understand the characteristics of urban fabrics. Collectively, those dimensions, unpacked to support the '15-minute city' concept, can provide new opportunities to redefine agendas to better respond to economic and societal needs as well as align more closely with environmental commitments, including the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 11 and the New Urban Agenda. This perspective paper presents new sets of opportunities for cities arguing that these new connectivities should be explored now so that appropriate protocols can be devised and so that urban agendas can be recalibrated to prepare for upcoming technology advances, opening new pathways for urban regeneration and resilience crafting.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients present higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), and proper management of the disease in this population requires a better understanding of how the immune system controls the virus. We analyzed the T cell and B cell phenotypes, and their repertoire in a pair of monozygotic twins with RA mismatched for COVID-19 infection. Twin- was not infected, while Twin+ was infected and effectively controlled the infection. We found no significant changes on the \u03b1\u03b2 T cell composition, while \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and B cells presented considerable expansion of memory population in Twin+ and robust T/B cell responses to several SARS-CoV-2 peptides. T cell receptor \u03b2/\u03b3-chain and immunoglobulin heavy chain next-generation sequencing depicted a remarkable higher diversity in Twin+ compared with Twin-, despite no significant changes being found in variable/joining family usage. Repertoire overlap analyses showed that, although being identical twins, very few clones were shared between them, indicating that COVID-19 may lead to deep changes on the immune cell repertoire in RA patients. Altogether, our results indicate that RA patients may develop robust and persistent COVID-19-specific T/B cell responses; \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and B cells may play a key role in the management of COVID-19 in RA, and the infection may lead to a profound reshaping of immune cell receptor specificities.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of intelligent technology has brought a particular impact and allows for virtuality-reality interaction in the educational field. In particular, digital twins (DTs) feature virtuality-reality symbiosis, solid virtual simulation, and high real-time interaction. It has also seen extended applications to the field of education. This study optimizes the design of the visual communication (Viscom) course based on the deep learning (DL) algorithm. Firstly, the theory of DL is analyzed following the relevant literature, and the typical DL networks, network structures, and related algorithms are introduced. Secondly, Viscom technology is expounded, and DL technology is applied to the Viscom course. Then, the applicability and feasibility of DL in the Viscom course are analyzed through a questionnaire survey (QS) design by collecting students' attitudes towards Viscom courses before and after the experiment. After introducing DL into the Viscom course, the results show that students' learning interest and satisfaction with the practical knowledge mastery have increased. However, the satisfaction with theoretical knowledge mastery before practical courses has decreased; overall, the teaching effect of the Viscom course has been improved. Therefore, the introduction of DL into the DT-enabled Viscom can provide a reference for developing the Viscom course. The research content offers technical support (TS) for integrating DT technology and modern education.",

    "abstract": "The familial occurrence of childhood cancers has been proven for a long time. Wilms' tumors often do not have a clear germline genetic cause. However, approximately 2% of all nephroblastoma cases are familial. Descriptions of twins with the same cancer are extremely rare, so our aim was to present the background of the available literature of the occurrence of Wilms' tumor in a pair of monozygotic twin girls with detailed clinical, histological, and molecular analysis. Two twins were born of unrelated Caucasian parents. Family history revealed no known chronic diseases or malformations. At the age of 3.5 years, the first twin was admitted to the emergency department due to hematuria and abdominal pain. Ultrasound examination revealed an enlarged right kidney, 12.8 cm, with a mass in the upper pole measuring 56 \u00d7 69 \u00d7 78 mm. The second girl was referred for an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed a right kidney measuring 8.6 cm with a central mass measuring 54 \u00d7 45 \u00d7 41 mm. Both children underwent surgical resection, and the histopathological result showed a mixed form of nephroblastoma, predominantly epithelioid with residual blastemal compartment. Detailed clinical, histological, cytogenetic, and molecular analyses were performed on both sisters. It was also decided to identify environmental factors. Information was obtained that the girls' parents run a farm and regularly use pesticides and chemical rodenticides. Based on our observations and the available literature, Wilms tumor in monozygotic twins may be present. Both genetic and environmental factors may be involved in the development of tumors. After excluding methylation abnormalities and mutations in the genes studied, we questioned whether the onset of Wilms tumor in both sisters could be the result of exposure of the twins' parents to pesticides.",

    "abstract": "Children affected by orofacial disorders mix functional alterations with morphological problems, and suitable techniques should be devised for their analysis. Stereophotogrammetry and 3D-3D facial superimposition have already proven to reliably assess morphological differences even between twin siblings, separating the effect of genetic and environmental factors. However, little information is available about twin babies. We longitudinally analyzed a couple of healthy monozygotic twin sisters aged 6 months to 5 years (height time points). The entire 3D facial models of the two sisters were registered according to the least point-to-point distance, and the relevant RMS (root mean square) distance between the facial models was calculated at each time and compared with reference data recorded from adult twins (Mann-Whitney test, ",

Even identical twins with the same genetic load may differ substantially in facial wrinkles and aging, demanding a personalized treatment approach.\nTo demonstrate the ONE21 technique as an excellent tool to a customized assessment and IncobotulinuntoxinA treatment to address phenotype discordances and epigenetic drifts in identical twins, expressed by different patterns of upper face muscle contractions and wrinkles intensity.\nFive pairs of identical Caucasian twin sisters, from 30 to 45\u00a0years of age, were evaluated for hyperfunctional upper facial wrinkles (forehead, glabella, and periorbital), assessing the individual anatomy, muscle function and habitual facial movements of each patient. All the subjects were treated with the ONE21 technique using IncobotulinumtoxinA and reevaluated 30\u00a0days after the procedure.\nThough the clinical-anatomical pattern of the forehead contraction was similar between the pairs, the strength of the muscles, the number and depth of wrinkles differed. This varied presentation demanded distinct points of distribution and dosages of incobotulinumtoxinA for all the twins, according to the ONE21 approach.

    "abstract": "Prolidase deficiency (PD) is an autosomal recessive inborn multisystemic disease caused by mutations in the PEPD gene encoding the enzyme prolidase D, leading to defects in turnover of proline-containing proteins, such as collagen. PD is categorized as a metabolic disease, but also as an inborn error of immunity. PD presents with a range of findings including dysmorphic features, intellectual disabilities, recurrent infections, intractable skin ulceration, autoimmunity, and splenomegaly. Despite symptoms of immune dysregulation, only very limited immunologic assessments have been reported and standard therapies for PD have not been described. We report twin females with PD, including comprehensive immunologic profiles and treatment modalities used.\nPatient 1 had recurrent infections in childhood. At age 13, she presented with telangiectasia, followed by painful, refractory skin ulcerations on her lower limbs, where skin biopsy excluded vasculitis. She had typical dysmorphic features of PD. Next-generation sequencing revealed pathogenic compound heterozygous mutations (premature stop codons) in the PEPD gene. Patient 2 had the same mutations, typical PD facial features, atopy, and telangiectasias, but no skin ulceration. Both patients had imidodipeptiduria. Lymphocyte subset analysis revealed low-normal frequency of T\nImmunologic abnormalities including skewed frequencies of activated inflammatory CD4",

Of 778 Hebrew-speaking Israeli families who participated in a twin study, 63 were identified to have a non-TD child with a TD twin, and 404 as having both twins TD. TD twins of non-TD children (27% males) were compared to the rest of the cohort of TD children (46% males) on measures of empathy and prosociality. Participants were 11\u00a0years old. TD twins of non-TD children scored significantly higher than TD twins of TD children in a measure of cognitive empathy (d\u00a0=\u00a0.43). No differences were found in emotional empathy and prosociality. The specificity of the positive effect on cognitive empathy is discussed.",

    "abstract": "With the development of science and technology, the high-tech industry is developing rapidly, and various new-age technologies continue to appear, and Digital Twins (DT) is one of them. As a brand-new interactive technology, DT technology can handle the interaction between the real world and the virtual world well. It has become a hot spot in the academic circles of all countries in the world. DT have developed rapidly in recent years result from centrality, integrity and dynamics. It is integrated with other technologies and has been applied in many fields, such as smart factory in industrial production, digital model of life in medical field, construction of smart city, security guarantee in aerospace field, immersive shopping in commercial field and so on. The introduction of DT is mostly a summary of concepts, and few practical applications of Digital Twins are introduced. The purpose of this paper is to enable people to understand the application status of DT technology. At the same time, the introduction of core technologies related to DT is interspersed in the application introduction. Finally, combined with the current development status of DT, predict the future development trend of DT and make a summary.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal Malrotation is an uncommon entity in the adult population; more so in monozygotic twins, where concordance is expected. In literature, discordant intestinal Malrotation has only been discovered when one twin became symptomatic, and the other was screened. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of discordant adult type intestinal Malrotation in otherwise asymptomatic monozygotic twins discovered incidentally during Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass (LRYGB).\nTwins A and B met the NIH criteria for bariatric surgery, neither having symptoms of acute or chronic volvulus or history of intraabdominal surgery. Twin A had a LRYGB performed by a trained bariatric surgeon, noting no anatomic anomalies. 5\u00a0months later, Twin B had LRYGB and intestinal Malrotation was diagnosed incidentally.\nDiagnosis of Intestinal Malrotation is rare in adults, usually discovered after becoming symptomatic or during abdominal imaging for another indication. Two cases of discordant intestinal Malrotation in monozygotic twins have been documented, both discovered when one twin became symptomatic due to acute volvulus, suggesting epigenetic phenomena. When discovered incidentally during surgery, patients can safely undergo their intended procedure, but literature suggests prophylactic division of Ladd's bands, while appendectomy is left to the discretion of the surgeon.\nIntestinal Malrotation appears to be associated with epigenetic phenomena and if discovered incidentally during surgery, the proposed procedure can be carried out by an experienced surgeon, in addition to division of Ladd's bands and appendectomy.",

    "abstract": "The heritability of Alzheimer's disease estimated from twin studies is greater than the heritability derived from genome-based studies, for reasons that remain unclear. We apply both approaches to the same twin sample, considering both Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk scores and heritability from twin models, to provide insight into the role of measured genetic variants and to quantify uncaptured genetic risk. A population-based heritability and polygenic association study of Alzheimer's disease was conducted between 1986 and 2016 and is the first study to incorporate polygenic risk scores into biometrical twin models of Alzheimer's disease. The sample included 1586 twins drawn from the Swedish Twin Registry which were nested within 1137 twin pairs (449 complete pairs and 688 incomplete pairs) with clinically based diagnoses and registry follow-up (",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are rare and present a challenge for surgeons and radiologists and classified according to the main site of connection: thorax (thoracopagus), abdomen (omphalopagus), etc. Here, we report a Seventeen-month-old, female omphalopagus conjoined twins, born from a mother with a family history of twins, who performed CT-scan and ultrasound echocardiography for elective surgery preparation and X-ray evaluation after the separation surgery. From the CT-Scan examination, revealed each baby had its own, separate heart (one with dextrocardia), each baby had its own liver but they were partially fused and several small branches crossed each other (superior mesenteric artery, intercostal artery, and hepatic vasculature). Findings at surgery are consistent with radiological findings, but we missed to evaluate the pericardium despite being informed by the CT-scan that each baby had its own heart. Radiological investigation plays an important role in the evaluation, all possibilities must be taken into account: operation feasibility, shared organs, soft tissue, and bone structure.",

    "abstract": "Twins involve a higher risk of perinatal complications compared to singletons. We compared the risk of under five mortality between twins and singletons among late preterm and term births. The national birth data of South Korea pertaining to the years 2010-2014 linked with the mortality record of children aged under 5 years in 2010-2019 was analyzed. The final study population was 2,199,632 singletons and 62,351 twins. We conducted a survival analysis of under-five mortality with adjustment for neonatal and familial factors. Overall under-five mortality rates during the study period were 3.6 and 2.0 for twins and singletons, respectively. Although the unadjusted overall under-five mortality was higher in twins (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.57, 2.06, overall risk), twin birth was associated with comparable or lower risk (HR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.85, overall; 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.87, excluding neonatal mortality; 0.59, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.86, excluding infant mortality) after controlling for both neonatal and familial factors. Twins born at a gestational age of 34-35 weeks showed a generally lower risk of under-five mortality than their singleton counterparts, regardless of model specification.Conclusion: Among late preterm and term birth, under-5-year mortalities for twins were lower than singleton births when adjusted for neonatal and familial risk factors. This highlights the differential implication of gestational age at birth between twin and singleton in the child mortality.",

    "abstract": "Monoamniotic twins have a high risk of mortality and perinatal morbidity due to cord entanglement and vascular anastomosis. Despite efforts to reduce the mortality rate through intensive fetal surveillance and timed delivery, poor long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes remain an unsolved problem. This study aimed to identify novel biomarkers predicting abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes in monoamniotic twins with cord blood samples taken at the time of delivery. Abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes were defined as (1) a severe brain lesion on neonatal brain ultrasound, (2) developmental delay, (3) cerebral palsy, and/or (4) blindness or deafness. Cord blood was analyzed with mass spectrometry-based proteomics according to the neurodevelopmental outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the differentially expressed proteins between neonates with normal and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes. Several candidate proteins were further validated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. A total of 20 neonates (10 pairs) of monoamniotic twins were included in the proteomic analysis, of which 25% had abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes. Eighteen proteins were differentially expressed in neonates with abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes. The upregulated proteins in the neonates with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome were immunoglobulin (Ig)-gamma-4 chain C region, apolipoprotein E, and alpha-fetoprotein. In contrast, Ig-lambda chain V region 4A, Ig-heavy variable 3, Ig-kappa chain C region, Ig-mu chain C region, C1q, ceruloplasmin, and Ig-lambda chain V-I region were decreased. In the validation experiment, the cord blood concentration of ceruloplasmin was significantly lower in neonates with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes than in those without. Therefore, ceruloplasmin could be a useful predictive biomarker of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in monoamniotic twins.",

No authors investigated if intrinsic genetic factors or influences from extrinsic sources are responsible for its variability.\nWe compared glenoid version between elderly monozygotic and dizygotic twins intending to separate the contributions of genetics from shared and unique environments.\nGlenoid version of the dominant shoulder was assessed by MRI using Friedman's method in 30 pairs of elderly twins (16 monozygotic-14 dizygotic; mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD: 63.72\u2009\u00b1\u20093.37, 53-72). Heritability was estimated as twice the difference between the intraclass correlation coefficients for monozygotic and dizygotic pairs. The influence of shared environment was calculated as the difference between monozygotic correlation coefficient and the heritability index. According to job category, one way analysis of variance was used to estimate the differences between groups in the total sample and within zygosity groups.\nGlenoid version angle in monozygotic and dizygotic twins was -2\u00b0 (SD: 2\u00b0) and -3\u00b0 (SD: 3\u00b0), respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.334).

    "abstract": "Due to social distancing measures implemented to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals are spending more time isolated at home with limited physical social interactions. The current study investigated whether marriage and/or cohabitation is associated with satisfaction with life and depression among 732 adult same-sex twin pairs (monozygotic and dizygotic) in the US using online survey data. Twin analysis showed that married and/or cohabiting individuals were more satisfied with life and less depressed than those not married and/or cohabiting. The association between marriage and/or cohabiting and satisfaction with life was not confounded by between-family factors, whereas that between depression was mediated by familial factors. These findings suggest that being in a close relationship may mitigate some of the adverse consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Close relationships may be an essential source of support as individuals rely on their intimate partners when faced with the uncertainty and stress of the pandemic.",

Both of the previously reported cases exhibited tandem triplication on a 16p11.2 duplication inherited from 1 parent. We report fraternal twins presenting with developmental delay and 16p11.2 triplication resulting from inheritance of a 16p11.2 duplicated homolog from each parent. This report also reviews the overlapping features in previously published cases of 16p11.2 triplication, and possible implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies evaluating hindfoot and knee alignment have suggested compensation between the knee and the hindfoot deformities. However, these studies did not investigate the influence of the orientation of the subtalar axis on the results.\nUsing computed tomography data of patients without osteoarthritis, digital twins, and artificial intelligence, we identified the orientation of the axis of the subtalar joint. Compensation was evaluated in the subtalar joint according to angular knee deformity and subtalar axis direction.\nWith the inclination angle defined as the angle between the axis and the XY plane (horizontal) and the deviation angle defined as the angle between the projection of axis on the XZ plane, the inclination angle of the subtalar helical axis showed an average angle of 35.3\u00b0 (range 5\u00b0 to 48\u00b0). The mean deviation angle for the helical axis was 6.4\u00b0 (range\u2009-\u20094\u00b0 to\u2009+\u200912\u00b0). Our findings indicated that an increase of the inclination angle of the subtalar axis tends to limit adjustment in the hindfoot alignment toward re-balance of the whole lower limb toward a neutral weight-bearing axis when malalignment of the knee occurs.\nMalalignment of the knee and different compensations in the hindfoot contribute to various combined deformities in the population: associated valgus or varus deformities and inverse associations of varus/valgus deformities.",

Furthermore, this is the first report of conjoined twins with detailed morphokinetics of the earliest embryogenesis from zygote to expanded and hatched blastocyst stage. The case zygote had three refractile bodies, which were all allocated to one blastomere at first cleavage following an asynchronous pronuclei fading. Within 2 h, this blastomere cleaved to four and fragmented. The remaining blastomere cleaved symmetrically and regularly and a blastocyst (score: 4AB) was vitrified 120 h after IVF. Pregnancy was achieved following a frozen-thawed single blastocyst transfer. The etiopathogenetic mechanism of the origin of conjoined twins is unknown and several hypotheses exist. The morphokinetics in the present case and morphology of other reported cases will be discussed in this context.",

    "abstract": "The virtual, digital counterpart of a physical object, referred as digital twin, derives from the Internet of Things (IoT), and involves real-time acquisition and processing of large data sets. A fully implemented system ultimately enables real-time and remote management, as well as the reproduction of real and forecasted scenarios. Under the emerging framework of Precision Fish Farming, which brings control-engineering principles to fish production, we set up digital twin prototypes for land-based finfish farms. The digital twin is aimed at supporting producers in optimizing feeding practices, oxygen supply and fish population management with respect to 1) fish growth performances; 2) fish welfare, and 3) environmental loads. It relies on integrated mathematical models which are fed with data from in-situ sensors and from external sources, and simulate several dynamic processes, allowing the estimation of key parameters describing the ambient environment and the fishes.

    "abstract": "Genetic mosaicism caused by postzygotic mutations is of a great interest due to its role in human disease. Monozygotic twins arising from a single zygote are considered as genetically identical, and any differences likely to be caused by postzygotic events. Thus, phenotypically discordant monozygotic twins offer a unique opportunity to study genotype-phenotype correlation. Here, we present a three-generation family starting from a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for metachondromatosis due to postzygotic p.(Gln175His) variant in the PTPN11 gene. Both phenotypically discordant monozygotic twins harbor p.(Gln175His), however significant differences in mosaic ratio is observed not only between twins, but also within different tissue types within one individual. Phenotypic manifestation of p.(Gln175His) in examined family clearly depends on allele variant fraction (VAF). Individuals harboring constitutional mutation (VAF 50%) present typical metachondromatosis. Milder phenotype is observed in twin harboring high-level mosaicism in the tissue of ectodermal origin (VAF 45%), but not in a blood (VAF 5%). Finally, her twin sister harboring low-level mosaicism in blood (VAF 2%) and nonblood (VAF 12%) tissues is phenotypically normal. Our results provide insights into biological role of mosaicism in disease and further support the usefulness of nonblood tissues as an optimal source of DNA for the identification of postzygotic mutations in phenotypically discordant monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "There is no agreement on the effect of planned mode of delivery in the perinatal morbidity and neurodevelopment in uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic as well as regarding the safest mode of delivery. In this paper we have aimed to analyze the impact of the mode of delivery in uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic twins\u2009\u2265\u200932\u00a0weeks of gestation.\nThis study included 72 women, followed and attended at our department, with uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies who had a birth between 32.0 and 37.6\u00a0weeks of gestation from January 2012 to December 2018. Outcomes were recorded in women who underwent planned vaginal delivery (induced or spontaneous onset of labor), and women who underwent a planned cesarean section for any reason that excluded vaginal delivery. Primary outcomes included: (1) A composite of any of the following: neonatal death, 5-min Apgar score\u2009<\u20094, respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis, periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis. (2) Neurodevelopmental status at 2\u00a0years of corrected age.\nIn this period, 42 women (58.3%) had a planned vaginal delivery, and 30 women (41.7%) had a planned cesarean section. In the first group, 64.3% had a vaginal delivery. The rate of successful vaginal delivery was similar regardless the onset of labor. We did not find a higher composite perinatal morbidity in the planned vaginal delivery group (planned vaginal delivery: 3.6% vs. planned cesarean section: 8.3%, aOR 1.36, 95% CI 0.24-7.81). Considering the onset of labor, it was more frequent in the spontaneous subgroup (8.3% vs. 0%). The rate of neurodevelopmental impairment was higher in the planned cesarean section group, without reaching statistical significance [10.2% vs. 4.9%, aOR 1.53 (95% CI 0.37-6.29)].\nIn uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic twins at\u2009\u2265\u200932\u00a0weeks of gestation, when the first twin is in vertex presentation, our results suggest that planned vaginal delivery is safe, with a successful outcome as well as high vaginal delivery rate.",

The rate of successful vaginal delivery was similar regardless the onset of labor. We did not find a higher composite perinatal morbidity in the planned vaginal delivery group (planned vaginal delivery: 3.6% vs. planned cesarean section: 8.3%, aOR 1.36, 95% CI 0.24-7.81). Considering the onset of labor, it was more frequent in the spontaneous subgroup (8.3% vs. 0%). The rate of neurodevelopmental impairment was higher in the planned cesarean section group, without reaching statistical significance [10.2% vs. 4.9%, aOR 1.53 (95% CI 0.37-6.29)].",

    "abstract": "To assess survival to discharge without severe neonatal morbidity by planned mode of delivery for twins born before 32 weeks of gestation.\nThe JUMODA (JUmeaux MODe d'Accouchement) study was a French national prospective, population-based, cohort study of twin deliveries conducted from February 2014 to March 2015. This planned secondary analysis included diamniotic twin pregnancies from 26 0/7 through 31 6/7 weeks of gestation. Exclusion criteria included contraindications to vaginal delivery and situations for which planned cesarean delivery is favored, and neonatal prognosis depends largely on the underlying pathology rather than the planned mode of delivery. The primary outcome was survival to discharge without severe neonatal morbidity (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, grade 3 or grade 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, stage 2 or stage 3 necrotizing enterocolitis). The association between planned mode of delivery and primary outcome was assessed by multivariate Poisson regression model. A propensity-score approach with inverse probability of treatment weighting also was performed to control for indication bias. Subgroup analyses according to birth order and sensitivity analyses limited to spontaneous preterm births only were performed.\nAmong 424 very preterm twin pregnancies, 192 (45.3%) had a planned cesarean delivery and 232 (54.7%) had a planned vaginal delivery. Survival to discharge without severe morbidity did not differ in the two groups: 308 of 384 (80.2%) after planned cesarean and 375 of 464 (80.8%) after planned vaginal delivery (crude relative risk 0.99; 95% CI 0.91-1.15; adjusted relative risk 1.02; 95% CI 0.93-1.11). After applying inverse probability of treatment weighting, planned cesarean delivery still was not associated with higher survival to discharge without severe neonatal morbidity than planned vaginal birth (relative risk 1.11; 95% CI 0.84-1.46). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar results.\nPlanned cesarean delivery for very preterm twins is not associated with higher survival to discharge without severe neonatal morbidity than planned vaginal delivery. These results suggest that very preterm delivery should not be considered a per se indication for planned cesarean in twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "This study leveraged the twin study design, which controls for shared genetic and early life exposures, to investigate the association between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and dementia.\nMembers of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council's Twins Registry of World War II male veterans were assigned a cognitive outcome based on a multi-step assessment protocol. History of TBI was obtained via interviews.\nAmong 8302 individuals, risk of non-Alzheimer's disease (non-AD) dementia was higher in those with TBI (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a02.00, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-4.12), than for AD (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.23, 95% CI, 0.76-2.00). To add more control of genetic and shared environmental factors, we analyzed 100 twin pairs discordant for both TBI and dementia onset, and found TBI-associated risk for non-AD dementia increased further (McNemar odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a02.70; 95% CI, 1.27-6.25).\nThese findings suggest that non-AD mechanisms may underlie the association between TBI and dementia, potentially providing insight into inconsistent results from prior studies.",

    "abstract": "The concept of digital twins has great potential for transforming the existing health care system by making it more personalized. As a convergence of health care, artificial intelligence, and information and communication technologies, personalized health care services that are developed under the concept of digital twins raise a myriad of ethical issues. Although some of the ethical issues are known to researchers working on digital health and personalized medicine, currently, there is no comprehensive review that maps the major ethical risks of digital twins for personalized health care services.\nThis study aims to fill the research gap by identifying the major ethical risks of digital twins for personalized health care services. We first propose a working definition for digital twins for personalized health care services to facilitate future discussions on the ethical issues related to these emerging digital health services. We then develop a process-oriented ethical map to identify the major ethical risks in each of the different data processing phases.\nWe resorted to the literature on eHealth, personalized medicine, precision medicine, and information engineering to identify potential issues and developed a process-oriented ethical map to structure the inquiry in a more systematic way. The ethical map allows us to see how each of the major ethical concerns emerges during the process of transforming raw data into valuable information. Developers of a digital twin for personalized health care service may use this map to identify ethical risks during the development stage in a more systematic way and can proactively address them.\nThis paper provides a working definition of digital twins for personalized health care services by identifying 3 features that distinguish the new application from other eHealth services. On the basis of the working definition, this paper further layouts 10 major operational problems and the corresponding ethical risks.\nIt is challenging to address all the major ethical risks that a digital twin for a personalized health care service might encounter proactively without a conceptual map at hand. The process-oriented ethical map we propose here can assist the developers of digital twins for personalized health care services in analyzing ethical risks in a more systematic manner.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to compare the effect of early or late fetal reduction (FR) procedures on perinatal outcomes in multiple pregnancies reduced to twins or singletons.\nThis retrospective cohort study consisted of data from a single tertiary center between January 2013 and December 2020 and included 103 women with multiple pregnancies between 8 and 14 gestational weeks and who underwent FR by transabdominal approach. Late FR was defined as 11-13 6/7 gestational weeks (Group L) and early FR was defined as 8-10 6/7 gestational weeks (Group E) in the study. All pregnancies with FR were named Group S (Single) if reduced to singletons and Group T (Twin) if reduced to twin pregnancies.\nThirty four percent (n\u00a0=\u00a035) were reduced to single pregnancy, the remaining 66% of these cases (n\u00a0=\u00a068) were reduced to twin pregnancy. The overall survival rate was 90%.When the cases were examined in terms of pregnancy complications, it was observed that the PPROM rate and preterm labor rate in the Group T were statistically significantly higher than the Group S (p\u00a0=\u00a00.015 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively). When comparing the overall survival results between Group S and Group T, it was found that the overall survival of Group S was statistically significantly better (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). When Group E and Group L were compared in terms of their pregnancy course and neonatal outcomes, no statistically significant difference was found between them. No statistically significant difference was found between the complication rates in the first week after the procedure (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Neonatal intensive care need was found at a rate of 31% in those with Group E, while this rate was found as 39% in Group L, and this difference was also not statistically significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.480). When the preterm labor rate was compared between these two groups, there was no statistically significant difference in all three subgroups (<32nd, <34th, and <37th gestational weeks).\nWhen FR to singleton is required for fetal or maternal reasons, it should be discussed with the parents that the risk of fetal loss is similar to FR to twins, but the effect on perinatal survival is more favorable than expected.",

    "abstract": "Parents of newborn twins are at risk for both shortened sleep duration and sleep discontinuity. The purpose of this study was to characterize weekday and weekend sleep duration, sleep continuity, and awakenings in both mothers and fathers of newborn twins during the first 3 months at home.\nSleep-wake parameters were assessed at two time points using self-report diaries and actigraphy in 75 families with newborn twins. To assess sleep on weekdays and weekends with minimal subject burden, actigraphy recordings of both parents commenced at 9:00 p.m. Saturday and terminated at 9:00 p.m. Tuesday.\nMean sleep duration over 24 hours for parents of twins ranged between 6.7 and 7.5 hours during the first 3 months postpartum and did not significantly differ on weekdays or weekends for mothers. Weekend sleep was more fragmented for fathers at both one month and three months with more awakenings, compared to weekday sleep. Mothers had more fragmented night sleep compared to fathers at one month. In contrast, at three months postpartum fathers had shorter total sleep time and night sleep time, but fewer night awakenings on weekdays than mothers. No differences were observed in weekend sleep duration or sleep patterns between mothers and fathers at three months.\nConsolidated sleep periods for both parents averages three hours or less during the first three months postpartum and sleep for both parents is fragmented. In families with newborn twins, the extent of sleep disruption for mothers and fathers is similar.",

    "abstract": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), is a vasoprolipherative disorder of the immature retina and a major cause of preventable blindness in childhood. Although the development of ROP is multifactorial, the main reasons are lower gestational age and birth weight. However, in twins their gestational ages were the same, ROP development can be discordant. This study aims to evaluate the etiologic factors of discordant ROP development in twins.\nWe reviewed the last 5 years' records and found the twins whose discordant ROP development. This discordance was; 1. Different stages of ROP, 2. One sibling treated the other is not, 3. One sibling has aggressive posterior ROP the other is not, 4. one sibling has more influenced area as zones the other is not. We documented some data of these twins, as birth order, birth weight, resuscitation at birth, morbidities, the number of hemotransfusion, age of regaining birth weight, relative weight gain at 28 weeks.\nA total of 26 cases of 13 twins were evaluated. The mean gestational age and birth weight of the whole study group were 27.7 \u00b1 2, and 1053 \u00b1\u00a0 364 grams, respectively. We found that more transfused preterm baby in twins is more likely to show severe ROP. Additionally, sepsis and the duration of mechanical ventilation may be risk factors for more severe ROP in twins.\nWe can reduce discordant retinopathy in less than 32-weeks premature twins by using methods such as cord milking and by improving non-invasive ventilation modalities.",

    "abstract": "The processes that give rise to monozygotic (MZ) twins remain elusive. This article describes various theories of MZ twinning that have been examined over the years, although they continue to be speculative. It has also been impossible to know if a singleton began life as an MZ twin; however, a critical technological breakthrough can now reveal this important birth history information with a high degree of certainty. The section that follows presents reviews of current research regarding rare twin loss, development of a twin registry, twins' communicative delays and DNA testing for vanishing twins. The article concludes with a survey of newsworthy twins, namely identical twins discordant for COVID vaccination, the world's oldest identical twins, an Olympic athletic stand-in and fraternal twin football players.",

    "abstract": "The digital twins technology delivers a new degree of freedom into system implementation and maintenance practice. Using this approach, a technological system can be efficiently modeled and simulated. Furthermore, such a twin offline system can be efficiently used to investigate real system issues and improvement opportunities, e.g., improvement of the existing control system or development of a new one. This work describes the development of a control system using the digital twins methodology for a gas system delivering a specific mixture of gases to the time-of-flight (ToF) multipurpose detector (MPD) used during high-energy physics experiments in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna, Russia). The gas system digital twin was built using a test stand and further extended into target full-scale installation planned to be built in the near future. Therefore, conducted simulations are used to validate the existing system and to allow validation of the planned new system. Moreover, the gas system digital twin enables testing of new control opportunities, improving the operation of the target gas system.",

    "abstract": "Modified metabolites play significant roles in disease occurrence, progression and diagnosis. Sensitive and accurate analytical methods for the quantification of these metabolites are therefore of great importance. In this study, a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for the simultaneous measurement of 13 pairs of prototypes and their modified forms covering nucleobases, nucleosides and amino acids. In order to improve the quantification sensitivity and accuracy, two structure analogs named N-dimethyl-amino naphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride (Dns-Cl) and N-diethyl-amino naphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride (Dens-Cl) were introduced for twins labeling derivatization. Dns-labeling was utilized to react with target analytes while the Dens-labeling of standard compounds provided one-to-one internal standards. With the introduce of naphthalene and easily ionizable moiety tertiary ammonium, chromatography retention and separation of these polar metabolites were notably improved on C18 columns and the detection sensitivity was increased up to 400 folds. The method is sensitive with the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) values of 0.002-0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Comparisons of the performance of twins labeling derivatization and traditional chemical isotope labeling (CIL) derivatization verified the ability of our method in the absolute quantification. The established method was applied to human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and its cisplatin resistant derivative A549/DDP. Significant shifts in 12 metabolites as well as 9 modified-to-prototypical ratios in A549/DDP were observed, demonstrating the utility of our method and the potential role of modified metabolites in mediating anticancer drug resistance. The method can be easily extended to determine other types of modified metabolites in various biological matrices, which will greatly expand our knowledge on these metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Emerging technologies such as digital twins, blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) play a vital role in driving the industrial revolution in all domains, including the healthcare sector. As a result of COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, there is a significant need for medical cyber-physical systems to adopt these emerging technologies to combat COVID-19 paramedic crisis. Also, acquiring secure real-time data exchange and analysis across multiple participants is essential to support the efforts against COVID-19. Therefore, we have introduced a blockchain-based collaborative digital twins framework for decentralized epidemic alerting to combat COVID-19 and any future pandemics. The framework has been proposed to bring together the existing advanced technologies (i.e., blockchain, digital twins, and AI) and then provide a solution to decentralize epidemic alerting to combat COVID-19 outbreaks. Also, we have described how the conceptual framework can be applied in the decentralized COVID-19 pandemic alerting use case.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that dramatically impacted human lives and economic activities. Due to the high risk of getting affected in high-density population areas and the implementation of national emergency measures under the COVID-19 pandemic, both travel and transportation among cities become difficult for engineers and equipment. Consequently, the costly physical commissioning of a new manufacturing system is greatly hindered. As an emerging technology, digital twins can achieve semi-physical simulation to avoid the vast cost of physical commissioning of the manufacturing system. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning (DT-RSPC) approach for open architecture flow-type smart manufacturing systems. A digital twin system is developed to enable the remote semi-physical commissioning. The proposed approach is validated through a case study of digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning of a smartphone assembly line. The results showed that combining the open architecture design paradigm with the proposed digital twins-based approach makes the commissioning of a new flow-type smart manufacturing system more sustainable.",

    "abstract": "In the general population, 10.6% of people favor their left hand over the right for motor tasks. Previous research suggests higher prevalence of atypical (left-, mixed-, or non-right-) handedness in (i) twins compared to singletons, and in (ii) monozygotic compared to dizygotic twins. Moreover, (iii) studies have shown a higher rate of handedness concordance in monozygotic compared to dizygotic twins, in line with genetic factors playing a role for handedness.\nBy means of a systematic review, we identified 59 studies from previous literature and performed three sets of random effects meta-analyses on (i) twin-to-singleton Odds Ratios (21 studies, n\u2009=\u2009189,422 individuals) and (ii) monozygotic-to-dizygotic twin Odds Ratios (48 studies, n\u2009=\u200963,295 individuals), both times for prevalence of left-, mixed-, and non-right-handedness. For monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs we compared (iii) handedness concordance Odds Ratios (44 studies, n\u2009=\u200936,217 twin pairs). We also tested for potential effects of moderating variables, such as sex, age, the method used to assess handedness, and the twins' zygosity.\nWe found (i) evidence for higher prevalence of left- (Odds Ratio\u2009=\u20091.40, 95% Confidence Interval\u2009=\u2009[1.26, 1.57]) and non-right- (Odds Ratio\u2009=\u20091.36, 95% Confidence Interval\u2009=\u2009[1.22, 1.52]), but not mixed-handedness (Odds Ratio\u2009=\u20091.08, 95% Confidence Interval\u2009=\u2009[0.52, 2.27]) among twins compared to singletons. We further showed a decrease in Odds Ratios in more recent studies (post-1975: Odds Ratio\u2009=\u20091.30, 95% Confidence Interval\u2009=\u2009[1.17, 1.45]) compared to earlier studies (pre-1975: Odds Ratio\u2009=\u20091.90, 95% Confidence Interval\u2009=\u2009[1.59-2.27]). While there was (ii) no difference between monozygotic and dizygotic twins regarding prevalence of left- (Odds Ratio\u2009=\u20090.98, 95% Confidence Interval\u2009=\u2009[0.89, 1.07]), mixed- (Odds Ratio\u2009=\u20090.96, 95% Confidence Interval\u2009=\u2009[0.46, 1.99]), or non-right-handedness (Odds Ratio\u2009=\u20091.01, 95% Confidence Interval\u2009=\u2009[0.91, 1.12]), we found that (iii) handedness concordance was elevated among monozygotic compared to dizygotic twin pairs (Odds Ratio\u2009=\u20091.11, 95% Confidence Interval\u2009=\u2009[1.06, 1.18]). By means of moderator analyses, we did not find evidence for effects of potentially confounding variables.\nWe provide the largest and most comprehensive meta-analysis on handedness in twins. Although a raw, unadjusted analysis found a higher prevalence of left- and non-right-, but not mixed-handedness among twins compared to singletons, left-handedness was substantially more prevalent in earlier than in more recent studies. The single large, recent study which included birth weight, Apgar score and gestational age as covariates found no twin-singleton difference in handedness rate, but these covariates could not be included in the present meta-analysis. Together, the secular shift and the influence of covariates probably make it unsafe to conclude that twinning has a genuine relationship to handedness.",

    "abstract": "Unilateral high-axial myopia can be associated with amblyopia and relative proptosis due to elongation of the eye and staphyloma formation. It is important to consider addressing any relative proptosis at the time of a lower eyelid blepharoplasty as the proptotic eye often creates a significant negative vector and increases the likelihood of postoperative retraction and scleral show. We present twin sisters who presented for a lower eyelid blepharoplasty evaluation; each sister had unilateral proptosis with high-axial myopia. Both underwent bilateral lower eyelid blepharoplasty and unilateral fat decompression in the proptotic eye. One sister required additional medial wall bony decompression to resolve the proptosis at the time of the aforementioned surgery. Therefore, it is important to consider globe position and degree of proptosis at the time of lower eyelid blepharoplasty surgery to optimize surgical results.",

    "abstract": "Tau accumulation starts during the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease and is closely associated with cognitive decline. For preventive purposes, it is important to identify factors associated with tau accumulation and spread. Studying genetically identical twin-pairs may give insight into genetic and environmental contributions to tau pathology, as similarities in identical twin-pairs largely result from genetic factors, while differences in identical twin-pairs can largely be attributed to non-shared, environmental factors. This study aimed to examine similarities and dissimilarities in a cohort of genetically identical older twin-pairs in (i) tau load; and (ii) spatial distribution of tau, measured with 18F-flortaucipir PET. We selected 78 genetically identical twins (39 pairs; average age 73 \u00b1 6 years), enriched for amyloid-\u03b2 pathology and APOE \u03b54 carriership, who underwent dynamic 18F-flortaucipir PET. We extracted binding potentials (BPND) in entorhinal, temporal, widespread neocortical and global regions, and examined within-pair similarities in BPND using age and sex corrected intra-class correlations. Furthermore, we tested whether twin-pairs showed a more similar spatial 18F-flortaucipir distribution compared to non-twin pairs, and whether the participant's co-twin could be identified solely based on the spatial 18F-flortaucipir distribution. Last, we explored whether environmental (e.g. physical activity, obesity) factors could explain observed differences in twins of a pair in 18F-flortaucipir BPND. On visual inspection, Alzheimer's disease-like 18F-flortaucipir PET patterns were observed, and although we mainly identified similarities in twin-pairs, some pairs showed strong dissimilarities. 18F-flortaucipir BPND was correlated in twins in the entorhinal (r = 0.40; P = 0.01), neocortical (r = 0.59; P < 0.01) and global (r = 0.56; P < 0.01) regions, but not in the temporal region (r = 0.20; P = 0.10). The 18F-flortaucipir distribution pattern was significantly more similar between twins of the same pair [mean r = 0.27; standard deviation (SD) = 0.09] than between non-twin pairings of participants (mean r = 0.01; SD = 0.10) (P < 0.01), also after correcting for proxies of off-target binding. Based on the spatial 18F-flortaucipir distribution, we could identify with an accuracy of 86% which twins belonged to the same pair. Finally, within-pair differences in 18F-flortaucipir BPND were associated with within-pair differences in depressive symptoms (0.37 < \u03b2 < 0.56), physical activity (-0.41 < \u03b2 < -0.42) and social activity (-0.32 < \u03b2 < -0.36) (all P < 0.05). Overall, identical twin-pairs were comparable in tau load and spatial distribution, highlighting the important role of genetic factors in the accumulation and spreading of tau pathology. Considering also the presence of dissimilarities in tau pathology in identical twin-pairs, our results additionally support a role for (potentially modifiable) environmental factors in the onset of Alzheimer's disease pathological processes, which may be of interest for future prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "A consensus definition of selective fetal growth restriction in monochorionic diamniotic twins was recently proposed following a Delphi procedure involving an international panel of experts. The new definition augments the traditional definition with additional sonographic criteria.\nWe sought to determine whether the augmentations of the \"Delphi definition\" identified additional morbidity and mortality compared with a traditional definition. Furthermore, we sought to determine the benefit of each definition in identifying pathologic growth restriction relative to uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic twins.\nThis was a retrospective analysis of unselected monochorionic diamniotic twins that underwent fortnightly ultrasound surveillance at a single center between 2011 and 2020. Patients with concomitant twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, twin anemia polycythemia sequence, or twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence at the time of diagnosis of selective fetal growth restriction were excluded. The diagnosis of selective fetal growth restriction using the Delphi definition required either an estimated fetal weight of <3rd percentile or presence of 2 of 4 observations in the smaller twin: (1) estimated fetal weight of <10th percentile, (2) estimated fetal weight discordance of >25% compared with the larger twin, (3) abdominal circumference of <10th percentile, (4) umbilical artery pulsatility index of >95th percentile. Diagnosis using the traditional definition required an estimated fetal weight of <10th percentile and an estimated fetal weight discordance of >25%. To determine the efficacy of the augmentations in the Delphi definition, 3 groups were compared: group I, uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic twins; group II, twins with selective fetal growth restriction using the traditional definition (and therefore the Delphi definition); and group III, twins with selective fetal growth restriction solely using the Delphi definition. Demographic characteristics, subsequent development of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome or twin anemia polycythemia sequence, pregnancy outcomes, and neonatal outcomes were compared.\nThere were 325 patients with monochorionic diamniotic twins that met inclusion criteria. Of these, 213 (66%; group I) were uncomplicated, 37 (11%; group II) met the traditional definition for selective fetal growth restriction, and 112 (35%) met the Delphi definition for selective fetal growth restriction with 75 (67%) meeting solely the Delphi definition (group III). Demographic characteristics were similar between groups. Patients in group II delivered earlier than uncomplicated twins (32.1 vs 35.7 weeks of gestation; P<.01) and patients in group III (32.1 vs 35.6 weeks of gestation; P<.01). Furthermore, they were more likely to have critical umbilical artery Doppler abnormalities (38% vs 4%; P<.01) and be delivered for deteriorating fetal status (30% vs 5%; P<.01) than those in group III. Overall, survival was lower in group II than groups I and III (89% vs 96% and 100%, respectively; P=.04). Moreover, composite neonatal morbidity and mortality were greater in group II (30%) than either group I (6%; P<.01) or group III (9%; P<.01). The rates of composite neonatal morbidity and mortality were similar between groups I and III (P=.28).\nThe addition of abdominal circumference and umbilical artery pulsatility index thresholds and isolated estimated fetal weight of <3%, as proposed by the Delphi definition, increased the diagnosis of selective fetal growth restriction; however, there was no added benefit in the identification of growth discordant pregnancies at risk of adverse outcomes. Prospective analysis of monochorionic diamniotic twins is required to contextualize these findings.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation of untreated monozygotic and dizygotic twins was to identify the genetic and environmental components to the facial soft tissue growth.\nThe sample consisted of 52 untreated monozygotic twins (36 male and 16 female) and 46 untreated dizygotic twins (23 male and 23 female) from the Forsyth Moorrees Twin Study (1959-1975).\nLateral cephalograms were taken at 12 and 17\u00a0years of age and traced to analyse facial convexity, nasolabial angle, upper and lower lip thickness, upper and lower lip profile and nose prominence. The genetic and environmental components of variance were analysed with structural equation modelling for multilevel mixed-effects model.\nAt 12\u00a0years of age, strong additive genetic influence was seen for facial convexity (70%), upper lip profile (66%) and nose prominence (65%), whereas strong dominant genetic components were found for upper lip thickness (56%). Nevertheless, under unique environment influence were nasolabial angle (58%), lower lip profile (51%) and lower lip thickness (64%). At 17\u00a0years of age, only upper lip thickness (55%) and nose prominence (84%) were under strong additive genetic control, while the rest of the variables were under strong dominant genetic control. The only exception was lower lip thickness (61%), which is still influenced by the unique environment.\nAlthough monozygotic/dizygotic twins share at least part of their genome, at both times either additive, dominant or environmental components were found. Nevertheless, at 17\u00a0years of age most of the variables are either under additive or dominant genetic influence.",

The patient presented to our department with initial diagnosis which was confirmed during ultrasound examination at 12 weeks - uterus didelphys with dichorionic diamniotic twin gestation. Further ultrasound scans were performed every 4 weeks and revealed small for gestational age fetuses. Due to the uterine malformation and the history of cesarean section, the patient was qualified for an elective cesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation - two premature neonates were delivered in good general conditions.",

    "abstract": "Up until now, no study has looked specifically at epigenomic landscapes throughout twin samples, discordant for Anorexia nervosa (AN). Our goal was to find evidence to confirm the hypothesis that epigenetic variations play a key role in the aetiology of AN. In this study, we quantified genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation using the Infinium Human DNA Methylation EPIC BeadChip array (\"850\u2009K\") in DNA samples isolated from whole blood collected from a group of 7 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for AN. Results were then validated performing a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling using DNA extracted from whole blood of a group of non-family-related AN patients and a group of healthy controls. Our first analysis using the twin sample revealed 9 CpGs associated to a gene. The validation analysis showed two statistically significant CpGs with the rank regression method related to two genes associated to metabolic traits, PPP2R2C and CHST1. When doing beta regression, 6 of them showed statistically significant differences, including 3 CpGs associated to genes JAM3, UBAP2L and SYNJ2. Finally, the overall pattern of results shows genetic links to phenotypes which the literature has constantly related to AN, including metabolic and psychological traits. The genes PPP2R2C and CHST1 have both been linked to the metabolic traits type 2 diabetes through GWAS studies. The genes UBAP2L and SYNJ2 have been related to other psychiatric comorbidity.",

    "abstract": "The food industry faces many challenges, including the need to feed a growing population, food loss and waste, and inefficient production systems. To cope with those challenges, digital twins that create a digital representation of physical entities by integrating real-time and real-world data seem to be a promising approach. This paper aims to provide an overview of digital twin applications in the food industry and analyze their challenges and potentials. Therefore, a literature review is executed to examine digital twin applications in the food supply chain. The applications found are classified according to a taxonomy and key elements to implement digital twins are identified. Further, the challenges and potentials of digital twin applications in the food industry are discussed. The survey revealed that the application of digital twins mainly targets the production (agriculture) or the food processing stage. Nearly all applications are used for monitoring and many for prediction. However, only a small amount focuses on the integration in systems for autonomous control or providing recommendations to humans. The main challenges of implementing digital twins are combining multidisciplinary knowledge and providing enough data. Nevertheless, digital twins provide huge potentials, e.g., in determining food quality, traceability, or designing personalized foods.",

    "abstract": "Unequal placental territory in monochorionic diamniotic twins is a primary cause of selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR), and vascular anastomoses play important role in determining sFGR prognosis. This study investigated differences in placental characteristics and pregnancy outcomes in cases of sFGR with and without thick arterio-arterial anastomosis (AAA).\nA total of 253 patients diagnosed with sFGR between April 2013 and April 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. An AAA greater than 2 mm in diameter was defined as a thick AAA. We compared placental characteristics and pregnancy outcomes between cases of sFGR with and without thick AAA.\nPrevalence of AAA, thick arterio-venous anastomosis (AVA), veno-venous anastomosis (VVA), and thick VVA were significantly higher in the thick AAA group relative to the non-thick AAA group (100.0 vs. 78.5%, P < 0.001; 44.3 vs. 15.4%, P < 0.001; 27.1 vs. 10.8%, P = 0.017, and 24.3 vs. 6.2%, P = 0.004, respectively). The total numbers of AVA and total anastomoses were significantly higher in thick AAA group relative to the non-thick AAA group (5 [1, 14] vs. 3 [1, 15, P = 0.016; and 6 [1, 15] vs. 5 [1, 16], P = 0.022, respectively). The total diameter of AAA, AVA, VVA, and all anastomoses in the thick AAA group was larger than in the non-thick AAA group (3.4 [2.0,7.1] vs. 1.4 [0.0, 3.3], P < 0.001; 6.3 [0.3, 12.0] vs. 2.5 [0.3, 17.8], P < 0.001; 4.2\u00b11.8 vs. 1.9\u00b11.2, P =0.004; and 10.7 [3.2,22.4] vs. 4.4 [0.5, 19.3], P < 0.001, respectively). Growth-restricted fetuses in the thick AAA group exhibited significantly increased birthweight relative to those in thenon-thick AAA group (1570 (530, 2460)g vs. 1230 (610, 2480)g, p = 0.002).\nIn the placentas associated with sFGR, thick AAA can co-occur with thick AVA and VVA, and placental angiogenesis may differ significantly based upon whether or not thick AAA is present. The birth weights of growth-restricted fetuses in cases of sFGR with thick AAA are larger than in cases without thick AAA.",

    "abstract": "Genetic analysis of leukemic clones in monozygotic twins with concordant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has proved a unique opportunity to gain insight into the molecular phylogenetics of leukemogenesis. Using whole-genome sequencing, we characterized constitutional and somatic single nucleotide variants/insertion-deletions (indels) and structural variants in a monozygotic twin pair with concordant ETV6-RUNX1+ B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL). In addition, digital PCR (dPCR) was applied to evaluate the presence of and quantify selected somatic variants at birth, diagnosis, and remission. A shared somatic complex rearrangement involving chromosomes 11, 12, and 21 with identical fusion sequences in leukemias of both twins offered direct proof of a common clonal origin. The ETV6-RUNX1 fusion detected at diagnosis was found to originate from this complex rearrangement. A shared somatic frameshift deletion in UBA2 was also identified in diagnostic samples. In addition, each leukemia independently acquired analogous deletions of 3 genes recurrently targeted in BCP-ALLs (ETV6, ATF7IP, and RAG1/RAG2), providing evidence of a convergent clonal evolution only explained by a strong concurrent selective pressure. Quantification of the UBA2 deletion by dPCR surprisingly indicated it persisted in remission. This, for the first time to our knowledge, provided evidence of a UBA2 variant preceding the well-established initiating event ETV6-RUNX1. Further, we suggest the UBA2 deletion exerted a leukemia predisposing effect and that its essential role in Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) attachment (SUMOylation), regulating nearly all physiological and pathological cellular processes such as DNA-repair by nonhomologous end joining, may hold a mechanistic explanation for the predisposition.",

    "abstract": "The risk of revision surgery following total joint arthroplasty (TJA) may be influenced by genetic factors. Therefore, we sought to identify genetic variants associated with the risk of revision surgery in a genomewide association study.\nWe investigated a cohort of 1,130 twins from the Swedish Twin Registry treated with TJA. During a mean of 9.4 years of follow-up, 75 individuals underwent revision surgery for aseptic loosening (the primary outcome) and 94, for any reason (the secondary outcome). Genetic information was collected using the Illumina OmniExpress and PsychArray panels, and the Haplotype Reference Consortium served as the reference for gene imputation. Adjusted Cox regression models were fitted to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nNine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reached genomewide significance for aseptic loosening. The first SNP, rs77149046, located in the endosome-lysosome associated apoptosis and autophagy regulator family member 2 (ELAPOR2) gene, conferred an HR of 5.40 (CI, 3.23-9.02; p = 1.32\u00d710 -10 ), followed by 4 SNPs within the region coding for sodium-dependent taurine and beta-alanine transporter (SLC6A6), with HRs ranging from 3.35 to 3.43. The sixth SNP, rs7853989 (HR, 3.46; CI, 2.33-5.13; p = 6.91\u00d710 -10 ), was located in a region coding for the ABO blood group system. This SNP has been described as predictive for blood type B. Seven significant SNPs were found for the risk of revision for any reason, with the first 4 again being located in the SLC6A6 region. The leading SNP, rs62233562, conferred an HR of 3.11 (CI, 2.19-4.40; p = 1.74\u00d710 -10 ) for revision surgery. Similar HRs were found for SNPs 3:14506680 (p = 1.78\u00d710 -10 ), rs2289129 (p = 1.78\u00d710 -10 ), and rs17309567 (p = 3.16\u00d710 -10 ). The fifth SNP, rs11120968, was located in the calmodulin-binding transcription activator 1 (CAMTA1) gene (HR, 2.34; CI, 1.74-3.13, p = 1.45\u00d710 -8 ).\nWe identified 12 unique SNPs associated with an increased risk of revision surgery. Among these, 2 were in ELAPOR2, which is closely linked to bone formation. Another SNP is located in a gene region encoding for the ABO system, which merits further studies of causal relationships.\nPrognostic Level III .

    "abstract": "Our study presents a novel germline c.1715G>T (p.G572V) mutation in the gene encoding Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) causing an autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorder in a family with monozygotic male twins, who suffer from severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia worsening with infections, and autoinflammation presenting as fevers, enteritis, arthritis, and CNS vasculitis. The pathogenicity of the mutation was confirmed by in vitro assays on transfected cell lines and primary cells. The p.G572V mutation causes impaired stability of the TLR8 protein, cross-reactivity to TLR7 ligands and reduced ability of TLR8 to attenuate TLR7 signaling. This imbalance toward TLR7-dependent signaling leads to increased pro-inflammatory responses, such as nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1. This unique TLR8 mutation with partial TLR8 protein loss and hyperinflammatory phenotype mediated by TLR7 ligands represents a novel inborn error of immunity with childhood-onset and a good response to TLR7 inhibition.",

    "abstract": "The Reference Construction Site Aachen West, located in Aachen, Germany, is a campus-based living lab for research and university education in construction. To ensure and improve the education quality, this paper researches a new study tool in the form of a digital twin framework powered by the Unreal Engine. By implementing MQTT, an IoT communication protocol, the digital twin realizes synchronicity of cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Representing the virtual Reference Construction Site, an online multiplayer application was developed as a use case to answer the research questions: (1) how to design the digital twin and structure in an extendable and accessible development framework for different users and (2) how to support education in construction with this digital twin. To validate the concept, a group of students were invited online to explore the application and provide user feedback. Results show positive effects of the digital twin on enhancing the quality of the online education in construction with its real-time interaction and data from on-site machinery and processes. The digital twin is planned to be transferred to research and construction projects.",

    "abstract": "The beta-actin gene (ACTB) encodes a ubiquitous cytoskeletal protein, essential for embryonic development in humans. De novo heterozygous missense variants in the ACTB are implicated in causing Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome (BWCFFS; MIM#243310). ACTB pathogenic variants are rarely associated with intestinal malformations. We report on a rare case of monozygotic twins presenting with proximal small bowel atresia and hydrops in one, and apple-peel bowel atresia and laryngeal dysgenesis in the other. The twin with hydrops could not be resuscitated. Intensive and surgical care was provided to the surviving twin. Rapid trio genome sequencing identified a de novo missense variant in ACTB (NM_00101.3:c.1043C>T; p.(Ser348Leu)) that guided the care plan. The identical variant subsequently was identified in the demised twin. To characterize the functional effect, the variant was recreated as a pseudoheterozygote in a haploid wild-type S. cerevisiae strain. There was an obvious growth defect of the yACT1",

    "abstract": "In this work, the structures of chemically related uranyl-oxide minerals agrinierite and rameauite have been revisited and some corrections to the available structure data are provided. Both structures were found to be twinned. The two minerals are chemically similar, and though their structures differ considerably, their unit-cell metrics are similar. Agrinierite was found to be twinned by metric merohedry (diffraction type I), whereas the structure of rameauite is twinned by reticular merohedry (diffraction type II). The twinning of the monoclinic unit cells (true cells) leads to pseudo-orthorhombic or pseudo-tetragonal supercells in the single-crystal diffraction patterns of both minerals. According to the new data and refinement, agrinierite is monoclinic (space group ",

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multisystem, autoimmune inflammatory disease with genomic and non-genomic contributions to risk. We hypothesize that epigenetic factors are a significant contributor to SLE risk and may be informative for identifying pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets. To test this hypothesis while controlling for genetic background, we performed an epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in genomic DNA from whole blood in three pairs of female monozygotic (MZ) twins of European ancestry, discordant for SLE. Results were replicated on the same array in four cell types from a set of four Danish female MZ twin pairs discordant for SLE. Genes implicated by the epigenetic analyses were then evaluated in 10 independent SLE gene expression datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). There were 59 differentially methylated loci between unaffected and affected MZ twins in whole blood, including 11 novel loci. All but two of these loci were hypomethylated in the SLE twins relative to the unaffected twins. The genes harboring these hypomethylated loci exhibited increased expression in multiple independent datasets of SLE patients. This pattern was largely consistent regardless of disease activity, cell type, or renal tissue type. The genes proximal to CpGs exhibiting differential methylation (DM) in the SLE-discordant MZ twins and exhibiting differential expression (DE) in independent SLE GEO cohorts (DM-DE genes) clustered into two pathways: the nucleic acid-sensing pathway and the type I interferon pathway. The DM-DE genes were also informatically queried for potential gene-drug interactions, yielding a list of 41 drugs including a known SLE therapy. The DM-DE genes delineate two important biologic pathways that are not only reflective of the heterogeneity of SLE but may also correlate with distinct IFN responses that depend on the source, type, and location of nucleic acid molecules and the activated receptors in individual patients. Cell- and tissue-specific analyses will be critical to the understanding of genetic factors dysregulating the nucleic acid-sensing and IFN pathways and whether these factors could be appropriate targets for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a widespread severe neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by pronounced deficiency of the dopaminergic system and disruption of the function of other neuromodulator systems. Although heritable genetic factors contribute significantly to PD pathogenesis, only a small percentage of sporadic cases of PD can be explained using known genetic risk factors. Due to that, it could be inferred that changes in gene expression could be important for explaining a significant percentage of PD cases. One of the ways to investigate such changes, while minimizing the effect of genetic factors on experiment, are the study of PD discordant monozygotic twins. In the course of the analysis of transcriptome data obtained from IPSC and NPCs, 20 and 1906 differentially expressed genes were identified respectively. We have observed an overexpression of ",

    "abstract": "To determine if recent evolutions in laboratory protocols, including the increased use of natural cycles and the use of a hyaluronan-containing transfer medium, affected the rate of monozygotic twin (MZT) pregnancies after single frozen embryo transfer (FET).\nRetrospective cohort study.\nUrban university-based fertility center.\nPatients who underwent single FET between January 2016 and December 2018 resulting in an intrauterine pregnancy.\nTransition to a transfer protocol with a hyaluronan-containing transfer medium in July\u00a02017.\nNumber of MZT pregnancies.\nThere were 1,619 cycles that met the inclusion criteria and 31 (1.9%) resulted in MZT pregnancies. A hyaluronan-containing transfer medium was used in 875 (54.1%) cycles. Programmed cycles were used for 1,385 (85.5%) FETs and 234 (14.5%) cycles were natural. The mean age at FET, oocyte age, endometrial echo thickness, inner cell mass grade, trophectoderm grade, expansion, and day of blastocyst vitrification were similar between the groups. The use of a hyaluronan-containing transfer medium resulted in fewer MZTs. After controlling potential confounders with a multivariate regression, the use of the hyaluronan-containing medium still resulted in fewer MZTs. Monozygotic twins were colinear with preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), so PGT was excluded as a variable in our regression. A regression of PGT only cycles showed that the use of the hyaluronan-containing medium was still associated with a reduction in MZT pregnancies.\nThe use of a hyaluronan-containing transfer medium was associated with a lower rate of MZTs. Other clinical parameters, including cycle type, were not associated with changes in the number of MZTs. The use of PGT needs to be further investigated as a risk factor for MZTs.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins (CTs) are a rare complication from monochorionic and monoamniotic twin pregnancies. We describe the use of 3D technologies, including 3D virtual and 3D physical models on prenatal evaluation of one parapagus CT. A 16-year-old G1P0 woman was referred for fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) anatomical evaluation of a CT at 28 weeks of gestation. 3D images of the fetal surface were generated by the software during the examination for spatial comprehension of the relationship between the fetal parts.

    "abstract": "Exposure to airborne microorganisms has been linked to the development of health detriments, particularly in children. Microbial pollution can constitute a relevant health concern indoors, where levels of airborne microorganisms may be specially increased. This work aimed to characterize the airborne bacterial levels, and fungal concentration and diversity to which twins are exposed in their bedrooms (n\u00a0=\u00a030) during the first year of life. Bacterial and fungal levels varied widely across the studied bedrooms, with 10% of the rooms presenting values exceeding the national limit for both indoor bacterial and fungal counts. Cladosporium was the predominant genera, but Penicillium, Aspergillus, Alternaria, Trichoderma and Chrysonilia were also identified in the samples collected. In addition, two toxicogenic species, A. flavus and T. viride, were identified at counts that exceeded the established limit (12\u00a0CFU/m",

    "abstract": "Fetal growth restriction (FGR) may alter brain development permanently, resulting in lifelong structural and functional changes. However, in studies addressing this research question, FGR singletons have been compared primarily to matched appropriately grown singletons, a design which is inherently biased by differences in genetic and maternal factors. To overcome these limitations, we conducted a within-pair comparison of neonatal structural cerebral ultrasound measurements in monochorionic twin pairs with selective FGR (sFGR).\nStructural cerebral measurements on neonatal cerebral ultrasound were compared between the smaller and larger twins of monochorionic twin pairs with sFGR, defined as a birth-weight discordance (BWD) \u2265\u200920%, born in our center between 2010 and 2020. Measurements from each twin pair were also compared with those of an appropriately grown singleton, matched according to sex and gestational age at birth.\nIncluded were 58 twin pairs with sFGR, with a median gestational age at birth of 31.7 (interquartile range, 29.9-33.8)\u2009weeks and a median birth weight of 1155\u2009g for the smaller twin and 1725\u2009g for the larger twin (median BWD, 32%). Compared with both the larger twin and the singleton, the smaller twin had significantly smaller cerebral structures (corpus callosum, vermis, cerebellum), less white/deep gray matter and smaller intracranial surface area and volume. Intracranial-volume discordance and BWD correlated significantly (R\nIn monochorionic twins with sFGR, neonatal cerebral ultrasound reveals an overall, proportional restriction in brain growth, with smaller cerebral structures, less white/deep gray matter and smaller overall brain-size parameters in the smaller twin. There was a positive linear relationship between BWD and intracranial-volume discordance, with intracranial-volume discordance being smaller than BWD. \u00a9 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.",

    "abstract": "This article describes the Australian Twins Economic Preferences Survey (ATEPS). The data set comprises a wide variety of preference and behavioral measures (risk aversion, impatience, ambiguity aversion, trust, confidence) elicited using incentivized decision tasks. One-thousand one-hundred twenty Australian adult twins (560 pairs) completed the survey, making it one of the largest data sets containing incentivized preference measures of twins. As the survey was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we also collected information on experiences related to the pandemic, along with a variety of questions on political attitudes and mental wellbeing. We hope that ATEPS can make a valuable contribution to social science and genetics research.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to natural environments, known as greenspace, appears to positively influence health, yet the mechanisms are unclear. Given that gut microbiota are associated with inflammatory disorders more prevalent in urban areas and individuals with lower greenspace exposure, microbiota may act as a mediator between greenspace and health. Using 2443 participants of the TwinsUK cohort, microbiota differences were compared in relation to rural/urban living and with quantiles of area-level greenspace at three different neighbourhood distances: 800\u00a0m, 3000\u00a0m and 5000\u00a0m. Using microbiota data captured from faecal samples using 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing, small compositional differences in association with 3000\u00a0m greenspace (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) in models adjusted for confounders of microbiota variance (sequencing depth, antibiotics use, body mass index, frailty, age, diet, region and socioeconomic variables) were observed. Differences in abundances of genus were observed for all measures of greenspace in adjusted models; a key pathogenic genus was increased in abundance in association with urbanicity (Escherichia/Shigella, logFC\u00a0=\u00a00.73742, padj <0.001). Further, utilising the twin structure, within-pair differences in microbiota composition were compared and associations with 800\u00a0m greenspace observed (factor level significance in association with greatest difference, \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.08, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0162) as were differences in Escherichia/Shigella. The microbiota signature of those with a greater exposure to greenspace, but not necessarily explicitly rural individuals, was distinct from other individuals, suggesting microbiota as a potential mediator for greenspace and health.",

    "abstract": "Zimmermann-Laband syndrome is a rare, heterogeneous disorder characterized by gingival hypertrophy or fibromatosis, aplastic/hypoplastic nails, hypoplasia of the distal phalanges, hypertrichosis, various degrees of intellectual disability, and distinctive facial features. Three genes are considered causative for ZLS: KCNH1, KCNN3, and ATP6V1B2. We report on a pair of female concordant monozygotic twins, both carrying a novel pathogenic variant in the KCNN3 gene, identified using exome sequencing. Only six ZLS patients with the KCNN3 pathogenic variant have been reported so far. The twins show facial dysmorphism, hypoplastic distal phalanges, aplasia or hypoplasia of nails, and hypertrichosis. During infancy, they showed mild developmental delays, mainly speech. They successfully completed secondary school education and are socio-economically independent. Gingival overgrowth is absent in both individuals. Our patients exhibited an unusually mild phenotype compared to published cases, which is an important diagnostic finding for proper genetic counseling for Zimmermann-Laband syndrome patients and their families.",

    "abstract": "To compare latency to delivery and perinatal outcomes between twin and singleton pregnancies undergoing physical examination-indicated cerclage.\nRetrospective observational study (2007-2017) of women who underwent physical examination-indicated cerclage at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. Primary outcomes were latency from cerclage to delivery and gestational age at delivery. Secondary outcomes included: neonatal morbidity and mortality, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, clinical chorioamnionitis and cerclage displacement. Wilcoxon-test and \u03c7\nSixty women were included (17 twins and 43\u00a0singletons). There were no differences in gestational age at cerclage or presence of bulging membranes between groups. Median (25th;75th percentile) gestational age at delivery was 27.1 (24.5;32.3) weeks in the twin group and 27.6 (25.3;35.3) weeks in the singleton group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.594). There were no statistically significant differences in latency from cervical cerclage to delivery between the two groups (43\u00a0days [21;64] vs. 29\u00a0days [16;76], respectively; P\u00a0=\u00a00.938). There were no differences in neonatal mortality (2/26 [7.7%] vs. 1/33 [3.1%]; P\u00a0=\u00a00.578) or in composite neonatal morbidity (14 [53.9%] vs. 14 [42.4%]; P\u00a0=\u00a00.283) between groups, respectively.\nThese results suggest that physical examination-indicated cerclage placement in twins could prolong latency to delivery similarly to singleton pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Induction motors play a key role in the industrial sector. Thus, the correct diagnosis and classification of faults on these machines are important, even in the initial stages of evolution. Such analysis allows for increased productivity, avoids unexpected process interruptions, and prevents damage to machines. Usually, fault diagnosis is carried out by analyzing the characteristic effects caused by the faults. Thus, it is necessary to know and understand the behavior during the operation of the faulty machine. In general, monitoring these characteristics is complex, as it is necessary to acquire signals from the same motor with and without failures for comparison purposes. Whether in an industrial environment or in laboratories, the experimental characterization of failures can become unfeasible for several reasons. Thus, computer simulation of faulty motors digital twins can be an important alternative for failure analysis, especially in large motors. From this perspective, this paper presents and discusses several limitations found in the technical literature that can be minimized with the implementation of digital twins. In addition, a 3D finite element model of an induction motor with broken rotor bars is demonstrated, and motor current signature analysis is used to verify the fault effects. Results are analyzed in the time and frequency domain. Additionally, an artificial neural network of the multilayer perceptron type is used to classify the failure of broken bars in the 3D model rotor.",

    "abstract": "Twins regularly score nearly a standard deviation below the population mean on standardized measures of cognitive development in infancy but recover to the population mean by early childhood, making rapid gains through the toddler years. To date, only polynomial growth models have been fit to model cognitive recovery across childhood, limiting the applicability of the growth parameters to later developmental periods. We fit a nonlinear asymptotic Gompertz growth model to prospective cognitive scores from 1,153 individual twins from 578 families (47.9% male, 91.5% White, 61.6% monozygotic) measured at 16 time points between 3 months and 15 years. Twins displayed a lower asymptote of 86.47 (.90 ",

    "abstract": "We report a case of a monochorionic diamniotic twin with an uncomplicated pregnancy, but with an unexpected large intertwin hemoglobin (Hb) difference at birth. Twin 1 was delivered vaginally and had an uneventful neonatal course. The umbilical cord of Twin 1 was clamped approximately 5 min after birth. After the birth of Twin 1, Twin 2 developed severe bradycardia and showed limited cardiac output on ultrasound, for which an emergency cesarean section was performed. A full blood count revealed an Hb of 20.1 g/dL for Twin 1 and 10.2 g/dL for Twin 2 (intertwin difference 9.9 g/dL). Reticulocyte counts were similar, 40\u2030 and 38\u2030, respectively. Placental examination revealed 10 vascular anastomoses, including one arterio-arterial anastomosis with a diameter of 1.4 mm. Additionally, a large chorangioma was present on the placental surface of Twin 2. There was no color difference on the maternal side of the placenta. Based on the reticulocyte count ratio and the placental characteristics, twin anemia polycythemia sequence was ruled out as the cause of the large intertwin Hb difference. In this report, we discuss the various potential causes that could explain the large intertwin Hb difference including the role of delayed cord clamping in Twin 1, and the role of a large chorangioma, which may have attracted blood from the fetal circulation of Twin 2.",

    "abstract": "There is no unified treatment standard for patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL). Cancer neoantigens are the result of somatic mutations and cancer-specific. Increased number of somatic mutations are associated with anti-cancer effects. Screening out ENKTL-specific neoantigens on the surface of cancer cells relies on the understanding of ENKTL mutation patterns. Hence, it is imperative to identify ENKTL-specific genes for ENKTL diagnosis, the discovery of tumor-specific neoantigens and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. We investigated the gene signatures of ENKTL patients.\nWe collected the peripheral blood of a pair of twins for sequencing to identify unique variant genes. One of the twins is diagnosed with ENKTL. Seventy samples were analyzed by Robust Multi-array Analysis (RMA). Two methods (elastic net and Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination) were used to select unique genes. Next, we performed functional enrichment analysis and pathway enrichment analysis. Then, we conducted single-sample gene set enrichment analysis of immune infiltration and validated the expression of the screened markers with limma packages.\nWe screened out 126 unique variant genes. Among them, 11 unique genes were selected by the combination of elastic net and Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination. Subsequently, GO and KEGG analysis indicated the biological function of identified unique genes. GSEA indicated five immunity-related pathways with high signature scores. In patients with ENKTL and the group with high signature scores, a proportion of functional immune cells are all of great infiltration. We finally found that CDC27, ZNF141, FCGR2C and NES were four significantly differential genes in ENKTL patients. ZNF141, FCGR2C and NES were upregulated in patients with ENKTL, while CDC27 was significantly downregulated.\nWe identified four ENKTL markers (ZNF141, FCGR2C, NES and CDC27) in patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twins are generally considered to be monozygotic, as monochorionic dizygotic (MCDZ) twins are extremely rare in natural pregnancies. Several studies have reported this rare occurrence, and most of these pregnancies have been conceived by assisted reproductive technology (ART). These reports mostly focused on MCDZ twin pregnancies and the childhood development of the twins; a follow-up into adulthood and the effect on their reproduction has not been reported. In this case study, we report a case of chimerism in opposite-sex MCDZ twins who were naturally conceived and have reached reproductive maturity. We collected oral mucosal, endometrial, and germ cells from the twins and evaluated their chimerism using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The SNP array showed that they had 4,049 non-allele shared loci, and they inherited nearly 50% informative SNP loci from each parent, confirming that they are dizygotic twins. We found that the female twin had a 46, XX (2)/46, XY (78) karyotype in her peripheral blood. The SNP array confirmed that the female twin and male twin had the same blood haplotype. The ddPCR result showed 92.84 (\u00b1 1.80%) chimerism in her blood. In case of chimerism in her germline, the female twin chose preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy for her blastocysts. Fortunately, the patient only had blood chimerism. A healthy boy was born at 39\u00a0weeks of gestation.",

    "abstract": "Executive functions (EF) are a set of higher-order cognitive abilities that enable goal-directed behavior by controlling lower-level operations. In the brain, those functions have been traditionally associated with activity in the Frontoparietal Network, but recent neuroimaging studies have challenged this view in favor of more widespread cortical involvement. In the present study, we aimed to explore whether the network that serves as critical hubs at rest, which we term network reliance, differentiate individuals as a function of their level of EF. Furthermore, we investigated whether such differences are driven by genetic as compared to environmental factors. For this purpose, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data and the behavioral testing of 453 twins from the Colorado Longitudinal Twins Study were analyzed. Separate indices of EF performance were obtained according to a bifactor unity/diversity model, distinguishing between three independent components representing: Common EF, Shifting-specific and Updating-specific abilities. Through an approach of step-wise in silico network lesioning of the individual functional connectome, we show that interindividual differences in EF are associated with different dependencies on neural networks at rest. Furthermore, these patterns show evidence of mild heritability. Such findings add knowledge to the understanding of brain states at rest and their connection with human behavior, and how they might be shaped by genetic influences.",

    "abstract": "Breakthrough imaging technologies may challenge the plant phenotyping bottleneck regarding marker-assisted breeding and genetic mapping. In this context, X-Ray CT (computed tomography) technology can accurately obtain the digital twin of root system architecture (RSA) but computational methods to quantify RSA traits and analyze their changes over time are limited. RSA traits extremely affect agricultural productivity. We develop a spatial-temporal root architectural modeling method based on 4D data from X-ray CT. This novel approach is optimized for high-throughput phenotyping considering the cost-effective time to process the data and the accuracy and robustness of the results. Significant root architectural traits, including root elongation rate, number, length, growth angle, height, diameter, branching map, and volume of axial and lateral roots are extracted from the model based on the digital twin. Our pipeline is divided into two major steps: (i) first, we compute the curve-skeleton based on a constrained Laplacian smoothing algorithm. This skeletal structure determines the registration of the roots over time; (ii) subsequently, the RSA is robustly modeled by a cylindrical fitting to spatially quantify several traits. The experiment was carried out at the Ag Alumni Seed Phenotyping Facility (AAPF) from Purdue University in West Lafayette (IN, USA).\nRoots from three samples of tomato plants at two different times and three samples of corn plants at three different times were scanned. Regarding the first step, the PCA analysis of the skeleton is able to accurately and robustly register temporal roots. From the second step, several traits were computed. Two of them were accurately validated using the root digital twin as a ground truth against the cylindrical model: number of branches (RRMSE better than 9%) and volume, reaching a coefficient of determination (R\nThe experimental results support the viability of the developed methodology, being able to provide scalability to a comprehensive analysis in order to perform high throughput root phenotyping.",

    "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated research and development not only in infectious diseases but also in digital technologies to improve monitoring, forecasting, and intervening on planetary and ecological risks. In the European Commission, the Destination Earth (DestinE) is a current major initiative to develop a digital model of the Earth (a \"digital twin\") with high precision. Moreover, omics systems science is undergoing digital transformation impacting nearly all dimensions of the field, including real-time phenotype capture to data analytics using machine learning and artificial intelligence, to name but a few emerging frontiers. We discuss the ways in which the current ongoing digital transformation in omics offers synergies with digital twins/DestinE. Importantly, we note here the rise of a new field of scholarship, planetary health genomics. We conclude that digital transformation in public and private sectors, digital twins/DestinE, and their convergence with omics systems science are poised to build robust capacities for pandemic preparedness and resilient societies in the 21st century.",

    "abstract": "We analyze data from the Minnesota Twin Registry (MTR), combined with the Socioeconomic Survey of Twins (SST), and new mortality data, and contribute to two bodies of literature. First, we demonstrate a beneficial causal effect of education on health and longevity in contrast to other twin-based studies of the US population, which show little or no effect of education on health. Second, we present evidence that is consistent with parental compensation through education for differences in their children's endowments that predict health, but find no evidence that parents reinforce differences in endowments that predict earnings. We argue that there is a bias towards detecting reinforcement both in this paper and in the literature. Despite this bias, we still find statistical evidence of compensating behavior. We account for observed and unobserved confounding factors, sample selection bias, and measurement error in education.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have determined the epigenetic association between DNA methylation and pulmonary function among various ethnics, whereas this association is largely unknown in Chinese adults. Thus, we aimed to explore epigenetic relationships between genome-wide DNA methylation levels and pulmonary function among middle-aged Chinese monozygotic twins.\nThe monozygotic twin sample was drawn from the Qingdao Twin Registry. Pulmonary function was measured by three parameters including forced expiratory volume the first second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC ratio. Linear mixed effect model was used to regress the methylation level of CpG sites on pulmonary function. After that, we applied Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT) to predict the genomic regions enrichment, and used comb-p python library to detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Gene expression analysis was conducted to validate the results of differentially methylated analyses.\nWe identified 112 CpG sites with the level of P\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\nOur DNA methylation sequencing analysis on identical twins provides new references for the epigenetic regulation on pulmonary function. Several CpG sites, genes, biological pathways and DMRs are considered as possible crucial to pulmonary function.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the safety of vaginal delivery with a non-vertex second twin when the first twin is in the vertex presentation.\nA retrospective analysis was undertaken, utilizing a cohort of twin gestations in which the presenting twin was vertex and the second twin was either vertex (group A) or non-vertex (group B). We assessed maternal and neonatal outcomes including emergency cesarean delivery, 5-minute Apgar scores, cord arterial pH, NICU admissions, and adverse maternal postpartum outcomes including ICU admissions and the requirement of blood products.\nSix hundred and eighty-five women with a vertex presenting twin were admitted to labor and delivery. Three hundred and ninety-five women were included in group A (vertex/vertex) and 290 were included in group B (vertex/non-vertex). No statistically significant differences were found in the 5-minute Apgar scores, cord arterial pH, or in the rates of emergency cesarean deliveries, NICU admission, maternal blood transfusion or ICU admissions.\nIn conclusion, vaginal delivery of a breech second twin when the presenting twin is vertex was found as safe as vaginal delivery of twins in the vertex/vertex presentation.",

    "abstract": "Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) is a multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by tics and multiple comorbidities. The pathophysiology is not yet fully understood, but both environmental and genetic risk factors seem to be involved. Twin studies provide important knowledge on genetic factors. We assessed the concordance of GTS and chronic tic disorders (CTD) in monozygotic (MZ) twins, and examined tic severity, symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Twin pairs, where at least one twin was diagnosed with any tic disorder, were identified through Danish Twin Registry, Psychiatric Central Registry, Danish National Patient Registry and National Tourette Clinic, Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev. Zygosity was tested with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and clinical assessment was done with validated tools. 14 MZ twin pairs were included: five were discordant. Seven twin pairs were concordant for GTS, and for two pairs one twin had GTS and the other CTD. Among the twins with CTD or GTS, 50% had at least one comorbidity, which is higher than in background populations. The GTS\u00a0+\u00a0OCD-phenotype was significantly more frequent among GTS-concordant than among discordant twins. No statistically significant differences were found between the GTS-concordant and discordant twin pairs regarding tic severity or comorbidities. Thorough clinical assessment and SNP-based genotyping are important when conducting clinical twin studies. We found high concordance of GTS and CTD, which supports the notion that both disorders have common genetic risk factors. Further studies with larger cohorts including dizygotic twins are warranted for more conclusive results.",

    "abstract": "The management of multiple pregnancies is still a challenge. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of triplet pregnancies managed expectantly or by multifetal pregnancy reduction to twins.\nFor this retrospective, comparative and monocentric study, the medical files of all women with triplets who admitted to our institution over a 13-year period were examined. Women requesting multifetal pregnancy reduction to have twins formed the study group, and women with triplets who wished to continue their pregnancies formed the control group. Main outcome measures were durations of pregnancies presented as number of weeks gestation, abortion rates, term and preterm birth rates, fetal loss and live birth rates.\nDuring the study period, 171 women with triplets admitted to our institution. One hundred fifty one patients are included in this study. Forty-five women carrying triplets wished to continue their pregnancies and 106 women requested multifetal pregnancy reduction to have twins. Fetal reduction of triplets to twins was associated with a significantly lower incidence of birth before 34th gestational week and higher incidence of late preterm and term birth rates without changing live birth rates.\nMultifetal pregnancy reduction of triplet pregnancies to twins resulted in a later gestational age at birth compared with the triplet gestations managed expectantly.",

In this case, a 26-year-old woman with previously undiagnosed uterus didelphus spontaneously conceived dicavitary twins. Although initially wanting a vaginal birth, when both twins were in a breech presentation, a caesarean section was performed at 36 weeks, delivering two healthy babies.

    "abstract": "Although the perinatal mortality of monochorionic twins has been reported to be higher, the role of chorionicity is debated and data from Finland are still lacking. To examine the effect of chorionicity on the main outcome measures, perinatal and neonatal mortality and neonatal morbidity of Finnish twins, a comprehensive population-based historical cohort study was performed at Helsinki University Hospitals.\nAll 1034 dichorionic and monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies managed at Helsinki University Hospital area during 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 were collected from patient databases. Information on chorionicity was retrieved from ultrasound reports and all relevant clinical information from patient records. Differences in perinatal and neonatal mortality and neonatal morbidity were analyzed by performing group comparisons between the twins and chorionicity. The role of chorionicity was also assessed in logistic regression analyses.\nThere were 1034 dichorionic-diamniotic (DCDA, n\u00a0=\u00a0789, 76.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 73.6-78.9) and monochorionic-diamniotic (MCDA, n\u00a0=\u00a0245, 23.7%, 95% CI 21.4-26.0) twin pregnancies during the studied years. Most (n\u00a0=\u00a0580, 56.1%, 95% CI 52.8-59.2) twins were born at term, but 151 (61.6%, 95% CI 55.8-67.3) of MCDA twins were preterm and had lower birthweight and Apgar scores and higher risk of death of one twin. Perinatal and neonatal mortality did not differ between twins A and B, but the immediate outcome of twin B was worse, with lower arterial pH and Apgar scores and increased need of neonatal intensive care unit treatment.\nChorionicity contributes to the perinatal and neonatal outcome in favor of dichorionic twins. This disadvantage of MCDA twinning is likely explained by earlier gestational age at birth and inequal placental sharing. Irrespective of chorionicity, twin B faces more complications.",

Most (n\u00a0=\u00a0580, 56.1%, 95% CI 52.8-59.2) twins were born at term, but 151 (61.6%, 95% CI 55.8-67.3) of MCDA twins were preterm and had lower birthweight and Apgar scores and higher risk of death of one twin. Perinatal and neonatal mortality did not differ between twins A and B, but the immediate outcome of twin B was worse, with lower arterial pH and Apgar scores and increased need of neonatal intensive care unit treatment.",

    "abstract": "More than 30 genes are known to take part in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis development at the date and role of more than 10 other genes is studied. Despite it about 50% of isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism cases still have no molecular genetic explanation.A number of specific associations between iHH and different not-reproductive manifestations called syndromic forms are distinguished in general group of iHH. For example, the combination of Kalmann syndrome with sensorineural hearing loss is known as manifestation for defects of some genes encoding factors of neuronal migration; in patients with this phenotype CHD7, SOX10 genes defects are most frequent. However, defects in the genes of neuronal migration factors are characterized by a wide variability of phenotype, which is explained by the epigenetic mechanisms influence. Carriers of the mutation within the same family may lack some non-reproductive manifestations as well as hypogonadism.Here we present a case of Kalmann syndrome in monozygous twins, caused by a previously not described heterozygous mutation c.462C&gt; G: p.I154M in the SOX10 gene in the absence of sensorineural hearing loss. The mutation was inherited from a father who has only isolated anosmia in the phenotype. This mutation was identified during full exome sequencing. This unique observation for Russia shows on the one hand expediency to check SOX10 sequence in addition to the other factors of neuronal migration and differentiation and, on the other hand, the prospect of full exome sequencing in a group of patients with undifferentiated iHH.\n\u041d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c

    "abstract": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a complex disease of unknown aetiology in which inflammation and fibrosis lead to multiple organ damage. There is currently no effective therapy that can halt the progression of fibrosis or reverse it, thus studies that provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis and identify novel potential therapeutic targets are critically needed.\nWe used global gene expression and genome-wide DNA methylation analyses of dermal fibroblasts (dFBs) from a unique cohort of twins discordant for SSc to identify molecular features of this pathology. We validated the findings using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models.\nOur results revealed distinct differentially expressed and methylated genes, including several transcription factors involved in stem cell differentiation and developmental programmes (\nOur data support a role for epigenetic dysregulation in mediating SSc susceptibility in dFBs, illustrating the intricate interplay between CpG methylation, miRNAs and transcription factors in SSc pathogenesis, and highlighting the potential for future use of epigenetic modifiers as therapies.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and genetic findings of 53-year-old monozygotic twins who had bilateral otosclerosis and right-sided superior semicircular canal near dehiscence (SSCND). Monozygotic twins at the age of 53 presented with conductive hearing loss and normal tympanic membranes. Detailed audiovestibular testing and computed tomography scan revealed that both patients had concurrent otosclerosis and SSCND. Conservative management (hearing aids) was the treatment for these patients. Exome sequencing (ES) for the twins and their affected mother identified a heterozygous missense variant in the EYA4 (c.1744G>A; p.Glu582Lys) gene. This is the first case report to present these separate entities identified in monozygotic twins with a heterozygous missense variant in the EYA4 gene. Our ES data may imply a possible causal relationship or association between variants in the EYA4 gene and concurrent otosclerosis and SSCND.",

    "abstract": "Sporadic pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B (sporPHP1B) is an imprinting disease without a defined genetic cause, characterized by broad methylation changes in differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of the GNAS gene.\nThis work aims to provide insights into the causative event leading to the GNAS methylation defects through comprehensive molecular genetic analyses of a pair of female monozygotic twins concordant for sporPHP1B who were conceived naturally, that is, without assisted reproductive techniques.\nUsing the leukocyte genome of the twins and family members, we performed targeted bisulfite sequencing, methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme (MSRE)-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, and Sanger sequencing.\nMethylation analyses by targeted bisulfite sequencing and MSRE-qPCR revealed almost complete losses of methylation at the GNAS AS, XL, and A/B DMRs and a gain of methylation at the NESP55 DMR in the twins, but not in other family members. Except for the GNAS locus, we did not find apparent methylation defects at other imprinted genome loci of the twins. WGS, SNP array, and Sanger sequencing did not detect the previously described genetic defects associated with familial PHP1B. Sanger sequencing also ruled out any novel genetic alterations in the entire NESP55/AS region. However, the analysis of 28 consecutive SNPs could not exclude the possibility of paternal heterodisomy in a span of 22 kb comprising exon NESP55 and AS exon 5.\nOur comprehensive analysis of a pair of monozygotic twins with sporPHP1B ruled out all previously described genetic causes. Twin concordance indicates that the causative event was an imprinting error earlier than the timing of monozygotic twinning.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to variations in dental dimensions in a sample of Turkish twins, and to estimate heritability using dental casts.\nThe study samples were selected from the twin children between 3-15 years old who referred for their first dental examination. Fifty nine monozygotic and one hundred and forty three dizygotic twin pairs were examined in the study. The alginate impression material used to create the plaster model of maxilla and mandible. Anterior arch width, posterior arch width, arch length and arch circumference were measured on models prepared from measurements taken for both maxilla and mandible with digital caliper. The similarities and differences of the measurements were compared between pairs of twins and zygocytes. Morever, the effects of bad oral habits, bruxism, a result of psychosocial factors on measurements were examined. Statistical analysis was performed using Paired T Test, Wilcoxon Test and Mann Whitney U test.\nA total of 404 dental models of 118 (29.2%) monozygotic and 286 (70.8%) dizygotic twins were evaluated. There was no statistical difference between sibling pairs in both monozygotic and dizygotic twins. The measurement similarity between twin siblings differed according to zygosity in all measurements (p<0.05). It has been observed that the finger sucking and mouth breathing affect the dental arch measurements (p<0.05).\nThese results indicate that the differences in dental arch dimensions between monozygotic twin pairs are less than the difference between dizygotic twin pairs.",

Thoracopagus are the twins attached by chest and umbilicus and are the commonest among all the varieties but carries a poor survival rate. We describe our approach and experience of management of thoracopagus twins who were separated at eighty-three day of life and are alive and well after 4 years of follow up. The most important decisive parameter for successful separation is the extent of sharing of organs between twins but the role of a motivated multidisciplinary team is also indispensable.",

    "abstract": "Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) plays a key role in diabetes development and prognosis through its role in pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction and death as well as in upregulating the inflammatory response in hyperglycemia. DNA methylation (DNAm) of TXNIP (TXNIP-cg19693031) is associated with the prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, its role in inflammation and its relationship with T2D remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the epigenetic associations of TXNIP-cg19693031 with a panel of inflammatory biomarkers and to examine whether these inflammatory biomarkers modify the association between TXNIP-cg19693031 methylation and diabetes in 218 middle-aged male twins from the Emory Twin Study. We confirmed the association of TXNIP-cg19693031 DNAm with T2D, as well as with HbA1c, insulin and fasting glucose. We found that hypomethylation at TXNIP-cg19693031 is strongly associated with both type 2 diabetes and higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, MMP-2, sRAGE and P-selectin); however, the relationship between TXNIP-cg19693031 and T2D is independent of the levels of these inflammatory biomarkers. Our results suggest that DNA methylation of TXNIP is linked with multiple biological processes, through which the TXNIP may have broad influence on chronic disease risk.",

    "abstract": "Symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (sPDA) is common among preterm infants, and can lead to several complications. This is particularly true for extremely preterm infants, as closure of the ductus arteriosus using cyclooxygenase inhibitors is often difficult. A recent study using a preterm sheep model showed that intimal thickening-required for anatomical closure of the ductus arteriosus-is less developed in twins than in singletons. Therefore, this study primarily aimed to prove that the ductus arteriosus of extremely preterm twins is more resistant to cyclooxygenase inhibitors than those of extremely preterm singletons. Its secondary aim was to assess whether the resistance against cyclooxygenase inhibitors differed according to chorionicity. In this retrospective case-control study, medical records of 162 extremely preterm infants (gestational age\u2009<\u200928\u00a0weeks) were reviewed, and the treatment course of sPDA was subsequently compared between singletons (n\u2009=\u2009131) and twins (n\u2009=\u200931). The median indomethacin doses for sPDA and the necessity for surgical ligation were significantly higher in twins than in singletons (5 vs 2 [p\u2009<\u20090.001] and 42% vs 21% [p\u2009=\u20090.018], respectively). No significant differences in sPDA treatment, including the number of indomethacin doses and the necessity for surgical ligation, were observed between monochorionic diamniotic and dichorionic diamniotic twins. This study confirms that the ductus arteriosus of extremely preterm twins is more resistant to cyclooxygenase inhibitors than those of singletons. However, there was no significant difference in sPDA treatment by chorionicity.",

    "abstract": "A 56-year-old woman presented with an extensive sarcoma requiring nearly total back resection. She had limited donor sites for reconstruction because of a previous laparotomy, but presented with a significantly larger, identical twin. Cancer has traditionally been considered a contraindication for vascularized composite allotransplantation; however, immunosuppression is potentially avoidable between monozygotic twins.\nA preoperative genetic workup revealed 10/10 human leukocyte antigen homozygosity. Despite substantial phenotypic divergence in size and facial features, the sisters were genotypically identical. A two-stage, double deep inferior epigastric perforator transplant was planned for delayed reconstruction. At the first stage following the resection, an arteriovenous loop was performed to provide recipient vasculature to the back. At a second stage, the transplantation was performed. In addition, bilateral lumbar artery perforator flaps were created to reduce the length of the defect. Intraoperative steroid bolus and a short taper alone were used for immunosuppression.\nThe resection resulted in a 22 \u00d7 29-cm specimen down to the spine. After a 4-day interval for permanent pathologic evaluation, the transplant was successfully transferred between twins. Two arteries and six veins were anastomosed to establish perfusion. Postoperatively, there have been no episodes of rejection or flap compromise at last follow-up (>36 months).\nThis case represents one of the few vascularized composite allotransplantations between monozygotic twins, and the only reported successful vascularized composite allotransplantation for a recurrent cancer diagnosis. Oncologic safety depended on 100 percent histocompatibility to avoid immunosuppression. Limited patient donor sites precluded total autologous coverage, and a substantial size discrepancy between the twins favored a transplant.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now spread throughout the globe infecting over 150 million people and causing the death of over 3.2 million people. Thus, there is an urgent need to study the dynamics of epidemiological models to gain a better understanding of how such diseases spread. While epidemiological models can be computationally expensive, recent advances in machine learning techniques have given rise to neural networks with the ability to learn and predict complex dynamics at reduced computational costs. Here we introduce two digital twins of a SEIRS model applied to an idealised town. The SEIRS model has been modified to take account of spatial variation and, where possible, the model parameters are based on official virus spreading data from the UK. We compare predictions from one digital twin based on a data-corrected Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network with predictions from another digital twin based on a predictive Generative Adversarial Network. The predictions given by these two frameworks are accurate when compared to the original SEIRS model data. Additionally, these frameworks are data-agnostic and could be applied to towns, idealised or real, in the UK or in other countries. Also, more compartments could be included in the SEIRS model, in order to study more realistic epidemiological behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Infertility treatments have allowed millions of couples to have their own children, but resultant multiple pregnancies with their increased morbidity and mortality have been a significant complication. Fetal reduction was developed to ameliorate this issue. Over 30 years of publications show that fetal reduction has been highly successful in substantially reducing both mortality and morbidity related to multiple pregnancies. As with most radically new techniques, initial cases were in the \"nothing to lose\" category. With experience, indications liberalize, and quality of life issues gain relevance. The overall risks of twin pregnancy are not twice that of singleton pregnancy; they are about 4 to 5 times higher. In experienced hands, the combination of genetic testing by chorionic villus sampling followed by fetal reduction has made the outcomes of most multiple pregnancies statistically equivalent to those of pregnancies with lower fetal numbers. Use of microarray analysis to better determine fetal genetic health before deciding on which fetus(es) to keep or reduce further improves pediatric outcomes. With increasing experience and lower average starting numbers, the proportion of fetal reductions to a singleton has increased considerably. Twins to a singleton fetal reductions now constitute an increasing proportion of cases performed. Data on such cases show improved outcomes, and we believe fetal reduction should be at least discussed and offered to all patients with a dichorionic twin pregnancy or higher. With the increasing reliance on elective single-embryo transfers, monochorionic twins, which have much higher complication rates than dichorionic twins, have increased substantially. Furthermore, monochorionic twins cannot be readily and safely reduced, so the adverse perinatal statistics of elective single-embryo transfer are a major setback for good outcomes. Although elective single-embryo transfer is appropriate for some, we believe that for many couples, the transfer of 2 embryos is generally a more rational approach.",

    "abstract": "Industry 4.0 applications help digital industrial transformation to be achieved through smart, data-driven solutions that improve production efficiency, product consistency, preventive maintenance, and the logistics of industrial applications and related supply chains. To enable and accelerate digital industrial transformation, it is vital to support cost-efficient Industry 4.0 application development. However, the development of such Industry 4.0 applications is currently expensive due to the limitations of existing IoT platforms in representing complex industrial machines, the support of only production line-based application testing, and the lack of cost models for application cost/benefit analysis. In this paper, we propose the use of Cyber Twins (CTs), an extension of Digital Twins, to support cost-efficient Industry 4.0 application development. CTs provide semantic descriptions of the machines they represent and incorporate machine simulators that enable application testing without any production line risk and cost. This paper focuses on CT-based Industry 4.0 application development and the related cost models. Via a case study of a CT-based Industry 4.0 application from the dairy industry, the paper shows that CT-based Industry 4.0 applications can be developed with approximately 60% of the cost of IoT platform-based application development.",

    "abstract": "In the search for increased productivity and efficiency in the industrial sector, a new industrial revolution, called Industry 4.0, was promoted. In the electric sector, power plants seek to adapt these new concepts to optimize electric power generation processes, as well as to reduce operating costs and unscheduled downtime intervals. In these plants, PID control strategies are commonly used in water cooling systems, which use fans to perform the thermal exchange between water and the ambient air. However, as the nonlinearities of these systems affect the performance of the drivers, sometimes a greater number of fans than necessary are activated to ensure water temperature control which, consequently, increases energy expenditure. In this work, our objective is to develop digital twins for a water cooling system with auxiliary equipment, in terms of the decision making of the operator, to determine the correct number of fans. This model was developed based on the algorithm of automatic extraction of fuzzy rules, derived from the SCADA of a power plant located in the capital of Para\u00edba, Brazil. The digital twins can update the fuzzy rules in the case of new events, such as steady-state operation, starting and stopping ramps, and instability. The results from experimental tests using data from 11 h of plant operations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed digital twin model. Furthermore, in all scenarios, the average percentage error was less than 5% and the average absolute temperature error was below 3 \u00b0C.",

    "abstract": "Although vitamin D is related to cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength, there is no evidence in the literature about the genetic influence of the response to vitamin D supplementation and improvements in these parameters. Therefore, we evaluate the effect of longitudinal supplementation of vitamin D on parameters of physical fitness in monozygotic twins. In total, 74 participants were included, with a mean age of 25\u00a0years, divided into two groups, one group received supplementation with cholecalciferol for 60\u00a0days and the other group did not. Cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength were measured before and after supplementation through maximal treadmill tests and dynamometry, respectively. Wilcoxon tests were used to compare intragroup results and the Mann-Whitney test to examine intergroup differences. There was an increase in the serum concentration of vitamin D in participants who ingested the supplementation. Cardiorespiratory fitness improved after supplementation through increases in the values of maximum oxygen consumption of 28% (p < .001). Muscle strength in left hand grip increased 18% in participants who received the supplement (p = .007). Sixty days of cholecalciferol supplementation improved cardiorespiratory fitness and upper limb muscle strength.",

    "abstract": "Tic spectrum disorder (TSD) is an umbrella term which includes Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) and chronic tic disorder (CTD). They are considered highly heritable, yet the genetic components remain largely unknown. In this study we aimed to investigate disease-associated DNA methylation differences to identify genes and pathways which may be implicated in TSD aetiology. For this purpose, we performed an exploratory analysis of the genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in whole blood samples of 16 monozygotic twin pairs, of which eight were discordant and six concordant for TSD, while two pairs were asymptomatic. Although no sites reached genome-wide significance, we identified several sites and regions with a suggestive significance, which were located within or in the vicinity of genes with biological functions associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. The two top genes identified (",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all our lives, not only through the infection itself, but also through the measures taken to control the virus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spread (e.g., lockdown). Here we investigated how the COVID-19 pandemic and unprecedented lockdown affected the mental health of young adults in England and Wales. We compared the mental health symptoms of up to 4,000 twins in their mid-twenties in 2018 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (T1) to those in a four-wave longitudinal data collection during the pandemic in April, July, and October 2020, and in March 2021 (T2-T5). The average changes in mental health were small-to-medium and mainly occurred from 2018 (T1) to March 2020 (T2, one month following the start of lockdown; average Cohen d=0.14). Despite the expectation of catastrophic effects on the pandemic on mental health of our young adults, we did not observe trends in worsening mental health during the pandemic (T3-T5). Young people with pre-existing mental health problems were adversely affected at the beginning of the pandemic, but their increased problems largely subsided as the pandemic persisted. Twin analyses indicated that the aetiology of individual differences did not change during the lockdown. The average heritability of mental health symptoms was 33% across 5 waves of assessment, and the average genetic correlation between T1 and T2-T5 was .95, indicating that genetic effects before the pandemic (T1) are substantially correlated with genetic effects up to a year later (T2-T5). We conclude that on average the mental health of young adults in England and Wales has been remarkably resilient to the effects of the pandemic and associated lockdown.",

    "abstract": "Digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have grown rapidly in recent years and are considered by both academia and industry to be key enablers for Industry 4.0. As a digital replica of a physical entity, the basis of DT is the infrastructure and data, the core is the algorithm and model, and the application is the software and service. The grounding of DT and AI in industrial sectors is even more dependent on the systematic and in-depth integration of domain-specific expertise. This survey comprehensively reviews over 300 manuscripts on AI-driven DT technologies of Industry 4.0 used over the past five years and summarizes their general developments and the current state of AI-integration in the fields of smart manufacturing and advanced robotics. These cover conventional sophisticated metal machining and industrial automation as well as emerging techniques, such as 3D printing and human-robot interaction/cooperation. Furthermore, advantages of AI-driven DTs in the context of sustainable development are elaborated. Practical challenges and development prospects of AI-driven DTs are discussed with a respective focus on different levels. A route for AI-integration in multiscale/fidelity DTs with multiscale/fidelity data sources in Industry 4.0 is outlined.",

    "abstract": "Aiming at the problem of the poor plasticity of magnesium alloy leading to serious edge cracks in the rolling process, this paper conducts a systematic study on the crack suppression mechanism of rolling under different thickness reductions. Using restricted rolling and conventional rolling, comparing the microstructure evolution of the plate after rolling, and combining the information of the simulated temperature field and stress field of the plates, the behavior of twins and dislocations under different thickness reductions is explained, and the influence of serious damage caused by single-pass hot rolling of magnesium alloy is explored. The compressive stress fields along with the transverse and normal directions under restricted rolling cause the compression twins to mature into secondary twins under rolling with small thickness reduction and induce a large number of tensile twins when the thickness reduction amount is increased. The multiple slips activated by the higher temperature field at the edge of the small thickness reduction amount cause dislocations to be distributed inside and outside the twins, while the edge with large thickness reduction can activate more slip due to the high-temperature field resulting from friction, resulting in the twin be destroyed.",

No method of aneuploidy screening is as accurate in twin pregnancies as singleton pregnancies. Cell-free DNA screening should be considered a first-line approach; however, this option may not be available or may have limitations in certain clinical scenarios, such as vanishing twins. If cell-free DNA screening is not available, nuchal translucency and/or maternal serum marker screening can be offered.",

    "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been related to accelerated biological aging processes, but objective evidence for this association is limited. DNA methylation (DNAm) age acceleration is a novel measure of biological aging that may help clarify if PTSD is related to biological aging processes. We aim to examine whether PTSD is associated with biological aging using a comprehensive set of DNAm age acceleration markers and to what extent the unshared environment contributes to the association.\nUsing a cross-sectional co-twin control study design, we investigated the association of the clinical diagnosis and symptom severity of PTSD with six measurements of DNAm age acceleration based on epigenome-wide data derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 296 male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry.\nTwins with current PTSD had significantly advanced DNAm age acceleration compared with twins without PTSD for five of six measures of DNAm age acceleration. Across almost all measures of DNAm age acceleration, twins with current PTSD were \"epigenetically older\" than their twin brothers without PTSD: estimated differences ranged between 1.6 (95% confidence interval = 0.0-3.1) and 2.7 (95% confidence interval = 0.5-4.8) biological age year-equivalents. A higher Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale score was also associated with a higher within-pair DNAm age acceleration. Results remained consistent after adjustment for behavioral and cardiovascular risk factors.\nPTSD is associated with epigenetic age acceleration, primarily through unshared environmental mechanisms as opposed to genetic or familial factors. These results suggest that PTSD is related to systemic processes relevant to biological aging.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare and serious complication of monochorionic twins. The total incidence is 1.5 per 100,000 births, and about 50% are liveborn. Prenatal screening and diagnosis of conjoined twins is usually performed by ultrasonography. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assist in the diagnosis if necessary. Conjoined twins in dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy are extremely rare.\nWe reported three cases of dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy with conjoined twins. Due to the poor prognosis of conjoined twins evaluated by multidisciplinary teams, selective termination of conjoined twins was performed in three cases. In case 1, selective reduction of the conjoined twins was performed at 16 gestational weeks, and a healthy female baby weighing 3270\u2009g was delivered at 37\u2009weeks. In case 2, the conjoined twins were selectively terminated at 17\u2009weeks of gestation, and a healthy female baby weighing 2760\u2009g was delivered at 37\u2009weeks and 4\u2009days. In case 3, the conjoined twins were selectively terminated at 15\u2009weeks and 2\u2009days, and a healthy female baby weighing 2450\u2009g was delivered at 33\u2009weeks and 6\u2009days. The babies of all three cases were followed up and are in good health.\nSurgical separation is the only treatment for conjoined twins after birth. Early determination of chorionicity and antenatal diagnosis of conjoined twins in triplet gestations are critical for individualized management options and the prognosis of normal triplets. Expecting parents should be extensively counseled by multidisciplinary teams. If there are limitations in successful separation after birth, early selective termination of the conjoined twins by intrathoracic injection of potassium chloride may be a procedure in dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy to improve perinatal outcomes of the normal triplet.",

    "abstract": "A 3-month-old first of dizygotic male twins, born at 34\u00a0+ 5 weeks gestational age, presented with a 4-week history of increasing head circumference and vomiting. He had a tense anterior fontanelle and a head circumference above the 97th percentile. Magnetic resonance imaging showed large bilateral subdural collection with hemosiderin deposits suggestive of hemorrhage. Nine days of bilateral subdural drainage reduced the collection size and blood load. On postoperative day 16, magnetic resonance imaging confirmed persistent but smaller subdural collections, unmasking the underlying subarachnoid space enlargement. On day 18, a right subdural-peritoneal valveless shunt was inserted as definitive treatment. As part of a nonaccidental injury investigation, Twin 2 was also found to have macrocephaly secondary to benign enlargement of subarachnoid space, which was managed conservatively. Benign enlargement of subarachnoid space has an assumed autosomal/multifactorial inheritance and predisposes to subdural hemorrhage. Ultimately, no safeguarding issues were raised. Both twins continued to be neurologically stable at 2-year follow-up with head circumferences between the 98th and 99th percentiles.",

    "abstract": "Klinefelter syndrome and monozygotic twins are both rare. The reports of monozygotic twins with Klinefelter syndrome to have undergone fertility treatment are uncommon. This case report describes a case of 30-year-old monozygotic adult twin brothers diagnosed with nonmosaic Klinefelter syndrome following the complaint of infertility. The result of semen analysis showed cryptozoospermia (very low sperm count) and azoospermia (zero sperm count) with physical findings and lifestyles being very similar. They both underwent microtesticular sperm extraction. One had successful sperm retrieval and achieved pregnancy through intracytoplasmic sperm injection, whereas the other did not. Testicular pathological findings showed Sertoli cell-only syndrome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on monozygotic adult twins both of whom underwent microtesticular sperm extraction and resulted in different outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Identifying risk factors associated with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is essential for early diagnosis and treatment. Breech presentation is a major DDH risk factor, possibly because of crowding of the fetus within the uterus. In multifetal pregnancy, fetuses are generally smaller than singletons, which may obscure the effect of breech presentation on fetal hips. Only a few studies have investigated the occurrence of DDH in multifetal pregnancies. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether the breech presentation is a major risk factor of DDH in twin pregnancies.\nThis retrospective study included 491 consecutive live births (after 23+0 weeks gestation) delivered through cesarean section with at least 1 baby with noncephalic presentation in single or twin pregnancies from April 2013 to October 2018. We analyzed the incidence of DDH and its associated factors, including sex, breech, and multifetal pregnancy, with a generalized linear mixed model.\nThe incidence of DDH was 12.5% in singleton with breech presentation, 9.8% in twin-breech presentation, and 0.7% in twin-cephalic presentation. Multivariate analysis showed that singleton-breech presentation (P=0.003), twin-breech presentation (P=0.003), and female sex (P=0.008) were independent risk factors for DDH.\nBreech presentation is an independent risk factor for DDH in twin pregnancies, although twin pregnancy itself is not an independent risk factor for DDH.",

    "abstract": "To compare maternal and neonatal outcomes after preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) from 23 to 34 weeks of gestation in twin compared with singleton gestations.\nWe conducted a secondary analysis of an obstetric cohort of 115,502 individuals and their singleton or twin neonates born in 25 hospitals nationwide (2008-2011). Those with preterm PROM from 23 0/7 through 33 6/7 weeks of gestation were included; neonates with major fetal anomalies were excluded. The coprimary outcomes for this analysis were composite maternal morbidity (chorioamnionitis, blood transfusion, postpartum endometritis, wound infection, sepsis, venous thromboembolism, intensive care unit admission, or death) and composite major neonatal morbidity (persistent pulmonary hypertension, intraventricular hemorrhage grade III or IV, seizures, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, necrotizing enterocolitis stage II or III, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, stillbirth subsequent to admission, or neonatal death before discharge). Logistic regression was used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for twin compared with singleton gestations.\nOf 1,531 (1.3%) individuals who met eligibility criteria for this analysis, 218 (14.2%) had twin gestations. The median gestational age at preterm PROM was similar between those with twins and singletons (31.2 weeks [interquartile range 27.4-32.9] vs 30.6 weeks [interquartile range 26.9-32.7], P=.23); however, those with twin gestations had a shorter median latency period (2.0 days [interquartile range 1.0-5.0] vs 3.0 days [interquartile range 2.0-8.0], P<.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, odds of experiencing composite maternal morbidity (17.9% vs 19.3%, adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66-1.42) or composite neonatal morbidity (20.4% vs 20.5%, OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72-1.31) did not differ between groups.\nIn a large, diverse cohort, the likelihood of composite maternal or neonatal morbidity per fetus after preterm PROM was similar for twin and singleton gestations.",

The data were analysed from facial 3D images and manually added landmarks. 3D images were analysed by Rapidform2006 software and statistical analyses were done by using the R software environment version 4.1.0.\nThe contralateral effect of PCS and larger chin side was dominant among right and non-right side chewing twins. Being female increased the whole face symmetry.\nThe volume of the chin becomes larger on the side opposite to the twins' habitual chewing side.

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a mental illness that involves both genetic and environmental factors. Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is a well-established therapy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. In this study, we focused on a set of monozygotic twins with treatment-resistant schizophrenia in which one twin effectively responded to clozapine treatment and the other did not. Our previous study generated neurons from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from these patients and compared the transcriptome profiles between mock- and clozapine-treated neurons. In this study, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling to investigate the mechanisms underlying gene expression changes. First, we extracted the differentially methylated sites from each twin based on statistical analysis. Then, we combined the DNA methylation profiling with transcriptome profiling from our previous RNA-seq data. Among the genes with altered methylation and expression, we found the different proportions of the genes related to neuronal and synaptic functions between the clozapine responder and non-responder (35.7 and 6.7%, respectively). This trend was observed even when the basal differences between the responder and non-responder was excluded. These results suggest that effective clozapine action may correct the abnormalities of neuronal and synapse functions in schizophrenia via changes in methylation.",

    "abstract": "The velopharyngeal mechanism is comprised of several muscular components that act in a coordinated manner to control airflow through the nose and mouth. Proper velopharyngeal function is essential for normal speech, swallowing, and breathing. The genetic basis of normal-range velopharyngeal morphology is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to estimate the heritability of velopharyngeal dimensions. We measured five velopharyngeal variables (velar length, velar thickness, effective velar length, levator muscle length and pharyngeal depth) from MRIs of 155 monozygotic and 208 dizygotic twin pairs and then calculated heritability for these traits using a structural equation modeling approach. The heritability estimates were statistically significant (95% confidence intervals excluded zero) and ranged from 0.19 to 0.46. There was also evidence of significant genetic correlations between pairs of traits, pointing to the influence of common genetic effects. These results indicate that genetic factors influence variation in clinically relevant velopharyngeal structures.",

    "abstract": "Olmsted syndrome is a rare and complex skin disorder affecting 46 (published) infants as of 2012. The infants affected in this case were born premature at 28 weeks' gestation. Infants affected by this syndrome demonstrate numerous plaques on several specific areas of the skin. Common treatments include exfoliation in addition to psoriasis treatments. The extremely fragile nature of the premature infants' skin complicates treatment modalities.\nThe progression of the infants' dermatologic findings and plaque formation is discussed in this case study.\nThe primary diagnosis of Olmsted syndrome was made with the assistance of a multidisciplinary team to work through several differential diagnoses presenting with severe forms of palmoplantar keratoderma.\nThe management of skin plaques in twin premature infants is presented in this case study. An evidence-based approach, utilizing the model of family-centered care, is presented with multidisciplinary involvement and an outline of the specific plan of care for the extensive skin care regimen used.\nAn interdisciplinary skin care regimen was created to provide consistency in transition from hospital to home. Using a consistent approach, the plaques were able to be softened and many removed. Continual maintenance is required to manage continual buildup of skin plaques.\nPremature infants are at increased risk for infection due to the immaturity of their skin. The complexity of their skin complicates the ability to recognize and care for rare skin disorders. This case study illuminates the practicality of a consistent and evidence-based approach to a complex and rare skin disorder.",

    "abstract": "Blood pressure (BP) is an independent and important factor for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.\nWe firstly conducted twin modeling analyses to explore the heritability of BP, including systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), and then performed genome-wide association studies to explore the associated genomic loci, genes, and pathways.\nA total of 380 Chinese twin pairs were included. The AE model containing additive genetic parameter (A) and unique/non-shared environmental parameter (E) was the best fit model, with A accounting for 53.7%, 50.1%, 48.1%, and 53.3% for SBP, DBP, PP and MAP, respectively. No SNP was found to reach the genome-wide significance level (p\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\nOur study suggests that BP is moderately heritable in the Chinese population and could be mediated by a series of genomic loci, genes, and pathways. Future larger-scale studies are needed to confirm our findings.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins and higher-order multiples arise when a zygote splits during pre-implantation stages of development. The mechanisms underpinning this event have remained a mystery. Because MZ twinning rarely runs in families, the leading hypothesis is that it occurs at random. Here, we show that MZ twinning is strongly associated with a stable DNA methylation signature in adult somatic tissues. This signature spans regions near telomeres and centromeres, Polycomb-repressed regions and heterochromatin, genes involved in cell-adhesion, WNT signaling, cell fate, and putative human metastable epialleles. Our study also demonstrates a never-anticipated corollary: because identical twins keep a lifelong molecular signature, we can retrospectively diagnose if a person was conceived as monozygotic twin.",

    "abstract": "The acceleration of the epigenetic clock has been associated with a reduction in life expectancy. Individuals diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder have a reduction in life expectancy, and some studies have correlated it with accelerated aging.\nThe present study aims to explore whether the presence of any psychiatric disorder could accelerate the epigenetic clock in monozygotic twins.\nA total of 15 pairs of monozygotic twins were included. Epigenetic age in peripheral blood cells was estimated by previously published algorithms, using the 450K Beadchip microarray.\nWe found that in twins with a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, the epigenetic clock could increase compared to their twin without a psychiatric disorder.\nThe presence of some psychiatric disorder could accelerate the epigenetic clock in homozygous twins, but studies with larger samples are required to clarify this relationship.",

    "abstract": "The purposes are to explore the effect of Digital Twins (DTs) in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) on providing medical resources quickly and accurately during COVID-19 prevention and control. The feasibility of UAV DTs during COVID-19 prevention and control is analyzed. Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are introduced. A UAV DTs information forecasting model is constructed based on improved AlexNet, whose performance is analyzed through simulation experiments. As end-users and task proportion increase, the proposed model can provide smaller transmission delays, lesser energy consumption in throughput demand, shorter task completion time, and higher resource utilization rate under reduced transmission power than other state-of-art models. Regarding forecasting accuracy, the proposed model can provide smaller errors and better accuracy in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), bit quantizer, number of pilots, pilot pollution coefficient, and number of different antennas. Specifically, its forecasting accuracy reaches 95.58% and forecasting velocity stabilizes at about 35 Frames-Per-Second (FPS). Hence, the proposed model has stronger robustness, making more accurate forecasts while minimizing the data transmission errors. The research results can reference the precise input of medical resources for COVID-19 prevention and control.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to comprehensively assess fetal hemodynamic adaptions to occlusive procedures. Twin pregnancies complicated with acardiac twin and hydrops fetalis of the pump twin were recruited. The occlusive procedures - either alcoholization, radiofrequency ablation, coil embolization or occlusive glue - were performed under ultrasound guidance. Various hemodynamic parameters were assessed before, shortly after, then every 6 h for 48 h and 2-4 weeks after the procedures. Seven pregnancies were recruited. The median (range) gestational age of intervention was 21 (17-26) weeks of gestation. Before the procedures, all cases showed normal cardiac function. Just after the procedures, all cases showed an increase in Tei index and isovolumic relaxation time but returned to preocclusion levels within 6-48 h, except for two cases that were persistently high. Increased preload and poor shortening fraction were observed in two cases, leading to heart failure, with one recovery and one death in\u00a0utero. Five out of the seven cases got through the critical period with a gradual return to normal hemodynamics, ending with the disappearance of hydrops and successful outcomes. It was concluded that the occlusive procedure could aggravate the overworked heart, leading to heart failure. Preocclusion preload index and Tei index may predict risk of heart failure due to the occlusion. This small series strongly suggests that the occlusion should be performed before the deterioration of cardiac function.",

    "abstract": "Over the past year, there has been a rise in twin births. The current scientific consensus recommended breast-feed milk for all newborns for at least 6 months. They stated that it is possible to meet the nutritional needs of two or more newborns with only one mother's milk. More information would be desirable about the factors that influence or lead to the initiation and interruption of breastfeeding. The quality of the evidence available from multiple studies has been inconclusive and therefore led to controversial interpretations and practices.\nThe first aim of this study was to analyze the extent of the feeding of multiples with breast milk in the experience of our clinical unit in terms of incidence and duration. The second objective was to evaluate the correlation between maternal, perinatal and neonatal variables with breast milk feeding rates and duration.\nThe study was conducted between 2015 and 2020, in a NICU in Southern Italy (San Giovanni Rotondo, Foggia). Sixty-one women who have given birth to multiples were enrolled into the study. Newborn data were retrospectively collected by informatic database and breastfeeding information were collected by a questionnaire.\nIn our centre, the percentage of twins out of the total number of births over the years has almost doubled from 1.28% in 2015 to 2.48% in 2020 and the 88% of twins are premature. 18.1% received breast milk for more than 6 months and 6.3% received it for more than 12 months. Infants of lower gestational age and weight, born to multiparous, more mature and medium-high schooling mothers received breast milk for a longer period. 35% of women explained that the interruption of breastfeeding was due to the insufficient milk production and 41% to the stress and difficulties in managing the twins. Qualitative analysis of maternal narrative revealed, for many of them, the awareness of the importance of breastfeeding and the efforts made to try to give breast milk, but also fears about the quantity of milk and satiety of their children.\nIt is important to identify the factors both favoring and obstructing maternal milk feeding of multiples and it would be desirable the activation of a network of training and support for mothers after discharge, with particular regard to the categories found to be less inclined.",

    "abstract": "There is a lack of consensus about the management of twins with significant cervical length (CL) shortening, especially if CL is above 25\u2009mm. Therefore, it is important to define \"abnormal\" CL change over time, and to compare the performance of different strategies. The aim of this study was twofold, to describe the performance of the cervical shortening and that of an integrated strategy that includes both the cervical shortening and a fixed CL cutoff <25\u2009mm in any measurement as predictor of spontaneous PTB (sPTB) < 34\u2009weeks in uncomplicated twin pregnancies.\nRetrospective cohort study of twins followed in our Twins Clinic at Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires from 2013 to 2017. Inclusion criteria were dichorionic or monochorionic diamniotic twins with CL measurement between 18 and 33\u2009+\u20096\u2009weeks with available data of the delivery. Exclusion criteria included any of the following complications: iatrogenic preterm delivery <34\u2009weeks, cerclage, fetal growth restriction, fetal death, structural anomalies, polyhydramnios, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, selective fetal growth restriction, twin anemia-polycythemia sequence, and twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence. Spontaneous preterm birth was defined as spontaneous delivery <34\u2009weeks. Cervical shortening was analyzed in the following periods: 20-24\u2009weeks, 20-28\u2009weeks, 24-28\u2009weeks, 24-32\u2009weeks and 28-32\u2009weeks. Cervical changes were analyzed as \nWe included 378 patients and 1417 measurements, 284 (75%) dichorionic and 94 (25%) monochorionic. Between 20 and 28\u2009weeks, with a change in CL cutoff = 1.6\u2009mm/week or 4.1%/week the detection rate was 54.2% (32.8-74.4%) and the specificity 80.5% (75.1-85.1%) and 83.5% (78.5-87.8%) respectively. In the integrated strategy, the detection rate was 65.7% (47.8-80.9%) and the specificity 69 (63.7-74). All the ROC curves of the periods studied showed an AUC < 0.7. In the group of patients that delivered preterm the initial mean CL was shorter than in the term group, 39 (\u00b112) mm vs. 43 (\u00b1 7.7) mm (\nThe performance of all the strategies analyzed as a predictor of sPTB <34\u2009weeks was moderate. The period 20-28\u2009weeks detected half of the patients at risk with a FPR around 10-20% and the integrated strategy increased the sensitivity up to a detection of two thirds of the patients at risk but with a FPR of \u223c30%. Future analyses need to explore other strategies to improve the performance and to really identify the patients at higher risk.",

    "abstract": "To present a case of two identical twins presenting concurrently with symptoms and subsequent initial diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).\nClinical, laboratory and MRI findings for both twins were reviewed and presented here.\nTwin A presented with right eye pain and subsequent blurred vision in right eye. MRI of the brain and spine demonstrated pre-chiasmal right optic nerve enhancement and T2 hyperintense lesions in the spinal cord at T7 and T9 levels. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was remarkable for NMO/aquaporin-4 (AQP4) fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) titre of 1:32 and a serum NMO/AQP4-IgG positive titre of 1:10\u2009000. Twin B presented with diplopia. MRI of the brain and spine demonstrated T2 hyperintense lesions in the periventricular cerebral white matter, in the periaqueductal white matter of the pons, in the midbrain and the cervical spinal cord. Neurological examination findings revealed incomplete right trochlear palsy, rotatory nystagmus, an incomplete left internuclear ophthalmoplegia and hyper-reflexia. CSF analysis was remarkable for NMO/AQP4 FACS titre of 1:256 and a serum NMO-IgG positive titre of 1:10\u2009000. Both twins responded well to intravenous steroid therapy. There was no adverse environmental exposure present.\nWe present an interesting and rare case of identical twins presenting concurrently and for the first time with NMOSD.",

    "abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is considered a rare malignant head and neck tumour. However, the importance of genetics and environmental factors in the epidemiology of NPC is still unclear. Twins represent an excellent study population for genetic epidemiology; this is especially true of monozygotic-type twins because they are genetically identical. The difference in cancer occurrence between monozygotic twins is typically interpreted as a result of possible environmental factors.\nWe present the first case report of monozygotic twins with NPC. The twins' significant features are homogenous presentation, tumour location (both left-sided) and identical histology; therefore, the prognoses may be similar. Environmental factors could not be addressed in these twins because they shared the same background, and at the same time, they had no potential known contributing factors.\nHaving one of the twins affected is a strong and easily recognisable risk factor for developing NPC in the other. This strong association suggests the need for regular screening of the second twin for early diagnosis of NPC.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to compare the rate of preterm birth (PTB) and growth from birth to 18 years between twins conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) and twins conceived by spontaneous conception (SC) in mainland China. The retrospective cohort study included 1164 twins resulting from IVF and 25,654 twins conceived spontaneously, of which 494 from IVF and 6338 from SC were opposite-sex twins. PTB and low birth weight (LBW), and growth, including length/height and weight, were compared between the two groups at five stages: infancy (0 year), toddler period (1-2 years), preschool (3-5 years), primary or elementary school (6-11 years), and adolescence (10-18 years). Few statistically significant differences were found for LBW and growth between the two groups after adjusting for PTB and other confounders. Twins born by IVF faced an increased risk of PTB compared with those born by SC (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 8.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] [3.19, 21.13], p < .001 in all twins and aOR 10.12, 95% CI [2.32, 44.04], p = .002 in opposite-sex twins). Twins born by IVF experienced a similar growth at five stages (0-18 years old) when compared with those born by SC. PTB risk, however, is significantly higher for twins conceived by IVF than those conceived by SC.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart defects (CHDs) refer to abnormalities in the heart function that arise at the fetal stages. It is the most common birth defect that affects 0.8% of all liveborn infants. There is an increase in the incidence of congenital heart disease in monochorionic twin gestation. A six-fold increase in CHDs exists among monochorionic twins especially in association with twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) compared to dichorionic twin pregnancy. In this review article, we discussed the epidemiology, the role of genetics like protein-coding genes, epigenetics, placenta, hemodynamics and environmental factors in the etiology of CHD in twins. We conducted a literature search in PubMed indexed journals using the medical terms \"twin pregnancy\" and \"congenital heart defect\" to provide an overview of the uptrend in CHD in twin pregnancies, primarily due to assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) and\u00a0multiple other factors. Both the heart and placenta are vascular and share a common development window; therefore, CHD can develop secondary to placental pathologies. Among environmental factors, the strongest association of maternal smoking with CHD has been seen. We studied the causative factors to suggest\u00a0improvement in echocardiographic skills in case of abnormal findings in twin gestations to decrease the CHD-associated morbidity and mortality, as early diagnosis allows doctors to precisely determine the risk of CHD. Systemic ultrasound scanning with five transverse views is very effective in diagnosing fetal CHD in twin pregnancy. In the case of genetics, prenatal counseling allows\u00a0the expectant to understand the full ramifications of possible events after the pregnancy. The pathological basis of malformations specific to\u00a0conjoined twinning and twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence is addressed. Also, there is evidence that folate supplementation may be protective against CHD but more research is needed to clarify the mechanisms. We concluded from the literature that monochorionic twins are at high risk of CHD.\u00a0Chorionicity seems to play a more vital role than zygosity. Even the type of heart defect in monochorial twin pregnancies was unique from single, dizygotic, or dichorionic twin pregnancies. We also emphasize improving echocardiographic skills of technicians in referring ART dichorionic twin fetuses with suspicious findings to fetal cardiologists and performing postnatal scans in the case of TTTS. To understand the role of the placenta, making use of newer technologies and examining the placenta both during pregnancy and beyond delivery will play a vital role in understanding the etiology. Even identifying early signals impacting the heart and placental vasculature and correcting them using advanced technology could downtrend the incidence in coming years. Increased maternal age\u00a0as well as multiple pregnancies increasing the risk of CHD has also been implicated. For more clarity on the role of genetics, the cost of DNA sequencing needs to decrease. This will enable whole-genome sequencing in the future thus\u00a0helping to discover the gene responsible for CHD ultimately proving beneficial for future generations. For environmental factors, we have to rely on observational studies to assess the risk to the unborn child. There is difficulty in studying\u00a0natural factors due to the unreliability of exposure to contaminants like pesticides and air pollution.",

    "abstract": "Large cupping of the optic disk in a baby or a child can be indicative of primary congenital glaucoma. Primary congenital glaucoma is often refractory to treatment, and lifelong management and follow-up are necessary; therefore, diagnosis requires careful consideration. In this study, we describe the case of twins in whom primary congenital glaucoma was initially suspected due to large cupping of the optic disks. Twin babies\u00a0(a boy and a girl weighing\u00a0455 g and\u00a0592 g respectively), born prematurely (at 28 gestational weeks), were referred to our hospital eight months after birth because large cupping of the optic disks was detected during follow-up for retinopathy of prematurity. According to color fundus photographs, the cup/disk ratios in both eyes of both babies ranged from 0.75 to 0.86. However, the axial length ranged from 18.57 to 19.91\u00a0mm, the anterior chamber depth ranged from 2.68 to 2.93 mm, and the horizontal diameters of the corneas, which were clear, ranged from 10 to 10.5\u00a0mm. The intraocular pressures (IOPs), as measured by a rebound tonometer, were 15.3-19.7 mmHg. Glaucoma was strongly suspected due to the large cupping of the optics disks; however, other ocular biometric tests demonstrated that the eyes were normal. After eight months of follow-up without any medication or intervention, the IOPs stabilized between 6-22.1 mmHg, the refractive errors were between -2.5 and 0 diopters, and we found no apparent enlargement of the optic disks. In addition, we investigated both parents' optic disks to evaluate the genetic factors and found that they had relatively large C/D ratios (0.68-0.79). These premature twins exhibited glaucoma-like optic disks with large cupping, but no solid glaucomatous changes were observed with ocular biometry and IOP testing. We concluded, therefore, that the early birth and lower birth weights may have been associated with the large cupping of the patients' optic disks. To differentiate between normal physiological cupping and primary congenital glaucoma, ocular morphological examination of the eye, IOP measurements, and investigation of the parents' optic disks were useful.",

    "abstract": "Comparing twins from same- and opposite-sex pairs can provide information on potential sex differences in a variety of outcomes, including socioeconomic-related outcomes such as educational attainment. It has been suggested that this design can be applied to examine the putative role of intrauterine exposure to testosterone for educational attainment, but the evidence is still disputed. Thus, we established an international database of twin data from 11 countries with 88,290 individual dizygotic twins born over 100\u00a0years and tested for differences between twins from same- and opposite-sex dizygotic pairs in educational attainment. Effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by linear regression models after adjusting for birth year and twin study cohort. In contrast to the hypothesis, no difference was found in women (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.05 educational years, 95% CI -0.11, 0.02). However, men with a same-sex co-twin were slightly more educated than men having an opposite-sex co-twin (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.14 educational years, 95% CI 0.07, 0.21). No consistent differences in effect sizes were found between individual twin study cohorts representing Europe, the USA, and Australia or over the cohorts born during the 20th century, during which period the sex differences in education reversed favoring women in the latest birth cohorts. Further, no interaction was found with maternal or paternal education. Our results contradict the hypothesis that there would be differences in the intrauterine testosterone levels between same-sex and opposite-sex female twins affecting education. Our findings in men may point to social dynamics within same-sex twin pairs that may benefit men in their educational careers.",

    "abstract": "The multifactorial nature of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has led to increased efforts in establishing various risk factors. Well-known environmental risk factors for HNSCC include tobacco use, heavy alcohol consumption, immunosuppression, and more recently human papillomavirus infection. Familial clustering has been observed in cancers occurring at other sites, but not so much with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) without exposure to shared environmental risk factors. An unusual case of identical twins who presented with OSCC involving an identical site and exhibiting similar histological features is reported here. The two patients underwent identical surgery with curative intent, culminating in good outcomes. It appears that no other cases of identical twins with a similar presentation in time, anatomical site, and histopathology have been reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "To clarify the relationships between placental characteristics and birthweight discordance in three types of selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) in monochorionic diamniotic twins.\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted between april 2013 and april 2020.

Model A was adjusted for gestational age, Model B additionally adjusted for the impact of placental characteristics interacted.\nIn cases of type I sIUGR, birthweight discordance ratio was positively associated with placental territory discordance ratio [(\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.181,95%CI(0.072,0.290), p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.239,95%CI(0.125, 0.353), p\u00a0<\u00a00.05)] under both Model A and Model B.

    "abstract": "Our objective was to evaluate the perinatal outcome of selective termination of dichorionic twin pregnancies with discordant anomalies, according to gestational age at time of procedure.\nRetrospective review of 147 dichorionic twin pregnancies referred to our Fetal Medicine Unit between 2003 and 2018 for selective termination. Gestational age at delivery, fetal loss, and overall and 28-day post-delivery survival rates, were evaluated according to gestational age at time of procedure. Selective termination procedure was defined as early, intermediate, and late when performed before 18\u00a0weeks, between 18 and 23\u00a0weeks, and after 23\u00a0weeks, respectively. Kruskal-Wallis and chi-squared test were used to compare groups.\nOverall survival at 28\u00a0days post-delivery, pregnancy loss, and preterm delivery before 32\u00a0weeks of gestation rates were 93.4%, 6.9%, and 15.5%, respectively. When stratified by gestational age at procedure, intermediate selective termination was associated with a lower survival rate than early and late procedures (86% vs. 96.9% and 100%, respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.035), and a nonsignificant trend for higher pregnancy loss (12% vs. 3.1%). Preterm delivery before 32\u00a0weeks of gestation occurred in 27% of late procedures, which was significantly higher than in early (9.5%) and intermediate (18.2%) procedures.\nSelective termination in dichorionic twin pregnancies with discordant fetal anomaly is associated with low pregnancy loss and preterm delivery rate, primarily when performed before 18\u00a0weeks. When legally possible, late procedures can be a good alternative, particularly in those cases diagnosed beyond the 18th week of gestation.",

    "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases that have in common the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (mucopolysaccharides) within the lysosome. The diseases are caused by a deficiency of the enzyme \u03b1-L-iduronidase which is responsible for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs or mucopolysaccharides). More than 100 mutations in the gene have been reported, resulting in marked clinical/response variability. MPSs usually present as multisystem and progressive clinical disorders which affect psychomotor and cardiovascular development, the cornea and the musculoskeletal system. Seven phenotypically distinct diseases have been described, and MPS type I (MPS-I) is divided into three clinical forms: severe (Hurler syndrome), intermediate (Hurler-Scheie syndrome) or mild (Scheie syndrome). For the treatment of MPS-I, Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) with \u03b1-L-iduronidase and Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplantation (HSCT), separately or in combination, have produced clinical improvement, especially with regards cardiovascular symptoms and psychomotor development. This article presents the long-term (more than seven years) follow-up of monochorionic, diamniotic twins who were diagnosed with MPS-I at an early stage, and treated with ERT (from age 10 months) plus HSCT (from age 18 months). Overall, the treatment has facilitated stable development with an overall good response and better control of symptoms associated with MPS-I.",
