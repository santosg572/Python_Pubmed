    "abstract": "Being unique is good, but not so for conjoined twins. Cephalothoracopagus is a rare type of conjoined twins, which is a rare monozygotic twinning resulting in imperfect fusion of the head, chest and upper abdomen. These twins have separated limbs and pelvis. The incidence of conjoined twins is 1 per 50,000 to 1 per 200,000 births. The cephalothoracopagus however is very rare variant seen in 1 in 3 million births. In literature approximately 200 cases have been reported till now. The cephalothoracopagus janiceps has two types: disymmetros and asymmetros. We present a case of cephalothoracopagus janiceps disymmetros in a 22-year-old gravida at 19 weeks gestation.",

    "abstract": "Twin or multiple pregnancies often have neonatal complications. Common complications include low birth weight, respiratory distress, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (>5\u00a0days) and low APGAR score especially on second twin. (1) To compare referral rates of newborn hearing screening in twins and triplets between risk and non-risk babies for hearing loss, (2) to determine the effects of birth order on referral rates in twins and triplets. A retrospective study was carried out from the case records of the neonates enrolled in the referral based NICU hearing screening program during April 2013 to December 2014 at Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chennai. 1405 neonates (723 males and 682 females) in the age range of 3-28\u00a0days were screened during this period among which 76 were twins (38 pairs) and 9 were triplets (3 sets). We classified them further into non risk and risk babies among twins according to the Joint Committee for Infant Hearing (JCIH) recommendations. A dual step hearing screening protocol was used to screen the neonates. They were initially tested with distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) then with automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) before discharged from the hospital. Out of 76 (100%) twin babies 43 (56.58%) babies had one or more risk factors for hearing loss. Most common risk factors were low birth weight, premature birth, mechanical ventilation >5\u00a0days, hyperbilirubinemia, infections, ototoxic medications and family history of hearing loss. Each risk factor was observed in equal proportion in 1st born and 2nd born twins. 12 (15.76%) risk babies and 11 (14.47%) non risk babies failed in DPOAE testing. Out of 9 triplets babies (3 set) 3 babies had risk factors for hearing loss. One baby in 2nd born babies group failed AABR screening. Referral rates were slightly higher in 2nd born twins when compared to 1st born twins in DPOAE testing. Chi square test did not reveal any significant association between referral rates with risk factors and birth order (",

    "abstract": "Alport syndrome is an X-linked syndrome that results in nephritis, renal failure, sensorineural hearing loss, and eye deficits. As a result of sensorineural hearing loss, these individuals are likely to experience difficulties in the area of speech and language. While studies in the past have examined the speech and language characteristics of children with syndromic sensorineural hearing loss, to our knowledge there are no previous studies to have documented the speech and language characteristics of these children on a long-term basis. The current study addresses this limitation by reporting speech, language, hearing, and function of twin brothers with X-linked Alport syndrome across a seven-year period. Information was collected by examining the medical records of the participants as well as through a verbal interview with the participants' guardian. Results revealed that the participants' hearing abilities gradually deteriorated over the seven-year period which affected their speech and language development as well. The kidney function tests revealed significant presence of hematuria (blood in the urine) as well as proteinuria (protein in the urine) suggesting chronic kidney dysfunction. This longitudinal study demonstrates the functional relationship between the kidneys and the cochlea, although they appear to be independent of one another. As individuals with Alport syndrome exhibit systemic complications, interdisciplinary collaboration is essential among health care providers including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, nephrologists, and ophthalmologist to promote evidence-based practice.",

    "abstract": "Late-onset transient adrenal insufficiency with circulatory collapse is a rare condition that occurs in preterm infants. Although the incidence of late-onset transient adrenal insufficiency in preterm infants has been reported in Japan, reports from Western countries are lacking. In addition, no study has investigated the effect of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) in monozygotic twins.\nA pair of extremely low birth weight twins presented with TTTS.\nBoth twins developed late-onset adrenal insufficiency with oliguria, hypotension, hyponatremia, and pulmonary edema at a postnatal age of 24 days and 51 days, respectively.\nTemporary administration of intravenous hydrocortisone was initiated.\nTheir symptoms improved dramatically and they survived the event without any neurologic sequelae after 3 years of follow-up.\nLate-onset circulatory collapse may occur, especially in extremely preterm infants, even at 2 months after birth. Hydrocortisone therapy is an effective treatment to rescue circulatory collapse caused by adrenal insufficiency in preterm infants and may not affect long-term neuromotor and cognitive outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are identical twins with fused bodies, joined in utero. They are rare complications of monochorionic twinning. The purpose of this study is to describe the various types of conjoined twins, the role of imaging and recent advances aiding in their management.\nThis was a twin institutional study involving 3 cases of conjoined twins diagnosed over a period of 6 years from 2010 to 2015. All the 3 cases were identified antenatally by ultrasound. Only one case was further evaluated by MRI.\nThree cases of conjoined twins (cephalopagus, thoracopagus and omphalopagus) were accurately diagnosed on antenatal ultrasound. After detailed counseling of the parents and obtaining written consent, all the three cases of pregnancy were terminated. Delivery of the viable conjoined twins was achieved without any complications to the mothers, and all the three conjoined twins died after a few minutes.\nUltrasound enables an early and accurate diagnosis of conjoined twins, which is vital for obstetric management. MRI is reserved for better tissue characterization. Termination of pregnancy when opted, should be done at an early stage as later stages are fraught with problems. Recent advances, such as 3D printing, may aid in surgical pre-planning, thereby enabling successful surgical separation of conjoined twins.",

Upon admission, the patient was awake and orientated and presented a blood pressure of 180/120\u2009mmHg and a protein value of 3+ on urine dipstick test. Clinical examination-ultrasound was not available-led to the admission diagnosis: obstructed labor with intrauterine fetal death and preeclampsia. Application of Hydralazine 5\u2009mg (i.v.) under close blood pressure monitoring was performed. Under spontaneous progression of labor, one head of the yet unknown conjoined twin was born.

    "abstract": "Use or abuse of opioids and related drugs during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal and neonatal morbidities, including increased susceptibility to Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). Severity of NAS is determined by both environmental and genetic factors, but the level of influence each one of them has in determining the severity of NAS is not fully understood. Since the incidence and severity of NAS vary a lot among susceptible infants, twin studies might give us valuable insights into understanding the relative roles of environmental and genetic factors at the onset of the disease and during its progression. Higher concordance of occurrence and severity of NAS in monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins would suggest a genetic role in the pathogenesis of NAS. However, comparable concordance suggests a non-genetic or an environmental basis. In this case series, we report neonatal outcomes including severity of NAS among monozygotic and dizygotic twins.\nA retrospective chart review was performed for all newborn twins who were at risk of developing NAS, were born in our institution between January 2006 and December 2014, and had a gestational age of 30\u2009weeks or greater.\nDuring the study period, we identified seven sets (total of 14 infants) of eligible twins, comprising six dizygotic and one monozygotic twins, from a total of 550 infants who were at risk of developing NAS. Among the seven sets of twins, two sets were concordant for severe NAS and required pharmacological management, three sets of twins were concordant in not having severe NAS and did not require pharmacological management, and the remaining two sets were discordant, where one of the twins required pharmacological treatment.\nFive of the seven sets of twins in our study exhibited concordance and two sets showed discordance in withdrawal severity. Larger studies may help in understanding the roles of genetic and environmental factors in determining the severity of NAS.",

    "abstract": "Smoking is associated with negative health of skin and increased signs of facial ageing. We aimed to address two questions about smoking and appearance: (1) does facial appearance alone provide an indication of smoking status, and (2) how does smoking affect the attractiveness of faces? We used faces of identical twins discordant for smoking, and prototypes made by averaging the faces of the twins. In Task 1, we presented exemplar twin sets and same sex prototypes side-by-side and participants (",

    "abstract": "Lung function is an important predictor of morbidity and mortality, with accelerated lung function decline reported to have immense consequences for the world's healthcare systems. The lung function decline across individual's lifetime is a consequence of age-related changes in lung anatomical structure and combination of various environmental factors; however, the exact molecular mechanisms contributing to this decline are not fully understood. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that changes across individual's lifetime, as well as allows for interplay between environmental and genetic factors. DNA methylation plays a crucial role in regulation of gene expression, with increasing evidence linking aberrant DNA methylation levels with a number of common human diseases. In this study, we investigated possible associations between genome-wide DNA methylation levels and lung function in 169 pairs of middle-aged monozygotic twins (86 male pairs: mean age (min-max)\u2009=\u200966\u00a0years (57-79); 83 female pairs: mean age (min-max)\u2009=\u200966\u00a0years (56-78)). The twins were collected from the Danish Twin Registry and were examined at baseline (1998-1999) and follow-up (2008-2011) visits. Using the twin design, we correlated intra-pair differences in cross-sectional and longitudinal lung function with intra-pair blood DNA methylation differences at follow-up by linear regression analyses adjusted for sex, age, BMI, smoking, and blood cell composition measured for each individual with the use of flow cytometry.\nWe identified several differentially methylated CpG sites associated with forced expiratory volume the first second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Three probes identified for level of FVC were located in \nOur findings suggest that\u00a0epigenetic regulation of immunological- and cancer-related genes, as well as TGF-\u03b2-receptor-related genes, may be involved in the cross-sectional level and longitudinal change in lung function in middle-aged monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Distinction of one twin with respect to the other, based on external appearance, is challenging; nevertheless, facial morphology may provide individualizing features that may help distinguish twin siblings. This study aims at exposing an innovative method for the facial assessment in monozygotic twins for personal identification, based on the registration and comparison of 3D models of faces. Ten couples of monozygotic twins aged between 25 and 69\u202fyears were acquired twice by a stereophotogrammetric system (VECTRA-3D\u00ae M3: Canfield Scientific, Inc., Fairfield, NJ); the 3D reconstruction of each person was then registered and superimposed onto the model belonging to the same person (self-matches), the corresponding sibling (twin-matches) and to unrelated participants from the other couples (miss-matches); RMS (root mean square) point-to-point distances were automatically calculated for all the 220 superimpositions. One-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the differences among miss-matches, twin-matches and self-matches (p\u202f<\u202f.05). RMS values for self-matches, twin-matches and miss-matches were respectively 1.0\u202fmm (SD: 0.3\u202fmm), 1.9\u202fmm (0.5\u202fmm) and 3.4\u202fmm (0.70\u202fmm). Statistically significant differences were found among the three groups (p\u202f<\u202f.01). Comparing RMS values in the three groups, mean facial variability in twin siblings was 55.9% of that assessed between unrelated persons and about twice higher than that observed between models belonging to the same individual. The present study proposed an innovative method for the facial assessment of twin siblings, based on 3D surface analysis, which may provide additional information concerning the relation between genes and environment.",

    "abstract": "Our study analyzed lymphocyte subpopulations of 32 monozygotic twins and compared the level of the catalytic reverse transcriptase protein subunit (hTERT) in T lymphocytes (Tly), helper- (Th), cytotoxic- (Tc) and regulatory T cell (Treg) subgroups. Four variables related to telomere and mitochondrial biology were simultaneously assessed, applying multi-parametric flow cytometry, TRAP-ELISA assay and qPCR standard curve method on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples of genetically matched individuals. Twin data of telomerase activity (TA), hTERT protein level, telomere length (TL) and mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) were analyzed for co-twin similarity. The present study has provided novel information by demonstrating very high intraclass correlation (ICC) of hTERT protein level in T lymphocytes (0.891) and in both Th (0.896), Treg (0.885) and Tc (0.798) cell subgroups. When comparing results measured from PBMCs, intraclass correlation was also high for telomere length (0.815) and considerable for mtDNA copy number (0.524), and again exceptionally high for the rate-limiting telomerase subunit, hTERT protein level (0.946). In contrast, telomerase activity showed no co-twin similarity (ICC 0). By comparing relative amounts of hTERT protein levels in different lymphocyte subgroups of twin subjects, in Treg cells significantly higher level could be detected compared to Tly, Th or Tc cell subgroups. This is the first study that simultaneously analyzed co-twin similarity in MZ twins for the above four variables and alongside assessed their relationship, whereby positive association was found between TL and mtDNAcn.",

    "abstract": "Adult height is a function of genetic predispositions and environmental influences during childhood. Hence, any variation in height among monozygotic twins, who share genetic predispositions, is bound to reflect differences in their environmental exposure. Therefore, a height premium in earnings among monozygotic twins also reflects such exposure. In this study, we analyze the height premium over the life cycle among Swedish twins, 10,000 of whom are monozygotic. The premium is relatively constant over the life cycle, amounting to 5-6% higher earnings per decimeter for men and less for women, suggesting that environmental conditions in childhood and youth affect earnings over most of the adult life course. The premium is larger below median height for men and above median height for young women. The estimates are similar for monozygotic and dizygotic twins, indicating that environmentally and genetically induced height differences are similarly associated with earnings.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins participate in research that partitions variance in health, disease, and behavior into genetic and environmental components. However, there are other innovative roles for twins in medical research. One such way is involving MZ and/or DZ twins in co-twin control-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs). To our knowledge, no reviews have been conducted that summarizes the involvement of twins in RCTs. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature search using the U.S. Clinical Trials Database, NHS electronic databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsychINFO for RCTs on publications involving MZ and/or DZ twins as RCT participants. Out of the 186,027 clinical trials registered in the U.S. clinical trial register ClinicaTrails.gov, only six RCTs used twins as participants. From 1,598 articles identified in our search, 50 peer-reviewed English language publications met our pre-defined inclusion criteria. Sample sizes for RCTs have ranged from a total number of participants from 2 to 1,162; however, 32 (64%) studies had a sample size of 100 or less, and of those, 12 (24%) had fewer than 10. Both MZ and DZ twins have been recruited to the RCTs. In most instances (33/50) each twin from a pair were assigned to different study arms. Most of those studies included MZ twins only. Despite the methodological advantages, the use of MZ and DZ twins as participants in interventional RCTs appeared limited. The continuous development of innovative twin designs, especially RCTs, indicates that twin research can extend beyond the more widely recognized heritability estimates.",

    "abstract": "To examine the association between exposure to surgery and 10-year change in cognitive functioning.\nAmong 2351 middle-aged twins, a 10-year change in composite cognitive scores derived from five cognitive tests was compared between 903 (38%) twins exposed to surgery classified as major, minor, knee and hip replacement, and other, and a reference group of 1448 (62%) twins without surgery, using linear regression models adjusted for socioeconomic factors. Genetic and shared environmental confounding was addressed in intrapair analyses of 48 monozygotic and 74 dizygotic same-sexed twin pairs.\nIn individual-level analyses, twins with major surgery (mean difference,\u00a0-0.37; 95% CI,\u00a0-0.76 to 0.02) or knee and hip replacement surgery (mean difference,\u00a0-0.54; 95% CI,\u00a0-1.30 to 0.22) had a tendency of a negligibly higher rate of decline in cognitive score than the reference group. In the intrapair analyses, the surgery-exposed twin had a higher rate of cognitive decline than the co-twin in 55% (95% CI, 45% to 63%) of the pairs. The mean difference in cognitive decline within pairs was\u00a0-0.21 (95% CI,\u00a0-0.81 to 0.39).\nNo significant associations were found between exposure to surgery and change in cognitive score either in individual-level or in intrapair analyses.",

    "abstract": "To create antenatal gender-specific reference growth charts in uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic twins.\nThis is a prospective longitudinal study in which uncomplicated monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies were included from 23 + 4 weeks of gestation onwards. Estimated fetal weight (EFW) and biometric parameters (biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length) were evaluated in both fetuses every 2 weeks using standardized methodology. Maternal and fetal complications were excluded. Charts were fitted for each biometric parameter and EFW in relation to gestational age and fetal gender using multilevel mixed models.\nThe final analysis included a total of 456 ultrasound examinations in 62 MC twins, with a mean of 7 scans per pregnancy (range 5-8). The mean as well as 5th and 95th percentiles of each biometric parameter and EFW were adjusted in relation to gender and gestational age between 24 and 37 weeks of gestation. Male fetuses have higher reference values than females, and the disparity is larger in the upper centiles of the distribution.\nWe provide gender-specific reference growth charts for MC twins. We suggest that these charts will improve prenatal MC twin assessment and surveillance, with a more accurate classification of normal or growth-restricted fetuses adjusted per sex.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a multifactorial disease with complex genetic inheritance. In children under the age of 5 years, the diagnosis of asthma is a challenge.\nWe present the case of twin sisters under the same treatment for persistent asthma, but with different evolution over the time.\nOne of the sister is diagnosed with severe persistent bronchial asthma associated with bronchiectasis and dyslipidemia and the other one only with mild persistent asthma.\nAt each admission the treatment for the exacerbations and the underlying respiratory infections was represented by antibiotics, short-acting \u03b22 agonists, and, sometimes, oxygen and systemic corticosteroids. As chronic treatment, they received in the last period inhaled corticosteroids associated with long-acting \u03b22 agonist.\nUntil the age of 6.5 years, they had similar diagnoses and treatment; from this point one was asymptomatic, with normal pulmonary function tests. The other one had a more complicated evolution which led to a severe crisis by the age of 10 years old.\nAlthough asthma is a multifactorial disease with complex genetic inheritance, the genetics has its limits. Our twins had a similar onset with the same genetic inheritance, with the same risk factors, with the same comorbidities and with the same treatment. In this context, different evolutions of severe persistent asthma require more extensive genetic investigations.\nWe present the case of twin sisters under the same treatment for persistent asthma, but with different evolution over the time.",

    "abstract": "Usually, cold working strengthen metals and alloys by introducing large population of dislocations, whereas annealing of cold worked metal recovers the structure, annihilates dislocations, forms new strain-free grains, and results loss of strength. Here, we report annealing-hardening at temperature well below stress relieving and recrystallization temperatures in contrast to the typical behavior. A large amount of structural defects, such as dislocations, grain boundaries, twins, and stacking faults, have been introduced in nanostructured \u03b1-brass by cryorolling. The interaction and rearrangement of these defects upon annealing at 165-200\u2009\u00b0C have been monitored at an interval of 1\u2009minute. Large increase of the yield strength up to 578\u2009MPa has been achieved in annealed specimens, which is 23% higher than that of as-cryorolled, and 425% higher than that of as-cast brass due to the evolution of nano-twins. Our approach shows a new avenue on strengthening fcc crystals by incorporating annealing induced nano-twins.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that cervical incompetence and associated preterm birth confers greater morbidity and mortality on birth outcomes, with an additional increased risk of cervical incompetence in higher order gestations. While the pathophysiology of cervical incompetence has yet to be elucidated, research has identified risk factors and assessed outcomes of numerous interventions. Cervical cerclage has been shown, in certain situations involving singleton pregnancies, to improve outcomes. Conversely, rescue cerclage increases the risk of preterm birth in twin gestations. However, these studies did not consider the unique situation of infertile patients, with known cervical incompetence, who have utilized assisted reproductive technologies to attain pregnancy. This study aims to describe the outcomes of infertile patients with known cervical incompetence, carrying twin gestation, who have undergone cervical cerclage.\nThis case series includes eight infertile patients who have cervical incompetence resulting in fetal loss between 20-24 weeks after in vitro fertilization embryo transfer (IVF-ET). These patients continued with IVF treatments and subsequently conceived twins. All patients underwent prophylactic cervical cerclage placement before 12 weeks. The outcomes of these pregnancies are reviewed.\nAll pregnancies resulted in the delivery of viable twins. Six of the eight pregnancies (75%) were carried beyond 34 weeks. One pregnancy delivered at 31 weeks and one pregnancy delivered at 25 weeks after placental abruption.\nThis data suggest that the use of prophylactic cervical cerclage may be beneficial in improving reproductive outcomes in infertile patients with known cervical incompetence that subsequently conceived twin gestations via IVF-ET treatment.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common birth defects. More than 200 susceptibility loci have been identified for CHDs, yet a large part of the genetic risk factors remain unexplained. Monozygotic (MZ) twins are thought to be completely genetically identical; however, discordant phenotypes have been found in MZ twins. Recent studies have demonstrated genetic differences between MZ twins. We aimed to test whether copy number variants (CNVs) and/or genetic mutation differences play a role in the etiology of CHDs by using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays and whole exome sequencing of twin pairs discordant for CHDs. Our goal was to identify mutations present only in the affected twins, which could identify novel candidates for CHD susceptibility loci. We present a comprehensive analysis for the CNVs and genetic mutation results of the selected individuals but detected no consistent differences within the twin pairs. Our study confirms that chromosomal structure or genetic mutation differences do not seem to play a role in the MZ twins discordant for CHD.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins are valuable in assessing the genetic vs environmental contribution to diseases. In the era of complete genome sequences, they allow identification of mutational mechanisms and specific genes and pathways that offer predisposition to the development of complex diseases including schizophrenia.\nWe sequenced the complete genomes of two pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia (MZD), including one representing a family tetrad. The family specific complete sequences have allowed identification of post zygotic mutations between MZD genomes. It allows identification of affected genes including relevant network and pathways that may account for the diseased state in pair specific patient.\nWe found multiple twin specific sequence differences between co-twins that included small nucleotides [single nucleotide variants (SNV), small indels and block substitutions], copy number variations (CNVs) and structural variations. The genes affected by these changes belonged to a number of canonical pathways, the most prominent ones are implicated in schizophrenia and related disorders. Although these changes were found in both twins, they were more frequent in the affected twin in both pairs. Two specific pathway defects, glutamate receptor signaling and dopamine feedback in cAMP signaling pathways, were uniquely affected in the two patients representing two unrelated families.\nWe have identified genome-wide post zygotic mutations in two MZD pairs affected with schizophrenia. It has allowed us to use the threshold model and propose the most likely cause of this disease in the two patients studied. The results support the proposition that each schizophrenia patient may be unique and heterogeneous somatic de novo events may contribute to schizophrenia threshold and discordance of the disease in monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been generated from patients with various forms of disease, including Danon disease (DD); however, few reports exist regarding disease-specific iPSCs derived from clinically divergent monozygotic twins.\nWe examined the characteristics of iPSCs and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) generated from clinically divergent monozygotic female twins with DD.\nWe generated iPSCs derived from T-cells isolated from clinically divergent, 18-year-old female twins with DD harboring a mutation in LAMP2 at the intron 6 splice site (IVS6+1_4delGTGA). Two divergent populations of iPSCs could prepare from each twin despite of their clinical divergence: one with wild-type LAMP2 expression (WT-iPSCs) and a second with mutant LAMP2 expression (MT-iPSCs). The iPSCs were differentiated into iPSC-CMs and then autophagy failure was observed only in MT-iPSC-CMs by electron microscopy, tandem fluorescent-tagged LC3 analysis, and LC3-II western blotting. Under these conditions, X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) was determined by PCR for the (CAG)n repeat in the androgen receptor gene, revealing an extremely skewed XCI pattern with the inactivated paternal wild-type and maternal mutant X-chromosomes in MT-iPSCs and WT-iPSCs, respectively, from each twin.\nRegardless of their clinical differences, we successfully established two sets of iPSC lines that expressed either wild-type or mutant LAMP2 allele from each monozygotic twin with DD, of which only the populations expressing mutant LAMP2 showed autophagic failure.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of twin pregnancies has increased steadily for the last 40\u00a0years due to assisted reproductive technology and increased maternal childbearing age. Multiple pregnancies, especially monochorionic twin pregnancies, carry a high risk for the mother and the fetuses and require close follow-up. Twins are exposed to a higher risk of perinatal anoxia, in utero fetal demise, preterm birth, congenital malformations, fetal growth restriction, and vascular complications. Compared to singletons, twins are at higher risk of perinatal mortality and impaired neurodevelopmental outcome, justifying a thorough follow-up by pediatricians, including assessment and management of familial and psychosocial impact. This paper discusses the epidemiological, obstetrical, and genetic issues raised by twin pregnancies and reviews the data on the perinatal and neurological long-term outcomes of twins, as well as the psychosocial impact of multiple births on twins and their families.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate cheiloscopic patterns among monozygotic twins (MT), non-twin siblings (NTS) and unrelated individuals (UI). The sample consisted of 20 pairs of monozygotic twins (G1), 20 pairs of non-twin siblings (G2) and 20 pairs of unrelated individuals (G3). Lip thickness, commissures and grooves were evaluated and the latter were classified as: I - clear-cut vertical grooves; I' - incomplete vertical grooves; II - branched grooves; III - intersecting; IV - reticular grooves and V - undetermined, in 8 labial regions (sub-quadrants). The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, with a 5% significance level. Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Kappa coefficient, with a 95% confidence interval, were employed to check for agreement rates between G1, G2 and G3 pairs. There was a weak correlation for lip thickness (<0.90) in the total group, with higher values in G1 (CCC from 0.25 to 0.83 and from 0.34 to 0.86, upper and lower lips, respectively), followed by G2 (CCC from -0.03 to 0.70 and from -0.21 to 0.62, upper and lower lips, respectively) and G3 (CCC from -0.25 to 0.56 and from -0.38 to 0.34, upper and lower lips, respectively). With regard to labial commissures, Kappa statistic values were found to be 1.00 for G1, 0.45 for G2 and -0.24 for G3. As for the main groove pattern by sub-quadrant, Kappa values ranged from 0.48 to 0.87 for G1, from 0.17 to 0.59 for G2, and from -0.18 to 0.19 for G3. Monozygotic twins presented a relevant percentage of cheiloscopic agreements. Similarities were also found among NTS, while UI showed greater differences compared to their pairs, highlighting the influence of hereditary relationships on inherited cheiloscopic features.",

    "abstract": "Childhood gender nonconformity (femininity in males, masculinity in females) predicts a nonstraight (gay, lesbian, or bisexual) sexual orientation in adulthood. In previous work, nonstraight twins reported more childhood gender nonconformity than their genetically identical, but straight, cotwins. However, self-reports could be biased. We therefore assessed gender nonconformity via ratings of photographs from childhood and adulthood. These ratings came from independent observers na\u00efve to study hypotheses. Identical twins with discordant sexual orientations (24 male pairs, 32 female pairs) visibly differed in their gender nonconformity from mid-childhood, with higher levels of gender nonconformity observed in the nonstraight twins. This difference was smaller than the analogous difference between identical twins who were concordant straight (4 male pairs, 11 female pairs) and identical twins unrelated to them who were concordant nonstraight (19 male pairs, 8 female pairs). Further, twins in discordant pairs correlated in their observer-rated gender nonconformity. Nongenetic factors likely differentiated the discordant twins' gender-related characteristics in childhood, but shared influences made them similar in some respects. We further tested how recall of past rejection from others related to gender nonconformity. Rejection generally increased with gender nonconformity, but this effect varied by the twins' sexual orientation. (PsycINFO Database Record",

    "abstract": "In the present case study, we investigated possible emotional connectedness between monozygotic twins by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During the experimental condition, Twin 2 was randomly selected to participate in the neuroimaging protocol while Twin 1 participated in the experimental condition outside the MRI scanner (none of them was aware of the experimental procedure). The experimental condition included two sessions with visual and acoustic stimuli, respectively. Between the two experimental conditions, there was a 2-min break with Twin 1 (i.e., the subject outside the scanner) relaxing with eyes closed. Data analysis revealed significant brain activation in three regions, namely left orbitofrontal gyrus (during visual condition) and left cingulum and precentral gyrus (during the acoustic condition). Our findings denote emotional connectedness between a pair of monozygotic twins using fMRI. Further studies in larger sample sizes are needed to investigate if this is a generalized and systematic phenomenon or an incidental finding.",

    "abstract": "The therapeutic management of obesity is challenging, hence further elucidating the underlying mechanisms of obesity development and identifying new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets are urgent and necessary. Here, we performed differential gene expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify significant genes and specific modules related to BMI based on gene expression profile data of 7 discordant monozygotic twins.\nIn the differential gene expression analysis, it appeared that 32 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were with a trend of up-regulation in twins with higher BMI when compared to their siblings. Categories of positive regulation of nitric-oxide synthase biosynthetic process, positive regulation of NF-kappa B import into nucleus, and peroxidase activity were significantly enriched within GO database and NF-kappa B signaling pathway within KEGG database. DEGs of NAMPT, TLR9, PTGS2, HBD, and PCSK1N might be associated with obesity. In the WGCNA, among the total 20 distinct co-expression modules identified, coral1 module (68 genes) had the strongest positive correlation with BMI (r\u2009=\u20090.56, P\u2009=\u20090.04) and disease status (r\u2009=\u20090.56, P\u2009=\u20090.04). Categories of positive regulation of phospholipase activity, high-density lipoprotein particle clearance, chylomicron remnant clearance, reverse cholesterol transport, intermediate-density lipoprotein particle, chylomicron, low-density lipoprotein particle, very-low-density lipoprotein particle, voltage-gated potassium channel complex, cholesterol transporter activity, and neuropeptide hormone activity were significantly enriched within GO database for this module. And alcoholism and cell adhesion molecules pathways were significantly enriched within KEGG database. Several hub genes, such as GAL, ASB9, NPPB, TBX2, IL17C, APOE, ABCG4, and APOC2 were also identified. The module eigengene of saddlebrown module (212 genes) was also significantly correlated with BMI (r\u2009=\u20090.56, P\u2009=\u20090.04), and hub genes of KCNN1 and AQP10 were differentially expressed.\nWe identified significant genes and specific modules potentially related to BMI based on the gene expression profile data of monozygotic twins. The findings may help further elucidate the underlying mechanisms of obesity development and provide novel insights to research potential gene biomarkers and signaling pathways for obesity treatment. Further analysis and validation of the findings reported here are important and necessary when more sample size is acquired.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Tumor Protein P63 (TP63)-related disorders are known to present with a range of phenotypic features, including ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, cleft lip/palate, Rapp-Hodgkin, Hay-Wells, and limb-mammary syndromes. We present six individuals from three families, including a set of monozygotic twins, with pathogenic TP63 variants who had novel clinical findings. The twins were discordant for cleft lip and palate, and the type of hand malformations, but concordant for choanal atresia, and bilateral volar nail. Both failed newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to T-cell lymphopenia. The second family included three family members across two generations. Two of these three family members had orofacial clefting, but the remaining child had a laryngeal web and hydrocele with no clefting or hand anomalies, highlighting the variable expressivity in TP63-related disorders. The individual from the third family had unilateral cleft lip and palate, hydronephrosis, and bilateral volar nails. Together, these cases illustrate that: there is significant familial variability, including discordant major but concordant minor anomalies in the first ever reported set of molecularly confirmed monozygotic twins with pathogenic variants in TP63; pathogenic variants in TP63 should be considered in individuals with volar nail, which was previously only strongly associated with 4q34 deletion syndrome; and failed SCID newborn screening due to abnormal immune functioning may be part of the phenotypic spectrum of TP63-related disorders, as it was reported in one prior individual and two of the individuals in our case series.",

    "abstract": "Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) is a promising measure of long-term hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Previous research has suggested an association between HCC and psychological variables, and initial studies of inter-individual variance in HCC have implicated genetic factors. However, whether HCC and psychological variables share genetic risk factors remains unclear. The aims of the present twin study were to: (i) assess the heritability of HCC; (ii) estimate the phenotypic and genetic correlation between HPA axis activity and the psychological variables perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and neuroticism; using formal genetic twin models and molecular genetic methods, i.e. polygenic risk scores (PRS). HCC was measured in 671 adolescents and young adults. These included 115 monozygotic and 183 dizygotic twin-pairs. For 432 subjects PRS scores for plasma cortisol, major depression, and neuroticism were calculated using data from large genome wide association studies. The twin model revealed a heritability for HCC of 72%. No significant phenotypic or genetic correlation was found between HCC and the three psychological variables of interest. PRS did not explain variance in HCC. The present data suggest that HCC is highly heritable. However, the data do not support a strong biological link between HCC and any of the investigated psychological variables.",

    "abstract": "Twin research has offered evidence that monozygotic (MZ) twins are more socially close than dizygotic (DZ) twins, but has not paid much attention to the way twins compare themselves with their co-twin. The few studies in this area suggest that 'horizontal comparisons' (social comparison motivated by solidarity or communion with others) matter more for MZ twins than for DZ twins, at least when the co-twin is the social comparison standard. Consistent with this view, we predicted higher interest in MZ twins relative to DZ twins to select their co-twin rather than other people in general as the social comparison standard. The Social Comparison Orientation (SCO) scale, which measures the inclination to compare with others in a horizontal rather than vertical mode (comparing either upward or downward), was administered in 90 MZ pairs and 57 same-sex DZ pairs (63% female; average age 18.06 years) from the Netherlands Twin Register. MZ twin pairs showed significantly higher SCO scores than DZ twin pairs (with a large effect size) on the co-twin SCO, whereas the two groups did not differ from each other on the general SCO excluding the co-twin as social comparison standard. In MZ twin pairs, anxiety was associated with social comparison with others in general, not with their co-twin. For both scales, twin resemblance was explained by additive genetic variance. The present findings provide direct evidence that horizontal comparisons with the co-twin are of particular importance for MZ twins.",

No significant differences in terms of benefit or risk were found when comparing repeated courses with a single complete course.\nIn preterm twins, a single complete course of antenatal corticosteroids was associated with an improvement of severe neurological outcome, whereas reduced in-hospital mortality was seen only when the ACS-to-delivery interval was \u22647\u00a0days.\nA single complete course of antenatal steroids reduced severe neurological morbidity in preterm twins (24-31\u00a0weeks).",

    "abstract": "Acne vulgaris is a skin disease with a multifactorial and complex pathology. While several twin studies have estimated that acne has a heritability of up to 80%, the genomic elements responsible for the origin and pathology of acne are still undiscovered. Here we performed a twin-based structural equation model, using available data on acne severity for an Australian sample of 4,491 twins and their siblings aged from 10 to 24. This study extends by a factor of 3 an earlier analysis of the genetic factors of acne. Acne severity was rated by nurses on a 4-point scale (1 = absent to 4 = severe) on up to three body sites (face, back, chest) and on up to three occasions (age 12, 14, and 16). The phenotype that we analyzed was the most severe rating at any site or age. The polychoric correlation for monozygotic twins was higher (r MZ = 0.86, 95% CI [0.81, 0.90]) than for dizygotic twins (r DZ = 0.42, 95% CI [0.35, 0.47]). A model that includes additive genetic effects and unique environmental effects was the most parsimonious model to explain the genetic variance of acne severity, and the estimated heritability was 0.85 (95% CI [0.82, 0.87]). We then conducted a genome-wide analysis including an additional 271 siblings - for a total of 4,762 individuals. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) scan did not detect loci associated with the severity of acne at the threshold of 5E-08 but suggestive association was found for three SNPs: rs10515088 locus 5q13.1 (p = 3.9E-07), rs12738078 locus 1p35.5 (p = 6.7E-07), and rs117943429 locus 18q21.2 (p = 9.1E-07). The 5q13.1 locus is close to PIK3R1, a gene that has a potential regulatory effect on sebocyte differentiation.",

    "abstract": "A case report of monozygotic (MZ) twins with Crouzon syndrome was previously published to highlight variables in clinical presentation. The postnatal and epigenetic causes for this variation are not well understood. An 8-year follow-up discusses their pertinent clinic course with consideration of genetic and nongenetic variables. The phenotypic and symptomatic obstacles encountered since their initial assessment are reviewed, and the use of three-dimensional Medical Modeling (Golden, CO) as a preoperative planning strategy is addressed. Analyzing the longitudinal clinical course of MZ twins with syndromic craniosynostosis will help better predict and provide optimal treatment.",

    "abstract": "Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals report higher levels of depression and anxiety than heterosexual people. Genetic factors may be a 'common cause' of sexual minority status and psychological distress. Alternatively, these may be correlated because of non-genetic environmental factors (e.g. minority stressors). This study investigated minority stressors and distress in monozygotic twins discordant for sexual minority status. This design provides a test of the role of non-shared environmental factors while minimizing differences due to genetics.\nThirty-eight twin pairs in which one was heterosexual and the other was LGB completed a survey. Differences between twin pairs in minority stressors, rumination, psychological distress, and gender non-conformity were examined. Associations between these variables were also tested.\nAlthough there were no significant group differences for distress, LGB twins had higher rumination, a vulnerability factor for distress, than heterosexual co-twins. LGB twins also had higher scores than heterosexual co-twins on expectations of rejection, active concealment, self-stigma, prejudice events, childhood gender non-conformity, and lower scores on sexual orientation disclosure. Differences between twin pairs in rumination were positively associated with differences in acceptance concerns and self-stigma. Finally, self-stigma was positively associated with rumination in the full sample of heterosexual co-twins and microaggressions were positively associated with rumination when looking at exclusively heterosexual co-twins.\nThese results support environmental factors as a causal explanation for disparities in rumination between LGB and heterosexual individuals. These factors likely include minority stressors. Rumination may also be associated with minority stressors in heterosexual MZ co-twins of LGB individuals.",

    "abstract": "The ABCD twin study will elucidate the genetic and environmental contributions to a wide range of mental and physical health outcomes in children, including substance use, brain and behavioral development, and their interrelationship. Comparisons within and between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, further powered by multiple assessments, provide information about genetic and environmental contributions to developmental associations, and enable stronger tests of causal hypotheses, than do comparisons involving unrelated children. Thus a sub-study of 800 pairs of same-sex twins was embedded within the overall Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) design. The ABCD Twin Hub comprises four leading centers for twin research in Minnesota, Colorado, Virginia, and Missouri. Each site is enrolling 200 twin pairs, as well as singletons. The twins are recruited from registries of all twin births in each State during 2006-2008. Singletons at each site are recruited following the same school-based procedures as the rest of the ABCD study. This paper describes the background and rationale for the ABCD twin study, the ascertainment of twin pairs and implementation strategy at each site, and the details of the proposed analytic strategies to quantify genetic and environmental influences and test hypotheses critical to the aims of the ABCD study.",

    "abstract": "Findings from twin studies of musical interests and talent are reviewed as a backdrop to the lives and careers of twin jazz musicians, Peter and Will Anderson. The Anderson twins exemplify many aspects of twin research, namely their matched musical abilities, shared musical interests, and common career. This overview is followed by reviews of studies and case reports of bereavement in families who have lost a preterm multiple birth infant, the conception of conjoined twins following in vitro fertilization (IVF), depression in fathers of twins, and twin-to-twin transfusion incidence in monochorionic-diamniotic IVF twin pairs. Twins highlighted in the media include high-achieving identical female twins with nearly identical academic standing, tennis star Roger Federer's two sets of identical twin children, surgical separation of craniopagus conjoined twins, and the rare delivery of twins to a 23-year-old giant panda.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to study the global DNA Methylation in monozygotic (MZ) twins with cerebral palsy. Two pairs of twins (a cerebral palsy children, a normal child) admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were selected as subjects. The phenol-chloroform method was used to extract DNA from venous blood and micro satellite DNA genotyping technique was used to identify the eggs of the twins. DNA methylation fragments were enriched by MBD affinity column chromatography, followed by Solexa sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. In this study, we found that there were different DNA hypermethylation regions between each pair of twins and normal children through global DNA methylation analysis technique by analyzing the blood cells of two pairs of monozygotic twins with cerebral palsy and normal infants. The results revealed the region of DNA methylation and the protein coding genes of promoter region of common methylation of cerebral palsy were both higher than normal children. These common promoter hypermethylation genes in cerebral palsy are involved in a variety of biological processes such as membrane protein transport, neuronal development, apoptosis, and metabolism. Moreover, DNA methylation plays an important role in gene expression. We hypothesized that the onset of cerebral palsy in twins is associated with hypermethylation of the promoter which inhibiting the expression of hypermethylation genes in children with cerebral palsy. The current research provided a basis for further study of the large sample of twins and sporadic cerebral palsy.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies are known to carry a high risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) that could lead to miscarriage and perinatal death. Demise of one fetus is frequently associated with co-fetal death. Fetal reduction by interstitial laser therapy is an effective procedure to prevent this outcome, but it may be associated with significant risks for both mother and fetus. Aplasia Cutis Congenita (ACC) may occur in up to 8% cases of fetal reduction by laser therapy. We report ACC in a preterm infant, a survivor of interstitial laser therapy for fetal reduction in MC pregnancy. Despite of massive skin lesions we were able to manage this case conservatively. Follow-up at 5 years of age revealed minimal scarring and no motor function limitations.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a severe type of brain disease affecting movement and posture. Although CP has strong genetic and environmental components, considerable differences in the methylome between monozygotic\u00a0(MZ) twins discordant for CP implicates epigenetic contributors as well. In order to determine the differences in methylation in patients with CP without interference of the interindividual genomic variation, four pairs of MZ twins discordant for CP were profiled for DNA methylation changes using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing on the genomic\u2011scale. Similar DNA methylation patterns were observed in all samples. However, MZ twins demonstrated higher correlations and closer evolutionary associations compared with the other samples, indicating a stable methylome of MZ twins. A total of 190\u00a0differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified using Student's t\u2011test, of which 37\u00a0genes were hypermethylated in the CP group while the remainders were hypomethylated compared with control group. The identified DMGs were enriched in several cerebral abnormalities, including cerebral cortical atrophy and cerebral atrophy, suggesting that the occurrence of CP may be associated with the methylation alterations. The neighboring genes of DMGs in the protein\u2011protein interaction network were enriched in numerous important functions in essential processes. The results of the present study identified important genes that may epigenetically contribute to the occurrence and development of CP in MZ twins, suggesting that the different prevalence of CP in identical twins may be associated with DNA methylation alterations.",

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology behind autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) is poorly understood, and the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors remains unclear. In this study, we examined the heritability of AAD and explored disease-associated autoimmune comorbidity among Swedish twins.\nA population-based longitudinal cohort of 112,100 Swedish twins was used to calculate the heritability of AAD, and to explore co-occurrence of 10 organ-specific autoimmune disorders in twin pairs with AAD. Diagnoses were collected 1964-2012 through linkage to the Swedish National Patient Register. The Swedish Prescribed Drug Register was used for additional diagnostic precision. When available, biobank serum samples were used to ascertain the AAD diagnosis through identification of 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies.\nWe identified 29 twins with AAD. Five out of nine (5/9) monozygotic pairs and zero out of fifteen (0/15) dizygotic pairs were concordant for AAD. The probandwise concordance for monozygotic twins was 0.71 (95% CI 0.40-0.90) and the heritability 0.97 (95% CI 0.88-99). Autoimmune disease patterns of monozygotic twin pairs affected by AAD displayed a higher degree of similarity than those of dizygotic twins, with an incidence rate ratio of 15 (95% CI 1.8-116) on the number of shared autoimmune diagnoses within pairs.\nThe heritability of AAD appears to be very high, emphasizing the need for further research on the genetic etiology of the disease. Monozygotic twin concordance for multiple autoimmune manifestations suggests strong genetic influence on disease specificity in organ-specific autoimmunity.",

Amniotic fluid karyotyping showed nonmosaic trisomy 21 in twin 1 (47, XY,\u00a0+21 [20]) and a normal karyotype in twin 2 (46, XY [20]). Short tandem repeat (STR) polymorphism markers revealed that the two fetuses were monozygotic, and the two chromosomes 21 were maternal isodisomy in the trisomy fetus. The chromosomal constitution of placentas in the territory of trisomy 21 cotwin was 47, XY,\u00a0+21 [20] and was a mosaic 47, XY+21 [12]/46, XY [8] in the normal karyotyped twin.\nOur case of monozygotic twin with discordant trisomy 21 might start with a prezygotic maternal meiosis II non-disjunction error-caused trisomy 21 zygote, and after twinning, one remained trisomy 21, and the other twin underwent trisomy rescue and became a mosaic trisomy 21 in morula or early blastocyst stage before the formation of pre-embryo, which subsequently resulted in mosaic trisomy 21 of the placental tissue and normal chromosomal constitution of the fetus.",

    "abstract": "Production of sires with high breeding potential is indispensable for prompt and reliable breeding using their semen in the cattle industry. Currently, in Japan, we aim to further the production of Japanese black sires via a new breeding system that uses genetically homologous monozygotic twins so that better growth performance and carcass traits can be translated to the increased production of beef with higher economic value. Several studies have reported that monozygotic twins are produced by embryo bisection. On the other hand, with the evolution and stabilization of in vitro fertilization technology, it has become possible to produce multiple monozygotic twin calves from blastomeres separated from a cleavage-stage embryo. This review attempts to clarify breeding practices through revalidation of the factors that affect the production efficiency of monozygotic twin calves by embryo bisection. Furthermore, the establishment of a system for monozygotic twin embryo production via the simplified technique of blastomere separation is reviewed while showing data from our previously performed studies.",

    "abstract": "Negative cognitive bias and aberrant neural processing of self-referent emotional words seem to be trait-marks of depression. However, it is unclear whether these neurocognitive changes are present in unaffected first-degree relatives and constitute an illness endophenotype.\nFifty-three healthy, never-depressed monozygotic or dizygotic twins with a co-twin history of depression (high-risk group: n = 26) or no first-degree family history of depression (low-risk group: n = 27) underwent neurocognitive testing and functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) as part of a follow-up cohort study. Participants performed a self-referent emotional word categorisation task and free word recall task followed by a recognition task during fMRI. Participants also completed questionnaires assessing mood, personality traits and coping strategies.\nHigh-risk and low-risk twins (age, mean \u00b1 SD: 40 \u00b1 11) were well-balanced for demographic variables, mood, coping and neuroticism. High-risk twins showed lower accuracy during self-referent categorisation of emotional words independent of valence and more false recollections of negative words than low-risk twins during free recall. Functional MRI yielded no differences between high-risk and low-risk twins in retrieval-specific neural activity for positive or negative words or during the recognition of negative versus positive words within the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex.\nThe subtle display of negative recall bias is consistent with the hypothesis that self-referent negative memory bias is an endophenotype for depression. High-risk twins' lower categorisation accuracy adds to the evidence for valence-independent cognitive deficits in individuals at familial risk for depression.",

    "abstract": "A pair of monozygotic 22-year-old twins with complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia caused by a novel SPG11 mutation is described.\nGenetic testing and thorough clinical examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR-spectroscopy were performed.\nThe twins were compound heterozygous for a known frameshift as well as a novel splice site mutation in the SPG11 gene. Clinically the patients showed a similar spectrum of symptoms but different disease presentation. MRI studies including morphometry and regional microstructural analysis by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the corpus callosum (CC) by 3T MRI revealed marked thinning and corresponding increases of radial diffusivity (RD) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and reduction of the fractional anisotropy (FA) as compared to controls in all CC sections, particularly in the anterior callosal body. There was marked mainly supratentorial white matter reduction and to a lesser extent grey matter reduction in both patients. Involvement of the cortico-spinal tracts was reflected by FA and RD alterations. The more strongly affected patient showed a higher degree of callosal microstructural damage and cervical cord atrophy.\nThis study shows a similar symptom spectrum, but distinct clinical and imaging findings in monozygotic twins suffering from SPG 11, suggesting individual downstream genetic effects and/or non-genetic modifiers.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a growing global health concern, with a rapid increase being observed in morbid obesity. Obesity is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk and earlier onset of cardiovascular morbidity. The growing obesity epidemic is a major source of unsustainable health costs and morbidity and mortality because of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, certain cancers and major cardiovascular diseases. Similar to obesity, hypertension is a key unfavorable health metric that has disastrous health implications: currently, hypertension is the leading contributor to global disease burden, and the direct and indirect costs of treating hypertension are exponentially higher. Poor lifestyle characteristics and health metrics often cluster together to create complex and difficult-to-treat phenotypes: excess body mass is such an example, facilitating a cascade of pathophysiological sequelae that create such as a direct obesity-hypertension link, which consequently increases cardiovascular risk. Although some significant issues regarding assessment/management of obesity remain to be addressed and the underlying mechanisms governing these disparate effects of obesity on cardiovascular disease are complex and not completely understood, a variety of factors could have a critical role. Consequently, a comprehensive and exhaustive investigation of this relationship should analyze the pathogenetic factors and pathophysiological mechanisms linking obesity to hypertension as they provide the basis for a rational therapeutic strategy in the aim to fully describe and understand the obesity-hypertension link and discuss strategies to address the potential negative consequences from the perspective of both primordial prevention and treatment for those already impacted by this condition.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to assess shared genetic correlations of depressive and anxiety symptoms with concurrent and future estimated cardiovascular risk (CVR) score in Korean twins and family members. For the relationship with Adult Treatment Panel III CVR estimate in subjects aged 30-74 years (n = 1,059, baseline and follow-up after 3.2 \u00b1 1.2 years), Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and state and trait anxiety inventory (SAI and TAI) were measured at baseline. A mixed linear model for CVR scores at baseline and follow-up was applied to include depressive and anxiety symptoms, twin and family effects, income, education, alcohol use, exercise, body mass index, and baseline CVR score for follow-up analysis. Higher CES-D scores were associated with higher CVR score at baseline in men, while higher TAI score was associated with higher CVR score at follow-up in women. Heritabilities were 0.245~0.326 for CVR score, 0.320 for CES-D score, 0.367 for TAI score, and 0.482 for SAI score. There were significant common genetic correlations in the relationships of CES-D, TAI, and SAI scores with CVR scores at baseline and follow-up (after adjusting for baseline CV risk score). Shared common environmental correlations were observed in the relationships of CES-D and SAI scores with CVR score at baseline; and SAI score with CVR score at follow-up. In the within-monozygotic twin analysis, there were no associations between CES-D, TAI, and SAI scores, and CVR score. In conclusion, shared genetic and environmental influences were observed in the relationship between depressive and anxiety symptoms with concurrent and future CVR estimates.",

    "abstract": "Actin is an important component of the cytoskeleton and its polymerization is delicately regulated by several kinases and phosphatases. Heterotrimeric protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a potent phosphatase that is crucial for cell proliferation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, signal transduction, cytoskeleton arrangement, and neurodegeneration. To facilitate these varied functions, different regulators determine the different targets of PP2A. Among these regulators of PP2A, the B subunits in particular may be involved in cytoskeleton arrangement. However, little is known about the role of PP2A in actin polymerization in vivo. Using sophisticated fly genetics, we demonstrated a novel function for the fly B subunit, twins, to promote actin polymerization in varied tissue types, suggesting a broad and conserved effect. Furthermore, our genetic data suggest that twins may act upstream of the actin-polymerized-proteins, Moesin and Myosin-light-chain, and downstream of Rho to promote actin polymerization. This work opens a new avenue for exploring the biological functions of a PP2A regulator, twins, in cytoskeleton regulation.",

    "abstract": "Whether monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins differ from each other in a variety of phenotypes is important for genetic twin modeling and for inferences made from twin studies in general. We analyzed whether there were differences in individual, maternal and paternal education between MZ and DZ twins in a large pooled dataset. Information was gathered on individual education for 218,362 adult twins from 27 twin cohorts (53% females; 39% MZ twins), and on maternal and paternal education for 147,315 and 143,056 twins respectively, from 28 twin cohorts (52% females; 38% MZ twins). Together, we had information on individual or parental education from 42 twin cohorts representing 19 countries. The original education classifications were transformed to education years and analyzed using linear regression models. Overall, MZ males had 0.26 (95% CI [0.21, 0.31]) years and MZ females 0.17 (95% CI [0.12, 0.21]) years longer education than DZ twins. The zygosity difference became smaller in more recent birth cohorts for both males and females. Parental education was somewhat longer for fathers of DZ twins in cohorts born in 1990-1999 (0.16 years, 95% CI [0.08, 0.25]) and 2000 or later (0.11 years, 95% CI [0.00, 0.22]), compared with fathers of MZ twins. The results show that the years of both individual and parental education are largely similar in MZ and DZ twins. We suggest that the socio-economic differences between MZ and DZ twins are so small that inferences based upon genetic modeling of twin data are not affected.",

    "abstract": "An association between childhood asthma and IgE sensitization has been established, but our understanding of the genetic and environmental contribution to it is incomplete. Our aim was to estimate the associations and dose-response relationship between asthma and sensitization to airborne allergens in Swedish 9- to 14-year-old twins. Additionally, we aimed to explore the importance of familial confounding from shared genes and environment using co-twin controls.\nIn the STOPPA cohort, 752 same-sex twin children were screened with Phadiatop\u00ae (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden); if positive further analysis of IgE antibodies to airborne allergens of pets (cat, horse, dog), pollens (birch, timothy, mugwort), mites, and mold were performed. The associations between asthma and airborne allergens were assessed with generalized estimating equations. The co-twin control analysis was performed by conditional logistic regression.\nChildren with positive Phadiatop\u00ae had more than doubled odds of asthma (OR 2.53, 95% CI [1.74, 3.70]). Sensitization to pet allergens was associated with increased odds of asthma; for example, cat OR 4.15 (95% CI [2.67, 6.45]), with similar estimates for pollens; for example, birch OR 3.22 (95% CI [2.12, 4.91]). Associations persisted with sensitization as a categorical variable and for trend, indicating a dose-response relationship. Results remained in the co-twin analyses; for example, cat OR 4.75 (95% CI [1.62, 14.0]) and birch OR 5.00 (95% CI [1.45, 17.3]).\nThe association between childhood asthma and sensitization to airborne allergens remains in co-twin analyses, indicating they are not due to confounding from shared environmental or genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Perceived age is an easily accessible biomarker of aging. Here, we studied its relation to DNA methylation age (DNAm age) as introduced in (Horvath, 2013) in 180 elderly Danish twins. We found perceived age and DNAm age to be associated with chronological age (P=0.04 resp. P=2.2e-10) when correcting for gender, but did not see an association between perceived age and DNAm age (P=0.44). Intrapair-analysis showed that the proportion of pairs where the twin with the highest perceived age also had the highest DNAm age was not different from 0.5 (P=1), and we did not see a trend when dividing pairs according to their difference in perceived age (P=0.36). Hence, intrapair analysis did not reveal links between perceived age and DNAm age. Moreover, none of the 353 CpGs underlying DNAm age was individually associated with perceived age after correction for multiple-testing (P>6e-4, FDR>0.21). Finally, when constructing an epigenetic signature based on these CpGs to predict perceived age, we only found a correlation of 0.18 (95%CI: -0.06 to 0.40) and a mean square error of 13.6 years",

    "abstract": "Research has repeatedly suggested genetic and environmental factors in the etiology underlying female sexual dysfunction (FSD). Because sexual functioning is a highly variable trait, epigenetics could provide a promising approach to tackle the origins of FSD and consequently offer a step-change in our understanding of these problems.\nTo identify differentially methylated CpG positions for sexual functioning in a sample of monozygotic twin pairs discordant for sexual functioning.\nThe sample consisted of 33 trait-discordant monozygotic twin pairs (mean age\u00a0= 54.1 years, SD\u00a0=\u00a09.05) from the Twins UK Registry. Phenotypic data on sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain were collected using the Female Sexual Function Index-Lifelong (FSFI-LL). The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450 DNA BeadChip was used for epigenome-wide analyses of DNA methylation in whole-blood samples.\nComparison of DNA methylation patterns associated with the FSFI-LL total score and its six subdomains.\nTwo differentially methylated CpG positions (cg09580409 and cg14734994) reaching experiment-wide statistical significance were found for overall sexual functioning, mapping to MGC45800 and the threonine synthase-like 2 gene (THNSL2), respectively. Furthermore, potential biologically relevant candidates for sexual desire (CUB and zona pellucida-like domains 1, CUZD1) and satisfaction (solute carrier family 6 member 19, SLC6A19) were identified.\nTHNSL2 and SLC6A19, which have been linked to weight and adiposity, might represent novel candidates for sexual problems in women.\nThis is the first study to investigate epigenetic mechanisms underlying FSD. The study used a relative small sample of monozygotic female twins. The cutoff to determine discordance in sexual problems was chosen based on a 10% FSFI score difference. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution and need replication in larger clinical samples.\nUnderstanding how genes and environment interact to influence our sexuality might inform clinical practice and lead to new treatments for women experiencing FSD.

    "abstract": "Utilization of laccases in biotechnology and bioremediation has created a strong demand for the characterization of new enzymes and an increase in production of known laccases. Thus, additional research into these enzymes is critically needed. In this study, we report a comparative study of the biochemical and transcriptional properties of two different laccase isozymes from Trametes hirsuta 072 - the constitutive and inducible forms. A recombinant LacC enzyme was expressed in Penicillium canescens to characterize its properties. LacC is single-purpose enzyme, unlike LacA, which can operate efficiently under a wide range of temperatures and pHs (55-70\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 3-5, respectively). LacC has a lower RedOx potential than LacA and does not oxidize substrates containing amine groups. Expression of the lacC gene was selective compared to that of the lacA gene and increased significantly in the presence of complex synthetic compounds such as dyes and xenobiotics. This study shows that laccases from the multigene families of basidiomycetes differ significantly in their properties, thus providing a complementary effect during lignin degradation.",

    "abstract": "To date, it is unclear which factors are associated with parenting stress.\nThere are no studies investigating the association between parenting stress and coping strategies such as coparenting and social support, while simultaneously considering demographic and obstetric factors, in mothers of singletons and twins.\nTo investigate if parenting stress is associated with personal, and obstetric characteristics, the level of coparenting, and the availability of and satisfaction with social support in mothers of singletons and twins until one year postpartum.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 151 singleton mothers and 101 twin mothers were included.\nBoth singleton and twin mothers experiencing lower parenting stress levels indicated a better coparenting relationship quality (\u03b2=-0.253, p<0.01; \u03b2=-0.341, p=0.001). Elevated parenting stress levels positively influenced the level of satisfaction with social support in only mothers of twins (\u03b2=0.273, p<0.01). The availability of social support, personal, and obstetric characteristics were not associated with the level of parenting stress in neither singleton nor twin mothers.\nCoparenting seems to be a significant coping strategy reducing the level of parenting stress in singleton and twin mothers, irrespective of their personal and obstetric characteristics. Large-scale longitudinal research is needed to identify predictors of parenting stress, which may help to develop parenting stress reducing interventions.

Comparing twins with birthweights <10% to \u226510%, there were no significant differences in rates of composite major morbidities (3.2 vs. 1.4%, \n\u2003Twins with SGA <10% born at \u226534 weeks have similar long-term neurodevelopmental and health outcomes compared with twins with normal birthweights. Birthweight less than 5th percentile is associated with an increased risk of major morbidity, specifically cardiac disease, but the absolute risk is low.",

    "abstract": "Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker disease (GSS) is an autosomal, dominantly inherited prion disease. In this study, we present different complicated brain pathologies determined postmortem of monozygotic GSS twin sisters. Case 1 showed cerebellar ataxia at the age of 58\u2009years, and died at 66\u2009years. Case 2 became symptomatic at the age of 75\u2009years, and died at 79\u2009years. There was a 17-year difference in the age of onset between the twins. Postmortem examination revealed numerous prion protein (PrP) plaques in the brains of both cases. The spongiform change and brain atrophy in case 1 were more severe compared with those in case 2. Western-blot analysis identified proteinase-resistant PrP (PrPres) at the molecular weight of 21-30\u2009kDa and 8\u2009kDa in the twins. Gel filtration revealed that PrPres was mainly composed of PrP oligomer. PrPres signal patterns were similar between the twins. Additionally, case 1 showed \u03b1-synucleinopathy and case 2 showed Alzheimer disease pathology. These different proteinopathies were involved in the amyloid plaque formations of both cases. The degree of GSS pathology was mainly related to disease duration. The amyloid plaque formations could be decorated by concomitant neuropathological changes such as \u03b1-synucleinopathy and tauopathy.",

Using meta-analytical methodology, the authors compared these molecules.\nRCTs comparing tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine with placebo in Huntington's disease were searched. The authors assessed the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, calculated indirect treatment comparisons, and applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.\nThe evidence network for this report comprised 1 tetrabenazine trial and 1 deutetrabenazine trial, both against placebo. Risk of bias was moderate in both. Participants in the tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine trials did not differ significantly on motor scores or adverse events. Depression and somnolence scales significantly favored deutetrabenazine.\nThere is low-quality evidence that tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine do not differ in efficacy or safety.

    "abstract": "Foot impressions are of utmost importance in crime scene investigations. Foot impressions are available in the form of barefoot prints, sock-clad footprints, and as impressions within footwear. Sometimes suspects leave their footwear at the crime scene, and the insole of this footwear may contain the foot impression of the suspect which may be important evidence linking him or her to the crime. The task of identification based on the analysis of footprints can be challenging when the footprints belonging to one of the identical twin is available for examination. The present study is based on the quantitative measures of the foot impressions in the footwear of adult identical twins. The study was conducted on four sets of female monozygotic twins from the United States of America. A total of 17 length and breadth measurements were taken on each foot impression. A combination of Reel Method and Extended Gunn Method was utilized to produce the measurements. The measurements of the foot impressions were compared among the twins on the right and the left side. Differences were found in the various footprint measurements among the twins. The study's sample size was not large enough to apply robust statistical tests, but the study is significant in that it presents the first detailed comparative analysis of a large number of measurements of insole foot impressions of adult twins. The observations derived from the study are likely to assist forensic investigations in cases involving the foot impressions of the twins.",

The prognosis for conjoined twins is poor and management in a skilled tertiary care centre is paramount for definitive care. We describe our experience with a telemedical consultation on conjoined twins in The Dominican Republic from our eHealth centre in Valhalla, NY. The patients were two month old, female, pygopagus conjoined twins. A multidisciplinary teleconference was initiated with the patients, their family, the referring paediatrician and our team. Based on this teleconsultation, the team felt as though the twins may be amenable to a surgical separation. They presented to our centre in Valhalla, NY, for a detailed physical examination and series of imaging studies. Soon after, the patients underwent a successful 21\u2009h separation procedure and were discharged 12 weeks later. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of an international teleconsultation leading to a successful conjoined twin separation procedure.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative assessment of tissue anatomy and accurate surgical planning is crucial in conjoined twin separation surgery. We developed a new method that combines three-dimensional (3D) printing, assembling, and casting to produce anatomic models of high fidelity for surgical planning. The related anatomic features of the conjoined twins were captured by computed tomography (CT), classified as five organ groups, and reconstructed as five computer models. Among these organ groups, the skeleton was produced by fused deposition modeling (FDM) using acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene. For the other four organ groups, shell molds were prepared by FDM and cast with silica gel to simulate soft tissues, with contrast enhancement pigments added to simulate different CT and visual contrasts. The produced models were assembled, positioned firmly within a 3D printed shell mold simulating the skin boundary, and cast with transparent silica gel. The produced phantom was subject to further CT scan in comparison with that of the patient data for fidelity evaluation. Further data analysis showed that the produced model reassembled the geometric features of the original CT data with an overall mean deviation of less than 2\u2009mm, indicating the clinical potential to use this method for surgical planning in conjoined twin separation surgery.",

    "abstract": "Nonsyndromic orofacial clefts (OFCs) are complex traits characterized by multifactorial inheritance and wide phenotypic variability. Numerous studies have shown subtle differences in the faces of unaffected relatives from cleft families compared to controls, the implication being that such outward differences are an incomplete expression reflecting an underlying genetic predisposition. Twins discordant for OFCs provide a unique opportunity to further test this idea, as the unaffected co-twin shares on average 50% (for dizygotic twins) and 100% (for monozygotic twins) of the genetic risk factors as the affected twin. We used 3D surface imaging and spatially-dense morphometry to compare facial shape in a sample of 44 unaffected co-twins and age- and sex-matched unaffected controls (n\u2009=\u2009241). Unaffected co-twins showed statistically significant differences in the midface, lateral upper face, and forehead regions, compared to controls. Furthermore, co-twins were characterized by a distinct pattern of midfacial retrusion, broader upper faces, and greater protrusion of the mandible and brow ridges. This same general facial pattern was shown in both unaffected monozygotic and dizygotic co-twin subsets. These results provide additional support that altered facial shape is a phenotypic marker for OFC susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Microdeletions of 20q11.2 are rare but have been associated with characteristic clinical findings. A 1.6\u2009Mb minimal critical region has been identified that includes three OMIM genes: GDF5, EPB41L1, and SAMHD. Here we describe a male monozygotic, monochorionic-diamniotic twin pair with discordant phenotypes, one with multiple findings that overlap with those reported in 20q11.2 deletions, and the other unaffected. Microarray analysis revealed mosaicism for a 363\u2009Kb deletion encompassing GDF5 in the peripheral blood of both twins, which was confirmed by FISH. Subsequent FISH on buccal cells identified the deletion only in the affected twin. The blood FISH findings were interpreted as representing chimerism resulting from anastomosis and the blood exchange between the twins in utero. The implications of this finding are discussed, as is the contribution of GDF5 to the associated clinical findings of 20q11.2 deletions.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the possible effects of genetic and environmental factors on dentofacial complex using monozygotic twins.\nThe study sample was made of 21 pairs of monozygotic twins (14 female pairs and seven male pairs) between 10 and 25 years. Pretreatment lateral cephalo-grams were used which were traced and digitized, and various landmarks to determine the anteroposterior and vertical proportions were marked. Samples were divided into two groups. The correlation between groups was found by calculating Pearson's product moment correlation coefficients.\nThe range of the correlation coefficient was from 0.705 to 0.952. Gonial angle showed the highest correlation coefficient (0.952), while saddle angle showed the lowest correlation coefficient (0.705).\nThe growth and development of craniofacial complex is under mutifactorial control. However, genetic influences do tend to play a dominant role.\nBy studying identical twins, we can study about the interaction of the environment with the genes and how it affects the growth and development of the body in general and dentofacial complex in particular. By utilizing twin studies, we can identify whether a particular trait, disease, or disorder is influenced more strongly by genetics or by the environment. Success of orthodontic treatment depends on a proper diagnosis of the problem including its etiological factors. Genetic studies let the orthodontists to understand the effects of genetic and environmental factors in the growth and development of dentofacial complex better and allows to prevent or treat malocclusions and skeletal anomalies in better ways.",

    "abstract": "To assess the clinical characteristics of fetal aneuploidy between dichorionic twins (DCT) and monochorionic twins (MCT) undergoing invasive prenatal diagnosis.\nTwin fetuses undergoing invasive prenatal diagnosis were enrolled in this study. All twin fetuses were classified into 2 groups according to chorionicity. The rates of fetal aneuploidy in different groups were compared.\nThis study included 1,714 fetuses (857 sets of twin pairs); among them, 1,190 were DCT and 524 were MCT. Overall, the rate of aneuploidy was 4.7% (56/1,190) in DCT and 3.4% (18/524) in MCT. Sixty-four (86.5%, 64/74) fetal aneuploidies occurred in only one fetus of the twin pairs. In DCT, the most common aneuploidy was trisomy 21 (53.6%, 30/56), followed by trisomy 18 (21.4%, 12/56) and trisomy 13 (8.9%, 5/56), while in MCT, the most common aneuploidy was Turner syndrome (33.3%, 6/18), followed by trisomy 21 (27.7%, 5/18) and 47,XYY (11.0%, 2/18).\nAneuploidy mostly occurred in only one fetus in the twin pairs. The most common aneuploidy was trisomy 21 in DCT and Turner syndrome in MCT. Dual amniocentesis should be performed when discordant monozygotic twins are suspected.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins share the same STR profile, demonstrating a practical problem in forensic casework. DNA methylation has provided a suitable resource for MZ twin differentiation; however, studies addressing the forensic feasibility are lacking. Here, we investigated epigenetic MZ twin differentiation from blood under the forensic scenario comprising i) the discovery of candidate markers in reference-type blood DNA via genome-wide analysis, ii) the technical validation of candidate markers in reference-type blood DNA using a suitable targeted method, and iii) the analysis of the validated markers in trace-type DNA. Genome-wide methylation analysis in blood DNA from 10 MZ twin pairs resulted in 19-111 twin-differentially methylated sites (tDMSs) per pair with >0.3 twin-to-twin differences. Considering all top three candidate tDMSs across all pairs in the technical validation based on methylation-specific qPCR, 67.85% generated >0.1 twin-to-twin differences. Of the validated tDMSs, 68.4% showed >0.1 twin-to-twin differences with qPCR in trace-type DNA across 8 pairs. Using an updated marker selection strategy, 8 additional candidate tDMSs were obtained for an example MZ pair, of which 7 showed >0.1 twin-to-twin differences in both reference- and trace-type DNA. Lastly, we introduce a high-resolution melting curve analysis of the entire fragment that can complement the proposed approach. Overall, our study demonstrates the general feasibility of epigenetic twin differentiation in the forensic context and highlights that the number of informative tDMSs in the final trace DNA analysis is crucial, as some candidate markers identified in reference DNA were shown not informative in the trace DNA due to various, including technical, reasons. Future studies will need to address the optimal number of epigenetic markers required for reliable identification of MZ twin individuals including statistical considerations.",

    "abstract": "Young children's behavioral control predicts a broad range of developmental outcomes in child- and adulthood. It is therefore important to study how individual differences in behavioral control arise. Previous studies suggest that there are both genetic and environmental influences, which were estimated in the current study using a sample of mono- and dizygotic same-sex twins. Furthermore, we examined the associations between indicators of a stressful family environment like household chaos, parenting daily hassles, and parental depressive symptoms and children's behavioral control in 2 samples. Children of the same twin pair were randomly divided over 2 samples; a test (N = 201, 48.3% boys, M age 46.53 months) and replication sample (N = 201, 49.8% boys, M age 46.06 months). Both parents reported on their children's effortful control via the Child Behavior Questionnaire and children's cheating behavior was observed during a throwing game. We found that AE models fitted the data for effortful control (A = 31%, E = 69%) and cheating (A = 16%, E = 84%) best. Path analyses revealed that children of parents experiencing more parenting daily hassles and depressive symptoms had lower levels of effortful control in the test sample. Furthermore, we found that children growing up in more chaotic households (parent report) had an increased risk of being in the cheating group versus the possible intention to cheat group in the test sample. These results were partially replicated. We suggest that the role of stressful family environments in the development of behavioral control should be considered when setting up prevention and intervention programs targeting children's behavioral control.

    "abstract": "Increased telomerase expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung cancer and, since the primary cause of lung cancer is smoking, an association between telomerase reactivation and tobacco smoke has been proposed. In this work an investigation has been performed to assess the relationship between tobacco smoke exposure and telomerase activity (TA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy smokers. The methylation status of the catalytic subunit of telomerase hTERT was concurrently investigated to assess the possible association between epigenetic modifications of hTERT and TA. Besides, the association between smoke and telomere length (TL) has been evaluated. Healthy monozygotic twins with discordant smoking habits were selected as study population to minimize inter-individual differences because of demographic characteristics and genetic heterogeneity. Statistically significant higher values of TA and TL were observed in smokers compared to nonsmoker co-twins. The multivariate analysis of data showed, besides smoking habits (P\u2009=\u20090.02), an influence of gender (P\u2009=\u20090.006) and BMI (P\u2009=\u20090.001) on TA and a borderline effect of gender (P\u2009=\u20090.05) on TL. DNA methylation analysis, focused on 100 CpG sites mapping in hTERT, highlighted nine CpG sites differentially methylated in smokers. When co-twins were contrasted, selecting as variables the intra-twin difference in TA and hTERT DNA methylation, a statistically significant inverse correlation (P\u2009=\u20090.003) was observed between TA and DNA methylation at the cg05521538 site. In conclusion, these results indicate an association of tobacco smoke with TA and TL and suggest a possible association between smoke-induced epigenetic effects and TA in healthy smokers. Environ.

    "abstract": "Twins play an important role in the deformation of nanocrystalline (NC) metals. The size effects of {[Formula: see text]} tensile/{[Formula: see text]} compressive lamellar twins on the tensile strength and deformation mechanisms of NC hcp cobalt have been investigated by a series of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Unlike the size effects of twins on the strength for polycrystalline fcc metals, the strength of NC hcp cobalt with lamellar tensile/compressive twins monotonically increases with decreasing twin boundary spacing (TBS) and no softening stage is observed, which is due to the consistent deformation mechanisms no matter TBS is large or small. These consistent deformation mechanisms can be categorized into four types of strengthening mechanisms: (i) Partial basal dislocations nucleated from grain boundaries (GBs) or twin boundaries (TBs) intersecting with TBs/GBs; (ii) Phase transformation from hcp to fcc; (iii) <c\u2009+\u2009a> partial edge dislocations nucleated from TBs intersecting with basal partial dislocations; (iv) Growth of the newly formed secondary tensile twins inside the primary compressive/tensile twins. The observed multiple twinning in MD simulations has also been confirmed by TEM after tensile testing in NC cobalt processed by severe plastic deformation.",

    "abstract": "Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hyperpyrexia, anhidrosis, pain insensitivity, self-inflicted injuries, and intellectual disability. The anesthetic management of these patients is challenging owing to the high risk of perioperative complications resulting from their autonomic dysfunction, such as hyperthermia, hypotension, and bradycardia, which result from autonomic nervous system dysfunction.\nTwo 3-year-old Han Chinese identical male twins (weighing 13.5 kg and measuring 93 cm tall) were previously diagnosed as having congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis based on clinical features and genetic screening. According to the presence of loud snoring and heavy breathing during sleep and neck radiograph findings, they were diagnosed as having tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy and needed adenotonsillectomy. Because of innate analgesia, some reports suggested that patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis do not require perioperative pain control. Accordingly, our patients did not receive opiates. We describe the general anesthetic management of these patients using sevoflurane and propofol, but without opiates, for adenotonsillectomy. Remarkable tachycardia and hypertension occurred during airway manipulation and when the surgical stimuli increased, and their temperatures increased from 36 \u00b0C and 36.8 \u00b0C to 37.8 \u00b0C and 38.5 \u00b0C, respectively. Patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis lack pain sensation, but they may have tactile hyperesthesia. Surgical noxious stimuli may therefore produce a stress response and unpleasant sensations, leading to hemodynamic fluctuation and temperature increase.\nOn the basis of these findings, we suggest that careful intraoperative opiate titration may be justified to blunt the surgical stress response and promote hemodynamic and temperature stability in similar patients; we also recommend the preparation of warming and cooling devices and continuous temperature monitoring in these patients. Since anesthetic management of these patients is not simple, careful attention is required.",

    "abstract": "Preterm twins have a higher morbidity rate of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) than do singletons. However, the effect of multiple births on maturation of the ductus arteriosus (DA) has not been reported. Because intimal thickening (IT) is required for DA anatomical closure, we examined IT development in the DA of preterm twins and singletons. Sheep DA tissues obtained from preterm fetuses were subjected to elastica van Gieson staining to evaluate IT. The total IT score in each DA was the sum of the IT scores obtained from six evenly divided parts of the DA, which was positively correlated with gestational ages in singletons. Total IT scores were smaller in preterm twins than in singletons, although no difference in gestational age, birth weight, or gender ratio was observed. These data suggest that IT development of the DA is attenuated in sheep preterm twins, which may affect the higher morbidity of PDA.",

    "abstract": "Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, such as soda, have been shown to play an important role in weight gain. Although soda consumption has been associated with body mass index (BMI) in many studies, it has been difficult to ascertain a true causal relationship between soda consumption and BMI for two reasons. First, findings have been based largely on observational and cross-sectional studies, with much less evidence from randomized controlled trials. Second, the reported relationships may be confounded by genetic and shared environmental factors that affect both soda consumption and BMI. In the present study, we used the twin design to better understand the relationship between soda consumption and BMI by accounting for measured and unmeasured confounds in non-experimental data. Associations from genetically informed tests in twins are considered \"quasi-causal,\" suggesting that our confidence in the causal underpinning of the association between soda consumption and BMI has been strengthened. We hypothesized that the association between soda consumption and BMI would be significant both between and within twins.\nThis was a cross sectional study of 5787 same sex adult twin pairs (18-97\u00a0years, 66% female) from the community based Washington State Twin Registry. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to investigate associations between soda consumption and BMI in the population (the phenotypic association between exposure and outcome among all twins treated as individuals) and within pairs of identical and fraternal twins (the quasi-causal association controlling for between pair genetic and environmental confounds).\nAmong all twins, there was a significant phenotypic association between soda consumption and BMI that held when controlling for age, sex, race, annual household income, and education level (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In the quasi-causal model, however, the effect of soda consumption on BMI was greatly reduced and no longer significant, with a large genetic confound in both men and women (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nAmong a large group of adult twin pairs, increased soda consumption was associated with increased BMI; however, the observed association was mediated by a genetic background common to both.",

    "abstract": "SorCS1, SorCS2 and SorCS3 belong to the Vps10p-domain family of multiligand receptors. Genetic and functional studies have linked SorCS receptors to psychiatric disorders, Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes, demonstrating critical roles in neuronal functionality and metabolic control. Surprisingly, their structural composition has so far not been studied. Here we have characterized SorCS1, SorCS2 and SorCS3 using biochemical methods and electron microscopy. We found that their purified extracellular domains co-exist in stable dimeric and monomeric populations. This was supported by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, where membrane-bound dimers were successfully pulled down from cell lysate. While dimers were virtually unbreakable, dimerization of the monomeric population was promoted through enzymatic deglycosylation. We conclude that post-translational modifications, specifically the degree and pattern of glycosylation, regulate the oligomeric state of the protein. Hence, cells may dictate ligand specificity by controlling the ratio between monomers and dimers and, therefore, regulate the multiple functions of SorCS receptors.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, we aimed to explore gender differences in infant mortality and neonatal morbidity in mixed-gender twin pairs. Data were obtained from the US National Center for Health Statistics Linked Birth-Infant Death Cohort. A total of 108,038 pairs of mixed-gender twins were included in this analysis. Among the mixed-gender twins, no significant difference in the odds of fetal mortality between male twins (1.05%) and female co-twins (1.04%). However, male twins were at increased odds of neonatal mortality (adjusted OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.37, 1.85) and overall infant mortality (adjusted OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.27, 1.61) relative to their female co-twins. Congenital abnormalities (adjusted OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.27, 1.50) were identified significantly more frequently in male than female twins. Moreover, increased odds of having low 5-minute Apgar score (<7) (adjusted OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.05, 1.26), assistant ventilation >30\u2009minutes (adjusted OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.17, 1.47), and respiratory distress syndrome (adjusted OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.26, 1.66) were identified in male twins relative to their female counterparts. The results of our study indicated that in mixed-gender twin pairs, the odds of infant mortality and neonatal morbidity were higher in male twins than their female co-twins.",

No similar studies have been conducted in the world's largest and rapidly aging Chinese population. The paper aimed to identify the specific genetic variants associated with cognitive function in middle and old-aged Chinese dizygotic twins (DZ). Cognitive function was measured on 139 pairs of DZ by Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The subjects were genotyped at 1048575 SNP positions. Regression-based mixed-effect kinship model of GWAS was conducted to test the SNPs. Gene-based analysis was performed on VEGAS2. The statistically significant genes were then subject to gene set enrichment analysis to further identify the specific biological pathways associated with cognitive function. No SNPs reached genome-wide significance although there were 13 SNPs of suggestive significance (P\u00a0<\u00a010",

    "abstract": "Negotiations are inherently dyadic. Negotiators' individual-level characteristics may not only make them perform better or worse in general, but also may make them particularly well- or poorly-suited to negotiate with a particular counterpart. The present research estimates the extent to which performance in a distributive negotiation is affected by (a) the negotiators' individual-level characteristics and (b) dyadic interaction effects that are defined by the unique pairings between the negotiators and their counterparts. Because negotiators cannot interact multiple times without carryover effects, we estimated the relative importance of these factors with a new methodology that used twin siblings as stand-ins for each other. Participants engaged in a series of 1-on-1 negotiations with counterparts while, elsewhere, their cotwins engaged in the same series of 1-on-1 negotiations with the cotwins of those counterparts. In these data, dyadic interaction effects explained more variation in negotiation economic outcomes than did individual differences, whereas individual differences explain more than twice as much of the variation in subjective negotiation outcomes than did dyadic interaction effects. These results suggest dyadic interaction effects represent an understudied area for future research, particularly with regard to the economic outcomes of negotiations. (PsycINFO Database Record",

    "abstract": "The genetic and environmental impacts on correlations between hearing and cognitive functions have not been well studied. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Hearing function was assessed by audiometric pure-tone hearing thresholds at different frequencies, including 0.5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz, 8 kHz, and 12.5 kHz, with the lower hearing thresholds indicating better hearing function. Cognitive and hearing functions were measured on 379 complete twin pairs (240 monozygotic and 139 dizygotic pairs) with a median age of 50 years (range: 40-80 years). Bivariate twin models were fitted to quantify the genetic and environmental components of the correlations between hearing and cognitive functions. The analysis showed significantly high genetic correlation between 2 kHz of hearing and cognition (r G = -1.00, 95% CI [-1.00, -0.46]) and moderate genetic correlation between 4 kHz of hearing and cognition (r G = -0.62, 95% CI [-1.00, -0.14]). We found no significant genetic correlations between low as well as high frequencies of hearing and cognition. Low to moderate common and unique environmental correlations were shown between low frequencies of hearing and cognition (-0.13 to -0.39) and the common environmental correlation between 8 kHz, one of the high frequencies of hearing, and cognition (-0.22). The middle frequencies of hearing and cognitive functions may have a shared genetic basis. Low frequencies of hearing and cognition may share similar common and unique environmental factors. At 8 kHz, the high frequency of hearing and cognition may share similar common environment. This twin study detected a significant genetic and environmental basis in the phenotype correlation between cognition and hearing, which differed across frequencies.",

    "abstract": "CDKN1C and KCNQ1OT1 are imprinted genes that might be potential regulators of placental development. This study investigated placental expressions of CDKN1C and KCNQ1OT1 in monozygotic twins with and without selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR). Seventeen sIUGR and fifteen normal monozygotic(MZ) twin pairs were examined. Placental mRNA expressions of CDKN1C and KCNQ1OT1 were detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. CDKN1C protein expression was detected by immunohistochemical assay and Western-blotting. In the sIUGR group, smaller fetuses had a smaller share of the placenta, and CDKN1C protein expression was significantly increased while KCNQ1OT1 mRNA expression was significantly decreased. The CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 mRNA ratio was lower in the larger fetus than in the smaller fetus (p < .05). In the control group, CDKN1C protein expression showed no difference between larger and smaller fetuses, while KCNQ1OT1 mRNA expression was significantly lower in the larger fetus, and the CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 mRNA ratio was higher in the larger fetus than in the smaller fetus (p < .05). Our findings showed that pathogenesis of sIUGR may be related to the co-effect of the up-regulated protein expression of CDKN1C and down-regulated mRNA expression of KCNQ1OT1 in the placenta.",

    "abstract": "We report longitudinal clinical and neurophysiological assessments in twins affected by spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with discordant phenotypes. The boy had the homozygous deletion of SMN1, a typical type 1 SMA course, and died at the age of eight months. His twin sister, asymptomatic at the time of the diagnosis in her brother, had the same genetic defect but she developed clinical and electrophysiological signs of type 2 SMA. The reduction of tendon reflexes was the first clinical sign at the age of 4 months, followed within few weeks, by a mild decrement in the amplitude of the compound motor action potentials. After the age of 9 months, she showed a sudden clinical and electrophysiological deterioration. Among molecular tests, we determined SMN2 copy number, SMN2 and Plastin 3 transcript levels in peripheral blood, and observed no relevant differences between twins.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating late-onset neurodegenerative disorder in which only a small proportion of patients carry an identifiable causative genetic lesion. Despite high heritability estimates, a genetic etiology for most sporadic ALS remains elusive. Here we report the epigenetic profiling of five monozygotic twin pairs discordant for ALS, four with classic ALS and one with the progressive muscular atrophy ALS variant, in whom previous whole genome sequencing failed to uncover a genetic basis for their disease discordance. By studying cytosine methylation patterns in peripheral blood DNA we identified thousands of large between-twin differences at individual CpGs. While the specific sites of differences were mostly idiosyncratic to a twin pair, a proportion involving GABA signalling were common to all ALS individuals. For both idiosyncratic and common sites the differences occurred within genes and pathways related to neurobiological functions or dysfunctions, some of particular relevance to ALS such as glutamate metabolism and the Golgi apparatus. All four classic ALS patients were epigenetically older than their unaffected co-twins, suggesting accelerated aging in multiple tissues in this disease. In conclusion, widespread changes in methylation patterns were found in ALS-affected co-twins, consistent with an epigenetic contribution to disease. These DNA methylation findings could be used to develop blood-based ALS biomarkers, gain insights into disease pathogenesis, and provide a reference for future large-scale ALS epigenetic studies.",

    "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that the risk of neonatal morbidity among late-preterm twins is similar to that of late-preterm singletons.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of all women with twin or singleton pregnancy who gave birth during the late-preterm period in a single tertiary center between 2008 and 2015. Neonatal outcomes of low-risk, late-preterm twins were compared with those of low-risk, late-preterm singletons. The primary outcome was the same primary composite respiratory morbidity variable that was used in the randomized controlled trial of Gyamfi-Bannerman et al on the administration of antenatal corticosteroids during the late-preterm period.\nA total of 922 singleton and 721 twin late-preterm neonates met the inclusion criteria. The rates of composite respiratory morbidity and severe composite respiratory morbidity were similar for twins and singletons (8.3% compared with 7.4%, P=.5 and 6.8% compared with 6.0%, P=.5, respectively), but were lower than the rates of the same composite respiratory morbidity variable in the randomized controlled study described previously. The odds for respiratory morbidity were similar for twins and singletons for both composite respiratory morbidity (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.48-1.12) and severe composite respiratory morbidity (adjusted OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.50-1.24).\nThe risk of respiratory morbidity among late-preterm twins is similar to that of late-preterm singletons. Still, the low absolute rates of the composite respiratory morbidity in our population suggest that administration of antenatal corticosteroids may be mostly justified among neonates born closer to 34 weeks of gestation.",

In the 28 cases in which both MC fetuses died, there was one miscarriage at 16 weeks and in the other 27 cases the separate triplet was liveborn at a median gestation of 38.2 (range, 32.2-42.1) weeks. The overall rate of miscarriage was 3.3% (2/61) and that of preterm birth (PTB) at <\u200933 weeks was 6.8% (4/59).\nIn the management of DC triplet pregnancies, ER to DC twins by intrafetal laser ablation is associated with lower rates of miscarriage or early PTB, compared with expectant management or ER by fetal intracardiac injection of potassium chloride. However, about half of the pregnancies result in the birth of one rather than two babies. Copyright \u00a9 2017 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Tooth loss is a common health concern in older adults. We aimed to estimate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to the variation in the number of teeth in middle-aged and older populations using a population-based cohort of Danish twins. The study included 5,269 Danish middle-aged or older twins who provided data on the number of teeth at baseline by structured interviews. The data were analyzed using univariate liability threshold modeling, stratified by sex and age, to estimate familial risk of tooth loss as well as estimates of heritability. In the whole cohorts, 23% of participants were edentate and 53% had retained 20 or more teeth. A statistical model including additive genetic factors and environmental factors partly shared by co-twins and partly unique to each individual twin gave the best statistical fit for the number of teeth in both age categories as well as in men and women. Overall, additive genetic factors explained 36% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23% to 49%), common environmental factors 20% (95% CI: 9% to 31%), and unique environmental factors 44% (95% CI: 40% to 48%) of the total variation of the number of teeth. This study indicates that a substantial part of the variation in tooth loss is explained by genetic as well as environmental factors shared by co-twins. Our results implied that family background importantly affects tooth loss in both the middle-aged and the older populations. Family history is thus an important factor to take into account in dental health care.",

    "abstract": "Prematurity is associated with adverse outcomes. However, there are less data regarding long-term outcomes of twins based on gestational age at delivery. Our objective was to identify the association between gestational age at delivery and long-term outcomes in twins.\nAll patients with a twin pregnancy \u226524 weeks delivered by a single Maternal Fetal Medicine practice from 2005 to 2014 were surveyed regarding pediatric outcomes at or after 2 years of life. We excluded twins with aneuploidy or major fetal anomalies. The survey was mail-based, with phone follow-up for nonresponses or for clarification. Using logistic regression analysis, we compared long-term outcomes between twins born in four gestational age groups: 24 to 27-6/7 weeks, 28 to 31-6/7 weeks, 32 to 35-6/7 weeks, and 36 weeks or later.\nSix hundred fifty-three twin deliveries met inclusion criteria and 425 (65.1%) mothers responded. Mean age at the time of survey completion was 6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4 years. Earlier gestational age was significantly associated with neonatal death (14, 2, 0, and 0% in the four groups, respectively, p\u2009<\u2009.001). Prematurity was associated with a composite of major adverse outcomes (death; cerebral palsy; necrotizing enterocolitis; chronic renal, heart, or lung disease) (14, 7, 4, and 2% in the four groups, p\u2009=\u2009.036), as well as minor adverse outcomes (learning disability; need for speech, occupational, or physical therapy) (83, 69, 54, and 38%, p\u2009<\u2009.001).\nLong-term morbidity in twin pregnancies is inversely related to gestational age at delivery. However, for twins born after 28 weeks, neonatal death and severe long-term morbidity are rare.",

    "abstract": "Primary invasive cutaneous aspergillosis is a rare fungal infection that occurs mostly in immunocompromised patients. Newborns of very low birth weight present a high risk for this type of infection due to an immaturity of the cutaneous barrier and of the immune system.\nWe describe here a case of simultaneous invasive cutaneous aspergillosis in two preterm twins.\u00a0Two male preterm bichorionic biamniotic twins (A & B) were born at a general hospital by spontaneous normal delivery at 24\u00a0weeks and 6\u00a0days of gestation. They were transferred to our hospital where they receive surfactant, antibiotics and hydrocortisone. Six days later, twin A showed greenish lesions in the umbilical region. The spectrum of antibiotic therapy was broadened and fluconazole was added. The umbilical catheters of the two twins were removed and replaced by epicutaneo-cava venous catheters and the cultures were positive for Aspergillus fumigatus. Fluconazole was replaced in both twins by liposomal amphotericin B and the incubators were changed. The serum galactomannan was also positive for both twins. At day 10, yellowish lesions appeared in the abdominal region in twin B. He died on day 18 following complications related to his prematurity. Concerning the twin A, serum galactomannan was negative on day 30; liposomal amphotericin B was stopped 1 week later, with a relay by econazole (cream). His condition improved and on day 66 he was transferred for follow-up at the general hospital where he was born.\nThe source of contamination by A. fumigatus was not identified, but other similar cases from the literature include construction work at or near the hospital, oximeter sensors, latex finger stalls, non-sterile gloves, humidifying chambers of incubators, bedding and adhesive tapes. The skin fragility of preterm newborns is an excellent potential entry point for environmental fungal infections. These cases highlight the importance of suspecting primary cutaneous aspergillosis in extremely low birth weight neonates with rapidly progressive necrotic lesions.",

    "abstract": "Societal gender inequality and a preference for male children has been shown to be detrimental to girls' health. This is despite females' innate biological advantage early in life. The negative effects of gender inequity on female health are most pronounced in resource-poor countries, where cultural norms supporting a preference for male children are strongest. However, most of what is known about gender inequality and child health comes from studies of singleton births. There is little evidence for how, or if, the disadvantages associated with gender bias and son preference extend to multiple births, a population inherently at risk for a number of health challenges. This analysis examines whether gender bias in health outcomes exists for twins. Data on live twin births from 38 Demographic and Health Surveys were compiled (n=11,528 individuals) and twins were categorized as girl/girl, girl/boy, boy/girl or girl/girl. Gender inequality was measured via the Gender Inequality Index. Multilevel logistic regression models examined associations between twin sex composition, gender inequality and eight outcomes of infant and child morbidity, mortality and mother's treatment-seeking behaviours. Twin pairs containing girls had significantly lower odds of first-year mortality. Higher country-level gender inequality was associated with higher odds of reporting diarrhoea and fever/cough, as well as an increased odds of post-neonatal mortality. Results suggest that the biological advantage for females may be stronger than son preference and gender inequality in the first year of life. Understanding these relationships has the potential to inform efforts to curb the influence of gender preference on the health of female children in resource-poor settings.",

    "abstract": "Early and frequent cannabis use are associated with an increased likelihood of major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviours. We identify associations between aspects of cannabis use, MDD, and suicidal thoughts and behaviours and examine whether such associations persist after accounting for those predisposing factors, including genetic liability and early family environment, that are shared by identical twins who are discordant for cannabis exposure. Any residual association in such identical pairs might be indicative of individual-specific pathways that might be of a causal nature.\nWe did a logistic regression analysis of cannabis use from retrospective data on same-sex male and female twin pairs drawn from 3 studies that had recruited twins from the Australian Twin Registry, 1992-93 (sample 1), 1996-2000 (sample 2), and 2005-09 (sample 3). We studied associations between early use and frequent use of cannabis and MDD, suicidal ideation (ever and persistent), and suicide plan and attempt in the full sample as well as in pairs of monozygotic and dizygotic twins that were discordant for each measure of cannabis involvement at a single timepoint. Significant monozygotic associations were further adjusted for covariates, such as early alcohol or nicotine use, early dysphoric or anhedonic mood, conduct disorder, and childhood sexual abuse. Interactions between each cannabis measure and sex, sample or study effects, and birth year category were also examined as covariates.\nIn 13\u2008986 twins (6181 monozygotic and 7805 dizygotic), cannabis use ranged from 1345 (30\u00b74%) of 4432 people in sample 1 to 2275 (69\u00b70%) of 3299 in sample 3. Mean age of first cannabis use ranged from 17\u00b79 years (SD 3\u00b73) in sample 3 to 21\u00b71 years (5\u00b72) in sample 1, and frequent use (\u2265100 times) was reported by 214 (15\u00b79%) of 1345 users in sample 1 and 499 (21\u00b79%) of 2275 in sample 3. The prevalence of suicidal ideation ranged from 1102 (24\u00b79%) of 4432 people in sample 1 to 1644 (26\u00b73%) of 6255 people in sample 2 and 865 (26\u00b72%) of 3299 people in sample 3. Prevalence of MDD ranged from 901 (20\u00b73%) people in sample 1 to 1773 (28\u00b73%) in sample 2. The monozygotic twin who used cannabis frequently was more likely to report MDD (odds ratio 1\u00b798, 95% CI 1\u00b711-3\u00b753) and suicidal ideation (2\u00b747, 1\u00b719-5\u00b710) compared with their identical twin who had used cannabis less frequently, even after adjustment for covariates. For early cannabis use, the monozygotic point estimate was not significant but could be equated to the significant dizygotic estimate, suggesting a possible association with suicidal ideation.\nThe increased likelihood of MDD and suicidal ideation in frequent cannabis users cannot be solely attributed to common predisposing factors.\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, Australian National Health and Medical Research Council.",

    "abstract": "Associations between parenting and child outcomes are often interpreted as reflecting causal, social influences. However, such associations may be confounded by genes common to children and their biological parents. To the extent that these shared genes influence behaviours in both generations, a passive genetic mechanism may explain links between them. Here we aim to quantify the relative importance of passive genetic v. social mechanisms in the intergenerational association between parent-offspring relationship quality and offspring internalizing problems in adolescence.\nWe used a Children-of-Twins (CoT) design with data from the parent-based Twin and Offspring Study of Sweden (TOSS) sample [909 adult twin pairs and their offspring; offspring mean age 15.75 (2.42) years], and the child-based Swedish Twin Study of CHild and Adolescent Development (TCHAD) sample [1120 adolescent twin pairs; mean age 13.67 (0.47) years]. A composite of parent-report measures (closeness, conflict, disagreements, expressions of affection) indexed parent-offspring relationship quality in TOSS, and offspring self-reported internalizing symptoms were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) in both samples.\nA social transmission mechanism explained the intergenerational association [r = 0.21 (0.16-0.25)] in our best-fitting model. A passive genetic transmission pathway was not found to be significant, indicating that parental genetic influences on parent-offspring relationship quality and offspring genetic influences on their internalizing problems were non-overlapping.\nThese results indicate that this intergenerational association is a product of social interactions between children and parents, within which bidirectional effects are highly plausible. Results from genetically informative studies of parenting-related effects should be used to help refine early parenting interventions aimed at reducing risk for psychopathology.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of perinatal outcomes often involves datasets with some multiple births. These are datasets mostly formed of independent observations and a limited number of clusters of size two (twins) and maybe of size three or more. This non-independence needs to be accounted for in the statistical analysis. Using simulated data based on a dataset of preterm infants we have previously investigated the performance of several approaches to the analysis of continuous outcomes in the presence of some clusters of size two. Mixed models have been developed for binomial outcomes but very little is known about their reliability when only a limited number of small clusters are present.\nUsing simulated data based on a dataset of preterm infants we investigated the performance of several approaches to the analysis of binomial outcomes in the presence of some clusters of size two. Logistic models, several methods of estimation for the logistic random intercept models and generalised estimating equations were compared.\nThe presence of even a small percentage of twins means that a logistic regression model will underestimate all parameters but a logistic random intercept model fails to estimate the correlation between siblings if the percentage of twins is too small and will provide similar estimates to logistic regression. The method which seems to provide the best balance between estimation of the standard error and the parameter for any percentage of twins is the generalised estimating equations.\nThis study has shown that the number of covariates or the level two variance do not necessarily affect the performance of the various methods used to analyse datasets containing twins but when the percentage of small clusters is too small, mixed models cannot capture the dependence between siblings.",

    "abstract": "Two cases of devastating fetal malformations associated with vanished monochorionic twins were identified upon review of pathology files. A 35-year-old G1P0 woman and 36-year-old G3P1 woman were both diagnosed with an intrauterine twin gestation via transvaginal ultrasound at 10 weeks. The spectrum of fetal anomalies ranged from omphalocele, bilateral upper extremity, and unilateral lower extremity hypoplasia, to craniofacial malformation with diaphragmatic hernia. On histopathologic examination, the placentas demonstrated vascular anastomoses between the surviving co-twin and the \"vanished\" fetal sac. We propose anastomotic placental vasculature as a contributing factor to the observed fetal malformations. Additionally, genetic or teratogenic factors may have been attributed to the demise of the first twin and the anomalies seen in the other twin. While such instances are rare, they are important to consider when counseling patients regarding outcomes associated with a monochorionic vanished twin.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins with discordant karyotypes for trisomy 13 are rare. We report a case of a spontaneously conceived pregnancy who presented with first-trimester ultrasound finding of umbilical cord cyst and increased nuchal translucency in Twin A and no abnormalities in Twin B. Amniocentesis revealed 47,XY,+13 karyotype in Twin A and 46,XY karyotype in Twin B. Selective fetal reduction was performed for Twin A. Twin B was delivered at 32 weeks gestation with normal phenotype. Peripheral blood karyotype revealed 15% mosaicism for trisomy 13 and skin fibroblast revealed 46,XY karyotype. The surviving twin will be monitored for potential complication of uniparental disomy 13 and mosaic trisomy 13. This case reinforces the need for early ultrasound and nuchal translucency measurements, especially in twin gestations.",

    "abstract": "Using a qualitative monozygotic (MZ) twin differences design we explored whether adolescent MZ twins report discordant peer relationships and, if so, whether they perceive them as causes, consequences or correlates of discordant behaviour. We gathered free-response questionnaire data from 497 families and conducted in-depth telephone interviews with 97 of them. Within this dataset n = 112 families (23% of the sample) described discordant peer relationships. Six categories of discordance were identified (peer victimisation, peer rejection, fewer friends, different friends, different attitudes to friendship and dependence on co-twin). Participants described peer relationship discordance arising as a result of chance occurrences, enhanced vulnerability in one twin or discordant behaviour. Consequences of discordant peer relationships were seen as discordance in self-confidence, future plans, social isolation, mental health and interests. In all cases the twin with worse peer experiences was seen as having a worse outcome. Specific hypotheses are presented.",

    "abstract": "Neuroticism, a 'Big Five' personality trait, has been associated with sub-clinical traits of both autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The objective of the current study was to examine whether causal overlap between ASD and ADHD traits can be accounted for by genetic and environmental risk factors that are shared with neuroticism. We performed twin-based structural equation modeling using self-report data from 12 items of the Neo Five-Factor Inventory Neuroticism domain, 11 Social Responsiveness Scale items, and 12 Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale items obtained from 3,170 young adult Australian individual twins (1,081 complete pairs). Univariate analysis for neuroticism, ASD, and ADHD traits suggested that the most parsimonious models were those with additive genetic and unique environmental components, without sex limitation effects. Heritability of neuroticism, ASD, and ADHD traits, as measured by these methods, was moderate (between 40% and 45% for each respective trait). In a trivariate model, we observed moderate phenotypic (between 0.45 and 0.62), genetic (between 0.56 and 0.71), and unique environmental correlations (between 0.37and 0.55) among neuroticism, ASD, and ADHD traits, with the highest value for the shared genetic influence between neuroticism and self-reported ASD traits (r g = 0.71). Together, our results suggest that in young adults, genetic, and unique environmental risk factors indexed by neuroticism overlap with those that are shared by ASD and ADHD.",

Taking exception to his assertion about Sir Francis Galton, I wrote a letter to the Times' editor. The letter was unpublished, but it brought a wonderful response from Sacks himself that is reproduced and examined. Next, brief reviews of twin research concerning the vanishing twin syndrome (VTS), discordant sex in a monozygotic (MZ) twin pair, and multiple pregnancy outcomes from assisted reproductive technology (ART) are presented. This section is followed by popular coverage of superfetated twins, smoking-discordant co-twins, twins in fashion, Yale University twin hockey players, and a visiting professor who was a conjoined twin.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated an association between congenital Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and microcephaly; however, to date, there have been no reports on the consequences of ZIKV infection on fetuses in twin pregnancies. Herein, we reported on the first case of a monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancy having ZIKV-related microcephaly. Our findings suggested that, in an MCDA twin pregnancy, the ZIKV may cause infection in both fetuses, resulting in severe abnormalities in the central nervous system due to neural cell destruction and the disruption of the normal development processes of the brain. This case report and other similar twin cases may help to understand the pathogenesis and to confirm the etiology of ZIKV as a teratogenic microorganism.",

Although Pierre Robin syndrome is well described in literature, only a few have mentioned its occurrence in identical twins.

Although it is a rare coincidence, Pierre Robin syndrome still can occur in identical twin babies.

    "abstract": "Craniopagus is a very rare congenital anomaly that tends to affect females more often than males. It is classified as partial or total. Most affected twins are either stillborn or die during the perinatal period. Those who survive birth should undergo detailed radiological evaluations soon after their condition becomes stable so that the precise anatomy of the conjoined part can be defined and surgery can be planned in detail by a multidisciplinary team. Recommendations for decreasing the risk of unsuccessful surgery include performing surgery on an elective basis after extensive preoperative radiological evaluations as well as when the twins are at an acceptable age and weight for a complex surgical separation, generally as staged procedures. In addition, the operation should be performed by a well-equipped expert multidisciplinary team. When one of the conjoined twins dies, however, surgical separation cannot be postponed because the shared circulatory system predisposes the alive child to life-threatening complications, including coagulopathy. The authors report on the successful separation of craniopagus twins performed on an emergency basis at 32 weeks of gestational age because of the sudden death of one of them. At the time of separation surgery, the twins each weighed 1250 g. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the youngest age and lowest weight yet reported for successful surgical separation. The surviving twin developed a pseudomeningocele, which required a second operation and placement of a cystoperitoneal shunt 4 months after the operation. Additional surgery is planned to repair a cranial defect that resulted from the pseudomeningocele, but his general physical and mental condition was otherwise good at latest follow-up (12 months after separation surgery).",

By means of A/C/E structural equation modeling, it was found that the gray matter volume in children and adolescents was jointly affected by genetic (A: 0.89) and environmental factors while genetic factors play a greater role. The gray matter volume in frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe and lateral temporal lobe was mainly affected by genetics (A: 0.7-0.89), where as the gray matter volume in medial temporal lobe and cingulate cortex was affected by both genetics and environment.",

    "abstract": "Massive perivillous fibrinoid deposition (MFD) and maternal floor infarction (MFI) are lesions of unknown etiology associated with poor perinatal outcomes, including fetal intrauterine growth restriction and neurodevelopmental injury, high risks of pregnancy loss, and recurrence in subsequent gestations. MFI comprises massive intervillous fibrinoid deposition concentrated at the maternal floor. MFD is a similar lesion but is diffuse within the parenchyma. MFD/MFI lesions represent a spectrum of severity of cloak-like perivillous fibrinoid deposition, and there is mounting evidence that, often, they represent sequelae of immune-mediated phenomena and/or an imbalance in factors that normally maintain the fluidity of blood in the maternal space. There are only a handful of reported instances of discordant MFD/MFI occurrence in twin placentas. We present a fourth such occurrence in a fused, dichorionic diamniotic twin placenta and submit that our dizygotic twin gestation case provides additional supportive evidence that immune-mediated mechanisms are involved in the formation of pathological accumulations of fibrinoid, at least in some cases.",

In this report, we share an interesting case of a pair of monozygotic twins: one of them developed PPB when she was 4-year old, while the other developed acute transient hepatitis when she was 5-year old. Next-Gen sequencing for DICER1 mutations of their family revealed that both twins and their mother had c.C3675A mutation. The mother also had a history of multinodular goiter. Identification of DICER1 mutation carriers and close surveillance of individuals at risk for DICER1 syndrome may allow early detection and hence better outcome.",

Our rare case demonstrates striking similarities in both the timing and type of clinical manifestation, as well as in the underlying anatomy and the distribution of coronary artery disease. When premature coronary artery disease is found in one of a monozygotic twin pair, evaluating the other twin is a reasonable approach.",

    "abstract": "Single fetal death in a monochorionic twin pregnancy is more frequent than in a dichorionic twin gestation. Due to inter-twin vascular anastomosis in the monochorionic common placenta, the death of one twin causes a drop in blood pressure due to a shift of blood from the survivor to the dead fetus. If the drop of blood pressure is abrupt and serious, the survivor will die soon after (as occurs in 15% of cases). If the drop is less serious, the survivor may sustain ischemic injury (in about 26% of the cases) and if the drop in blood pressure is subtle, the survivor will be intact. Thus, 30% of survivors will sustain serious, mainly brain, injury - a significantly higher incidence than was previously reported. The diagnosis of single fetal demise in a monochorionic twin pregnancy is usually reached at an unknown interval from the co-twin's death and hence, damage has already occurred and there is no need for an untimely delivery of the survivor.",

    "abstract": "Contraction twinning in magnesium alloys leads to new grains that are misoriented from the parent grain by a rotation (56\u00b0, a). The classical shear theory of deformation twinning does not specify the atomic displacements and does not explain why contraction twinning is less frequent than extension twinning. The paper proposes a new displacive model in line with our previous work on martensitic transformations and extension twinning. A continuous angular distortion matrix that transforms the initial hexagonal close-packed (h.c.p.) crystal into a final h.c.p. crystal is determined such that the atoms move as hard spheres and reach the final positions expected by the orientation relationship. The calculations prove that the distortion is not a simple shear when it is considered in its continuity. The ({0{\\overline 1}1}) plane is untilted and restored, but it is not fully invariant because some interatomic distances in this plane evolve during the distortion process; the unit volume also increases up to 5% before coming back to its initial value when the twinning distortion is complete. Then, the distortion takes the form of a simple shear on the ({0{\\overline 1}1}) plane with a shear along the direction [{18,{\\overline 5},{\\overline 5}}] of amplitude 0.358. Experiments are proposed to validate or disprove the model.",

    "abstract": "We used quantitative genetic methods to evaluate whether sleep quality, pain, and depression symptoms share a common genetic diathesis, to estimate the genetic and environmental sources of covariance among these symptoms, and to test for possible causal relationships.\nA community sample of 400 twins from the University of Washington Twin Registry completed standardized self-report questionnaires. We used biometric modeling to assess genetic and environmental contribution to the association between sleep quality measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, pain measured by the Brief Pain Inventory, and depression symptoms measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory. Trivariate Cholesky structural equation models were used to decompose correlations among the phenotypes.\nHeritability was estimated at 37% (95% confidence interval = 20%-51%) for sleep quality, 25% (9%-41%) for pain, and 39% (22%-53%) for depression. Nonshared environmental influences accounted for the remaining variance. The genetic correlation between sleep quality and pain had an rg value of .69 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.33-0.97), rg value of .56 (95% CI = 0.55-0.98) between pain and depression, and rg value of .61 (95% CI = 0.44-0.88) between depression and sleep quality. Nonshared environmental overlap was present between pain and sleep quality as well as depression and sleep quality.\nThe link between sleep quality, pain, and depression was primarily explained by shared genetic influences. The genetic factors influencing sleep quality and pain were highly correlated even when accounting for depression. Findings support the hypothesis of a genetic link between depression and pain as well as potential causality for the association of sleep quality with pain and depression.",

    "abstract": "In France, an addictovigilance network is responsible for evaluating drug dependence, by drawing on pharmacoepidemiological studies, clinical studies and by assessing healthcare professionals' reports on problematic consumption.\nThe aim of this study was to determine whether zolpidem and zopiclone have different dependence profiles, based on healthcare professionals' reports, and to identify various consumer dependence profiles among zolpidem users and among zopiclone users. Dependence in reports was assessed using the EGAP scale; a scale developed using the DSM diagnostic dependence criteria.\nThe comparison of dependence profiles for zolpidem and zopiclone showed differences both in total EGAP score and EGAP item positivity. The descriptive analysis showed that EGAP scores were higher for zolpidem than for zopiclone, suggesting more severe problematic consumption with zolpidem. For zolpidem 2 subpopulations of consumers were identified, with one subpopulation's consumption being more severe than the other, with a significantly higher total EGAP score and more harmful consequences. No subpopulation was highlighted for zopiclone.\nThese results were in favour of a higher prevalence of physical and compulsive signs of dependence and of harmful consequences of dependence, with zolpidem than with zopiclone.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a common disorder with a high heritability, but its genetic architecture is still elusive. We implemented whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of 8 families with monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia to assess potential association of de novo mutations (DNMs) or inherited variants with susceptibility to schizophrenia. Eight non-synonymous DNMs (including one splicing site) were identified and shared by twins, which were either located in previously reported schizophrenia risk genes (p.V24689I mutation in TTN, p.S2506T mutation in GCN1L1, IVS3+1G\u00a0>\u00a0T in DOCK1) or had a benign to damaging effect according to in silico prediction analysis. By searching the inherited rare damaging or loss-of-function (LOF) variants and common susceptible alleles from three classes of schizophrenia candidate genes, we were able to distill genetic alterations in several schizophrenia risk genes, including GAD1, PLXNA2, RELN and FEZ1. Four inherited copy number variations (CNVs; including a large deletion at 16p13.11) implicated for schizophrenia were identified in four families, respectively. Most of families carried both missense DNMs and inherited risk variants, which might suggest that DNMs, inherited rare damaging variants and common risk alleles together conferred to schizophrenia susceptibility. Our results support that schizophrenia is caused by a combination of multiple genetic factors, with each DNM/variant showing a relatively small effect size.",

    "abstract": "Resting heart rate (RHR) possibly has a hereditary component and is associated with longevity. We used the classical biometric twin study design to investigate the heritability of RHR in a population of middle-aged and elderly twins and, furthermore, studied the association between RHR and mortality.\nIn total, 4282 twins without cardiovascular disease were included from the Danish Twin Registry, hereof 1233 twin pairs and 1816 'single twins' (twins with a non-participating co-twin); mean age 61.7 (SD 11.1) years; 1334 (31.2%) twins died during median 16.3 (IQR 13.8-16.5) years of follow-up assessed through Danish national registers. RHR was assessed by palpating radial pulse.\nWithin pair correlations for RHR adjusted for sex and age were 0.23 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.32) and 0.10 (0.03 to 0.17) for RHR in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, respectively. Overall, heritability estimates were 0.23 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.30); 0.27 (0.15 to 0.38) for males and 0.17 (0.06 to 0.28) for females. In multivariable models adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, pulmonary function, smoking, physical activity and zygosity, RHR was significantly associated with mortality (eg, RHR >90\u2009vs 61-70 beats per min: all-cause HR 1.56 (95% CI 1.21 to 2.03); cardiovascular 2.19 (1.30 to 3.67). Intrapair twin comparison revealed that the twin with the higher RHR was significantly more likely to die first and the probability increased with increase in intrapair difference in RHR.\nRHR is a trait with a genetic influence in middle-aged and elderly twins free of cardiovascular disease. RHR is independently associated with longevity even when familial factors are controlled for in a twin design.",

    "abstract": "In different pathophysiological conditions plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) plasma concentrations are elevated. As dietary patterns are considered to influence PAI-1 concentration, we aimed to determine active PAI-1 plasma concentrations and mRNA expression in adipose tissue before and after consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) and the impact of additive genetic effects herein in humans. For 6 weeks, 46 healthy, non-obese pairs of twins (aged 18-70) received a normal nutritionally balanced diet (ND) followed by an isocaloric HFD for 6 weeks. Active PAI-1 plasma levels and PAI-1 mRNA expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue were assessed after the ND and after 1 and 6 weeks of HFD. Active PAI-1 plasma concentrations and PAI-1 mRNA expression in adipose tissue were significantly increased after both 1 and 6 weeks of HFD when compared to concentrations determined after ND (p < .05), with increases of active PAI-1 being independent of gender, age, or changes of BMI and intrahepatic fat content, respectively. However, analysis of covariance suggests that serum insulin concentration significantly affected the increase of active PAI-1 plasma concentrations. Furthermore, the increase of active PAI-1 plasma concentrations after 6 weeks of HFD was highly heritable (47%). In contrast, changes in PAI-1 mRNA expression in fatty tissue in response to HFD showed no heritability and were independent of all tested covariates. In summary, our data suggest that even an isocaloric exchange of macronutrients - for example, a switch to a fat-rich diet - affects PAI-1 concentrations in humans and that this is highly heritable.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the associations between night work, sleep and disability pension (DP) due to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), while controlling for several confounding factors including both genetic factors and shared family background.\nThe study sample consisted of 27 165 Swedish twin individuals born in 1935-58 with comprehensive survey data on sociodemographic, health and lifestyle factors. Night work was assessed as years of working hours at night at least every now and then, and categorized into 'not at all, 1-10 years and over 10 years'. Data on DP with MSD (ICD-diagnoses M00-M99) were obtained from the National Social Insurance Agency. Follow-up was from the time of the interview in 1998-2003 until 2013. Information on the length and quality of sleep was available for a sub-sample of twins (n = 1684). Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nDuring the follow-up, 1338 (5%) participants were granted DP due to MSD. Both 1-10 years (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.17-1.53) and over 10 years of night work (HR 1.39 95% CI 1.18-1.64) increased the risk of future DP. The associations were not affected by health, lifestyle or sleep factors. In the discordant twin pair analysis, the associations between night work and DP due to MSD attenuated.\nNight work was associated with increased risk of DP due to MSD independently from health and lifestyle factors. Familial confounding could not be ruled out.",

    "abstract": "We describe monozygotic twin girls with genetic variation at two separate loci resulting in a blended phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome and Pitt-Hopkins syndrome. These girls were diagnosed in early infancy with Prader-Willi syndrome, but developed an atypical phenotype, with apparent intellectual deficiency and lack of obesity. Array-comparative genomic hybridization confirmed a de novo paternal deletion of the 15q11.2q13 region and exome sequencing identified a second mutational event in both girls, which was a novel variant c.145+1G>A affecting a TCF4 canonical splicing site inherited from the mosaic mother. RNA studies showed that the variant abolished the donor splicing site, which was accompanied by activation of an alternative non-canonical splicing-site which then predicts a premature stop codon in the following exon. Clinical re-evaluation of the twins indicated that both variants are likely contributing to the more severe phenotypic presentation. Our data show that atypical clinical presentations may actually be the expression of blended clinical phenotypes arising from independent pathogenic events at two loci.",

    "abstract": "The current systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate the perinatal outcomes in twin pregnancies following multifetal pregnancy reduction (MPR) compared with non-reduced triplet pregnancies. All studies comparing perinatal outcome of twin pregnancies following MPR to non-reduced triplet pregnancies were considered. MEDLINE, non-indexed MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science were searched for relevant published articles up to August 2016. The search yielded 653 publications of which 92 were assessed for eligibility. A total of 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the outcomes of pregnancies following MPR were better compared with expectantly managed triplets. The MPR group delivered at a later gestational age and was less likely to be delivered before 32 or 28 weeks' gestation. Newborns in the MPR group had significantly higher birthweight at delivery (mean difference 500\u2009g [95% CI 439.95, 560.04]). Rates of pregnancy loss before 24 weeks' gestation and overall infant survival were comparable between the groups. This meta-analysis suggests that MPR of triplet pregnancies to twins is associated with improved perinatal outcome compared with non-reduced triplets. Should primary prevention of high order multiple pregnancy fail, MPR is an appropriate alternative to minimize the perinatal morbidity and mortality of triplet pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the association between first-trimester inter- and intrafetal size discrepancies and pregnancy outcome, among bichorionic-biamniotic twins conceived by IVF.\nA retrospective study design was used.\nTertiary university-affiliated medical center.\nAll women with a viable first-trimester bichorionic-biamniotic twin gestation, who conceived after IVF in 2007-2015.\nNone.\nThe association between fetal size differences and pregnancy outcome was analyzed. Intrafetal size discordance was defined as a difference between the actual gestational age calculated by ovum pickup (OPU) date and the evaluated gestational age by crown-rump length (CRL), for each twin. Intertwin size discrepancy was defined as a difference in CRL between the twins. The primary outcome was the number of live-born fetuses; the secondary outcome measures were gestational age at birth, birth weight percentile, and birth weight discordancy.\nA total of 277 women met the study criteria and were divided into three groups by outcome: 218 (78.7%) live-born twins, 41 (14.8%) live-born singleton, and 19 (6.5%) non-live-born pregnancy. Among the smaller than expected twin, the association of CRL-OPU differences with the primary outcome was significant for twin live-born delivery (-1.43\u00a0day), singleton live-born delivery (-4.12\u00a0days), and non-live-born pregnancy (-6.72\u00a0days). For the relatively larger twin, the association was significant for non-live-born pregnancy (-4.33\u00a0days) compared with any live-born delivery, either singleton (-0.95\u00a0days) or twin (-0.21\u00a0days).\nAmong IVF conceived twin gestations, a CRL-OPU gap was associated with an increased risk of a negative pregnancy outcome.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twinning is an embryological anomaly rarely reported in wild mammals and with only two previous records in Chiroptera. Here, we report a case of dicephalic parapagus conjoined twins in the Neotropical phyllostomid genus Artibeus. These twins are males and present separated heads and necks, but a conjoined trunk with an expanded upper thoracic region. They developed two complete forelimbs and two complete hindlimbs, all laterally to the trunk. There is a volume in the upper midback and between the heads that resembles a third rudimentary medial forelimb, but X-ray images only suggest the presence of medial skeletal elements of the pectoral girdle (clavicle and scapulae) in this region. The X-ray images also show that vertebral columns run separated from head until the base of lumbar region, where they form a single structure. Using ultrasound images, we detected the presence of two similarly sized and apparently separated hearts. The accumulation of study cases like this will help in the understanding of patterns and process behind this phenomena, and collection material plays a key role in this context.",

Although both entities are in a spectrum of ventral body wall defects, the combination of PC and OEIS complex has not been described.\nIn this report, we describe an unusual case of congenital ventral body wall defect with combined features of PC and OEIS complex, which discordantly occurred in monochorionic monoamniotic twins.\nPC and OEIS complex may be related regarding their embryologic origins. The combination may represent the most severe manifestation of ventral body wall defects.",

    "abstract": "The study of identical twins can point out potential limitations in biometrics and forensic odontology. This case report presents three-dimensional (3D) palatal rugae analysis in monozygotic twins utilizing digital models obtained directly by scanning the maxillary dental arch with the iTero\u00ae intraoral digital scanner. The results show that the rugae patterns contain related but not identical features between the pair of identical twins. Dental study models taken on a regular basis for diagnosis and treatment planning in dentistry include the palatal rugae, which could be valuable to forensics in identical twin identification cases.",

    "abstract": "Cryptorchidism represents one of the most common human congenital anomalies. In most cases, its etiology remains unclear and seems to be multifactorial. In the present study, a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for cryptorchidism was identified. Twin zygosity was confirmed by microsatellite genotyping. Whole exome sequencing and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-Seq) of DNA extract from leucocytes were performed to, respectively, evaluate their exomes and epigenomes. No differences in exome sequencing data were found between the twins after validation. MeDIP-Seq analysis detected 5,410 differentially hypermethylated genes and 2,383 differentially hypomethylated genes. Bioinformatic analysis showed that these genes belonged to several biological processes and signaling pathways, including regulation of actin cytoskeleton, which has been previously implicated in the etiology of cryptorchidism. The findings of the present study suggest that non-genetic factors might contribute to the pathogenesis of cryptorchidism.",

    "abstract": "Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is known to occur in families. The reported overall incidence of familial cases is 7.6%, with a higher incidence of 15-21% in total colonic aganglionosis and 50% in the rare total intestinal aganglionosis. HSCR is extremely rare in twins. The aim of this study was to systematically analyse the patterns of HSCR in twins published in the literature.\nElectronic databases Pubmed and Medline were screened for relevant articles using the keywords \"Hirschsprung's disease\", \"aganglionosis\", \"twins\", \"monozygotic\", and \"dizygotic\". Examining reference lists identified further relevant papers.\nTwelve studies with a total of 18 twin pairs were included in this analysis. 67% twins were discordant. HSCR was found in 24 out of 36 twin subjects (67%), of which 83% affected were male. Rectosigmoid type was reported in 71% of patients, long-segment disease in 21, and 8% presented with a total aganglionosis. Three twin pairs had at least one family member affected with HSCR.\nHSCR was found in two-thirds of twin subjects with a male predominance. Rectosigmoid aganglionosis was the most common variant. Disease discordance was identified, where environmental insults were postulated to be predisposing factors to disease expression. Future studies investigating the disease-associated mutations in the already identified HSCR genes should provide insights into the genetic basis of HSCR in twins.",

    "abstract": "The choice of a growth curve determines the screening for small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses and little data is available on SGA twins. Our aim was to evaluate small-for-gestational-age (SGA) detection rate in twin pregnancies and assess whether the use of a customized curve allowed better identification of SGA fetuses.\nRetrospective study including all twins between 2010 and 2013. Two groups were formed: the SGA and the non-SGA group. Four curves were compared: Hadlock's curve, a customized curve, EPOP\u00e9 M0 and EPOP\u00e9 M1. We defined a composite neonatal complication criterion (transfer to intensive care unit, respiratory distress and death).\n472 fetuses were included with a 34.3% prevalence of SGA. Hadlock's curve showed better sensitivity for the detection of SGA <10th percentile (67.3% vs. 63%, 59.9% and 57.4% respectively). Diagnostic Odd Ratio were comparable for the detection of SGA. For the composite variable, there was a significant difference between the 2 groups using a customized curve adjusted for fetal sex (EPOP\u00e9 M1).\nThe EPOP\u00e9 (M0 and M1) and customized curves do not improve screening for SGA infants below the 10th percentile. The reduced effectiveness of customized curves can be related to the greater impact of placentation or cord insertion on the potential for fetal growth.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we use new data on Danish monozygotic (MZ) twins to analyze the effect of cultural capital on educational success. We report three main findings. First, cultural capital has a positive direct effect on the likelihood of completing the college-bound track in Danish secondary education. Second, cultural capital leads teachers to form upwardly biased perceptions of children's academic ability, but only when their exposure to children's cultural capital is brief (as in oral and written exams) rather than long (as in grades awarded at the end of the school year). Third, we find that the positive direct effect of cultural capital on educational success is higher for children from high-socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds than for those from low-SES backgrounds. This result suggests that high-SES children are more likely to be in schooling contexts that enable them to convert cultural capital into educational success.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to compare the placental weight and birth weight/placental weight ratio for intrauterine growth-restricted and non-intrauterine growth-restricted monochorionic and dichorionic twins.\nThis was a retrospective analysis of placentas from twin pregnancies. Placental weight and the birth weight/placental weight ratio were compared in intrauterine growth-restricted and non-intrauterine growth-restricted monochorionic and dichorionic twins. The association between cord insertion type and placental lesions in intrauterine growth-restricted and non-intrauterine growth-restricted monochorionic and dichorionic twins was also investigated.\nA total of 105 monochorionic (intrauterine growth restriction=40; non-intrauterine growth restriction=65) and 219 dichorionic (intrauterine growth restriction=57; non-intrauterine growth restriction=162) placentas were analyzed. A significantly lower placental weight was observed in intrauterine growth-restricted monochorionic (p=0.022) and dichorionic (p<0.001) twins compared to non-intrauterine growth-restricted twins. There was no difference in the birth weight/placental weight ratio between the intrauterine growth restriction and non-intrauterine growth restriction groups for either monochorionic (p=0.36) or dichorionic (p=0.68) twins. Placental weight and the birth weight/placental weight ratio were not associated with cord insertion type or with placental lesions.\nLow placental weight, and consequently reduced functional mass, appears to be involved in fetal growth restriction in monochorionic and dichorionic twins. The mechanism by which low placental weight influences the birth weight/placental weight ratio in intrauterine growth-restricted monochorionic and dichorionic twins needs to be determined in larger prospective studies.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease resulting from the trans-placental passage of maternal anti-SSA/Ro, anti-SSB/La, and less frequently anti-RNP antibodies to the foetus. At the time of diagnosis 50% of mothers are asymptomatic. Neonatal manifestations of this multisystem disease may include congenital heart block, cutaneous lesions and haematological abnormalities. We present the case of congenital neonatal lupus erythematosus in non-identical twins, showing variability in clinical manifestation of this disease,despite receiving the same level of antibodies from the mother. This case adds to the growing body of evidence about the role of genetics and other feto-maternal contributing factors in addition to the presence of auto antibodies. It raises interesting questions about discordant disease expression in offspring's of the same mother.",

    "abstract": "Twenty-eight-week-old preterm monochorionic-diamniotic twins were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit secondary to low birth weight and mild respiratory distress syndrome. A low fibrinogen level of less than 0.5\u2009g/L was detected following an abnormal full blood count. They required fibrinogen transfusions until 32 weeks corrected gestation to maintain adequate fibrinogen levels. Parental screening revealed that their mother had a previously undiagnosed hypofibrinogenaemia. Of note, her only symptom was menorrhagia. This may have implications on further pregnancies as it can be associated with spontaneous miscarriage and post-partum haemorrhage. Congenital hypofibrinogenaemia is a rare disorder and there are no reported cases from Ireland. A higher degree of suspicion for screening is required to detect new cases and demonstrates the benefits of checking parental levels in such situations.",

    "abstract": "Previous research shows that, besides risk factors in adult life, the early-life environment can influence blood pressure and hypertension in adults. However, the effects of residential traffic exposure and residential greenness in the early-life on blood pressure in young adulthood are currently unknown.\nAmbulatory (24-h) blood pressures of 278 twins (132 pairs) of the East Flanders Prospective Twins Study were obtained at the age of 18 to 25\u00a0years. Prenatal and adulthood residential addresses were geocoded and used to assign prenatal and postnatal traffic and greenness indicators. Mixed modelling was performed to investigate blood pressure in association with greenness while adjusting for potential confounding factors.\nNight-time systolic blood pressure was inversely associated with greenness at the residential address in twins living at the same address their entire life (non-movers, n\u00a0=\u00a097, 34.9%). An interquartile increase in residential greenness exposure (1000\u00a0m radius) was associated with a 3.59\u00a0mmHg (95% CI: -6.0 to -1.23; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) lower adult night systolic blood pressure. Among twins who were living at a different address than their birth address at time of the measurement (n\u00a0=\u00a0181, 65.1%), night-time blood pressure was inversely associated with residential surrounding greenness at adult age as well as with residential greenness in early-life. However after additional adjustment for residential greenness exposure in adulthood, only residential greenness exposure in early-life was significantly associated with night systolic blood pressure. While no significant effect of adult residential greenness with adult blood pressure was observed, while accounting for the early-life greenness exposure.\nLower residential greenness in the early-life environment was independently associated with a higher adult blood pressure. This indicates that residential greenness has persistent effects on blood pressure.",

    "abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa has the world's highest under-5 and neonatal mortality rates as well as the highest naturally occurring twin rates. Twin pregnancies carry high risk for children and mothers. Under-5 mortality has declined in sub-Saharan Africa over the last decades. It is unknown whether twins have shared in this reduction.\nWe pooled data from 90 Demographic and Health Surveys for 30 sub-Saharan Africa countries on births reported between 1995 and 2014. We used information on 1\u2008685\u2008110 singleton and 56\u2008597 twin livebirths to compute trends in mortality rates for singletons and twins. We examined whether the twin-singleton rate ratio can be attributed to biological, socioeconomic, care-related factors, or birth size, and estimated the mortality burden among sub-Saharan African twins.\nUnder-5 mortality among twins has declined from 327\u00b77 (95% CI 312\u00b70-343\u00b75) per 1000 livebirths in 1995-2001 to 213\u00b70 (196\u00b77-229\u00b72) in 2009-14. This decline of 35\u00b70% was much less steep than the 50\u00b76% reduction among singletons (from 128\u00b76 [95% CI 126\u00b74-130\u00b78] per 1000 livebirths in 1995-2001 to 63\u00b75 [61\u00b76-65\u00b73] in 2009-14). Twins account for an increasing share of under-5 deaths in sub-Saharan Africa: currently 10\u00b77% of under-5 mortality and 15\u00b71% of neonatal mortality. We estimated that about 315\u2008000 twins (uncertainty interval 289\u2008000-343\u2008000) die in sub-Saharan African each year. Excess twin mortality cannot be explained by common risk factors for under-5 mortality, including birthweight. The difference with singletons was especially stark for neonatal mortality (rate ratio 5\u00b70, 95% CI 4\u00b75-5\u00b76). 51\u00b77% of women pregnant with twins reported receiving medical assistance at birth.\nThe fate of twins in sub-Saharan Africa is lagging behind that of singletons. An alarming one-fifth of twins in the region dies before age 5 years, three times the mortality rate among singletons. Twins account for a substantial and growing share of under-5 and neonatal mortality, but they are largely neglected in the literature. Coordinated action is required to improve the situation of this extremely vulnerable group.\nNone.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that for twin pregnancies with a cephalic presenting first twin, planned vaginal delivery is not associated with adverse short-term neonatal outcomes, as compared to planned cesarean delivery. Our objective was to compare long-term outcomes in twins, based on planned mode of delivery.\nThis was a prospective, observational cohort of twin pregnancies delivered by a single MFM practice. All the patients with a twin pregnancy >34 weeks delivered from 2005-2014 were surveyed regarding pediatric outcomes at or after 2 years of life. The survey was mail-based, with phone follow-up for nonresponses or for clarification of answers. Using chi-square, Student's t-tests, and regression analysis we compared outcomes between women who planned a vaginal (with active management of the second stage) versus cesarean delivery. The main outcome measures were: (1) a composite of major adverse outcomes (death, cerebral palsy, necrotizing enterocolitis, chronic renal, heart, or lung disease); (2) a composite of minor adverse outcomes (learning disability, speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy).\nFive hundred and thirty-two women met inclusion criteria and 354 (66.5%) responded. 178 (50.3%) women planned to have a cesarean delivery (100% of whom had a cesarean delivery) and 176 (49.7%) women planned to have a vaginal delivery (83% of whom had a vaginal delivery). The average age of the children at the time of the survey was 5.9 years. There were no differences in any pediatric outcomes between the two groups. After controlling for maternal age, IVF, obesity, and preeclampsia, the planned mode of delivery was not associated with a composite of major adverse outcomes (aOR 0.673, 95% CI 0.228, 1.985), nor a composite of minor adverse outcomes (aOR 0.767, 95% CI 0.496, 1.188).\nPlanned vaginal delivery with active management of the second stage of labor in twin pregnancies >34 weeks is not associated with adverse childhood outcomes.",

    "abstract": "To identify novel genetic and epigenetic factors associated with Myasthenia gravis (MG) using an identical twins experimental study design.\nThe transcriptome and methylome of peripheral monocytes were compared between monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant and concordant for MG, as well as with MG singletons and healthy controls, all females. Sets of differentially expressed genes and differentially methylated CpGs were validated using RT-PCR for expression and target bisulfite sequencing for methylation on additional samples.\n>100 differentially expressed genes and \u223c1800 differentially methylated CpGs were detected in peripheral monocytes between MG patients and controls. Several transcripts associated with immune homeostasis and inflammation resolution were reduced in MG patients. Only a relatively few genes differed between the discordant healthy and MG co-twins, and both their expression and methylation profiles demonstrated very high similarity.\nThis is the first study to characterize the DNA methylation profile in MG, and the expression profile of immune cells in MZ twins with MG. Results suggest that numerous small changes in gene expression or methylation might together contribute to disease. Impaired monocyte function in MG and decreased expression of genes associated with inflammation resolution could contribute to the chronicity of the disease. Findings may serve as potential new predictive biomarkers for disease and disease activity, as well as potential future targets for therapy development. The high similarity between the healthy and the MG discordant twins, suggests that a molecular signature might precede a clinical phenotype, and that genetic predisposition may have a stronger contribution to disease than previously assumed.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twin pregnancies are at increased risk of complications due to sharing a single placenta and potentially developing unbalanced vascular anastomoses. Complications include twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) which affects 10-15% monochorionic twins, and if untreated has a 70-90% perinatal loss rate. We are currently unable to predict which twins will develop complications or to what severity. We have previously shown differences in angiogenic and placental growth factors in maternal blood in pregnancies complicated by TTTS compared to twin pregnancies not complicated by TTTS but matched for gestation. There is also evidence to suggest that abnormal ultrasound measurements recorded in the first trimester (nuchal translucency and crown-rump length) may be associated with severe TTTS later in pregnancy, however the detection rate is only reported as 52%. We hypothesize that if these changes precede the development of the clinical syndrome, this may increase the sensitivity and specificity of detecting adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nThis cohort study has retrospective and prospective elements. In the retrospective cohort we will measure factors (decided based on preliminary work and a systematic review and meta-analysis) in stored maternal blood samples taken in the first-trimester, extract first-trimester ultrasound measurements and match these to pregnancy outcome. The prospective cohort will be divided into a \"screening\" cohort and \"complicated\" cohort. The screening cohort will undergo serial maternal blood sampling at 12, 16 and 20 weeks; we will extract ultrasound measurements and match to pregnancy outcome. The complicated cohort will comprise of women referred to the Fetal Medicine Centre with complications of monochorionicity. If the decision is taken to undergo fetoscopic laser ablation we will take maternal blood samples and amniotic fluid samples pre- and post-laser treatment. The same factors will be measured in the prospective cohort as informed by the retrospective study.\nThis study aims to increase knowledge surrounding the pathology of complications in monochorionic twins, to aid future diagnosis and management.\nISRCTN 13114861 (retrospectively registered).",

    "abstract": "Asthenozoospermia (AZS) is a common cause of male infertility, characterized by abnormal reduction in the motility of ejaculated spermatozoa. Here, in a patient from a consanguineous family, we identified a homozygous mutation (c.G4343A, p.R1448Q) in SPAG17 by whole-exome sequencing. The encoded protein, SPAG17, localizes to the axonemal central apparatus and is considered essential for flagellar waveform. In silico analysis revealed that R1448Q is a potential pathogenic mutation. Immunostaining and western blot assays showed that the R1448Q mutation may exert a negative effect on the steady-state of the SPAG17 protein. Therefore, SPAG17 may be a new pathogenic gene causing AZS.",

    "abstract": "Forensic association of hair shaft evidence with individuals is currently assessed by comparing mitochondrial DNA haplotypes of reference and casework samples, primarily for exclusionary purposes. Present work tests and validates more recent proteomic approaches to extract quantitative transcriptional and genetic information from hair samples of monozygotic twin pairs, which would be predicted to partition away from unrelated individuals if the datasets contain identifying information. Protein expression profiles and polymorphic, genetically variant hair peptides were generated from ten pairs of monozygotic twins. Profiling using the protein tryptic digests revealed that samples from identical twins had typically an order of magnitude fewer protein expression differences than unrelated individuals. The data did not indicate that the degree of difference within twin pairs increased with age. In parallel, data from the digests were used to detect genetically variant peptides that result from common nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes expressed in the hair follicle. Compilation of the variants permitted sorting of the samples by hierarchical clustering, permitting accurate matching of twin pairs. The results demonstrate that genetic differences are detectable by proteomic methods and provide a framework for developing quantitative statistical estimates of personal identification that increase the value of hair shaft evidence.",

Here, we describe monozygotic twin brothers with discordant clinical presentations. Intrauterine fetal growth restriction was present in both twins. Additionally, twin A exhibited coarctation of aorta, left ventricular noncompaction, atrial septal defect, pericardial effusion, left hydronephrosis, and moderate developmental delay, whereas twin B exhibited single umbilical artery. Chromosome microarray analysis was performed on both twins and their parents. An identical 244\u2009kb microdeletion on 16p11.2 including 9 Refseq genes, including SH2B1, was identified in the twins. The novel findings in monozygotic twins may expand the phenotypic spectrum of 16p11.2 microdeletion. Further studies are needed to strengthen the correlation between genotypes and abnormal clinical features.",

    "abstract": "Genetic and environmental factors contribute to the etiology of anorexia nervosa (AN). The co-twin control design is one of the most powerful methods available to evaluate environmental factors that could contribute to differences between monozygotic (MZ) twins who are discordant for AN. Using available data from a unique and rare sample of 22 Swedish female MZ pairs discordant for AN, we compared personality, life events, comorbidity, and health factors. Twins with AN had significantly higher perfectionism scores than unaffected co-twins and reported younger ages at first diet than unaffected co-twins who had dieted. Consistent with previous literature, more twins with AN reported gastrointestinal problems than unaffected co-twins. Although not significant due to low statistical power, more unaffected co-twins reported experiencing emotional neglect than twins with AN. Early dieting may be a harbinger of the development of AN or an early symptom. Higher perfectionism may represent a risk factor, sequela, or both. Sibling perception of neglect is noteworthy given the impact of an ill child with AN on family function and wellbeing. The health and wellbeing of siblings should be addressed clinically when one child in the family suffers from AN.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed our hospital protocol of vaginal delivery for twins and evaluated whether trial of vaginal delivery (unless contraindicated) was as safe as elective cesarean. Risk factors leading to failed trial of labor (TOL) were characterized to improve our ability to advise patients and select cases for TOL.\nThis retrospective, cohort study included women >32 weeks gestation, with twin A in cephalic presentation and no contraindications for vaginal delivery. Controls were women with twin pregnancy and planned cesarean delivery (PCD). Maternal and neonatal morbidity between TOL and PCD were compared. TOL group was subcategorized by vaginal or cesarean delivery to characterize pre-labor risk factors for failed TOL.\nOf the 411 twins, 215 had TOL and 196 had PCD. Among TOL, 196/215 (91%) delivered vaginally. TOL was more likely to have spontaneous pregnancy, pregnancy complications and tended to deliver earlier. More TOL had postpartum hemorrhage (p\u2009<\u2009.05), although transfusion rates in each group were similar. Neonatal outcomes between groups did not differ. Induction and gestational age at delivery were risk factors for failed TOL.\nThe results support the contemporary practice of TOL for twins at term when the first is in cephalic presentation with no other contraindications.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of Kawasaki disease (KD) remains unknown. However, many studies have suggested that specific genetic factors and/or some infectious agents underlie the onset of KD. Previous studies have suggested that human adenovirus (HAdV) is one of the triggering pathogens of KD. Here, we report monozygotic twin boys who sequentially developed KD in conjunction with acute HAdV type 3 (HAdV-3) infection.\nThe patients were four-year-old monozygotic twin boys. The elder brother developed a high fever and was diagnosed with HAdV infection with an immunochromatographic kit for HAdV (IC-kit). He was transferred to our institute after persistent fever for 7\u00a0days. On admission, he already fulfilled all the diagnostic criteria for KD. His laboratory data were as follows: WBC, 9700/\u03bcl; CRP, 2.42\u00a0mg/dl; IFN-\u03b3, 99.8\u00a0pg/ml; and TNF-\u03b1, 10.9\u00a0pg/ml. He received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin and responded well, with no coronary artery abnormalities. The younger brother, who was also IC-kit-positive, was hospitalized on the same day as his elder brother after persistent fever for 3\u00a0days. His data on admission were as follows: WBC, 12,600/\u03bcl; CRP, 5.54\u00a0mg/dl; IFN-\u03b3, 105.0\u00a0pg/ml; and TNF-\u03b1, 33.6\u00a0pg/ml. Although he developed all of the typical KD symptoms by day 4, his fever subsided spontaneously on day 6 without IVIG or aspirin. However, he developed a dilation of the coronary artery in the region of the left circumflex artery bifurcation on day 10. His coronary artery dilation had resolved 3\u00a0months after onset. HAdV-3 DNA was detected with PCR in stool samples from both patients, and HAdV3 was isolated from the younger brother's stool sample. Serum neutralizing antibodies to AdV3 were also significantly elevated in both patients, suggesting seroconversion.\nThere have been few reports of the simultaneous development of KD in monozygotic twins. Notably, both twins had an acute HAdV-3 infection immediately before they developed KD. These cases strongly suggest that KD was triggered by HAdV-3 infection, and they indicate that specific immune responses to some pathogens (such as HAdV-3), arising from genetic susceptibility, play a critical role in the pathogenesis of KD.",

    "abstract": "Job's syndrome or autosomal dominant hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (Hyper-IgE) is a rare disorder that results from a STAT3 gene mutation, which results in the absence of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells and manifests as a severe immunodeficiency. Affected individuals suffer recurrent soft tissue and pulmonary infections among other manifestations, and the spectrum of the disease is still being characterized. We describe 2 sisters with Job's syndrome each with variable expressivity. However, both patients developed proteinuric kidney disease and had biopsies confirming the presence of immune complex glomerulonephritis with staining for immunoglobulins and complement components. Previous reports link Job's syndrome and the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but proliferative immune complex glomerulonephritis has not been described. We speculate that continual internal and external antigen exposure may induce an autoimmune process similar to SLE, which in turn may account for the immune complex disease in the kidney.",

    "abstract": "There are two theories about the origin of os odontoideum: traumatic or congenital. However, most studies favor the hypothesis of traumatic theory. To emphasize the congenital theory, we report a pair of identical twins both with atlantoaxial dislocation and os odontoideum, which is believed to be a congenital defect.\nWe present two 14-year-old identical twins with atlantoaxial dislocation and os odontoideum. Neither of the twins had history of trauma in head nor cervical spine. We reviewed and compared the cervical radiographs of the identical twins. Posterior atlantoaxial reduction, pedicle screw fixation and atlantoaxial fusion were performed for the two twins.\nRadiological examination showed the identical twins had typical atlantoaxial dislocation and os odontoideum. The twins had high similarity in the appearance of atlantoaxial dislocation and os odontoideum. The etiology of the os odontoideum in the twins is believed to be congenital. Both the twins had improvement in neurological function after surgery.\nAlthough a great number of cases with os odontoideum have been reported to be traumatic, there are some cases believed to be congenital.",

    "abstract": "Tryptophan metabolism plays a crucial role in mediating gastrointestinal function. Here, in order to absolutely quantify tryptophan and its metabolites, a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based targeted metabolomics approach was developed using N-dimethyl-/N-diethyl-amino naphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride (Dns/Dens-Cl) as twins labeling (TL) reagents. Dns-Cl is famous in amine and phenol derivations, and structure is similar with Dens-Cl. The introduction of easily protonated moiety of tertiary ammonium-containing part in the derivatives from Dns to tryptophan and its metabolites not only improved the LC separation but also enhanced their MS response. In addition, the Dens labeled standards were used as internal standards to compensate for matrix effects and ensure accurate quantifications. With the proposed method, twelve metabolites in tryptophan pathway could be detected at sub-ng/mL levels using only 20\u03bcL rat serum (the limit of detection could reach 3pg/mL for tryptamine, N-acetyl-serotonin and 6-hydroxymelatonin). The sensitivity was enhanced about 1-2 orders of magnitude compared with non-derivatization method. Focusing on tryptophan pathway, the method was successfully applied to determine the absolute serum concentrations of twelve tryptophan metabolites in a vincristine-induced ileus rat model. A significant down-regulation of the tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway and up-regulation of serotonin pathway were uncovered. Our findings provide a deeper insight into the mechanism of gastrointestinal dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "To investigate longitudinal associations of smoking and a change in smoking status with leisure-time physical inactivity. In addition, to control whether familial confounding (genetics and shared environment) influences the associations.\nData were based on the population-based Finnish Adult Twin Cohort of 5254 twin individuals born in 1945-1957 (41% men) and who participated in all four surveys over a 35-year follow-up (1975-2011). Logistic and conditional logistic regression models with multiple covariates were used for analyses.\nCompared to never-smokers, long-term daily smokers (1975-1990) had the highest likelihood for both long-term inactivity and to change into inactive by 2011. Recurrent smoking was associated with long-term inactivity. Instead, in comparison to persistent daily smokers, quitting smoking decreased the likelihood of becoming physically inactive at leisure time. The associations remained in the analyses which accounted for multiple covariates and/or familial confounding.\nDaily smoking increases the likelihood of remaining or becoming physically inactive over the decades. Our results emphasize not only the importance of preventing smoking initiation, but also to support early smoking cessation in promotion of lifelong physical activity.",

    "abstract": "To explore the hypothesis that selective placental pathology affecting the nonpresenting twin is a significant contributory factor mediating the smaller size at birth of nonpresenting dichorionic twins.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of all dichorionic twin deliveries in a single tertiary center between 2002 and 2015 where by departmental policy, all placentas from multifetal gestations are routinely sent for pathologic examination. Maternal charts, neonatal charts, and pathology reports were reviewed. Placental abnormalities were classified into lesions associated with maternal vascular malperfusion, fetal vascular malperfusion, placental hemorrhage, and chronic villitis. Comparison of neonatal outcomes and placental abnormalities was made between all nonpresenting and all presenting twins as well as within twin pairs.\nA total of 1,322 women with dichorionic twins were studied. Nonpresenting twins were smaller at birth compared with the presenting cotwin starting at 32 weeks of gestation (birth weight [\u00b1standard deviation] 2,224\u00b1666 g compared with 2,278\u00b1675 g, P=.036). Nonpresenting twins had smaller placentas (361\u00b1108 g compared with 492\u00b1129 g, P<.001) as early as 24 weeks of gestation. Nonpresenting twins had higher odds for any placental abnormality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.91, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.63-2.23), small placenta (adjusted OR 4.69, 95% CI 3.75-5.88), and maternal vascular malperfusion (OR 2.75, 95% CI 2.32-3.27) compared with their presenting cotwins. In nonpresenting twins, the presence of maternal vascular malperfusion pathology was associated with lower birth weight compared with their presenting cotwin during the third trimester.\nThe lower birth weight of nonpresenting fetuses in dichorionic twin pregnancies is correlated with a higher rate of placental maternal vascular malperfusion pathology.",

    "abstract": "Hall (Embryologic development and monozygotic twinning. Acta Geneticae Medicae et Gemellologiae, Vol. 45, 1996, pp. 53-57) hypothesized that chromosomal aberrations can lead to monozygotic (MZ) twinning. However, twinning and chromosomal aberrations increase prenatal mortality and could reduce the prevalence of chromosomal aberrations in live-born twins. We compared prevalence proportion ratios (PPR) of chromosomal aberrations and trisomy 21 (T21) in live-born twins versus singletons born in Denmark during 1968-2009.\nWe linked the Danish Twin Registry and a 5% random sample of all singletons to the Danish Cytogenetic Central Register and calculated PPR adjusted for maternal age for MZ, dizygotic (DZ), and all twins versus singletons. Zygosity was based on questionnaires or genetic markers.\nNo overall difference in risk of chromosomal aberrations or T21 in twins versus singletons was found. PPR in MZ and DZ twins was 0.87 (95% CI [0.60, 1.27]) and 1.05 (95% CI [0.88, 1.27]), respectively. For T21 there was a tendency to a lower prevalence in MZ twins compared to singletons (PPR: 0.29, 95% CI [0.07, 1.14]), whereas PPR was significantly increased in DZ twins (1.62, 95% CI [1.20, 2.19]). The observed proportion of MZ twin pairs among twin pairs with aberrations (0.22, 95% CI [0.16, 0.28]) was significantly lower than the proportion expected from the Weinberg method (0.32, 95% CI [CI, 0.26, 0.39]).\nBased on databases providing complete national coverage on twins with chromosomal aberrations, we found no overall difference in risk of chromosomal aberrations or T21 in twins versus singletons. Around conception twins may have an increased risk of chromosomal aberrations, but loss of especially MZ embryos could lead to similar risk among live-born twins and singletons.",

    "abstract": "The comparison of traits in twins from opposite-sex (OS) and same-sex (SS) dizygotic twin pairs is considered a proxy measure of prenatal hormone exposure. To examine possible prenatal hormonal influences on anthropometric traits, we compared mean height, body mass index (BMI), and the prevalence of being overweight or obese between men and women from OS and SS dizygotic twin pairs.\nThe data were derived from the COllaborative project of Development of Anthropometrical measures in Twins (CODATwins) database, and included 68,494 SS and 53,808 OS dizygotic twin individuals above the age of 20\u00a0years from 31 twin cohorts representing 19 countries. Zygosity was determined by questionnaires or DNA genotyping depending on the study. Multiple regression and logistic regression models adjusted for cohort, age, and birth year with the twin type as a predictor were carried out to compare height and BMI in twins from OS pairs with those from SS pairs and to calculate the adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for being overweight or obese.\nOS females were, on average, 0.31\u00a0cm (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20, 0.41) taller than SS females. OS males were also, on average, taller than SS males, but this difference was only 0.14\u00a0cm (95% CI 0.02, 0.27). Mean BMI and the prevalence of overweight or obesity did not differ between males and females from SS and OS twin pairs. The statistically significant differences between OS and SS twins for height were small and appeared to reflect our large sample size rather than meaningful differences of public health relevance.\nWe found no evidence to support the hypothesis that prenatal hormonal exposure or postnatal socialization (i.e., having grown up with a twin of the opposite sex) has a major impact on height and BMI in adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twins are at risk of severe complications including twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS) and acute peripartum TTTS. The pathophysiology is based on inter-twin blood transfusion through placental vascular anastomoses. Areas covered: This review focuses on the incidence, management and outcome of neonatal hematological complications at birth in TTTS, TAPS and acute peripartum TTTS. Expert commentary: Hematological disorders are often present at birth in monochorionic twins and include acute or chronic anemia, polycythemia and thrombocytopenia. Routine measurement of complete blood counts in all complicated monochorionic twins is strongly recommended. Increased awareness on these disorders and correct diagnostic tests will lead to prompt and adequate management at birth.",

    "abstract": "Sotos syndrome is a congenital overgrowth disorder characterized by facial gestalt, excessively rapid growth, acromegalic features and a non-progressive cerebral disorder with intellectual disability.\nThe identical male twins showed somewhat different clinical, cognitive and behavioural phenotypes. Abnormal clinical manifestations including seizures, scoliosis, enlarged ventricles, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were found in the proband (first twin), but not in the sibling (second twin). We used diagnostic exome sequencing (DES) to identify a heterozygous de novo mutation of the NSD1 gene in monozygotic twins with Sotos syndrome.\nDES revealed a novel nonsense mutation c.2596G>T (p.Glu866*) of the NSD1 gene in the proband, the first of monozygotic twins. Sanger sequencing analysis of the proband and his family members showed that this nonsense mutation was present in the proband and his sibling, but was absent in their parents, indicating that it occurred with de novo origin.\nThis finding expands the phenotypic spectrum associated with variable expression of the Sotos syndrome caused by NSD1 mutation, and it adds further support for postconceptual mutation, epigenetic change and/or an environmental factor involved in the cause of the Sotos syndrome.",

    "abstract": "It is unknown whether the risk of adverse outcomes in twin pregnancies among subfertile women, conceived with and without in\u00a0vitro fertilization, differs from those conceived spontaneously.\nWe sought to evaluate the effects of fertility status on adverse perinatal outcomes in twin pregnancies on a population basis.\nAll twin live births of \u226522 weeks' gestation and \u2265350 g birthweight to Massachusetts resident women in 2004 through 2010 were linked to hospital discharge records, vital records, and in\u00a0vitro fertilization cycles. Women were categorized by their fertility status as in\u00a0vitro fertilization, subfertile, or fertile, and by twin pair genders (all, like, unlike). Women whose births linked to in\u00a0vitro fertilization cycles were classified as in\u00a0vitro fertilization; those with indicators of subfertility but without in\u00a0vitro fertilization treatment were classified as subfertile; all others were classified as fertile. Risks of 6 adverse pregnancy outcomes (gestational diabetes, pregnancy hypertension, uterine bleeding, placental complications [placenta abruptio, placenta previa, and vasa previa], prenatal hospitalizations, and primary cesarean) and 9 adverse infant outcomes (very low birthweight, low birthweight, small-for-gestation birthweight, large-for-gestation birthweight, very preterm [<32 weeks], preterm, birth defects, neonatal death, and infant death) were modeled by fertility status with the fertile group as reference, using multivariate log binomial regression and reported as adjusted relative risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals.\nThe study population included 10,352 women with twin pregnancies (6090 fertile, 724 subfertile, and 3538 in\u00a0vitro fertilization). Among all twins, the risks for all 6 adverse pregnancy outcomes were significantly increased for the subfertile and in\u00a0vitro fertilization groups, with highest risks for uterine bleeding (adjusted relative risk ratios, 1.92 and 2.58, respectively) and placental complications (adjusted relative risk ratios, 2.07 and 1.83, respectively). Among all twins, the risks for those born to subfertile women were significantly increased for very preterm birth and neonatal and infant death (adjusted relative risk ratios, 1.36, 1.89, and 1.87, respectively). Risks were significantly increased among in\u00a0vitro fertilization twins for very preterm birth, preterm birth, and birth defects (adjusted relative risk ratios, 1.28, 1.07, and 1.26, respectively).\nRisks of all maternal and most infant adverse outcomes were increased for subfertile and in\u00a0vitro fertilization twins. Among all twins, the highest risks were for uterine bleeding and placental complications for the subfertile and in\u00a0vitro fertilization groups, and neonatal and infant death in the subfertile group. These findings provide further evidence supporting single embryo transfer and more cautious use of ovulation induction.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (NFE2L2) is an important transcription factor that protects cells from oxidative stress (OS). NFE2L2 deficiency in placentas is associated with pregnancy complications. We have demonstrated that elevated OS existed in placental shares of the smaller fetus in selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR); however, the role of NFE2L2 in the development of sIUGR remains unknown. In this study, we examined the levels of NFE2L2 and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), a major antioxidant regulated by NFE2L2, in sIUGR placentas. We also investigated the relationship between hypoxia and NFE2L2 activation, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of sIUGR.\nReal-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the levels of NFE2L2 and HMOX1 in placentas from 30 monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies. The trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo was cultured under severe (3%) or mild (10%) hypoxia.\nNFE2L2 and HMOX1 were both up-regulated in placental shares of the smaller fetus in the sIUGR group. No significant inter-twin differences in NFE2L2 and HMOX1 were detected in the normal group. In vitro, NFE2L2 was suppressed under severe hypoxia (3% O\nCompared with the suppression of NFE2L2 in placentas of fetal growth restriction (FGR) in singleton pregnancies, NFE2L2 was up-regulated in placental shares of the smaller fetus in sIUGR pregnancies. The asymmetrical activation of NFE2L2 in placental shares of sIUGR twins may be a compensation for hypoxia that protects the smaller fetus from OS damage.",

    "abstract": "Acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. First described by Brandt in 1936 and was named by Danbolt. A mutation in the SLC39A4 gene on chromosome 8 q24.3 is responsible for this disorder, which encodes zinc transporter Zip4. The diagnosis is made by the clinical presentation and histopathology and laboratory tests. In this case, we reported a twin presented with a typical rash and low zinc level. To our knowledge, very few cases reported as a twin with typical acrodermatitis enteropathica presentation.\nFour months old twins both females, first children of a non-consanguineous marriage. The twins were born at term, caesarian section, with no complications. Presented with erythema, scaling, crusting and oozing over perioral, perianal areas, hands and feet of 2-3 week duration. The lesions started around the same time for both children with a history of intermittent diarrhea, and hair loss. There were no nail changes or neurological deficit or myopathy. There was a history of recent weaning from breast milk and now both children on formula feeds, ragi, fruits. There was no other significant history of other medical problems in the patients or in their family. On examination, erythema, scaling, crusting and oozing over perioral, perianal areas, hands and feet was seen. Minimal diffuse alopecia was noted. Nails were normal. No other abnormalities were observed. Clinical diagnosis of acrodermatitis enteropathica was considered and confirmed by low zinc levels (repeated plasma zinc levels were below 0.6 mcg/ml). The twins were managed with zinc supplementation 1 mg/kg/day. A significant improvement was seen within two weeks.\nEarly diagnosis of acrodermatitis enteropathica is essential for preventing complications. We report a rare case of typical clinical presentation of the disease developing simultaneously in twins.",

    "abstract": "The current systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the perinatal outcomes in twin pregnancies following multifetal pregnancy reduction (MPR) compared with non-reduced twins. We considered all studies comparing perinatal outcomes of twin pregnancies following MPR to non-reduced twin pregnancies. Our search yielded 639 publications, of which 91 were assessed for eligibility. A total of 22 studies met our inclusion criteria. Overall, fetal reduction of triplets to twins resulted in comparable perinatal outcomes to non-reduced twins with regards to gestational age and birthweight at delivery, pregnancy loss prior to 24 weeks, as well as the development of gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Of all outcomes, only the Caesarean section rate was significantly higher in the MPR group compared with the non-reduced twins group with an odds ratio of 1.95 (95% confidence interval 1.33-2.87). This meta-analysis suggests that MPR of triplet pregnancies to twins is associated with comparable perinatal outcomes to that of non-reduced twins. This information can further help in guiding, and probably reassuring, clinician and patient decision-making when faced with high-order multifetal pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmunity and chronic inflammation recognize numerous shared factors and, as a result, the resulting diseases frequently coexist in the same patients or respond to the same treatments. Among the convenient truths of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, there is now agreement that these are complex conditions in which the individual genetic predisposition provides a rate of heritability. The concordance rates in monozygotic and dizygotic twins allows to estimate the weight of the environment in determining disease susceptibility, despite recent data supporting that only a minority of immune markers depend on hereditary factors. Concordance rates in monozygotic and dizygotic twins should be evaluated over an observation period to minimize the risk of false negatives and this is well represented by type I diabetes mellitus. Further, concordance rates in monozygotic twins should be compared to those in dizygotic twins, which share 50% of their genes, as in regular siblings, but also young-age environmental factors. Twin studies have been extensively performed in several autoimmune conditions and cumulatively suggest that some diseases, i.e. celiac disease and psoriasis, are highly genetically determined, while rheumatoid arthritis or systemic sclerosis have a limited role for genetics. These observations are necessary to interpret data gathered by genome-wide association studies of polymorphisms and DNA methylation in MZ twins. New high-throughput technological platforms are awaited to provide new insights into the mechanisms of disease discordance in twins beyond strong associations such as those with HLA alleles.",

    "abstract": "To determine if the large and highly reproducible interindividual differences in arousal intensity and heart rate response to arousal (\u0394HR) during non-REM sleep are heritable.\nPolysomnograms of 55 monozygotic (14 male and 41 female pairs) and 36 dizygotic (15 male and 21 female pairs) same-sex twin pairs were analyzed. Arousals were scored using the 2012 American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria. Arousal intensity was scaled (between 0 and 9) using an automatic algorithm based on the change in electroencephalogram time and frequency characteristics. The \u0394HR was determined at each arousal. We calculated average arousal duration, average arousal intensity, average overall \u0394HR, average \u0394HR at a given arousal intensity, slope of \u0394HR per arousal intensity, and arousal intensity threshold of \u0394HR.\nThe intraclass correlations among monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs were 0.663 and 0.146, respectively, for average arousal intensity, and 0.449 and 0, respectively, for arousal intensity threshold of \u0394HR controlling for age, sex, and race. These values imply large broad sense heritability (H2) for these traits. This evidence was confirmed by a robust maximum likelihood-based variance components estimation approach, with an additive genetic heritability of 0.64 (95% confidence interval: 0.48 to 0.80) for average arousal intensity and a combined additive and dominance genetic heritability and of 0.46 (0.25 to 0.68) for arousal intensity threshold of \u0394HR. Results also suggested significant additive genetic effects for average arousal duration, \u0394HR at arousal intensity scale 4 and the overall average \u0394HR.\nGenetic factors explain a significant fraction of the phenotypic variability for average arousal intensity and arousal intensity threshold of \u0394HR. Results suggest that the duration of arousals and specific average \u0394HR values may also be heritable traits.\nNCT02827461.",

    "abstract": "Early maturation, indexed by pubertal development (PD), has been associated with earlier initiation and greater frequency of adolescent substance use, but this relationship may be biased by confounding factors and effects that change across development. Using a population-based Finnish twin sample (N = 3,632 individuals), we conducted twin modeling and multilevel structural equation modeling of the relationship between PD and substance use at ages 12-22. Shared environmental factors contributed to early PD and heavier substance use for females. Biological father absence was associated with early PD for boys but not girls, and did not account for the relationship between PD and substance use. The association between early PD and heavier substance use was partially due to between-family confounds, although early PD appeared to qualitatively alter long-term trajectories for some substances (nicotine), but not others (alcohol). Mediation by peer and parental factors did not explain this relationship within families. However, higher peer substance use and lower parental monitoring were themselves associated with heavier substance use, strengthening the existing evidence for these factors as targets for prevention/intervention efforts. Early maturation was not supported as a robust determinant of alcohol use trajectories in adolescence and young adulthood, but may require longer term follow-up. Subtle effects of early PD on nicotine and illicit drug use trajectories throughout adolescence and adulthood merit further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Dizygotic monochorionic twin pregnancies can result in blood chimerism due to in utero twin-to-twin exchange of stem cells. In this case, we examined the proportion of allogeneic red blood cells by flow cytometry and the proportion of allogeneic nucleated cells by digital polymerase chain reaction at 7 months and again at 5 years. We found an increase in the proportion of allogeneic cells from 63% to 89% in one twin, and a similar increase in autologous cells in the other twin from 57% to 84%. A paradigm for stem cell therapy could be modeled on this case: induction of tolerance and chimerism by antenatal transfusion of donor stem cells. The procedure would hold the promise of transplantation and tolerance induction without myeloablative conditioning for inheritable benign hematological diseases such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia.",

It was later found to be inherited from the mother, who did not present with abnormal phenotypes.\nA pregnant woman underwent amniocentesis at 16 weeks of gestation because of advanced maternal age. This pregnancy was monozygotic twins conceived naturally. A cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes revealed 46,XY,?dup(8)(q21.2). Chromosomal microarray revealed no abnormalities. C-banding and fluorescent in situ hybridization using chromosome 8 painting probe suggested euchromatic nature of the extra chromosomal band. Karyotyping of the parents showed that the EV was inherited from the mother.\nMany, but not all, EVs are clinically innocuous. This is the first case of 8q21.2 EV reported in the ethnic Han. More cases are needed to clarify whether 8q21.2 duplication as a bona fide EV.",

    "abstract": "This study examined genetic and environmental influences on the lipid concentrations of 1028 male twins using the novel univariate non-normal structural equation modeling (nnSEM) ADCE and ACE models. In the best fitting nnSEM ADCE model that was also better than the nnSEM ACE model, additive genetic factors (A) explained 4%, dominant genetic factors (D) explained 17%, and common (C) and unique (E) environmental factors explained 47% and 33% of the total variance of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The percentage of variation explained for other lipids was 0% (A), 30% (D), 34% (C) and 37% (E) for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); 30, 0, 31 and 39% for total cholesterol; and 0, 31, 12 and 57% for triglycerides. It was concluded that additive and dominant genetic factors simultaneously affected HDL-C concentrations but not other lipids. Common and unique environmental factors influenced concentrations of all lipids.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins share an identical DNA sequence but are not truly \"identical\". In fact, when it comes to health and disease, they may often display some level of phenotypic discordance. The cause of this discordance is often unknown. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNAs-mediated regulation regulate gene expression and are sensitive to external stimuli. These modifications may be seen to bridge the gap between genetics and the environment. Over the years, the importance of epigenetics as a primary mechanism for the role that the environment plays in defining phenotype has been increasingly appreciated. Mechanisms of epigenetics include DNA methylation, histone modifications and microRNAs. Discordance rates in monozygotic twins vary depending on the specific condition, from 11% in SLE to 64% in psoriasis and 77% in PBC. Other autoimmune diseases in which discordance is found among monozygotic twins has also been studied include type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyositis and systemic sclerosis. In some cases, the differences in various epigenetic modifications is slight, even though the concordance rate is low, suggesting that epigenetics is not the only factor that needs to be considered. Nonetheless, the study of phenotypic discordance in monozygotic twins may shed light on the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and contribute to the development of new methodologies for the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.",

    "abstract": "Altered reward reactivity is a potential risk endophenotype for eating disorders (EDs). The aim of this study was to examine reward reactivity in female twins with EDs and compare it with a twin control group. A sample of 112 twins [n\u2009=\u200951 met lifetime DSM-IV ED criteria (anorexia nervosa n\u2009=\u200926; bulimic disorders n\u2009=\u200924), n\u2009=\u200919 unaffected cotwins and n\u2009=\u200942 control twins] was administered measures assessing reward reactivity, including the Game of Dice Task, the Behavioural Inhibition/Activation (BIS/BAS) Scales and the Appetitive Motivation Scale (AMS). Within pair, correlations for monozygotic and dizygotic twins were calculated and generalised estimating equations compared probands with non-ED cotwins and controls. The BAS and the AMS were reduced in EDs and negatively associated with restrictive symptoms. In addition, monozygotic twins pairs demonstrated significant within pair similarity for the BAS and AMS. Conversely, there was less evidence to support the BIS or risky decision-making as measured by the Game of Dice Task as an endophenotype in EDs.

    "abstract": "Negative bias and aberrant neural processing of emotional faces are trait-marks of depression but findings in healthy high-risk groups are conflicting.\nHealthy middle-aged dizygotic twins (N = 42) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): 22 twins had a co-twin history of depression (high-risk) and 20 were without co-twin history of depression (low-risk). During fMRI, participants viewed fearful and happy faces while performing a gender discrimination task. After the scan, they were given a faces dot-probe task, a facial expression recognition task and questionnaires assessing mood, personality traits and coping.\nUnexpectedly, high-risk twins showed reduced fear vigilance and lower recognition of fear and happiness relative to low-risk twins. During face processing in the scanner, high-risk twins displayed distinct negative functional coupling between the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex and pregenual anterior cingulate. This was accompanied by greater fear-specific fronto-temporal response and reduced fronto-occipital response to all emotional faces relative to baseline. The risk groups showed no differences in mood, subjective state or coping.\nLess susceptibility to fearful faces and negative cortico-limbic coupling during emotional face processing may reflect neurocognitive compensatory mechanisms in middle-aged dizygotic twins who remain healthy despite their familial risk of depression.",

    "abstract": "The concept of twin concordance involves quantifying the resemblance between co-twins in an \"objective\" and reproducible way. Yet, quantifying resemblance in the case of complex psychiatric traits like schizophrenic disorders leads to methodological problems, as the yes-no dichotomy of diagnostic schemata does not allow one to assess between-subject differences in psychopathology patterns sufficiently accurately. Therefore, we relied on a multidimensional, quantitative concordance measure that provided a high resolution and differentiation when assessing the resemblance of psychopathology patterns. This concordance measure was central to our investigations into the potential link between schizophrenic disorders and aberrancies of the inflammatory response system. Specifically, we aimed to determine the extent to which (1) the observed variation of between-subject psychopathology concordance among 100 schizophrenic patients and (2) the observed variation of within-pair psychopathology concordance among 71 twin pairs can be explained by immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels. To accomplish this goal, we had to \"gauge\" in a first step the concordance measure's performance by (1) comparing the psychopathology patterns of 269 index cases suffering from functional psychoses with the respective patterns of the 350 \"affecteds\" among their first-degree relatives; (2) systematically comparing the psychopathology patterns of 100 unrelated patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenic disorders with each other; and (3) detailing the within-pair concordance of elementary traits among 2734 healthy twin pairs. As to the role of active immune processes in the context of schizophrenic disorders, we found that there exists a 20-30% subgroup of patients for whom aberrancies of the inflammatory response system, as quantified through IgM levels, appeared to be linked to the pathogenesis of schizophrenic disorders (r\u2009=\u20090.7515/0.8184, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The variation of within-pair psychopathology concordance among twins with schizophrenic disorders was found to be \"explainable\" in part by chronically elevated IgM levels (24.5% of observed phenotypic variance; p\u2009=\u20090.0434), thus suggesting that monozygotic twins concordant for schizophrenic disorders may possess a less \"robust\" variant of the inflammatory response system which can more easily be triggered by exogenous factors than the more \"robust\" variants of discordant pairs. Though the underlying biological mechanisms remain to be detected, our data have cleared the way for an early identification of patients with schizophrenic disorders for whom the inflammatory response system may be a target for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, our results will likely lead to new treatment strategies that involve elements of personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "We present the case of a pair of 45-year-old monozygotic twins (A and B) diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) at age 20 (A) and 22 (B) with similar presenting symptoms: diarrhea, fever and weight loss. Both of them had duodenal and ileocolonic disease (A2, L3+L4 according to Montreal classification); twin B also presented jejunal involvement and perianal disease (B1p). They received treatment with antibiotics, corticosteroids, 5-ASA, azathioprine and anti-TNF with a poor control of activity. They both developed a coloduodenal fistula that required surgery. Twin A developed the fistula 12 years after the first presentation; fistula closure with duodenorraphy and ileocolonic resection with gastrojejunostomy was performed. Twin B developed the fistula 22 years after the first presentation, and right colectomy, partial duodenectomy and duodenorraphy was carried out. Both developed an enterocutaneous fistula during the postoperative period. With intensive medical treatment, both twins remain asymptomatic.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary endocrine neoplasias, including phaeochromocytoma/paraganglioma and medullary thyroid cancer, are caused by autosomal dominant mutations in several familial cancer genes. A common feature of these diseases is the presentation of multiple primary tumours, or multifocal disease representing independent tumour clones that have arisen from the same initiating genetic lesion, but have undergone independent clonal evolution. Such tumours provide an opportunity to discover common cooperative changes required for tumourigenesis, while controlling for the genetic background of the individual. We performed genomic analysis of synchronous and metachronous tumours from five patients bearing germline mutations in the genes SDHB, RET, and MAX. Using whole exome sequencing and high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, we analysed two to four primary tumours from each patient. We also applied multi-region sampling, to assess intratumoural heterogeneity and clonal evolution, in two cases involving paraganglioma and medullary thyroid cancer, respectively. Heterogeneous patterns of genomic change existed between synchronous or metachronous tumours, with evidence of branching evolution. We observed striking examples of evolutionary convergence involving the same rare somatic copy-number events in synchronous primary phaeochromocytoma/paraganglioma. Convergent events also occurred during clonal evolution of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. These observations suggest that genetic or epigenetic changes acquired early within precursor cells, or pre-existing within the genetic background of the individual, create contingencies that determine the evolutionary trajectory of the tumour.

    "abstract": "Back pain and type 2 diabetes often co-occur, resulting in greater impact on people's health and complexity in their care. Plausible causal mechanisms for this association have been proposed, yet the nature of the link remains unclear. We therefore explored the direction of the association between type 2 diabetes and chronic back pain in twins, controlling for genetics and early environmental confounding.\n2,096 and 1,098 twins were included in the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, respectively. Any or severe (\u2265 9) low back pain (LBP), neck pain (NP), and spinal pain (concurrent LBP and NP) and type 2 diabetes were investigated. Sequential analyses were performed using logistic regression. Firstly, twins were analysed unpaired (adjusted age and gender): total sample analyses. Then, to control for genetic and shared environmental factors, a co-twin case-control analysis was performed including monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs discordant for back pain (cross-sectional only).\nIn the cross-sectional total sample analyses, type 2 diabetes was associated with chronic spinal pain (OR 1.61; 95%CI 1.12 to 2.31), severe chronic spinal pain (OR 3.33; 95%CI 1.47 to 7.53), chronic NP (OR 1.37; 95%CI 1.01 to 1.85), severe chronic NP (OR 2.28; 95%CI 1.24 to 4.21), and severe chronic LBP (OR 1.63; 95%CI 1.00 to 2.64). After further adjustment for genetic and shared environmental factors, none of the associations remained significant. The longitudinal analyses indicated that the presence of type 2 diabetes did not increase the risk of future back pain, or vice-versa, after two to four years.\nChronic back pain (spinal pain, NP, or LBP) was associated with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Associations are stronger for severe cases of pain. Future research should investigate the temporal relationships between these conditions with longer follow up in twins.",

    "abstract": "Habitual short sleep duration is associated with adverse metabolic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory effects. Co-twin study methodologies account for familial (eg, genetics and shared environmental) confounding, allowing assessment of subtle environmental effects, such as the effect of habitual short sleep duration on gene expression. Therefore, we investigated gene expression in monozygotic twins discordant for actigraphically phenotyped habitual sleep duration.\nEleven healthy monozygotic twin pairs (82% female; mean age 42.7 years; SD = 18.1), selected based on subjective sleep duration discordance, were objectively phenotyped for habitual sleep duration with 2 weeks of wrist actigraphy. Peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) RNA from fasting blood samples was obtained on the final day of actigraphic measurement and hybridized to Illumina humanHT-12 microarrays. Differential gene expression was determined between paired samples and mapped to functional categories using Gene Ontology. Finally, a more comprehensive gene set enrichment analysis was performed based on the entire PBL transcriptome.\nThe mean 24-hour sleep duration of the total sample was 439.2 minutes (SD = 46.8 minutes; range 325.4-521.6 minutes). Mean within-pair sleep duration difference per 24 hours was 64.4 minutes (SD = 21.2; range 45.9-114.6 minutes). The twin cohort displayed distinctive pathway enrichment based on sleep duration differences. Habitual short sleep was associated with up-regulation of genes involved in transcription, ribosome, translation, and oxidative phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, genes down-regulated in short sleep twins were highly enriched in immuno-inflammatory pathways such as interleukin signaling and leukocyte activation, as well as developmental programs, coagulation cascade, and cell adhesion.\nObjectively assessed habitual sleep duration in monozygotic twin pairs appears to be associated with distinct patterns of differential gene expression and pathway enrichment. By accounting for familial confounding and measuring real life sleep duration, our study shows the transcriptomic effects of habitual short sleep on dysregulated immune response and provides a potential link between sleep deprivation and adverse metabolic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This prospective cohort study evaluated whether the cognitive development, neurological condition, anthropometrics and blood pressure of 4-year-old IVF twins differed from those of 4-year-old IVF singletons; 103 IVF singletons and 48 IVF twins born after conventional IVF treatment were included. Primary outcome was total intelligence quotient (IQ). Secondary outcomes were minor neurological dysfunction, anthropometrics and blood pressure. Unadjusted analyses found that the total IQ score of twins was lower than that of singletons, with a mean difference of -5.4 (-9.7 to -1.0). Weight (singletons: 18.6 [18.1 to 19.1] kg; twins: 16.9 [16.0 to 17.9] kg) and height (singletons: 108.8 [107.9 to 109.8] cm; twins: 105.9 [104.0 to 107.7] cm) of twins were lower than those of singletons (mean values [95% CI]). All differences disappeared after adjusting for mediators and confounders. Neurological outcome, systolic and diastolic blood pressure of twins and singletons were similar. Four-year-old IVF twins had a lower total IQ (-5.4 points), lowerbodyweight (-1.7\u2009kg) and were shorter (-2.9\u2009cm) than 4-year-old IVF singletons. After adjustment, the adverse twin effect disappeared, implying that increased risk for impaired health and development in twins also holds true for IVF twins, and is not altered by IVF.",

    "abstract": "Mature cystic teratomas are the most common among all ovarian neoplasms, representing 30-40% of the cases. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been only two reports of mature cystic teratomas occurring in identical twins to date. We herein report a case of identical twins with mature cystic teratomas who were treated with laparoscopic surgery. A 32-year-old woman was referred to our hospital due to a tumor in the right ovary. The patient underwent laparoscopic resection of the ovarian tumor and the pathological diagnosis was benign mature cystic teratoma. Two years later, the identical twin of the abovementioned patient was referred to our hospital also due to a right ovarian tumor. The patient underwent laparoscopic resection of the ovarian tumor and the pathological diagnosis was benign mature cystic teratoma. Therefore, for early diagnosis, it may be important to consider the possibility of mature cystic teratoma in the identical twin of a patient, even in the absence of symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The formation mechanism considers fivefold deformation twins originating from the grain boundaries in a nanocrystalline material, resulting in that fivefold deformation twins derived from a single crystal have not been reported by molecular dynamics simulations. In this study, fivefold deformation twins are observed in a single crystal of face-centered cubic (fcc) alloy. A new formation mechanism is proposed for fivefold deformation twins in a single crystal. A partial dislocation is emitted from the incoherent twin boundaries (ITBs) with high energy, generating a stacking fault along {111} plane, and resulting in the nucleating and growing of a twin by the successive emission of partials. A node is fixed at the intersecting center of the four different slip {111} planes. With increasing stress under the indentation, ITBs come into being close to the node, leading to the emission of a partial from the node. This generates a stacking fault along a {111} plane, nucleating and growing a twin by the continuous emission of the partials. This process repeats until the formation of fivefold deformation twins.",

    "abstract": "Microneurographic recordings of human muscle sympathetic nerve activity responses to sudden sensory stimuli (ie, arousal) have revealed 2 intraindividually reproducible response profiles in healthy young males that predict different neural and blood pressure responses to more sustained stress. Approximately 50% of subjects inhibit muscle sympathetic nerve activity during arousal, whereas the remaining 50% do not, and the latter group displays a markedly greater blood pressure increase in response to arousal, as well as during and after 3 minutes of mental arithmetic. Studying a group of monozygotic twins (10 pairs, 2 excluded from analysis), the aim of the present study was to evaluate the degree of genetic determination of these sympathetic response profiles. Muscle sympathetic burst incidence at rest was similar in twins, with a within-pair burst incidence ratio of 0.87\u00b10.02 (SEM) compared with 0.73\u00b10.07 found in unrelated pairs (",

    "abstract": "Research shows that perceived family cohesion is positively related to prosocial behavior in adolescents. In this study, we investigated heritability of prosocial behavior (PB) and perceived family cohesion (FC) among Nigerian twins attending public schools in Lagos State, Nigeria (mean age = 14.7 years, SD = 1.7 years), and explored the issue of whether children's perception of cohesive family environment moderated genetic and environmental influences on (PB). The PB scale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the FC scale of the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale III were completed by 2,376 twins (241 monozygotic (MZ) male, 354 MZ female, 440 dizygotic (DZ) male, 553 DZ female, and 788 opposite-sex DZ twins). A general sex-limitation and the bivariate genotype by environment interaction (G\u00d7E) models were applied to the data. The general sex-limitation model showed no significant sex differences, indicating that additive genetic and non-shared environmental influences were, 38% (95% CI = 31, 46) and 62% (95% CI = 54, 69) for PB and 33% (95% CI = 24, 40) and 67% (95% CI = 60, 76) for FC in both sexes. These estimates were similar to those found in Western and Asian twin studies to date. The correlation between PB and FC was 0.36. The best-fitting bivariate G\u00d7E model indicated that FC significantly moderated non-shared environmental influence unique to PB (E\u00d7E interaction). Specifically, non-shared environmental contributions to PB were highest when FC was lowest, and decreased as the levels of FC increased. However, genetic variances in PB were stable across all levels of FC. These findings suggest that FC reduces individual differences in PB by changing non-shared environmental experiences rather than genetic factors in PB.",

    "abstract": "In 2014, in the United States, nearly 7% of newborns were twins. Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are more frequent in both monozygotic and dizygotic twins than in singletons. Still, the longer-term prognosis for CHD twins is unknown. Here we assess the mortality pattern for CHD twins up to age 36\u00a0years and compare it with that for non-CHD twins, non-CHD co-twins, and CHD singletons. We identified all twins and a 5% random sample of all singletons born in Denmark from 1977 to 2009 by linking Danish national population and health registers. CHD cases were defined as subjects having a primary inpatient diagnosis of CHD (excluding preterm ductus) within the first year of life, and mortality was assessed through 2013. Among 63,362 live-born twin individuals, a total of 373 twins (0.59%) had a CHD diagnosis, whereas the corresponding numbers for singletons were 383 of 98,647 (0.39%). During the follow-up, 82 (22.0%) CHD twins died compared with 91 (23.8%) CHD singletons (p\u00a0= 0.56). Despite a 5 times higher proportion of prematurity, CHD twins had a tendency toward only a moderately increased neonatal mortality compared with CHD singletons (hazard ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 2.5), and after the neonatal period up to age 36 the tendency was reversed (hazard ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.2). A potential underlying mechanism for this mortality pattern is selective intrauterine and neonatal mortality of twins with the most severe CHD. In conclusion, the study indicates that the overall survival prognosis for CHD twins is similar to that of CHD singletons.",

    "abstract": "The association of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and DNA methylation has been studied predominantly at regulatory regions of imprinted genes and at just thousands of the ~28 million CpG sites in the human genome.\nWe investigated the links between IVF and DNA methylation patterns in whole cord blood cells (n\u2009=\u200998) and cord blood mononuclear cells (n\u2009=\u200982) from newborn twins using genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing.\nAt a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, we identified one significant whole blood DNA methylation change linked to conception via IVF, which was located ~3\u00a0kb upstream of TNP1, a gene previously linked to male infertility. The 46 most strongly associated signals (FDR of 25%) included a second region in a gene also previously linked to infertility, C9orf3, suggesting that our findings may in part capture the effect of parental subfertility. Using twin modelling, we observed that individual-specific environmental factors appear to be the main overall contributors of methylation variability at the FDR 25% IVF-associated differentially methylated regions, although evidence for methylation heritability was also obtained at several of these regions. We replicated previous findings of differential methylation associated with IVF at the H19/IGF2 region in cord blood mononuclear cells, and we validated the signal at C9orf3 in monozygotic twins. We also explored the impact of intracytoplasmic sperm injection on the FDR 25% signals for potential effects specific to male or female infertility factors.\nTo our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of DNA methylation profiles at birth and IVF conception to date, and our results show evidence for epigenetic modifications that may in part reflect parental subfertility.",

    "abstract": "The phenotypic and biochemical similarities between caspase-mediated apoptosis and cellular differentiation are striking. They include such diverse phenomenon as mitochondrial membrane perturbations, cytoskeletal rearrangements and DNA fragmentation. The parallels between the two disparate processes suggest some common ancestry and highlight the paradoxical nature of the death-centric view of caspases. That is, what is the driving selective pressure that sustains death-inducing proteins throughout eukaryotic evolution? Plausibly, caspase function may be rooted in a primordial non-death function, such as cell differentiation, and was co-opted for its role in programmed cell death. This review will delve into the links between caspase-mediated apoptosis and cell differentiation and examine the distinguishing features of these events. More critically, we chronicle the evolutionary origins of caspases and propose that caspases may have held an ancient role in mediating the fidelity of cell division/differentiation through its effects on proteostasis and protein quality control.",

    "abstract": "Palatal rugae patterns are anatomic structures considered unique to each person. Monozygotic twins present similarities, however, Rugoscopy in particular, may contribute to their individualization for forensic purposes. The aims of this study were: to study the palatal rugae classifications of Bri\u00f1\u00f3n; to propose improvements to facilitate use of this method, if pertinent; and to characterize palatal rugae in a sample of Brazilian monozygotic twins and singletons. Precise reproducibility of the two methods of Bri\u00f1\u00f3n, from 1982 and 2011, was prevented by poor intra-examiner agreement (70% and 13% respectively). Our proposed improvements to these methods, although preliminary, were associated with better results. The most common palatal rugae patterns were types A, M, and Q. Palatal rugae were confirmed to be unique to each individual, even in monozygotic twins. Furthermore, twins did not exhibit any special patterns that might facilitate their differentiation from singletons.",

    "abstract": "The study of monozygotic twins discordant for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can elucidate mechanisms that contribute to the disorder, which affects ~7% of children. First, using in vivo neuroanatomic imaging on 14 pairs of monozygotic twins (mean age 9.7, s.d. 1.9 years), we found that discordance for the disorder is mirrored by differing dimensions of deep brain structures (the striatum and cerebellum), but not the cerebral cortex. Next, using whole-blood DNA from the same twins, we found a significant enrichment of epigenetic differences in genes expressed in these 'discordant' brain structures. Specifically, there is differential methylation of probes lying in the shore and shelf and enhancer regions of striatal and cerebellar genes. Notably, gene sets pertaining to the cerebral cortex (which did not differ in volume between affected and unaffected twins) were not enriched by differentially methylated probes. Genotypic differences between the twin pairs-such as copy number and rare, single-nucleotide variants-did not contribute to phenotypic discordance. Pathway analyses of the genes implicated by the most differentially methylated probes implicated \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine and serotonin neurotransmitter systems. The study illustrates how neuroimaging can help guide the search for epigenomic mechanisms in neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the placental characteristics in selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) using gradient angiography and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from computed tomography (CT) scan data.\nThis study included 23 sIUGR cases and 16 monochorionic twin-pregnancies without sIUGR. We injected nonionic iodinated contrast agents into the umbilical arteries and veins. Placental characteristics were analyzed after CT scanning and 3D reconstruction.\n73.9% of smaller twins in sIUGR cases had marginal or velamentous cord insertions and less placental sharing. The terminal branch of the arterial tree was scored III-IV in smaller sIUGR twins, while it was scored V-VII in normal monochorionic twins and larger sIUGR twins. Arterio-arterial (A-A) anastomoses presented in all monochorionic placentas. Veno-venous (V-V) anastomoses present in 83.3% (5/6) of Type III sIUGR cases, which was higher than observed in Type I-II cases. The mean diameters of A-A and V-V anastomoses were larger in Type III sIUGR cases.\nGradient angiography and 3D placental models displayed different placental angioarchitectures and voluminal placental sharing among three types of sIUGR cases. Placental dysplasia in the smaller twin may cause abnormal cord insertion and unequal placental sharing. The inter-twin anatomoses influence the umbilical cord artery (UA) Doppler and natural pathogenesis of sIUGR.",

    "abstract": "Familial cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) are exceedingly rare, and its occurrence in monozygotic twins has not been reported previously.\nWe report monozygotic female twins who developed IIH, one at age 25 years and the other at age 28 years. Continuous intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring confirmed elevated ICP as measured initially by lumbar puncture. In both cases, successful treatment with resolution of papilledema and symptoms relief was achieved after ventriculoperitoneal shunting.\nThis report documents the first case of IIH in monozygotic twins and the associated changes in ICP dynamics. Interestingly, almost equivalent alterations in ICP dynamics were found in the 2 patients.",

    "abstract": "The ability to inhibit prepotent but context- or goal-inappropriate responses is essential for adaptive self-regulation of behavior. Deficits in response inhibition, a key component of impulsivity, have been implicated as a core dysfunction in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as ADHD and addictions. Identification of genetically transmitted variation in the neural underpinnings of response inhibition can help to elucidate etiological pathways to these disorders and establish the links between genes, brain, and behavior. However, little is known about genetic influences on the neural mechanisms of response inhibition during adolescence, a developmental period characterized by weak self-regulation of behavior. Here we investigated heritability of ERPs elicited in a Go/No-Go task in a large sample of adolescent twins assessed longitudinally at ages 12, 14, and 16. Genetic analyses showed significant heritability of inhibition-related frontal N2 and P3 components at all three ages, with 50 to 60% of inter-individual variability being attributable to genetic factors. These genetic influences included both common genetic factors active at different ages and novel genetic influences emerging during development. Finally, individual differences in the rate of developmental changes from age 12 to age 16 were significantly influenced by genetic factors. In conclusion, the present study provides the first evidence for genetic influences on neural correlates of response inhibition during adolescence and suggests that ERPs elicited in the Go/No-Go task can serve as intermediate neurophysiological phenotypes (endophenotypes) for the study of disinhibition and impulse control disorders.",

    "abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affecting the lining of digestive tracts of the colon and ileum. To investigate the reasons behind the presence of CD phenotype in one of the monozygotic (MZ) twins, we utilized the whole exome sequence (WES) datasets of CD tissue biopsy and CD blood of affected twin and the exome dataset of blood from healthy twin. We report the presence of discordant and rare damaging mutation in HNRNPD and other risk polymorphisms such as, rs12103, rs2241880, rs3810936, rs7076156, rs1042058 and rs1292053. HNRNPD was found carrying two novel heterozygous mutations - a stop gain mutation that truncated the protein at 249th and 268th amino acid position and a single base missense mutation replacing Aspartate with Valine at 300th amino acid. The identified risk polymorphisms were found conferring susceptibility to CD and IBD. Discordant deleterious and damaging mutation was detected in HNRNPD that have been implicated in inflammatory pathways. Integrating these variants led to the elucidation of pathophysiology of CD in the affected twin involving the causal processes of macrophage activation, tissue death, autophagy, immune response, cell-migration and T-cell activation.",

    "abstract": "Acute leukaemia is the major subtype of paediatric cancer with a cumulative risk of 1 in 2000 for children up to the age of 15 years. Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a biologically and clinically diverse disease with distinctive subtypes; multiple chromosomal translocations exist within the subtypes and each carries its own prognostic relevance. The most common chromosome translocation observed is the t(12;21) that results in an in-frame fusion between the first five exons of ETV6 (TEL) and almost the entire coding region of RUNX1 (AML1).The natural history of childhood ALL is almost entirely clinically silent and is well advanced at the point of diagnosis. It has, however, been possible to backtrack this process through molecular analysis of appropriate clinical samples: (i) leukaemic clones in monozygotic twins that are either concordant or discordant for ALL; (ii) archived neonatal blood spots or Guthrie cards from individuals who later developed leukaemia; and (iii) stored, viable cord blood cells.Here, we outline our studies on the aetiology and pathology of childhood ALL that provide molecular evidence for a monoclonal, prenatal origin of ETV6-RUNX1+ leukaemia in monozygotic identical twins. We provide mechanistic support for the concept that altered patterns of infection during early childhood can deliver the necessary promotional drive for the progression of ETV6-RUNX1+ pre-leukaemic cells into a postnatal overt leukaemia.",

This is the first clinical report on mature and immature teratomas of the ovary in monozygotic twins. Our cases support future clarification of the molecular mechanism and pathogenesis of teratoma.",

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal (MS) complaints are reported commonly, but the extent to which such complaints reflect the severity of site-specific pathology or a more generalized susceptibility to feel pain/discomfort is uncertain. Both site-specific and more widespread MS conditions have been shown to be linked to anxiety and depression, but the nature of this relationship is poorly understood. In the present study the role of neuroticism as a shared risk factor that may possibly explain the co-occurrence between anxiety-depression and MS complaints was investigated.\nThe sample consisted of 746 monozygotic and 770 dizygotic twins in the age group of 50-65 years (M = 57.11, SD = 4.5). Using Cholesky modeling, genetic and environmental influences on neuroticism, anxiety-depression and MS symptoms, and the associations among these phenotypes were determined.\nA single factor accounted for about 50% of the overall variance in MS symptom reporting. The best-fitting biometric model included sex-specific additive genetic and individual-specific environmental effects. All 3 phenotypes were strongly influenced by genetic factors, heritability (h2) = 0.41-0.56. Furthermore, while there was a considerable overlap in genetic risk factors among the 3 phenotypes, a substantial proportion of the genetic risk shared between MS complaints and anxiety-depression was independent of neuroticism.\nEvidence for a common underlying susceptibility to report MS symptoms, genetically linked to both neuroticism and anxiety-depression symptoms, was found.

    "abstract": "Birth weight percentiles by gestational age are important for assessing prenatal growth and predicting postnatal outcomes of newborns. Several countries have developed nation-specific birth weight references for twins, but China still lacks such references.\nBirth weight data for twins born between October 2006 and September 2015 were abstracted from the China National Population-based Birth Defects Surveillance System. A total of 54,786 live twin births aged\u2009\u226528 weeks of gestation without birth defects were included in the analysis. The LMS method was adopted to generate gestational age-specific birth weight percentiles and curves for male and female twins separately. Significant differences were observed between the current reference and other references developed for Chinese or non-Chinese twins. The neonatal mortality rate in this cohort was 12.3\u2030, and much higher rates at very early gestation weeks were identified in small-for-gestational-age twins grouped by the newly developed reference cutoffs.\nThe established birth weight centiles represent the first birth weight norm for contemporary Chinese twins and can be a useful tool to assess growth of twins in clinical and research settings. Key Messages There have been no population-based birth weight percentiles for Chinese twins prior to this study. The established birth weight centiles for female and male twins are markedly lower than those for Chinese singletons. Twin-specific curves should be used for determining inappropriate for gestational age in twins rather than using existing singleton reference. The birth weight percentiles for twins differed significantly from those for non-Chinese twins. In addition to ethnic influences, the observed differences could be ascribed to variations in prenatal care, fetal or maternal nutrition status or other environmental factors. Neonatal mortality rates varied considerably among twins grouped by the newly developed reference percentiles. Small-for-gestational-age twins had much higher mortality than did appropriate-for-gestational-age twins, highlighting the need to reduce postnatal mortality by improving perinatal health care for twins.",

    "abstract": "To compare neonatal outcomes of twins delivered <33 weeks' gestation in tertiary centers in Canada according to the mode of birth and presentation.\nThis retrospective cohort from the Canadian Neonatal Network database studied preterm twins born from 24\u2009+\u20090 to 32\u2009+\u20096 weeks' gestation between 2005 and 2012. Twins were grouped by the mode of birth: both vaginal, combined vaginal/cesarean section (CS), and both CS. Additionally, twins were grouped by the mode of presentation: both vertex, vertex/breech, breech/vertex, and both breech. The primary outcome was a composite of mortality or severe neonatal morbidity (severe neurological injury [intraventricular hemorrhage grade 3/4 or periventricular leukomalacia], bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and necrotizing enterocolitis).\nOf the 6636 twins, 1934 (29%) were delivered vaginally, 418 (6%) by combined vaginal birth/CS, and 4284 (65%) were born by CS. The composite did not differ between the groups. However, severe neurological injury was decreased (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-0.98) and respiratory distress syndrome (AOR, 1.34; 95%CI, 1.15-1.56) was increased when both the twins were delivered by CS.\nPreterm twin infants born via CS experienced less severe neurological injury when compared to those delivered vaginally, but had an increase in respiratory distress syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The preterm birth rate of twins is reportedly higher than that of single pregnancies. We performed preliminary preventive interventions at our center focused on evaluating the risk of each case before 14 weeks of gestation to reduce the spontaneous preterm birth rate.\nThe participants included 184 dichorionic-diamniotic twins delivered at our center during the 8 years from 2006. We evaluated each patient regarding high-risk status (at least 1 additional factor as follows: threatened abortion, history of chorioamnionitis, cervicitis, and bacterial vaginosis), based on available evidence; patients deemed high risk gave their informed consent and underwent treatment for cervicitis and cerclage if indicated. We divided the patients into two groups depending on whether the management was initiated before (Group A) or after (Group B) 14 weeks. We further divided Group A into three: Group 1 underwent treatment for cervicitis, Group 2 underwent cervical cerclage in addition to treatment for cervicitis, and Group 3 did not undergo preventive treatment. We retrospectively compared the preterm birth rates of the two groups, and we also compared them between the higher-risk group (Group 1\u00a0+ 2) and the no additional risk group (Group 3) in Group A.\nThe spontaneous preterm birth rate < 36 weeks was significantly lower in Group A (4/90; 4.4%) than in Group B (18/94; 19.1%) (p=0.001). However, there were no significant differences between Group 1\u00a0+ 2 and Group 3 (2/42 vs. 2/46). Focusing on the spontaneous preterm birth rate < 34 weeks, Group A had a lower rate than Group B (2/90; 2.2% vs. 13/94; 13.8%, p=0.0012).\nEven though this was a preliminary study, the results are promising, and we propose custom-made management for dichorionic-diamniotic twins: (1) earlier management from before 14 weeks; (2) high-risk selection for cervicitis and a short cervix; and (3) intervention with anti-inflammatory agents and cerclage if indicated.",

We present an extremely rare case of conjoined twins in a triplet pregnancy with symmetric thoracoomphalopagus that was diagnosed in prenatal period by using ultrasound scanning and MRI. In triplet pregnancies, we should be aware about the possibility of conjoined twins. If there are severe congenital malformations, termination of pregnancy should be recommended immediately after the diagnosis regardless of gestational age, particularly in early gestational age.",

While the first twin's physical examination proved her to be normal with a pulse rate consistent with her age, the second twin had a pulse rate of approximately 40 beats/minute.The patient was confirmed to have congenital complete atrioventricular block.\nDespite this case appears to be an isolated one, a discordant complete atrioventricular block regression without any autoimmune evidence should be included in the differential diagnosis of bradycardia in infants.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate a novel method to measure circular birefringence (CB) and linear birefringence (LB) present simultaneously in the device under study. By using a \u03c0-shifted Sagnac interferometer, the scheme eliminates the dependence on incoming polarization and on the orientation angle of the linear birefringence. Moreover, due to different handedness symmetry/response of CB and LB to counter-propagating waves, the technique allows us to control the relative influence of the two birefringences leading to a requirement of only two measurements to determine both of them. Thus, comparing to Stokes polarimeters and other methods, our scheme has advantages when characterizing media containing both birefringences. Our findings are experimentally confirmed.",

    "abstract": "Reductions in whole brain and grey matter volumes are robust features of schizophrenia, yet their etiological influences are unclear.\nWe investigated the association between the genetic and environmental risk for schizophrenia and brain volumes. Whole brain, grey matter and white matter volumes were established from structural MRIs from twins varying in their zygosity and concordance for schizophrenia. Hippocampal volumes were measured manually. We conducted between-group testing and full genetic modelling.\nWe included 168 twins in our study. Whole brain, grey matter, white matter and right hippocampal volumes were smaller in twins with schizophrenia. Twin correlations were larger for whole brain, grey matter and white matter volumes in monozygotic than dizygotic twins and were significantly heritable, whereas hippocampal volume was the most environmentally sensitive. There was a significant phenotypic correlation between schizophrenia and reductions in all the brain volumes except for that of the left hippocampus. For whole brain, grey matter and the right hippocampus the etiological links with schizophrenia were principally associated with the shared familial environment. Lower birth weight and perinatal hypoxia were both associated with lower whole brain volume and with lower white matter and grey matter volumes, respectively.\nScan data were collected across 2 sites, and some groups were modest in size.\nWhole brain, grey matter and right hippocampal volume reductions are linked to schizophrenia through correlated familial risk (i.e., the shared familial environment). The degree of influence of etiological factors varies between brain structures, leading to the possibility of a neuroanatomically specific etiological imprint.",

    "abstract": "There are rising rates of multiple births worldwide with associated higher rates of complications and more hospital care, often due to prematurity. While there is strong evidence about the risks of not breastfeeding, rates of breastfeeding in women who have given birth to more than one infant are lower than with singleton births. Breastfeeding more than one infant can be more challenging because of difficulties associated with the birth or prematurity. The extra demands on the mother of frequent suckling, coordinating the needs of more than one infant or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit can lead to delayed initiation or early cessation. Additional options such as breast milk expression, the use of donor milk or different methods of supplementary feeding may be considered. Support and education about breastfeeding has been found to improve the duration of any breastfeeding for healthy term infants and their mothers, however evidence is lacking about interventions that are effective to support women with twins or higher order multiples.\nTo assess effectiveness of breastfeeding education and support for women with twins or higher order multiples.\nWe searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (30 June 2016), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (1 July 2016), the excluded studies list from the equivalent Cochrane review of singletons, and reference lists of retrieved studies.\nRandomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing extra education or support for women with twins or higher order multiples were included.\nTwo review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We planned to assess the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach, but were unable to analyse any data.\nWe found 10 trials (23 reports) of education and support for breastfeeding that included women with twins or higher order multiples. The quality of evidence was mixed, and the risk of bias was mostly high or unclear. It is difficult to blind women or staff to group allocation for this intervention, so in all studies there was high risk of performance and high or unclear risk of detection bias. Trials recruited 5787 women (this included 512 women interviewed as part of a cluster randomised trial); of these, data were available from two studies for 42 women with twins or higher order multiples. None of the interventions were specifically designed for women with more than one infant, and the outcomes for multiples were not reported separately for each infant. Due to the scarcity of evidence and the format in which data were reported, a narrative description of the data is presented, no analyses are presented in this review, and we were unable to GRADE the evidence.The two trials with data for women with multiple births compared home nurse visits versus usual care (15 women), and telephone peer counselling versus usual care (27 women). The number of women who initiated breastfeeding was reported (all 15 women in one study, 25 out of 27 women in one study). Stopping any breastfeeding before four to six weeks postpartum, stopping exclusive breastfeeding before four to six weeks postpartum, stopping any breastfeeding before six months postpartum andstopping exclusive breastfeeding before six months postpartum were not explicitly reported, and there were insufficient data to draw any meaningful conclusions from survival data. Stopping breast milk expression before four to six weeks postpartum, andstopping breast milk expression before six months postpartum were not reported. Measures ofmaternal satisfaction were reported in one study of 15 women, but there were insufficient data to draw any conclusions; no other secondary outcomes were reported for women with multiple births in either study. No adverse events were reported.\nWe found no evidence from randomised controlled trials about the effectiveness of breastfeeding education and support for women with twins or higher order multiples, or the most effective way to provide education and support . There was no evidence about the best way to deliver the intervention, the timing of care, or the best person to deliver the care. There is a need for well-designed, adequately powered studies of interventions designed for women with twins or higher order multiples to find out what types of education and support are effective in helping these mothers to breastfeed their babies.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, it is understood that dizygotic (DZ) twins always have a dichorionic placenta. However, with 8% blood chimerism in DZ twins, placental sharing is probably more common than previously has been recognized. In this article, we will review all available cases of monochorionic dizygotic (MCDZ) twins. A total of 31 twins have been described in literature. A monochorionic diamniotic placenta is reported in all cases. Assisted reproductive technology is responsible for the origin of the pregnancy in 82.1% of the cases. In 15.4% of the sex-discordant twins, a genital anomaly was reported in one of the twins. Chimerism is demonstrable in 90.3% of the twins, leading to various diagnostic difficulties. As this review shows that most MCDZ twins are discovered by accident, it can be argued that it is far more common than has been assumed until now. However, the prevalence is still unclear. Awareness of MCDZ twinning is important, with subsequently correct medical strategies. Similarly, the resulting (blood) chimerism is essential to consider in diagnostic procedures, pre- and postnatally. More research on the effect of placental transfusion between sex-discordant twins is required.",

    "abstract": "X-linked Retinoschisis (XLRS) is one of the most common macular degenerations in young males, with a worldwide prevalence ranging from 1:5000 to 1:20000. Clinical diagnosis of XLRS can be challenging due to the highly variable phenotypic presentation and limited correlation has been identified between mutation type and disease severity or progression.\nWe report the atypical early onset of XLRS in 3-month-old monozygotic twins. Fundus examination was characterized by severe bullous retinal schisis with pre-retinal and intraretinal haemorrhages. Molecular genetic analysis of the RS1 was performed and the c.288G\u2009>\u2009A (p. Trp96Ter) mutation was detected in both patients.\nEarly onset XLRS is associated with a more progressive form of the disease, characterized by large bullous peripheral schisis involving the posterior pole, vascular abnormalities and haemorrhages. The availability of specific technology permitted detailed imaging of the clinical picture of unusual cases of XLRS. The possible relevance of modifying genes should be taken into consideration for the future development of XLRS gene therapy.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between sedentary lifestyle and low back pain (LBP) remains unclear and previous research has not accounted for genetic and early environmental factors.\nOur aim was to investigate if sedentary behavior is associated with the lifetime prevalence of persistent LBP and the risk of developing persistent LBP, care-seeking due to LBP, and activity limiting LBP when genetics and early environmental factors are accounted for.\nBoth cross-sectional and longitudinal designs with a within-pair twin case-control were implemented.\nThere were 2,148 twins included in the cross-sectional analysis whereas 1,098 twins free of persistent LBP at baseline were included in the longitudinal analysis.\nSedentary behavior was the explanatory variable. Lifetime prevalence of LBP was the outcome variable in the cross-sectional analysis. The incidence of persistent LBP, care-seeking due to LBP, and activity limiting LBP were the outcome variables for the longitudinal analysis.\nThis observational study was supported by a grant in 2012. No competing interests were declared.\nIn the cross-sectional analysis, sedentary behavior was slightly associated with an increased prevalence of persistent LBP in females but not in males. This association was not apparent when genetics and early environmental factors were accounted for. We acknowledge that the small sample included in the co-twin analyses have yielded wide confidence intervals, and that caution should be exercised when interpreting and an association may not be ruled out. In the longitudinal analysis, sedentary behavior did not significantly increase the risk of persistent LBP, care-seeking due to LBP, or activity limiting LBP.\nSedentary behavior is associated with concurrent LBP. However, this association is weak; it only appears in females and decreases when accounting for genetics. Future studies using a twin design with larger samples should be conducted to further test these findings.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare, but serious, complication of monozygotic twins. Early prenatal diagnosis of conjoined twins is increasingly made with transvaginal ultrasound and color Doppler studies. Most prenatally diagnosed conjoined twins are terminated due to the high perinatal mortality, but advancement in pediatric surgery has allowed for successful postnatal separation in a small number of cases, and some parents may consider this option over termination of pregnancy. It is important to get a detailed prenatal ultrasound for the site and extent of fusion for an accurate categorization. Three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) provides images that can facilitate counselling for the parents. Additional information that impacts on diagnosis, prognostication, and perinatal management of conjoined twins could be obtained from selective use of 3DUS, particularly those with atypical fetal union. Most of the proposed additional benefits of 3DUS are based on case reports. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been increasingly used for the purpose of identifying intricate organ sharing. Because of the rarity of this condition, and the heterogeneity of fetal fusion, added benefits of either 3DUS or MRI for prenatal diagnosis and perinatal management of conjoined twins have not been demonstrated by well-conducted clinical trials. This article aims to review clinical application of various 3DUS display modes in prenatal assessment of conjoined twins, focusing on their potential additional benefits, risks and misuses. 3DUS may help detecting additional findings that are not possible with 2DUS, but, it has not been scientifically shown to improve the survival rate of the twins or reduce maternal morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Twins are associated with a delayed development and cerebral palsy. The purpose of this work was to compare the neurologic morbidity in very preterm or very low birth weight dichorionic and monochorionic twins with singletons.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of livebirths lowest through 32 weeks of gestation or very low weight infants admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of a level III hospital, between 2006 and 2010. Development was evaluated with the Growing Skills II Scale at 24 months of age. Cerebral palsy was defined by predetermined criteria by Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe. Infants were analyzed as twins and singletons cohort. Within the twin category the infants were further separated as dichorionic and monochorionic and were compared with singletons infants. Logistic regression models were used to control for demographic and clinical factors.\nThe cohort of infants who were assessed for neurodevelopmental impaired, consisted of 194 singletons infants and 89 twins (50 dichorionic; 39 monochorionic). Monochorionic twins, when compared with the singletons, showed an increased risk of severe developmental delay in these areas: locomotion (adjusted OR 12.2) language (adjusted OR 6.5) and autonomy (adjusted OR 7.2). Cerebral palsy was diagnosed in 4.1% of singleton infants and 15.4% of monochorionic twins. The adjusted risk of severe developmental delay and cerebral palsy in monochorionic twins was 3.6 and 4.2, respectively.\nThis work showed higher rate of moderate and severe neurodevelopment delay including cerebral palsy in monochorionic twins compared to singletons infants. Analysis by groups stratified according to gestational age and comparison of monochorionic and dichorionic twins displayed the role of chorionicity for these neurodevelopmental disorders.\nIn our sample the monochorionic twins are associated with an independent risk of neurodevelopmental delay.\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o: Estudos evidenciaram maior taxa de altera\u00e7\u00f5es do neurodesenvolvimento nos g\u00e9meos em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos rec\u00e9m-nascidos\u00a0de gesta\u00e7\u00e3o unifetal. O objetivo deste trabalho foi comparar altera\u00e7\u00f5es do neurodesenvolvimento em g\u00e9meos (monocori\u00f3nicos e\u00a0bicori\u00f3nicos) grandes prematuros ou de muito baixo peso ao nascer, com rec\u00e9m-nascidos de gesta\u00e7\u00e3o unifetal. Material e M\u00e9todos: Estudo retrospetivo de uma coorte de rec\u00e9m-nascidos com idade gestacional inferior a 32 semanas ou peso\u00a0de nascimento inferior a 1500 g, internados na Unidade de Cuidados Intensivos Neonatais, numa maternidade de apoio perinatal\u00a0diferenciado da Regi\u00e3o Centro de Portugal, no per\u00edodo de 2006 a 2010. A avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do neurodesenvolvimento foi realizada aos 24\u00a0meses, com a escala de Growing Skills II. No diagn\u00f3stico de paralisia cerebral usou-se a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o internacional de Surveillance of\u00a0Cerebral Palsy in Europe. Foram comparados rec\u00e9m-nascidos de gesta\u00e7\u00e3o unifetal com rec\u00e9m-nascidos de gravidez m\u00faltipla e com os\u00a0subgrupos: monocori\u00f3nicos e bicori\u00f3nicos. An\u00e1lise estat\u00edstica pelo SPSS vers\u00e3o 20.0. Foi aplicado um modelo de regress\u00e3o log\u00edstica. Resultados: Foram avaliados 194 rec\u00e9m-nascidos do grupo gesta\u00e7\u00e3o unifetal e 89 g\u00e9meos - 50 bicori\u00f3nicos e 39 monocori\u00f3nicos.\u00a0Os g\u00e9meos monocori\u00f3nicos apresentaram maior risco, em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao grupo de gesta\u00e7\u00e3o unifetal, de altera\u00e7\u00f5es moderadas a graves\u00a0do neurodesenvolvimento global (OR ajustado 3,6) e nas sub\u00e1reas: locomo\u00e7\u00e3o (OR ajustado 12,2) linguagem (OR ajustado 6,5) e autonomia\u00a0(OR ajustado 7,2). A paralisia cerebral foi diagnosticada em 15,4% dos g\u00e9meos monocori\u00f3nicos e 4,1% de gesta\u00e7\u00e3o unifetal(OR ajustado 4,2). Discuss\u00e3o: Este trabalho evidenciou taxa superior de altera\u00e7\u00f5es moderadas a graves do neurodesenvolvimento, incluindo a paralisia\u00a0cerebral nos g\u00e9meos monocori\u00f3nicos em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao grupo de gesta\u00e7\u00e3o unifetal.

    "abstract": "Cold dissection (CD) and bipolar cautery dissection (BCD) techniques are two common surgical tonsillectomy procedures used in the clinic. Obstruction has become more prevalent as the major surgical indication and is most prominently observed in younger children.\nIn this report, we aimed to explain the abovementioned surgical techniques in detail and compare the results in identical twins (monozygote twins). Using low energy electrocautery, irrigating the operation site continuously during cauterization, avoiding unnecessary sutures, and direct cautery to the tonsil bed are all effective measures that have diminished post-op pain in bipolar electrocautery dissection, compared to cold dissection tonsillectomy.\nBipolar cautery dissection with some modification is very good alternative for tonsillar surgery.",

    "abstract": "Economics offers an analytical framework to consider human behaviour including religious behaviour. Within the realm of Expected Utility Theory, religious belief and activity could be interpreted as an insurance both for current life events and for afterlife rewards. Based on that framework, we would expect that risk averse individuals would demand a more generous protection plan which they may do by devoting more effort and resources into religious activities such as church attendance and prayer, which seems to be in accordance with previous empirical results. However, a general concern regards the problems of spurious correlations due to underlying omitted or unobservable characteristics shaping both religious activities and risk attitudes. This paper examines empirically the demand for religion by analysing the association between risk attitudes on the one hand, and church attandance and prayer frequency on the other controlling for unobservable variables using survey data of Danish same-sex twin pairs. We verify the correlation between risk preferences and religion found previously by carrying out cross-sectional analyses. We also show that the association between risk attitudes and religious behaviour is driven by the subgroup of individuals who believe in an afterlife. In addition, when re-analysing our results using panel data analyses which cancel out shared factors among twin pairs, we find that the correlation found between risk aversion and religious behaviour is no longer significant indicating that other factors might explain differences in religious behaviour. Caution is needed in the interpretation of our results as the insignificant association between risk aversion and religious behaviour in the panel data analyses potentially might be due to measurement error causing attenuation bias or lack of variation within twin pairs rather than the actual absence of an association.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have examined the potentially reduced life expectancy associated with spinal pain (i.e. low back and neck pain) in an ageing population, particularly after controlling for familial factors, including genetics.\nWe investigated whether spinal pain increased the rate of all-cause and disease-specific cardiovascular mortality in older Danish twins aged \u226570\u00a0years. Data from 4391 participants collected at baseline were linked with the Danish Cause of Death Registry with the study ending on 31 December 2014. Two crude and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analyses determined the rate of all-cause and disease-specific cardiovascular mortality by baseline spinal pain exposure; unpaired (total sample analysis) and twin pair (intra-pair analysis). Analyses were also adjusted for confounders; baseline physical functional ability and depressive symptoms. Competing risk regression models determined the rate of cardiovascular mortality, adjusting for similar confounders and using the total sample only.\nSpinal pain was associated with an increased rate of all-cause mortality, hazard ratio (HR): 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.21]. There was no association between spinal pain and cardiovascular disease mortality, sub-distribution hazard ratio (SHR): 1.08 [95% CI 0.96-1.21]. After adjusting for confounders (physical functional ability and depressive symptoms), the association became non-significant. All intra-pair analyses were statistically non-significant, although greater in magnitude for monozygotic twins.\nOlder people reporting spinal pain have 13% increased risk of mortality per years lived but the connection is not causal. We found no association between spinal pain and cardiovascular-specific mortality. The influence of shared familial factors is unlikely.\nOlder people reporting spinal pain have 13% increased risk of mortality per year lived. However, this association is not likely to be causal, with the relevant confounders contributing to this relationship. Thus, pain in the spine may be part of a pattern of poor health, which increases mortality risk in the older population.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have hypothesized that cloacal exstrophy may be caused by errors early in embryological development related to monozygotic twinning. This study reports the prevalence of twins in a large cohort of patients with cloacal exstrophy.\nPatients with cloacal exstrophy treated 1974-2015 were reviewed for reports of multiple gestation or conjoined twinning. The genetic sex of the patient and their twin, and any mention of anomaly in the twin were recorded. Neither placental exam nor genetic testing results were available to definitively determine zygosity.\nOf 71 patients, 10 had a live born twin (14%), all of whom were of the same genetic sex as the affected patient. One additional patient's twin suffered intrauterine fetal demise, and another patient had a conjoined heteropagus twin. None of the twins were affected by exstrophy-epispadias complex. The rate of twin birth in this cohort was 4.4-7.7 higher than that reported by the Centers for Disease Control in the general population time period (P<0.001), with a striking preponderance of same-sex pairs.\nThe highly significant prevalence of same-sex twin pairs within this cohort supports the hypothesis that the embryogenesis of cloacal exstrophy may be related to errors in monozygotic twinning.\n2b.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are suggested to result from aberrant embryogenesis. The two main theories proposed to explain the phenomena are fission and fusion. The incidence rate is 1 in 50,000 births; however, since about 60% of the cases are stillborn, the true incidence is approximated at 1 in 200,000. There is a higher predisposition towards female than male gender with a ratio of 3:1. Conjoined twins are classified based upon the site of attachment. The extent of organ sharing, especially the heart, determines the possibility and prognosis of a separation procedure. Meticulous preoperative evaluation, planning, and preparedness of the team are crucial for a successful separation. Separation of conjoined twins poses several technical, legal, and ethical issues.

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins fused at the thorax display an enigmatic left-right defect: although left twins are normal, laterality is disturbed in one-half of right twins [1-3]. Molecularly, this randomization corresponds to a lack of asymmetric Nodal cascade induction in right twins [4]. We studied leftward flow [5, 6] at the left-right organizer (LRO) [7, 8] in thoracopagus twins in Xenopus, which displayed a duplicated, fused, and ciliated LRO. Cilia were motile and produced a leftward flow from the right LRO margin of the right to the left margin of the left twin. Motility was required for correct laterality in left twins, as knockdown of dynein motor dnah9 prevented Nodal cascade induction. Nodal was rescued by parallel knockdown of the inhibitor dand5 [9, 10] on the left side of the left twin. Lack of Nodal induction in the right twin, despite the presence of flow, was due to insufficient suppression of dand5. Knockdown of dand5 at the center of the fused LRO resulted in asymmetric Nodal cascade induction in the right twin as well. Manipulation of leftward flow and dand5 in a targeted and sided manner induced the Nodal cascade in a predictable manner, in the left twin, the right one, both, or neither. Laterality in conjoined twins thus was determined by cilia-driven leftward fluid flow like in single embryos, which solves a century-old riddle, as the phenomenon was already studied by some of the founders of experimental embryology, including Dareste [11], Fol and Warynsky [12], and Spemann and Falkenberg [13] (reviewed in [14]).",

    "abstract": "Although renal impairment is a rare complication of ulcerative colitis (UC), interstitial nephritis can occur as an idiosyncratic reaction to 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) treatment for UC. Monozygotic twins developed UC at ages 49 and 51, and they were separately treated at different medical institutes. They did not know that they had the same disease and were treated with the same drug (5-ASA). During the course of 5-ASA treatment, renal impairment diagnosed as interstitial nephritis occurred in both. Granulocyte/monocyte adsorption was initiated, UC remission was achieved and renal function deterioration subsided in both. Drug or treatment responses may be concordant in monozygotic twins with UC. Careful review is important before treatment to avoid serious adverse events.",

    "abstract": "Although the birth of twins has always attracted attention, there are no known genetic or environmental factors that can determine the birth of monozygotic (MZ) twins. And even for dizygotic (DZ) twins, genetic influences are not completely understood. A previous study from our group has shown that the C allele of polymorphism rs1042522 in the TP53 gene was more frequent in the mothers of twins than in the mothers of singletons in a small village in South Brazil. In order to clarify whether this was an isolated factor, we performed a population-based, observational case-control study. Samples were selected from a state-funded program of paternity investigation. Samples were considered cases when two of the children had the same date of birth, whereas controls were those samples in which at least two children were born in different dates. The first subsequent sample fulfilling control criteria was included after each case. From 2007 to 2013, 32,661 records were searched and 283 (0.9%) twins were found (119 MZ and 164 DZ). Genotypic and allele frequencies were not different between mothers of twins or mothers of singletons. However, mothers of MZ twins showed a higher frequency of GG genotype and lower frequency of the C allele when compared to mothers of DZ twins. Also, the proportion of MZ twins (42%) was higher than usually reported (30%). Finally, the proportion of twins found in this study seems to be more realistic, as this sample was allegedly not from users of assisted reproduction techniques.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether cervical pessary placement prevents preterm birth (PTB) in twin gestations with a short mid-trimester cervical length (CL) on transvaginal sonography (TVS).\nThis was a multicenter randomized controlled trial of asymptomatic women with a twin gestation and a TVS-CL of \u2264\u200930\u2009mm at 18\u2009+\u20090 to 27\u2009+\u20096\u2009weeks' gestation. TVS-CL was measured at the time of the fetal anatomy scan at 18\u2009+\u20090 to 23\u2009+\u20096\u2009weeks and at subsequent scheduled ultrasound scans prior to 28 weeks. Women with a TVS-CL of \u2264\u200930\u2009mm at 18\u2009+\u20090 to 27\u2009+\u20096\u2009weeks were randomized to receive either the Bioteque\u2122 cup cervical pessary or no pessary. Randomization was stratified by gestational age, study site and chorionicity. Women with a monoamniotic twin gestation, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, early selective intrauterine growth restriction or placenta previa were excluded. Cervical pessaries were inserted by maternal-fetal medicine staff centrally trained in proper placement. No other treatment for women with a short cervix was recommended. Primary outcome was PTB <\u200934\u2009weeks. The trial was stopped early before complete enrollment.\nA total of 421 women with a twin gestation were screened for TVS-CL, and 85 (20%) had a TVS-CL of \u2264\u200930\u2009mm. Of these, 80 (94%) met the eligibility criteria and 46 (58%) of the eligible women agreed to randomization. Twenty-three (50%) women were randomized to pessary placement and 23 (50%) to no pessary. Demographic characteristics, including median gestational age (21.0 vs 21.2\u2009weeks; P\u2009=\u20090.69) and TVS-CL (16.7 vs 22.9\u2009mm; P\u2009=\u20090.45) at randomization, were similar between the pessary and no-pessary groups, except for level of education (more than high school education: 48% vs 78%, respectively; P\u2009=\u20090.03) and proportion of spontaneous conceptions (83% vs 43%, respectively; P\u2009=\u20090.01). There were no significant differences between the pessary and no-pessary groups in rate of primary outcome, PTB <\u200934\u2009weeks (39% vs 35%; relative risk, 1.13 (95% CI, 0.53-2.40)), as well as other outcomes, including PTB <\u200937\u2009weeks and <\u200928\u2009weeks, gestational age at delivery, birth weight and composite adverse neonatal outcome.\nTreatment with cervical pessary was not associated with the prevention of PTB in women with a twin gestation and a mid-trimester TVS-CL of \u2264\u200930\u2009mm in this small underpowered randomized controlled trial.

    "abstract": "The environmental contributions to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their informative content for diagnosing the condition are still largely unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate associations between early medical events and ASD, as well as autistic traits, in twins, to test the hypothesis of a cumulative environmental effect on ASD risk. A total of 80 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs (including a rare sample of 13 twin pairs discordant for clinical ASD) and 46 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs with varying autistic traits, were examined for intra-pair differences in early medical events (for example, obstetric and neonatal factors, first year infections). First, differences in early medical events were investigated using multisource medical records in pairs qualitatively discordant for ASD. The significant intra-pair differences identified were then tested in relation to autistic traits in the remaining sample of 100 pairs, applying generalized estimating equations analyses. Significant association of the intra-pair differences in the MZ pairs were found for the cumulative load of early medical events and clinical ASD (Z=-2.85, P=0.004) and autistic traits (\u03b2=78.18, P=0.002), as well as infant dysregulation (feeding, sleeping abnormalities, excessive crying and worriedness), when controlling for intelligence quotient and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder comorbidity. The cumulative load of early medical events in general, and infant dysregulation in particular, may index children at risk of ASD owing to non-shared environmental contributions. In clinical practice, these findings may facilitate screening and early detection of ASD.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins occur at low frequency in all vertebrates including humans. Many twins fused at the chest or abdomen display a very peculiar laterality defect: while the left twin is normal with respect to asymmetric organ morphogenesis and placement (situs solitus), the organ situs is randomized in right twins. Although this phenomenon has fascinated already some of the founders of experimental embryology in the 19th and early 20th century, such as Dareste, Fol, Warynsky and Spemann, its embryological basis has remained enigmatic. Here we summarize historical experiments and interpretations as well as current models, argue that the frog Xenopus is the only vertebrate model organism to tackle the issue, and outline suitable experiments to address the question of twin laterality in the context of cilia-based symmetry breakage.",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of contrasting color perceptions of \"the dress\" photograph has gained scientific interest. The mechanism underlying why individuals differ is yet to be fully explained. We use the powerful twin model design to ascertain the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors on perception variation. A sample of 466 twins from the British TwinsUK registry were invited to report what color they saw in a standard image of the dress in standard illumination. The mean age of the participants was 49.5 (SD = 17.8) years, and 85% were female. When asked to choose between white and gold (WG) or blue and black (BB), 328 reported WG (70.4%) and 135 (29.0%) reported BB. Subjects choosing WG were significantly older (p < 0.01), but there was no significant difference in gender. Monozygotic (MZ) twins were more concordant in their responses than dizygotic (DZ) twins (0.46 vs. 0.36). Twin modeling revealed that genetic factors accounted for 34% (95% confidence interval, 5%-59%) of variation in the reported color of the dress when adjusted for age, whereas environmental factors contributed 66% (95% CI, 41%-95%). This study suggests environmental factors play a significant role in how an individual perceives the color of \"the dress.\"",

    "abstract": "LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) remains the primary goal for hypolipidemic therapy as a representative of atherogenic LDL particles. In patients at very high risk, its level should be in the range 0.9-1.6 mmol/l. In patients with progression of atherosclerosis despite treatment, an important role could play high level of lipoprotein (a) - Lp(a), particle with a high atherothrombotic potential. Until now, it was difficult to reduce LDL-C to the desired range by recent therapy: combination of lifestyle changes, high doses of strong statins and ezetimibe. Lp(a) was not affected by these measures at all. Recently, we have the opportunity to reduce significantly LDLc and Lp(a), by two treatment modalities. The first is a lipoprotein apheresis that reduces LDL-C and Lp(a) by 60-80 %. The second one are inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 which lower LDL-C similarly to lipoprotein apheresis; Lp(a), approximately by 25 %. Both methods, or their combination could, therefore, significantly affect prognosis of patients with atherosclerosis out of control, in which the treatment by available therapy have not been successful or not possible for intolerance especially in the case of statins.Key words: LDL cholesterol - lipoprotein (a) - lipoprotein apheresis - PCSK9 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic variants in theP21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase 3gene (PAK3) lead to a rare non syndromic X-linked intellectual disability. The protein encoded by this gene forms an activated complex with GTP-bound RAS-like (P21), CDC2 and RAC1 proteins which then mediates a variety of cellular processes. So far, mutations in PAK3 gene have been reported in few families affected with intellectual disability associated with neurological manifestations such as speech defect, behavioral problem, brain structural abnormalities, microcephaly and cerebral palsy. In this study whole exome sequencing revealed a de novo likely pathogenic variant in PAK3 gene in monozygotic twins presented with intellectual disability, speech delay, behavioral problems and macrocephaly. Macrocephaly was noticed in our patients from birth at 35 weeks of gestation. This aspect of the phenotype has not been previously reported in other documented cases with pathogenic mutations in PAK3 gene. Our findings extend the phenotype of this disorder to include macrocephaly and offers further clues to the importance of the serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (PAK3) protein in brain development and function.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins with near-identical genotypes and discordance for complex diseases represent an exceptional resource to ascertain disease etiology. This strategy has been particularly effective with the availability of high-resolution complete individual genome sequencing. The challenge is using effective approaches to identify relevant differences that may cause or contribute toward disease discordance.\nThis study carried out a VarScan2 bioinformatic analysis and a pathway analysis on whole-genome sequences from two sets of monozygotic twins.\nVariants were identified that were present in the affected twin, but not found in the unaffected twin. Such variations are expected to be de novo and originate during the independent development of the twins and may make them discordant for the disease. The genes and de novo variants identified in this experiment are compatible with their involvement in schizophrenia. Further analysis of the variants identified pathways including glutamate receptor signaling that have been implicated in this neurodevelopmental disease.\nThe results support the polygenic nature of schizophrenia and the threshold model for its development. The results also show the effectiveness of VarScan2 to identify 'the needle in the hay stack' that may cause schizophrenia, specifically in the two patients. It offers a proof of principle for assessment of the genetic etiology of complex disorders where discordance of monozygotic twins is an established phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Dietary fat intake is correlated with increased insulin resistance (IR). However, it is unknown whether gene-diet interaction modulates the association. This study estimated heritability of IR measures and the related genetic correlations with fat intake, and tested whether dietary fat intake modifies the genetic influence on type 2 diabetes (T2D)-related traits in Chinese child twins. We included 622 twins aged 7-15 years (n 311 pairs, 162 monozygotic (MZ), 149 dizygotic (DZ)) from south-eastern China. Dietary factors were measured using FFQ. Structural equation models were fit using Mx statistical package. The intra-class correlation coefficients for all traits related to T2D were higher for MZ twins than for DZ twins. Dietary fat and fasting serum insulin (additive genetic correlation (r A) 0\u00b720; 95 % CI 0\u00b708, 0\u00b743), glucose (r A 0\u00b712; 95 % CI 0\u00b701, 0\u00b740), homoeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (Homa-IR) (r A 0\u00b722; 95 % CI 0\u00b710, 0\u00b750) and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (Quicki) (r A -0\u00b722; 95 % CI -0\u00b740, 0\u00b704) showed strong genetic correlations. Heritabilities of dietary fat intake, fasting glucose and insulin were estimated to be 52, 70 and 70 %, respectively. More than 70 % of the phenotypic correlations between dietary fat and insulin, glucose, Homa-IR and the Quicki index appeared to be mediated by shared genetic influence. Dietary fat significantly modified additive genetic effects on these quantitative traits associated with T2D. Analysis of Chinese twins yielded high estimates of heritability of dietary fat intake and IR. Genetic factors appear to contribute to a high proportion of the variance for both insulin sensitivity and IR. Dietary fat intake modifies the genetic influence on blood levels of insulin and glucose, Homa-IR and the Quicki index.",

The present study aims to investigate whether TPO-Abs (1) are stable over time, (2) are associated with lithium-exposure, (3) share a common genetic background with BD and are related to psychopathology.\nIn bipolar offspring and twins, the prevalence of TPO-Abs is stable over time (r \nAlthough our results show a trend toward an increased inherited risk of the co-occurrence of BD and thyroid autoimmunity, large-scale studies can only draw final conclusions.

    "abstract": "Although the correlation between cognition and physical function has been well studied in the general population, the genetic and environmental nature of the correlation has been rarely investigated. We conducted a classical twin analysis on cognitive and physical function, including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), handgrip strength, five-times-sit-to-stand test (FTSST), near visual acuity, and number of teeth lost in 379 complete twin pairs. Bivariate twin models were fitted to estimate the genetic and environmental correlation between physical and cognitive function. Bivariate analysis showed mildly positively genetic correlations between cognition and FEV1, r G = 0.23 [95% CI: 0.03, 0.62], as well as FVC, r G = 0.35 [95% CI: 0.06, 1.00]. We found that FTSST and cognition presented very high common environmental correlation, r C = -1.00 [95% CI: -1.00, -0.57], and low but significant unique environmental correlation, r E = -0.11 [95% CI: -0.22, -0.01], all in the negative direction. Meanwhile, near visual acuity and cognition also showed unique environmental correlation, r E = 0.16 [95% CI: 0.03, 0.27]. We found no significantly genetic correlation for cognition with handgrip strength, FTSST, near visual acuity, and number of teeth lost. Cognitive function was genetically related to pulmonary function. The FTSST and cognition shared almost the same common environmental factors but only part of the unique environmental factors, both with negative correlation. In contrast, near visual acuity and cognition may positively share part of the unique environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors, which play a major role in the prevalence of early childhood caries (ECC), can help clinicians with planning a long-term preventive treatment. The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence and heritability of ECC among monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins in Chennai, India, in the year 2013. A cross-sectional study was designed to estimate the prevalence of ECC among twins. Zygosity classification for the survey framework was adapted from a highly accurate parental report questionnaire pertaining to the physical similarity between twins. The associated heritability index was estimated. The Decayed, Missing, Filled Surface (DMFS) Index was used as the diagnostic criterion for dental caries. The prevalence of ECC was estimated at 18.7%. The correlation coefficient between the twin pair showed significant correlation. The heritability index for ECC was estimated at 15% higher prevalence of ECC found among children in the age group 25-36 months. The heritability estimate indicated a relatively low genetic influence for early childhood caries among twins. There was no significant difference detected in the concordance rate for the MZ and DZ twins. Further research could be directed toward the prevalence of ECC among higher age group children to explore the role of genetic and environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with blood pressure (BP), but the associations between different obesity indicators and BP have not reached agreement. Besides, both obesity and BP are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Whether they share the same genetic or environmental etiology has not been fully understood. We therefore analyzed the relationship between different obesity indicators and BP components as well as the genetic and environmental contributions to these relationships in a Chinese adult twin sample. Twins aged 18-79 years (n = 941) were included in this study. Body mass index (BMI) was used as the index of general obesity, whereas waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were used as the indicators of central obesity. BP components included systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Linear regression models and bivariate structural equation models were used to examine the relation of various obesity indicators with BP components, and genetic or environmental influences on these associations, respectively. A strong association of BP components with BMI-and a somewhat weaker association with WC, WHtR, and WHR-was found in both sexes, independent of familial factors. Of these phenotypic correlations between obesity indicators and BP components, 60-76% were attributed to genetic factors, whereas 24-40% were attributed to unique environmental factors. General obesity was most strongly associated with high BP in Chinese adult twins. There were common genetic backgrounds for obesity and BP, and unique environmental factors also played a role.",

    "abstract": "Due to the high number of multiple embryo transfers into the uterus performed in assisted reproductive technology treatment (ART), the incidences of twin pregnancy and of vanishing twin syndrome (VTS) are correspondingly high. A number of studies have described the obstetric outcomes of the remaining fetus produced after the other twin had vanished compared with a singleton at the start following ART, but the results are mixed and contradictory. We performed a systematic review of the existing studies to explore the actual obstetric outcome of VTS to allow physicians to adequately advise their patients.\nA detailed search strategy was used to conduct electronic literature searches (spanning 1978-2015) on Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane library and Web of Science. As randomized trials are not feasible in this aspect, we included observational (cohort and case-control) studies which compared the obstetric outcomes of the VTS group and singleton at the start control group after ART. The outcomes were evaluated by two aspects, the duration of pregnancy (gestational age, preterm delivery rate, extremely preterm delivery rate) and the birth weight of the fetus [mean birth weight, low birth weight rate, very low birth weight rate and small for gestational age (SGA)].\n1271 publications were identified by the initial search. 499 studies were excluded following duplication checks. 760 were excluded after reviewing the abstracts. Of the remaining 12 articles, 7 were excluded after a detailed full-text review. Two case-control studies and three cohort studies were included in the final analysis. The pooled mean gestational age difference (95% confidence intervals) was -0.27 (-0.60, 0.06) and failed to demonstrate a difference between the two groups. A similar result was found in the preterm delivery rate, with a pooled risk ratio of 1.33 (0.91, 1.94). The prevalence of extremely preterm delivery rate was higher in the VTS group, with a pooled risk ratio of 3.5 (1.72, 7.12). The mean birth weight was lower in the VTS group, with a mean difference of -0.3 (-0.59, -0.01). No difference was found in low birth weight rate, very low birth weight rate and rate of small for gestational age, with risk ratio of 1.85 (0.88, 3.86), 4.86 (0.91, 25.91) and 1.29 (0.52, 3.18), correspondingly.\nThere is a slight adverse effect of VTS on the remaining fetus for birth weight and extremely preterm delivery rate, but sensitivity analysis shows these effects to be statistically unstable. It is too early to draw conclusions for adverse obstetric outcomes for VTS patients. It could reduce much of the anxiety of couples who experience early embryonic loss of one of their twins. More research with rigorously designed and standardized methodologies are required that include larger, better clinically defined populations. Studies that show no correlation should be published in the future to avoid any possible impact of publication bias. After that, patients can receive the most accurate information.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that human and other mammalian breast milk may be tailored for the sex of the offspring. Such sex bias suggests that opposite-sex twins, who receive breast milk that cannot simultaneously be tailored for both sexes, may be at a disadvantage for growth compared with same-sex twins. An analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) shows that, controlling for sex, age, birth weight, and zygosity, breastfed same-sex twins are, on average, about 1 inch taller and 12 pounds heavier than their opposite-sex counterparts through adolescence and early adulthood. In contrast, never-breastfed same-sex twins tend to be shorter and lighter than their opposite-sex counterparts. These results may be potential evidence for sex bias in human breast milk and its long-term effects.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the factors that influence breastfeeding throughout the hospital stay, including prenatal preparation, early skin-to-skin contact directly after delivery, rooming-in, feeding before the first breastfeed, time to first breastfeed, and postpartum support. This study also aimed to verify whether these factors were significant after adjusting for the mother's characteristics, the newborn's characteristics, and the delivery characteristics.\nA retrospective survey was used to collect the data. Factors that influenced breastfeeding throughout the hospital stay, and differences between the types of newborns were analyzed.\nAmong twins, a higher likelihood of breastfeeding throughout the hospital stay was associated with not feeding before the first breastfeeding and an earlier start time for the first breastfeeding. Among singletons, a higher likelihood of breastfeeding throughout the hospital stay was associated with early skin-to-skin contact, no other feeding before the first breastfeed, and an earlier commencement of the first breastfeed.\nEffort should encourage early breastfeeding, without restriction, to improve the breastfeeding rate among mothers of twins. Moreover, an individualized approach that addresses the factors that influence breastfeeding for each type of newborn may help improve the corresponding rates of breastfeeding throughout the hospital stay.",

    "abstract": "Widely found in metals, semiconductors, oxides, and even organic materials, multiple twinning has important implications in engineering applications of materials. In this work, the intrinsic strain in 5-fold twins of diamond and silicon has been studied combining aberration-corrected electron microscopy and first-principles calculations. In contrast to metallic 5-fold twins, where the strain distribution is relatively smooth, the semiconductor systems show significant strain concentration at the twin boundaries, which is shear modulus dependent. In silicon with moderate strain concentration, the electronic frontier orbitals are located at the center of the 5-fold twins. Accompanying the increased strain concentration in diamond, however, the frontier orbitals are pushed to the surface. The modification of strain state and surface electronic structure by materials elasticity suggest possible routes to tune catalytic, electronic, and mechanical properties of materials.",

    "abstract": "Twin gestations are at significantly higher risk of fetal growth restriction in comparison with singletons. Using fetal biometric charts customized for obstetrical and parental characteristics may facilitate an accurate assessment of fetal growth.\nThe objective of the study was to construct reference charts for the gestation of fetal biometric parameters stratified by chorionicity and customized for obstetrical and parental characteristics.\nFetal biometric measurements obtained from serial ultrasound examinations in uncomplicated twin pregnancies delivering after 36 weeks of gestation were collected by 19 Italian fetal medicine units under the auspices of the Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Ecografia Ostetrica e Ginecologica. The measurements acquired in each fetus at each examination included biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length. Multilevel linear regression models were used to adjust for the serial ultrasonographic measurements obtained and the clustering of each fetus in twin pregnancy. The impact of maternal and paternal characteristics (height, weight, ethnicity), parity, fetal sex, and mode of conception was also considered. Models for each parameter were stratified by fetal chorionicity and compared with our previously constructed growth curves for singletons.\nThe data set included 1781 twin pregnancies (dichorionic, n\u00a0= 1289; monochorionic diamniotic, n\u00a0= 492) with 8923 ultrasonographic examinations with a median of 5 (range, 2-8) observations per pregnancy in dichorionic and 6 in (range, 2-11) monochorionic pregnancies. Growth curves of twin pregnancies differed from those of singletons, and differences were more marked in monochorionic twins and during the third trimester. A significant influence of parental characteristics was found.\nCurves of fetal biometric measurements in twins are influenced by parental characteristics. There is a reduction in the growth rate during the third trimester. The reference limits for gestation constructed in this study may provide a useful tool for a more accurate assessment of fetal growth in twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Craniosynostosis, or premature fusion of the cranial sutures, occurs in approximately 1 in 2500 live births. The genetic causes and molecular basis of these disorders have greatly expanded over the last 2 decades, with numerous causative and contributory mutations having been identified. The role of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) mutations in the etiology of certain eponymous forms of craniosynostosis is now well elucidated; the most common syndromes associated with craniosynostosis are Pfeifer (FGFR1, FGFR2), Apert (FGFR2), Crouzon (FGFR2), Saethre-Chotzen (TWIST1), Jackson-Weiss (FGFR2), Greig (GL13), and Muenke (FGFR3) syndromes. Although pathological expression of these mutations often results in bilateral coronal craniosynostosis, single suture fusions (typically unilateral coronal synostosis) or multiple suture craniosynostosis are possible.The majority of patients diagnosed with craniosynostosis lack an identifiable syndrome or genetic mutation. The etiopathogenesis of these \"nonsyndromic\" forms of craniosynostosis is believed to involve a complex interplay of genetics, epigenetics, and environmental factors. Evaluation of genes implicated in nonsyndromic craniosynostosis has been conflicting; some evidence demonstrates an interplay between genetic and epigenetic influences while others do not. Certain environmental factors such as teratogenic levels of retinoic acid, maternal metabolic and hematologic disorders, and head growth constraint in utero may increase the likelihood of developing craniosynostosis, but these associations are again tenuous.The authors present 1 of 2 genetically confirmed identical twins discordant for metopic craniosynostosis. The implications of this case are clear: epigenetic influences, environmental influences, or both played a role in the development of this premature suture fusion.",

    "abstract": "Background - Neonatal lupus erythematosus is an uncommon acquired autoimmune disease caused by transplacental passage of maternal antibodies SSA/Ro, SSB/La or U1 ribonucleoproteins. The most common clinical manifestations are skin rash, cardiac lesions, thrombocytopenia, anemia and hepatosplenomegaly. Complete congenital heart block is usually irreversible needing a pacemaker implantation in two-thirds of cases. Cases report - We report neonatal lupus erythematosus with complete congenital heart block in twins. Newborns were delivered by caesarean section at week 38 of gestation with a heart rate regular at 70 beats per minute. Both twins and mother were positive for antinuclear, anti-SSA, and anti-SSB antibodies. Twins received single-chamber pacemaker implants at day 12 of life. The evolution was immediately favorable with a heart rate around 110 beats per minute. The follow-up was 2 years. The twins are currently asymptomatic. Conclusion - Complete congenital heart block is the most serious manifestation of the neonatal lupus erythematosus associated with significant morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Heteropagus twins are an extremely rare event with an incidence of 1-2 million live births that represents, sometimes, a real challenge for paediatric surgeons. The majority of cases have complete or partial duplication of the pelvis and/or lower extremities. Thoracic heteropagus conjoined twins is a rare condition in which a grossly defective foetus (the parasite) is attached to the thorax of the main foetus (the autosite). We describe a case of a parasitic heteropagus attached at the chest wall with a rare presentation of giant exomphalos on the autosite. In this situation, the separation procedure was simple after a well-done anatomic study using X-ray, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance and echocardiogram are performed.",

    "abstract": "Detection and evaluation of the mismatch between the intended and actually obtained result of an action (reward prediction error) is an integral component of adaptive self-regulation of behavior. Extensive human and animal research has shown that evaluation of action outcome is supported by a distributed network of brain regions in which the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a central role, and the integration of distant brain regions into a unified feedback-processing network is enabled by long-range phase synchronization of cortical oscillations in the theta band. Neural correlates of feedback processing are associated with individual differences in normal and abnormal behavior, however, little is known about the role of genetic factors in the cerebral mechanisms of feedback processing. Here we examined genetic influences on functional cortical connectivity related to prediction error in young adult twins (age 18, n=399) using event-related EEG phase coherence analysis in a monetary gambling task. To identify prediction error-specific connectivity pattern, we compared responses to loss and gain feedback. Monetary loss produced a significant increase of theta-band synchronization between the frontal midline region and widespread areas of the scalp, particularly parietal areas, whereas gain resulted in increased synchrony primarily within the posterior regions. Genetic analyses showed significant heritability of frontoparietal theta phase synchronization (24 to 46%), suggesting that individual differences in large-scale network dynamics are under substantial genetic control. We conclude that theta-band synchronization of brain oscillations related to negative feedback reflects genetically transmitted differences in the neural mechanisms of feedback processing. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence for genetic influences on task-related functional brain connectivity assessed using direct real-time measures of neuronal synchronization.",

The authors aimed to compare decorin (DCN) and oxidative/antioxidative state levels between the placentas of discordant and concordant twins.\nProspective study of 43 spontaneous DD twin pregnancies included and placentas samples taken from each twin and prepared for homogenization. Total oxidant/antioxidant status levels in placental tissue were determined by automated colorimetric method. Decorin levels were detected by using ELISA method; 23 of these were discordant and 20 of them were concordant.\nDCN levels in the placentas of the low birth-weight twins were significantly lower than the levels of the placentas of appropriate gestational age twins (p = 0.006). There were no statistically significant differences in total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), or arylesterase (ARES) levels in discordant (p = 0.631, p = 0.370, and p = 0.079, respectively) and in the placental DCN, TAS, TOS, or ARES levels of the concordant twins (p = 0.407, p = 0.035, p = 0.194, and p = 0.979, respectively). When the authors compared the twins of similar birth weight, the DCN, TAS, and TOS levels were significantly lower in the discordant twins (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.002, respectively).\nDecreased levels of DCN in discordant twin fetuses compared to the same birth weight-concordant twins shows that it contributes to disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "To demonstrate that it is important to consider all possibilities when confronted with a decision to terminate a pregnancy because it is likely to be chromosomally abnormal.\nA cell free DNA test was performed on a woman with dichorionic diamniotic twins that followed the transfer of a single embryo.\nThe cell free DNA test was consistent with trisomy 21. Two perinatologists favored identical twins and thus suggested termination since both twins would be trisomy 21 and the couple did not want to raise a child with Down's syndrome. Our group suggested the possibility that these were fraternal twins with one occurring from natural conception. We suggested to forego termination by D&E but to undergo an amniocentesis at 16 weeks. One twin had obvious cardiac abnormalities by ultrasound and this one was reduced while amniocentesis with karyotype was performed on fetus 2. The results showed a normal male.\nOne should consider all possibilities before suggesting termination of a very desired pregnancy. This woman had also been advised by other specialists in reproductive endocrinology that conception with her own oocytes (as did occur here) was not possible and she should consider donor oocytes based on her marked diminished oocyte reserve.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are debilitating psychiatric disorders with partially shared symptomatology including psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment. Aberrant levels of microglia and neurodegenerative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers have previously been found in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We aimed to analyze familial and environmental influences on these CSF markers and their relation to psychiatric symptoms and cognitive ability. CSF was collected from 17 complete twin pairs, nine monozygotic and eight dizygotic, and from one twin sibling. Two pairs were concordant for schizophrenia, and 11 pairs discordant for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder, and four pairs were not affected by psychotic disorders. Markers of microglia activation [monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), chitinase 3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), and soluble cluster of differentiation 14 (sCD14)], markers of \u03b2-amyloid metabolism (A\u03b2X-38, A\u03b2X-40, A\u03b2X-42 and A\u03b21-42), soluble amyloid precursor proteins (sAPP-\u03b1 and sAPP-\u03b2), total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (P-tau), and CSF/serum albumin ratio were measured in CSF using immunoassays. Heritability of the CSF markers was estimated, and associations to psychiatric and cognitive measurements were analyzed. Heritability estimates of the microglia markers were moderate, whereas several neurodegenerative markers showed high heritability. In contrast, A\u03b2X-42, A\u03b21-42, P-tau and CSF/serum albumin ratio were influenced by dominant genetic variation. Higher sCD14 levels were found in twins with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder compared to their not affected co-twins, and higher sCD14-levels were associated with psychotic symptoms. The study provides support for a significant role of sCD14 in psychotic disorders and a possible role of microglia activation in psychosis.",

    "abstract": "In this paper is presented the first original document of the delivery of conjoined twins on the territory of the present-day Vojvodina. The document number 1224 consists of two handwritten quires. On the first page of the first quire are a description and a drawing of the delivered twins. The delivery was described and drawn by Dr. Ernest Furjakovi\u0107, a shire physician in Ruma and the secondary physicus of the Srem County, who attended and handled the delivery. The conjoined twins were delivered in the night between 2 and 3 April 1852 in Mali Radinci, a small village in the Srem County nearby Ruma, in the far south of the Habsburg Monarchy. The twins, preserved in alcohol, were sent to Budapest to the professor of anatomy \"for the purposes of medical science\", as he wrote in the report. The second quire of the same document refers to the proof that the Commissariat in Ruma forwarded the doctor's report to the High Land Government in Timisoara. In the introduction, the authors displayed the known facts on the occurrence of conjoined twins in the world, which were used to compare with the described case. The data refer to the incidence of conjoined twins in the population, theory of its embryonic origin, their classification, treatment in cases of diagnosed pregnancy and the manner of their delivery. They also refer to the procedures of modern diagnostics, the possibilities of their surgical disjoin and related ethical questions. After that comes a part of the work dedicated to the analysis of the shown document, and the comparison of the several cases of the most significant conjoined twins in the world with these from Srem, as the authors named them. The authors showed short biography of the physician who delivered them, as well. At the end, they conclude that this work gives the first description of document of the delivery of the first known conjoined twins on the territory of the present-day Vojvodina.\nU radu je dan prikaz prvog originalnog dokumenta o ro\u0111enju spojenih blizanaca na teritoriju dana\u0161nje Vojvodine. Dokument pod brojem 1224 sastoji se od dva rukopisna arka. Na prvoj strani prvog arka nalazi se opis i crte\u017e poro\u0111enih blizanaca. Nacrtao ih je i opisao dr Ernest Furjakovi\u0107, pokrajinski lije\u010dnik u Rumi i sekundarni fizikus Sremske \u017eupanije, koji je prisustvovao i rukovodio poro\u0111ajem. Poro\u0111aj se dogodio u no\u0107i izme\u0111u 2. i 3. travnja 1852. godine u Malim Radincima, malom selu u Sremskoj \u017eupaniji, nedaleko od Rume, na krajnjem jugu Habsbur\u0161ke monarhije. Blizance je, konzervirane u alkoholu, poslao profesoru anatomije u Pe\u0161ti, \u201eza potrebe medicinske znanosti\u201c, kako je u izvje\u0161taju naveo. Drugi arak istog dokumenta odnosi se na potvrdu da je tada\u0161nji Komesarijat u Rumi proslijedio doktorov izvje\u0161taj Visokoj Zemaljskoj Vladi u Temi\u0161varu. U uvodnom dijelu rada autori su iznijeli do sada poznate podatke o pojavi spojenih blizanaca u svijetu, koji su kori\u0161teni radi uspore\u0111ivanja s prikazanim slu\u010dajem. Podaci se odnose na u\u010destalost pojave spojenih blizanaca u populaciji, postoje\u0107e teorije o njihovom nastanku u toku embriogeneze, njihovu klasifikaciju, postupak u slu\u010dajevima dijagnosticirane trudno\u0107e sa spojenim blizancima i na\u010dinu njihovog poro\u0111aja. Tako\u0111er se odnose na postupke suvremene dijagnostike, na mogu\u0107nosti njihovog kirur\u0161kog razdvajanja i eti\u010dka pitanja koja ono sa sobom nosi. Slijedi segment rada koji je posve\u0107en analizi prikazanog dokumenta, kao i uspore\u0111enju nekolicine slu\u010dajeva najzna\u010dajnijih spojenih blizanaca u svijetu sa slu\u010dajem spojenih blizanaca iz Srema, kako su ih autori rada nazvali. Autori su prikazali i kratku biografiju lije\u010dnika koji je blizance porodio. Na koncu zaklju\u010duju da je ovim radom dat prvi prikaz dokumenta o ro\u0111enju prvih do danas poznatih spojenih blizanaca na teritoriju dana\u0161nje Vojvodine.",

    "abstract": "Coming from a single zygote, monozygotic (MZ) twins share nearly all of their genetic materials and are almost strikingly similar in appearance. Yet they are often discordant for important phenotypes including complex diseases. The study of discordant MZ twins allows us to understand the role of epigenetics in complex traits by controlling many potential confounders, such as genetic factors, maternal effects, age and sex. As we know, DNA methylation is the most stable epigenetic modification. In human, many causal genes, regulating disease status by DNA methylation modification in imprinting disorders, psychological disorders, autoimmune diseases and cancers, have been discovered, which provides a foundation for studying epigenetic regulation of diseases and application of epigenetic drugs. This article reviews the latest findings on DNA methylation status, estimates of DNA methylation heritability as well as studies of DNA methylation regulation in complex traits using MZ twins, in order to provide reference for research on epigenetic modification in complex traits.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have shown that the in utero environment, which can be indexed by birth weight (BW), is associated with cortical morphology in adolescence and adulthood. Work in monozygotic (MZ) twins suggests that this association is driven by non-shared environmental factors. This correlation could be the result of in utero impacts on DNA methylation. The aim of the present study with MZ twins is to replicate the association between discordance in BW and brain morphology and test whether discordance in DNA methylation mediates this relationship.\nOne hundred and four adolescent MZ twins (52 pairs, of which 42% were male pairs) who have been followed regularly since birth underwent T1 weighted structural MRI, and epigenome-wide assessment of DNA methylation from saliva at age 15.\nCo-twins had very similar measures of DNA methylation and cortical morphology. Higher BW members of a twin pair had increased total cortical surface area, and decreased cortical thickness compared to their lower BW sibling. BW Discordance was positively associated with both cortical surface area and cortical volume discordance. Genes involved in neurodevelopment were tentatively identified as mediators of both the BW - cortical volume, and BW- cortical surface area relationships.\nThe association between BW and cortical morphology in adolescence appears to be attributable to in utero environmental effects, and DNA methylation may play a role in mediating this relationship.

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS)-associated transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) or acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) in monozygotic twins is exceedingly rare and has not been well characterized.\nWe describe a unique case of monozygotic twins with simultaneous TAM from a triplet pregnancy at 34 weeks' gestation. Previously reported cases of TAM and DS-AMKL in monozygotic twins have been reviewed to compare with our cases. The current concept of a sequential multistep process in leukemogenesis and disease evolution of TAM into DS-AMKL through the collaboration among trisomy 21, GATA1, and other gene mutations is also reviewed.\nDistinct GATA1 mutations are identified in our neonate twins with TAM from a triplet pregnancy, whereas precisely identical GATA1 mutations have been detected in all three monozygotic DS twins reported in the literature.\nIdentical GATA1 mutations in cases of monozygotic twins are likely derived from twin-twin transmission. Distinct GATA1 mutations identified in our neonate twins with TAM provide unequivocal evidence of independent intra-utero GATA1 mutations, a completely different mechanism of development of TAM in monozygotic twins from previously reported cases. Interaction of trisomy 21 and GATA1 mutation produces TAM, but additional gene mutations are required for TAM to transform into DS-AMKL.",

We included 68,629 live-born Danish twins from 1973 to 2009 identified through the Danish Twin Registry and performed piecewise stratified Cox regression and log-binomial regression.\nAmong 1933 deaths, we found significantly higher mortality for twin boys than for twin girls. For both sexes, OS twins had lower mortality than SS twins; the difference persisted for the first year of life for boys and for the first week of life for girls.\nAlthough the mortality risk for OS boys was in the expected direction according to the TTT hypothesis, the results for OS girls pointed in the opposite direction, providing no clear evidence for the TTT hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Target genes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been identified. In monozygotic twins discordant for AD we analysed the expression of selected genes, and their possible regulation by epigenetic mechanisms in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, possibly useful to discover biomarkers. Amyloid precursor protein, sirtuin 1 and peptidyl prolyl isomerase 1 gene expressions were highly up-regulated in the AD twin versus the healthy one. Consistently with sirtuin 1 role in controlling acetylation status, we observed a substantial reduction of the acetylation on histone 3 lysine 9, associated with gene transcription in the AD twin. Noteworthy in the AD twin we also observed an increased gene expression in two histone deacetylases (HDACs) isoforms: HDAC2 and HDAC9. A general DNA hypomethylation of all gene promoters studied was also observed in both twins. Our results unravel transcriptional and epigenetic differences potentially helpful to better understand environmental factors and phenotypic differences in monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies with moderate sample sizes are underpowered, especially when testing SNP alleles with low allele counts, a situation that may lead to high frequency of false-positive results and lack of replication in independent studies. Related individuals, such as twin pairs concordant for a disease, should confer increased power in genetic association analysis because of their genetic relatedness. We conducted a computer simulation study to explore the power advantage of the disease-concordant twin design, which uses singletons from disease-concordant twin pairs as cases and ordinary healthy samples as controls. We examined the power gain of the twin-based design for various scenarios (i.e., cases from monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for a disease) and compared the power with the ordinary case-control design with cases collected from the unrelated patient population. Simulation was done by assigning various allele frequencies and allelic relative risks for different mode of genetic inheritance. In general, for achieving a power estimate of 80%, the sample sizes needed for dizygotic and monozygotic twin cases were one half and one fourth of the sample size of an ordinary case-control design, with variations depending on genetic mode. Importantly, the enriched power for dizygotic twins also applies to disease-concordant sibling pairs, which largely extends the application of the concordant twin design. Overall, our simulation revealed a high value of disease-concordant twins in genetic association studies and encourages the use of genetically related individuals for highly efficiently identifying both common and rare genetic variants underlying human complex diseases without increasing laboratory cost.",

    "abstract": "The single stillbirth long-term intrauterine retention in dichorionic twin pregnancy is rarely reported. Also, the birth of a fetus is followed in most cases by immediate expulsion of the second twin. We hereby present an unusual case of asynchronous delivery of dichorionic twins, associating discordance for major and minor anomaly. The intrauterine death of the twin A, presenting a large sacrococcygeal tumor, occurred in the second trimester. The deceased twin A was born at 29 weeks' gestational age (GA). The twin B was extracted by Caesarean section at 31 weeks and had a good outcome. We performed a close follow-up of the high-risk pregnancy and we used tocolytic and antibiotic drugs for prolonging it. Corticoid therapy was administered for the lung maturation of the second twin. The expectant management in the single twin stillbirth dichorionic pregnancy and the asynchronous delivery had a significant impact on the newborn outcome.",

    "abstract": "There is limited research investigating educational attainment as a risk factor for low back pain (LBP), with the influence of gender commonly being neglected. Furthermore, genetics and early shared environment explain a substantial proportion of LBP cases and need to be controlled for when investigating risk factors for LBP.\nTo investigate whether educational attainment affects the prevalence and risk of LBP differently in men and women while controlling for the influence of genetics and early shared environment.\nThis is a cross-sectional and prospective twin case-control study.\nAdult monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins from the Murcia Twin Registry, with available data on educational attainment, formed the base sample for this study. The prevalence analysis considered twins with available data on LBP in 2013 (n=1,580). The longitudinal analysis considered twins free of LBP at baseline (2009-2011), with available data on LBP at follow-up (2013) (n=1,077).\nData on the lifetime prevalence of activity limiting LBP (outcome) and educational attainment (risk factor) were self-reported.\nThe prevalence analysis investigated the cross-sectional association between educational attainment and LBP, whereas the longitudinal analysis investigated whether educational attainment increased the risk of developing LBP. Both analyses were performed in the following sequence. First, a total sample analysis was performed on all twins (considering them as individuals), adjusting for confounding variables selected by the data. Second, to control for the influence of genetics and early shared environment, a within-pair case-control analysis (stratified by zygosity) was performed on complete twin pairs discordant for LBP (ie, one twin had LBP, whereas the co-twin did not). All analyses were stratified for gender where possible, with an interaction term determining whether gender was a significant moderator of the association between educational attainment and LBP.\nWomen with either general secondary or university education were less likely to experience (prevalence analysis) or to develop LBP (longitudinal analysis). Educational attainment did not affect the risk of LBP in men. When controlling for the effects of genetics and early shared environment, the relationship between educational status and LBP in women was no longer statistically significant.\nEducational attainment affects LBP differently in men and women, with higher levels of education only decreasing the risk of developing LBP in women. After adjusting for genetics and early shared environment, the relationship between educational attainment and LBP in women disappears. This suggests that genetics and early shared environment are confounding the relationship between educational attainment and LBP in women.",

It is usually asymptomatic and the diagnosis is often made on the occasion of the completion of a systematic blood count or a family survey. Clinical expression during the neonatal period is impossible and its association with hereditary spherocytosis is common. We report two monozygotic twins who, on the 3rd day of life, presented intense jaundice, unconjugated bilirubin associated with anemia, without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests found nonimmune hemolytic anemia with microcytosis and hypochromia justifying iterative blood transfusions. The etiological investigation found heterozygous beta-thalassemia associated with hereditary spherocytosis. The family investigation and molecular analysis objectified the beta-thalassemic mutation IVS1nt110 (G\u2192A) in the heterozygous state in the twins, the father, the mother, and in one of the two brothers. With any nonimmune hemolytic anemia in newborns, the etiological investigation should be systematic for early diagnosis and to plan appropriate treatment.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to study the differences in haemoglobin (Hb) at birth in dichorionic (DC) versus monochorionic (MC) twins in relation to birth order and mode of delivery.\nAll consecutive DC twin pregnancies and uncomplicated MC twin pregnancies with two live-born twins delivered at our centre were included in this retrospective cohort study. Hb levels at birth and on day 2 were evaluated in association with birth order and mode of delivery. The occurrence of polycythaemia (venous haematocrit >65%) was also recorded.\nA total of 300 DC and 290 MC twin pairs were included. In DC and MC twins delivered vaginally, second-born twins had a higher Hb level at birth compared with their co-twin (mean Hb level 16.7 vs 15.9\u2005g/dL (p<0.01) in DC twins and 17.8 vs 16.1\u2005g/dL (p<0.01) in MC twins). In twins delivered through caesarean section, no intertwin differences in Hb levels were detected. Polycythaemia occurred significantly more often in second-born twins compared with first-born twins delivered vaginally: 10 (5%) vs 2 (1%) (p=0.02) in DC twins and 20 (12%) vs 2 (1%) (p<0.01) in MC twins.\nSecond-born DC and MC twins delivered vaginally have higher Hb levels at birth compared with first-born twins. Intertwin Hb differences in MC twins may partly be related to blood transfusion through the vascular anastomoses. Since DC twins do not have anastomoses, other factors may lead to Hb differences, including differences in timing of umbilical cord clamping.",

We present epigenetic findings for a unique case of doubly exchanged Colombian male monozygotic twins raised in extremely different environments.\nUsing genome-wide DNA methylation data from cheek swabs from which blood-specific differentially methylated probes had been removed, the individuals grouped by shared genetics rather than shared environment, except for one twin who presented as an outlier.

The aim of this study was to determine the factors associated with dental caries in a pair of monozygotic twin girls with DS, where one had caries experience and the other did not. Clinical examination, salivary Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) levels and their genotypic diversity, the biochemical composition of the dental biofilm, the frequency of sucrose consumption, and toothbrushing habits were assessed from the twin girls. Twin with caries experience showed higher levels of S. mutans in the saliva and lower concentrations of calcium, phosphate, and fluoride and higher concentrations of extracellular polysaccharides in the biofilm compared to her sister. Genotypic diversity of S. mutans was also higher in the twin with caries experience. Dental biofilm composition showed different patterns of cariogenicity between the two sisters, which may also by itself explain the difference in the dental caries between them.",

    "abstract": "One salient characteristic of twin studies and the related behavioral genetics paradigm is the requirement of a large sample size. Countries or regions that are large in size and highly populated are at an advantage when implementing twin studies. However, given the fascinating and promising results obtained from twin studies, many researchers based in smaller countries or regions may still want to conduct twin studies in order to address local and theoretical issues. In this article, we have outlined the development of twin studies in Hong Kong, one of the Special Administrative Regions of China. The historical development and design of the two major twin studies of language and reading development implemented within Hong Kong are discussed, providing insights to researchers who also aspire to conduct twin studies in small regions.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of intrauterine environment on the magnitude of intrapair differences in six somatic traits of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins (1,263 pairs; 424 MZ twins and 839 DZ twins). Differences in intrauterine environments of MZ twins enforced division of the research material into four groups: (1) MZ-MC-TTTS - MZ twins from monochorionic (MC) pregnancies with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), (2) MZ-MC (without TTTS)-MZ twins from MC pregnancies without TTTS, (3) MZ-DC-MZ twins from dichorionic (DC) pregnancies, and (4) DZ-DZ twins. The intrapair differences in all analyzed somatic traits, especially body weight and circumference of the chest, were the largest in the case of MZ twins from MC pregnancies with TTTS. DZ twins were the group presenting with the second largest intrapair differences in the analyzed traits. At the end of pregnancy, that is, in lunar months 9 and 10, the magnitude of intrapair differences in all traits of twins from this group was significantly greater than in MZ twins from both MC and DC pregnancies. Irrespective of the analyzed period, the least evident, statistically insignificant intrapair differences in the studied traits were documented in the case of MZ twins from MC pregnancies without TTTS and twins from DC pregnancies. These findings imply that the differentiating effect of intrauterine environment is associated with the occurrence of TTTS, rather than with chorionicity, as postulated previously.",

    "abstract": "I am a mother to four-year-old twin girls. Life since their birth has not been easy and postnatal depression has blighted our relationship. So, too, has it affected the relationship I have with friends, family, my husband, myself. My reasons for becoming a student midwife were numerous, but my experiences as a pregnant woman and a new mother were pivotal in that decision. Whilst screening tools are commended to detect postnatal depression, depression does not fit a scoring system neatly, and is experienced differently by everyone. In addition, women suffering may falsify results (I did) and may not consent to use of the tools. Women's subjective experience of pregnancy, birth and motherhood is crucial, and PND needs to be spoken about in the antenatal period in order to overcome the associated stigma and to encourage women's self-efficacy in reporting symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The epigenetic clock, also known as DNA methylation age (DNAmAge), represents age-related changes of DNA methylation at multiple sites of the genome and is suggested to be a biomarker for biological age. Elevated blood DNAmAge is associated with all-cause mortality, with the strongest effects reported in a recent intrapair twin study where epigenetically older twins had increased mortality risk in comparison to their co-twins. In the study presented here, we hypothesize that DNAmAge in blood is associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive abilities in middle-aged individuals. In 486 monozygotic twins, we investigated the association of DNAmAge, difference between DNAmAge and chronological age and age acceleration with cognition. Despite using a powerful paired twin design, we found no evidence for association of blood DNAmAge with cognitive abilities. This observation was confirmed in unpaired analyses, where DNAmAge initially correlated with cognitive abilities, until adjusting for chronological age. Overall, our study shows that for middle-aged individuals DNAmAge calculated in blood does not correlate with cognitive abilities.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare, genetically determined error of metabolism. The characteristic clinical symptoms are diarrhea, juvenile cataracts, tendon xanthomas and neuropsychiatric alterations. The aim of this study is to present a pair of identical adult twins with considerable differences in the severity of phenotype. With regards to neuropsychiatric symptoms, the predominant features were severe Parkinsonism and moderate cognitive dysfunctions in the more-affected individual, whereas these alterations in the less-affected patient were only very mild and mild, respectively. The characteristic increase in the concentrations of serum cholestanol and the lesion volumes in dentate nuclei in the brain assessed with magnetic resonance imaging were quite similar in both cases. The lifestyle conditions, including eating habits of the twin pair, were quite similar as well; therefore, currently unknown genetic modifiers or certain epigenetic factors may be responsible for the differences in severity of phenotype. This case series serves as the first description of an identical twin pair with CTX presenting heterogeneous clinical features.",

    "abstract": "Increased cytokines and kynurenic acid (KYNA) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been reported in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The aim of the present study was to investigate cytokines and kynurenines in the CSF of twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and to study these CSF markers in relation to psychotic symptoms and personality traits. CSF levels of tryptophan (TRP), KYNA, quinolinic acid (QUIN), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were analyzed in 23 twins with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and in their not affected co-twins. Ratings of psychotic symptoms and personality traits were made using the Scales for Assessment of Negative and Positive symptoms, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV - Axis II Disorders, and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire - Brief. A total score for psychotic symptoms and personality traits was constructed for analysis. CSF KYNA was associated with the score for psychotic symptom and personality traits. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 were associated, and the intra-pair differences scores of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 were highly correlated. Intraclass correlations indicated genetic influences on CSF KYNA, TRP, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1. The association between KYNA and psychotic symptoms further supports a role of KYNA in psychotic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) is a rare neurodegenerative disease with early onset. PLA2G6 gene mutations have been identified in the majority individuals with INAD. In future, molecular diagnosis of INAD will replace the invasive biopsies used previously. In the present report, monozygotic male twins with INAD were referred The Children's Hospital (Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China) at fifteen months old for delayed development. The older brother was found to have developmental stagnation when he was 6 months old. The patient could not stand securely without support, and had poor eye tracking and listening ability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patient's brain revealed cerebellar atrophy and electromyography identified signs of peripheral neuropathy. The younger brother displayed similar clinical features and findings. Two different phospholipase A2 group VI (PLA2G6; 22q13.1) gene mutations were detected in the twins by DNA sequencing. The results of the present study indicate that neurogenetic disease should be considered when child patients present with idiopathic developmental stagnation, particularly when similar cases have appeared in the same family. In addition, INAD should be considered as a possible diagnosis when the patient has developmental delay of the central and peripheral nerves. In the future, molecular genetic testing will be the primary method of INAD diagnosis, enabling better prevention of this genetic disease.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies are powerful models to elucidate epigenetic modifications resulting from gene-environment interactions. Yet, commonly a limited number of clinical twin samples are available, leading to an underpowered situation afflicted with false positives and hampered by low sensitivity. We investigated genome-wide DNA methylation data from two small sets of monozygotic twins representing different phases during the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to find novel genes for further research.\nWe implemented a robust statistical methodology aimed at investigating a small number of samples to identify differential methylation utilizing the comprehensive CHARM platform with whole blood cell DNA from two sets of twin pairs discordant either for ACPA (antibodies to citrullinated protein antigens)-positive RA versus ACPA-negative healthy or for ACPA-positive healthy (a pre-RA stage) versus ACPA-negative healthy. To deconvolute cell type-dependent differential methylation, we assayed the methylation patterns of sorted cells and used computational algorithms to resolve the relative contributions of different cell types and used them as covariates.\nTo identify methylation biomarkers, five healthy twin pairs discordant for ACPAs were profiled, revealing a single differentially methylated region (DMR). Seven twin pairs discordant for ACPA-positive RA revealed six significant DMRs. After deconvolution of cell type proportions, profiling of the healthy ACPA discordant twin-set revealed 17 genome-wide significant DMRs. When methylation profiles of ACPA-positive RA twin pairs were adjusted for cell type, the analysis disclosed one significant DMR, associated with the EXOSC1 gene. Additionally, the results from our methodology suggest a temporal connection of the protocadherine beta-14 gene to ACPA-positivity with clinical RA.\nOur biostatistical methodology, optimized for a low-sample twin design, revealed non-genetically linked genes associated with two distinct phases of RA. Functional evidence is still lacking but the results reinforce further study of epigenetic modifications influencing the progression of RA. Our study design and methodology may prove generally useful in twin studies.",

Partially attributed to the development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the amygdala, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the precise genetic and experiential contributions remain unknown. In previous work, childhood basal cortisol function predicted adolescent resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) and psychopathology. To parse experience-driven (non-genetic) contributions, we investigated these relations with a monozygotic (MZ) twin design. Specifically, we examined whether intrapair differences in childhood afternoon cortisol levels predicted cotwin differences in adolescent brain function and coping.

    "abstract": "Host genetics is one of several factors known to shape human gut microbiome composition, however, the physiological processes underlying the heritability are largely unknown. Inter-individual differences in host factors secreted into the gut lumen may lead to variation in microbiome composition. One such factor is the ABO antigen. This molecule is not only expressed on the surface of red blood cells, but is also secreted from mucosal surfaces in individuals containing an intact FUT2 gene (secretors). Previous studies report differences in microbiome composition across ABO and secretor genotypes. However, due to methodological limitations, the specific bacterial taxa involved remain unknown.\nHere, we sought to determine the relationship of the microbiota to ABO blood group and secretor status in a large panel of 1503 individuals from a cohort of twins from the United Kingdom. Contrary to previous reports, robust associations between either ABO or secretor phenotypes and gut microbiome composition were not detected. Overall community structure, diversity, and the relative abundances of individual taxa were not significantly associated with ABO or secretor status. Additionally, joint-modeling approaches were unsuccessful in identifying combinations of taxa that were predictive of ABO or secretor status.\nDespite previous reports, the taxonomic composition of the microbiota does not appear to be strongly associated with ABO or secretor status in 1503 individuals from the United Kingdom. These results highlight the importance of replicating microbiome-associated traits in large, well-powered cohorts to ensure results are robust.",

    "abstract": "A 6.5-year-old clinically healthy German Shepherd Dog with regular oestrous cycles of 6\u00a0months was presented for pregnancy diagnosis on day 38 after ovulation (p.ov.). Ultrasonography revealed three individual placental sites in progressed resorption and two vital adequately developed foetuses sharing a joint placenta. On days 41 and 48\u00a0p.ov., sonographic signs indicated normal development of both foetuses, but on day 52\u00a0p.ov., both foetuses were found to be dead. A caesarean section was performed the same day. Examination of the removed uterus confirmed the diagnosis of a \"twin\" pregnancy with two foetuses sharing the same placental site but separate amniotic membranes. One foetus showed generalized oedema (anasarca). Bacterial culture of swabs taken from inside the placental cavity was negative. At histological examination of the uterus, no signs of inflammation were found. Serum relaxin concentrations (day 38, 41, 48 and 52.\u00a0p.ov.) were consistent with those of bitches with normal pregnancies. Cytogenetic analysis of the two foetuses revealed dizygotic twins, one male and one female according to SRY-PCR. By genotyping 17 high-polymorphic canine microsatellites, it could be demonstrated that the two foetuses developed from two different oocytes.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic variability among individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) has long been a challenge for clinicians and an enigma for researchers. Members of the same family and even identical twins with NF1 often demonstrate variable disease expression. Many mechanisms for this variability have been proposed. We have performed an exploratory study of copy number variants (CNVs) as a possible source of phenotypic variability in NF1. We enrolled 11 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins with NF1 and their parents, catalogued their clinical characteristics, and utilized a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray to identify CNVs in blood and saliva. The 11 twin pairs showed high concordance for presence and number of caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, cutaneous neurofibromas, IQ, and ADHD. They were more likely to be discordant for optic pathway glioma, plexiform neurofibromas, skeletal manifestations, and malignancy. Microarray analysis identified a total of 81 CNVs meeting our conservative criteria, 37 of which overlap known genes. Of interest, three CNVs were previously unreported. Microarray analysis failed to ascertain any CNV differences within twin pairs, between twins and parents, or between tissues in any one individual. Results of this small pilot study did not demonstrate any de novo CNV events in our MZ twin pairs, nor were de novo CNVs overrepresented in these individuals with NF1. A much larger sample size would be needed to form any conclusions about the role of CNVs in NF1 variable expressivity. Alternative explanations for discordant phenotypes include epigenetic changes, smaller genetic alterations, or environmental factors. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are age-related conditions that are increasing in prevalence, commonly coexist, and share clinical features. This review provides a practical update on the\u00a0epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of patients with concomitant HFpEF and AF. Epidemiological studies highlight the close and complex links between HFpEF and AF, the shared risk factors, the high\u00a0AF\u00a0occurrence in the natural history of HFpEF, and the independent contribution of each condition to poor outcomes. Diagnosis of HFpEF in the setting of AF is challenging because the symptoms overlap. AF is associated with changes in\u00a0echocardiographic parameters and circulating natriuretic peptides that confound HFpEF diagnosis. Symptomatic improvement with diuretic therapy supports the presence of HFpEF in patients with concomitant AF. Important knowledge gaps need to be addressed by a multidisciplinary and translational research approach to develop novel therapies that can improve prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Health-related behaviors are significant contributors to morbidity and mortality in the United States, yet evidence on the underlying causes of the vast within-population variation in behaviors is mixed. While many potential causes of health-related behaviors have been identified-such as schooling, genetics, and environments-little is known on how much of the variation across multiple behaviors is due to a common set of causes. We use three separate datasets on U.S. twins to investigate the degree to which multiple health-related behaviors correlate and can be explained by a common set of factors. We find that aside from smoking and drinking, most behaviors are not strongly correlated among individuals. Based on the results of both within-identical-twins regressions and multivariate behavioral genetics models, we find some evidence that schooling may be related to smoking but not to the covariation between multiple behaviors. Similarly, we find that a large fraction of the variance in each of the behaviors is consistent with genetic factors; however, we do not find strong evidence that a single common set of genes explains variation in multiple behaviors. We find, however, that a large portion of the correlation between smoking and heavy drinking is consistent with common, mostly childhood, environments. This suggests that the initiation and patterns of these two behaviors might arise from a common childhood origin. Research and policy to identify and modify this source may provide a strong way to reduce the population health burden of smoking and heavy drinking.",

    "abstract": "Family study can provide estimates of overall genetic influences on a particular trait because family relationships provide accurate measures of average genetic sharing. However, evidence of genetic contributions to skin phenotypes is limited, which may preclude genetic studies to identify genetic variants or to understand underlying molecular biology of skin traits. This study aimed to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to selected dermatologic phenotypes, that is, to melanin index, sebum secretion, and skin humidity level in a Korean twin-family cohort. We investigated more than 2,000 individuals from 486 families, including 388 monozygotic twin pairs and 82 dizygotic twin pairs. Variance component method was used to estimate genetic influences in terms of heritability. Heritability of skin melanin index, sebum secretion, and skin humidity (arm and cheek) were estimated to be 0.44 [95% CI 0.38-0.49], 0.21 [95% CI 0.16-0.26], 0.13 [95% CI 0.07-0.18], and 0.11 [95% CI 0.06-0.16] respectively, after adjusting for confounding factors. Our findings suggest that genetics play a major role on skin melanin index, but only mild roles on sebum secretion and humidity. Sebum secretion and skin humidity are controlled predominantly by environmental factors notably on shared environments among family members. We expect that our findings add insight to determinants of common dermatologic traits, and serve as a reference for biologic studies.",

    "abstract": "Peters anomaly is a rare developmental malformation involving the anterior segment of the eye, which culminates in amblyopia or congenital blindness. Multiple ocular and/or systemic malformations have been observed with this anomaly, and novel comorbidities continue to be reported.\nThe probands were monozygotic twin boys (twin I and twin II) born to consanguineous parents at 36 weeks of gestation. Coarse facial features and deep-seated eyes were noted at birth. At 6 months, ophthalmic examination revealed that both twins were unable to blink in response to light, or to fixate and follow a moving object. Both twins had prominent horizontal nystagmus. Slit-lamp examination demonstrated varying degrees of central leukoma (corneal opacity) associated with iridocorneal adhesion, which is characteristic of type I Peters anomaly. No cataractous changes were observed. Normal intraocular pressure and disorganized retina were observed. Pupillary abnormalities included bilaterally underdeveloped pupils and bilateral absence of pupils was noted. Ocular MRI showed bilateral microphthalmia and optic nerve hypoplasia, with a small optic chiasm in both twins. At this age, the diagnosis of Peters anomaly was made. At 16 months of age, both twins developed deep venous thrombosis and purpuric skin lesions. Investigations revealed a hereditary thrombophilia secondary to a homozygous mutation causing protein C deficiency, which is a rare thrombotic condition. Ocular ultrasonography revealed bilateral vitreous hemorrhaging linked to altered coagulation. One twin developed bilateral inguinal hernia and cryptorchidism.\nThe novel concordance of Peters anomaly in these monozygotic twins sharing a mutation in PROC gene provides further evidence that this anomaly has a genetic basis. Hypoplasia of the optic nerves and optic chiasm, along with severe protein C deficiency and bilateral absence of the pupils, are associated comorbidities that have not previously been reported with this anomaly.",

On D3, both leptin and HDL-C levels were significantly lower and TG levels were significantly higher in IUGR twins. In the discordant group, the alterations in lipids were not related to any adipokine.\nIUGR is related to lower leptin level and proatherogenic lipid profile (higher TG and lower HDL-C), which are not influenced by adipokine at birth.",

    "abstract": "This investigation examines the spread of problem behaviors (substance use and delinquency) between twin siblings. A sample of 628 twins (151 male twin pairs and 163 female twin pairs) drawn from the Quebec Newborn Twin Study completed inventories describing delinquency and substance use at ages 13, 14, and 15. A 3-wave longitudinal actor-partner interdependence model (APIM) identified avenues whereby problem behaviors spread from one twin to another. Problems did not spread directly between twins across domains. Instead, 2 indirect pathways were identified: (a) Problems first spread interindividually (between twins) within a behavioral domain, then spread intraindividually (within twins) across behavioral domains (e.g., Twin A delinquency \u2192 Twin B delinquency \u2192 Twin B substance use); and (b) problems first spread intraindividually (within twins) across behavioral domains, then spread interindividually (between twins) within a behavioral domain (e.g., Twin A delinquency \u2192 Twin A substance use \u2192 Twin B substance use). Controls for genetic effects, gene-environment correlations, friend substance use and delinquency, and parenting behaviors increase confidence in the conclusion that twin siblings uniquely contribute to the spread of problem behaviors during adolescence. Twin sibling influence is a risk factor for illicit substance use, both because substance use by one twin predicts substance use by the other twin, but also because delinquency in one twin predicts delinquency in the other twin, which then gives rise to greater substance use.

    "abstract": "Depression is a significant problem and it is vital to understand its underlying causes and related policy implications. Neighborhood characteristics are implicated in depression but the nature of this association is unclear. Unobserved or unmeasured factors may confound the relationship. This study addresses confounding in a twin study investigating neighborhood-level effects on depression controlling for genetics, common environment, and gene\u00d7environment (G \u00d7 E) interactions.\nData on neighborhood deprivation and depression were gathered from 3155 monozygotic twin pairs and 1275 dizygotic pairs (65.7% female) between 2006 and 2013. The variance for both depression and neighborhood deprivation was decomposed into three components: additive genetic variance (A); shared environmental variance (C); and non-shared environmental variance (E). Depression was then regressed on neighborhood deprivation to test the direct association and whether that association was confounded. We also tested for a G \u00d7 E interaction in which the heritability of depression was modified by the level of neighborhood deprivation.\nDepression and neighborhood deprivation showed evidence of significant A (21.8% and 15.9%, respectively) and C (13.9% and 32.7%, respectively) variance. Depression increased with increasing neighborhood deprivation across all twins (p = 0.009), but this regression was not significant after controlling for A and C variance common to both phenotypes (p = 0.615). The G \u00d7 E model showed genetic influences on depression increasing with increasing neighborhood deprivation (p < 0.001).\nNeighborhood deprivation is an important contributor to depression via increasing the genetic risk. Modifiable pathways that link neighborhoods to depression have been proposed and should serve as targets for intervention and research.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined the adequacy of a three-item parent questionnaire in determining the zygosity of young Chinese twins and whether there was any association between parent response accuracy and some demographic variables. The sample consisted of 334 pairs of same-sex Chinese twins aged from 3 to 11\u00a0years. Three scoring methods, namely the summed score, logistic regression, and decision tree, were employed to evaluate parent response accuracy of twin zygosity based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) information. The results showed that all three methods achieved high level of accuracy ranging from 91 to 93\u00a0% which was comparable to the accuracy rates in previous Chinese twin studies. Correlation results also showed that the higher the parents' education level or the family income was, the more likely parents were able to tell correctly that their twins are identical or fraternal. The present findings confirmed the validity of using a three-item parent questionnaire to determine twin zygosity in a Chinese school-aged twin sample.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota has been typically viewed as an environmental factor for human health. Twins are well suited for investigating the concordance of their gut microbiomes and decomposing genetic and environmental influences. However, existing twin studies utilizing metagenomic shotgun sequencing have included only a few samples. Here, we sequenced fecal samples from 250 adult twins in the TwinsUK registry and constructed a comprehensive gut microbial reference gene catalog. We demonstrate heritability of many microbial taxa and functional modules in the gut microbiome, including those associated with diseases. Moreover, we identified 8 million SNPs in the gut microbiome and observe a high similarity in microbiome SNPs between twins that slowly decreases after decades of living apart. The results shed new light on the genetic and environmental influences on the composition and function of the gut microbiome that could relate to risk of complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "The associations of body mass index (BMI) and liver fat (LF) with circulating prandial metabolomic markers are incompletely understood.\nWe aimed to characterize circulating metabolite excursions during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and evaluate whether the metabolomic signatures of BMI discordance coassociate with LF content.\nWe measured 80 metabolite parameters by nuclear magnetic resonance, together with glucose and insulin, during a 2-hour OGTT in 64 monozygotic (MZ) and 73 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs (aged 22.8 to 36.2 years). Metabolite excursions during the OGTT were compared within BMI-discordant (intrapair difference, BMI \u2265 3 kg/m2) cotwins separately within MZ and DZ pairs. Insulin-based indices were calculated from the OGTT. LF was measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 25 BMI-discordant MZ pairs. Metabolite profiles were compared with respect to LF discordance (\u0394LF% \u2265 2%).\nWe replicated many previously reported OGTT-induced metabolite excursions in all 274 individuals and report novel lipoprotein excursions. The associations between some metabolite excursions and BMI differed in MZ and DZ twins. In BMI-discordant MZ pairs (mean \u0394BMI = 4.9 kg/m2) who were concordant for LF (\u03940.2%), few metabolites differed between the cotwins: very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were elevated, and high-density lipoprotein size and concentration were decreased in the cotwins with higher BMI. In contrast, in BMI-discordant MZ pairs (\u0394BMI = 6.1 kg/m2) who were discordant for LF (\u03946.8%), cotwins with higher BMI exhibited lower insulin sensitivity and widespread metabolomic differences: elevations in small VLDL and low-density lipoprotein particles, fatty acids (FAs), and isoleucine. Within all 64 MZ twin pairs, lower insulin sensitivity associated with higher levels of VLDLs, triglycerides, FAs, and isoleucine.\nBMI-discordant MZ twin pairs who also are discordant for LF have more pronounced within-pair differences in metabolomics profiles during an OGTT than BMI-discordant pairs without LF discordance.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the relationship between respiratory morbidity in twins by gestational age, birth order and mode of delivery.\nAll twin deliveries at <37 weeks, registered in a national database, in the period 2003-2012 were classified into four gestational age groups: 33-36, 30-32, 28-29, and <28 weeks. Outcome variables included transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and need for assisted ventilation.\nA total of 1836 twins were born vaginally, and 2142 twins were born by cesarean delivery, for a grand total of 3978 twins.

In contrast, RDS was more frequent among the second born twins in the vaginal birth groups born at 30-36 weeks [odds ratio (OR) 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-5.1 and OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.5 for 33-36 weeks and 30-32 weeks, respectively], whereas this trend was seen in the cesarean birth groups born earlier (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.1-13.0 for 28-29 weeks). Cesarean delivery significantly increased the frequency of RDS in twin A as well as in twin B compared with vaginal birth, but only at gestational ages <30 weeks.\nMode of delivery and birth order have a gestational age dependent effect on the incidence of RDS.",

Indications for delivery, infants' morbidities and medical interventions were documented. Twins and singletons were compared for antenatal maternal characteristics, risks of short-term neonatal complications and interventions.\nOne hundred and seventy-three mothers and 229 neonates (114 twins and 115 singletons) were included. Background maternal characteristics as well as the use of antenatal steroids and MgSO4 were similar between the groups. Only 44% of all deliveries were spontaneous, while the rest were indicated deliveries. Twins were born lighter and 31.9% of them were SGA. Nevertheless, singletons were significantly more likely to receive medical interventions such as prolonged oxygen use (>1 day) and phototherapy. All late preterm infants (n=5) needing surfactant administration were singletons. Overall, the risk of needing any medical intervention was significantly higher for singletons compared with twins (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.02-3.2).\nA significant proportion of late preterm births is iatrogenic.

    "abstract": "This prospective cohort study evaluated the relationship between fertility treatments and the prevalence and outcomes of dichorionic discordant twins. This issue has gained importance due to twin gestations resulting from fertility treatments.\nMothers of dichorionic twin pregnancies achieved in a single fertility clinic by assisted reproduction techniques, who had completed the first trimester of the pregnancy, were prospectively enrolled. Pregnancies with major fetal anomalies were excluded. Data regarding concordant and discordant twins based on the fertility treatments given to achieve the pregnancies were analyzed to determine the prevalence of discordance and pregnancy outcomes.\nA total of 571 dichorionic twin pregnancies were available for evaluation. Fertility treatments modalities, sperm quality and implantation of cultured and thawed embryos did not influence the rate and severity of discordant twins. Increased hospitalization rates were found among discordant (n=108) compared to concordant (n=463) twins (47.2% vs. 31.3%, P<0.0001) and higher rates of betamethasone treatment (65.7% vs. 28.9%, P<0.0001).

    "abstract": "We compared the nature of the sibling relationship in dyads of varying genetic relatedness, employing a behavioural genetic design to estimate the contribution that genes and the environment have on this familial bond. Two samples were used-the Sisters and Brothers Study consisted of 173 families with two target non-twin children (mean ages\u00a0=\u00a07.42 and 5.22\u00a0years respectively); and the Twins, Family and Behaviour study included 234 families with two target twin children (mean age\u00a0=\u00a04.70\u00a0years). Mothers and fathers reported on their children's relationship with each other, via a postal questionnaire (the Sisters and Brothers Study) or a telephone interview (the Twins, Family and Behaviour study). Contrary to expectations, no mean level differences emerged when monozygotic twin pairs, dizygotic twin pairs, and non-twin pairs were compared on their sibling relationship quality. Behavioural genetic analyses also revealed that the sibling bond was modestly to moderately influenced by the genetic propensities of the children within the dyad, and moderately to substantially influenced by the shared environment common to both siblings. In addition, for sibling negativity, we found evidence of twin-specific environmental influence-dizygotic twins showed more reciprocity than did non-twins. Our findings have repercussions for the broader application of results from future twin-based investigations.",

    "abstract": "The language development of twins tends to lag behind in comparison to that of singletons. The purpose of this study was to compare expressive and receptive language skills of 3- to 12-year-old twins with singletons. Secondly, correlations between language differences between twins and singletons and age were investigated.\nTwenty-four twins with a mean age of 5.1 years participated in the study. The control group consisted of 24 singletons who were matched for gender and age. Language development was investigated using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals.\nTwins scored significantly lower for expressive and receptive language skills compared to singletons. Even when excluding preterm-born children, twins still scored significantly lower for expressive language skills. There was no correlation between age and language differences between twins and their matched singletons.\nTwins score lower for expressive and receptive language skills compared to singletons, and preterm birth cannot be regarded as the main cause for the language delay. The language delay in twins is rather mild but does not seem to decrease with increasing age.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare medical phenomenon that offers a unique challenge for medical professionals. The complex anatomy of conjoined twins dictates their survival and amenability to separation, making each case different in terms of medical management, surgical planning, and patient outcomes. Thoraco-omphalo-ischiopagus twins, joined from the thorax to the pelvis, are one of the rarest orientations recorded in the medical literature, and successful separation of this subset of conjoined twins has not been documented. This report presents a novel case of thoraco-omphalo-ischiopagus tetrapus twins who were successfully separated at 10 months of age. The preoperative planning, operative details, and postoperative course are discussed as they relate to the reconstructive effort.\nThree-dimensional medical modeling was pursued early in the planning process and was used to estimate the soft-tissue requirements for reconstruction and to design custom tissue expanders.\nThe reconstructive effort required postponement until respiratory status was optimized. Even with elaborate preoperative planning, primary closure of the abdomen was limited because of tissue edema and other less predictable patient factors. Delayed closure of the abdominal wall was made possible with negative-pressure wound therapy and secondary flap advancements.\nPreoperative coordination with necessary vendors, a multidisciplinary surgical effort, and optimal timing of the surgical intervention all contribute to the successful separation and long-term survival of thoraco-omphalo-ischiopagus conjoined twins.\nTherapeutic, V.",

    "abstract": "The type of cord insertion within monochorionic twin pairs could be different. The purpose of study is to evaluate the association of different combinations of placental umbilical cord insertions with birth weight discordance in a large cohort of monochorionic twins.\nAll consecutive monochorionic placentas from either uncomplicated twin pregnancies or with fetal weight discordance examined and injected with color dye at our centers were included in this study (n\u00a0=\u00a0374). Marginal or velamentous cord insertions were defined as abnormal. Placentas were categorized as concordant when the cord insertions of both fetuses were either normal-normal or abnormal-abnormal, and as discordant when they were normal-abnormal. Birth weight discordance was defined as a difference in birth weight of each twin \u226525%. The association of different cord insertion combinations with birth weight discordance was analyzed.\nThe rate of discordant cord insertions was 55% (204/374) in monochorionic twins. A highly significant association between discordant cord insertions and discordant birth weight was observed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The odds ratios (OR) for birth weight discordance in the discordant cord insertion group compared with the concordant group were 2.3 (95% CI: 1.2-4.4) for the normal-marginal and 5.9 (95% CI: 3.8-10.4) for the normal-velamentous cord insertion subgroup. Discordant cord insertions are associated with the occurrence of unequal placental sharing (OR 4.3, 95%CI 2.7-6.9).\nDiscordance of cord insertions is associated with discordance of birth weight and may therefore be an important indicator of adverse outcome in monochorionic twins.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies are at increased risk for perinatal morbidity and death because of many factors that include a high incidence of preterm delivery. Compared with singleton pregnancies, overall perinatal risk of death is higher in twin pregnancies; however, for the preterm period, the perinatal mortality rate has been reported to be lower in twins.\nThe purpose of this study was to compare perinatal mortality rates in relation to gestational age at birth between singleton and twin pregnancies, taking into account socioeconomic status, fetal sex, and parity.\nWe studied perinatal mortality rates according to gestational age at birth in 1,502,120 singletons pregnancies and 51,658 twin pregnancies without congenital malformations who were delivered between 2002 and 2010 after 28 weeks of gestation. Data were collected from the nationwide Netherlands Perinatal Registry.\nOverall the perinatal mortality rate in twin pregnancies (6.6/1000 infants) was higher than in singleton pregnancies (4.1/1000 infants). However, in the preterm period, the perinatal mortality rate in twin pregnancies was substantially lower than in singleton pregnancies (10.4 per 1000 infants as compared with 34.5 per 1000 infants, respectively) for infants who were born at <37 weeks of gestation; this held especially for antepartum deaths. After 39 weeks of gestation, the perinatal mortality rate was higher in twin pregnancies. Differences in parity, fetal sex, and socioeconomic status did not explain the observed differences in outcome.\nOverall the perinatal mortality rate was higher in twin pregnancies than in singleton pregnancies, which is most likely caused by the high preterm birth rate in twins and not by a higher mortality rate for gestation, apart from term pregnancies. During the preterm period, the antepartum mortality rate was much lower in twin pregnancies than in singleton pregnancies. We suggest that this might be partially due to a closer monitoring of twin pregnancies, which indirectly suggests a need for closer surveillance of singleton pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Identical twin brothers developed mild encephalopathy at the age of 7.0 and 9.7 years (Patient 1) and 10.7 years (Patient 2). Patient 1 had influenza A at the time of his second episode, but triggering agents were not evident at the first episode. The triggering agents in Patient 2 were unclear. The neurological features of both patients included transient facial numbness, left arm paresis, dysarthria, and gait disturbance. Diffusion-weighted images from magnetic resonance imaging showed high signal levels at the splenium of corpus callosum and in the bilateral cerebral deep white matter. These results are characteristic of mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible isolated splenium of corpus callosum lesion. All three episodes were treated with a methylprednisolone pulse. Acyclovir was also administered to Patient 2 and to Patient 1 during his first episode. Patient 1 received an anti-influenza agent and intravenous immunoglobulin during his second episode. Both patients recovered completely without sequelae. Genetic factors, which may predispose identical twins to develop encephalopathy, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "To investigate maternal serum inhibin as a marker of pre-eclampsia (PE) in twins.\nOne hundred forty-three twins and 109 unaffected singleton pregnancies were recruited in the first trimester from the same institution. Blood samples were stored at recruitment and in the second trimester, retrospectively tested for inhibin and values expressed in multiples of the gestation-specific median (MoMs) in singletons, adjusted for maternal weight, as appropriate.\nThe median inhibin level in unaffected twins was 2.04 MoM compared with 1.00 MoM in singletons (P\u2009<\u20090.0001, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, one-tailed). Excluding early fetal losses the median in 22 samples from 12 twins with PE was 2.65 MoM compared with 1.99 MoM in 201 samples from 120 unaffected twins (P\u2009<\u20090.02, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test). This effect was restricted to second trimester samples with medians in cases and controls of 2.86 and 1.91 MoM respectively. Logistic regression of inhibin A together with established PE marker placental growth factor and placental associated plasma protein showed that in the second trimester, it improved screening performance although not reaching statistical significance (P\u2009=\u20090.08).\nInhibin A is a potential second trimester marker of PE in twins. It may improve on existing twin screening protocols but more data are required. \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "A limited body of research is available on the relationships between multiplicity of birth and neuropsychological functioning in preterm children who were conceived in the age of assisted reproductive technology and served by the modern neonatal intensive care unit. Our chief objective was to evaluate whether, after adjustment for sociodemographic factors and perinatal complications, twin birth accounted for a unique portion of developmental outcome variance in children born at-risk in the surfactant era.\nWe compared the neuropsychological functioning of 77 twins and 144 singletons born preterm (<34 gestational weeks) and served by William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI. Children were evaluated at preschool age, using standardized tests of memory, language, perceptual, and motor abilities.\nMultiple regression analyses, adjusting for sociodemographic and perinatal variables, revealed no differences on memory or motor indices between preterm twins and their singleton counterparts. In contrast, performance of language and visual processing tasks was significantly lower in twins despite reduced perinatal risk in comparison to singletons. Effect sizes ranged from .33 to .38 standard deviations for global language and visual processing ability indices, respectively. No significant group by sex interactions were observed, and comparison of first-, or second-born twins with singletons yielded medium effect sizes (Cohen's d=.56 and .40, respectively).\nThe modest twin disadvantage on language and visual processing tasks at preschool-age could not be readily attributable to socioeconomic or perinatal variables. The possibility of biological or social twinning-related phenomena as mechanisms underlying the observed performance gaps are discussed. (JINS, 2016, 22, 865-877).",

    "abstract": "We describe Caucasian monozygotic twin brothers with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and discuss influence of predictors to methotrexate (MTX) outcome treatment. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the MTX metabolic pathways were genotyped. Twins have multiple mutations: a CC mutation of SNP 1298A>C in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, CC mutations of three SNPs in the adenosine receptor gene ADORA2A (rs3761422_4217241T>C, rs2267076_4221164T>C, rs2236624_4226593T>C), and a heterozygous genotype in SNPs ATIC_rs2372536_347C>G, MTHFD1_rs2236225_1958G>A. These mutations are known to predict a worse outcome of MTX treatment. The twins had different lifestyles (alcohol drinking and smoking in Twin 1, regular coffee consumption in Twin 2), but a very similar clinical presentation of the outset of RA, radiographic scoring according to the Sharp/van der Heijde method with an almost identical antibodies presentation. The period of the patients before anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment was characterized by unsuccessful per oral MTX pharmacotherapy in both cases (a low effect of MTX in Twin 1; an early discontinuation of MTX due to an adverse event in Twin 2). In both twins, the outcome of well-controlled anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment (co-medication with MTX in Twin 1) for 10 years was expressed as low disease activity measured using composite index DAS28. It is interesting that Twin 2 had an unfavorable radiographic scoring after a 10-year follow-up than Twin 1 in spite of the comparable DAS28 in Twin 2 and smoking in Twin 1. In conclusion, co-medication of MTX with biologics may impact on RA radiographic progression despite predicted bad MTX outcome based on pharmacogenetic analysis.",

    "abstract": "Using Swedish nationwide registry data, the authors investigated the correlation of genetic and environmental risk factors in the etiology of drug abuse as ascertained from medical and criminal registries by modeling twin and sibling data. Medical drug abuse was defined using public inpatient and outpatient records, while criminal drug abuse was ascertained through legal records. Twin, full and half sibling pairs were obtained from the national twin and genealogical registers. Information about sibling pair residence within the same household was obtained from Statistics Sweden. Standard bivariate genetic structural equation modeling was applied to the population-based data on drug abuse ascertained through medical and crime registries, using OpenMx. Analyses of all possible pairs of twins (MZ: N\u00a0=\u00a04482; DZ: N\u00a0=\u00a09838 pairs), full-\u00a0(N\u00a0=\u00a01,278,086) and half-siblings (paternal: N\u00a0=\u00a07767; maternal N\u00a0=\u00a070,553) who grew up together suggested that factors explaining familial resemblance for drug abuse as defined through medical or criminal registries were mostly the same. Results showed substantial heritability and moderate contributions of shared environmental factors to drug abuse; both were higher in males versus females, and higher for drug abuse ascertained through criminal than medical records. Because of the low prevalence of both assessments of drug abuse, having access to population data was crucial to obtain stable estimates. Using objective registry data, the authors found that drug abuse-whether ascertained through medical versus criminal records-was highly heritable. Furthermore, shared environmental factors contributed significantly to the liability of drug abuse. Genetic and shared environmental risk factors for these two forms of drug abuse were highly correlated.",

Data were from Gemini, a British birth cohort of 2402 twins born in 2007. Zygosity was assessed twice, using both DNA and a validated parent report questionnaire at 8 (SD\u00a0=\u00a02.1) and 29\u00a0months (SD\u00a0=\u00a03.3). 220/731 (8\u00a0months) and 119/453 (29\u00a0months) monozygotic (MZ) pairs were misclassified as dizygotic (DZ) by parents; whereas only 6/797 (8\u00a0months) and 2/445 (29\u00a0months) DZ pairs were misclassified as MZ. Intraclass correlations for parent reported eating behaviors (four measured at 8\u00a0months; five at 16\u00a0months) were of the same magnitude for correctly classified and misclassified MZ pairs, suggesting that parental zygosity perception does not influence reporting on eating behaviors of their young twins.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies are associated with adverse perinatal outcome. Intertwin discordances at the time of nuchal translucency (NT) screening may have a value in the prediction of fetal loss or twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. We aimed to determine the ability of intertwin NT and crown rump length (CRL) discordances among MCDA twins to predict adverse outcomes.\nAll MCDA twins with a documented routine ultrasound at 11 to 13+6 weeks' gestation, and known pregnancy outcome between August 2003 and August 2012 were included. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the ideal NT and CRL discordances cut-off points that maximized the ability to predict adverse outcome, which was defined as any of: death of one or both twins, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, or estimated fetal weight or birth weight discordances \u226525%.\nOf the 89 cases, 20 (22.5%) had at least one adverse outcome. NT discordance was more discriminatory of adverse outcome than was CRL discordance. The optimal values for predicting any adverse outcomes for NT were >23.7% and for CRL >3.5%. The positive predictive values for NT (52.4%) and CRL (29.8%) screening were relatively low; however, the lack of either NT or CRL discordances was more reassuring, with negative predictive values of 86.8% and 86.4%, respectively.\nNT discordance is more predictive for adverse fetal outcome in MCDA twins than CRL discordance. Neither NT nor CRL discordance are likely to modify the intensive monitoring required for these very high-risk pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Verbal and physical aggression begin early in life and steadily decline thereafter in normal development. As a result, elevated aggressive behavior in adolescence may signal atypical development and greater vulnerability for negative mental and health outcomes. Converging evidence suggests that brain disturbances in regions involved in impulse control, emotional regulation, and sensation seeking may contribute to heightened aggression. However, little is known regarding the neural mechanisms underlying subtypes of aggression (i.e., proactive and reactive aggression) and whether they differ between males and females. Using a sample of 106 14-year-old adolescent twins, this study found that striatal enlargement was associated with both proactive and reactive aggression. We also found that volumetric alterations in several frontal regions including smaller middle frontal and larger orbitofrontal cortex were correlated with higher levels of aggression in adolescent twins. In addition, cortical thickness analysis showed that thickness alterations in many overlapping regions including middle frontal, superior frontal, and anterior cingulate cortex and temporal regions were associated with aggression in adolescent twins. Results support the involvement of fronto-limbic-striatal circuit in the etiology of aggression during adolescence. Aggr. Behav. 43:230-240, 2017. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins were previously regarded as \"identical\". By now an increasing number of case reports of monozygotic but discordant twins have been reported, and therefore discordance between monozygotic twins is being investigated intensively. We report a case of female preterm monozygotic twins who were discordant for fetal megacystis due to cloacal dysgenesis. Pregnancy was achieved after intracytoplasmatic sperm injection and transfer of 2 embryos. By the first trimester fetal megacystis with consecutive oligohydramnios and hypoplasia of the lungs was diagnosed. Both foetuses had normal karyotypes. After delivery at 25+3 weeks of gestation due to premature labour, the affected child was treated palliatively and died within 2 hours. In the postmortem physical examination, a cloacal dysgenesis was detected. In the male foetus, megacystis is typically caused by obstructive uropathy. In the rarely affected female foetus, it usually results from complex urogenital malformations like cloacal dysgenesis which originates from disruption during gastrulation. We identified 10 case series of mono- or dizygotic twins who were discordant either for fetal megacystis or for cloacal dysgenesis. Issues like conception, zygosity, sex, karyotype and aetiology of fetal megacystis were not reported in all cases. Discordance between monozygotic twins for structural birth defects is closely linked to the twinning process itself. Assisted reproduction is said to generate a higher rate of monozygotic twin pregnancies and to be responsible for a higher prevalence of chromosomal aberrations or congenital malformations. With regard to conception, zygosity, sex, karyotype and combination of malformations, our case is unique.",

    "abstract": "Associations between long-term physical activity and cortical function and brain structure are poorly known. Our aim was to assess whether brain functional and/or structural modulation associated with long-term physical activity is detectable using a discordant monozygotic male twin pair design. Nine monozygotic male twin pairs were carefully selected for an intrapair difference in their leisure-time physical activity of at least three years duration (mean age 34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0years). We registered somatosensory mismatch response (SMMR) in EEG to electrical stimulation of fingers and whole brain MR images. We obtained exercise history and measured physical fitness and body composition. Equivalent electrical dipole sources of SMMR as well as gray matter (GM) voxel counts in regions of interest indicated by source analysis were evaluated. SMMR dipolar source strengths differed between active and inactive twins within twin pairs in postcentral gyrus, medial frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus and in anterior cingulate (AC) GM voxel counts differed similarly. Compared to active twins, their inactive twin brothers showed greater dipole strengths in short periods of the deviant-elicited SMMR and larger AC GM voxel counts. Stronger activation in early unattended cortical processing of the deviant sensory signals in inactive co-twins may imply less effective gating of somatosensory information in inactive twins compared to their active brothers. Present findings indicate that already in 30's long-term physical activity pattern is linked with specific brain indices, both in functional and structural domains.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is commonly investigated as a potential risk factor for low back pain (LBP); however, current evidence remains unclear. Limitations in previous studies may explain the inconsistent results in the field, such as the use of a cross sectional design, limitations in the measures used to assess obesity (eg, body mass index-BMI), and poor adjustment for confounders (eg, genetics and physical activity).\nTo better understand the effects of obesity on LBP, our aim was to investigate in a prospective cohort whether obesity-related measures increase the risk of chronic LBP outcomes using a longitudinal design. We assessed obesity through measures that consider the magnitude as well as the distribution of body fat mass. A within-pair twin case-control analysis was used to control for the possible effects of genetic and early shared environmental factors on the obesity-LBP relationship.\nData were obtained from the Murcia Twin Registry in Spain. Participants were 1,098 twins, aged 43 to 71 years, who did not report chronic LBP at baseline. Follow-up data on chronic LBP (>6 months), activity-limiting LBP, and care-seeking for LBP were collected after 2 to 4 years.\nThe risk factors were BMI, percentage of fat mass, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio.\nSequential analyses were performed using logistic regression controlling for familial confounding: (1) total sample analysis (twins analyzed as independent individuals); (2) within-pair twin case-control analyses (all complete twin pairs discordant for LBP at follow-up); and within-pair twin case-control analyses separated for (3) dizygotic and (4) monozygotic twins.\nNo increase in the risk of chronic LBP was found for any of the obesity-related measures: BMI (men/women, odds ratio [OR]: 0.99; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.86-1.14), % fat mass (women, OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.66-1.14), waist circumference (women, OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.74-1.30), and waist-to-hip ratio (women, OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.81-1.36). Similar results were found for activity-limiting LBP and care-seeking due to LBP. After the adjustment for genetics and early environmental factors shared by twins, the non-significant results remained unchanged.\nAfter 2 to 4 years, obesity-related measures did not increase the risk of developing chronic LBP or care-seeking for LBP with or without adjustment for familial factors such as genetics in Spanish adults.",

    "abstract": "Compared to families with IVF singletons, what are parental depressive, parent-adolescent interaction and adolescent adjustment outcomes in families with 11-17-year-old IVF twins?\nNo differences were detected for any measured outcome between families with 11-17-year-old IVF twins and those with IVF singletons, despite high statistical power.\nWhen IVF twins are younger than 5-years-old, parents tend to have more mental health difficulties and poorer parent-child interactions relative to IVF singletons. By middle childhood, these differences may no longer exist and available studies with middle childhood-aged IVF twins challenge the expected long-term implications of the early concerns. IVF twins may even have more optimum adjustment than IVF singletons in middle childhood.\nStudy of 280, 11-17-year-old IVF children (n\u00a0=\u00a0122 twins and n\u00a0=\u00a0158 singletons) from 195 families at a US reproductive endocrinology clinic.\nAt Wave 1, clinic patients with an IVF child born between 1998 and 2004 were invited to participate in an online survey. In this follow-up study, mothers and fathers provided information on each of their 11-17-year-old IVF adolescents.\nThere were no differences between 11- and 17-year-old IVF twins and IVF singletons in parent depressive symptoms, parent-adolescent interactions or adolescent adjustment outcomes.\nAlthough the family demographics are representative of\u00a0IVF patients, participants were drawn from one US clinic.\nStudy results provide reassurance that by adolescence IVF twins and their families function as well as IVF singletons and their families.\nUniversity of Minnesota (UMN) Agriculture Experiment Station (MN-52-107), UMN Grant-in-Aid of Research, Artistry and Scholarship, UMN College of Education and Human Development Research Development Investment Grant, UMN Women's Philosophic Leadership Circle Award, UMN Eva Miller Endowed Fellowship.

    "abstract": "To compare maternal, obstetric, and neonatal outcomes between women who underwent oocyte donation at or after age 50\u00a0years and from 45 through 49\u00a0years.\nSingle-center, retrospective cohort study.\nMaternity hospital.\nForty women aged 50\u00a0years and older (\"older group\") and 146 aged 45-49\u00a0years (\"younger group\").\nComparison between the older and younger groups, globally and after stratification by type of pregnancy (singleton/twin pregnancy).\nMaternal, obstetric, and neonatal outcomes.\nThe rate of multiple-gestation pregnancies was similar in both groups (35% in the older and 37.7% in the younger group). We observed no significant difference globally between the two groups for outcomes, except for the mean duration of postpartum hospitalization, which was significantly longer among the older women (mean \u00b1 SD, 9.5 \u00b1 7.4\u00a0days vs. 6.8 \u00b1 4.4\u00a0days). The rates of isolated pregnancy-related hypertension and of fetal growth restriction in singleton pregnancies were statistically higher in the older than in the younger group (19.2% vs. 5.5%, and 30.7% vs. 14.3%, respectively). Complication rates with twin pregnancies were similar between groups and very high compared with singleton pregnancies.\nComplication rates were similar among women aged 50\u00a0years and older and those aged 45-49\u00a0years. Nonetheless, given the high rate of complication in both groups, especially among twin pregnancies, single embryo transfer needs to be encouraged for oocyte donations after age 45\u00a0years.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of BMI on late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) of the coronary artery wall in identical monozygous twins discordant for BMI. Coronary LGE represents a useful parameter for the detection and quantification of atherosclerotic coronary vessel wall disease.\nThirteen monozygote female twin pairs (n\u2009=\u200926) with significantly different BMIs (>1.6\u00a0kg/m2) were recruited out of >10,000 twin pairs (TwinsUK Registry). A coronary 3D-T2prep-TFE MR angiogram and 3D-IR-TFE vessel wall scan were performed prior to and following the administration of 0.2\u00a0mmol/kg of Gd-DTPA on a 1.5\u00a0T MR scanner. The number of enhancing coronary segments and contrast to noise ratios (CNRs) of the coronary wall were quantified.\nAn increase in BMI was associated with an increased number of enhancing coronary segments (5.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 vs. 3.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and increased coronary wall enhancement (6.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 vs. 4.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9, p\u2009=\u20090.0027) compared to matched twins with lower BMI.\nThis study in monozygous twins indicates that acquired factors predisposing to obesity, including lifestyle and environmental factors, result in increased LGE of the coronary arteries, potentially reflecting an increase in coronary atherosclerosis in this female study population.\n\u2022 BMI-discordant twins allow the investigation of the influence of lifestyle factors independent from genetic confounders. \u2022 Only thirteen obesity-discordant twins were identified underlining the strong genetic component of BMI. \u2022 In female twins, a BMI increase is associated with increased coronary late gadolinium enhancement. \u2022 Increased late gadolinium enhancement in the coronary vessel wall potentially reflects increased atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disruption and shift work have been associated with cancer risk, but epidemiologic evidence for prostate cancer remains limited. We aimed to prospectively investigate the association between midlife sleep- and circadian-related parameters and later prostate cancer risk and mortality in a population-based cohort of Finnish twins.\nData were drawn from the Older Finnish Twin Cohort and included 11,370 twins followed from 1981 to 2012. Over the study period, 602 incident cases of prostate cancer and 110 deaths from prostate cancer occurred. Cox regression was used to evaluate associations between midlife sleep duration, sleep quality, chronotype, and shift work with prostate cancer risk and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Within-pair co-twin analyses were employed to account for potential familial confounding.\nCompared to \"definite morning\" types, \"somewhat evening\" types had a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer (HR 1.3; 95\u00a0% CI 1.1, 1.6). Chronotype significantly modified the relationship between shift work and prostate cancer risk (p-interaction <0.001). We found no significant association between sleep duration, sleep quality, or shift work and prostate cancer risk in the overall analyses and no significant association between any sleep- or circadian-related parameter and risk in co-twin analyses. Neither sleep- nor circadian-related parameters were significantly associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality.\nThe association between sleep disruption, chronotype, and shift work with prostate cancer risk and mortality has never before been studied in a prospective study of male twins. Our findings suggest that chronotype may be associated with prostate cancer risk and modify the association between shift work and prostate cancer risk. Future studies of circadian disruption and prostate cancer should account for this individual-level characteristic.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) present with profound fatigue, flu-like symptoms, pain, cognitive impairment, orthostatic intolerance, and post-exertional malaise (PEM), and exacerbation of some or all of the baseline symptoms. CASE REPORT We report on a pair of 34-year-old monozygotic twins discordant for ME/CFS, with WELL, the non-affected twin, and ILL, the affected twin. Both twins performed a two-day cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), pre- and post-exercise blood samples were drawn, and both provided stool samples for biochemical and molecular analysis. At peak exertion for both CPETs, ILL presented lower VO2peak and peak workload compared to WELL. WELL demonstrated normal reproducibility of VO2@ventilatory/anaerobic threshold (VAT) during \u00a0CPET2, whereas ILL experienced an abnormal reduction of 13% in VAT during \u00a0CPET2. A normal rise in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, creatinine, and ferritin content was observed following exercise for both WELL and ILL at each CPET. ILL showed higher increases of resistin, soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) after exercise compared to WELL. The gut bacterial microbiome and virome were examined and revealed a lower microbial diversity in ILL compared to WELL, with fewer beneficial bacteria such as Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium, and an expansion of bacteriophages belonging to the tailed dsDNA Caudovirales order.\u00a0 CONCLUSIONS Results suggest dysfunctional immune activation in ILL following exercise and that prokaryotic viruses may contribute to mucosal inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis. Therefore, a two-day CPET and molecular analysis of blood and microbiomes could provide valuable information about ME/CFS, particularly if applied to a larger cohort of monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Our study examines the contribution of genetic and environmental factors (both shared and unique) to frailty, measured using the Rockwood Frailty Index (FI) in a sample of twins from the St Thomas' UK Adult Twin Registry. The FI was based on 39 items of potential health deficit. Study participants were 3,375 volunteer adult twins (840 monozygotic and 802 dizygotic twin-pairs) 40.0-84.5 years old. First, we used structural equation modeling to estimate the relative contribution of genetics and of the shared and unique environment to variance in FI adjusted for age. In a second analysis, multiple linear regression was used to examine variance in FI as a function of father's occupational class (a component of shared environment and a measure of childhood socioeconomic status [SES]), adjusting for age, birth weight, marital status, and health behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity). Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS\u00ae Version 22 software and Mx open source software. Findings showed that 45% (95% confidence intervals [CIs] 30-53%) of the inter-individual variation in FI was heritable and 52% (95% CIs 47-57%) was due to the individual's unique environment. Multiple linear regression also showed a small but statistically significant inverse association between father's occupational class and FI, mediated by one's own educational attainment and birth weight. Our results indicate that frailty is both genetically and environmentally determined. Thus, its prevention and management call for a multifaceted approach that includes addressing deleterious environmental factors, some of which, like childhood SES, may act across the life course.",

    "abstract": "Increased medically assisted reproduction (MAR) use to treat infertility has resulted in a growing twin birth rate. Little is known about parent-child relationships for twin relative to singleton children in middle childhood. This study fills this gap by examining parent-child relationships in 57 families with eighty 6- to 12-year-old MAR twin and singleton children using observational data (warm and supportive communication, control, and hostility). Nested ANCOVAs indicate that while mothers exhibit similar interactional behaviors toward twins and singletons, fathers have less optimum behaviors toward twins relative to singletons. Twins displayed less engaged behavior with mothers and fathers relative to singletons. Given the vitality of parent-child relationships for family and child adjustment, future studies should examine determinants and outcomes of twin-singleton relationship differences to bolster twins' and their families' functioning.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have elucidated the genetics of Parkinson's disease; however, the aetiology of the majority of sporadic cases has not yet been resolved. We hypothesized that epigenetic variations could be associated with PD and evaluated the DNA methylation pattern in PD patients compared to brothers or twins without PD. The methylation of DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 62 discordant siblings including 24 monozygotic twins was characterized with Illumina DNA Methylation 450K bead arrays and subsequently validated in two independent cohorts: 221 PD vs. 227 healthy individuals (cohort 1) applying Illumina's VeraCode and 472 PD patients vs. 487 controls (cohort 2) using pyrosequencing. We choose a delta beta of >15\u00a0% and selected 62 differentially methylated CpGs in 51 genes from the discordant siblings. Among them, three displayed multiple CpGs per gene: microRNA 886 (MIR886, 10 CpGs), phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D, 2 CpGs) and tripartite motif-containing 34 (TRIM34, 2 CpGs). PDE4D was confirmed in both cohorts (p value 2.44e-05). In addition, for biomarker construction, we used the penalized logistic regression model, resulting in a signature of eight CpGs with an AUC of 0.77. Our findings suggest that a distinct level of PD susceptibility stems from individual, epigenetic modifications of specific genes. We identified a signature of CpGs in blood cells that could separate control from disease with a reasonable discriminatory power, holding promise for future epigenetically based biomarker development.",

    "abstract": "Alterations to cognitive function are often reported with depression and anxiety symptoms, yet few studies have examined the same associations with mental well-being. This study examined the association between mental well-being, depression and anxiety symptoms and cognitive function in 1502 healthy adult monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, and the shared/unique contribution of genetic (G) and environmental (E) variance. Using linear mixed models, mental well-being was positively associated (p\u2009<\u2009.01) with sustained attention (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.127), inhibition (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.096), cognitive flexibility (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.149), motor coordination (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.114) and working memory (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.156), whereas depression and anxiety symptoms were associated (p\u2009<\u2009.01) with poorer sustained attention (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.134), inhibition (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.139), cognitive flexibility (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.116) and executive function (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.139). Bivariate twin modelling showed well-being shared a small environmental correlation with motor coordination and a small genetic correlation with working memory. Trivariate twin modelling showed well-being shared a small genetic correlation with inhibition, whereas depression and anxiety symptoms shared a small environmental correlation with inhibition. The remaining variance was mostly driven by unique G and/or E variance. Overall, well-being and depression and anxiety symptoms show both independent and shared relationships with cognitive functions but this is largely attributable to unique G or E variance and small shared G/E variance between pairs of variables.",

    "abstract": "There is limited research on the genetic and environmental bases of psychopathic personality traits in children. In this study, psychopathic personality traits were assessed in a total of 1189 5-year-old boys and girls drawn from the Preschool Twin Study in Sweden. Psychopathic personality traits were assessed with the Child Problematic Traits Inventory, a teacher-report measure of psychopathic personality traits in children ranging from 3 to 12\u00a0years old. Univariate results showed that genetic influences accounted for 57, 25, and 74\u00a0% of the variance in the grandiose-deceitful, callous-unemotional, and impulsive-need for stimulation dimensions, while the shared environment accounted for 17, 48 and 9\u00a0% (n.s.) in grandiose-deceitful and callous-unemotional, impulsive-need for stimulation dimensions, respectively. No sex differences were found in the genetic and environmental variance components. The non-shared environment accounted for the remaining 26, 27 and 17\u00a0% of the variance, respectively. The three dimensions of psychopathic personality were moderately correlated (0.54-0.66) and these correlations were primarily mediated by genetic and shared environmental factors. In contrast to research conducted with adolescent and adult twins, we found that both genetic and shared environmental factors influenced psychopathic personality traits in early childhood. These findings indicate that etiological models of psychopathic personality traits would benefit by taking developmental stages and processes into consideration.",

    "abstract": "Acral pseudolymphomatous angiokeratoma of children (APACHE) is a condition that was first described in 1990 in a group of children, but has since been described in adults. We present the cases of identical twin patients aged 40\u00a0years. The first brother presented with an 8-year history of itchy lesions over the left ankle and the insteps of both feet. After a diagnostic biopsy, he was treated with potent steroids under occlusion for 8\u00a0weeks, which resulted in flattening of the lesions and resolution of the pruritus. The second twin had a 20-year history of a very similar presentation but the lesions were less pronounced; he chose not to have treatment. No other family members were affected. Skin biopsies from both patients showed similar changes. Within an overall hyperkeratotic and acanthotic epidermis, there were focal areas of lichenoid change and epidermal thinning. Beneath these areas, there was oedema and nodular aggregates of dense inflammatory cell infiltrate, predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate. APACHE has not been previously described in twins.",

    "abstract": "Keratocystic Odontogenic Tumour (KCOT) is unicystic or multicystic intraosseous benign tumour of odontogenic origin that recurs due to locally destructive behaviour. KCOTs are usually the first manifestation of Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS), an autosomal dominant disorder also known as Gorlin's syndrome and they are most frequently observed familial symptom regardless of patients' nationality. In addition, the recurrence rate and multiplicity of KCOTs is relatively high as compared to that of other sporadic carcinomas. KCOT has been considered as a non-hereditary lesion and its familial onset is an extremely rare event in non-NBCCS cases. Here, we describe previously unreported non-syndromic multiple KCOT cases in identical twins in a Japanese family. The subjects were female Japanese identical twins who were 26 and 27 years old, respectively, at the time of diagnosis for KCOT. They had no major or minor features of NBCCS other than KCOT. Although there were lesions that were likely to be dentigerous cysts based on radiographic findings, one of them was KCOT. This case report highlights the importance of precise diagnosis, choice of surgical method and careful observation for multiplicity or familial onset in sporadic KCOT cases without NBCCS.",

    "abstract": "The high prevalence of prematurity and low birth-weight places twin infants at increased risk for sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) and/or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Risk for these SUID and SIDS is affected by a combination of nonmodifiable intrinsic risk factors and modifiable extrinsic stressors including infant care practices related to sleep. Although adherence to the full scope of American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2011 recommendations is intended to decrease risk, these recommendations are aimed at singleton infants and may require tailoring for families with multiple infants.\nThe study describes infant care practices reported by mothers of twins in the first 6 months postpartum.\nMothers caring for twin infants (N = 35) were surveyed online both longitudinally (at 2, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after infant hospital discharge) and cross-sectionally. AAP recommendations (2011) guided survey content.\nThe degree of adherence to AAP recommendations varied over time. For example, mothers of twins reported 100% adherence to placing twins supine for sleep initially, but many reported putting babies on their stomachs for naps as twins became older. Sharing a parent's bedroom decreased over time as did frequency of crib sharing. Fewer than half of mothers offered a pacifier most or all of the time for sleep.\nOpportunities exist for development of an educational program geared specifically for postpartum parents of twins.\nBarriers affecting adherence to AAP recommendations and effectiveness of educational programs addressing needs of this unique population need further exploration.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have been done on infant feeding practices but few have focused on twins. The aim of this study was to compare the complementary feeding practices between mothers with twins and mothers with singletons.\nMother-infant pairs (50 mother-twin pairs and 50 mother-singleton pairs) with children aged 6 to 23 months were recruited from two public health clinics and communities in Tema and Ashaiman. Information was collected on the background characteristics of the mothers. Recumbent length and weight of the children were measured. Dietary information on the infants was collected using 24 hour recall. The differences between two groups were tested using independent t-student test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables.\nThe minimum dietary diversity (4+ food groups) was met by only 32% of the twins and 40% of the singletons, and 28% of the twins and 38% of the singletons met the requirement for minimum acceptable diet (minimum dietary diversity and the minimum meal frequency). Minimum meal frequency was met by 78% of the twins and 76% of the singletons. There were no significant differences between the two groups of infants. Prevalence of undernutrition was not significantly different among the two groups (twins versus singletons: underweight-26% versus 24%, stunting-20% versus 24% and wasting-14% versus 10%.\nComplementary feeding practices were suboptimal in both groups of mothers requiring interventions to improve infant feeding practices.",

    "abstract": "Longitudinal twin studies on long term conservation of individual metabolic phenotypes can help to explore the genetic and environmental basis in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and metabolic health. We performed a longitudinal twin study on 12 metabolic phenotypes from Danish twins followed up for 12 years and Chinese twins traced for 7 years. The study covered a relatively large sample of 502 pairs of Danish adult twins with a mean age at intake of 38 years and a total of 181 Chinese adult twin pairs with a mean baseline age of 39.5 years. Bivariate twin models were fitted to the longitudinal measurements taken at two time points (at baseline and follow-up) to estimate the genetic and environmental contributions to phenotype variation and correlation at and between the two time points. High genetic components in the regulation of intra-individual phenotype correlation or stability over time were estimated in both Danish (h2>0.75 except fasting blood glucose) and Chinese (h2>0.72 except blood pressure) twins; moderate to high genetic contribution to phenotype variation at the two time points were also estimated except for the low genetic regulation on glucose in Danish and on blood pressure in Chinese twins. Meanwhile the bivariate twin models estimated shared environmental contributions to the variance and covariance in fasting blood glucose in Danish twins, and in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low and high density lipoprotein cholesterol in Chinese twins. Overall, our longitudinal twin study on long-term stability of metabolic phenotypes in Danish and Chinese twins identified a common pattern of high genetic control over phenotype conservation, and at the same time revealed population-specific patterns of genetic and common environmental regulation on the variance as well as covariance of glucose and blood pressure.",

    "abstract": "The neurobiological mechanisms mediating an increased risk to develop affective disorders remain poorly understood. In a group of individuals with a family history of major depressive (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD), we investigated the microstructural properties of white matter fiber tracts, that is, cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, anterior limb of the internal capsule, and corpus callosum, that facilitate the communication between brain regions implicated in affective disorders.\nEighty-nine healthy mono- or dizygotic twins with a co-twin diagnosed with MDD or BD (high-risk) and 57 healthy twins with a co-twin with no familial history of affective disorders (low-risk) were included in a diffusion tensor imaging study.\nThe high-risk group showed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of water diffusion directionality, and increased radial diffusivity in the anterior region of corpus callosum compared to the low-risk group. This abnormality was not associated with zygosity or type of depressive disorder of co-twin.\nThe observed decreased anterior callosal fiber FA in the high-risk group may be indicative of a compromised interhemispheric communication between left and right frontal regions critically involved in mood regulation. Reduced anterior callosal FA may act as a vulnerability marker for affective disorders in individuals at familial risk.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate if inter-twin estimated fetal weight (EFW) differences at 21-24 weeks' scans predict birth weight discordance in monochorionic and dichorionic twins born at three gestational age periods.\nWe counted the number of pairs with discordant EFWs (EFWs greater than the mean\u2009+\u20091SD; i.e. a difference above 12% in dichorionic and 21% in monochorionic twins) derived during a 21-24 weeks' scan as compared to actual discordant birth weight (>25%) in monochorionic and dichorionic pairs born at \u226432, 33-36 and >36 weeks.\nWe studied 416 dichorionic and 244 monochorionic twins. The frequency of EFWs discordance at 21-24 weeks was the same for dichorionic and monochorionic twins but the total number of birth weight discordant pairs was significantly smaller among dichorionic twins (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1, 0.6). Generally, the positive predictive values for birth weight discordance by using the EFWs difference were quite poor, but always better in monochorionic than in dichorionic twins. Whereas the negative predictive value and hence the sensitivity for monochorionic twins was 100% irrespective of gestational age at birth, it was much lower in the dichorionic pairs.\nConcordant EFWs at 21-24 weeks exclude discordant birth weight in monochorionic twins whereas discordant EFWs are poor predictors of birth weight discordance especially in dichorionic twins irrespective when the twins were born.",

The frequency of EFWs discordance at 21-24 weeks was the same for dichorionic and monochorionic twins but the total number of birth weight discordant pairs was significantly smaller among dichorionic twins (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1, 0.6). Generally, the positive predictive values for birth weight discordance by using the EFWs difference were quite poor, but always better in monochorionic than in dichorionic twins. Whereas the negative predictive value and hence the sensitivity for monochorionic twins was 100% irrespective of gestational age at birth, it was much lower in the dichorionic pairs.",

    "abstract": "Early colonization of gut microbiota in human gut is a complex process. It remains unclear when gut microbiota colonization occurs and how it proceeds. In order to study gut microbiota composition in human early life, the present study recruited 10 healthy pairs of twins, including five monozygotic (MZ) and five dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, whose age ranged from 0 to 6 years old. 20 fecal samples from these twins were processed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and their averaged data outputs were generated as 2G per sample. We used MEGAN5 to perform taxonomic and functional annotation of the metagenomic data, and systematically analyzed those 20 samples, including Jaccard index similarity, principle component, clustering, and correlation analyses. Our findings indicated that within our study group: 1) MZ-twins share more microbes than DZ twins or non-twin pairs, 2) gut microbiota distribution is relatively stable at metabolic pathways level, 3) age represents the strongest factor that can account for variation in gut microbiota, and 4) a clear metabolic pathway shift can be observed, which speculatively occurs around the age of 1 year old. This research will serve as a base for future studies of gut microbiota-related disease research.",

    "abstract": "Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is considered an autosomal dominant condition, which is commonly associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm. Both conditions pose the risk of valvular and aortic complications not only for affected patients but also for genetically related persons as well. The genetic underpinnings of these disease processes, which are in various stages of elucidation, have implications for screening and risk prognostication.\nTo analyze genetic differences between 2 pairs of monozygotic twins that had discordant aortic valve morphology, with 1 twin in each pair having a BAV and the other having a trileaflet aortic valve.\nTwo pairs of twins that were objectively determined to be monozygotic were examined at a tertiary care medical center associated with an academic medical center. Aortic valves that were surgically excised for clinical indications were examined for morphology. Whole-exome sequencing was performed for the twin pair that had discordance of aortic valve and aortic aneurysm. In the second pair, targeted gene sequencing of 25 genes known to be associated with BAV and/or thoracic aortic aneurysm was performed. In each pair, the twin with a BAV underwent surgical aortic valve replacement for clinical indications.\nGenetic coding variations between monozygotic twins using whole-exome sequencing and targeted gene sequencing.\nThis case series included 2 pairs of male monozygotic twins; one pair was aged 51 years and the other aged 59 years. Genetic sequencing methods identified no pathogenic sequence changes between the twins in each pair.\nOur findings challenge the traditional view of BAV as a condition with an entirely autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and emphasize the variability of penetrance of both BAV and thoracic aortic aneurysm as well as the variability of the association of the 2 conditions. Continued work to elucidate the genetic basis may lead to the refinement of risk stratification for affected patients and relatives.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasonography is an essential tool in the management of twin pregnancies. Fetal weight estimation is useful to anticipate neonatal care in case of weight restriction or growth discordance.\nTo assess the accuracy of estimated fetal weight (EFW) in twins and to assess the accuracy of sonographic examination to predict birth weight discordance (BWD) and small birth weight (SBW).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Methods : This was\u00a0 a longitudinal prospective study over a period of one year. We have included 50 twin pregnancies with a first trimester ultrasound calculated term and specified chorionicity. An ultrasound EFW was scheduled for all patients within an interval of 4 days before delivery. We calculated the differences between EFW and BW in terms of absolute difference and percentage error. We studied the correlation and the agreement between EFW and BW. Finally we calculated the sensitivity, the specificity, PPV and NPV of ultrasound in the diagnosis of BWD and SBW.\nAbsolute differences between BWF and BW were similar for the two twins. The relative difference was 7.7% [0-32] for T1 and 8.2% [0-27] for T2. The margin of error was greater than 10% in 38% of the cases for T1 and in 34% of cases for T2. Furthermore, correlation coefficients R1 and R2 for T1 and T2 were close to 1; R 1 =0.87 and\u00a0 R 2 = 0.89. Linear regression analysis allowed us to calculate the birth weight based on the estimated weight and this according to the following equations: For the first twin BW T1 = 0.846 * EFW 415,57+ T1 For the second twin BW T2 = 65.68 + 0.963 * EFW T2 in 34% of cases for T2. Chorionicity, presentation and gestational age did not affect the estimations. Ultrasonography in the diagnosis of SBW had a sensitivity of 90.32%, a specificity of 76.82%, a (PPV) of 80% and a (VPN) of 87%. The performance of ultrasound in the diagnosis of BWD varied according to the adopted threshold.\nUltrasound is an effective examination to estimate twins weight. Regarding prenatal diagnosis of birth weight discordance, the relevance of this examination increases with the adopted threshold.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation levels will be important for detection of epigenetic effects. However, there are few reports showing sex-related differences in the sensitivity to DNA methylation. To evaluate their sex-related individual differences in the sensitivity to methylation rigorously, we performed a systematic analysis of DNA methylation in monozygotic twins, an optimal model to evaluate them because the genetic backgrounds are the same.\nWe examined 30 male and 43 female older monozygotic twin pairs recruited from the registry established by the Center for Twin Research, Osaka University. Their methylation levels were determined using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Kit (Illumina), which interrogated 485577 highly informative CpG sites at the single-nucleotide resolution, and the median methylation level was calculated for each of the 25657 CpG islands. Within-pair differences of methylation levels (WPDMs) were greater in male pairs than female pairs for 86.0\u00a0% of autosomal CpG islands, but were higher in female pairs than male pairs for 76.7\u00a0% of X chromosomal CpG islands. Mean WPDMs of CpG islands in each autosomal chromosome were significantly higher in male pairs than in female whereas that in X chromosome was significantly higher in female pairs than in male. Multiple comparison indicated that WPDMs in three autosomal and two X-chromosomal CpG islands were significantly greater in male pairs, whereas those in 22 X-chromosomal CpG islands were significantly greater in female pairs.\nSex-related differences were present in the WPDMs of CpG islands in individuals with the same genetic background. These differences may be associated with the sexual influences in susceptibility of some diseases.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic-diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies are high risk, due to twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), twin anaemia polycythaemia sequence (TAPS) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). There is limited evidence to guide ultrasound surveillance protocols. Using a retrospective cohort, we aimed to provide insight into the optimal interval of ultrasound surveillance.\nRetrospective cohort of women with MCDA pregnancies who received antenatal care at Monash Medical Centre (January 2011-October 2014). We reviewed all ultrasounds from \u226515 weeks' gestation and collected perinatal outcomes.\nA total of 162 women with MCDA pregnancies attended our care. Six women were excluded due to late referral. Of the remaining 156, 55% were uncomplicated. TTTS, TAPS, IUGR and fetal demise in utero occurred in 9%, 1%, 31% and 2%, respectively. Median interval between the last ultrasound and TTTS diagnosis was 3.1 weeks (IQR 0.8-5.8). There was a trend towards a longer interval for cases with advanced TTTS compared to early TTTS. Interval between ultrasound scans was longer in cases with unexplained fetal demise in utero and advanced TTTS than early TTTS [3.4 weeks (IQR 2.0-6.9) vs. 0.9 weeks (IQR 0.4-3.7); p < 0.05].\nOur observations support current recommendations for fortnightly ultrasound surveillance in MCDA pregnancies from 16 weeks' gestation and suggest that longer intervals may be associated with poorer outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical properties of electrodeposited copper with highly-oriented nanoscale twins were investigated by micropillar compression. Uniform nanotwinned copper films with preferred twin orientations, either vertical or horizontal, were obtained by controlling the plating conditions. In addition, an ultrafine grained copper film was synthesized to be used as a reference sample. The mechanical properties were assessed by in situ SEM microcompression of micropillars fabricated with a focused ion beam. Results show that the mechanical properties are highly sensitive to the twin orientation. When compared to the ultrafine grained sample, an increase of 44% and 130% in stress at 5% offset strain was observed in quasi-static tests for vertically and horizontally aligned twins, respectively. Inversely strain rate jump microcompression testing reveals higher strain sensitivity for vertical twins. These observations are attributed to a change in deformation mechanism from dislocation pile-ups at the twin boundary for horizontal twins to dislocations threading inside the twin lamella for vertical twins.",

The majority of phaeochromocytomas are sporadic, however, about 25-30% are caused by genetic mutation. These tumor are frequently referred as hereditary phaeochromocytomas/paragangliomas. Their incidence increases continuously which can be attributed to availability of genetic examination and to the discovery of novel genes. The 47-year-old female patient underwent abdominal computed tomography which revealed bilateral adrenal gland enlargement. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, the 131-I- metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy, urinary catecholamines and serum chomogranin A measurements confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral phaeochromocytomas. The genetically identical twin sister of the patient was also diagnosed with hormonally active bilateral phaechromocytoma, suggesting the genetic origin of phaeochromocytoma. Mutation screening confirmed a germline mutation of the transmembrane protein 127 tumorsupressor gene in both patients. Both patients underwent cortical-sparing adrenalectomy. The adrenal gland with the larger tumor was totally resected, while in the opposite side only the tumor was resected and a small part of the cortex was saved. After the operation urinary catecholamines and serum chromogranin A returned to normal in both patients. Adrenocortical deficiency was absent in the first patient, but her sister developed adrenal insufficiency requiring glucocorticoid replacement. To the best of the authors' knowledge phaeochromocytoma affecting twins has never been described earlier. Genetic examination performed in siblings confirmed the presence of the mutant gene through four generations. Orv. Hetil., 2016, 157(33), 1326-1330.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined: (1) gender and age differences of mean gender identity disorder (GID) trait scores in Japanese twins; (2) the validity of the prenatal hormone transfer theory, which predicts that, in dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, twins with an opposite-gender co-twin more frequently exhibit GID traits than twins with a same-gender co-twin; and (3) the magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on GID traits as a function of age and gender. Data from 1450 male twin pairs, 1882 female twin pairs, and 1022 DZ male-female pairs ranging from 3 to 26\u00a0years of age were analyzed. To quantify individual variances in GID traits, each participant completed four questionnaire items based on criteria for GID from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). Our most important findings were: (1) Japanese females exhibited GID traits more frequently than males and Japanese children exhibited GID traits less frequently than adolescents and adults (among females, the prevalence was 1.6\u00a0% in children, 10\u00a0% in adolescents, and 12\u00a0% in adults; among males, the prevalence was 0.5, 2, and 3\u00a0%, respectively); (2) the data did not support the prenatal hormone transfer theory for GID traits; and (3) a large part of the variance for GID traits in children was accounted for by familial factors; however, the magnitude was found to be greater in children than in adolescents or adults, particularly among females. This study suggests that although the prevalence is likely to increase, familial effects are likely to decrease as individuals age.",

    "abstract": "To estimate whether antenatal corticosteroids before 34 weeks of gestation are associated with reduced incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and composite neonatal morbidity in preterm twins.\nThis was a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized trial for the prevention of preterm birth in multiple gestations. All liveborn, nonanomalous twins delivered between 24 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation were included. Neonatal outcomes were compared between women who received antenatal corticosteroids and those who did not. The primary outcome was the incidence of RDS. The secondary outcome was the incidence of serious composite neonatal morbidity. Multivariable log Poisson regression with correlation adjustment between twins born to the same mother was performed for confounder control. Adjusted relative risks (RRs) are reported for study outcomes. Based on a post hoc power analysis, this study was powered to detect an RR less than 0.63 for RDS and greater than 1.43 for composite neonatal morbidity outcomes.\nA total of 432 women (850 neonates) were included. Only 300 (35%) neonates were born to women receiving antenatal corticosteroids. After multivariable regression, antenatal corticosteroids were not associated with a reduced incidence of RDS (81 [27%] compared with 92 [17%] neonates, adjusted RR 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-1.71) or composite neonatal morbidity (87 [29%] compared with 108 [20%] neonates, adjusted RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.93-1.56). However, antenatal corticosteroids were associated with increased rates of neonatal intensive care unit admissions (235 [78%] compared with 322 [59%] neonates, adjusted RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09-1.36) and mechanical ventilation (70 [23%] compared with 66 [12%] neonates, adjusted RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.12-2.09). Focusing analysis to newborns delivered before 34 weeks of gestation (n=311), 161 (52%) received antenatal corticosteroids. Similarly, no differences in the rate of RDS (66 [41%] compared with 68 [45%] neonates, adjusted RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76-1.34) or composite neonatal morbidity (72 [45%] compared with 81 [54%] neonates, adjusted RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.74-1.22) were noted.\nIn this cohort of preterm twins, antenatal corticosteroid administration was not associated with a reduced incidence of RDS and composite neonatal morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Education is associated with health related lifestyle choices including leisure-time physical inactivity. However, the longitudinal associations between education and inactivity merit further studies. We investigated the association between education and leisure-time physical inactivity over a 35-year follow-up with four time points controlling for multiple covariates including familial confounding.\nThis study of the population-based Finnish Twin Cohort consisted of 5254 twin individuals born in 1945-1957 (59\u00a0% women), of which 1604 were complete same-sexed twin pairs. Data on leisure-time physical activity and multiple covariates was available from four surveys conducted in 1975, 1981, 1990 and 2011 (response rates 72 to 89\u00a0%). The association between years of education and leisure-time physical inactivity (<1.5 metabolic equivalent hours/day) was first analysed for each survey. Then, the role of education was investigated for 15-year and 35-year inactivity periods in the longitudinal analyses. The co-twin control design was used to analyse the potential familial confounding of the effects. All analyses were conducted with and without multiple covariates. Odds Ratios (OR) with 95\u00a0% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic and conditional (fixed-effects) regression models.\nEach additional year of education was associated with less inactivity (OR 0.94 to 0.95, 95\u00a0% CI 0.92, 0.99) in the cross-sectional age- and sex-adjusted analyses. The associations of education with inactivity in the 15- and 35-year follow-ups showed a similar trend: OR 0.97 (95\u00a0% CI 0.93, 1.00) and OR 0.94 (95 % CI 0.91, 0.98), respectively. In all co-twin control analyses, each year of higher education was associated with a reduced likelihood of inactivity suggesting direct effect (i.e. independent from familial confounding) of education on inactivity. However, the point estimates were lower than in the individual-level analyses. Adjustment for multiple covariates did not change these associations.\nHigher education is associated with lower odds of leisure-time physical inactivity during the three-decade follow-up. The association was found after adjusting for several confounders, including familial factors. Hence, the results point to the conclusion that education has an independent role in the development of long-term physical inactivity and tailored efforts to promote physical activity among lower educated people would be needed throughout adulthood.",

The associations of education with inactivity in the 15- and 35-year follow-ups showed a similar trend: OR 0.97 (95\u00a0% CI 0.93, 1.00) and OR 0.94 (95 % CI 0.91, 0.98), respectively. In all co-twin control analyses, each year of higher education was associated with a reduced likelihood of inactivity suggesting direct effect (i.e. independent from familial confounding) of education on inactivity. However, the point estimates were lower than in the individual-level analyses. Adjustment for multiple covariates did not change these associations.",

    "abstract": "Twins may be at increased risk of dysglycaemic disorders due to adverse fetal conditions. Data from Africa regarding this association is limited. We studied impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and other types of dysglycemia among twins and singletons in Guinea-Bissau.\nThe study was conducted from February 2011 until March 2012 at the Bandim Health Project, a health and demographic surveillance system site in the capital Bissau. Twins (n\u2009=\u2009209) and singletons (n\u2009=\u2009182) were recruited from a previously established cohort. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed, along with anthropometrics and collection of clinical and dietary data.\nMedian age was 16.6 and 14.2\u00a0years between twins and singletons, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.08). Mean birth weight was 2410 vs. 3090\u00a0g, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Twins had higher median fasting- and two hour capillary plasma glucose, 5.4(3.2-8.2) vs. 5.0(3.2-11.5) mmol/L (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and 6.8(3.4-11.3) vs. 6.2(3.2-12.1) mmol/L (P\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively, compared to singletons. The prevalence of IGT was 2.5\u00a0% (5/209) vs. 3.5\u00a0% (6/182) (RR\u2009=\u20090.73, 95 % CI: 0.20-2.64). 12\u00a0% (25/209) of twins had impaired fasting glucose (IFG), compared to 3.5\u00a0% (6/182) of singletons (3.63, 1.53-8.62). Dysglycemia (IGT and/or IFG or overt diabetes) was found in 17\u00a0% (35/209) vs. 9\u00a0% (16/182) (1.90, 1.08-3.37), respectively.\nTwins had higher glucose levels in both the fasting and postprandial state. This may indicate a detrimental effect of the twin fetal environment on glucose metabolism later in life, a result contrary to Scandinavian register studies. The IGT burden was low in this young age group and the risk was similar in twins and singletons.",

    "abstract": "Avoiding overeating and being physically active is associated with healthy aging, but methodological issues challenge the quantification of the association. Intrapair comparison of twins is a study design that attempts to minimize social norm-driven biased self-reporting of lifestyle factors. We aimed to investigate the association between self-reported lifestyle factors and subsequent survival in 347 Danish twin pairs aged 70 years and older and, additionally, to investigate the reliability of these self-reports. The twins were interviewed in 2003 and followed for mortality until 2015. They were asked to compare their appetite and physical activity to that of their co-twins in different stages of life. On an individual level, we found a positive association between current self-reported physical activity and late-life survival for elderly twins. This was supported by the intrapair analyses, which revealed a positive association between midlife and current physical activity and late-life survival. A positive association between lower appetite and late-life survival was found generally over the life course in the individual level analyses but not in the intrapair analyses. Kappa values for the inter-twin agreement on who ate the most were 0.16 to 0.34 in different life stages, and for physical activity 0.19 to 0.26, corresponding to a slight-to-fair agreement. Approximately, 50% of the twin pairs were not in agreement regarding physical activity, and of these twins 75% (95% CI: 67-82%) considered themselves the most active twin. These findings indicate a still-existing tendency of answering according to social norms, even in a twin study designed to minimize this.",

    "abstract": "Mental wellbeing and mental illness symptoms are typically conceptualized as opposite ends of a continuum, despite only sharing about a quarter in common variance. We investigated the normative variation in measures of wellbeing and of depression and anxiety in 1486 twins who did not meet clinical criteria for an overt diagnosis. We quantified the shared versus distinct genetic and environmental variance between wellbeing and depression and anxiety symptoms. The majority of participants (93%) reported levels of depression and anxiety symptoms within the healthy range, yet only 23% reported a wellbeing score within the \"flourishing\" range: the remainder were within the ranges of \"moderate\" (67%) or \"languishing\" (10%). In twin models, measures of wellbeing and of depression and anxiety shared 50.09% of variance due to genetic factors and 18.27% due to environmental factors; the rest of the variance was due to unique variation impacting wellbeing or depression and anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest that an absence of clinically-significant symptoms of depression and anxiety does not necessarily indicate that an individual is flourishing. Both unique and shared genetic and environmental factors may determine why some individuals flourish in the absence of symptoms while others do not.",

    "abstract": "Milk provides a significant source of calcium, protein, vitamins and other minerals to Western populations throughout life. Due to its widespread use, the metabolic and health impact of milk consumption warrants further investigation and biomarkers would aid epidemiological studies.\nMilk intake assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire was analyzed against fasting blood metabolomic profiles from two metabolomic platforms in females from the TwinsUK cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a03559). The top metabolites were then replicated in two independent populations (EGCUT, n\u00a0=\u00a01109 and KORA, n\u00a0=\u00a01593), and the results from all cohorts were meta-analyzed.\nFour metabolites were significantly associated with milk intake in the TwinsUK cohort after adjustment for multiple testing (P\u00a0<\u00a08.08\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\nWe identified and replicated in independent populations four novel biomarkers of milk intake: trimethyl-N-aminovalerate, uridine, hydroxysphingomyelin C14:1 and diacylphosphatidylcholine C28:1.

    "abstract": "Twin studies have estimated the relative contribution of genes and the environment to variance in exercise behavior and it is known that parental education positively affects exercise levels. This study investigates the role of parental education as a potential modifier of variance in exercise behavior from age 7 to 18\u00a0years. The study is based on large datasets from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR: N\u00a0=\u00a024\u00a0874 twins; surveys around the ages of 7, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18\u00a0years) and two Finnish twin cohorts (FinnTwin12: N\u00a0=\u00a04399; 12, 14 and 17\u00a0years; FinnTwin16: N\u00a0=\u00a04648; 16, 17 and 18\u00a0years). Regular participation in moderate-to-vigorous exercise activities during leisure time was assessed by survey. Parental education was dichotomized (\"both parents with a low education\" vs \"at least one parent with a high education\"). The mean in exercise behavior tended to be higher and the variance tended to be lower in children of high educated parents. Evidence for gene-by-environment interaction was weak. To develop successful interventions that specifically target children of low educated parents, the mechanisms causing the mean and variance differences between the two groups should be better understood.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the rate of pulmonary stenosis and functional pulmonary atresia (PS/PA) in recipient twins prior to fetal surgery for twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and their pre- and postnatal outcomes.\nWe carried out a prospective study including 260 cases of TTTS. Echocardiography was performed before laser surgery to detect the presence of PS/PA. The outcomes of recipients with and without PS/PA were compared. The need of postnatal cardiac interventions and the survival rate at 6 months of age were also evaluated.\nPS was observed in 16/260 (6.2%) of recipient twins and PA in 12/260 (4.6%). After fetal surgery, 10/28 (35.7%) recipients died, 9/28 (32.1%) showed in utero regression, and 9/28 (32.1%) had persistence of PS/PA. Postnatally, seven recipients underwent percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty, one required surgical valvotomy and one palliative surgery. Pregnancies with recipient twins with PS/PA had lower survival of at least one twin (67.9 vs. 83.6%, p = 0.045) and lower overall survival (57.1 vs. 72.8%, p = 0.015) at 6 months of age.\nPS and PA were observed in 10.8% of recipients. Among these, about one third showed persistence of pulmonary valve pathology after delivery, which stresses the need for strict follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Racial disparities in education in Brazil (and elsewhere) are well documented. Because this research typically examines educational variation between individuals in different families, however, it cannot disentangle whether racial differences in education are due to racial discrimination or to structural differences in unobserved neighborhood and family characteristics. To address this common data limitation, we use an innovative within-family twin approach that takes advantage of the large sample of Brazilian adolescent twins classified as different races in the 1982 and 1987-2009 Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domic\u00edlios. We first examine the contexts within which adolescent twins in the same family are labeled as different races to determine the characteristics of families crossing racial boundaries. Then, as a way to hold constant shared unobserved and observed neighborhood and family characteristics, we use twins fixed-effects models to assess whether racial disparities in education exist between twins and whether such disparities vary by gender. We find that even under this stringent test of racial inequality, the nonwhite educational disadvantage persists and is especially pronounced for nonwhite adolescent boys.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether routine measurement of cervical length (CL) by transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) in twin pregnancies can enable identification of women who will give birth before 34 weeks and require antenatal corticosteroids (ACSs), and whether it can limit their administration to women who will give birth later.\nRetrospective comparative study in two tertiary referral centers in France. Women with twin gestations followed in two tertiary university hospital maternity units and who delivered from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009 were included. In one center, TVU was targeted to women with cases of suspected preterm labor, while the other center used it monthly for all twin pregnancies. The main outcome measure was the administration of a full course of ACS to twins delivered before 34 weeks.\nTwo hundred and seventy women were eligible in the \"targeted use\" group, and 296 women in the \"routine use\" group. The rate of administration of at least one full course of ACS for twins born before 34 weeks did not differ between the two groups (85.0% in the targeted use group and 90.0% in the routine use group, P=0.40), but the rate of such administration for those born after 34 weeks was lower in the targeted use group (25.7% vs. 81.2%, P<0.01). On adjusting for confounders using logistic regression modeling, no significant difference in ACS administration before 34 weeks was found between the two groups [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.39-1.30].\nRoutine monitoring performed every month of CL with TVU does not affect the rate of administration of ACS to twins born before 34 weeks, but is associated with a higher rate of such administration for those born later in the specific center of the study.",

    "abstract": "Literature suggests that male hormones influence fetal growth in singleton pregnancies. We hypothesized that the same phenomenon is seen in twin gestations.\n(1) to identify the impact of gender associated with fetal birth weight, head circumference, and birth length for twins; (2) to examine the effect of gender on standardized fetal growth at birth, according to gestational age and birth order; (3) to examine the effect of gender on placenta weight and dimensions.\nThis was a population-based retrospective cohort study of twins (4,368 twins, 2,184 pairs) born in British Columbia, Canada from 2000-2010. We excluded twins with stillbirth, congenital anomalies, and those delivered with cesarean section. We also controlled for confounding factors, including birth order, gestational age, maternal anthropometric measures, maternal smoking habits, and obstetric history. A subsample of this population was analyzed from Children and Women Hospital to obtain chorionicity information.\nMale-male twins were heavier than male-females and female-female twin pairs (p=.01). Within sex-discordant twin pairs, males were also heavier than females (p=.01). Regression analysis suggested that gender affects birth weight independent of birth order and gestational age. Other newborn anthropometric measures were not found to be dependent on gender. In analyzing a subsample with chorionicity data, birth weight was the only anthropometric measure that was both statistically and clinically affected by sex, even after adjustment for gestational age, chorionicity, birth order, and maternal age.\nBirth weight was affected by gender while head circumference and birth length were not.",

Regression analysis suggested that gender affects birth weight independent of birth order and gestational age. Other newborn anthropometric measures were not found to be dependent on gender. In analyzing a subsample with chorionicity data, birth weight was the only anthropometric measure that was both statistically and clinically affected by sex, even after adjustment for gestational age, chorionicity, birth order, and maternal age.",

    "abstract": "The interrelatedness between twin research and the arts is explored via a new play about a famous case. In the 1960s, identical twin David Bruce Reimer was accidentally castrated as an infant during circumcision to correct a urinary problem. The decision to raise him as a girl, and the consequences of that decision, are explored in the new theatrical production of Boy. Other examples of the arts mirroring science, and vice versa, are described. Next, brief reviews and summaries of twin research on sexual orientation, 1860s' knowledge of placental arrangements and twinning mechanisms, and genes underlying multiple birth conception and fertility related measures are provided. This article concludes with a look at twins on college campuses and the identification of individuals by their brain waves. A correction and clarification regarding my article on the Brazilian Twin Registry in the last issue of THG (Segal, 2016) is also provided.",

    "abstract": "Our aim was to test the direction of causation between self-report parental monitoring (PM) and the liability to illicit drug initiation (DI) as indicated by cannabis, cocaine, and stimulants. We fitted a multiple indicator model to test causal and non-causal models based on a large, genetically informative cross-sectional sample of male twins. The sample comprised 1,778 males aged 24-62 years from the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders. Data came from self-report measures of lifetime cannabis, stimulants, and cocaine initiation, and retrospective assessment of PM between ages 8-17 years. Multivariate modeling showed that familial aggregation in PM and DI were both explained by a combination of additive genetic and shared environmental effects. Moreover, the significant association between PM and DI was best explained by a correlated liability model versus causal models. PM has typically been assumed to be an environmental, causal risk factor for drug use and has been shown to be among the more salient environmental risk factors for illicit DI. Our data were not consistent with this causal hypothesis. Instead, a correlated liability model in which PM and risk of DI share common genetic and environmental risks provided a better fit to the data.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we assemble five large administrative data sets in Taiwan to investigate the short-run and long-run effects of birth weight. Comparing with previous studies, our results are more precisely estimated due to the large sample size. Using administrative data sets, the problems arising from self-reported samples are also mitigated. Moreover, we are able to examine both singletons by controlling sibling fixed effects and twins by controlling twin fixed effects. Our results show that an infant's birth weight has positive influence on health and education. Our twin fixed-effects estimates confirm the finding of a long-lasting, but diminishing in the longer run, effects of birth weight. Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "To investigate contributions of genetic and environmental risk factors and possible direction of causation for the relationship between symptoms of cannabis use disorders (CUD) and psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), a population-based sample of 2793 young adult twins (63.5% female, mean [range] age 28.2 [19-36] y) were assessed for symptoms of CUD and PLEs using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Latent risk of having symptoms of CUD or PLEs was modeled using Item Response Theory. Co-twin control analysis was performed to investigate effect of familiar confounding for the association between symptoms of CUD and PLEs. Biometric twin models were fitted to estimate the heritability, genetic and environmental correlations, and direction for the association. Lifetime use of cannabis was reported by 10.4 % of the twins, and prevalence of PLEs ranged from 0.1% to 2.2%. The incidence rate ratio of PLEs due to symptoms of CUD was 6.3 (95% CI, 3.9, 10.2) in the total sample and 3.5 (95% CI, 1.5, 8.2) within twin pairs. Heritability estimates for symptoms of CUD were 88% in men and women, and for PLEs 77% in men and 43% in women. The genetic and environmental correlations between symptoms of CUD and PLEs were 0.55 and 0.52, respectively. The model allowing symptoms of CUD to cause PLEs had a better fit than models specifying opposite or reciprocal directions of causation. The association between symptoms of CUD and PLEs is explained by shared genetic and environmental factors and direct effects from CUD to risk for PLEs.",

    "abstract": "There is a gap in knowledge regarding the cardiovascular system in fish conjoined twins, and regarding the cardiovascular morphogenesis of conjoined twins in general. We examined the cardiovascular system in a pair of fully developed ventrally conjoined salmonid twins (45.5\u00a0g body weight), and the arrangement of the blood vessels during early development in ventrally conjoined yolk sac larvae salmonid twins (<0.5\u00a0g body weight).\nIn the fully developed twins, one twin was normal, while the other was small and severely malformed. The mouth of the small twin was blocked, inhibiting respiration and feeding. Both twins had hearts, but these were connected through a common circulatory system. They were joined by the following blood vessels: (i) arteria iliaca running from arteria caudalis of the large twin to the kidney of the small twin; (ii) arteria subclavia running from aorta dorsalis of the large twin to aorta dorsalis of the small twin; (iii) vena hepatica running from the liver of the small twin into the sinus venosus of the large twin. Among the yolk sac larvae twins investigated, distinct vascular connections were found in some individuals through a joined v. vitellina hepatica.\nVentrally conjoined fish twins can develop cardiovascular connections during early development, enabling a normal superior twin to supply a malfunctioning twin with oxygen and nutrients. Since the yolk sac in salmonids is transparent, twinning in salmonids may be a useful model in which to study cardiovascular morphogenesis in conjoined twins.",

    "results": "In the fully developed twins, one twin was normal, while the other was small and severely malformed. The mouth of the small twin was blocked, inhibiting respiration and feeding. Both twins had hearts, but these were connected through a common circulatory system. They were joined by the following blood vessels: (i) arteria iliaca running from arteria caudalis of the large twin to the kidney of the small twin; (ii) arteria subclavia running from aorta dorsalis of the large twin to aorta dorsalis of the small twin; (iii) vena hepatica running from the liver of the small twin into the sinus venosus of the large twin. Among the yolk sac larvae twins investigated, distinct vascular connections were found in some individuals through a joined v. vitellina hepatica.",

    "abstract": "The brain continuously develops and reorganizes to support an expanding repertoire of behaviors and increasingly complex cognition. These processes may, however, also result in the appearance or disappearance of specific neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention problems. To investigate whether brain activity changed during adolescence, how genetics shape this change, and how these changes were related to attention problems, we measured EEG activity in 759 twins and siblings, assessed longitudinally in four waves (12, 14, 16, and 18years of age). Attention problems were assessed with the SWAN at waves 12, 14, and 16. To characterize functional brain development, we used a measure of temporal stability (TS) of brain oscillations over the recording time of 5min reflecting the tendency of a brain to maintain the same oscillatory state for longer or shorter periods. Increased TS may reflect the brain's tendency to maintain stability, achieve focused attention, and thus reduce \"mind wandering\" and attention problems. The results indicate that brain TS is increased across the scalp from 12 to 18. TS showed large individual differences that were heritable. Change in TS (alpha oscillations) was heritable between 12 and 14 and between 14 and 16 for the frontal brain areas. Absolute levels of brain TS at each wave were positively correlated with attention problems but not significantly. High and low attention problems subjects showed different developmental trajectories in TS, which was significant in a cluster of frontal leads. These results indicate that trajectories in brain TS development are a biomarker for the developing brain. TS in brain oscillations is highly heritable, and age-related change in TS is also heritable in selected brain areas. These results suggest that high and low attention problems subjects are at different stages of brain development.",

    "abstract": "Both genetic and environmental factors are known to affect body mass index (BMI), but detailed understanding of how their effects differ during childhood and adolescence is lacking.\nWe analyzed the genetic and environmental contributions to BMI variation from infancy to early adulthood and the ways they differ by sex and geographic regions representing high (North America and Australia), moderate (Europe), and low levels (East Asia) of obesogenic environments.\nData were available for 87,782 complete twin pairs from 0.5 to 19.5 y of age from 45 cohorts. Analyses were based on 383,092 BMI measurements. Variation in BMI was decomposed into genetic and environmental components through genetic structural equation modeling.\nThe variance of BMI increased from 5 y of age along with increasing mean BMI. The proportion of BMI variation explained by additive genetic factors was lowest at 4 y of age in boys (a(2) = 0.42) and girls (a(2) = 0.41) and then generally increased to 0.75 in both sexes at 19 y of age. This was because of a stronger influence of environmental factors shared by co-twins in midchildhood. After 15 y of age, the effect of shared environment was not observed. The sex-specific expression of genetic factors was seen in infancy but was most prominent at 13 y of age and older. The variance of BMI was highest in North America and Australia and lowest in East Asia, but the relative proportion of genetic variation to total variation remained roughly similar across different regions.\nEnvironmental factors shared by co-twins affect BMI in childhood, but little evidence for their contribution was found in late adolescence. Our results suggest that genetic factors play a major role in the variation of BMI in adolescence among populations of different ethnicities exposed to different environmental factors related to obesity.",

    "results": "The variance of BMI increased from 5 y of age along with increasing mean BMI. The proportion of BMI variation explained by additive genetic factors was lowest at 4 y of age in boys (a(2) = 0.42) and girls (a(2) = 0.41) and then generally increased to 0.75 in both sexes at 19 y of age. This was because of a stronger influence of environmental factors shared by co-twins in midchildhood. After 15 y of age, the effect of shared environment was not observed. The sex-specific expression of genetic factors was seen in infancy but was most prominent at 13 y of age and older. The variance of BMI was highest in North America and Australia and lowest in East Asia, but the relative proportion of genetic variation to total variation remained roughly similar across different regions.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the familial genetic characteristics of syncope in children.\nA detailed medical history was taken from four twin pairs of children complaining of dizziness, headache, chest tightness, chest pain, prodromal symptoms of syncope or syncope, meanwhile, these patients were given routine physical examination, 12-lead ECG, echocardiography, Holter ECG, EEG, MRI of the head and other tests to exclude cardio-cerebrovascular and pulmonary diseases, with those with unknown origin for syncope undergoing head-up tilt test (HUTT) and inquiry of detailed family history.\nThe four pairs of twins with syncope beginning at 7-12years and induced mostly by standing position (4/5), and positive family history was noted in two pairs. Vasovagal syncope (VVS)-vasoinhibitory response pattern was predominant in HUTT (4/5). The results and the response pattern in HUTT might diversify between two members within same twin pair: one appeared as vasoinhibitory response pattern and one postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) pattern in the first pair, one vasoinhibitory response pattern and one negative response pattern in the second pair, vasoinhibitory response pattern in the third pair and negative response pattern in the fourth pair.\nThe hereditary factors may play a more important role in younger children with syncope.

    "abstract": "Human life expectancy is influenced not only by longevity assurance mechanisms and disease susceptibility loci but also by the environment, gene-environment interactions, and chance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs closely related to genes. Circulating miRNAs have been shown as promising noninvasive biomarkers in the development of many pathophysiological conditions. However, the concentration of miRNA in the circulation may also be affected by environmental factors. We used a next-generation sequencing platform to assess the association of circulating miRNA with life expectancy, for which deaths are due to all causes independent of genes. In addition, we showed that miRNAs are present in 41-year archived plasma samples, which may be useful for both life expectancy and all-cause mortality risk assessment. Plasma miRNAs from nine identical male twins were profiled using next-generation sequencing. The average absolute difference in the minimum life expectancy was 9.68 years. Intraclass correlation coefficients were above 0.4 for 50% of miRNAs. Comparing deceased twins with their alive co-twin brothers, the concentrations were increased for 34 but decreased for 30 miRNAs. Identical twins discordant in life expectancy were dissimilar in the majority of miRNAs, suggesting that environmental factors are pivotal in miRNAs related to life expectancy.",

    "abstract": "By using historical data on about 50,000 twins born in Sweden during 1886-1958, we demonstrate a positive and statistically significant relationship between years of schooling and longevity. This relation remains almost unchanged when exploiting a twin fixed-effects design to control for the influence of genetics and shared family background. This result is robust to controlling for within-twin-pair differences in early-life health and cognitive ability, as proxied by birth weight and height, as well as to restricting the sample to MZ twins. The relationship is fairly constant over time but becomes weaker with age. Literally, our results suggest that compared with low levels of schooling (less than 10 years), high levels of schooling (at least 13 years of schooling) are associated with about three years longer life expectancy at age 60 for the considered birth cohorts. The real societal value of schooling may hence extend beyond pure labor market and economic growth returns. From a policy perspective, schooling may therefore be a vehicle for improving longevity and health, as well as equality along these dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia (HI/HA) syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by recurrent hypoglycemia and persistent mild elevation of plasma ammonia. HI/HA syndrome is one of the more common forms of congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), caused by activating mutations within the GLUD1 gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). We report here on monozygotic twin girls presented with fasting- and protein-induced hypoglycemia and mild persistent hyperammonemia. Genetic analysis revealed that both girls were heterozygous for a novel missense mutation within exon 11 [c.1499A>T, p.(R443W)] of the GLUD1 gene. Despite early treatment with diazoxide and a low protein diet, they both developed non-hypoglycemic seizures in early childhood followed by cognitive impairment. In addition to their clinical course, a review of the literature on HI/HA syndrome is provided.",

The case was a 28-year-old woman with the previous history of preclinical pregnancy and a miscarriage in two attempted in vitro fertilization cycles. Day 3 cleavage stage embryos were generated by conventional long protocol with the use of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog and a combination of recombinant folliculotropins and human menopausal gonadotropins. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection of oocytes thus obtained was performed, and 10 selected embryos underwent PGS using the array CGH technique. Two normal blastocysts were transferred to the patient, and she conceived twins. She delivered at 35 weeks of gestation by elective cesarean on November 19, 2014. She delivered a healthy male and female baby weighing 2.19 kg and 2.26 kg, respectively. Postnatal evaluation of babies was also normal, and the hospital course was uneventful. PGS has a definitive indication in assisted reproductive technology programs and can be utilized to improve pregnancy rates significantly.",

X-ray, bone densitometry, ultrasonography, pelvic MRI and measurement of pituitary, ovary, and thyroid hormones were performed. Both twins showed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, bilateral gonadal agenesis, fallopian tube, uterus, and vaginal hypoplasia but normal kidney and urinary tract structures and skeletal system. Analysis of Q-banded chromosomes in peripheral blood for the search for centromeric X-chromosome DNA and SRY gene was normal as well as the molecular analysis of FMR1, GDF9, and BMP15 genes. Estradiol gel was administered for one year followed by estroprogestin treatment. Both twins growth increased; breast development was stimulated and first menses occurred. Deregulation in the expression of the various HOX genes along the axis of the developing reproductive tract in a determinate time of development may be one of the mechanisms involved in the origin of this complex and rare association.",

    "abstract": "Measuring cortisol in hair is a promising method to assess long-term alterations of the biological stress response system, and hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) may be altered in psychiatric disorders and in subjects suffering from chronic stress. However, the pattern of associations between HCC, chronic stress and mental health require clarification. Our exploratory study: (1) assessed the association between HCC and perceived stress, symptoms of depression and neuroticism, and the trait extraversion (as a control variable); and (2) made use of the twin design to estimate the genetic and environmental covariance between the variables of interest. Hair samples from 109 (74 female) subjects (age range 12-21 years, mean 15.1) including 8 monozygotic (MZ) and 21 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs were analyzed. Perceived stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale and/or the Daily Life and Stressors Scale, neuroticism, and extraversion with the NEO-Five Factor Inventory or the Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and depressive symptoms with the Somatic and Psychological Health Report. We found a modest positive association between HCC and the three risk factors - perceived stress, symptoms of depression, and neuroticism (r = 0.22-0.33) - but no correlation with extraversion (-0.06). A median split revealed that the associations between HCC and risk factors were stronger (0.47-0.60) in those subjects with HCC >11.36 pg/mg. Furthermore, our results suggest that the genetic effects underlying HCC are largely shared with those that influence perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and neuroticism. These results of our proof of principle study warrant replication in a bigger sample but raise the interesting question of the direction of causation between these variables.",

    "abstract": "While trisomy 21 is a common genetic disorder in singletons, the incidence among identical twins is very rare, occurring in approximately 1-2 per 1000 twin gestations. Trisomy 21 is associated with high incidence of congenital heart defects, and commonly occurs with ventricular septal defects (VSDs). Physiologic burden of VSDs depends on prevalence of anatomic and other circulatory factors. A case of identical twins with trisomy 21 and large VSDs is described in the present report. Though genetically identical, phenotypes varied significantly. One twin was managed medically, while the other developed more significant heart failure, requiring operative repair.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twins are usually monozygotic and thus usually have the same sex. A case of monochorionic diamniotic twins following IVF/ICSI and laser treatment of the zona pellucida (\"assisted hatching\") is presented in which partial embryo amalgamation appears to have occurred. Discordant sex between the twins was suspected on detailed antenatal ultrasound at 13\u2009+\u20093 weeks gestation and was confirmed on subsequent examinations. The sexual phenotype at birth was female for one twin and male for the other. Placental histology confirmed the monochorionic, diamniotic situation. Cytogenetic analysis of both twins was carried out postpartum on various tissues. On karyotyping of blood lymphocytes the male and female twins each had one mosaic of male and female cells. Oral mucosal cells showed normal male and female karyotypes respectively. Analysis of urothelium showed a normal result for the male infant, and a weak gonosomal mosaic with an XX and XY constellation for the female infant. At least for blood lymphocytes, a diagnosis of chimerism was proven.\n\u00dcblicherweise sind monochoriale Zwillingsschwangerschaften monozygot und weisen dasselbe Geschlecht auf. Im vorliegenden Fall war nach IVF/ICSI und Laserbehandlung der Zona pellucida (\u201eassisted hatching\u201c) eine monochoriale, diamniote Geminigravidit\u00e4t eingetreten, bei der es wohl zu einer partiellen Verschmelzung der Embryonen kam. Pr\u00e4natal wurde in der 13\u2009+\u20093\u2009SSW im Rahmen einer detaillierten Ultraschalldiagnostik der Verdacht auf eine Diskrepanz der Geschlechter der Gemini gestellt, der sich in den Folgeuntersuchungen best\u00e4tigte. Post partum war das ph\u00e4notypische Geschlecht des einen Zwillings weiblich und des anderen m\u00e4nnlich. Die Histologie der Plazenta best\u00e4tigte die monochorialen, diamnioten Eihautverh\u00e4ltnisse. Postnatal erfolgte die zytogenetische Analyse der Zwillinge in verschiedenen Geweben. Die Karyotypisierung an Blutlymphozyten ergab f\u00fcr den weiblichen und m\u00e4nnlichen Zwilling jeweils ein Mosaik aus m\u00e4nnlichen und weiblichen Zellen. In den Mundschleimhautzellen zeigte sich f\u00fcr beide Neugeborene ein unauff\u00e4lliger m\u00e4nnlicher bzw. weiblicher Karyotyp. Die Diagnostik an Urothelzellen war f\u00fcr das m\u00e4nnliche Neugeborene ebenfalls unauff\u00e4llig und zeigte f\u00fcr das weibliche Neugeborene ein schwaches gonosomales Mosaik mit XX- und XY-Konstellation. Zumindest f\u00fcr Blutlymphozyten konnte die Diagnose der Chim\u00e4ren bewiesen werden.",

    "abstract": "Although familial aggregation of lymphoproliferative disorders has been described, heredity has not been implicated in the etiology of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (PCBCL). We report herein the first case of 2 young monozygotic twins with PCBCL. The first twin was an 18-year-old woman when she presented with multiple skin nodules on the thorax and head. Histology showed an atypical small B-cell proliferation, consistent with primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL). Molecular genetics studies demonstrated B-cell clonality. Seven years later, the second twin developed her first lesion that was histologically similar to that of her twin. She subsequently developed other clinically similar lesions. Histology was consistent with PCMZL and showed B-cell clonality. Occurrence of PCBCL in these monozygotic twins raises the possibility of a genetic risk factor. Further study of such rare cases may offer valuable insights into the molecular basis of the etiology and pathogenesis of this unusual disorder.",

    "abstract": "Using dietary biomarkers in nutritional epidemiological studies may better capture exposure and improve the level at which diet-disease associations can be established and explored. Here, we aimed to identify and evaluate reproducibility of novel biomarkers of reported habitual food intake using targeted and non-targeted metabolomic blood profiling in a large twin cohort. Reported intakes of 71 food groups, determined by FFQ, were assessed against 601 fasting blood metabolites in over 3500 adult female twins from the TwinsUK cohort. For each metabolite, linear regression analysis was undertaken in the discovery group (excluding MZ twin pairs discordant [\u22651 SD apart] for food group intake) with each food group as a predictor adjusting for age, batch effects, BMI, family relatedness and multiple testing (1.17x10-6 = 0.05/[71 food groups x 601 detected metabolites]). Significant results were then replicated (non-targeted: P<0.05; targeted: same direction) in the MZ discordant twin group and results from both analyses meta-analyzed. We identified and replicated 180 significant associations with 39 food groups (P<1.17x10-6), overall consisting of 106 different metabolites (74 known and 32 unknown), including 73 novel associations. In particular we identified trans-4-hydroxyproline as a potential marker of red meat intake (0.075[0.009]; P = 1.08x10-17), ergothioneine as a marker of mushroom consumption (0.181[0.019]; P = 5.93x10-22), and three potential markers of fruit consumption (top association: apple and pears): including metabolites derived from gut bacterial transformation of phenolic compounds, 3-phenylpropionate (0.024[0.004]; P = 1.24x10-8) and indolepropionate (0.026[0.004]; P = 2.39x10-9), and threitol (0.033[0.003]; P = 1.69x10-21). With the largest nutritional metabolomics dataset to date, we have identified 73 novel candidate biomarkers of food intake for potential use in nutritional epidemiological studies. We compiled our findings into the DietMetab database (http://www.twinsuk.ac.uk/dietmetab-data/), an online tool to investigate our top associations.",

    "abstract": "Cystatin C is associated with both renal function and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). We have previously shown a genetic correlation between cystatin C and prevalent ASCVD. The objective of this article is to study whether variation in cystatin C or creatinine predicts incident ASCVD when controlled for genetic factors.\nThe predictive value of cystatin C and creatinine for incident ASCVD was studied in 11\u00a0402 Swedish twins, free of CVD at baseline, in an adjusted Cox-regression model during a median follow-up of 71\u00a0months. Twin pairs discordant for incident stroke, myocardial infarction and ASCVD during follow-up were identified and within-pair comparisons regarding cystatin C and creatinine levels were performed. We also investigated whether contact frequency and degree of shared environment influences were associated with similarity in cystatin C levels. In univariate analysis, cystatin C predicted incident ASCVD hazard ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.47-1.67. When adjusted for traditional Framingham risk factors as covariates, cystatin C remained a predictor of incident stroke hazard ratio 1.45, 95% CI (1.25-1.70), ASCVD hazard ratio 1.26, 95% CI (1.13-1.41), and myocardial infarction hazard ratio 1.16, 95% CI (1.01-1.33). In twins discordant for incident stroke, cystatin C at baseline was higher in the twin who experienced a stroke compared to the healthy co-twin (1.11\u00b10.3\u00a0mg/L versus 1.06\u00b10.3\u00a0mg/L), whereas creatinine was lower in the twin who developed CVD compared to their healthy co-twins (76.1\u00b116.9\u00a0\u03bcmol/L versus 79.4\u00b120.3\u00a0\u03bcmol/L).\nVariation in cystatin C relates to incident ASCVD and to stroke when adjusted for genetic confounding. In identical twins, cystatin C may be a sensitive marker of early hypertensive end-organ damage and small-vessel disease, whereas creatinine level may reflect nutritional status. The findings in disease-discordant monozygotic twins indicate that unique, possibly preventable, environmental factors are important.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol intake may be associated with cancer risk, but epidemiologic evidence for prostate cancer is inconsistent. We aimed to prospectively investigate the association between midlife alcohol intake and drinking patterns with future prostate cancer risk and mortality in a population-based cohort of Finnish twins.\nData were drawn from the Older Finnish Twin Cohort and included 11,372 twins followed from 1981 to 2012. Alcohol consumption was assessed by questionnaires administered at two time points over follow-up. Over the study period, 601 incident cases of prostate cancer and 110 deaths from prostate cancer occurred. Cox regression was used to evaluate associations between weekly alcohol intake and binge drinking patterns with prostate cancer risk and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Within-pair co-twin analyses were performed to control for potential confounding by shared genetic and early environmental factors.\nCompared to light drinkers (\u22643 drinks/week; non-abstainers), heavy drinkers (>14 drinks/week) were at a 1.46-fold higher risk (HR 1.46; 95\u00a0% CI 1.12, 1.91) of prostate cancer, adjusting for important confounders. Among current drinkers, binge drinkers were at a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer (HR 1.28; 95\u00a0% CI 1.06, 1.55) compared to non-binge drinkers. Abstainers were at a 1.90-fold higher risk (HR 1.90; 95\u00a0% CI 1.04, 3.47) of prostate cancer-specific mortality compared to light drinkers, but no other significant associations for mortality were found. Co-twin analyses suggested that alcohol consumption may be associated with prostate cancer risk independent of early environmental and genetic factors.\nHeavy regular alcohol consumption and binge drinking patterns may be associated with increased prostate cancer risk, while abstinence may be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality compared to light alcohol consumption.",

    "abstract": "The mutations in the dual oxidase maturation factor 2 (DUOXA2) and dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2) genes have been identified in patients with congenital hypothyroidism (CH). This study reports a set of dizygotic twins with CH due to the mutations in the DUOX2/DUOXA2 system.\nThe dizygotic twins, a boy and a girl, both aged 7 years, were born to euthyroid nonconsanguineous parents; they were diagnosed with CH at neonatal screening and were enrolled in this study. The DUOXA2, DUOX2, paired box 8 (PAX8), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) genes were considered for mutation screening. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, and Sanger sequencing was used to screen for the mutations in the exon fragments. Family members of the patients were also enrolled and evaluated.\nThe fraternal twins each harbored a single heterozygous mutation, including c.738C>G (p.Y246X) in the boy inherited from the paternal DUOXA2 allele and c.2654G>A (p.R885Q) in the girl from the maternal DUOX2 allele. The two mutations have been previously reported. The boy showed enlarged thyroid lobes and a little calcification in the left lobe, while the girl's thyroid gland was severely underdeveloped and the girl had obvious complications due to irregular treatment. The germline mutations from this family were consistent with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. No mutations in the PAX8, TPO, and TSHR genes were detected in this study.\nThe inactivating mutations in the DUOXA2 (p.Y246X) and DUOX2 (p.R885Q) genes were identified in a set of dizygotic twins with CH. The girl was more severe in several aspects than her brother. The similar genetic defect resulted in very different outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Attempted separation of craniopagus twins has continued to be associated with devastating results since the first partially successful separation with one surviving twin in 1952. To understand the factors that contribute to successful separation in the modern era of neuroimaging and modern surgical techniques, the authors reviewed and analyzed cases reported since 1995.\nAll reported cases of craniopagus twin separation attempts from 1995 to 2015 were identified using PubMed (n = 19). In addition, the Internet was searched for additional unreported separation attempts (n = 5). The peer-reviewed cases were used to build a categorical database containing information on each twin pair, including sex; date of birth; date of surgery; multiple- versus single-stage surgery; angular versus vertical conjoining; nature of shared cerebral venous system; and the presence of other comorbidities identified as cardiovascular, genitourinary, and craniofacial. The data were analyzed to find factors associated with successful separation (survival of both twins at postoperative day 30).\nVertical craniopagus is associated with successful separation (p < 0.001). No statistical significance was attributed to the nature of the shared cerebral venous drainage or the other variables examined. Multiple-stage operations and surgery before 12 months of age are associated with a trend toward statistical significance for successful separation.\nThe authors' analysis indicates that vertical craniopagus twins have the highest likelihood of successful separation. Additional factors possibly associated with successful separation include the nature of the shared sinus system, surgery at a young age, and the use of staged separations.\nTherapeutic, V.",

    "abstract": "Although monozygotic (MZ) twins have theoretically identical nuclear DNA sequences, there may be phenotypic differences between them caused by somatic mutations and epigenetic changes affecting each genome. In this study, we collected eight families of MZ twins discordant for schizophrenia with the aim of investigating the potential role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy in causing the phenotypic differences between the twin pairs. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was used to screen the whole mitochondrial genome of the twin pairs and their parents. The mtDNA heteroplasmy level was found to be nearly identical between the twin pairs but was distinctly different between each mother and their offspring. These results suggest that the discordance of schizophrenia between MZ twins may not be attributable to the difference in mtDNA heteroplasmy, and the high concordance of mtDNA heteroplasmy between MZ twins may indicate the relatively equal distribution of mtDNA during embryo separation of MZ twins and/or the modulation effect from the same nuclear genetic background. Furthermore, we observed an overrepresentation of heteroplasmy in noncoding regions and an elevated ratio of nonsynonymous heteroplasmy, suggesting the possible effects of a purifying selection in shaping the pattern of mtDNA heteroplasmy.",

    "abstract": "Overlapping genetic influences have been implicated in diurnal preference and subjective sleep quality. Our overall aim was to examine overlapping concurrent and longitudinal genetic and environmental effects on diurnal preference and sleep quality over ~5 years. Behavioral genetic analyses were performed on data from the longitudinal British G1219 study of young adult twins and nontwin siblings. A total of 1556 twins and siblings provided data on diurnal preference (Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire) and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) at time 1 (mean age = 20.30 years, SD = 1.76; 62% female), and 862 participated at time 2 (mean age = 25.30 years, SD = 1.81; 66% female). Preference for eveningness was associated with poorer sleep quality at both time points (r = 0.25 [95% confidence intervals {CIs} = 0.20-0.30] and r = 0.21 [CI = 0.15-0.28]). There was substantial overlap in the genetic influences on diurnal preference and sleep quality individually, across time (genetic correlations [rAs]: 0.64 [95% CI = 0.59-0.67] and 0.48 [95% CI = 0.42-.053]). There were moderate genetic correlations between diurnal preference and sleep quality concurrently and longitudinally (rAs = 0.29-0.60). Nonshared environmental overlap was substantially smaller for all cross-phenotype associations (nonshared environmental correlations (rEs) = -0.02 to 0.08). All concurrent and longitudinal associations within and between phenotypes were largely accounted for by genetic factors (explaining between 60% and 100% of the associations). All shared environmental effects were nonsignificant. Nonshared environmental influences played a smaller role on the associations between phenotypes (explaining between -0.06% and 40% of the associations). These results suggest that to some extent, similar genes contribute to the stability of diurnal preference and sleep quality throughout young adulthood but also that different genes play a part over this relatively short time frame. While there was evidence of genetic overlap between phenotypes concurrently and longitudinally, the possible emergence of new genetic factors (or decline of previously associated factors) suggests that molecular genetic studies focusing on young adults should consider more tightly specified age groups, given that genetic effects may be time specific.",

    "abstract": "The feeding behavior in humans is complex, with psychological, social, and cultural factors. This pathology consists of the desire to eat (reinforcement/reward) and the control of the act of eating (inhibitory control). It is well known that blocking post-synaptic D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens induces a decrease of craving behavior. Due to this, to test hypothesis we measured the expression of the DRD2 gene and the expression of the type of feeding factor in a group of Mexican twins.\nIn the study were included 18 pairs of twins (n = 36), reared together (at least up to 18 years old); native to Mexico City; to whom we applied the three factors of food instrument.\nWe observed a significant correlation between the \"uncontrolled\" factor and expression of the DRD2 gene (p < 0.03).\nTherefore, we propose that the expression of the DRD2 gene in subjects is a linkage to the type of feeding factor.",

    "abstract": "Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), which refers to reduced fetal growth in the context of placental insufficiency, is etiologically heterogeneous. IUGR is associated not only with perinatal morbidity and mortality but also with adult-onset disorders, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, posing a major health burden. Placental epigenetic dysregulation has been proposed as one mechanism that causes IUGR; however, the spectrum of epigenetic pathophysiological mechanisms leading to IUGR remains to be elucidated. Monozygotic monochorionic twins are particularly affected by IUGR, in the setting of severe discordant growth. Because monozygotic twins have the same genotype at conception and a shared maternal environment, they provide an ideal model system for studying epigenetic dysregulation of the placenta.\nWe compared genome-wide placental DNA methylation patterns of severely growth-discordant twins to identify novel candidate genes for IUGR. Snap-frozen placental samples for eight severely growth-discordant monozygotic monochorionic twin pairs were obtained at delivery from each twin. A high-resolution DNA methylation array platform was used to identify methylation differences between IUGR and normal twins. Our analysis revealed differentially methylated regions in the promoters of eight genes: DECR1, ZNF300, DNAJA4, CCL28, LEPR, HSPA1A/L, GSTO1, and GNE. The largest methylation differences between the two groups were in the promoters of DECR1 and ZNF300. The significance of these group differences was independently validated by bisulfite pyrosequencing, implicating aberrations in fatty acid beta oxidation and transcriptional regulation, respectively. Further analysis of the array data identified methylation changes most prominently affecting the Wnt and cadherin pathways in the IUGR cohort.\nOur results suggest that IUGR in monozygotic twins is associated with impairments in lipid metabolism and transcriptional regulation as well as cadherin and Wnt signaling. We show that monozygotic monochorionic twins discordant for growth provide a useful model to study one type of the epigenetic placental dysregulation that drives IUGR.",

    "results": "We compared genome-wide placental DNA methylation patterns of severely growth-discordant twins to identify novel candidate genes for IUGR. Snap-frozen placental samples for eight severely growth-discordant monozygotic monochorionic twin pairs were obtained at delivery from each twin. A high-resolution DNA methylation array platform was used to identify methylation differences between IUGR and normal twins. Our analysis revealed differentially methylated regions in the promoters of eight genes: DECR1, ZNF300, DNAJA4, CCL28, LEPR, HSPA1A/L, GSTO1, and GNE. The largest methylation differences between the two groups were in the promoters of DECR1 and ZNF300. The significance of these group differences was independently validated by bisulfite pyrosequencing, implicating aberrations in fatty acid beta oxidation and transcriptional regulation, respectively. Further analysis of the array data identified methylation changes most prominently affecting the Wnt and cadherin pathways in the IUGR cohort.",

    "abstract": "The regulatory factors explaining the wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes for mitochondrial 3243A>G mutation are not known. Crosstalk between nuclear genes and mitochondrial DNA might be one factor.\nIn this case series, we compared 2 pairs of male twins with the mitochondrial 3243 A>G mutation and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome with a female control patient. One pair of monozygotic twins presented with diabetes and deafness in their 30s, stroke-like episodes in their 40s, and cardiac events and death in their 50s. Another pair of twins presented with deafness and stroke-like episodes in their 20s. The degree of heteroplasmy of 3243A>G mutation in the various tissues and organs was similar in the first pair of twins compared with the control patient.\nThe clinical phenotype and segregation of mitochondrial 3243A>G mutation was similar in monozygotic twins. The onset age and distribution of the symptoms might be regulated by nuclear genes. Our findings might help to predict the clinical course of the surviving twins and afford an opportunity for therapy before the onset of mitochondrial disease, especially for monozygotic twins caused by nuclear transfer with a small amount of nuclear-donor mitochondrial DNA.",

    "abstract": "A dramatic increase in twin pregnancies has been observed in the past few decades, primarily related to assisted reproductive techniques (ART) and increased average maternal age during pregnancy. Multiple pregnancies, compared to singleton pregnancies, are associated with greater perinatal morbidity and mortality. The present study evaluated the perinatal outcomes of pregnancies with discordant anomalous twins in a tertiary maternity ward in a developing country. Data were retrospectively collected from the Instituto Fernandes Figueira/FIOCRUZ, Brazil between January 2002 and December 2014. We identified 74 twin pregnancies with discordant anomalous twins. Final data analysis was based on 40 pregnancies. Congenital defects were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases: ICD-10: the digestive system was responsible in 27 (34%) cases; the central nervous system was responsible in 18 (22%) cases; the urinary tract was responsible in 14 (17%) cases; and the circulatory system was responsible in 14 (17%) cases. A total of 19 deaths occurred during the study period, and delivery before 30.4 weeks was a significant prediction of fetal death (p = .01). The presence of hydrops in the affected fetus was related to a higher number of deaths in healthy fetuses and contributed to a worse prognosis. The presence of this condition was the cause of 12 (55.6%) deaths in healthy fetuses. A 10 times higher risk of death of a normal co-twin was observed in cases of death of the anomalous twin (p = .002, OR 10.55, 95% CI: 1.9-58.52).",

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether discrepant copy number variations (CNVs) contribute to the risk for discordant congenital anomalies in monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins.\nWe conducted a parallel testing using both G-banding for standard karyotyping and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) with Affymetrix CytoScan HD array in MCDA twins with discordant malformations.\nDuring the study period, 193 MCDA twins with discordant malformations were detected and followed up. Multiple anomalies and cardiac defects were detected most frequently among the fetuses with malformations. Among all the 119 MCDA twins that were successfully performed fetal karyotyping, discordance of chromosomal aberrations were identified in nine cases, including one with discordant trisomy 18, seven with discordant monosomy X, one twin with 47, XXY and the co-twin with 45, X [7]/46, XY[43]. CMA revealed pathological CNVs in four out of the 110 fetuses with normal karyotype and the detection rate of uncertain clinical significance was 3.6% (4/110). Discordance of CNVs was detected in 5.5% (3/55) among the 55 MCDA twins with normal karyotype. Monozygosity was confirmed in all the 61 MCDA twins that were performed CMA.\nLarge whole chromosome abnormalities are more common between discordant twins rather than smaller CNVs in this study. \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Peripheral blood T and B cells obtained from a human leucocyte D4-related (antigen DR4(-) HLA-DR4)(+) woman with early RA, her healthy monozygotic twin and an unrelated HLA-DR3(+) woman with early RA were analysed for activation (CD154/CD69), apoptosis (annexin/7-aminoactinomycin), cytokine production [interferon (IFN)\u03b3/interleukin (IL)-17/IL-4/IL-10/IL-6] and functional phenotype (CD45Ra/CCR7) after stimulation with the collagen native T cell epitope (T261-273), the K264 carbamylated T cell epitope (carT261-273), the native B cell epitope (B359-369) or the R360 citrullinated B cell epitope (citB359-369), and the combinations of these. The T cell memory compartment was activated by T cell epitopes in both discordant DR4(+) twins, but not in the DR3(+) RA. The collagen-specific activation of CD4(+) T cells was induced with both the native and carbamylated T cell epitopes only in the RA twin. Both T cell epitopes also induced IL-17 production in the RA twin, but a greater IL-4 and IL-10 response in the healthy twin. The\u00a0citrullinated B cell epitope, particularly when combined with the carbamylated T cell epitope, induced B cell activation and an increased IL-6/IL-10 ratio in the RA twin compared to a greater IL-10 production in the healthy twin. Our data suggest that circulating collagen-specific T and B cells are found in HLA-DR4(+) subjects, but only RA activated cells express co-stimulatory molecules and produce proinflammatory cytokines. Carbamylation and citrullination further modulate the activation and cytokine polarization of T and B cells.",

    "abstract": "IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common form of primary GN and an important cause of kidney failure. Characteristically, patients with IgAN have increased serum levels of undergalactosylated IgA1 (gd-IgA1). To assess the degree to which serum gd-IgA1 levels are genetically determined in healthy individuals, we determined serum IgA and gd-IgA1 levels by ELISA in a sample of 148 healthy female twins, including 27 monozygotic and 47 dizygotic pairs. Using the classic twin model, we found the heritability of serum gd-IgA1 and IgA levels to be 80% (95% confidence interval, 66% to 89%) and 46% (95% confidence interval, 15% to 69%), respectively. These data indicate that serum gd-IgA1 levels are highly heritable. Elucidating the genetic basis of this heritability will be important in understanding the pathogenesis of IgAN.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to analyze the perinatal outcome of twin gestations and estimate the influence of chorionicity on the outcome in a large cohort of twin pregnancies in Poland.\nA retrospective analysis of 465 twin deliveries in 6 Polish centers in 2012 was conducted. Baseline characteristics, the course of pregnancy and labor, as well as the neonatal outcome were analyzed in the study group and according to chorionicity.\nA total of 356 twin pregnancies were dichorionic (DC group) (76.6%), and 109 were monochorionic (MC group) (23.4%). There were no differences in the occurrence of pregnancy complications according to chorionicity, except for IUGR of at least one fetus (MC 43.1% vs. DC 34.6%; p = 0.003). 66.5% of the women delivered preterm, significantly more in the MC group (78% vs. 62.9%; p = 0.004). Cesarean delivery was performed in 432 patients (92.9%). Mean neonatal birthweight was statistically lower in the MC group (2074 g vs. 2370 g; p < 0.001). Perinatal mortality of at least one twin was 4.3% (2.8% in the DC group vs. 9.2% in the MC group; p = 0.004). Neonatal complications, including NICU admission, respiratory disorders, and infections requiring antibiotic therapy, were significantly more often observed among the MC twins.\nThe overall perinatal outcome in the presented subpopulation of Polish twins and its dependence on cho-rionicity is similar to the reports in the literature. Nevertheless, the rates of preterm and cesarean deliveries remain higher. It seems that proper counselling of pregnant women and education of obstetricians may result in reduction of these rates.",

    "abstract": "Twins can help researchers disentangle the roles of genes from those of the environment on human traits, health, and diseases. To realize this potential, the Australian Twin Registry (ATR), University of Melbourne, and the Charles Perkins Centre (CPC), University of Sydney, established a collaboration to form the Twins Research Node, a highly interconnected research facility dedicated specifically to research involving twins. This collaboration aims to foster the adoption of twin designs as important tools for research in a range of health-related domains. The CPC hosted their Twins Research Node's launch seminar entitled 'Double the power of your research with twin studies', in which experienced twin researchers described how twin studies are supporting scientific discoveries and careers. The launch also featured twin pairs who have actively participated in research through the ATR. Researchers at the CPC were surveyed before the event to gauge their level of understanding and interest in utilizing twin research. This article describes the new Twins Research Node, discusses the survey's main results and reports on the launch seminar.",

    "abstract": "As patents expire on innovator products, there is increasing interest in developing biosimilar products globally. Biosimilars are not exact copies and are not considered generic versions of the reference product. They may differ in strength, purity and contain different composition of isoforms and/or various glycosylation profiles, with the consequent alterations in clinical efficacy or safety. Recently 2 new recombinant FSH preparations were introduced to clinical practice following randomized controlled, phase 3 clinical trials. Both, Bemfola and Ovaleap\u00ae were referred to the FSH innovator product Gonal-f\u2122 (Follitropin alpha), and were found to yield an equivalent number of oocytes (primary end-point), following a long GnRH agonist suppressive protocol in \"ideal\" patients, i.e., young, normal responders. However, a closer look at these RCTs reveals a non-significant 4\u00a0% difference in clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates, in favor of Gonal f over the biosimilar products, accompanied by half the incidence of OHSS (2.9 vs 5.2\u00a0%, respectively). These studies were underpowered with reference to pregnancy rates, Thus, we believe that further comparative studies are needed in additional patient populations, e.g.,older,, poor responders, patients with repeated IVF failures and/or polycystic ovary syndrome, before the universal implementation of biosimilar products for clinical use. Biosimilars are actually a regulatory synonym, facilitating a fast track introduction of a FSH preparation to the COH armamentarium. We therefore recommend against interchanging or substituting innovator and biosimilar agents in clinical practice, and believe that the decision whether to use an innovator or a biosimilar product, should be reserved to the discretion of the treating physician. Furthermore, we believe the time has come that the measurement of the biological activity of FSH in humans should require other methods rather than the Steelman-Pohley assay, such as the determination of dose-response curves in defined populations of women with well-defined outcomes during COH in preparation for ART.",

    "abstract": "Although monozygotic (MZ) twins share the majority of their genetic makeup, they can be phenotypically discordant on several traits and diseases. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that can be influenced by genetic, environmental and stochastic events and may have an important impact on individual variability. In this study we explored epigenetic differences in peripheral blood samples in three MZ twin studies on major depressive disorder (MDD). Epigenetic data for twin pairs were collected as part of a previous study using 8.1-K-CpG microarrays tagging DNA modification in white blood cells from MZ twins discordant for MDD. Data originated from three geographical regions: UK, Australia and the Netherlands. Ninety-seven MZ pairs (194 individuals) discordant for MDD were included. Different methods to address non independently-and-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data were evaluated. Machine-learning methods with feature selection centered on support vector machine and random forest were used to build a classifier to predict cases and controls based on epivariations. The most informative variants were mapped to genes and carried forward for network analysis. A mixture approach using principal component analysis (PCA) and Bayes methods allowed to combine the three studies and to leverage the increased predictive power provided by the larger sample. A machine-learning algorithm with feature reduction classified affected from non-affected twins above chance levels in an independent training-testing design. Network analysis revealed gene networks centered on the PPAR-\u03b3 (NR1C3) and C-MYC gene hubs interacting through the AP-1 (c-Jun) transcription factor. PPAR-\u03b3 (NR1C3) is a drug target for pioglitazone, which has been shown to reduce depression symptoms in patients with MDD. Using a data-driven approach we were able to overcome challenges of non-i.i.d. data when combining epigenetic studies from MZ twins discordant for MDD. Individually, the studies yielded negative results but when combined classification of the disease state from blood epigenome alone was possible. Network analysis revealed genes and gene networks that support the inflammation hypothesis of MDD.",

The common presenting features would be progressive stiffness of multiple joints, skin lesions, multiple episodes of protracted infections, prolonged diarrhoea and failure to thrive. ISH is a rapidly progressive painful disorder of infancy with a very short life expectancy.\n3 months old identical twins born to a 5th degree consanguinous couple were brought with complaints of excessive cry, deformity of all four limbs, recurrent episodes of respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea since birth. Evaluation of both the probands revealed facial dysmorphism with perinasal nodules, gingival hypertrophy, fixed deformities of multiple joints bilaterally, umbilical hernia, fleshy perianal nodules and pigmented patches over knuckles and ankle. A clinical diagnosis of ISH was suspected and confirmed by detection of homozygous c.277_278insATTATTT (or p.L93Yfs*14) in exon 3 of the ANTXR2 gene. The probands were managed symptomatically and parents were counselled regarding prenatal diagnosis in future pregnancies.\nIHS is commonly misdiagnosed as Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita and is often mismanaged with manipulation of the stiff joints and invasive surgical procedures. Prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus biopsy is possible once causative mutation in a family is identified. Invasive surgical interventions for histopathological analysis can be avoided as clinical features are most often classical and genetic analysis is confirmatory. Management is conservative and symptomatic. We report this case of identical twins with features of ISH in view of its rarity as timely clinical suspicion can avoid painful and invasive procedures for diagnosis and management.",

    "abstract": "Smaller observational studies have suggested familial clustering of mitral regurgitation (MR). Using a large twin cohort, the aims were to assess MR concordance rates and assess mortality in MR twins and unaffected cotwins.\nThrough the Danish Twin Registry, twins with an International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision and Tenth Revision diagnosis code of MR born 1880-1989 were identified and proband-wise concordance rates were calculated. To assess whether having a cotwin with MR affected survival, 10 matched twins without MR (n = 5,575) were selected for each MR twin (n = 562), and all-cause mortality rates were assessed.\nAmong the 87,432 twins alive January 1, 1977, or later, 494 (0.57%) MR individuals were identified. Six MR concordant pairs were found, of which 3 were monozygotic. Proband-wise concordance rate when accounting for right censoring and competing risk of death was 0.12 (95% CI 0.04-0.32) for monozygotic twins and 0.03 (95% CI 0.01-0.09) for dizygotic twins. Mortality was significantly higher among the affected twins with MR within discordant twin pairs where both were alive at the date of MR diagnosis (sex-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.57, 95% CI 1.86-3.54). Overall there was no increased mortality risk for unaffected cotwins to MR cases compared with matched controls (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90-1.17) except for first year of life (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.10-3.36) and for monozygotic twins older than 65 years (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.07-2.08).\nAlthough there is a familial aggregation of MR, the absolute risk is low, even for monozygotic cotwins to affected twins. The study found increased mortality in MR twins compared with their unaffected cotwins. Overall no excess mortality was observed in the unaffected cotwins except for first year of life and for monozygotic cotwins older than 65 years.",

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin A (IgA), the major class of antibody secreted by the gut mucosa, is an important contributor to gut barrier function. The repertoire of IgA bound to gut bacteria reflects both T-cell-dependent and -independent pathways, plus glycans present on the antibody's secretory component. Human gut bacterial taxa targeted by IgA in the setting of barrier dysfunction are capable of producing intestinal pathology when isolated and transferred to gnotobiotic mice. A complex reorientation of gut immunity occurs as infants transition from passively acquired IgA present in breast milk to host-derived IgA. How IgA responses co-develop with assembly of the microbiota during this period remains poorly understood. Here, we (1) identify a set of age-discriminatory bacterial taxa whose representations define a program of microbiota assembly and maturation during the first 2 postnatal years that is shared across 40 healthy twin pairs in the USA; (2) describe a pattern of progression of gut mucosal IgA responses to bacterial members of the microbiota that is highly distinctive for family members (twin pairs) during the first several postnatal months then generalizes across pairs in the second year; and (3) assess the effects of zygosity, birth mode, and breast feeding. Age-associated differences in these IgA responses can be recapitulated in young germ-free mice, colonized with faecal microbiota obtained from two twin pairs at 6 and 18 months of age, and fed a sequence of human diets that simulate the transition from milk feeding to complementary foods. Most of these responses were robust to diet, suggesting that 'intrinsic' properties of community members play a dominant role in dictating IgA responses. The approach described can be used to define gut mucosal immune development in health and disease states and to help discover ways of repairing or preventing perturbations in this facet of host immunity.",

    "abstract": "Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation is associated with chronic pain. Studying pain sensitivity and the HPA axis could elucidate the role of stress in chronic pain development, which might be influenced by familial factors, including genes.\nAssociations between pain sensitivity and salivary cortisol and familial confounding in these associations were examined in 88 female, community-based twin pairs (75% monozygotic, mean age 29 y). Cortisol was assessed after 0.25 mg dexamethasone (DEX), recovery from 0.25 mg DEX, and after 0.5 mg DEX. Cold pressor task (CPT) pain ratings were obtained at threshold and at tolerance. Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) was examined using thermal heat as the testing stimulus and hot water as the conditioning stimulus. Generalized estimating equation models were used and adjusted for baseline pain rating, age, and other relevant covariates.\nAfter controlling for baseline cortisol, greater cortisol suppression following DEX administration and lower recovery cortisol levels were associated with higher pain ratings at tolerance during the CPT (Bs=-2.42 to -17.82; Ps=0.031 to<0.001) as well as with reduced CPM (Bs=-0.92 to -1.68; Ps=0.003 to 0.046). Interestingly, familial confounding was evident in the CPT and CPM during recovery from DEX administration, but not immediately following DEX administration.\nThese findings contribute to understanding possible mechanisms underlying chronic pain by demonstrating that HPA axis response to negative feedback is related to pain sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "To describe the establishment of a Danish inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) twin cohort with focus on concordance of treatment and inflammatory markers.\nWe identified MZ twins, likely to be discordant or concordant for IBD, by merging information from the Danish Twin Register and the National Patient Register. The twins were asked to provide biological samples, questionnaires, and data access to patient files and public registries. Biological samples were collected via a mobile laboratory, which allowed for immediate centrifugation, fractionation, and storage of samples. The mean time from collection of samples to storage in the -80\u2005\u00b0C mobile freezer was less than one hour. The diagnoses where validated using the Copenhagen diagnostic criteria.\nWe identified 159 MZ IBD twin pairs, in a total of 62 (39%) pairs both twins agreed to participate. Of the supposed 62 IBD pairs, the IBD diagnosis could be confirmed in 54 pairs. The cohort included 10 concordant pairs, whereof some were discordant for either treatment or surgery. The 10 concordant pairs, where both pairs suffered from IBD, included eight CD/CD pairs, one UC/UC pair and one UC/IBDU pair. The discordant pairs comprised 31 UC, 5 IBDU (IBD unclassified), and 8 CD discordant pairs. In the co-twins not affected by IBD, calprotectin was above 100 \u03bcg/g in 2 participants, and above 50 \u03bcg/g in a further 5 participants.\nThe presented IBD twin cohorts are an excellent resource for bioinformatics studies with proper adjustment for disease-associated exposures including medication and inflammatory activity in the co-twins.",

Corneal refraction, anterior chamber depth and axial length were measured with a Zeiss IOL Master. Participants with eyes operated for cataract or glaucoma were excluded, but the grade of nuclear opacity was not recorded. The associations between the absolute values of AnisoSR, AnisoAST and AnisoSE with SR, AST, SE, corneal refractive power (CR), corneal astigmatism (CAST), anterior chamber depth (ACD) and axial length (AL) and with their interocular differences were calculated. When calculating the interdependencies of the differences, the real and absolute differences between the right and left eye were used.\nMeans\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviations for AnisoSR, AnisoAST and AnisoSE were 0.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.92 D, 0.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.41 D and 0.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.71 D, respectively.

Anisometropia of spherical refraction (AnisoSR), AnisoAST and AnisoSE were higher the more negative the values of SR or SE. Hyperopic ametropia did not increase these anisometropia values. The correlations of AnisoSR and AnisoSE with the absolute values of interocular differences in CR and AL were non-significant. Using the real values of the interocular differences, the respective correlations were significant. The correlation between the real interocular differences in CR and AL was negative (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.258, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Thus, the combined effect of the real interocular differences in CR and AL was a decrease in AnisoSR and AnisoSE (emmetropization).\nHigher AnisoSR and AnisoSE were associated with more myopic refraction and longer AL. Higher AnisoAST was associated with more negative SR and higher AST and CAST. The negative correlation between real interocular differences in CR and AL indicated their influence of emmetropization in AnisoSR and AnisoSE.",

The correlation between the real interocular differences in CR and AL was negative (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.258, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Thus, the combined effect of the real interocular differences in CR and AL was a decrease in AnisoSR and AnisoSE (emmetropization).",
