    "abstract": "Job's syndrome or autosomal dominant hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (Hyper-IgE) is a rare disorder that results from a STAT3 gene mutation, which results in the absence of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells and manifests as a severe immunodeficiency. Affected individuals suffer recurrent soft tissue and pulmonary infections among other manifestations, and the spectrum of the disease is still being characterized. We describe 2 sisters with Job's syndrome each with variable expressivity. However, both patients developed proteinuric kidney disease and had biopsies confirming the presence of immune complex glomerulonephritis with staining for immunoglobulins and complement components. Previous reports link Job's syndrome and the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but proliferative immune complex glomerulonephritis has not been described. We speculate that continual internal and external antigen exposure may induce an autoimmune process similar to SLE, which in turn may account for the immune complex disease in the kidney.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression share several clinical and etiological factors. Coping is a critical mediator of the relationship between stress and psychopathology and a point of clinical intervention for all three disorders. However, little is known about their degree of overlap in coping style, or the influence of unique or shared genetic diathesis. In this study, we examined five factors of coping within and across disorder proband and co-twin groups, modeled heritability, and tested for endophenotypic pattern in a sample of twin pairs recruited from the Swedish Twin Registry (N = 420). Although there was substantial phenotypic overlap across disorders, including low levels of Productive, Problem-Focused coping and high levels of Disengagement, each disorder was associated with a unique profile across other dimensions of coping. We also found evidence of heritability for three of five factors, yet little evidence of genotypic overlap among disorders contributing to similar strategy-use.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION. Pentalogy of Cantrell is a very rare congenital multiple malformation with the poor outcome. Syndrome included the following pentad: abdominal wall defect, a defect of the lower sternum, anterior diaphragm defect, ectopia cordis, as well as a variety of intracardiac anomalies.\nIn the fifteenth week of the twin pregnancy, ultrasound examination showed multiple anomalies in one, as well as the absence of the nose apex in the other twin. The autopsy of the fetuses was performed after the abortion had been approved by the Ethics Committee. The external examination of the fetus number one showed ectopic heart and omphalocele. The internal examination revealed the existence of sternum cleft, ectopic heart and part of the left lung outside the thoracic cavity, the presence of diaphragmatic hernia with protrusion of abdominal organs, heart with only one large vessel and the horseshoe kidney. The full expression of the Pentalogy of Cantrell was confirmed. The external and internal examination of the other twin showed just agenesis of the nose apex.\nRecognition and diagnosis of the syndrome is of the exceptional importance. Proper and timely diagnosis should contribute to good outcome of the pregnancy and delivery.",

    "abstract": "Background\u2003Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the most common causes of serious viral intrauterine infections. It is universally distributed among the human population with an average incidence of 0.15 to 2%. Indeed, at least half of the women in the reproductive age have evidence of prior CMV infection. Epidemiology and Pathogenicity\u2003However, it is not a usual practice to screen asymptomatic pregnant woman or neonates for CMV. Even if a mother developed a primary CMV infection during pregnancy, up to 90% of the newborns with congenital CMV will be asymptomatic at the time of birth. Only 5 to 7% of the infected babies will be acutely symptomatic, and the typical clinical presentation includes intrauterine growth restriction, microcephaly, various cutaneous manifestations (including petechiae and purpura), hematological abnormalities (particularly resistant thrombocytopenia), hepatosplenomegaly, chorioretinitis, hepatitis, etc. In contrast, acquired CMV infection is extremely unlikely to cause any serious sequelae for the infant. Cases\u2003 We present a case of congenital and acquired CMV infection in twins with a focus of dissimilarity in presentation, clinical course, and outcome.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the multifactorial etiology of mandibular tori analyzing the influence of genetics, occlusal overload, various clinical variables and their interactions.\nOverall, plaster casts of 162 twins (81 twin pairs) were analyzed for the presence or absence of mandibular tori. Atypical wear facets on canine tips or incisors were recorded to diagnose bruxism. Angle Class, any kind of anterior open bite and positive, negative or flat curve of Wilson were recorded. Zygosity determination was carried out using a DNA test.\nMandibular tori were found in 56.8% of the cases. In 93.6% of all monozygotic twin pairs both individuals had or did not have mandibular tori (\u03ba=0.96\u00b10.04; p<0.001), compared to 79.4% concordance of mandibular tori in dizygotic co-twins (\u03ba=0.7\u00b10.12; p<0.001). Prevalence of mandibular tori was significantly higher in the group of bruxers (67.5%) compared to non-bruxers (31.3%) (p<0.001). Significant association between mandibular tori and negative or flat curve of Wilson in the maxillary second premolars and first molars was found (OR=2.55, 95% CI (1.19-5.46), p=0.016). In all monozygotic bruxers, 97.1% showed concordance of mandibular tori presence in both co-twins compared to 78.9% dizygotic bruxers, and this difference is statistically significant (p=0.007).\nOur results suggest that the mandibular tori are of a multifactorial origin. Mandibular tori seem to have genetic predisposition, and may be associated with teeth grinding as well as with negative or flat CW in region of maxillary second premolar and first molar.",

The most prominent phenotypic features include hypotonia, developmental retardation, as well as typical dysmorphic face. It has been shown that terminal deletions of the chromosome 9q34.3 region, or EHMT1 gene mutations, lead to Kleefstra syndrome. We present 16-month-old twin sisters, one of whom had originally been referred for Down syndrome screening due to hypotonia, growth and development retardation, dysmorphic facial signs, and accompanying congenital heart disease. They were subsequently diagnosed as Kleefstra syndrome based on subtelomeric FISH analysis. In conclusion, Kleefstra syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of Down syndrome because it presents with very similar phenotypic features.",

    "abstract": "Progressive fetal growth restriction (FGR) is often an indication for delivery. In dichorionic diamniotic (DD) twin pregnancy with growth restriction only affecting one fetus (selective fetal growth restriction: sFGR), the normal twin is also delivered prematurely. There is still not enough evidence about the optimal timing of delivery for DD twins with sFGR in relation to discordance and gestational age. We report three sets of DD twins with sFGR (almost complete growth arrest affecting one fetus for \u22652 weeks) before 30 weeks of gestation. The interval from growth arrest to delivery was 21-24 days and the discordance was 33.7-49.8%. A large-scale study showed no difference of overall mortality or the long-term outcome between immediate and delayed delivery for FGR, while many studies have identified a risk of developmental delay following delivery of the normal growth fetus before 32 weeks. Therefore, delivery of DD twins with sFGR should be delayed if the condition of the sFGR fetus permits in order to increase the gestational age of the normal growth fetus.",

The etiology of neonatal hemochromatosis is not exactly understood. However, according to one theory neonatal hemochromatosis is believed to be an alloimmune disorder causing liver injury in the fetus. In order to diagnose neonatal hemochromatosis there are some criteria that should be taken into account, such as positive family history, high serum ferritin levels, high serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and siderosis demonstrated by histology or with magnetic resonance.We present a case of a monochorionic newborn twin who applied to our hospital with sepsis clinical symptoms like clinics, was diagnosed with NH and immediately treated with antioxidant therapy while the other twin with same clinical symptoms did not respond to therapy and passed away. NH should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases with sepsis-like clinical symptoms that do not respond to antibiotics; early antioxidant therapy in these cases is lifesaving.",

    "abstract": "Although the genetics of asthma has been extensively studied using both quantitative and molecular genetic analysis methods, both approaches lack studies specific to the childhood phenotype and including other allergic diseases. This study aimed to give specific estimates for the heritability of childhood asthma and other allergic diseases, to attempt to replicate findings from genomewide association studies (GWAS) for childhood asthma and to test the same variants against other allergic diseases.\nIn a cohort of 25 306 Swedish twins aged 9 or 12 years, data on asthma were available from parental interviews and population-based registers. The interviews also inquired about wheeze, hay fever, eczema, and food allergy. Through structural equation modeling, the heritability of all phenotypes was calculated. A subset of 10 075 twins was genotyped for 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from previous GWAS; these were first tested for association with asthma and significant findings also against the other allergic diseases.\nThe heritability of any childhood asthma was 0.82 (95% CI 0.79-0.85). For the other allergic diseases, the range was approximately 0.60-0.80. Associations for six SNPs with asthma were replicated, including rs2305480 in the GSDMB gene (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.86, P = 1.5*10(-8) ; other significant associations all below P = 3.5*10(-4) ). Of these, only rs3771180 in IL1RL1 was associated with any other allergic disease (for hay fever, OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53-0.77, P = 2.5*10(-6) ).\nAsthma and allergic diseases of childhood are highly heritable, and these high-risk genetic variants associated specifically with childhood asthma, except for one SNP shared with hay fever.",

    "abstract": "Few large epidemiologic studies have investigated the role of postweaning protein intake in excess weight and adiposity of young children, despite children in the United Kingdom consistently consuming protein in excess of their physiologic requirements.\nWe investigated whether a higher proportion of protein intake from energy beyond weaning is associated with greater weight gain, higher body mass index (BMI), and risk of overweight or obesity in children up to 5 y of age.\nParticipants were 2154 twins from the Gemini cohort. Dietary intake was collected by using a 3-d diet diary when the children had a mean age of 21 mo. Weight and height were collected every 3 mo, from birth to 5 y. Longitudinal models investigated associations of protein intake with BMI, weight, and height, with adjustment for age at diet diary, sex, total energy intake, birth weight/length, and rate of prior growth and clustering within families. Logistic regression investigated protein intake in relation to the odds of overweight or obesity at 3 and 5 y of age.\nA total of 2154 children had a mean \u00b1 SD of 5.7 \u00b1 3.2 weight and height measurements up to 5 y. Total energy from protein was associated with higher BMI (\u03b2 = 0.043; 95% CI: 0.011, 0.075) and weight (\u03b2 = 0.052; 95% CI: 0.031, 0.074) but not height (\u03b2 = 0.088; 95% CI: -0.038, 0.213) between 21 mo and 5 y. Substituting percentage energy from fat or carbohydrate for percentage energy from protein was associated with decreases in BMI and weight. Protein intake was associated with a trend in increased odds of overweight or obesity at 3 y (OR = 1.10; 95% CI 0.99, 1.22, P = 0.075), but the effect was not statistically significant at 5 y.\nA higher proportion of energy from protein during the complementary feeding stage is associated with greater increases in weight and BMI in early childhood in this large cohort of United Kingdom children.",

    "abstract": "Research supporting relationships between sleep quality, weight, depression and anxiety has typically examined the relationships separately rather than simultaneously, potentially hampering insights into the characteristics of reported links. This study aimed to fill this gap in the research to provide further insight into the factors associated with sleep.\nData from wave 4 of the G1219 cohort were used in cross-sectional analyses. The sample comprised 1392 adult twins and siblings aged 18-27 years. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire which included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index as a measure of sleep quality, the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire as a measure of depression symptoms and the Revised Symptoms of Anxiety Scale as a measure of anxiety symptoms. Participants were asked to self-report general health and weight and height so researchers could derive weight status from measures of body mass index.\nAn analysis of covariance including weight status, depression, anxiety and general health as predictors and sleep quality as the outcome revealed main effects of depression (F(3,1163)\u2009=\u200910.93, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and general health (F(4,1163)\u2009=\u20095.72, p\u2009<\u20090.001) only.\nA direct relationship between weight and sleep should not be assumed as it is possible that the relationship is at least in part accounted for by depression symptoms or general health. Depression symptoms and general health may also account for the association between sleep quality and anxiety symptoms in young adults.",

    "abstract": "Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk of problematic alcohol and other substance use in adolescence. This study used data from an ongoing, prospective, population-based twin study of Swedish children and adolescents to evaluate the extent to which the association between ADHD symptoms and alcohol problems reflects a unique source of genetic or environmental risk related to ADHD versus a broader predisposition to youth externalizing behavior. We used all available data from same-sex monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins on ADHD symptoms in childhood (age 9/12; N\u2009=\u200915,549) and alcohol problems in late adolescence (age 18; N\u2009=\u20092,564). Consistent with prior longitudinal studies, the phenotypic association between hyperactive/impulsive ADHD symptoms and alcohol problems was small in magnitude, whereas the association for inattentive symptoms was even weaker. Additive genetic influences explained 99.8% of the association between hyperactive/impulsive symptoms and alcohol problems. Furthermore, we found that the genetic risk specifically associated with hyperactive/impulsive symptoms was attenuated when estimated in the context of externalizing behavior liability during childhood, of which ADHD symptoms were specific expressions. In sensitivity analyses exploring hyperactivity in mid-adolescence, we found a similar pattern of genetic associations. These results are consistent with previous findings of genetically driven overlap in the etiology of ADHD and problematic alcohol use. At least some of this co-occurrence may result from a general predisposition to externalizing behaviors in youth. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Primary and secondary outcomes included mode of delivery, birthweight, stillbirth, Apgar score, neonatal unit admission, neonatal resuscitation, death and respiratory distress.\nOf 1261 women, 82.9% (1045/1261; 2090 babies) delivered at \u226532 weeks' gestation. The mode of delivery for these babies was as follows: normal vaginal delivery, 419 (20%); instrumental delivery, 179 (8.6%); emergency cesarean section, 658 (31.5%); and elective cesarean section, 834 (39.9%). Babies delivered by emergency cesarean section or instrumental vaginal delivery had worse outcome. In contrast, the lowest complications were seen in the uncomplicated vaginal delivery and elective cesarean section cohorts.\nNeonatal outcome was worse for those delivering via emergency cesarean section or instrumental vaginal delivery compared with elective cesarean section or uncomplicated vaginal delivery. The rate of uncomplicated vaginal delivery, however, was low, with only 14.8% of women delivering both babies vaginally without any form of intervention.",

    "abstract": "Here, we report a case of parapagus diprosopus twins with spina bifida diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound.\nA 28-year-old Taiwanese woman, gravid 1, para 0, visited our hospital due to an abnormal fetal head shape discovered by 2D ultrasound at 11-weeks gestation. Parapagus diprosopus twins with spina bifida were diagnosed after ultrasound examination. The characteristics of parapagus diprosopus twins are more illustrative in 3D ultrasound than in 2D ultrasound. After counseling, termination of pregnancy was chosen by the couple. Although necropsy was declined, the gross appearance and radiograph of the abortus confirmed our diagnosis.\nWith the help of 3D ultrasound, we made an early and definitive diagnosis of conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "Alteration of DNA methylation in mammalian cells could be elicited by many factors, including viral infections [1]. HIV has shown the ability to interact with host cellular factors to change the methylation status of some genes [2], [3], [4]. However, the change of the DNA methylation associated with HIV infection based on the whole genome has not been well illustrated. In this study, a unique pair of monozygotic twins was recruited: one of the twins was infected with HIV without further anti-retroviral therapy while the other one was healthy, which could be considered as a relatively ideal model for profiling the alterations of DNA methylation associated with HIV infection. Therefore, using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-microarray method (MeDIP-microarray), we found the increased DNA methylation level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV infected twin compared to her normal sibling. Moreover, several distinguished differential methylation regions (DMRs) in HIV infected twin worth further study. The raw data has been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets with reference number GSE68028.",

    "abstract": "The possible pathophysiology of the relationship between gastro-esophageal reflux disease and apnea of prematurity has been widely investigated. Various physiological protective reflex responses provide a plausible biological link between gastro-esophageal reflux and apnea of prematurity. It is uncertain whether or not there is a causal relationship between the two diseases. PATIENT'S FINDINGS: Twins were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit due to feeding problems. Physical examination was normal except for reticulated, blueviolet skin changes. Short apneic attacks occurred on the first day in twin 1 and on the second day in twin 2, and these were initially treated by stimulation and increased ambient O2 concentration. Then, we conducted methylxanthine and continuous positive airway pressure treatment. Laboratory and radiological analysis were normal. As gastro-esophageal reflux disease was thought to be the causes of the treatment-refractory apnea, therapy with gaviscon and domperidon was begun for both cases. Apneic attacks did not recur after gaviscon and domperidon therapy.\nPharmacological therapy for gastro-esophageal reflux disease has not definitively been shown to be effective in improving symptoms and hence, should be reserved especially for infants with treatment refractory apnea episodes suspected as being gastro-esophageal reflux in premature infants.\n\u80cc\u666f\uff1a\u80c3\u98df\u7ba1\u53cd\u6d41\u75c5\u548c\u65e9\u4ea7\u513f\u547c\u5438\u6682\u505c\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb \u7814\u7a76\u3002\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u7406\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\u53cd\u5c04\u5e94\u7b54\u4e3a\u80c3\u98df\u7ba1\u53cd\u6d41\u548c\u65e9\u4ea7\u513f\u547c\u5438\u6682\u505c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408 \u7406\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u4e8c\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u5c1a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u3002\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3 \u679c\uff1a\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u56e0\u4e3a\u5582\u517b\u95ee\u9898\u88ab\u9001\u8fdb\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u91cd\u75c7\u76d1\u62a4\u75c5\u623f\uff0c\u4f53\u683c\u68c0\u67e5\u53d1\u73b0\u9664\u4e86\u7f51 \u72b6\u84dd\u7d2b\u8272\u76ae\u80a4\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u5176\u5b83\u6b63\u5e38\u3002\u53cc\u80de\u80ce1 \u548c\u53cc\u80de\u80ce2 \u5206\u522b\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u5929\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5929\u53d1 \u751f\u4e86\u77ed\u6682\u7684\u547c\u5438\u6682\u505c\u3002\u6700\u521d\u6211\u4eec\u91c7\u7528\u523a\u6fc0\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6c27\u6c14\u6d53\u5ea6\u6765\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u7136\u540e \u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7532\u57fa\u9ec4\u560c\u5464\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6c14\u9053\u6b63\u538b\u901a\u6c14\u6cbb\u7597\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u548c\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u5747\u6b63\u5e38\u3002\u56e0 \u4e3a\u80c3\u98df\u7ba1\u53cd\u6d41\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u96be\u6cbb\u6027\u547c\u5438\u6682\u505c\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5f00\u59cb\u7528\u5609\u80c3\u65af\u5eb7 \u548c \u591a\u6f58\u7acb\u916e \u6cbb\u7597\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5609\u80c3\u65af\u5eb7 \u548c \u591a\u6f58\u7acb\u916e\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u6ca1\u6709\u518d\u53d1\u751f\u7a92\u606f\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u80c3\u98df \u7ba1\u53cd\u6d41\u75c5\u7684\u836f\u7269\u6cbb\u7597\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u75c7\u72b6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u96be\u6cbb \u6027\u547c\u5438\u6682\u505c\u7591\u4f3c\u6709\u80c3\u98df\u7ba1\u53cd\u6d41\u7684\u65e9\u4ea7\u513f\u65f6\u5e94\u8c28\u614e\u3002.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is the most common chronic inflammatory disorder in children. The aetiology of asthma pathology is complex and highly heterogeneous, involving the interplay between genetic and environmental risk factors that is hypothesized to involve epigenetic processes. Our aim was to explore whether methylomic variation in early childhood is associated with discordance for asthma symptoms within monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs recruited from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) longitudinal twin study. We also aimed to identify differences in DNA methylation that are associated with asthma that develops in childhood and persists into early adulthood as these may represent useful prognostic biomarkers.\nWe examined genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in buccal cell samples collected from 37 MZ twin pairs discordant for asthma at age 10. DNA methylation at individual CpG sites demonstrated significant variability within discordant MZ twin pairs with the top-ranked nominally significant differentially methylated position (DMP) located in the HGSNAT gene. We stratified our analysis by assessing DNA methylation differences in a sub-group of MZ twin pairs who remained persistently discordant for asthma at age 18. The top-ranked nominally significant DMP associated with persisting asthma is located in the vicinity of the HLX gene, which has been previously implicated in childhood asthma.\nWe identified DNA methylation differences associated with childhood asthma in peripheral DNA samples from discordant MZ twin pairs. Our data suggest that differences in DNA methylation associated with childhood asthma which persists into early adulthood are distinct from those associated with asthma which remits.",

    "results": "We examined genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in buccal cell samples collected from 37 MZ twin pairs discordant for asthma at age 10. DNA methylation at individual CpG sites demonstrated significant variability within discordant MZ twin pairs with the top-ranked nominally significant differentially methylated position (DMP) located in the HGSNAT gene. We stratified our analysis by assessing DNA methylation differences in a sub-group of MZ twin pairs who remained persistently discordant for asthma at age 18. The top-ranked nominally significant DMP associated with persisting asthma is located in the vicinity of the HLX gene, which has been previously implicated in childhood asthma.",

    "abstract": "Twin pairs with the imprinting disorder Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) have rarely been reported. All six monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs described so far were clinically discordant. In two of the four SRS twin pairs with molecularly proven 11p15.5 epimutation, the healthy twin also showed the molecular alteration in blood cells, but not in the other tested tissues. The clinical discordance is a well-known but poorly understood observation because MZ twins derive from the same zygote. For the second 11p15.5-associated imprinting disorder, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a larger number of twins has been described, here the majority of pairs are MZ but clinically discordant as well. Interestingly, there is a considerable preponderance of females among the MZ twins with BWS, and a functional link between altered imprinting and X chromosome inactivation has been suggested. We now describe two further MZ SRS twins with H19/IGF2:IG-DMR hypomethylation, including the first clinically concordant pair. By summarizing the existing data, an excess of females in MZ twins with SRS is observed, thus confirming the hypothesis that X-chromosome inactivation might trigger the inaccurate methylation of imprinted loci at least in female twin conceptions. The occurrence of a MZ concordant SRS twin pair is exceptional. The detailed molecular characterization of both siblings of a twin pair enables a reliable diagnosis, furthermore it allows insights in the etiology of twinning in association with (aberrant) imprinting marking.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present work was to estimate the risk of monochorionic twin (MCT) pregnancies in in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles using data from a prenatal diagnosis unit. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study reporting on the frequency of IVF pregnancies among women attending a prenatal diagnosis service specifically dedicated to the management of monochorionic pregnancies. The observed rate was compared with the local regional rate of IVF births (2.2%). A binomial distribution model was used to calculate the 95% CI of proportions. One hundred and forty-five monochorionic pregnancies were selected. Ten of these were achieved with IVF, corresponding to a rate of 6.9% (95% CI: 3.5-11.8), significantly higher than the background rate in the local population of 2.2%. When considering exclusively monochorionic pregnancies achieving delivery of two viable newborns (n = 132), the number of IVF pregnancies was nine (6.8%, 95% CI: 3.7-12.5). We did not detect major differences in pregnancy outcome between IVF and natural monochorionic pregnancies, with the exception of the proportion of newborns with a neonatal birth < 2,500 g (100% vs. 80%, p = .03). In conclusion, data obtained from the perspective of a prenatal diagnosis unit suggest that women undergoing IVF face a 3- to 4-fold increased risk of monochorionic pregnancies.",

The mean maternal age was significantly higher in IVF compared with in spontaneously conceived pregnancies (33.8 \u00b1 5.5 vs. 31.6 \u00b1 5.4, respectively). Thirty-seven twins (11.3%) had TTTS, of whom 36/284 (12.7%) versus 1/43 (2.3%) were spontaneously and IVF conceived, respectively. The mean week of delivery was significantly lower in MC twins diagnosed with TTTS compared with those without TTTS (32.7 \u00b1 3.3 vs. 35.5 \u00b1 2.5, respectively). Furthermore, there was a significantly higher birthweight discordancy in twins diagnosed with TTTS compared with those without (20.6% vs. 11%, respectively).\nThe significantly lower proportion of TTTS found in IVF-conceived twins may suggest a different embryological process that lies at the core of IVF conception of monozygotic twinning.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences in religion are well known, with females generally being more religious than males, and shared environmental factors have been suggested to have a large influence on religiousness. Twins from opposite-sex (OS) and same-sex (SS) pairs may differ because of a dissimilar psycho-social rearing environment and/or because of different exposures to hormones in utero. We hypothesized that OS females may display more masculine patterns of religiousness and, vice versa, that OS males may display more feminine patterns. We used a web-based survey conducted in Denmark, which is a secular society. The survey included 2,997 twins aged 20-40 years, identified through the population-based Danish Twin Registry. We applied la Cour and Hvidt's adaptation of Fishman's three conceptual dimensions of meaning: Cognition, Practice, and Importance, and we used Pargament's measure of religious coping (RCOPE) for the assessment of positive and negative religious coping patterns. Differences between OS and SS twins were investigated using logistic regression for each sex. The analyses were adjusted for dependence within twin pairs. No significant differences in religiousness and religious coping were found for OS and SS twins except that more OS than SS females were members of the Danish National Evangelical Lutheran Church and fewer OS than SS females were Catholic, Muslim, or belonged to other religious denominations. Moreover, OS males at age 12 had higher rates of church attendance than did SS males. This study did not provide evidence for masculinization of female twins with male co-twins with regard to religiousness. Nor did it show any significant differences between OS and SS males except from higher rates of church attendance in childhood among males with female co-twins.",

    "abstract": "By definition, monozygotic (MZ) twins carry an identical set of genetic information. The observation of early post-twinning mutational events was shown to cause phenotypic discordance among MZ twin pairs. These mutational events comprise genomic alterations at different scales, ranging from single nucleotide changes to larger copy-number variations (CNVs) of varying sizes, as well as epigenetic changes. Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in nine discordant MZ twins to identify somatic mutational events in the affected twin that might exert a dominant negative effect. Five of these MZ twin pairs were discordant for congenital heart defects (CHD), two for endocrine disorders, one for omphalocele, and one for congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Analysis of WES data from all nine MZ twin pairs using the de novo probability tool DeNovoGear detected only one apparent de novo variation in TMPRSS13 in one of the CHD-affected twins. Analysis of WES data from all nine MZ twin pairs by using standard filter criteria without the de novo probability tool DeNovoGear revealed a total of 6,657 variations in which both the twin pairs differed. After filtering for variations only present in the affected twins and absent in in-house controls, 722 variations remained. Visual inspection for read quality decreased this number to 12, present only in the affected twin. However, Sanger sequencing of the overall 13 variations failed to confirm the variation in the affected twin. These results suggest that somatic mutational events in coding regions do not seem to play a major role in the phenotypic expression of MZ discordant twin pairs.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetics describes the study of cellular modifications that can modify the expression of genes without changing the DNA sequence. DNA methylation is one of the most stable and prevalent epigenetic mechanisms. Twin studies have been a valuable model for unraveling the genetic and epigenetic epidemiology of complex traits, and now offer a potential to dissect the factors that impact DNA methylation variability and its biomedical significance. The twin design specifically allows for the study of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors, and their potential interactions, on epigenetic profiles. Furthermore, genetically identical twins offer a unique opportunity to assess nongenetic impacts on epigenetic profiles. Here, we summarize recent findings from twin studies of DNA methylation profiles across tissues, to define current knowledge regarding the genetic and nongenetic factors that influence epigenetic variation.",

    "abstract": "Diurnal preference is an individual's preference for daily activities and sleep timing and is strongly correlated with the underlying circadian clock and the sleep-wake cycle validating its use as an indirect circadian measure in humans. Recent research has implicated DNA methylation as a mechanism involved in the regulation of the circadian clock system in humans and other mammals. In order to evaluate the extent of epigenetic differences associated with diurnal preference, we examined genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in DNA from monozygotic (MZ) twin-pairs discordant for diurnal preference. MZ twins were selected from a longitudinal twin study designed to investigate the interplay of genetic and environmental factors in the development of emotional and behavioral difficulties. Fifteen pairs of MZ twins were identified in which one member scored considerably higher on the Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) than the other. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were assessed in twins' buccal cell DNA using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Quality control and data pre-processing was undertaken using the wateRmelon package. Differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were identified using an analysis strategy taking into account both the significance and the magnitude of DNA methylation differences. Our data indicate that DNA methylation differences are detectable in MZ twins discordant for diurnal preference. Moreover, downstream gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the top-ranked diurnal preference associated DMPs revealed significant enrichment of pathways that have been previously associated with circadian rhythm regulation, including cell adhesion processes and calcium ion binding.",

In cases in which there is an extensive sharing of organs, but nevertheless two distinguishable functioning brains, there are a number of philosophical and ethical challenges. This is because such conjoined twins: 1. give rise to puzzles concerning our identity, about whether we are identical to something psychological or biological; 2. force us to decide whether what matters from an ethical point of view is the biological life of our organisms or the existence of our consciousness or mind; 3. raise questions concerning when, if ever, it is morally acceptable to sacrifice one of us to save another; 4. force us to reflect on the conditions for ownership of organs and the justification of removal of organs for transplantation which causes the death of the donor; 5. raise questions about who should take decisions about life-risking treatments when this cannot be decided by patients themselves. We examine and suggest answers to these questions.",

Characteristic purplish patches develop over the medial and lateral malleoli of the ankles, the metacarpophalangeal joints, spine and elbows, with progressive joint contractures, osteopenia, skin abnormalities and chronic severe pain. The present case reports the occurrence of infantile systemic hyalinosis in twin brothers five months of age who had come for early intervention for joint contractures representing characteristic brownish patches over bony prominences. ISH cases reported until this date have been less than 20 and the present case is unique in nature since this is the first time ISH is reported in twins globally and the symptoms have been identified at an early age.",

    "abstract": "Patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders (for example, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) have elevated risks of committing violent acts, particularly if they are comorbid with substance misuse. Despite recent insights from quantitative and molecular genetic studies demonstrating considerable pleiotropy in the genetic architecture of these phenotypes, there is currently a lack of large-scale studies that have specifically examined the aetiological links between psychotic disorders and violence. Using a sample of all Swedish individuals born between 1958 and 1989 (n=3 332 101), we identified a total of 923\u2009259 twin-sibling pairs. Patients were identified using the National Patient Register using validated algorithms based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 8-10. Univariate quantitative genetic models revealed that all phenotypes (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, substance misuse, and violent crime) were highly heritable (h(2)=53-71%). Multivariate models further revealed that schizophrenia was a stronger predictor of violence (r=0.32; 95% confidence interval: 0.30-0.33) than bipolar disorder (r=0.23; 0.21-0.25), and large proportions (51-67%) of these phenotypic correlations were explained by genetic factors shared between each disorder, substance misuse, and violence. Importantly, we found that genetic influences that were unrelated to substance misuse explained approximately a fifth (21%; 20-22%) of the correlation with violent criminality in bipolar disorder but none of the same correlation in schizophrenia (Pbipolar disorder<0.001; Pschizophrenia=0.55). These findings highlight the problems of not disentangling common and unique sources of covariance across genetically similar phenotypes as the latter sources may include aetiologically important clues. Clinically, these findings underline the importance of assessing risk of different phenotypes together and integrating interventions for psychiatric disorders, substance misuse, and violence.",

    "abstract": "The increase in the number of forensic genetic loci used for identification purposes results in infinitesimal random match probabilities. These probabilities are computed under assumptions made for rather simple population genetic models. Often, the forensic expert reports likelihood ratios, where the alternative hypothesis is assumed not to encompass close relatives. However, this approach implies that important factors present in real human populations are discarded. This approach may be very unfavourable to the defendant. In this paper, we discuss some important aspects concerning the closest familial relationship, i.e., identical (monozygotic) twins, when reporting the weight of evidence. This can be done even when the suspect has no knowledge of an identical twin or when official records hold no twin information about the suspect. The derived expressions are not original as several authors previously have published results accounting for close familial relationships. However, we revisit the discussion to increase the awareness among forensic genetic practitioners and include new information on medical and societal factors to assess the risk of not considering a monozygotic twin as the true perpetrator. If accounting for a monozygotic twin in the weight of evidence, it implies that the likelihood ratio is truncated at a maximal value depending on the prevalence of monozygotic twins and the societal efficiency of recognising a monozygotic twin. If a monozygotic twin is considered as an alternative proposition, then data relevant for the Danish society suggests that the threshold of likelihood ratios should approximately be between 150,000 and 2,000,000 in order to take the risk of an unrecognised identical, monozygotic twin into consideration. In other societies, the threshold of the likelihood ratio in crime cases may reach other, often lower, values depending on the recognition of monozygotic twins and the age of the suspect. In general, more strictly kept registries will imply larger thresholds on the likelihood ratio as the monozygotic twin explanation gets less probable.",

    "abstract": "A history of complex febrile seizures can increase the risk of epilepsy, but the role of genetic factors is unclear. This analysis evaluated the relationship between febrile seizures and epilepsy.\nInformation on the history of seizures was obtained by a questionnaire from twin pairs in the Mid-Atlantic, Danish, and Norwegian Twin Registries. The information was verified using medical records and detailed clinical and family interviews. The initial study evaluated the genetic epidemiology of febrile seizures in this population. Further information was analyzed and used to evaluate genetic associations of different febrile seizure subtypes.\nHistories of febrile seizures were validated in 1051 twins in 900 pairs. The febrile seizure type was classified as simple, complex, or febrile status epilepticus. There were 61% simple, 12% complex, and 7% febrile status epilepticus. There were 78 twins who developed epilepsy. The highest rate of epilepsy (22.2%) occurred in the febrile status epilepticus group. Concordance was highest in simple group.\nA twin with febrile status epilepticus is at the highest risk of developing epilepsy, but simple febrile seizures gave the highest risk for the unaffected twin to develop seizures or other neurological issues. These results are consistent with previous findings. There is a subgroup of febrile seizures that can be associated with long-term consequences. This subgroup can be associated with a significant financial and emotional burden. It is currently not possible to accurately identify which children will develop recurrent febrile seizures, epilepsy, or neuropsychological comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous preterm birth (SPB) is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. In twins, the rate of preterm birth is higher than in singletons; interventions to prevent preterm birth are needed in this high-risk population.\nWe sought to test whether a cervical pessary reduces the preterm birth rate in twin pregnancies with sonographic short cervix.\nA prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted in 5 hospitals in Spain. The ethics committees of all participating hospitals approved the protocol. The trial was registered as ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01242410. Eligible women were scanned in Spain. The primary outcome was SPB <34 weeks of gestation. Neonatal morbidity and mortality were also evaluated.\nCervical length was measured in 2287 women; 137 pregnant women with a sonographic cervical length \u226425 mm (of 154 detected with a short cervix) were randomly assigned to receive a cervical pessary or expectant management (1:1 ratio). SPB <34 weeks of gestation was significantly less frequent in the pessary group than in the expectant management group (11/68 [16.2%] vs 26/66 [39.4%]; relative risk, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.76). Pessary use was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of birthweight <2500 g (P\u00a0= .01). No significant differences were observed in composite neonatal morbidity outcome (8/136 [5.9%] vs 12/130 [9.1%]; relative risk, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-1.50) or neonatal mortality (none) between the groups. No serious adverse effects associated with the use of a cervical pessary were observed.\nThe insertion of a cervical pessary was associated with a significant reduction in the SPB rate. We propose the use of a cervical pessary for preventing preterm birth in twin pregnancies of mothers with a short cervix.",

    "abstract": "In view of criticism regarding the usefulness of heritability coefficients, the aim of this study was to analyze separately the information on genetic and environmental variability. Such an approach, based on the normalization of trait's variability for its value, is determined by the coefficients of genetic polymorphism (Pg) and ecosensitivity (De). The studied material included 1263 twin pairs of both sexes (among them 424 pairs of monozygotic twins and 839 pairs of dizygotic twins) born between the 22nd and 41st week of gestation. Variability of six somatic traits was analyzed. The zygosity of same-sex twins was determined based on the polymorphism of DNA from lymphocytes of the umbilical cord blood, obtained at birth. The coefficients of genetic polymorphism and ecosensitivity for analyzed traits of male and female twins born at various months of gestation were calculated. Our study revealed that a contribution of the genetic component predominated over that of the environmental component in determining the phenotypic variability of somatic traits of newborns from twin pregnancies. The genetically determined phenotypic variability in male twins was greater than in the females. The genetic polymorphism and ecosensitivity of somatic traits were relatively stable during the period of fetal ontogeny analyzed in this study. Only in the case of body weight, a slight increase in the genetic contribution of polygenes to the phenotypic variance could be observed with gestational age, along with a slight decrease in the influence of environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, epigenetic analyses have made important contributions to our understanding of healthy development and a wide variety of adverse conditions such as cancer and psychopathology. There is increasing evidence that DNA methylation is a mechanism by which environmental factors influence gene transcription and, ultimately, phenotype. However, differentiating the effects of the environment from those of genetics on DNA methylation profiles remains a significant challenge. Monozygotic (MZ) twin study designs are unique in their ability to control for genetic differences because each pair of MZ twins shares essentially the same genetic sequence with the exception of a small number of de novo mutations and copy number variations. Thus, differences within twin pairs in gene expression and phenotype, including behavior, can be attributed in the majority of cases to environmental effects rather than genetic influence. In this article, we review the literature showing how MZ twin designs can be used to study basic epigenetic principles, contributing to understanding the role of early in utero and postnatal environmental factors on the development of psychopathology. We also highlight the importance of initiating longitudinal and experimental studies with MZ twins during pregnancy. This approach is especially important to identify: (1) critical time periods during which the early environment can impact brain and mental health development, and (2) the specific mechanisms through which early environmental effects may be mediated. These studies may inform the optimum timing and design for early preventive interventions aimed at reducing risk for psychopathology.",

    "abstract": "The skin is the outermost layer of the human body and one of the key sites for host-microbe interactions. Both environmental and host genetic factors influence microbial communities in distinct anatomical niches, but little is known about their interplay in shaping the skin microbiome. Here, we investigate the heritable components of the skin microbiome and their association with host genetic factors.\nBased on our analysis of the microbiota from 45 individuals including monozygotic and dizygotic twins aged 26-55 years and their mothers, we found that skin microbial diversity was significantly influenced by age and skin pigmentation. Heritability analysis revealed genetic and shared environmental impacts on the skin microbiome. Furthermore, we observed a strong association between the abundance of Corynebacterium jeikeium and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the host FLG gene related to epidermal barrier function.\nThis study reveals an intimate association of the human skin microbiome and host genes, and increases our understanding of the role of human genetic factors in establishing a microbial ecosystem on the body surface.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal sialadenitis is a rare condition. The vast majority of cases are caused by Staphylococcus aureus with predominant involvement of the parotid gland and need for long-term antimicrobial therapy. We reviewed three distinct cases of submandibular sialadenitis in preterm infants from monochorionic pregnancies. The association with neonatal sialadenitis is unproven. We speculate about the role of fetal distress and circulatory compromise in monochorionic twins as a risk factor in the development of this serious condition.",

    "abstract": "Primary hip osteoarthritis, radiographic as well as symptomatic, is highly associated with increasing age in both genders. However, little is known about the mechanisms behind this, in particular if this increase is caused by genetic factors. This study examined the risk and heritability of primary osteoarthritis of the hip leading to a total hip arthroplasty, and if this heritability increased with increasing age.\nIn a nationwide population-based follow-up study 118,788 twins from the Danish Twin Register and 90,007 individuals from the Danish Hip Arthroplasty Register for the period 1995 to 2010 were examined. Our main outcomes were the cumulative incidence, proband-wise concordance and heritability on age, within-pair correlations in monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, and the genetic and environmental influence estimated in models taking into account that individuals may not have had a total hip arthroplasty at the time of follow-up.\nThere were 94,063 twins eligible for analyses, comprising 835 cases of 36 concordant and 763 discordant twin pairs. The probability increased particularly from 50 years of age. After sex and age adjustment a significant additive genetic component of 47% (12:79), a shared environmental component of 21% (2:76) and a unique environment component of 32% (21:41) accounted for the variation in population liability to total hip arthroplasty. The sex-adjusted proband-wise concordance and heritability on age indicated an increasing age-associated genetic influence onwards from 60 years of age.\nThe cumulative incidence in primary hip osteoarthritis leading to total hip arthroplasty increases in particular after the age of 50 years in both genders. Family factors of genes and shared environment are highly significant and account for 68% of the variation in the population liability to total hip arthroplasty; however, the genetic influence increases significantly from 60 years of age onwards.",

    "abstract": "Genetic or environmental influences on cerebral glucose metabolism are unknown. We attempted to reveal these influences in elderly twins by means of (18)F-FDG PET.\n(18)F-FDG uptake was studied in 40 monozygotic and 18 dizygotic volunteer twin pairs aged 30 y or over. We also created 18 control pairs by pairing age- and sex-matched genetically unrelated subjects from dizygotic and monozygotic pairs. SUV images of the brain were reconstructed and analyzed by voxel-based statistical analysis with automated region-of-interest setting. The (18)F-FDG uptake in each cerebral lobe was semiquantified by taking a ratio of SUVmean in each region of interest to whole-brain SUVaverage. We calculated an intraclass correlation coefficient of SUV ratio in each region of interest for monozygotic and dizygotic pairs. By comparing differences in coefficients between monozygotic and dizygotic pairs, genetic and environmental contributions were estimated.\nThe intraclass correlation coefficient in monozygotic pairs was significantly higher than that in dizygotic pairs in the parietal lobes bilaterally (P < 0.001) and in the left temporal lobe (P < 0.05) but was not significantly different in other lobes.\nThe present study indicated that in the right and left parietal lobes and left temporal lobe, cerebral glucose metabolism is influenced more by genetics than by environment, whereas in other brain regions the influence of environment is dominant.",

    "abstract": "Discordant growth is a common complication of monochorionic/diamniotic pregnancies; in approximately 50% of cases, the cause is unknown. The case presented here suggests that discordant growth of monozygotic twins could start during preimplantation development. Two inner cell masses (ICMs) within the same blastocyst may originate in uneven splitting of a single \"parental\" ICM, or the two ICMs may be formed independently de novo. We studied the transcriptomes of two morphologically distinct ICMs within a single blastocyst using high-resolution RNA sequencing. The data indicated that the two ICM were at different stages of development; one was in the earliest stages of lineage commitment, while the other had already differentiated into epiblast and primitive endoderm. IGF1-mediated signaling is likely to play a key role in ICM growth and to be the major driver behind these differences.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies are commonly associated with low birth weight (LBW) infants. Most studies focus on growth of LBW compared with normal infants in singleton. However, there has not been any study on twins to compare LBW with normal birth weight (NBW) infants as a match control of the same twin.\nThis cohort study was conducted at Healthcare centers of Kashan, in 2013. Twins differing in birth weight (one with LBW and the other with NBW) were assessed using the care charts in Well Care program in regard to weight, height and head circumference measurements at birth and after 6, 12, 24 months of age and were compared separately between all matched pairs and in four sex-twin subgroups which was defined according to the sex of each twin in pairs; SF (Same-sex: Female), SM (Same-sex: Male), LF (LBW: Female) and LM (LBW: Male).\nIncidence of dissimilar twins in birth weight was 28.4%. The weight of LBW was significantly lower than the NBW cohort in SF and LF subgroups up to 24 months. The height of LBW was not significantly different from NBW cohort in SM and LM subgroups up to 24 month. Head circumference was significantly higher in LBW compared to NBW cohort in LM subgroup up to 24 month. However, these indices were significantly lower in LBW compared to NBW cohort in all pairs.\nAlthough LBW cohort was significantly lower than the NBW in growth indices at birth to 2 years old in all twins, however, highly variable results was observed in four subgroups of sex-twin.",

    "abstract": "Sirtuins (SIRTs) regulate cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function according to the energy state of the cell reflected by NAD(+) levels.\nOur aim was to determine whether expressions of SIRTs and NAD(+) biosynthesis genes are affected by acquired obesity and how possible alterations are connected with metabolic dysfunction while controlling for genetic and familial factors.\nWe studied a cross-sectional sample of 40 healthy pairs of monozygotic twins, including 26 pairs who were discordant for body mass index (within-pair difference > 3 kg/m(2)), from the FinnTwin12 and FinnTwin16 cohorts.\nSubcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) transcriptomics was analyzed by using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 chips, total SAT (poly-ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) activity by an ELISA kit, body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy, and insulin sensitivity by an oral glucose tolerance test.\nSIRT1, SIRT3, SIRT5, NAMPT, NMNAT2, NMNAT3, and NRK1 expressions were significantly down-regulated and the activity of main cellular NAD(+) consumers, PARPs, trended to be higher in the SAT of heavier co-twins of body mass index-discordant pairs. Controlling for twin-shared factors, SIRT1, SIRT3, NAMPT, NMNAT3, and NRK1 were significantly negatively correlated with adiposity, SIRT1, SIRT5, NMNAT2, NMNAT3, and NRK1 were negatively correlated with inflammation, and SIRT1 and SIRT5 were positively correlated with insulin sensitivity. Expressions of genes involved in mitochondrial unfolded protein response were also significantly down-regulated in the heavier co-twins.\nOur data highlight a strong relationship of reduced NAD(+)/SIRT pathway expression with acquired obesity, inflammation, insulin resistance, and impaired mitochondrial protein homeostasis in SAT.",

    "abstract": "We investigated whether expression of genes previously implicated in arterial stiffening associates with cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of arterial stiffness. Women from the Twins UK cohort (n=470, aged 39-81 years) had gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines measured using an Illumina microarray. Arterial stiffness was measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and carotid distensibility. A subsample (n=121) of women had repeat vascular measures after a mean\u00b1SD follow-up of 4.3\u00b11.4 years. Associations of arterial phenotypes with gene expression levels were examined for 52 genes identified from previous association studies. The gene transcript most closely associated with pulse wave velocity in cross-sectional analysis was ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (P=0.012). Pleiotropic genetic effects accounted for 14% of the phenotypic correlation between ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase expression and pulse wave velocity. Progression of pulse wave velocity during the follow-up period best related to expression of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (\u03b2=0.19, P=0.008) and collagen type IV \u03b1 1 (\u03b2=0.32, P<0.0001). Gene transcripts most closely related to change in carotid distensibility during the follow-up period were endothelial nitric oxide synthase (\u03b2=-0.20, P=0.005), angiotensin-converting enzyme (\u03b2=-0.15, P=0.035), and B-cell CLL/lymphoma11B (\u03b2=0.18, P=0.010). Expression levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme also related to progression in carotid diameter (\u03b2=0.21, P=0.012). Expression levels of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase, involved in arterial calcification, and collagen type IV \u03b1 1, involved in collagen formation, correlate with aortic stiffening. These genes may be functional mediators of arterial stiffening.",

    "abstract": "Low birth weight (LBW) can have an impact on health outcomes in later life, especially in relation to pre-disposition to metabolic disease. Several studies suggest that LBW resulting from restricted intrauterine growth leaves a footprint on DNA methylation in utero, and this influence likely persists into adulthood. To investigate this further, we performed epigenome-wide association analyses of blood DNA methylation using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip profiles in 71 adult monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs who were extremely discordant for birth weight. A signal mapping to the IGF1R gene (cg12562232, p = 2.62 \u00d7 10(-8)), was significantly associated with birth weight discordance at a genome-wide false-discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05. We pursued replication in three additional independent datasets of birth weight discordant MZ pairs and observed the same direction of association, but the results were not significant. However, a meta-analysis across the four independent samples, in total 216 birth-weight discordant MZ twin pairs, showed a significant positive association between birth weight and DNA methylation differences at IGF1R (random-effects meta-analysis p = .04), and the effect was particularly pronounced in older twins (random-effects meta-analysis p = .008, 98 older birth-weight discordant MZ twin pairs). The results suggest that severe intra-uterine growth differences (birth weight discordance >20%) are associated with methylation changes in the IGF1R gene in adulthood, independent of genetic effects.",

    "abstract": "Mosaic trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) in monozygotic diamniotic liveborn twins is rare. We describe such a case involving preterm male infants. Although both infants had a low percentage of trisomy 18 cells in peripheral blood leucocytes, their varied phenotypic presentation of mosaic trisomy 18 resulted in one twin surviving, with the other twin's demise at 1 month of age. Despite the presence of trisomy 18 in peripheral leucocytes, further analysis of a buccal smear and skin biopsy of the surviving twin did not show evidence of trisomy 18. Establishing such diagnoses in a timely manner is imperative for the child, parents and clinicians. The clinical course of these twins reflects the unpredictable prognosis associated with the diagnosis of mosaic trisomy 18, and emphasises the challenges that can be encountered when counselling parents.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among aging Vietnam-era veterans is not well characterized.\nIn a cross-sectional study, 5,598 male Vietnam-era veterans and members of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry were assessed for PTSD using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Current symptoms were measured with the PTSD Checklist (PCL). PTSD was estimated according to age (<60 or\u00a0\u2265 60) and Vietnam theater service.\nThe lifetime prevalence of PTSD in theater veterans aged at least 60 years was 16.9% (95% CI: 13.9%-20.5%) and higher than the 5.5% (95% CI: 4.3%-7.0%) among nontheater veterans. Among veterans younger than 60 years, the comparable prevalence was 22.0% for theater (95% CI: 16.7%-28.4%) and 15.7% for nontheater (95% CI: 13.4%-18.2%) veterans. Similar results were found for theater service and current PTSD prevalence (past 12 months). PCL scores were significantly higher in theater compared with nontheater veterans in both younger and older cohorts. In both the younger and older cohorts significant differences in lifetime and current PTSD prevalence and PCL scores persisted in theater service discordant twin pairs.\nVietnam service is related to elevated PTSD prevalence and current symptom burden in aging veterans. More than 30 years after the end of the Vietnam conflict, many veterans continue to suffer from PTSD, which highlights the need for continuing outreach throughout the life course.",

    "abstract": "Viral agents are of interest as possible autoimmune triggers due to prior reported associations and widely studied molecular mechanisms of antiviral immune responses in autoimmunity. Here we examined new viral candidates for the initiation and/or promotion of systemic autoimmune diseases (SAID), as well as possible related signaling pathways shared in the pathogenesis of those disorders. RNA isolated from peripheral blood samples from 33 twins discordant for SAID and 33 matched, unrelated healthy controls was analyzed using a custom viral-human gene microarray. Paired comparisons were made among three study groups-probands with SAID, their unaffected twins, and matched, unrelated healthy controls-using statistical and molecular pathway analyses. Probands and unaffected twins differed significantly in the expression of 537 human genes, and 107 of those were associated with viral infections. These 537 differentially expressed human genes participate in overlapping networks of several canonical, biologic pathways relating to antiviral responses and inflammation. Moreover, certain viral genes were expressed at higher levels in probands compared to either unaffected twins or unrelated, healthy controls. Interestingly, viral gene expression levels in unaffected twins appeared intermediate between those of probands and the matched, unrelated healthy controls. Of the viruses with overexpressed viral genes, herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) was the only human viral pathogen identified using four distinct oligonucleotide probes corresponding to three HSV-2 genes associated with different stages of viral infection. Although the effects from immunosuppressive therapy on viral gene expression remain unclear, this exploratory study suggests a new approach to evaluate shared viral agents and antiviral immune responses that may be involved in the development of SAID.",

    "abstract": "Many observational studies have shown a protective effect of physical activity on cognitive ageing, but interventional studies have been less convincing. This may be due to short time scales of interventions, suboptimal interventional regimes or lack of lasting effect. Confounding through common genetic and developmental causes is also possible.\nWe aimed to test whether muscle fitness (measured by leg power) could predict cognitive change in a healthy older population over a 10-year time interval, how this performed alongside other predictors of cognitive ageing, and whether this effect was confounded by factors shared by twins. In addition, we investigated whether differences in leg power were predictive of differences in brain structure and function after 12 years of follow-up in identical twin pairs.\nA total of 324 healthy female twins (average age at baseline 55, range 43-73) performed the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) at two time points 10 years apart. Linear regression modelling was used to assess the relationships between baseline leg power, physical activity and subsequent cognitive change, adjusting comprehensively for baseline covariates (including heart disease, diabetes, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, lipids, diet, body habitus, smoking and alcohol habits, reading IQ, socioeconomic status and birthweight). A discordant twin approach was used to adjust for factors shared by twins. A subset of monozygotic pairs then underwent magnetic resonance imaging. The relationship between muscle fitness and brain structure and function was assessed using linear regression modelling and paired t tests.\nA striking protective relationship was found between muscle fitness (leg power) and both 10-year cognitive change [fully adjusted model standardised \u03b2-coefficient (Std\u03b2) = 0.174, p = 0.002] and subsequent total grey matter (Std\u03b2 = 0.362, p = 0.005). These effects were robust in discordant twin analyses, where within-pair difference in physical fitness was also predictive of within-pair difference in lateral ventricle size. There was a weak independent effect of self-reported physical activity.\nLeg power predicts both cognitive ageing and global brain structure, despite controlling for common genetics and early life environment shared by twins. Interventions targeted to improve leg power in the long term may help reach a universal goal of healthy cognitive ageing.",

    "abstract": "Recent observations of planar defects in boron carbide have been shown to deviate from perfect mirror symmetry and are referred to as \"asymmetric twins.\" Here, we demonstrate that these asymmetric twins are really phase boundaries that form in stoichiometric B(4)C (i.e., B(12)C(3)) but not in B(13)C(2). TEM observations and ab initio simulations have been coupled to show that these planar defects result from an interplay of stoichiometry, atomic positioning, icosahedral twinning, and structural hierarchy. The composition of icosahedra in B(4)C is B(11)C and translation of the carbon atom from a polar to equatorial site leads to a shift in bonding and a slight distortion of the lattice. No such distortion is observed in boron-rich B(13)C(2) because the icosahedra do not contain carbon. Implications for tailoring boron carbide with stoichiometry and extrapolations to other hierarchical crystalline materials are discussed.",

    "abstract": "We studied schizophrenia liability in a Danish population-based sample of 44 twin pairs (13 MZ, 31 DZ, SS plus OS) in order to replicate previous twin study findings using contemporary diagnostic criteria, to examine genetic liability shared between schizophrenia and other disorders, and to explore whether variance in schizophrenia liability attributable to environmental factors may have decreased with successive cohorts exposed to improvements in public health. ICD-10 diagnoses were determined by clinical interview. Although the best-fitting, most parsimonious biometric model of schizophrenia liability specified variance attributable to additive genetic and non-shared environmental factors, this model did not differ significantly from a model that also included non-additive genetic factors, consistent with recent interview-based twin studies. Schizophrenia showed strong genetic links to other psychotic disorders but much less so for the broader category of psychiatric disorders in general. We also observed a marginally significant decline in schizophrenia variance attributable to environmental factors over successive Western European cohorts, consistent perhaps with improvements in diagnosis and in prenatal and perinatal care and with a secular decline in the prevalence of schizophrenia in that region.",

    "abstract": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by a high level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. We report 4-year-old dichorionic diamniotic twins (boy and girl) with FH who presented with multiple xanthomas on the face, both knees, both feet, and buttocks. Family history revealed vertical transmission of hypercholesterolemia from father to patients, thereby suggesting dominant inheritance. Lipid data of their mother did not match the criteria of FH. However, lipid data of maternal grandmother and maternal sister matched the criteria of FH. LDL receptor gene analysis of the family revealed that their father was heterozygous for a missense mutation, L547V, their mother was heterozygous for a nonsense mutation, C675X, and patients were compound heterozygous for L547V and C675X. After 10 months of treatment with pitavastatin (2 mg/day) and ezetimibe (10 mg/day), LDL-C decreased from 595 mg/dL to 267 mg/dL in the boy and from 530 mg/dL to 182 mg/dL in the girl. These findings suggest that lipid-lowering therapy with statin may be considered in pediatric patients with compound heterozygous FH (hetero FH) before inducing LDL apheresis, and gene analysis for true diagnosis in pediatric patients with multiple xanthomas should be considered, though they appear to be hetero FH from the family history and lipid data of parents.",

    "abstract": "To determine genetic and environmental impact on mandibular morphology using lateral cephalometric analysis of twins with completed mandibular growth and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) based zygosity determination.\nThe 39 cephalometric variables of 141 same gender adult pair of twins were analysed. Zygosity was determined using 15 specific DNA markers and cervical vertebral maturation method was used to assess completion of the mandibular growth. A genetic analysis was performed using maximum likelihood genetic structural equation modelling (GSEM).\nThe genetic heritability estimates of angular variables describing horizontal mandibular position in relationship to cranial base and maxilla were considerably higher than in those describing vertical position. The mandibular skeletal cephalometric variables also showed high heritability estimates with angular measurements being considerably higher than linear ones. Results of this study indicate that the angular measurements representing mandibular skeletal morphology (mandibular form) have greater genetic determination than the linear measurements (mandibular size).\nThe shape and sagittal position of the mandible is under stronger genetic control, than is its size and vertical relationship to cranial base.",

    "abstract": "Identification of individuals within pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins remains unresolved using common forensic DNA typing technology. For some criminal cases involving MZ twins as suspects, the twins had to be released due to inability to identify which of the pair was the perpetrator. In this study, we performed a genome-wide scan on whole blood-derived DNA from four pairs of healthy phenotypically concordant MZ twins using the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing technology to identify candidate DNA methylation markers with capacity to distinguish MZ twins within a pair. We identified 38 differential methylation regions showing within-pair methylation differences in all four MZ pairs. These are all located in CpG islands, 17 of which are promoter-associated, 17 are intergenic islands, and four are intragenic islands. Genes associated with these markers are related with cell proliferation, differentiation, and growth and development, including zinc finger proteins, PRRX2, RBBP9, or are involved in G-protein signaling, such as the regulator of G-protein signaling 16. Further validation studies on additional MZ twins are now required to evaluate the broader utility of these 38 markers for forensic use.",

    "abstract": "Introduction\u2003This report will discuss a case of minimally conjoined omphalopagus twins (MCOTs) with a body stalk anomaly (BSA). Case Report\u2003We experienced monochorionic diamniotic (MD) twins born at 31 weeks. One infant was suspicious of BSA before birth, and another infant was normal. But normal infant had anal atresia with small intestine which was inserted behind the umbilicus. Twins had very short common umbilicus and infant with BSA had intestinal conjunction, two appendixes at the site of the colon, and a blind-ending colon. We diagnosed MCOTs. Discussion\u2003On the basis of the Spencer hypothesis, the etiology of MCOTs was that MD twins shared a yolk sac. However, this could not explain the presence of a BSA. It is necessary to consider the possible reasons for a singleton BSA. In addition, intestinal fusion occurred unequally in this case, although two appendixes were found in the same place, which might have occurred because of the balanced fusion.",

    "abstract": "The heritability of coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden, coronary geometry, and phenotypes associated with increased cardiometabolic risk are largely unknown. The primary aim of the Burden of Atherosclerotic Plaques Study in Twins-Genetic Loci and the Burden of Atherosclerotic Lesions (BUDAPEST-GLOBAL) study is to evaluate the influence of genetic and environmental factors on the burden of coronary artery disease. By design this is a prospective, single-center, classical twin study. In total, 202 twins (61 monozygotic pairs, 40 dizygotic same-sex pairs) were enrolled from the Hungarian Twin Registry database. All twins underwent non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) for the detection and quantification of coronary artery calcium and for the measurement of epicardial fat volumes. In addition, a single non-contrast-enhanced image slice was acquired at the level of L3-L4 to assess abdominal fat distribution. Coronary CT angiography was used for the detection and quantification of plaque, stenosis, and overall coronary artery disease burden. For the primary analysis, we will assess the presence and volume of atherosclerotic plaques. Furthermore, the 3-dimensional coronary geometry will be assessed based on the coronary CT angiography datasets. Additional phenotypic analyses will include per-patient epicardial and abdominal fat quantity measurements. Measurements obtained from monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs will be compared to evaluate the genetic or environmental effects of the given phenotype. The BUDAPEST-GLOBAL study provides a unique framework to shed some light on the genetic and environmental influences of cardiometabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Age and peripheral microcirculation disorders are the main causes of rotator cuff degeneration. Acromion variants may affect subacromial space width, causing a pathological narrowing of the space that may compromise the cuff integrity. However, it is not clear if the subacromial space width is genetically determined or if it changes according to loading conditions. To clarify this unresolved question, we performed an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) study with the aim of evaluating the acromiohumeral distance in a group of elderly monozygotic and dizygotic twins, and we analyzed the obtained data using the twin design to separate the contributions of shared and unique environments.\nWe identified twenty-nine pairs of elderly twins. On MRI scans, we evaluated the acromiohumeral distance and health status of the rotator cuff tendons. Heritability, defined as the proportion of total variance of a specific characteristic in a particular population due to a genetic cause, was estimated as twice the difference between the intraclass correlation coefficients for monozygotic and dizygotic pairs. The influence of shared environment, due to environmental factors that contribute to twin and sibling similarity, was calculated as the difference between the monozygotic correlation coefficient and the heritability index. One-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) was used to estimate the differences among job categories, both in the total cohort and within zygosity groups.\nThe intraclass correlation coefficient was substantially higher for monozygotic than for dizygotic twins, indicating a high degree of concordance of the acromiohumeral distance in pairs of individuals who shared 100% of their genes. The heritability index was 0.82, and shared and unique environmental contributions were both 0.09. There were no significant differences among subjects in different job categories, either in the total cohort (p = 0.685) or within the monozygotic (p = 0.719) and dizygotic groups (p = 0.957).\nThe acromiohumeral distance is mainly genetically determined and only marginally influenced by external factors.",

    "abstract": "Our aims were to study the effect of birthweight growth discordance (\u226520%) on neuro-developmental outcome of monochorionic and dichorionic twins and to compare the relative effects of foetal growth discordance and prematurity on cognitive outcome. We performed a cross-sectional multicentre prospective follow-up study from a cohort of 948 twin pregnancies. One hundred nineteen birthweight-discordant twin pairs were examined (24 monochorionic pairs) and were matched for gestational age at delivery with 111 concordant control pairs. Participants were assessed with the Bayley Scales between 24 and 42 months of age. Analysis was by paired t test for intra-twin pair differences and by multiple linear regression. Compared to the larger twin of a discordant pair, the smaller twin performed significantly worse in cognition (mean composite cognitive score difference\u2009=\u2009-1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20090.3-3.1, p\u2009=\u20090.01) and also in language and motor skills. Prematurity prior to 33 weeks' gestation, however, had a far greater impact on cognitive outcomes (mean cognitive composite score difference\u2009=\u2009-5.8, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.2-10.5, p\u2009=\u20090.008).\nBirthweight growth discordance of \u226520% confers an independent adverse effect on long-term neuro-development of the smaller twin. However, prior to 33 weeks' gestation, gestational age at birth adversely affects cognitive development to a greater extent than foetal growth discordance.",

    "abstract": "Childhood psychotic symptoms are associated with increased rates of schizophrenia, other psychiatric disorders, and suicide attempts in adulthood; thus, elucidating early risk indicators is crucial to target prevention efforts. There is considerable discordance for psychotic symptoms between monozygotic twins, indicating that child-specific non-genetic factors must be involved. Epigenetic processes may constitute one of these factors and have not yet been investigated in relation to childhood psychotic symptoms. Therefore, this study explored whether differences in DNA methylation at age 10 were associated with monozygotic twin discordance for psychotic symptoms at age 12. The Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study cohort of 2,232 children (1,116 twin pairs) was assessed for age-12 psychotic symptoms and 24 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for symptoms were identified for methylomic comparison. Children provided buccal samples at ages 5 and 10. DNA was bisulfite modified and DNA methylation was quantified using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 array. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with psychotic symptoms were subsequently tested in post-mortem prefrontal cortex tissue from adult schizophrenia patients and age-matched controls. Site-specific DNA methylation differences were observed at age 10 between monozygotic twins discordant for age-12 psychotic symptoms. Similar DMPs were not found at age 5. The top-ranked psychosis-associated DMP (cg23933044), located in the promoter of the C5ORF42 gene, was also hypomethylated in post-mortem prefrontal cortex brain tissue from schizophrenia patients compared to unaffected controls. These data tentatively suggest that epigenetic variation in peripheral tissue is associated with childhood psychotic symptoms and may indicate susceptibility to schizophrenia and other mental health problems.",

    "abstract": "The study of twin behavior offers the opportunity to study differential patterns of social and communicative interactions in a context where the adult partner and same-age peer are equally familiar. We investigated the development of social engagement, communicative gestures, and imitation in 7- to 25-month-old twins. Twin dyads (N=20 pairs) participated in 10-min, semi-structured play sessions, with the mother seated in a chair completing paperwork for half the session, and on the floor with her children for the other half. Overall, twins engaged more with their mothers than with their siblings: they showed objects and imitated speech and object use more frequently when interacting with their mothers than with their siblings. When the mother was otherwise engaged, the twins played with toys separately, observed each other's toy play, or were unengaged. These results demonstrate that adult scaffolding of social interactions supports increased communicative bids even in a context where both familiar peers and adults are available as communicative partners.",

    "abstract": "Alagille syndrome is a multisystem developmental disorder characterized by bile duct paucity, congenital heart disease, vertebral anomalies, posterior embryotoxon, and characteristic facial features. Alagille syndrome is typically the result of germline mutations in JAG1 or NOTCH2 and is one of several human diseases caused by Notch signaling abnormalities. A wide phenotypic spectrum has been well documented in Alagille syndrome. Therefore, monozygotic twins with Alagille syndrome provide a unique opportunity to evaluate potential phenotypic modifiers such as environmental factors or stochastic effects of gene expression. In this report, we describe an Alagille syndrome monozygotic twin pair with discordant placental and clinical findings. We propose that environmental factors such as prenatal hypoxia may have played a role in determining the phenotypic severity.",

We have described how the U.S. Neonatal Resuscitation Program algorithm can be modified for delivery room resuscitation of omphaloischiopagus conjoined twins. In planning for the delivery and resuscitation of these patients, we considered the challenges of providing cardiopulmonary support to preterm conjoined twins in face-to-face orientation and with shared circulation via a fused liver and single umbilical cord. We also demonstrate how in situ simulation can be used to prepare a large, multidisciplinary team of health care professionals to deliver safe, efficient, and effective care to such patients.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period may imply morbidity leading to work incapacity; however, this is seldom studied. This study aimed to compare twin sisters giving or not giving birth regarding occurrence of sickness absence (SA) and disability pension (DP).\nThis population-based cohort study included all 6323 female twins born in Sweden 1959-1990, using register data for 1994-2010 about SA and DP. Average number of SA/DP days/year was calculated in relation to the year of the first delivery, or, if not giving birth, the year when the twin sister gave birth. Twin pairs discordant for delivery were used to investigate the importance of genetic and environmental factors for occurrence of SA and DP.\nIn all, 52% had a first delivery during 1994-2010. Except for the year of delivery, the average number of SA days/year was similar when comparing women who gave birth to those who did not, while number of DP days was significantly higher in women who did not give birth. Differences between the groups seem attributable to genetic factors. Women who delivered once had higher levels of SA and DP than those who had several deliveries. DP with mental diagnoses was more common among women who had not delivered whereas DP with musculoskeletal diagnoses occurred more often among women who delivered.\nLevels of SA were similar among women who gave birth and who did not. Women not giving birth had significantly higher levels of DP, indicating health selections into childbirth.",

Except for the year of delivery, the average number of SA days/year was similar when comparing women who gave birth to those who did not, while number of DP days was significantly higher in women who did not give birth. Differences between the groups seem attributable to genetic factors. Women who delivered once had higher levels of SA and DP than those who had several deliveries. DP with mental diagnoses was more common among women who had not delivered whereas DP with musculoskeletal diagnoses occurred more often among women who delivered.",

    "abstract": "Birthweight remains one of the strongest predictors of perinatal mortality and disability. Birthweight percentiles form a reference that allows the detection of neonates at higher risk of neonatal and postneonatal morbidity. The aim of the study is to present updated national birthweight percentiles by gestational age for male and female twins born in Australia.\nPopulation data were extracted from the Australian National Perinatal Data Collection for twins born in Australia between 2001 and 2010. A total of 43,833 women gave birth to 87,666 twins in Australia which were included in the study analysis. Implausible birthweights were excluded using Tukey's methodology based on the interquartile range. Univariate analysis was used to examine the birthweight percentiles for liveborn twins born between 20 and 42 weeks gestation.\nBirthweight percentiles by gestational age were calculated for 85,925 live births (43,153 males and 42,706 females). Of these infants, 53.6% were born preterm (birth before 37 completed weeks of gestation) while 50.2% were low birthweight (<2500 g) and 8.7% were very low birthweight (<1500 g). The mean birthweight decreased from 2462 g in 2001 to 2440 g in 2010 for male twins, compared with 2485 g in 1991-94. For female twins, the mean birthweight decreased from 2375 g in 2001 to 2338 g in 2010, compared with 2382 g in 1991-94.\nThe birthweight percentiles provide clinicians and researchers with up-to-date population norms of birthweight percentiles for twins in Australia.",

    "abstract": "Silica (SiO2) is one of the most common materials on Earth. The crystalline form \u03b1-quartz is the stable silica polymorph at ambient conditions although metastable forms exist. \u03b1-quartz is a piezoelectric material, it can be produced artificially and is widely used for example in electronics and the biosciences. Despite the many application areas, the atomic surface structures of silica polymorphs are neither well understood nor well characterized. Here we present measurements of \u03b1-quartz (0001). Helium Atom Scattering combined with Atomic Force Microscopy reveals a giant reconstruction consisting of 5.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\u2009nm wide ribbons, oriented 10.4\u00b0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u00b0 relative to the bulk unit cell. The ribbons, with the aid of atomistic modelling, can be explained as a self-organised pattern of nano Dauphine twins (nano electrical twins).",

Perinatal outcomes are described and then compared according to mode of delivery for patients who gave birth at or after 32 weeks of gestation.\nThree of the 38 pregnancies included fetal malformations; in two of these cases, both fetuses died in utero at 26 weeks of gestation. In cases without malformations, one twin died in utero in two women at 28.0 and 29.2 weeks of gestation, and both fetuses died in two other women at 24.0 and 24.5 weeks of gestation. Mean gestational age at delivery was 32.9 weeks (range 24.0-36.3). Five women gave birth between 22 and 26 weeks of gestation, six women gave birth between 27 and 31 weeks of gestation, and 27 women gave birth at or after 32 weeks of gestation (26 after excluding those with fetal malformations). No intrauterine or neonatal deaths were observed at or after 32 weeks of gestation. The 28 infants delivered vaginally did not differ significantly from the 22 infants born by caesarean section in terms of umbilical artery pH or 5-min Apgar scores.\nContinuation of monoamniotic pregnancies beyond 32 weeks of gestation and trial of vaginal delivery are both reasonable options if the parents agree, and optimal surveillance is provided.",

On days 20 and 22, a single embryonic proper with a heartbeat was observed. On day 29, two embryos proper appeared during ultrasound examination, each possessing a heartbeat. Subsequent examinations on days 35 and 39 revealed continued viability and development of both embryos proper. On day 49, demise of both fetuses was present. Although no DNA analysis or post-partum examinations were performed, it is presumed that the fetuses were monozygotic twins based on membrane classification by ultrasound imaging as well as development occurring after the transfer of a single in vitro-produced embryo.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to verify the influence of a genetic factor on the etiology of oral bony outgrowths and to determine the prevalence and type of oral bony outgrowths (tori and exostoses) among a group of Lithuanian twins.\nIn total, 162 twins (81 twin pairs) were analyzed for the presence or absence, type, and size of oral bony outgrowths. Statistical analysis was carried out to find the prevalence of bony protuberances and the relationship between zygosity and occurrence of oral bony enlargements. Zygosity of twins was confirmed by DNA analysis.\n59.9% of the subjects had oral bony outgrowths. Mandibular tori were found in 56.8% and palatal tori in 1.8% of the sample.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To explore the mechanism and diagnostic method for monochorionic-diamniotic twins discordant for karyotype analysis. METHODS Dual amniocentesis was performed on five pairs of monochorionic-diamniotic twins, which all consisted of a normal twin and one with multiple malformations revealed by ultrasound. Karyotype analysis was performed on amniocytes derived from each of the twins. Zygosity was also determined with DNA extracted from amniocytes with 16 polymorphic microsatellite markers. RESULTS Three cases of 45,X, one case of 47,XX,+9 and one case of 47,XY,+18 were detected among the abnormal twins, while the normal fetuses all had a normal karyotype. DNA analysis suggested that, in all cases, the twins have shared the 16 polymorphic microsatellite markers, which confirmed their monozygosity. CONCLUSION Monochorionic-diamniotic twins may be discordant for karyotyping, for which anaphase lagging, chromosomal non-disjunction and trisomy rescue may be the underlying reasons. As a simple method, dual amniocentesis can be used to obtain amniotic fluid samples for karyotype analysis and determination of zygosity for such twins.",

    "abstract": "One important task in translational cancer research is the search for new prognostic biomarkers to improve survival prognosis for patients. The use of high-throughput technologies allows simultaneous measurement of genome-wide gene expression or other genomic data for all patients in a clinical trial. Penalized likelihood methods such as lasso regression can be applied to such high-dimensional data, where the number of (genomic) covariables is usually much larger than the sample size. There is a connection between the lasso and the Bayesian regression model with independent Laplace priors on the regression parameters, and understanding this connection has been useful for understanding the properties of lasso estimates in linear models (e.g. Park and Casella, 2008). In this paper, we study the lasso in the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks in the context of Cox models. For the Bayesian lasso we extend the approach by Lee et al. (2011). In particular, we impose the lasso penalty only on the genome features, but not on relevant clinical covariates, to allow the mandatory inclusion of important established factors. We investigate the models in high- and low-dimensional simulation settings and in an application to chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",

    "abstract": "The unique intrauterine environment has been proposed to put twins at increased risk of certain cancers compared to singletons, still large population comparisons have generally indicated lower risks in twins. To improve the understanding of potential twin influence on cancer we compared twins to their singletons siblings, to target a unique twinning influence. Singletons from twin families were contrasted to singletons from non-twin families to further capture potential twin family influence on risk of cancer. Family relations were identified using the Swedish Multi-Generation Register. Among individuals born between 1932 and 1958, 49,156 twins and N\u2009=\u200935,227 singletons were identified from 18,098 unique twin families. All incident cases of specific cancer types were identified in the National Cancer Register up to the end of 2007. Standardized survival functions were estimated using weighted Cox proportional hazard regression and the corresponding cumulative risks plotted against age. Overall, primary cancers were identified in 9% and 18% of all male and female twins, compared to 11% and 19% of their male and female singleton siblings. When specific cancer sites were compared using standardized cumulative risk plots, no consistent statistically significant differences were noted either between twins and singletons of twin families or between singletons of twin and non-twin families. Despite a different intrauterine experience, twinning does not seem to have any greater negative influence on life-time risks of cancer. The findings also indicate that twin family membership has no substantial influence on cancer risks.",

Genetic analysis of these networks may help identify processes giving rise to heritable brain disorders, but we do not yet know which network measures are promising for genetic analyses. Many factors affect the downstream results, such as the tractography algorithm used to define structural connectivity. We tested nine different tractography algorithms and four normalization methods to compute brain networks for 853 young healthy adults (twins and their siblings). We fitted genetic structural equation models to all nine network measures, after a normalization step to increase network consistency across tractography algorithms. Probabilistic tractography algorithms with global optimization (such as Probtrackx and Hough) yielded higher heritability statistics than \"greedy\" algorithms (such as FACT) which process small neighborhoods at each step. Some global network measures (probtrackx-derived GLOB and ST) showed significant genetic effects, making them attractive targets for genome-wide association studies.",

    "abstract": "To examine the relative risk (RR) of congenital heart disease (CHD) in twins compared with singletons, according to chorionicity.\nTwins and singletons with CHD notified to the Northern Congenital Abnormality Survey between 1998 and 2010 were included in this population-based study. Information on chorionicity was obtained from the Northern Survey of Twins and Multiple Pregnancy. Prevalence was calculated as the number of cases occurring in live births, late miscarriages (20-23 weeks), stillbirths (\u226524\u2005weeks) and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly, per 10\u2005000 total births. The risk of CHD in twins compared with singletons was estimated using Poisson regression.\nThere were 399\u2005414 singleton births of which 2984 (0.7%) had CHD. Among 11\u2005871 twin births, 154 (1.3%) had CHD; one twin was affected by CHD in 2.5% of twin pregnancies. Of 8605 dichorionic (DC) births and 2317 monochorionic (MC) births, 96 (1.1%) and 47 (2.0%) were associated with CHD. Compared with singletons, twins were at significantly increased risk of CHD (RR=1.73, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.04; p<0.001). MC twins were at 82% significantly increased risk of CHD compared with DC twins (RR=1.82, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.57; p<0.001). The RR of severe and mild CHD was particularly high in MC twins compared with singletons (292% increased risk, RR=3.92, 95% CI 1.25 to 12.30, p=0.02 and 207% increased risk, RR=3.07, 95% CI 2.20 to 4.28; p<0.001).\nCompared with singletons, twins were at increased risk of CHD, the risk being substantially higher among MC twins. This information is important for health professionals when counselling women with twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "There are three types of monozygotic (MZ) twins. MZ twins can either share one chorion and one amnion, each twin can have its own amnion, or MZ twins can-like dizygotic twins-each have their own chorion and amnion. Sharing the same chorion may create a more similar/dissimilar prenatal environment and bias heritability estimates, but most twin studies do not distinguish between these three types of MZ twin pairs. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of chorion sharing on the similarity within MZ twin pairs for a large number of traits. Information on chorion status was obtained for the Netherlands twin register (NTR) by linkage to the records from the database of the dutch pathological anatomy national automated archive (PALGA). Record linkage was successful for over 9000 pairs. Effect of chorion type was tested by comparing the within-pair similarity between monochorionic (MC) and dichorionic (DC) MZ twins on 66 traits including weight, height, motor milestones, child problem behaviors, cognitive function, wellbeing and personality. For only 10 traits, within-pair similarity differed between MCMZ and DCMZ pairs. For traits influenced by birth weight (e.g. weight and height in young children) we expected that MC twins would be more discordant. This was found for 5 out of 13 measures. When looking at traits where blood supply is important, we saw MCMZ twins to be more concordant than DCMZ's for 3 traits. We conclude that the influence on the MZ twin correlation of the intra-uterine prenatal environment, as measured by sharing a chorion type, is small and limited to a few phenotypes. This implies that the assumption of equal prenatal environment of mono- and DC MZ twins, which characterizes the classical twin design, is largely tenable.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the degree of mixed-handedness in predominantly right-handed Vietnam combat veteran twins and their identical, combat-unexposed cotwins. The \"high-risk\" cotwins of combat veterans with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) had more mixed-handedness (i.e., less right-handedness) than the \"low-risk\" cotwins of combat veterans without PTSD. Self-reported combat exposure in combat-exposed twins was a mediator of the association between handedness in their unexposed cotwins and PTSD in the twins themselves. We conclude that mixed-handedness is a familial risk factor for combat-related PTSD. This risk may be mediated in part by a proclivity for mixed-handed soldiers and Marines to experience heavier combat.",

    "abstract": "Homeopathy claims a curative reaction from small doses of a substance, high doses of which cause symptoms similar to those the patient is suffering from. Hormesis is a concept of biphasic dose-response to different pharmacological and toxicological agents. According to this concept, a small dose of a noxious agent can exert a beneficial action. A hypothesis is defended here that hormesis as a general principle can be assumed only for the factors present in the natural environment thus having induced adaptation of living organisms. Generalizations of the hormesis phenomenon used in support of homeopathy are unfounded. Low-dose impacts may be associated with a higher risk in a state of organ sub-compensation or failure especially in the elderly patients. Practical recommendations should be based neither on the hormesis as a default approach nor on the postulates of homeopathy. All clinically relevant effects, hormetic or not, should be tested by the methods of evidence-based medicine.",

    "abstract": "In dealing with conjoined twins, we have adopted a pragmatic approach in balancing what is possible, parental wishes and the likely outcome for the children. We believe that separation where feasible should be undertaken but appreciate that a few parents may wish their children to remain joined. The advice that we give balances the very real risks of surgery against the type of life the twins will experience if they remain joined. In some types of union such as end to end ischiopagus, the twins will never stand and will be bedridden. With other types of union, independent walking is not possible. Such limitations on living seem intolerable to us, but we have left the final decision to parents.",

We have dealt with 2 such sets and illustrate our approach by reference to our most recent set.

When venous drainage from the 2 brains is connected, we believe that staged separation is preferable as gradual alteration of hemodynamics may be safer than a single-stage procedure.",

Outcomes after surgical separation of thoracic level conjoined twins have been favorable when the hearts have been separate. However, even in this situation, the outlook is poor for an individual twin with an important cardiac defect. Arterial anastomosis between twin circulations is an important additional consideration, with poor outcomes for perfusion recipient twins. Surgical separation is contraindicated when ventricular level cardiac fusion exists. Cardiac assessment is a key component of prenatal counseling.",

Technical advances in imaging such as high-resolution isovolumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and three-dimensional modeling now result in extremely accurate anatomical information. Varied information from a comprehensive radiological work-up enables the surgeons to plan the safest possible operative procedure, helps the anesthetic team before and during surgery, and guides the intensive care team in the post-operative phase. This article will review the radiological techniques used in our institution, highlighting potential pitfalls with the various imaging modalities.",

Gray matter changes were assessed with magnetic resonance images using voxel-based morphometry with statistical parametric mapping.\nIn the affected twins, the peaks of volume loss were located bilaterally in the temporal (including the hippocampus), the frontal, and the parietal lobes, while in the unaffected siblings, the peaks were located in the frontal gyri and in the parietal lobule. Thus, in the unaffected twins, the pattern of volume loss overlaps with the neocortical but not with the medial temporal areas.\nThese findings suggest that genetic factors more largely control neocortical regions, whereas environmental factors more strongly affect medial temporal regions.",

    "abstract": "Vasa previa is a condition in which one or more fetal blood vessels run through the amniotic membranes and cross or run near the external orifice of the uterus. Rupture of membranes can lead to tearing of these vessels and cause acute fetal exsanguination. In monochorionic twin (MC) pregnancies, acute exsanguination in one twin can lead to severe complications in the co-twin due to the presence of inter-twin placental vascular connections. We report a MC pair with severe perinatal asphyxia due to acute exsanguination after prenatally undetected ruptured vasa previa. This resulted in severe hemorrhagic shock in both twins with double fatal outcome. Antenatal detection of vasa previa is of paramount importance to prevent severe morbidity and mortality, especially in MCs. A review of the literature is presented.",

    "abstract": "Twins living in different countries offer opportunities to explore associations between observed differences and experiential effects. This report compared the life histories, cognitive abilities, personality traits, psychomotor skills, medical characteristics, job satisfaction, social support and social relations of dizygotic (DZ) female twins reunited at 78, the world's longest separated set. The twins' advanced age also enabled a study of how co-twin differences in aging may be associated with current behavioral and social differences. Consistent with previous studies, these dizygotic reared apart (DZA) twins showed discordance across some, but not all, traits. Their different rearing situations and life histories may explain current differences in their responses to meeting their twin. This case highlights the importance of both genetic and rearing factors on behavior, but does not allow firm conclusions regarding the extent to which these sources explain individual developmental differences. However, such data contribute to the growing number of cross-culturally separated twins, generating novel hypotheses that may be assessed using larger samples.",

    "abstract": "Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonates (birth weight <10th centile) are at higher risk of altered glucose homeostasis compared to appropriate for gestational age (AGA) neonates. The aim of this matched case-control study was to estimate the incidence of hypoglycaemia and/or hyperglycaemia in monochorionic (MC) twins with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR).\nWe included all MC twins with sIUGR (2002-2013). Neonates in the SGA group were matched with their AGA co-twin. We recorded the occurrence of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia in the first 48\u2009h after birth and studied the association with SGA.\nIn this retrospective study were 126 twin pairs included. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the SGA group and AGA group was 29.6% and 17.4%, respectively, hyperglycaemia occurred in 8.7% of the SGA neonates and in 2.6% of the AGA co-twins. Multivariate analysis showed an independent association of SGA with hypoglycaemia (OR 1.97, CI 1.23-3.18, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01), but not with hyperglycaemia (OR 2.57, CI 1.64-10.28, p\u2009=\u20090.182). Low gestational age (GA) at birth (OR 1.65, CI 1.09-2.48, p\u2009=\u20090.02) showed an independent association with hyperglycaemia.\nThe risk of hypoglycaemia is almost twofold higher in SGA neonates compared to their MC AGA twins. Low GA appeared to be an independent risk factor for hyperglycaemia in SGA neonates.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality primarily due to spontaneous preterm deliveries. The mean gestational age for delivery is 35.3 weeks and twins account for 23% of preterm births <32 weeks. A number of strategies have been proposed to prevent preterm deliveries: tocolytics, bed rest, hospitalization, home uterine activity monitoring, cerclage, and most recently, progesterone. Unfortunately, none have proven effective. Recent metaanalyses and reviews suggest that transvaginal cervical length (TVCL) ultrasound in the second trimester is a powerful predictor of preterm birth among asymptomatic women. Indeed, TVCL has the highest positive and negative predictive values for determining the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery in twin pregnancies. It follows that TVCL assessment may allow identification of a subset of twin pregnancies that re better candidates for interventions intended to prevent prematurity.\nWe sought to determine whether use of TVCL prolongs gestation in twin pregnancies.\nThis is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of 125 dichorionic or monochorionic/diamniotic twin pregnancies without prior preterm birth <28 weeks. The study group (n = 63) had TVCL and digital exams monthly from 16-28 weeks and were managed with a standard algorithm for activity restriction and cerclage. The control group (n = 62) had monthly digital cervical examinations but no routine TVCL ultrasound examinations. The primary outcome was gestational age at delivery. Secondary outcomes included percentage of deliveries <35 weeks, and maternal and neonatal outcomes.\nThe mean gestational age at delivery was 35.7 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 35.2-36.2) among those managed with TVCL and 35.5 weeks (95% CI, 34.7-36.4) among the control patients. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of deliveries <38 weeks were not significantly different between groups. This was true whether we compared curves with a log-rank test (P = .67), Breslow test (P = .67), or Tarone-Ware test (P = .64). The percentage of deliveries <35 0/7 weeks did not differ: 27.4% for subjects managed with routine TVCL and 28.6% for control subjects (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.60-1.54). Our study had an 80% power to detect a 12-day difference in the gestational age at delivery with 95% confidence.\nThe overall mean length of gestation and the percentage of women delivering <35 weeks did not differ between twin gestations managed with TVCL and digital exams monthly from 16-28 weeks with a standard algorithm for activity restriction and cerclage and controls who had monthly digital cervical examinations but no routine TVCL. Routine second-trimester transvaginal ultrasound assessment of cervical length is not associated with improved outcomes when incorporated into the standard management of otherwise low-risk twin pregnancies.",

Opposite-sex twin girls did not have higher androgens in cord blood compared with same-sex twin girls. Boys of an opposite-sex twin had lower luteinizing hormone concentrations compared with dizygotic twin boys with a brother as a co-twin.\nChildren from a twin are not overexposed to sex steroids at the time of birth, despite higher concentrations in their mothers, and girls from opposite sex twins do not show androgenic influences from their male co-twin.

Our objective, in the modern setting with twins of known chorionicity, was to compare maternal and neonatal outcomes of twin pregnancies before and after commencement of a consultant-led, multidisciplinary twins clinic (TC).\nRetrospective cohort study of 513 women, with birth of twins at \u226520 weeks' gestation, January 2007 to November 2011, at a metropolitan tertiary maternity hospital, Sydney, Australia. Demographic, pregnancy, and outcome data were obtained from hospital databases. Women receiving TC care (2009-2011) were compared to those receiving general antenatal clinic (ANC) care (2007-2010) and private care (2009-2011). Other models of care were excluded. Main outcome measures were total maternal inpatient stay, mode of birth, gestational age at birth, and neonatal nursery admission.\n286 women were included in the main analyses: 84 attended ANC, 101 TC, and 101 a private obstetrician. TC women had similar demographics to ANC women and were slightly younger than private patients. TC women had lower Caesarean section rates (55% vs. 70% ANC and 76% private, p\u2009=\u20090.008) and fewer late preterm (34\u2009+\u20090-36\u2009+\u20096 weeks) births, (26%TC vs. 44% ANC and 41% private, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Median maternal inpatient stay was shorter in TC than ANC (7 vs. 8 days, p\u2009=\u20090.009) and similar to private (7 days). Nursery admission rates were higher in private patients (67% vs. 49% ANC and 47% TC, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and average birthweight lower (2283 g vs. 2501 g ANC and 2496 g TC, p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nWithin a single centre, maternal and neonatal twin pregnancy outcomes varied significantly by model of care. Introducing a specialised twins clinic in our setting decreased Caesarean section rates, late preterm birth, and inpatient stay compared to ANC.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies generally represent a high-risk pregnancy. However, monozygous twins are real challenges for obstetricians due to the complications that may occur. Among the particular cases of monozygous twins in the University Emergency Hospital of Bucharest, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, a monochorial monoamniotic pregnancy with conjoined twins has been described. These particular medical circumstances require a deeper understanding of the vascular anatomical particularities. An accurate diagnosis implies a most detailed description of the morphological dynamics of the fetuses with the study of the impact of the vascular anomaly on their development so that the maximum chances of survival and the best outcome for the viable fetus can be obtained. The diagnosis of the most frequently associated anomalies is also extremely important.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial component of the human gut microbiota undergoes a definable program of postnatal development. Evidence is accumulating that this program is disrupted in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and that their persistent gut microbiota immaturity, which is not durably repaired with current ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) interventions, is causally related to disease pathogenesis. To further characterize gut microbial community development in healthy versus malnourished infants/children, we performed a time-series metagenomic study of DNA isolated from virus-like particles (VLPs) recovered from fecal samples collected during the first 30 mo of postnatal life from eight pairs of mono- and dizygotic Malawian twins concordant for healthy growth and 12 twin pairs discordant for SAM. Both members of discordant pairs were sampled just before, during, and after treatment with a peanut-based RUTF. Using Random Forests and a dataset of 17,676 viral contigs assembled from shotgun sequencing reads of VLP DNAs, we identified viruses that distinguish different stages in the assembly of the gut microbiota in the concordant healthy twin pairs. This developmental program is impaired in both members of SAM discordant pairs and not repaired with RUTF. Phage plus members of the Anelloviridae and Circoviridae families of eukaryotic viruses discriminate discordant from concordant healthy pairs. These results disclose that apparently healthy cotwins in discordant pairs have viromes associated with, although not necessarily mediators, of SAM; as such, they provide a human model for delineating normal versus perturbed postnatal acquisition and retention of the gut microbiota's viral component in populations at risk for malnutrition.",

    "abstract": "Individual measures of socioeconomic status (SES) suppress genetic variance in body mass index (BMI). Our objective was to examine the influence of both individual-level (i.e., educational attainment, household income) and macrolevel (i.e., neighborhood socioeconomic advantage) SES indicators on genetic contributions to BMI.\nThe study used education level data from 4,162 monozygotic (MZ) and 1,900 dizygotic (DZ) same-sex twin pairs (64% female), income level data from 3,498 MZ and 1,534 DZ pairs (65% female), and neighborhood-level socioeconomic deprivation data from 2,327 MZ and 948 DZ pairs (65% female). Covariates included age (M = 40.4 \u00b1 17.5 years), sex, and ethnicity. The cotwin control model was used to evaluate the mechanisms through which SES influences BMI (e.g., through genetic vs. environmental pathways), and a gene-by-environment interaction model was used to test whether residual variance in BMI, after controlling for the main effects of SES, was moderated by socioeconomic measures.\nSES significantly predicted BMI. The association was noncausal, however, and instead was driven primarily through a common underlying genetic background that tended to grow less influential as SES increased. After controlling for the main effect of SES, both genetic and nonshared environmental variance decreased with increasing SES.\nThe impact of individual and macrolevel SES on BMI extends beyond its main effects. The influence of genes on BMI is moderated by individual and macrolevel measures of SES, such that when SES is higher, genetic factors become less influential.",

    "abstract": "The clinical conditions of various diseases, including coronary artery disease, are determined by genetics and the environment. Previous investigations noted the significance of genetic mutations and polymorphisms in cases of coronary spasm.\nWe report on monozygotic identical twins who almost simultaneously presented with vasospastic angina. The 58-year-old younger twin was admitted to our hospital because of persistent chest pain. An electrocardiogram showed an inverted T wave in the left precordial leads. Coronary angiographies revealed a short left main trunk (LMT) and 50% stenosis at the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Infusion of acetylcholine to his left coronary artery caused marked vasoconstriction associated with a sensation of chest oppression. Nitroglycerine completely reversed this response. Based on these findings, we diagnosed Twin A with vasospastic angina. At nearly the same time, his identical twin brother was diagnosed with vasospastic angina at another hospital. Comparison of both coronary angiograms indicated similar structure of coronary vessels, including short LMT and mild stenosis at the proximal portion of LAD.\nThese 2 cases highlight the importance of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of vasospastic angina. It may be important for individuals to receive medical attention if their identical twin presents with vasospastic angina.",

Abnormal Doppler was defined as continuous (type II, n = 41) or intermittent (type III, n = 49) absent/reversed end-diastolic flow. All cases presented at least one of the following severity criteria: gestational age (GA) <22 weeks, inter-twin estimated weight discordance >35%, reversed end-diastolic umbilical artery flow or ductus venosus pulsatility index >95th centile. We prospectively recorded pregnancy course and perinatal outcome.\nMedian GA at surgery was 20.6 weeks and mean duration 22.4 min. Miscarriage (<24 weeks) occurred in 3.3% (3/90) and preterm delivery <32 weeks in 7.1% (6/84) of continuing pregnancies.

    "abstract": "A trend toward greater body size in dizygotic (DZ) than in monozygotic (MZ) twins has been suggested by some but not all studies, and this difference may also vary by age. We analyzed zygosity differences in mean values and variances of height and body mass index (BMI) among male and female twins from infancy to old age. Data were derived from an international database of 54 twin cohorts participating in the COllaborative project of Development of Anthropometrical measures in Twins (CODATwins), and included 842,951 height and BMI measurements from twins aged 1 to 102 years. The results showed that DZ twins were consistently taller than MZ twins, with differences of up to 2.0 cm in childhood and adolescence and up to 0.9 cm in adulthood. Similarly, a greater mean BMI of up to 0.3 kg/m2 in childhood and adolescence and up to 0.2 kg/m2 in adulthood was observed in DZ twins, although the pattern was less consistent. DZ twins presented up to 1.7% greater height and 1.9% greater BMI than MZ twins; these percentage differences were largest in middle and late childhood and decreased with age in both sexes. The variance of height was similar in MZ and DZ twins at most ages. In contrast, the variance of BMI was significantly higher in DZ than in MZ twins, particularly in childhood. In conclusion, DZ twins were generally taller and had greater BMI than MZ twins, but the differences decreased with age in both sexes.",

    "abstract": "Although a higher protein intake, particularly from vegetable sources, has been shown to be associated with higher bone mineral density (BMD) the relative impact of specific amino acids on BMD and risk of osteoporosis remains to be determined. Mechanistic research suggests that a number of specific amino acids, including five nonessential amino acids--alanine, arginine, glutamic acid, glycine, and proline--may play a role in bone health, principally through improved production of insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 and the synthesis of collagen and muscle protein. However to date, no previous studies have examined the associations between habitual intake of amino acids and direct measures of BMD and prevalence of osteoporosis or osteopenia, and no studies have examined this relationship in discordant identical twin-pairs. In these analyses of female monozygotic twin-pairs discordant for amino acid intake (n = 135), twins with higher intakes of alanine and glycine had significantly higher BMD at the spine than their co-twins with within-pair differences in spine-BMD of 0.012 g/cm(2) (SE 0.01; p = 0.039) and 0.014 g/cm(2) (SE 0.01; p = 0.026), respectively. Furthermore, in cross-sectional multivariable analyses of 3160 females aged 18 to 79 years, a higher intake of total protein was significantly associated with higher DXA-measured BMD at the spine (quartile Q4 to quartile Q1: 0.017 g/cm(2), SE 0.01, p = 0.035) and forearm (Q4 to Q1: 0.010 g/cm(2), SE 0.003, p = 0.002). Intake of six amino acids (alanine, arginine, glutamic acid, leucine, lysine, and proline) were associated with higher BMD at the spine and forearm with the strongest association observed for leucine (Q4 to Q1: 0.024 g/cm(2), SE 0.01, p = 0.007). When intakes were stratified by protein source, vegetable or animal, prevalence of osteoporosis or osteopenia was 13% to 19% lower comparing extreme quartiles of vegetable intake for five amino acids (not glutamic acid or proline). These data provide evidence to suggest that intake of protein and several amino acids, including alanine and glycine, may be beneficial for bone health, independent of genetic background.",

    "abstract": "To date, several studies have investigated the intergenerational effect of preterm and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) births. However, most studies excluded both twin mothers and twin offspring from the analyses. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the intergenerational effect of preterm birth and SGA births among twins and singletons. A prospective population-based register study of mother-firstborn offspring pairs recorded in the Swedish Medical Birth Register was performed. The study included 4,073 twins and 264,794 singletons born from 1973-1983 and their firstborns born from 1986-2009. Preterm birth was defined as birth at <37 weeks of gestation, and SGA as birth weight <2 standard deviations of the Swedish standard. Logistic regressions were performed to estimate the intergenerational effect of each birth characteristic. Adjustments were made for maternal grandmothers' and mothers' socio-demographic factors, in addition to maternal birth characteristics. Among mothers born as singletons, being born preterm was associated with an increased risk of delivering a preterm child (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.39, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.29-1.50), while being born SGA increased the likelihood of having an SGA child (adjusted OR 3.04, 95% CI = 2.80-3.30) as well as a preterm child (adjusted OR 1.30, 95% CI = 1.20-1.40). In twin mothers, the corresponding ORs tended to be lower, and the only statistically significant association was between an SGA mother and an SGA child (adjusted OR 2.15, 95% CI = 1.40-3.31). A statistically significant interaction between twinning and mother's size for gestational age was identified in a multivariate linear regression analysis, indicating that singleton mothers born SGA were associated with a lower birth weight compared with mothers not born SGA. Preterm birth and SGA appear to be transferred from one generation to the next, although not always reaching statistical significance. These effects seem to be less evident in mothers born as twins compared with those born as singletons.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins, considered to be genetically identical, cannot be distinguished from one another by standard forensic DNA testing. A recent study employed whole genome sequencing to identify extremely rare mutations and reported that mutation analysis could be used to differentiate between MZ twins. Compared with nuclear DNA, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has higher mutation rates; therefore, minor differences theoretically exist in MZ twins' mitochondrial genome (mtGenome). However, conventional Sanger-type sequencing (STS) is neither amenable to, nor feasible for, the detection of low-level sequence variants. The recent introduction of massively parallel sequencing (MPS) has the capability to sequence many targeted regions of multiple samples simultaneously with desirable depth of coverage. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess whether full mtGenome sequencing analysis can be used to differentiate between MZ twins. Ten sets of MZ twins provided blood samples that underwent extraction, quantification, mtDNA enrichment, library preparation, and ultra-deep sequencing. Point heteroplasmies were observed in eight sets of MZ twins, and a single nucleotide variant (nt15301) was detected in five sets of MZ twins. Thus, this study demonstrates that ultra-deep mtGenome sequencing could be used to differentiate between MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is essential in mammalian development. We have hypothesized that methylation differences induced by trisomy 21 (T21) contribute to the phenotypic characteristics and heterogeneity in Down syndrome (DS). In order to determine the methylation differences in T21 without interference of the interindividual genomic variation, we have used fetal skin fibroblasts from monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for T21. We also used skin fibroblasts from MZ twins concordant for T21, normal MZ twins without T21, and unrelated normal and T21 individuals. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) revealed 35 differentially methylated promoter regions (DMRs) (Absolute methylation differences = 25%, FDR < 0.001) in MZ twins discordant for T21 that have also been observed in comparison between unrelated normal and T21 individuals. The identified DMRs are enriched for genes involved in embryonic organ morphogenesis (FDR = 1.60 e -03) and include genes of the HOXB and HOXD clusters. These DMRs are maintained in iPS cells generated from this twin pair and are correlated with the gene expression changes. We have also observed an increase in DNA methylation level in the T21 methylome compared to the normal euploid methylome. This observation is concordant with the up regulation of DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMT3B and DNMT3L) and down regulation of DNA demethylation enzymes (TET2 and TET3) observed in the iPSC of the T21 versus normal twin. Altogether, the results of this study highlight the epigenetic effects of the extra chromosome 21 in T21 on loci outside of this chromosome that are relevant to DS associated phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Background. A person-centered approach focusing on the interaction of an individual's temperament-character-life events is essential in the path of individuals' well-being. In this context, three character traits, Self-directedness (e.g., self-acceptance, self-control, goal-directed behavior), Cooperativeness (e.g., social affiliation, social tolerance, empathy and helpfulness) and Self-transcendence (e.g., spiritual acceptance, transpersonal identification), measured using Cloninger's model of personality are suggested to help the individual to regulate and resolve the conflicts derived from her/his temperament combinations as a reaction to life events. However, if character is related to the individual's cognitive ability, then this association might limit any intervention that focuses on character development. We used data from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS) to investigate the relationship between personality and cognitive ability. Method. The sample consisted of 370 15-year-old twins (159 girls/211 boys), 192 of whom screen-positive with various types of mental health problems. We used the Temperament and Character Inventory to measure personality and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC-IV) to measure intelligence. The relationship was investigated using correlation analyses using random-selected twins from each dyad and separately for monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Additional analyses investigated the genetic and environmental effects on personality and cognitive ability in this specific sample. Results. There were no significant correlations between the WISC-IV indices and any of the character traits (i.e., Self-directedness, Cooperativeness, and Self-transcendence). Persistence was significantly related, if weak, to four WISC-IV indices: Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and the Full WISC-IV Scale. Post-hoc cross-twin/cross-trait analyses showed that the Persistence-cognitive ability correlation might depend on common genetic effects. The WISC-IV indices showed a relatively large genetic influence, while earlier findings about the etiology of temperament and character traits using the whole CATSS sample were replicated in this sub-sample of twins. Conclusions. The results indicate that what individuals make of themselves intentionally (i.e., their character) was not associated to intelligence. Persistence, a temperament dimension that measures heritable individual differences in eagerness of effort, ambition, perfectionism, and resistance to discouragement despite frustration and fatigue, was weakly linked to intelligence. Suggesting that, at least during adolescence, interventions targeting character development are not limited by the individual's intelligence.",

    "abstract": "To our knowledge, this is the first study on rosacea to formally define genetic and environmental contributions.\nTo study a cohort of identical and fraternal twins to determine whether genetic factors contribute to rosacea development and, if genetic factors are present, quantitatively estimate the genetic contribution, as well as to identify environmental factors that correlate with rosacea by controlling for genetic susceptibility.\nIdentical and fraternal twins were surveyed regarding risk factors implicated in rosacea. Faculty dermatologists determined a rosacea score for each twin participant according to the National Rosacea Society (NRS) grading system. Data were collected at the annual Twins Days Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, on August 4-5, 2012, and August 2-3, 2013. Analysis was conducted for several months after each meeting. A cohort of 550 twin individuals, with most from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the northeastern United States, participated.\nThe NRS score and rosacea subtype were assessed using the NRS grading system and physical examination by board-certified dermatologists.\nAmong the 275 twin pairs (550 individuals), there were 233 identical twin pairs with a mean rosacea score of 2.46 and 42 fraternal twin pairs with a mean rosacea score of 0.75. We observed a higher association of NRS scores between identical vs fraternal twins (r\u2009=\u20090.69 vs r\u2009=\u20090.46; P\u2009=\u2009.04), demonstrating a genetic contribution. Using the ACE model (proportion of variance in a trait heritable secondary to additive genetics [A] vs the proportions due to a common environment [C] and unique environment [E]), we calculated this genetic contribution to be 46%. A higher NRS score was also significantly associated with the following factors: age (r\u2009=\u20090.38; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and lifetime UV radiation exposure (r\u2009=\u20090.26; P\u2009<\u2009.001). These associations remained after use of propensity score matching to adjust for multicollinearity. Other correlated variables included body mass index (r\u2009=\u20090.21; P\u2009<\u2009.001), smoking (r\u2009=\u20090.10; P\u2009<\u2009.02), alcohol consumption (r\u2009=\u20090.11; P\u2009=\u2009.01), cardiovascular comorbidity (r\u2009=\u20090.17; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and skin cancer comorbidity (r\u2009=\u20090.19; P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nThe study of twins allows us to separate genetic susceptibility and the influence of environmental factors affecting rosacea. We found that approximately half of the contribution to the NRS score could be accounted for by genetics and the other half by environment. We identified correlations between rosacea and UV radiation exposure, alcohol, smoking, skin cancer history, cardiac comorbidity, and age. These findings may help improve current management and expectations of individuals affected by rosacea.",

    "abstract": "Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation, and Autonomic Dysregulation (ROHHAD) is thought to be a genetic disease caused by de novo mutations, though causative mutations have yet to be identified. We searched for de novo coding mutations among a carefully-diagnosed and clinically homogeneous cohort of 35 ROHHAD patients.\nWe sequenced the exomes of seven ROHHAD trios, plus tumours from four of these patients and the unaffected monozygotic (MZ) twin of one (discovery cohort), to identify constitutional and somatic de novo sequence variants. We further analyzed this exome data to search for candidate genes under autosomal dominant and recessive models, and to identify structural variations. Candidate genes were tested by exome or Sanger sequencing in a replication cohort of 28 ROHHAD singletons.\nThe analysis of the trio-based exomes found 13 de novo variants. However, no two patients had de novo variants in the same gene, and additional patient exomes and mutation analysis in the replication cohort did not provide strong genetic evidence to implicate any of these sequence variants in ROHHAD. Somatic comparisons revealed no coding differences between any blood and tumour samples, or between the two discordant MZ twins. Neither autosomal dominant nor recessive analysis yielded candidate genes for ROHHAD, and we did not identify any potentially causative structural variations.\nClinical exome sequencing is highly unlikely to be a useful diagnostic test in patients with true ROHHAD. As ROHHAD has a high risk for fatality if not properly managed, it remains imperative to expand the search for non-exomic genetic risk factors, as well as to investigate other possible mechanisms of disease. In so doing, we will be able to confirm objectively the ROHHAD diagnosis and to contribute to our understanding of obesity, respiratory control, hypothalamic function, and autonomic regulation.",

Somatic comparisons revealed no coding differences between any blood and tumour samples, or between the two discordant MZ twins. Neither autosomal dominant nor recessive analysis yielded candidate genes for ROHHAD, and we did not identify any potentially causative structural variations.",

    "abstract": "We report our experience on the application of Gratacos' classification in a cohort of monochorionic pregnancies complicated by selective intra-uterine growth retardation based on the Doppler assessment of the umbilical artery.\nA retrospective study was conducted on 52 cases of monochorionic twin pregnancies, in which one twin presented an abdominal circumference at or below the 10th percentile for gestational age. Cases were classified into three types according to the umbilical artery Doppler in the smaller twin. Subsequently, patients were divided into two groups: the selective IntraUterine Growth Retardation group and the Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS) group.\nOf the total 52 cases, 37 were classified as Type I, 12 as Type II, and 3 as Type III cases. In the total group, progressive fetal deterioration of the smaller fetus requiring active management was observed in 66.7% of Type II and 11.1% of Type I cases (p < .001), and in no Type III case. Unexpected fetal death of the smaller twin was observed more frequently in Type III (two cases, 66.7%) than in Types I and II cases (5% and 33%, respectively). Among the 52 cases, TTTS with oligo-polyhydramnios sequence was diagnosed in 10 cases. The remaining 42 cases were therefore defined as selective intra-uterine growth retardation. In the selective IntraUterine Growth Retardation group, results were similar to those obtained for the whole population.\nClassification of complicated monochorionic twins based on the umbilical artery Doppler is particularly important for counseling, even when we include TTTS cases, and permits the prediction of clinical evolution and perinatal outcome.",

    "abstract": "We set out to examine rates of perinatal mortality in twin pregnancies over a 17-year study period. Changes in mode of delivery were also examined as well as causes of death in twin mortalities.\nThis retrospective cohort study was performed at three large tertiary referral centers from 1996 to 2012. It included all normally formed twin infants with a birth weight more than 500 g. All cases of perinatal mortality in twin pregnancies (infants more than 500\u2009g who suffered an intrauterine or early neonatal (\u2264 7 days of age) death were recorded. The changing rate of cesarean delivery as well as varying causes of death in twins over the course of the study were also examined.\nDuring the study period, there were 395,830 pregnancies across the three institutions, this included 6,727 twin gestations. The perinatal mortality rate was 21.5/1,000 twin infants. The perinatal mortality rate in twins decreased over the study period (p\u2009=\u20090.0006; R (2)\u2009=\u20090.55; slope\u2009=\u2009-1.2). Rates of cesarean delivery in twin gestations were found to have increased over the course of the study (p\u2009<\u20090.0001; R (2)\u2009=\u20090.84; slope\u2009=\u20091.7). There were 288 intrauterine and early neonatal deaths in twin infants, 50% (147/288) occurred in twins born extremely premature (< 26 weeks). Prematurity was the leading cause of mortality in twins, followed by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). TTTS was found to have a decreasing contribution to perinatal mortality during the study (p\u2009=\u20090.008; R (2)\u2009=\u20090.38; slope\u2009=\u2009-1.5).\nThe perinatal mortality rate in twins improved during the study. The rate of cesarean delivery increased by 1.7% for each year of the study, culminating in a cesarean delivery rate of 62% in 2012. TTTS made a decreasing contribution to the mortality rate in twins during the study.",

    "abstract": "The increasing number of multiple pregnancies in recent years has raised a particular concern about the problems associated to these pregnancies. It still remains unclear whether twin deliveries, as currently conceived, provide the same future health chances to both fetuses. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that the effects of obstetric and neonatal care beyond the perinatal period have not often been evaluated. The main objective of this research was to analyze the impact of obstetric and perinatal variables on postnatal neuropsychological development, intelligence and school achievement of twin children.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional and observational study on 62 pairs of 6-year-old twins, who were on their first year of primary education. All 124 children and their mother were individually assessed and perinatal clinical data were collected. A stratified multivariate analysis was performed using multiple linear regressions.\nThe type of birth was the best predicting variable, so that the best results were achieved in children born in spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Comparatively, however, poorer scores were seen in males second twins born by the vaginal route in spatial structuring, non-verbal development and total development areas, especially in case of delivery before 37 weeks.\nOur study confirms the impact of some obstetric variables on school achievement and psychological development of twins.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancy- and birth-related factors may have an effect on handedness. Compared with singletons, twins have a lower birth weight, shorter gestational age, and are at higher risk for birth complications. We tested whether the prevalence of left-handedness is higher among twins than singletons, and if so, whether that difference is fully explained by pregnancy and birth-related differences between twins and singletons. We analyzed Finnish population-based datasets; included were 8,786 twins and 5,892 singletons with information on birth weight (n = 12,381), Apgar scores (n = 11,129), and gestational age (n = 11,811). Two twin cohorts were involved: FinnTwin12 included twins born during 1983-1987, and FinnTwin16 included twins born during 1974-1979. We had two comparison groups of singletons: 4,101 individuals born during 1986-1988 and enrolled in the Helsinki Ultrasound Trial, and 1,791 individuals who were partners of FinnTwin16 twins. We used logistic regression models with writing hand as the outcome for comparison and evaluating effects of covariates. Left-handedness was more common in twins (9.67%) than in singletons (8.27%; p = .004). However, Apgar scores were associated with handedness, and after controlling for covariates, we found no difference in the prevalence of left-handedness between twins and singletons. Increased left-handedness among twins, often reported by others, was evident in our data, but only among our older twin cohorts, and that association disappeared after removing effects of perinatal covariates.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence shows that some cancers originate in utero. It is hypothesized that elevated exposure to some steroid hormones might increase cancer risk and that hormone transfer between twin fetuses could result in different prenatal exposure to testosterone.\nThis large-scale prospective twin study compared opposite-sex (OS) and same-sex (SS) twins to test the impact of intrauterine exposures on cancer risk. On the basis of the Danish and Swedish twin and cancer registries, we calculated incidence rate ratios for OS and SS twins, whereas standardized incidence ratios (SIR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for OS/SS twins compared with the general population.\nA total of 18,001 cancers were identified during 1943-2009. No significant differences were observed between OS and SS twins, neither for the sex-specific cancers nor for cancer at all sites. All-cause cancer was slightly reduced for OS and SS twins compared with the general population, significant for OS males (SIR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.98) and for SS males and females (SIR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99).\nOur data suggest that having a male co-twin-which may entail higher exposure to prenatal testosterone-does not increase the risk of sex-specific cancers in OS females. Furthermore, the study supports that twinning per se is not a risk factor of cancer.\nFindings are reassuring, as they fail to provide evidence for the hypothesis that endocrine or other difference in the in utero milieu affects the risk of sex-specific cancers.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal and early postnatal adversities have been shown to be associated with brain development. However, we do not know how much of this association is confounded by genetics, nor whether the postnatal environment can moderate the impact of in utero adversity. This study used a monozygotic (MZ) twin design to assess (1) the association between birth weight (BW) and brain volume in adolescence, (2) the association between within-twin-pair BW discordance and brain volume discordance in adolescence, and (3) whether the association between BW and brain volume in adolescence is mediated or moderated by early negative maternal parenting behaviours. These associations were assessed in a sample of 108 MZ twins followed longitudinally since birth and scanned at age 15. The total grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes were obtained using the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) toolbox in the Statistical Parametric Mapping version 8 (SPM8). We found that the BW was significantly associated with the total GM and WM volumes, particularly in the superior frontal gyrus and thalamus. Within-twin-pair discordance in BW was also significantly associated with within-pair discordance in both the GM and the WM volumes, supporting the hypothesis that the specific in utero environment is associated with brain development independently of genetics. Early maternal hostile parenting behaviours and depressive symptoms were associated with total GM volume but not WM volume. Finally, greater early maternal hostility may moderate the association between the BW and GM volume in adolescence, since the positive association between the BW and total GM volume appeared stronger at higher levels of maternal hostility (trend). Together, these findings support the importance of the in utero and early environments for brain development.",

The aim of our study was to evaluate the rate of cerebral lesions detected at fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and to correlate the results with the neurologic outcome of the survivors of monochorionic twin pregnancies after sFD.\nBetween 2005 and 2012, 11 monochorionic twin pregnancies with sFD and subsequent fetal MRI of the survivor were included. All neonates underwent neurologic assessment after birth and 56% of surviving infants underwent long-term neurologic assessment. MRI findings and neurologic outcome of the survivors were evaluated.\nGestational age at sFD was 20.9 (\u00b12.9) weeks; 55% (6/11) of survivors of monochorionic twin pregnancies after sFD showed cerebral lesions at fetal MRI; 72% (8/11) of all survivors had normal neonatal neurologic outcome: all survivors with normal fetal MRI and 50% of survivors with cerebral lesions at fetal MRI. Long-term neurologic assessment was normal in all tested patients with normal fetal MRI and in one of three tested patients with cerebral lesions at fetal MRI.\nSurvivors of monochorionic twin pregnancies after sFD show a high rate of cerebral lesions at fetal MRI. The importance of cerebral lesions at fetal MRI in survivors after sFD in monochorionic twin pregnancies is uncertain.

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a unique type of monozygotic twins. All monozygotic twins should be thoroughly evaluated for incomplete separation and, if incomplete separation is diagnosed, the extent of internal organ connection and the presence of additional developmental anomalies of the foetuses should be assessed. Common heart of foetuses is particularly difficult to diagnose and crucial for prognosis. We present an example of female thoracoomohalopagus twins with a common triventricular heart, connate livers, and joined hepatic vessels, diagnosed in week 12 of pregnancy Due to the high complexity of foetal connection, separation was not possible and following interdisciplinary consultation, the pregnancy was aborted upon the patient's request in week 16.",

    "abstract": "Perianal abscesses (PA) are relatively common in children, especially in infants. The aetiology of PA is still unknown but several factors point toward a congenital aetiology: 1) it is almost exclusively seen in infants, 2) with a male predominance, 3) predilection sites at 3 and 9 o'clock, 4) the finding of abnormal Morgagni crypts and 5) aberrant epithelial lining. Traditionally, incision and drainage has been the treatment of choice, but several studies suggest conservative management. The effect of antibiotics has not been proven. In this case report we present two 29-day-old monozygous twin boys with PA.",

    "abstract": "Menkes disease (MD) is a rare X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene. This neurodegenerative disorder typically affects males and is characterized by impaired copper distribution and the malfunction of several copper-dependent enzymes. We report clinically discordant female monozygotic twins (MZT) with a heterozygous ATP7A mutation. One twin girl is healthy at the current age of 4 years, whereas the other twin girl developed classical MD, showed disease stabilization under copper histidine treatment but died at the age of 3 years. Presumably, the affected girl developed MD due to skewed X inactivation, although this could not be demonstrated in two tissues (blood, buccal mucosa). This case is a rare example of an affected girl with MD and shows the possibility of a discordant phenotype in MZT girls. As speculated in other X-linked diseases, the process of monozygotic twinning may be associated with skewed X inactivation leading to a discordant phenotype.",

We found that a substantial part (40\u2005per cent) of the variation in AFB is caused by latent family characteristics. Genetic dispositions (26\u2005per cent) play a more important role than the shared environment of siblings (14\u2005per cent), with the non-shared environment/measurement error having the strongest influence (60\u2005per cent). Like previous studies, this study reveals marked changes in estimates over time, and supports the idea that environmental constraints (war or economic crisis) suppress and normative freedom (sexual revolution) promotes the activation of genetic predispositions that affect fertility. We show that the exclusion of censored information (i.e., on the childless) by previous studies biased their results.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether depression symptomatology is associated with low back pain (LBP) in twins aged 70+ and whether this effect depends on a person's physical activity (PA) status.\nThis prospective cohort and nested case-control study used a nationally representative sample of twins. Data on depression symptomatology (modified Cambridge Mental Disorders Examination) and self-reported PA were obtained from the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins using twins without LBP at baseline. Associations between depression symptomatology (highest quartile) at baseline and LBP two years later were investigated using logistic regression analyses adjusted for sex. To examine the moderating effect of PA, we tested its interaction with depression. Associations were analysed using the complete sample of 2446 twins and a matched case-control analysis of 97 twin pairs discordant for LBP at follow-up. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.\nUsing the whole sample, high depression scores were associated with an increased probability of LBP (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.22-1.99, P \u2264 0.01). There was no statistically significant interaction of light PA and depression symptomatology (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46-1.35, P = 0.39) and strenuous PA and depression symptomatology (0.84, 95% CI 0.50-1.41, P = 0.51). The case-control analysis showed similar ORs, although statistically insignificant.\nHigh depression symptomatology predicted incident LBP. This effect is supposedly not attributable to genetic or shared environmental factors. Physical activity did not moderate the effect of depression symptomatology on LBP.",

    "abstract": "Chorion type may significantly influence the prenatal environment of twins. This study explored the associations between chorion type and gestational age, birth weight, birth length, and the timing of emergence of the first primary tooth in two populations of twins, Australian and Dutch. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between chorion type and birth weight discordance (BWD) in order to determine whether a significant relationship existed between discordance in birth weight and discordance in the timing of emergence of the first primary tooth. The two study samples consisted of 409 Australian twin pairs and 301 Dutch twin pairs, all of European ancestry. Data were collected through a combination of questionnaires and recording charts administered to the parents and through linkage with biological databases. In the Australian sample, monozygotic monochorionic (MZMC) twins experienced the shortest mean gestation time (35 weeks), the lowest mean birth length (46 cm) and the lowest mean birth weight (2.3 kg) compared with other twin groups. For the same variables in the Dutch sample, these trends with MZMC twinning were not observed. Chorion type did not significantly affect the mean timing of emergence of the first primary tooth in either sample. Monochorionicity was found to be significantly associated with BWD in both samples, but there was a significant association between BWD in MZMC twin pairs and timing of emergence of the first primary tooth only in the Australian sample. Results from this study support previous findings that the timing of emergence of the first primary tooth is influenced strongly by genetic factors and is well protected from environmental disturbances.",

    "abstract": "Discriminating individuals within a pair of monozygotic (MZ) twins using genetic markers remains unresolved. This inability causes problems in criminal or paternity cases involving MZ twins as suspects or alleged fathers. Our previous study showed DNA methylation differences in interspersed repeat sequences such as Alu and LINE-1 within pairs of newborn MZ twins. To further evaluate the possible value of LINE-1 DNA methylation for discriminating MZ twins, this study investigated the LINE-1 DNA methylation of a large number of twins. We collected blood samples and buccal cell samples from 119 pairs of MZ and 57 pairs of dizygotic (DZ) twins. Genomic DNA was extracted and LINE-1 methylation level was detected using bisulfite pyrosequencing. The mean methylation level of the three CpG sites in the blood sample among the 176 unrelated individuals was 76.60% and 70.08% in buccal samples. This difference was significant, indicating the tissue specificity of LINE-1 DNA methylation. Among 119 pairs of MZ twins, 15 pairs could be discriminated according to the difference of CpG methylation level between them, which accounted for 12.61% of total number of MZ pairs. As for DZ twins, 10 pairs had significant differences between two individuals, which accounted for 17.54% of the total 57 DZ pairs. In conclusion, there are global DNA methylation differences within some healthy concordant monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs. LINE-1 DNA methylation might be a potential marker for helping to discriminate individuals within MZ twin pairs, and the tissue specificity must be considered in practice.",

    "abstract": "In biology proteins from different structural classes interact across and within classes in ways that are optimized to achieve balanced functional outputs. The interactions between intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and other proteins rely on changes in flexibility and this is seen as a strong determinant for their function. This has fostered the notion that IDP's bind with low affinity but high specificity. Here we have analyzed available detailed thermodynamic data for protein-protein interactions to put to the test if the thermodynamic profiles of IDP interactions differ from those of other protein-protein interactions. We find that ordered proteins and the disordered ones act as non-identical twins operating by similar principles but where the disordered proteins complexes are on average less stable by 2.5 kcal mol(-1).",

    "abstract": "The knowledge about adaptive mechanisms of monochorionic placentas to fulfill the demands of two instead of one fetus is largely speculative. The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of chorionicity on birth weight and placental weight in twin pregnancies.\nForty Monochorionic (MC) and 43 dichorionic (DC) twin pregnancies were included in this retrospective study. Individual and total (sum of both twins) birth weights, placental weights ratios between placental and birth weights and observed-to-expected (O/E)-ratios were calculated and analyzed. Additionally, we investigated whether in twin pregnancies placental and birth weights follow the law of allometric metabolic scaling.\nMC pregnancies showed higher placental O/E-ratios than DC ones (2.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.85 versus 1.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.61; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas the total neonatal birth weight O/E-ratios were not different. In DC twins total placental weights correlated significantly with gestational age (r\u00a0=\u00a00.74, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but not in MC twins. Analysis of deliveries \u226432 weeks revealed that the placenta to birth weight ratio in MC twins was higher than in matched DC twins (0.49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 versus 0.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Allometric metabolic scaling revealed that dichorionic twin placentas scale with birth weight, while the monochorionic ones do not.\nThe weight of MC placentas compared to that of DC is not gestational age dependent in the third trimester. Therefore an early accelerated placental growth pattern has to be postulated which leads to an excess placental mass particularly below 32 weeks of gestation. The monochorionic twins do not follow allometric metabolic scaling principle making them more vulnerable to placental compromise.",

    "abstract": "Shared psychotic disorder, characterized by shared delusion among two or more subjects (termed \"Folie \u00e0 deux,\" \"trois,\" etc.), is often associated with strong religious beliefs or social isolation, factors creating strong psychological sympathy. Recently, we treated a rare familial case of \"Folie \u00e0 quatre\" in central Tokyo without such influences. The proband was a schizophrenia patient and younger brother within monozygotic twins. Positive symptoms were \"transmitted\" to remaining family members, his elder brother, mother, and father father, in a relatively short period of three months. Although the pathophysiology of these positive symptoms (delusions and hallucinations) remains unclear, the transmission pattern suggests the primacy of social and environmental factors (and/or their interaction), while genetics appeared less influential in this \"Folie \u00e0 famille.\" Although undiagnosed psychoses in the whole family cannot be excluded, they did not share the other negative schizophrenia symptoms of the proband. A strong familial connection appeared to be the most important factor for the common delusion and hallucination.",

    "abstract": "There continues to be disagreement related to the appropriate therapeutic regimen to be used when the donor and the recipient in kidney transplant operations are identical twins. Here we present two cases of kidney transplantation between identical twins. Both recipients had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) caused by primary nephropathy. We also present information gleaned from a literature review of similar cases. The first recipient was a 26-year-old man who experienced biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy 10 months post-transplantation. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and steroids were used to reverse this pathologic condition. Till now, 76 months post-transplantation, the patient is stable, and the new kidney is functioning well. The second recipient was a 20-year-old woman who had hematuria and proteinuria 3 months post-transplantation, and crescent glomerulonephritis with mild to moderate interstitial injury was proven by biopsy 11 months postoperatively. This patient did not respond to various treatments and resumed hemodialysis 15 months post-transplantation. These case studies show that immunosuppressive therapy should be maintained in kidney transplant recipients who are identical twins with ESRD caused by initial nephropathy.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanism behind the structure of the internal cellular clock can lead to advances in the knowledge of origins of pairs of monozygotic twins and higher order multiples as well as other biological phenomena. To gain insight into this mechanism, we analyze possible cell labeling schemes that model an organism's development. Our findings lead us to predict that monozygotic quadruplets are not quadruplets in the traditional sense but rather two pairs of monozygotic twins where the pairs slightly differ-a situation we coin quadruplet twins. From the considered model, the probability of monozygotic twins is found to be (1/2) (K) , and we discover that the probability of monozygotic quadruplets, or triplets as in the case of the death of an embryo, is (1/8) (K) , where K is a species-specific integer representing the number of pairs of homologous chromosomes. The parameter K may determine cancerization with a probability threshold that is approximately inversely proportional to the Hayflick limit. Exposure to some cancerization factors such as small levels of ionizing radiation and chemical pollution may not produce cancer.",

    "abstract": "The genetic influence on dental arch morphology may be country-specific, thus it is reasonable to check the estimates of genetics across different populations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the heredity of dental arch morphology in the sample of Lithuanian twins with accurate zygosity determination.\nThe study sample consisted of digital dental models of 40 monozygotic (MZ) and 32 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. The estimates of heritability (h(2)) for dental arch breadth and length were calculated.\nAll dental arch breadths and lengths were statistically significantly larger in men than in women. Arch length differences between genders were less expressed than largest breadth differences. In the upper jaw the largest genetic effect was found on the arch breadth between lateral incisors. The heritability of dental arch length demonstrated similar differences between upper and lower jaw with mandible dental arch length being more genetically determined.\nThe largest genetic impact was found on the upper dental arch breadth between lateral incisors. Similar, but lower heritability is inherent for canines and first premolars of the upper jaw and first premolars of the lower jaw. It also can be noted, that arch breadths between posterior teeth show lower heritability estimates than between anterior teeth on both jaws. The dental arch in the upper jaw has more expressed genetic component than in the lower jaw.",

    "abstract": "In monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies, unequal placental sharing does not always lead to adverse outcomes. The aim of this study is to investigate how unequal placental sharing may be compensated by placental anatomical changes.\nBetween January 2012 and July 2013, a total of 60 uncomplicated MCDA pregnancies ending in live birth of healthy twins were studied. Placentas were divided into two groups; an equally shared placenta group (placenta territory discordance \u2264 25%, N = 40) and an unequally shared placenta group (placenta territory discordance >25%, N = 20). Angioarchitecture, cord insertion type and the distance between two cord insertions were compared.\nVascular anastomoses were seen in all 60 placentas, and 58 placentas (96.7%) had arterioarterial anastomoses (AA). The overall diameter of the AA was larger in the unequally shared placenta group as compared to the equally shared placentas (0.27 \u00b1 0.12 cm versus 0.19 \u00b1 0.1 cm, p < 0.05). The distance between the cord insertions was shorter in the unequally shared group (14.5 \u00b1 6.0 cm versus 18.3 \u00b1 6.5 cm, p < 0.05).\nThe absence of adverse outcomes in unequally shared placenta group can be explained by the presence of large AA and shorter distance between cord insertions, protecting the twin with the smaller placental part against growth restriction and other pathology.",

    "abstract": "Increased utilization of in vitro fertilization (IVF) to treat infertility has resulted in a growing twin birthrate. Despite early childhood risks, twins have fewer psychosocial problems in middle childhood than singleton children. This study proposes that parents' conformity expectations for children have differential effects on parent-child relationships for twin and singleton children, which indirectly explains twins' more optimum psychosocial adjustment. Parental conformity expectations, parent-child relationship satisfaction, and children's emotional, behavioral, and attention problems were assessed in a sample of 288 6- to 12-year-old IVF-conceived twins and singletons. Overall, parents of twins had higher expectations for child conformity to parent rules than singleton parents. Path models demonstrate that twin status and parental expectations for child conformity interact to influence parent-child relationships, and this interaction indirectly accounted for differences in twins' and singletons' psychosocial adjustment. Findings suggest parenting constructs have differential influences on the association between twin status and parent-child relationships. Parenting research, predominantly conducted with singletons, should be reexamined before applying existing research to twin children and their families.",

    "abstract": "The mother-offspring social unit is a universal feature in the social life of all mammals and nursing is the most direct and vital component of maternal investment in young. Living in diverse environments, various ungulate species have different strategies for rearing offspring, from bearing a single, relatively large newborn and supplying only limited amounts of milk, to bearing several relatively small newborns with intensive post-partum lactation. In this paper, we consider the rearing strategy of goitered gazelle with a focus on suckling behavior, which, until now, has never been a subject of special investigation. Adult females of this species in their reproductive prime typically bear twins when environmental conditions are favorable, but the proportion of singletons increases when conditions are unfavorable. We expected that in goitered gazelles suckling intensity would be maximal during the first weeks after birth, and then decrease with the growth of the young; we also expected that twins would demand more energy, but receive significantly less maternal investment per young than singletons. We found that, indeed, suckling behavior had similar dynamics as typical of all bovid species, but our expectation for less maternal investment in twins vs. singletons was wrong. In reality, female goitered gazelles suckled twins significantly more intensively and terminated suckling less often compared to singletons. We concluded that in favorable situations females of high quality have the ability to show significantly more maternal investment in each twin, while singletons are typically born to weaker females. This ability of females to produce mostly twins allows goitered gazelles to take advantage of any favorable opportunity to quickly increase their population in an environment with unpredictable and abrupt yearly changes typical of the arid regions of Central Asia.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of selected dental variations in association with infraocclusion, as well as determining the effects of infraocclusion on dental development and tooth size, in singletons and twins.\nTwo samples were analysed. The first sample comprised 1454 panoramic radiographs of singleton boys and girls aged 8-11 years. The second sample comprised dental models of 202 pairs of monozygotic and dizygotic twins aged 8-11 years. Adobe Photoshop CS5 was used to construct reference lines and measure the extent of infraocclusion (in mm) of primary molars on the panoramic radiographs and on 2D images obtained from the dental models. The panoramic radiographs were examined for the presence of selected dental variations and to assess dental development following the Demirjian and Willems systems. The twins' dental models were measured to assess mesiodistal crown widths.\nIn the singleton sample there was a significant association of canines in an altered position during eruption and the lateral incisor complex (agenesis and/or small tooth size) with infraocclusion (P<0.001), but there was no significant association between infraocclusion and agenesis of premolars. Dental age assessment revealed that dental development was delayed in individuals with infraocclusion compared to controls. The primary mandibular canines were significantly smaller in size in the infraoccluded group (P<0.05).\nThe presence of other dental variations in association with infraocclusion, as well as delayed dental development and reduced tooth size, suggests the presence of a pleiotropic effect. The underlying aetiological factors may be genetic and/or epigenetic.",

    "abstract": "It is a common practice to use a singleton fetal growth standard to assess twin growth. We aim to create a twin fetal weight standard which is also adjustable for race/ethnicity and other factors.\nOver half a million twin births of low risk pregnancies in the US, from 1995 to 2004, were used to construct a fetal weight standard. We used the Hadlock's fetal growth standard and the proportionality principle to make the standard adjustable for other factors such as race/ethnicity. We validated the standard in different race/ethnicities in the US and against previously published curves from around the world.\nThe adjustable fetal weight standard has an excellent match with the observed birthweight data in non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanics, and Asian from 24 to 38 weeks gestation. It also had a very good fit with cross-sectional data from Australia and Norway, and a longitudinal standard from Brazil. However, our model-based 10th and 90th percentiles differed substantially from studies in Japan and US that used the last menstrual period for estimate of gestational age.\nThe adjustable fetal weight standard for twins is a flexible tool and can be used in different populations.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a strong heritable basis, as evidenced by twin concordance rates. Within ASD, symptom domains may arise via independent genetic contributions, with varying heritabilities and genetic mechanisms. In this article, we explore social functioning in the form of (i) electrophysiological and behavioral measures of face processing (P1 and N170) and (ii) social behavior among child and adolescent twins with (N\u2009=\u200952) and without ASD (N\u2009=\u200966). Twins without ASD had better holistic face processing and face memory, faster P1 responses and greater sensitivity to the effects of facial inversion on P1. In contrast, N170 responses to faces were similar across diagnosis, with more negative amplitudes for faces vs non-face images. Across the sample, stronger social skills and fewer social difficulties were associated with faster P1 and N170 responses to upright faces, and better face memory. Twins were highly correlated within pairs across most measures, but correlations were significantly stronger for monozygotic vs dizygotic pairs on N170 latency and social problems. We suggest common developmental influences across twins for face processing and social behavior, but highlight (i) neural speed of face processing and (ii) social difficulties as important avenues in the search for genetic underpinnings in ASD.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation differences between monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia have been previously reported. However, the origin of methylation differences between monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia is not clear. The findings here argue that all DNA methylation differences may not necessarily represent the cause of the disease; rather some may result from the effect of antipsychotics.\nMethylation differences in rat brain regions and also in two pairs of unrelated monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia have been studied using genome-wide DNA methylation arrays at Arraystar Inc. (Rockville, Maryland, USA). The identified gene promoters showing significant alterations to DNA methylation were then further characterized using ingenuity pathway analysis (Ingenuity System Inc, CA, USA).\nPathway analysis of the most significant gene promoter hyper/hypomethylation revealed a significant enrichment of DNA methylation changes in biological networks and pathways directly relevant to neural development and psychiatric disorders. These included HIPPO signaling (p\u2009=\u20093.93E-03) and MAPK signaling (p\u2009=\u20094.27E-03) pathways involving hypermethylated genes in schizophrenia-affected patients as compared to their unaffected co-twins. Also, a number of significant pathways and networks involving genes with hypomethylated gene promoters have been identified. These included CREB signaling in neurons (p\u2009=\u20091.53E-02), Dopamine-DARPP32 feedback in cAMP signaling (p\u2009=\u20097.43E-03) and Ephrin receptors (p\u2009=\u20091.13E-02). Further, there was significant enrichment for pathways involved in nervous system development and function (p\u2009=\u20091.71E-03-4.28E-02).\nThe findings highlight the significance of antipsychotic drugs on DNA methylation in schizophrenia patients. The unique pathways affected by DNA methylation in the two pairs of monozygotic twins suggest that patient-specific pathways are responsible for the disease; suggesting that patient-specific treatment strategies may be necessary in treating the disorder. The study reflects the need for developing personalized medicine approaches that take into consideration epigenetic variations between patients.",

    "abstract": "This brief outline associates twins with several aspects of life in Ancient Greece. In Greek mythology twins caused ambivalent reactions and were believed to have ambivalent feelings for each other. Very often, they were viewed as the representatives of the dualistic nature of the universe. Heteropaternal superfecundation, which dominates in ancient myths, explains on one hand, the god-like qualities and, on the other hand, the mortal nature of many twins. An assumption is presented that legends referring to twins might reflect the territorial expansions of Ancient Greeks in Northern Mediterranean, around the Black Sea, in Asia Minor, as well as North East Africa. In conclusion, in Greek antiquity, twins have been used as transitional figures between myth and reality.",

    "abstract": "We recently reported sex-specific percent body fat (%BF) thresholds (males=23%, females=38%) above which, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) significantly increases. Using monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, we examined the influence of genetics on regional fat distribution measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, above and below these sex-specific thresholds for VAT accumulation.\nFifty-eight twin pairs (44 MZ, 14 DZ) were recruited from the University of Washington Twin Registry. Segmented linear regression was used to assess the threshold between VAT mass and %BF by sex and by zygosity. To assess the effect of genetics on VAT accumulation, Dunnett's T3 compared MZ and DZ pairs whether the twin pairs were both above the adiposity threshold or not.\n%BF thresholds for VAT accumulation were identified (%BF: M=20.6%, F=39.4%). Zygosity-specific thresholds were not significantly different (p>0.05). If at least one twin was below threshold, DZ twins still exhibited greater within-pair differences than MZ pairs in %BF (p=0.023) but not VAT (p=0.121).\nUsing a twin study approach, we observed no difference by zygosity for the threshold as which VAT accumulates. Additionally, for the first time we observed that while total BF is influenced by genetics, VAT accumulation may depend more on whether a person's %BF is above their sex-specific adiposity threshold. These results suggest that there may not be a genetic predisposition for VAT accumulation but rather it is a result of a predisposition for total fat accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a rare disorder leading to bone marrow failure, which if left untreated, is invariably fatal. Conventional therapies with immunosuppressive therapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are highly effective. HSCT can offer a greater outcome in younger patients who have an available HLA match-related donor. Recent studies showing the addition of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) to the conditioning regimen improves engraftment and reduces the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).There are currently two ATG preparations in the USA, equine (or horse) and rabbit ATG. These agents are pharmacologically distinct, having significant differences in their pharmacokinetics and in vivo immunosuppressive effects [N Engl J Med 365(5):430-438, 2011]. Here, we report a case of two monozygotic twins with constitutional SAA that evolved to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who both underwent allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSC) from the same single HLA antigen mismatched sibling donor with the only difference in the transplant regimen being the type of ATG used in the preparative regimen; one twin received horse ATG and the other received rabbit ATG during conditioning. This report emphasizes that dramatic differences in donor T cell chimerism and clinical outcomes including GVHD can occur as a consequence of the type of ATG that is utilized in the transplant conditioning regimen. These differences highlight that these agents should not be considered interchangeable drugs when used in this setting.",

    "abstract": "Nervous system development is highly dependent on the function of microtubules, which are assembled from tubulin heterodimers containing several \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin isotypes encoded by separate genes. A spectrum of neurological disorders with malformations of the central nervous system has recently been associated with missense mutations in this group of genes. Here, we report two patients, monozygotic twins, carrying a de novo 0.32\u2009Mb deletion of chromosome 16q24.3 including the TUBB3 gene. The patients presented with global developmental delay, mild facial dysmorphism, secondary microcephaly, and mild spastic diplegia. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging of the patients did not reveal cortical malformations, malformations of the corticospinal tracts, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, or optic nerves. This observation is in contrast to the group of neurological disorders that are associated with heterozygous missense mutations in genes encoding different neuronal \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin isotypes, termed tubulinopathies. On the background of current knowledge regarding the function and genotype-phenotype correlations of mutations in the neuronal tubulin isotypes, the clinical and diagnostic findings in these patients are discussed. To our knowledge, this is the first report of patients with a de novo deletion of the TUBB3 gene. The lack of cortical or other cerebral malformations supports the current hypothesis that TUBB3-related tubulinopathies are caused by altered protein function.",

Targeted-NGS was performed using a custom designed Agilent HaloPlex target enrichment kit with Illumina Miseq sequencer. Identified potential pathogenic mutations were confirmed using Sanger sequencing. Clinical analyses were based on ophthalmic examination, fundus photography, and electroretinography (ERG). Results. Compound heterozygous GUCY2D mutations of novel splicing mutation c.2113+2_2113+3insT and novel missense mutation p.L905P were detected in both twins. Their father and mother were heterozygous for c.2113+2_2113+3insT and p.L905P, respectively. The twins had phenotypic features similar to those previously reported in patients with GUCY2D mutations. This included early childhood onset of visual loss, nystagmus, unrecordable ERG, photophobia, and hyperopia. Conclusions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of genetic and clinical features of Japanese LCA twins with GUCY2D mutation, which were detected using targeted-NGS.",

    "abstract": "This article is based on an in-depth interview with a pair of twins diagnosed with selective mutism and their parents 2\u2009years after recovery. Selective mutism (SM) is a rare disorder, and identical twins sharing the condition are extremely rare. The twins developed SM simultaneously during their first year of school. The treatment and follow-up they received for several years are briefly described in this article. The interview explored the children's and their parents' narratives about the origin of the condition, the challenges it entailed in their daily lives, and what they found helpful in the treatment they were offered. In the interview, the children conveyed experiences that even the parents were unaware of and revealed examples of daily life-traumas for which they were unable to obtain support and help. The whole family was trapped in the silence. The twins and their parents emphasized different aspects in terms of what they believed were helpful. The implications of these findings for our understanding and treatment of children with SM are discussed, as well as the potential of service user involvement in child and adolescent mental health research.",

Moreover, low BW has been linked to psychiatric disorders such as depression and psychological distress, and to altered neurocognitive profiles.\nWe present novel findings obtained by analysing high-resolution structural MRI scans of 48 twins; specifically, we aimed: i) to test the BW-SA association in a middle-aged adult sample; and ii) to assess whether either depression/anxiety disorders or intellectual quotient (IQ) influence the BW-SA link, using a monozygotic (MZ) twin design to separate environmental and genetic effects.\nBoth lower BW and decreased IQ were associated with smaller total and regional cortical SA in adulthood. Within a twin pair, lower BW was related to smaller total cortical and regional SA. In contrast, MZ twin differences in SA were not related to differences in either IQ or depression/anxiety disorders.\nThe present study supports findings indicating that i) BW has a long-lasting effect on cortical SA, where some familial and environmental influences alter both foetal growth and brain morphology; ii) uniquely environmental factors affecting BW also alter SA; iii) higher IQ correlates with larger SA; and iv) these effects are not modified by internalizing psychopathology.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein are commonly assessed biomarkers linked to illness, obesity, and stressful life events. However, relatively little is known about their heritability. By comparing Caucasian twins from the Midlife in the US project (MIDUS), we estimated the heritability of IL-6, its soluble receptor, and CRP. Based on the hypothesis that adiposity might contribute more to IL-6 than to sIL-6r, we fit heritability models quantifying the extent to which each reflected genetic and environmental factors shared with obesity. Genetic influences on IL-6 and its receptor proved to be distinct. Further, the appearance of a heritable basis for IL-6 was mediated largely via shared paths with obesity. Supporting this conclusion, we confirmed that when unrelated adult controls are carefully matched to twin participants on BMI, age, gender and socioeconomic indices, their IL-6 is similar to the corresponding twins. In contrast, the effect of BMI on CRP was split between shared genetics and environmental influences. In conclusion, IL-6 is strongly affected by factors associated with obesity accounting for its lability and responsiveness to diet, life style and contemporaneous events.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between different measures of obesity and chronic low back pain (LBP) using a within-pair twin case-control design that adjusts for genetics and early shared environment.\nA cross-sectional association between lifetime prevalence of chronic LBP and different measures of obesity (body mass index-BMI; percent body fat; waist circumference; waist-hip ratio) was investigated in 1128 female twins in three stages: (i) total sample analysis; (ii) within-pair case-control analysis for monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins together; (iii) within-pair case-control analysis separated by DZ and MZ. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.\nBMI (OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.02-1.26) and percent body fat (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.01-1.32) were weakly associated with lifetime prevalence of chronic LBP in the total sample analysis but were absent when shared environment and genetic factors were adjusted for using the within-pair case-control analysis. Greater waist-hip ratios were associated with smaller prevalence estimates of chronic LBP in the within-pair case-control analysis with both MZ and DZ twins (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.47-0.94). However, this association did not remain after the full adjustment for genetic factors in the MZ within-pair case-control analysis.\nBMI, percent of fat mass and greater depositions of fat and mass around the hips are associated with increases in chronic LBP prevalence in women but these associations are small and appear to be confounded by the effects of genetics and early shared environment. Therefore, our results do not support a causal direct relationship between obesity and chronic LBP.",

Greater waist-hip ratios were associated with smaller prevalence estimates of chronic LBP in the within-pair case-control analysis with both MZ and DZ twins (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.47-0.94). However, this association did not remain after the full adjustment for genetic factors in the MZ within-pair case-control analysis.",

    "abstract": "Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), the most frequent primary immunodeficiency characterized by loss of B-cell function, depends partly on genetic defects, and epigenetic changes are thought to contribute to its aetiology. Here we perform a high-throughput DNA methylation analysis of this disorder using a pair of CVID-discordant MZ twins and show predominant gain of DNA methylation in CVID B cells with respect to those from the healthy sibling in critical B lymphocyte genes, such as PIK3CD, BCL2L1, RPS6KB2, TCF3 and KCNN4. Individual analysis confirms hypermethylation of these genes. Analysis in naive, unswitched and switched memory B cells in a CVID patient cohort shows impaired ability to demethylate and upregulate these genes in transitioning from naive to memory cells in CVID. Our results not only indicate a role for epigenetic alterations in CVID but also identify relevant DNA methylation changes in B cells that could explain the clinical manifestations of CVID individuals.",

    "abstract": "To investigate and evaluate the pregnancy outcomes and fetal loss after fetal reduction of triplets to twins or singleton pregnancy.\n282 cases of triplets who received multi-fetal pregnancy reduction (MFPR) at Shandong Provincial Hospital affiliated to Shandong University were recruited from Sep 2001 to Mar 2014. According to the remaining fetal number after MFPR, 231 cases were opted to reduce to twins (twins group) while 51 cases were opted to singleton pregnancy (singleton group). The indication of the former group was fetal abnormalities under ultrasound or on patients' demand; while the indication for the later group included dichorionic triamniotic (DCTA) triplets or patients' aspiration. Potassium chloride was injected into the targeted fetal heart until cardiac standstill was obtained. The pregnancy outcomes, gestational age at delivery, birth weight of newborns of the two groups were recorded. Successful pregnancy was defined as take-home at least one baby.\n(1) The overall rate of successful pregnancy was 91.5% (258/282). There were 413 neonates in the twins group, including 4 neonatal deaths and 409 live babies, with the successful rate of 90.5% (209/231). There were 49 neonates in the singleton group, including 2 cases of fetal loss. Thus the successful rate was 96.1% (49/51). There was no difference of successful pregnancy rate between the two groups (P>0.05). (2) The mean gestational age at operation for the twins group and singleton group were (16.5\u00b13.5) weeks and (14.2\u00b12.0) weeks, respectively. Each group was divided into three periods, 11-13(+6) weeks, 14-16(+6) weeks and \u226517 weeks. In the twins group, the cases in each time period were 129 (55.8%, 129/231), 50 (21.6%, 50/231) and 52 (22.5%, 52/231), respectively. While in the singleton group, the cases in each time period were 27 (53%, 27/51), 16 (31%, 16/51) and 8 (16%, 8/51). There was no difference between the two groups at each time period (P>0.05). (3) The fetal loss rate in the twins group were 7% (9/129), 12% (6/50), 10% (5/52) at each time period, respectively. While for the singleton group they were 4% (1/27), 0 (0/16) and 1/8, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups at each time period (P>0.05). (4) The mean birth weight of the twins group was lower than the singleton group [(2,555\u00b1447) g vs (3,084\u00b1550) g, respectively, P<0.05]. The rates of low birth weight infants (<2,499 g) in the twins group and the singleton group were 45.5% (188/413) and 8% (4/49), respectively (P<0.05). The rate of very low birth weight infants (\u22641,499 g) was 3.9% (16/413) in the twins group compared with 0 (0/49) in the singleton group (P>0.05). (5) The gestational age at delivery of the twins group was earlier than the singleton group [(36.2\u00b12.4) weeks vs (38.3\u00b12.2) weeks, respectively, P<0.05]. The labor rate of the two groups was significantly different for both 34-36(+6) weeks and \u2265 37 weeks (P<0.05). The full-term delivery rate in the twins group was 47.6% (110/231), and was 88.2% (45/51) in the singleton group (P < 0.05). The fetal loss rate before 28 weeks did not differ between the two groups [8.7% (20/231) vs 3.9% (2/51), P>0.05].\nReduction to one fetus led to significantly better outcome than two fetuses, with no significant difference in fetal loss rate. It is better to advise patients with triplets reduce to singleton pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "There is great interest in blood-based markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially in its pre-symptomatic stages. Therefore, we aimed to identify plasma proteins whose levels associate with potential markers of pre-symptomatic AD. We also aimed to characterise confounding by genetics and the effect of genetics on blood proteins in general. Panel-based proteomics was performed using SOMAscan on plasma samples from TwinsUK subjects who are asymptomatic for AD, measuring the level of 1129 proteins. Protein levels were compared with 10-year change in CANTAB-paired associates learning (PAL; n = 195), and regional brain volumes (n = 34). Replication of proteins associated with regional brain volumes was performed in 254 individuals from the AddNeuroMed cohort. Across all the proteins measured, genetic factors were found to explain ~26% of the variability in blood protein levels on average. The plasma level of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) MAPKAPK5 protein was found to positively associate with the 10-year change in CANTAB-PAL in both the individual and twin difference context. The plasma level of protein MAP2K4 was found to suggestively associate negatively (Q < 0.1) with the volume of the left entorhinal cortex. Future studies will be needed to assess the specificity of MAPKAPK5 and MAP2K4 to eventual conversion to AD.",

    "abstract": "Presenting twins are less likely to develop respiratory complications than non-presenting twins. The precise reason for this difference is not well understood, although it is known that the presence of inflammation reduces the risk of respiratory morbidity at birth. To further investigate this association, we compared the concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers in mid-trimester amniotic fluid (AF) of asymptomatic twin pairs.\nThe study population consisted of women with twin pregnancies who underwent mid-trimester amniocentesis (15-20 weeks) for routine clinical indications and delivered at term. AF was analyzed for pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-12), and chemokines (Complement Factor D/Adipsin, Serpin E1/PAI-1, Adiponectin/Acrp30, CRP, CCL2/MCP-1, Leptin, Resistin) using Luminex Performance Assay multiplex kits. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test.\nA total of 82 twin pairs were enrolled. Mid-trimester AF concentrations of IL-8, MMP-8, CRP, MCP-1, leptin, and resistin were significantly higher in the presenting twin compared with the non-presenting twin (p<0.05 for each). Differences in AF concentrations of IL-8, MMP-8, and CRP persisted after adjustment for the fetal growth restriction at the time of birth and chorionicity.\nThese data suggest that, as early as the mid-trimester, the presenting fetus in an otherwise uncomplicated twin pregnancy is exposed to higher levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (especially IL-8, MMP-8, and CRP) than its non-presenting co-twin. Whether this pro-inflammatory milieu reduces the risk of neonatal respiratory morbidity at birth or has other functional implications needs to be further evaluated.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about why people differ in their levels of academic motivation. This study explored the etiology of individual differences in enjoyment and self-perceived ability for several school subjects in nearly 13,000 twins aged 9-16 from 6 countries. The results showed a striking consistency across ages, school subjects, and cultures. Contrary to common belief, enjoyment of learning and children's perceptions of their competence were no less heritable than cognitive ability. Genetic factors explained approximately 40% of the variance and all of the observed twins' similarity in academic motivation. Shared environmental factors, such as home or classroom, did not contribute to the twin's similarity in academic motivation. Environmental influences stemmed entirely from individual specific experiences.",

Here, we describe an anesthetic management approach for the separation of thoracopagus conjoined twins sharing parts of a congenitally defective heart and liver. We emphasize the importance of vigilant intraoperative hemodynamic monitoring for early detection of unexpected events. Specifically, real-time continuous monitoring of cerebral oximetry using near-infrared spectroscopy allowed us to promptly detect cardiac arrest and hemodynamic deterioration.",

    "abstract": "To further understand genetic factors that contribute to congenital cataracts, we sought to identify early post-twinning mutational and epigenetic events that may account for the discordant phenotypes of a twin pair.\nA patient with a congenital cataract and her twin sister were assessed for genetic factors that might contribute to their discordant phenotypes by mutation screening of 11 candidate genes (CRYGC, CRYGD, CRYAA, CRYAB, CRYBA1, CRYBB1, CRYBB2, MIP, HSF4, GJA3, and GJA8), exome analysis followed by Sanger sequencing of 10 additional candidate genes (PLEKHO2, FRYL, RBP3, P2RX2, GSR, TRAM1, VEGFA, NARS2, CADPS, and TEKT4), and promoter methylation analysis of five representative genes (TRAM1, CRYAA, HSF4, VEGFA, GJA3, DCT) plus one additional candidate gene (FTL).\nMutation screening revealed no gene mutation differences between the patient and her twin sister for the 11 candidate genes. Exome sequencing analysis revealed variations between the twins in 442 genes, 10 of which are expressed in the eye. However, these differential variants could not be confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Furthermore, epigenetic discordance was not detected in the twin pair.\nThe genomic DNA mutational and epigenetic events assessed in this study could not explain the discordance in the development of phenotypic differences between the twin pair, suggesting the possible involvement of somatic mutations or environmental factors. Identification of possible causes requires further research.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to cigarette smoking affects the epigenome and could increase the risk of developing diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders. Changes in DNA methylation associated with smoking may help to identify molecular pathways that contribute to disease etiology. Previous studies are not completely concordant in the identification of differentially methylated regions in the DNA of smokers. We performed an epigenome-wide DNA methylation study in a group of monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for smoking habits to determine the effect of smoking on DNA methylation. As MZ twins are considered genetically identical, this model allowed us to identify smoking-related DNA methylation changes independent from genetic components. We investigated the whole blood genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in 20 MZ twin pairs discordant for smoking habits by using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. We identified 22 CpG sites that were differentially methylated between smoker and non-smoker MZ twins by intra-pair analysis. We confirmed eight loci already described by other groups, located in AHRR, F2RL3, MYOG1 genes, at 2q37.1 and 6p21.33 regions, and also identified several new loci. Moreover, pathway analysis showed an enrichment of genes involved in GTPase regulatory activity. Our study confirmed the evidence of smoking-related DNA methylation changes, emphasizing that well-designed MZ twin models can aid the discovery of novel DNA methylation signals, even in a limited sample population.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number is an important component of mitochondrial function and varies with age, disease, and environmental factors. We aimed to determine whether mtDNA copy number varies with habitual differences in sleep duration within pairs of monozygotic twins.\nAcademic clinical research center.\n15 sleep duration discordant monozygotic twin pairs (30 twins, 80% female; mean age 42.1 years [SD 15.0]).\nSleep duration was phenotyped with wrist actigraphy. Each twin pair included a \"normal\" (7-9 h/24) and \"short\" (< 7 h/24) sleeping twin. Fasting peripheral blood leukocyte DNA was assessed for mtDNA copy number via the n-fold difference between qPCR measured mtDNA and nuclear DNA creating an mtDNA measure without absolute units. We used generalized estimating equation linear regression models accounting for the correlated data structure to assess within-pair effects of sleep duration on mtDNA copy number.\nMean within-pair sleep duration difference per 24 hours was 94.3 minutes (SD 62.6 min). We found reduced sleep duration (\u03b2 = 0.06; 95% CI 0.004, 0.12; P < 0.05) and sleep efficiency (\u03b2 = 0.51; 95% CI 0.06, 0.95; P < 0.05) were significantly associated with reduced mtDNA copy number within twin pairs. Thus every 1-minute decrease in actigraphy-defined sleep duration was associated with a decrease in mtDNA copy number of 0.06. Likewise, a 1% decrease in actigraphy-defined sleep efficiency was associated with a decrease in mtDNA copy number of 0.51.\nReduced sleep duration and sleep efficiency were associated with reduced mitochondrial DNA copy number in sleep duration discordant monozygotic twins offering a potential mechanism whereby short sleep impairs health and longevity through mitochondrial stress.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and uric acid (UA) using the twin study methodology to adjust for genetic factors.\nThe association between BMI and UA was investigated in a cross-sectional study using data from both monozygotic and dizygotic twins registered at the Osaka University Center for Twin Research and the Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine. From January 2011 to March 2014, 422 individuals participated in the health examination. We measured height, weight, age, BMI, lifestyle habits (Breslow's Health Practice Index), serum UA, and serum creatinine. To investigate the association between UA and BMI with adjustment for the clustering of a twin within a pair, individual-level analyses were performed using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). To investigate an association with adjustment for genetic and family environmental factors, twin-pair difference values analyses were performed.\nIn all analysis, BMI was associated with UA in men and women. Using the GLMMs, standardized regression coefficients were 0.194 (95\u00a0% confidence interval: 0.016-0.373) in men and 0.186 (95\u00a0% confidence interval: 0.071-0.302) in women. Considering twin-pair difference value analyses, standardized regression coefficients were 0.333 (95\u00a0% confidence interval: 0.072-0.594) in men and 0.314 (95\u00a0% confidence interval: 0.151-0.477) in women.\nThe present study shows that BMI was significantly associated with UA, after adjusting for both genetic and familial environment factors in both men and women.",

    "abstract": "We report on the influence of the duration of halogravity traction for achieving curve correction in monozygotic twins with Marfan syndrome who underwent posterior spinal fusion. Review of the medical charts and standard radiograph analysis of twin girls treated at our department was performed. Halogravity traction with a four-pin skull construct was applied for 3 weeks in twin A and for 2 weeks in twin B with a maximum of 20% body weight used. Both were on a 24-hours-day halogravity traction regime. Achieved thoracic curve correction after halogravity traction was 31% in twin A and 18% in twin B. Although less curve correction after traction was achieved in twin B, this had no significant implications on final postoperative curve correction. Halogravity traction can be a useful tool in the preoperative treatment of scoliosis in patients with Marfan syndrome if applied for 3 weeks. In order to avoid complications, we propose that lower weights be used with a starting weight of 1.5 kg increased by 1 kg daily until 20% body weight is reached.",

    "abstract": "Although membranous nephropathy (MN) is a commonly observed cause of post-transplant glomerulonephritis, distinguishing de novo from recurrent MN in kidney allograft is often difficult. Phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) staining is useful for diagnosing recurrent MN in allografts similarly to idiopathic MN in native kidney. No specific treatment strategy has been established for MN, especially when accompanied with HCV infection in kidney transplant recipients. This report describes a 66-year-old man who was diagnosed as having PLA2R positive membranous nephropathy accompanied with already-known IgA nephropathy and HCV infection 26 years after kidney transplantation conducted between identical twins. PLA2R was detected along capillary loops, implying that this patient is affected by the same pathogenic mechanism as idiopathic MN, not secondary MN associated with other disorders such as HCV infection. The patient successfully achieved clinical remission after steroid therapy.",

    "abstract": "To determine the neonatal outcome at late prematurity of uncomplicated monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies.\nA retrospective cohort study of 166 patients with uncomplicated MC diamniotic twins delivered between 34 and 37 weeks of gestation at a single tertiary center. The study population was classified into four groups according to the gestational age at delivery: (1) 34 weeks, (2) 35 weeks, (3) 36 weeks and (4) 37 weeks. Neonatal outcome measures were compared between the groups.\nNeonatal morbidity was significantly higher at 34 weeks of gestation compared to the other three groups including respiratory distress syndrome, oxygen requirement, hypothermia and hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, the rate of admission to the special care unit and need for phototherapy were significantly higher in newborns born at 36 weeks compared to 37 weeks of gestation (p = 0.02 and 0.03 respectively). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the risk for adverse neonatal outcome was significantly associated with gestational age at delivery. Of note, there were no fetal or neonatal deaths in our cohort.\nThe risk of neonatal morbidity of uncomplicated MC twins delivered at 34-37 weeks of gestation significantly decreases with advanced gestation. Therefore, under close fetal surveillance, uncomplicated MC twin pregnancies should be delivered at 37 weeks of gestation.",

Pulmonary involvement with signs of lung destruction (bullous emphysema) as first presentation is unusual. We report a case of monozygotic twins 37 years old men with occasional evidence of bullous emphysema with previously undiagnosed Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. We emphasize the importance of considering uncommon genetic causes of emphysema in young adults, discuss underlining pathophysiological mechanisms and propose a conservative management and follow-up.",

This report describes the fourth ever reported case of monozygotic twins with Klinefelter syndrome (who presented to our male fertility clinic with failure to conceive) and sheds interesting light on the reproductive concordance observed with this rare clinical entity. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of monozygotic twins with Klinefelter syndrome that describes the infertility workup and outcomes of microsurgical testicular sperm extraction.",

    "abstract": "To estimate the risk of spontaneous preterm birth in twin pregnancies based on transvaginal sonographic cervical length, fetal fibronectin (fFN) testing, and the gestational age at which these tests were performed.\nWomen with twin pregnancies, cervical length assessment, and fFN testing between 22 weeks and 31 weeks 6 days in a single maternal-fetal medicine practice from 2005 to 2013 were included. All testing was done on asymptomatic women on an out-patient basis. Women with monochorionic monoamniotic twins and twin-twin transfusion were excluded. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk of spontaneous preterm birth before 35, 32, and 28 weeks.\nSix hundred eleven patients were included and underwent a total of 2406 cervical length measurements and 2279 fFN tests over the course of the study period. The likelihood values for spontaneous preterm birth before 35, 32, and 28 weeks were 19.1%, 6.3%, and 2.3%, respectively. The risk of spontaneous preterm birth before 35 weeks increased with a decreasing cervical length (coefficient for the log of the odds ratio [OR coefficient], -0.13; P < .01; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.22 to -0.037), a positive fFN result (OR coefficient, 1.04; P < .01; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.64), as well as earlier gestational ages at testing (OR coefficient, -0.214; P < .01; 95% CI, -0.33 to -0.10). Similar results were seen for spontaneous preterm birth before 32 and 28 weeks.\nIn asymptomatic patients with twin pregnancies, the cervical length, fFN, and gestational age are all significantly associated with spontaneous preterm birth.",

    "abstract": "For over 100 years, the genetics of human anthropometric traits has attracted scientific interest. In particular, height and body mass index (BMI, calculated as kg/m2) have been under intensive genetic research. However, it is still largely unknown whether and how heritability estimates vary between human populations. Opportunities to address this question have increased recently because of the establishment of many new twin cohorts and the increasing accumulation of data in established twin cohorts. We started a new research project to analyze systematically (1) the variation of heritability estimates of height, BMI and their trajectories over the life course between birth cohorts, ethnicities and countries, and (2) to study the effects of birth-related factors, education and smoking on these anthropometric traits and whether these effects vary between twin cohorts. We identified 67 twin projects, including both monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, using various sources. We asked for individual level data on height and weight including repeated measurements, birth related traits, background variables, education and smoking. By the end of 2014, 48 projects participated. Together, we have 893,458 height and weight measures (52% females) from 434,723 twin individuals, including 201,192 complete twin pairs (40% monozygotic, 40% same-sex dizygotic and 20% opposite-sex dizygotic) representing 22 countries. This project demonstrates that large-scale international twin studies are feasible and can promote the use of existing data for novel research purposes.",

    "abstract": "Although researchers have recently demonstrated a relationship between oral health and arterial sclerosis, the genetic contribution to this relationship has been ignored even though genetic factors are expected to have some effect on various diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate oral health as a significant risk factor related to arterial sclerosis after eliminating genetic confounding through study of older Japanese twins.\nMedical and dental surveys were conducted individually for 106 Japanese twin pairs over the age of 50 years. Maximal carotid intima-media thickness (IMT-Cmax) was measured as a surrogate marker of arterial sclerosis. IMT-Cmax > 1.0 mm was diagnosed as arterial sclerosis. All of the twins were examined for the number of remaining teeth, masticatory performance, and periodontal status. We evaluated each measurement related with IMT-Cmax and arterial sclerosis using generalized estimating equations analysis adjusted for potential risk factors. For non-smoking monozygotic twins, a regression analysis using a \"between within\" model was conducted to evaluate the relationship between IMT-Cmax and the number of teeth as the environmental factor controlling genetic and familial confounding.\nWe examined 91 monozygotic and 15 dizygotic twin pairs (males: 42, females: 64) with a mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) age of 67.4 \u00b1 10.0 years. Out of all of the oral health-related measurements collected, only the number of teeth was significantly related to arterial sclerosis (odds ratio: 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.52-0.99 per five teeth). Regression analysis showed a significant association between the IMT-Cmax and the number of teeth as an environmental factor (p = 0.037).\nAnalysis of monozygotic twins older than 50 years of age showed that having fewer teeth could be a significant environmental factor related to arterial sclerosis, even after controlling for genetic and familial confounding.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a substantial health problem in the United States, and is associated with many chronic diseases. Previous studies have linked poor dietary habits to obesity. This cross-sectional study aimed to identify the association between body mass index (BMI) and fast-food consumption among 669 same-sex adult twin pairs residing in the Puget Sound region around Seattle, Washington. We calculated twin-pair correlations for BMI and fast-food consumption. We next regressed BMI on fast-food consumption using generalized estimating equations (GEE), and finally estimated the within-pair difference in BMI associated with a difference in fast-food consumption, which controls for all potential genetic and environment characteristics shared between twins within a pair. Twin-pair correlations for fast-food consumption were similar for identical (monozygotic; MZ) and fraternal (dizygotic; DZ) twins, but were substantially higher in MZ than DZ twins for BMI. In the unadjusted GEE model, greater fast-food consumption was associated with larger BMI. For twin pairs overall, and for MZ twins, there was no association between within-pair differences in fast-food consumption and BMI in any model. In contrast, there was a significant association between within-pair differences in fast-food consumption and BMI among DZ twins, suggesting that genetic factors play a role in the observed association. Thus, although variance in fast-food consumption itself is largely driven by environmental factors, the overall association between this specific eating behavior and BMI is largely due to genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "In the setting where two individuals are genetically similar, epigenetic mechanisms could account for discordance in the presence or absence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study investigated if serum microRNAs (miRs) could explain discordance in NAFLD.\nThis is a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort study of 40 (n=80) twin-pairs residing in Southern California. All participants underwent a standardised research visit, liver MRI using proton-density fat fraction to quantify fat content and miR profiling of their serum.\nAmong the 40 twin-pairs, there were 6 concordant for NAFLD, 28 were concordant for non-NAFLD and 6 were discordant for NAFLD. The prevalence of NAFLD was 22.5% (18/80). Within the six discordant twins, a panel of 10 miRs differentiated the twin with NAFLD from the one without. Two of these miRs, miR-331-3p and miR-30c, were also among the 21 miRs that were different between NAFLD and non-NAFLD groups (for miR-331-3p: 7.644\u00b10.091 vs 8.057\u00b10.071, respectively, p=0.004; for miR-30c: 10.013\u00b10.126 vs 10.418\u00b10.086, respectively, p=0.008). Both miRs were highly heritable (35.9% and 10.7%, respectively) and highly correlated with each other (R=0.90, p=2.2\u00d710(-16)) suggesting involvement in a common mechanistic pathway. An interactome analysis of these two miRs showed seven common target genes.\nUsing a novel human twin-study design, we demonstrate that discordancy in liver fat content between the twins can be explained by miRs, and that they are heritable.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies can be complicated. Early diagnosis with accurate dating, determination of chorionicity, screening for chromosomal and structural abnormalities, placental evaluation, and cervical length assessment should be completed in the first half of gestation. Routine fetal growth is recommended for all twins with serial surveillance for those complicated by anomalies, cervical shortening, growth disturbances, and amniotic fluid abnormalities. Twins with monochorionic placentation require heightened scrutiny for unequal placental sharing with discordant twin growth or selective intrauterine fetal growth restriction, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, twin anemia-polycythemia sequence, and single-fetal demise. Familiarity with essentials can assist practitioners involved in the management of twins.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies are prone to preterm birth and consequent morbidity. There is an increasing evidence base concerning the prediction and prevention of preterm birth in singletons, including the reduction of morbidity with therapies such as magnesium sulphate and antenatal corticosteroids. However, the research in twins is less clear, partly due to fewer numbers being investigated, but also evidence is largely based on twins without a previous history. Prophylactic interventions such as cerclage, progesterone and vaginal pessaries are increasingly showing benefit in singleton pregnancies with a prior history and when the cervix is short. Cerclage in twins has not been adequately researched in women with previous preterm birth, and as with singletons should not be used on the basis of a short cervix alone. Vaginal progesterone does not work in twins, but its value in high-risk twins, with a prior history and short cervix is uncertain. The vaginal pessary may be valuable in the twin with a short cervix. Currently, it is reasonable to extrapolate some of the evidence from singletons to twins, e.g. with antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium sulphate. Cerclage, vaginal pessaries and progesterone should not be routinely used in twin pregnancies without an additional high-risk factor such as prior history of preterm birth or short cervix, until further evidence is obtained.",

    "abstract": "Parental depressive symptoms are associated with emotional and behavioural problems in offspring. However, genetically informative studies are needed to distinguish potential causal effects from genetic confounds, and longitudinal studies are required to distinguish parent-to-child effects from child-to-parent effects.\nWe conducted cross-sectional analyses on a sample of Swedish twins and their adolescent offspring (n = 876 twin families), and longitudinal analyses on a US sample of children adopted at birth, their adoptive parents, and their birth mothers (n = 361 adoptive families). Depressive symptoms were measured in parents, and externalizing and internalizing problems measured in offspring. Structural equation models were fitted to the data.\nResults of model fitting suggest that associations between parental depressive symptoms and offspring internalizing and externalizing problems remain after accounting for genes shared between parent and child. Genetic transmission was not evident in the twin study but was evident in the adoption study. In the longitudinal adoption study child-to-parent effects were evident.\nWe interpret the results as demonstrating that associations between parental depressive symptoms and offspring emotional and behavioural problems are not solely attributable to shared genes, and that bidirectional effects may be present in intergenerational associations.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare the associations of crown-rump length (CRL) discrepancy with birthweight discordance in spontaneous versus in vitro fertilization (IVF) monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies.\nThis is a multicenter retrospective study on women with twin pregnancies assessed for nuchal translucency between January 1997 and July 2013. The study group was subdivided into MC twins conceived spontaneously and after IVF. Pregnancies with later fetal death or twin transfusion syndrome were excluded. A large-weight discordance was defined as a difference of birthweights of >15%.\nThe study group included 171 pregnancies; of them, 142 (83%) were spontaneous and 29 (17%) were IVF conceived. In the entire cohort, we found a significant correlation between birthweight discordance and CRL discrepancy (r\u2009=\u20090.173, P\u2009<\u20090.05). While a significant correlation was found between CRL discrepancy and birthweight discordance in spontaneous-conceived pregnancies (n\u2009=\u2009142, r\u2009=\u20090.24, P\u2009=\u20090.005), such correlation was not present in IVF pregnancies (n\u2009=\u200929, r\u2009=\u2009-0.7, P\u2009=\u20090.724). A logistic regression analysis found significant odds of larger-weight discordance for each increase of 1% in CRL discrepancy among spontaneously conceived pregnancies (odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.1, confidence interval\u2009=\u20091.03-1.2, P\u2009=\u20090.005). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) for large-weight discordance in the spontaneously conceived pregnancies demonstrated an area under the ROC curve of 0.613 (P\u2009=\u20090.039).\nThe significant correlation between CRL discrepancy and birthweight discordance in spontaneous versus IVF MC twin pregnancies might suggest differential monozygotic twinning process.",

    "abstract": "There is a considerable debate regarding the role of genetic and the environmental factors in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Since twin pairs are exposed to similar prenatal and postnatal environmental factors, a particular role of genetic vs. environmental factors can be evaluated by investigating the twins. We report a case of a dizygotic twin-pair who presented with simultaneous development of coronary insufficiency, and underwent coronary angiography and stent implantation on the same day. There were striking similarities and differences in certain characteristics between the presenting twins. We believe that the occurrence of CAD might be predetermined genetically, while the location of CAD lesion and its severity might be subjected to the modification of environmental factors among dizygotic twins. Considering the high risk of CAD-related fatal events in monozygotic and dizygotic twins, we recommend aggressive medical surveillance for a twin individual, whose co-twin has reported a cardiac event.",

    "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most frequent primary malignant bone tumor, if we exclude myeloma, a hematologic systemic disease. OS is relatively uncommon, with an estimated incidence of 600 cases per year in the United States. Among siblings is an even rarer phenomenon, with scattered reports throughout the English literature(1). We report the incidence of OS in identical twins. The first case is a low-grade OS arisen in the proximal tibia of a 25-year-old man, treated with en-bloc resection and reconstruction with allograft. The second one is a high-grade OS of the distal tibia of the 33-year-old twin, developed in a previous non-ossifying fibroma (NOF) followed over the time. The patient was treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, en-bloc resection and reconstruction with allograft. Our literature review did not find any case of OS in identical twins, while 26 reports of OS in siblings are described.",

Characteristics of sirenomelia are a single lower limb, sacral and pelvic bone defects, and anorectal and urogenital malformations. There is an increased incidence of sirenomelia in males and twins. This case was a preterm male, dizygotic twin and product of in vitro fertilisation. The baby was born by caesarean section due to breech presentation. He was found to have a fused lower extremity and absent external genitalia and anus. The baby passed away shortly after birth due to severe respiratory failure. Radiographic findings showed small lung volume and pneumothoraces. There were multiple segmental fusions of the vertebrae. Single femur and single tibia were presented in a fused lower limb. Autopsy demonstrated large intestinal atresia, intra-abdominal testes, absence of kidney, ureter and bladder, single umbilical artery, agenesis of blood vessels at lower extremity and agenesis of sacrum and coccyx.",

Under stratified analysis by region, results showed that the highest and lowest rates on heritability of BMI in men were seen in Tianjin and Zhejiang, as 67.8% (95% CI: 50.1%-85.8%) and 42.1% (95% CI: 27.2%-60.9%), while in women were seen in Sichuan and Heilongjiang as 56.2% (95% CI: 47.5%-70.0%) and 11.2% (95% CI: 0.0%-31.7%), respectively. Results from the stratified analysis showed that, by gender, the heritability of BMI in men was higher than that in women from the same region. The biggest differences of heritability of BMI between men and women were seen in Heilongjiang as 55.3% (95% CI: 35.5%-80.0%) and 11.2% (95% CI: 0-31.7%), while the smallest differences were seen in Sichuan as 61.5% (95% CI: 40.7%-86.4%) and 56.2% (95% CI: 47.5%-70.0%), respectively.\nThe heritability of BMI across different regions and genders showed certain differences in the Chinese twins.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are more prevalent in males, suggesting a multiple threshold liability model in which females are, on average, protected by sex-differential mechanisms. Under this model, autistic females are predicted to carry a more penetrant risk variant load than males and to share this greater genetic liability with their siblings. However, reported ASD recurrence rates have not demonstrated significantly increased risk to siblings of affected girls. Here, we characterize recurrence patterns in multiplex families from the Autism Genetics Resource Exchange (AGRE) to determine if risk in these families follows a female protective model.\nWe assess recurrence rates and quantitative traits in full siblings from 1,120 multiplex nuclear families and concordance rates in 305 twin pairs from AGRE. We consider the first two affected children per family, and one randomly selected autistic twin per pair, as probands. We then compare recurrence rates and phenotypes between males and females and between twin pairs or families with at least one female proband (female-containing (FC)) versus those with only male probands (male-only (MO)).\nAmong children born after two probands, we observe significantly higher recurrence in males (47.5%) than in females (21.1%; relative risk, RR\u2009=\u20092.25; adjusted P\u2009=\u20096.22e-08) and in siblings of female (44.3%) versus siblings of male probands (30.4%; RR\u2009=\u20091.46; adj. P\u2009=\u20090.036). This sex-differential recurrence is also robust in dizygotic twin pairs (males\u2009=\u200961.5%, females\u2009=\u200919.1%; RR\u2009=\u20093.23; adj. P\u2009=\u20097.66e-09). Additionally, we find a significant negative relationship between interbirth interval and ASD recurrence that is driven by children in MO families.\nBy classifying families as MO or FC using two probands instead of one, we observe significant recurrence rate differences between families harboring sex-differential familial liability. However, a significant sex difference in risk to children within FC families suggests that female protective mechanisms are still operative in families carrying high genetic risk loads. Furthermore, the male-specific relationship between shorter interbirth intervals and increased ASD risk is consistent with a potentially greater contribution from environmental factors in males versus higher genetic risk in affected females and their families. Understanding the mechanisms driving these sex-differential risk profiles will be useful for treatment development and prevention.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the pathogenesis of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains unclear. To investigate the genetic component of the disease, we performed whole genome sequencing on ALS discordant monozygotic twins. Illumina whole genome sequencing on white blood cell DNA of five ALS-discordant monozygotic twin pairs (10 samples in total) yielded \u223c30x coverage per individual. All single nucleotide variants, indels, and structural variants (copy number variants, inversions and translocations) were called and evaluated for functional consequence, evolutionary conservation, population frequency and overlap with known ALS associated variants and genes. Results showed that no validated discordant coding or regulatory single nucleotide variants or indels were found, and nor were any genome-wide discordant structural variants detected. Concordant variants of particular interest were: 1) two rare, highly-conserved heterozygous non-synonymous variants in SYT9 and EWSR1, genes previously associated with ALS (out of 2044 rare heterozygous variants detected); 2) three rare homozygous missense variants; and 3) three novel copy number deletions that overlapped genes. In conclusion, no convincing coding or regulatory nucleotide or genome-wide structural differences were found between ALS discordant monozygotic twins. The results suggest that more work is needed to elucidate possible environmental, epigenetic, oligogenic and somatic genetic factors that could underlie susceptibility to sporadic ALS.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the influences of host genotype and environment on Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum inhabiting human intestines at the strain level, six pairs of twins, divided into two groups (children and adults), were recruited. Each group consisted of two monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and one dizygotic (DZ) twin pair. Child twins had been living together from birth, while adult twins had been living separately for 5 to 10 years. A total of 345 B. longum subsp. longum isolates obtained from 60 fecal samples from these twins were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and 35 sequence types (STs) were finally acquired. Comparison of strains within and between the twin pairs showed that no strains with identical STs were observed between unrelated individuals or within adult DZ twin pairs. Eight STs were found to be monophyletic, existing within MZ twins and child DZ twins. The similarity of strain types within child cotwins was significantly higher than that within adult cotwins, which indicated that environment was one of the important determinants in B. longum subsp. longum strain types inhabiting human intestines. However, although these differences between MZ and DZ twins were observed, it is still difficult to reach an exact conclusion about the impact of host genotype. This is mainly because of the limited number of subjects tested in the present study and the lack of strain types tracing in the same twin pairs from birth until adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Late and early stressful factors have widely been recognized to play a role in the aetiology of depression. Recent research indicates that such adverse environmental stimuli may alter gene expression in humans via epigenetic modifications. While epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation are likely involved in these processes, it is still unknown what specific genomic loci may be hyper- or hypo-methylated in depression. The association between depressive symptoms during the last 30 days (Brief Symptom Inventory [BSI]) and peripheral-blood DNA methylation levels at genomic loci previously reported as epigenetically altered in saliva and brain of depressive patients was evaluated in a community sample of 34 adult Caucasian MZ twins (17 pairs). Intrapair DNA methylation differences in an intron of DEPDC7 (chr11:33040743) were associated with intrapair differences in current depressive symptoms. Accordingly, a site-specific 10% DNA hypomethylation in a co-twin would correlate with a current depressive symptom score around 3.1 BSI points above the score of his/her less-depressed co-twin. These findings indicate that DEPDC7 hypomethylation in peripheral blood DNA may be associated with recent depressive symptomatology, in line with previous results.",

    "abstract": "Growth deficiency, psychomotor delay, and facial dysmorphism was originally described in a male patient in 1989 by Wiedemann et al. and later in 2000 by Steiner et al. Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS) has since been described only a few times in the literature, with the phenotypic spectrum both expanding and becoming more delineated with each patient reported. We report on the clinical and molecular features of monozygotic twins with a de novo mutation in KMT2A. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray was done on both twins and whole-exome sequencing was done using both parents and one of the affected twins. SNP microarray confirmed that they were monozygotic twins. A de novo heterozygous variant (p. Arg1083*) in the KMT2A gene was identified through whole-exome sequencing, confirming the diagnosis of WSS. In this study, we have identified a de novo mutation in KMT2A associated with psychomotor developmental delay, facial dysmorphism, short stature, hypertrichosis cubiti, and small kidneys. This finding in monozygotic twins gives specificity to the WSS. The description of more cases of WSS is needed for further delineation of this condition. Small kidneys with normal function have not been described in this condition in the medical literature before.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and questionnaires-based method can be used for twin zygosity determination, but few validation studies have been conducted using Chinese populations. In the current study, we recruited 192 same sex Chinese adult twin pairs to evaluate the validity of using genetic markers-based method and questionnaire-based method in zygosity determination. We considered the relatedness analysis based on more than 0.6 million SNPs genotyping as the golden standards for zygosity determination. After quality control, qualified twins were left for relatedness analysis based on identical by descent calculation. Then those same sex twin pairs were included in the zygosity questionnaire validation analysis. Logistic regression model was applied to assess the discriminant ability of age, sex and the three questions in zygosity determination. Leave one out cross-validation was used as a measurement of internal validation. The results of zygosity determination based on 65 SNPs in 450k methylation array were all consistent with genotyping. Age, gender, questions of appearance confused by strangers and previously perceived zygosity consisted of the most predictable model with a consistency rate of 0.8698, cross validation predictive error of 0.1347. For twin studies with genotyping and\\or 450k methylation array, there would be no need to conduct other zygosity testing for the sake of costs consideration.",

    "abstract": "Depressive disorders have been shown to be highly influenced by environmental pathogenic factors, some of which are believed to exert stress on human brain functioning via epigenetic modifications. Previous genome-wide methylomic studies on depression have suggested that, along with differential DNA methylation, affected co-twins of monozygotic (MZ) pairs have increased DNA methylation variability, probably in line with theories of epigenetic stochasticity. Nevertheless, the potential biological roots of this variability remain largely unexplored. The current study aimed to evaluate whether DNA methylation differences within MZ twin pairs were related to differences in their psychopathological status. Data from the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip was used to evaluate peripheral blood DNA methylation of 34 twins (17 MZ pairs). Two analytical strategies were used to identify (a) differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and (b) variably methylated probes (VMPs). Most DMPs were located in genes previously related to neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Remarkably, one of these DMPs (cg01122889) was located in the WDR26 gene, the DNA sequence of which has been implicated in major depressive disorder from genome-wide association studies. Expression of WDR26 has also been proposed as a biomarker of depression in human blood. Complementarily, VMPs were located in genes such as CACNA1C, IGF2 and the p38 MAP kinase MAPK11, showing enrichment for biological processes such as glucocorticoid signaling. These results expand on previous research to indicate that both differential methylation and differential variability have a role in the etiology and clinical manifestation of depression, and provide clues on specific genomic loci of potential interest in the epigenetics of depression.",

    "abstract": "Recently, an intra-patient comparison demonstrated that the somatostatin (sst) ligand [(68)Ga]HA-DOTATATE ([(68)Ga]DOTA-3-iodo-Tyr(3)-octreotate) provides PET images comparable to or superior to those obtained with [(68)Ga]DOTATATE. To provide a comprehensive basis for nevertheless observed slight differences in tracer biodistribution and dosimetry, the characteristics of [(68)Ga]HA-DOTATATE were investigated in a detailed preclinical study.\nAffinities of (nat)Ga-HA-DOTATATE and (nat)Ga-DOTATATE to sst1-5 were determined using membrane preparations and [(125)I]SST-28 as radioligand. Internalization into AR42J cells was studied in dual-tracer studies with [(125)I]TOC as internal reference. Biodistribution was investigated using AR42J tumor-bearing CD1 mice, and specificity of tracer uptake was confirmed in competition studies by coinjection of 0.8\u00a0mg TOC/kg.\nSst2 affinities (IC50) of [(nat)Ga]HA-DOTATATE (1.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 nM, logP: -3.16) and [(nat)Ga]DOTATATE (1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 nM, logP: -3.69) were nearly identical. Both compounds displayed IC50\u2009>\u20091\u00a0\u03bcM for sst1,3,4, while sst5 affinity was markedly increased for (nat)Ga-HA-DOTATATE (102\u2009\u00b1\u200965 nM vs >1\u00a0\u03bcM for (nat)Ga-DOTATATE). [(nat)Lu]HA-DOTATATE and [(nat)Lu]DOTATATE showed slightly lower, identical sst2 affinities (2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6 and 2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 nM, respectively) and sst3 affinities of 93\u2009\u00b1\u20091 and 162\u2009\u00b1\u200916 nM. Internalization of [(68)Ga]HA-DOTATATE was tenfold higher than that of [(125)I]TOC but only sixfold higher for [(68)Ga]DOTATATE and [(177)Lu]HA-DOTATATE. While [(68)Ga]HA-DOTATATE and [(68)Ga]DOTATATE had shown similar target- and non-target uptake in patients, biodistribution studies in mice at 1\u00a0h post injection (n\u2009=\u20095) revealed slightly increased non-specific uptake of [(68)Ga]HA-DOTATATE in the blood, liver, and intestines (0.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3, 1.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2, and 4.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 %iD/g vs 0.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1, 0.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1, and 2.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 %iD/g for [(68)Ga]DOTATATE). However, sst-mediated accumulation of [(68)Ga]HA-DOTATATE in the pancreas, adrenals, and tumor was significantly enhanced (36.6\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3, 10.8\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2, and 33.6\u2009\u00b1\u200910.9 %iD/g vs 26.1\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0, 5.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4, and 24.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9 %iD/g, respectively). Consequently, tumor/background ratios for [(68)Ga]HA-DOTATATE in the AR42J model are comparable or slightly increased compared to [(68)Ga]DOTATATE.\nThe present preclinical data fully confirm the general biodistribution pattern and excellent in vivo sst-targeting characteristics previously observed for [(68)Ga]HA-DOTATATE in patients. The effect of slightly enhanced lipophilicity on background accumulation and normal organ dose is compensated by the high uptake of [(68)Ga]HA-DOTATATE in tumor. Thus, [(68)Ga]HA-DOTATATE represents a fully adequate, freely available substitute for [(68)Ga]DOTATATE and, given the superb sst-targeting characteristics of [(177)Lu]HA-DOTATATE in vitro, potential applicability for sst-targeted PRRT.",

    "abstract": "Male twin gestations exhibit higher incidence of fetal morbidity and mortality than singleton gestations. From an evolutionary perspective, the relatively high rates of infant and child mortality among male twins born into threatening environments reduce the fitness of these gestations, making them more vulnerable to fetal loss. Women do not perceive choosing to spontaneously abort gestations although the outcome may result from estimates, made without awareness, of the risks of continuing a pregnancy. Here, we examine whether the non-conscious decisional biology of gestation can be linked to conscious risk aversion. We test this speculation by measuring the association between household surveys in Sweden that gauge financial risk aversion in the population and the frequency of twins among live male births. We used time-series regression methods to estimate our suspected associations and Box-Jenkins modeling to ensure that autocorrelation did not confound the estimation or reduce its efficiency. We found, consistent with theory, that financial risk aversion in the population correlates inversely with the odds of a twin among Swedish males born two months later. The odds of a twin among males fell by approximately 3.5% two months after unexpectedly great risk aversion in the population. This work implies that shocks that affect population risk aversion carry implications for fetal loss in vulnerable twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "To understand the change trend of birth weight of twins in China from 1995 to 2012.\nA total of 10 827 twins born between 1995 and 2012 registered in national twin registry system in 8 provinces in China were included in this study. A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the change trend of twin's birth weight.\nMean birth weight of twins decreased by 0.01 kg every five years after adjusting sex, ovum type and place of birth (P = 0.041). The birth weight decreased both in superior twin and in inferior twin over time. After 2007, the birth weight of superior twin decreased by 0.008 kg each year, while the birth weight of inferior twin decreased by 0.014 kg each year. Mean relative difference in birth weight and birth weight discordant rate decreased before 2002, then increased from the lowest point 8.16% and 16.20% to highest point 9.99% and 22.40% respectively.\nThe birth weight of twins in China decreased between 1995 and 2012, while the birth weight discordant rate increased, suggesting that close attention should be paid to the discordance of twin body weight to reduce the risk of adverse health outcome.",

    "abstract": "The transmission of anxiety within families is well recognized, but the underlying processes are poorly understood. Twin studies of adolescent anxiety demonstrate both genetic and environmental influence, and multiple aspects of parenting are associated with offspring anxiety. To date, the children-of-twins design has not been used to evaluate the relative contributions of genetic transmission compared with direct transmission of anxiety from parents to their offspring.\nAnxiety and neuroticism measures were completed by 385 monozygotic and 486 dizygotic same-sex twin families (37% male twin pair families) from the Twin and Offspring Study in Sweden. Structural equation models tested for the presence of both genetic and environmental transmission from one generation to the next.\nFor both anxiety and neuroticism, the models provide support for significant direct environmental transmission from parents to their adolescent offspring. In contrast, there was no evidence of significant genetic transmission.\nThe association between parental and offspring anxiety largely arises because of a direct association between parents and their children independent of genetic confounds. The lack of genetic transmission may reflect there being different genetic effects on these traits in adolescence and adulthood. Direct environmental transmission is in line with developmental theories of anxiety suggesting that children and adolescents learn anxious behaviors from their parents through a number of pathways such as modeling. Future analyses should combine children-of-twins data with child twin data in order to examine whether this direct effect solely represents parental influences on the offspring or whether it also includes child/adolescent anxiety evoking parental anxiety.",

All twin pregnancies also carry additional maternal risks including pre-eclampsia, anaemia, antepartum haemorrhage, postpartum haemorrhage and operative delivery.The optimal timing for the delivery of monoamniotic twins is not known. The options include 'planned early delivery' between 32 and 34 weeks, or alternatively awaiting spontaneous labour at least up until the usual time of planned delivery for other monochorionic twins (approximately 36 to 38 weeks' gestation), unless there is a specific indication for earlier delivery.\nTo assess whether routine early delivery in monoamniotic twin pregnancies improves fetal, neonatal or maternal outcomes compared with 'expectant management'. Expectant management means awaiting spontaneous labour at least up until the usual time of planned delivery for other monochorionic twins (approximately 36 to 38 weeks' gestation in many centres), unless a specific indication for delivery occurs in the meantime, e.g. for non-reassuring antenatal testing.\nWe searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2015).\nPublished and unpublished randomised controlled trials (including cluster-randomised trials) comparing outcomes for women and infants who were randomised to planned early delivery of a monoamniotic twin pregnancy with outcomes for women and infants who were randomised to either planned term delivery or expectant management. However, we did not identify any trials for inclusion in this review.Quasi-randomised controlled trials, trials published in abstract form only, and trials using a cross-over design are not eligible for inclusion in this review.\nNo trials were identified by the search strategy.\nNo trials were identified by the search strategy.\nMonoamniotic twins are rare, and there is insufficient randomised controlled evidence on which to draw strong conclusions about the best management. In their absence, we can refer to historical case series and expert consensus. Management plans should take into consideration the availability of high-quality neonatal care if early delivery is chosen. Women and their families should be involved in the decision making about these high-risk pregnancies.Ongoing, multicentre audits of maternal and perinatal outcomes for monoamniotic twins are needed in order to inform families and clinicians about up-to-date perinatal outcomes with contemporary obstetric practice. Research should consider the social and economic implications of planned interventions, as well as the perinatal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Massive perivillous fibrin deposition (MFD) is a placental lesion of unknown etiology associated with perinatal morbidity and mortality and recurrence risk in subsequent pregnancies. We report a 34 weeks' gestation dizygotic twin pregnancy with discordancy for MFD and for intrauterine growth restriction after in vitro fertilization (IVF). Only the smaller twin corresponding to the placenta affected by MFD showed intrauterine growth restriction, with a weight below the 3rd percentile according to gestational age. The affected placenta showed a moderate increase in decidual lymphocytes. No difference in expression of complement factor C4d in umbilical veins could be observed. Development of MFD in one of the dizygotic placentas may be due to a pathologic immune response to one of the different fetal genotypes as semiallografts. The pathogenetic role of IVF as an environmental factor for development of MFD is unclear.",

    "abstract": "Most epigenetic studies in diabetes compare normal cells in \"high glucose\" (HG) to cells in \"normal glucose\" (NG) and cells returned from HG to NG. Here we challenge this approach.\nThe objective was to determine whether there were differences in gene expression in skin fibroblasts of monozygotic twins (MZT) discordant for type 1 diabetes (T1D).\nSkin fibroblasts were grown in NG (5.5 mmol/L) and HG (25 mmol/L) for multiple passages.\nThis study was conducted at the University of Minnesota.\nPatients were nine MZT pairs discordant for T1D.\nGene expression was assessed by mRNA-Seq, using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument. Pathway analysis tested directionally consistent group differences within the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways.\nA total of 3308 genes were differentially expressed between NG and HG in T1D MZT vs 889 in non-T1D twins. DNA replication, proteasome, cell cycle, base excision repair, homologous recombination, pyrimidine metabolism, and spliceosome pathways had overrepresented genes with increased expression in T1D twins with P values ranging from 7.21 \u00d7 10(-10) to 1.39 \u00d7 10(-4). In a companion article, we demonstrate that these pathway changes are related to diabetic nephropathy risk. There were no pathways statistically significant differently expressed in nondiabetic twins in HG vs NG.\nIn vivo exposure to diabetes alters cells in a manner that markedly changes their in vitro responses to HG. These results highlight the importance of using cells directly derived from diabetic patients for studies examining the effects of HG in diabetes.",

The current study administered a Pre-Adoption Adversity (PAA) Questionnaire to mostly American parents raising (a) adopted Chinese twins or (b) same-age unrelated adopted siblings. A goal was to replicate earlier analyses of pre-adoption adversity/adjustment among adopted preschool-age Chinese girls. A second goal was to conduct genetic analyses of four content areas (Developmental Delays at Adoption, Initial Adaptation to Adoption, Crying/Clinging, and Refusal/Avoidance) derived from the PAA Questionnaire. A key finding was that age at adoption added less than other predictors to adoptees' externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Family factors (e.g., parental education) contributed significantly to behavioral outcomes among the adopted Chinese twins. Genetic effects were indicated for all four content areas, with shared environmental effects evident for Developmental Delays at Adoption and Crying/Clinging. Future investigators should consider incorporating genetically sensitive designs into developmental research programs.",

Fetal weight was estimated using ultrasound biometric measurements combined using Hadlock's formula. Multilevel linear regression models were used to adjust for clustering by twin pregnancy and to account for the serial ultrasound measurements taken on each fetus. Based on this model, smoothed estimates of fetal weight were made for the third, 10th, 50th, 90th, and 97th percentiles of the fetal weight distribution. Fetal weight references were stratified by fetal chorionicity.\nA total of 642 twin fetuses with a total of 3078 ultrasound observations were included. Sixteen percent of the cohort was monochorionic. Fetal growth accelerated in the second trimester and continued in a linear pattern in the third trimester until term. As expected, the median weight for monochorionic twins was lighter than the median weight for dichorionic twins throughout pregnancy.\nThe reference values created in this study address serious methodological limitations of existing reference charts and thus provide an improved tool for assessing fetal growth in twin pregnancies. Importantly, dichorionic twins deviated from singleton reference charts at approximately 32 weeks, whereas monochorionic twins deviated at 28 weeks.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twinning is a rare congenital anomaly. Even after significant advancement in the health care delivery system in developing countries, adequate antenatal care of pregnant patients and antenatal diagnosis of congenital malformations by radiological techniques like sonogram need to be emphasized.\nA 25-year-old woman (G1P0) at 38 weeks' gestation vaginally delivered stillborn dicephalus male twins with 2 heads, 2 necks, and a common trunk with 2 arms and 2 legs at Kasturba Hospital. The fetuses were in breech presentation and were delivered using assisted breech vaginal delivery. The conjoint nature of the fetuses remained undiagnosed antenatally and was clinically unsuspected during the intrapartum period. It was only confirmed after delivery. The intrapartum and postpartum course was uncomplicated, and the patient was discharged home on postpartum day 2.\nThe diagnosis of conjoined twins can be missed without adequate antenatal care, leading to adverse fetomaternal outcome. Antepartum diagnosis of conjoined twins with sonography with or without MRI is essential for optimal obstetric and perinatal management, preoperative surgical planning, and parental counseling. Surgical separation of conjoined twins is possible in select cases and involves a multidisciplinary approach using several specialties.",

HCM causes variable symptoms and is one of the leading causes of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young adults. While various phenotypic features of HCM among monozygotic twin pairs are not uncommonly reported, occurrence of synchronous cardiac arrest among them is not known from literature.\nWe present a case of monozygotic twins with HCM who both had a cardiac arrest post physical exertion in 63rd year of their lives.\nThis case highlights potential genetics predisposition of cardiac arrest in patients with HCM despite having different phenotypic expression. SCD may be the only manifestation of patients with HCM. Decision of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement for primary prevention of SCD should be based on the recommended guidelines, clinical judgment and patient's preference.",

    "abstract": "Low socioeconomic status (SES), indicated by low income and education, has consistently been found to be a strong predictor of sick leave. Several possible pathways from SES to sick leave have been described in previous literature, but there are also evidence indicating that the association can be confounded by common underlying factors. This study utilizes a population-based sample of employed young adult twins to estimate (i) the degree to which education and income are prospectively related to sick leave granted for mental, somatic, and any disorder, and (ii) whether these associations are confounded by familial factors.\nRegistry data on educational attainment and income at age 30 and subsequent sick leave were available for 6,103 employed young adult twins, among which there were 2,024 complete twin pairs. The average follow-up time was 6.57\u00a0years. Individual-level associations and fixed effects within twin pairs were estimated.\nLow education and income were associated with sick leave granted for both mental and somatic disorders, and with sick leave granted for any disorder. Associations were attenuated within dizygotic twin pairs and reduced to non-significance within monozygotic twin pairs, suggesting influence of familial factors on the associations between SES and sick leave.\nLow SES is associated with a higher level of sick leave granted for both mental and somatic disorders among young adults, but these associations are confounded by factors that are common to co-twins. Education and income are therefore not likely to strongly affect sick leave in young adulthood.",

    "abstract": "We examine if there are genetic and environmental differences between mothers of singleton and multiple pregnancies in a sample of African-American mothers.\nWe focus on genomic areas suggested to increase or decrease the odds of multiple pregnancies. We computed the odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each SNP unadjusted or adjusted with smoking. SNPs' allelic differences between mothers of multiple pregnancies and singletons were also tested using Fisher's exact test. We considered additive terms for the SNPs' genotypes, smoking, and a multiplicative interaction term of two selected SNPs' genotypes.\nWe found significant interactions between smoking and SNPs of the CYP19A, MDM4, MTHFR and TP53 genes which correlated with higher odds of twinning. We also found a significant interaction between SNPs at the TP53 (rs8079544) and MTHFR gene (rs4846049), where the interaction between the homozygotes (TT for rs8079544, GG for rs4846049) correlated with lowered odds of multiple pregnancy.\nWe provide a mechanistic explanation and preliminary evidence for previous reports that mothers of twins are more likely to have smoked, despite seemingly conflicting evidence for the fertility-reducing effects of nicotine. Nicotine, as an aromatase inhibitor, inhibits estrogen synthesis and may allow for greater production of gonadotropins. While smoking may have deleterious effects on fertility across many genotypes, in women of specific genotypes it may raise their odds of producing twins. TP53 involvement suggests the necessity of future work examining relationships between women who bear multiples and cancer risk.",

Conjoined twins are complex complication of monozygotic twinning, which is associated with high perinatal mortality.\nAt our clinic complete anomaly scan was done, the patients was found to have monozygotic twins of 15 weeks gestation and carrying a conjoint twin. Our ultrasound revealed fully developed heads facing each other, joint at the thorax and sharing a common abdomen. These twins share a single heart with two atrium and two ventricle. They decide for termination of pregnancy after taken the opinion of religious people. Termination of pregnancy was performed by many methods and we chose to use cytotec tablets which inserted vaginally and the outcome was conjoint twin with two bodies fused from the upper thorax to lower belly. Both fetuses are female and died immediately after termination of pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare facial 3D analysis to DNA testing in twin zygosity determinations. Facial 3D images of 106 pairs of young adult Lithuanian twins were taken with a stereophotogrammetric device (3dMD, Atlanta, Georgia) and zygosity was determined according to similarity of facial form. Statistical pattern recognition methodology was used for classification. The results showed that in 75% to 90% of the cases, zygosity determinations were similar to DNA-based results. There were 81 different classification scenarios, including 3 groups, 3 features, 3 different scaling methods, and 3 threshold levels. It appeared that coincidence with 0.5 mm tolerance is the most suitable feature for classification. Also, leaving out scaling improves results in most cases. Scaling was expected to equalize the magnitude of differences and therefore lead to better recognition performance. Still, better classification features and a more effective scaling method or classification in different facial areas could further improve the results. In most of the cases, male pair zygosity recognition was at a higher level compared with females. Erroneously classified twin pairs appear to be obvious outliers in the sample. In particular, faces of young dizygotic (DZ) twins may be so similar that it is very hard to define a feature that would help classify the pair as DZ. Correspondingly, monozygotic (MZ) twins may have faces with quite different shapes. Such anomalous twin pairs are interesting exceptions, but they form a considerable portion in both zygosity groups.",

    "abstract": "To compare the outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and bipolar cord coagulation (BPC) methods for selective feticide in complicated monochorionic (MC) twin gestations and to determine risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of all patients with complicated MC twin pregnancy who underwent selective reduction in a single tertiary care center between 2000 and 2014. We compared the two methods with respect to various demographic, obstetric and perinatal outcome variables.\nFifty-three selective terminations in complicated MC twin gestations were performed, 36 by RFA and 17 by BPC. Each technique resulted in a similar overall survival rate of the remaining twin (88.9% vs 76.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.25). Likewise, the mean procedure-to-delivery interval, the rate of spontaneous preterm delivery <\u200937, <\u200934, <\u200932 and\u2009<\u200928 weeks and the rate of preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes did not differ between the groups. However, among patients in the BPC group, there was a trend towards earlier gestational age at delivery (31.3 vs 35.0\u2009weeks, P\u2009=\u20090.09) compared with in the RFA group. There was selective reduction by RFA due to selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) in 19 cases, 17 (89.5%) of which survived perinatally, with delivery at a median gestational age of 37 weeks. There were no significant differences in perinatal outcome, irrespective of whether the procedure was performed pre- or post-viability. All post-viability reductions, most of which were by RFA, resulted in perinatal survival.\nPerinatal outcome of complicated MC twin gestations undergoing selective feticide seems to be similar regardless of whether termination is by BPC or RFA. Nevertheless, RFA appears to be particularly useful in MC twins complicated by sIUGR and in cases requiring selective reduction beyond the age of viability.",

    "abstract": "The current epidemic of obesity and associated diseases calls for swift actions to better understand the mechanisms by which genetics and environmental factors affect metabolic health in humans. Monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs showing discordance for obesity suggest that epigenetic influences represent one such mechanism. We studied genome-wide leukocyte DNA methylation variation in 30 clinically healthy young adult MZ twin pairs discordant for body mass index (BMI; average within-pair BMI difference: 5.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u00a0kg/m(2)).\nThere were no differentially methylated cytosine-guanine (CpG) sites between the co-twins discordant for BMI. However, stratification of the twin pairs based on the level of liver fat accumulation revealed two epigenetically highly different groups. Significant DNA methylation differences (n\u2009=\u20091,236 CpG sites (CpGs)) between the co-twins were only observed if the heavier co-twins had excessive liver fat (n\u2009=\u200913 twin pairs). This unhealthy pattern of obesity was coupled with insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation. The differentially methylated CpGs included 23 genes known to be associated with obesity, liver fat, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome, and potential novel metabolic genes. Differentially methylated CpG sites were overrepresented at promoters, insulators, and heterochromatic and repressed regions. Based on predictions by overlapping histone marks, repressed and weakly transcribed sites were significantly more often hypomethylated, whereas sites with strong enhancers and active promoters were hypermethylated. Further, significant clustering of differentially methylated genes in vitamin, amino acid, fatty acid, sulfur, and renin-angiotensin metabolism pathways was observed.\nThe methylome in leukocytes is altered in obesity associated with metabolic disturbances, and our findings indicate several novel candidate genes and pathways in obesity and obesity-related complications.",

    "results": "There were no differentially methylated cytosine-guanine (CpG) sites between the co-twins discordant for BMI. However, stratification of the twin pairs based on the level of liver fat accumulation revealed two epigenetically highly different groups. Significant DNA methylation differences (n\u2009=\u20091,236 CpG sites (CpGs)) between the co-twins were only observed if the heavier co-twins had excessive liver fat (n\u2009=\u200913 twin pairs). This unhealthy pattern of obesity was coupled with insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation. The differentially methylated CpGs included 23 genes known to be associated with obesity, liver fat, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome, and potential novel metabolic genes. Differentially methylated CpG sites were overrepresented at promoters, insulators, and heterochromatic and repressed regions. Based on predictions by overlapping histone marks, repressed and weakly transcribed sites were significantly more often hypomethylated, whereas sites with strong enhancers and active promoters were hypermethylated. Further, significant clustering of differentially methylated genes in vitamin, amino acid, fatty acid, sulfur, and renin-angiotensin metabolism pathways was observed.",

    "abstract": "Telomere length, a highly heritable trait, is longer in offspring of older fathers. This perplexing feature has been attributed to the longer telomeres in sperm of older men and it might be an 'epigenetic' mechanism through which paternal age plays a role in telomere length regulation in humans. Based on two independent (discovery and replication) twin studies, comprising 889 twin pairs, we show an increase in the resemblance of leukocyte telomere length between dizygotic twins of older fathers, which is not seen in monozygotic twins. This phenomenon might result from a paternal age-dependent germ stem cell selection process, whereby the selected stem cells have longer telomeres, are more homogenous with respect to telomere length, and share resistance to aging.",

    "abstract": "To examine the association between early menarche and risk of post-menarcheal asthma.\nUsing data from two multidisciplinary questionnaire surveys, conducted eight years apart, we prospectively studied 10,648 female twins, 12-41 years of age, from the nationwide Danish Twin Registry. Early menarche was defined as menarche before 12 years of age. We performed a cohort analysis and a co-twin control analysis including twin pairs discordant for incident asthma.\nEarly menarche was observed in 9.3% of the individuals. The eight-year cumulative incidence of asthma was higher in girls with early menarche compared to girls without early menarche (7.4 vs. 4.5%), OR\u00a0=\u00a01.71 (1.31-2.22), p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; also after adjustment for BMI, current age, physical activity, education, and smoking, OR\u00a0=\u00a01.53 (1.15-2.04), p\u00a0=\u00a00.003. The unadjusted risk of asthma was increased by 8% (1-15%), p\u00a0=\u00a00.041 per year earlier menarche occurred. Among 167 twin pairs discordant for incident asthma, there was a non-significant tendency towards early menarche being more common in the asthmatic than the non-asthmatic co-twin (12.0 vs. 9.6%), OR\u00a0=\u00a01.57 (0.61-4.05), p\u00a0=\u00a00.350. The risk of asthma was not uniform in discordant monozygotic and dizygotic twins.\nEarly menarche is associated with increased risk of asthma among Danish female twins independently of BMI, age, physical activity, educational level and smoking. Results indicate a complex relationship possibly mediated through innate and non-genetic effects.",

There has been controversy over whether IVF is associated with adverse short- and long-term health outcomes of offspring. As with other prenatal factors, epigenetic change is thought to be a molecular mediator of any in utero programming effects. Most studies focused on DNA methylation at gene-specific and genomic level, with only a few on associations between DNA methylation and IVF. Using buccal epithelium from 208 twin pairs from the Peri/Postnatal Epigenetic Twin Study (PETS), we investigated associations between IVF and DNA methylation on a global level, using the proxies of Alu and LINE-1 interspersed repeats in addition to two locus-specific regulatory regions within IGF2/H19, controlling for 13 potentially confounding factors. Using multiple correction testing, we found strong evidence that IVF-conceived twins have lower DNA methylation in Alu, and weak evidence of lower methylation in one of the two IGF2/H19 regulatory regions and LINE-1, compared with naturally conceived twins. Weak evidence of a relationship between ICSI and DNA methylation within IGF2/H19 regulatory region was found, suggesting that one or more of the processes associated with IVF/ICSI may contribute to these methylation differences. Lower within- and between-pair DNA methylation variation was also found in IVF-conceived twins for LINE-1, Alu and one IGF2/H19 regulatory region. Although larger sample sizes are needed, our results provide additional insight to the possible influence of IVF and ICSI on DNA methylation. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date investigating the association of IVF and DNA methylation.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the association between the concentrations of immune-related proteins in mid-trimester amniotic fluid (AF) and the subsequent risk of spontaneous preterm delivery in twins.\nThe study population consisted of consecutive women with a twin pregnancy who underwent clinically indicated genetic amniocentesis at 15 to 20 weeks, and had a subsequent spontaneous delivery in the early preterm period (<32 weeks (cases)) or at term (37 to 42 weeks (controls)). AF was analyzed for cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1\u00df, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13 and IL-15, interferon-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-9 and MMP-12), and chemokines (complement factor-D/Adipsin, Serpin E1/PAI-1, Adiponectin/Acrp30, C-Reactive Protein, CCL2/MCP-1, Leptin, Resistin) using multiplex immunoassay kits. The association between AF protein levels and subsequent early preterm birth were examined.\nA total of 96 sets of twins were enrolled, including 17 early preterm birth cases and 79 term controls. AF concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, MMP-3, MMP-8 and MMP-9, and CCL2/MCP-1 were significantly higher in cases than controls. Among these analytes, the combination of AF IL-8 and MMP-9 values had the highest predictive value for early preterm birth. The risk was 8% (10/132) for IL-8<1200\u2009pg\u2009ml(-1) and MMP-9<1000\u2009pg\u2009ml(-1), 30% (15/50) for IL-8>1200\u2009pg\u2009ml(-1) or MMP-9>1000\u2009pg\u2009ml(-1), and 90% (9/10) for IL-8>1200\u2009pg\u2009ml(-1) and MMP-9>1000\u2009pg\u2009ml(-1) (P<0.001).\nHigh concentrations of IL-8 and MMP-9 in mid-trimester AF in twins predicted well the risk of early preterm birth.",

    "abstract": "We aim to elucidate causes of false-positive fetal RHD screening results obtained with cell-free DNA.\nFetal RHD screening was performed in 32,222 samples from RhD-negative women by multiplex real-time PCR in triplicate for RHD exons 5 and 7 using cell-free DNA isolated from maternal plasma obtained in the 27th gestational week. PCR results were compared with cord blood serology in 25,789 pregnancies (80.04%). False-positive cases were analyzed. Known biological causes (RHD variant genes), technical causes of discordance, and errors around blood sampling were investigated with leukocyte DNA from maternal and cord blood, and cell-free DNA from stored maternal plasma.\nNot only RHD but also Y-chromosome (DYS14) sequences were present in four plasma samples from RHD-negative women bearing an RHD-negative girl. Sample mix-up and other sampling errors could be excluded in three samples.\nThese results indicate that false-positive fetal RHD screening results can be caused by cell-free DNA fragments in maternal plasma derived from a third cell line that is not representative for either the maternal genome or the genome of the vital fetus. We propose that remaining (cyto)trophoblasts of a vanishing twin are the underlying mechanism, and we estimate a frequency of this phenomenon of 0.6%.",

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing interest in twin studies and the stunning amount of research on face recognition, the ability of adult identical twins to discriminate their own faces from those of their co-twins has been scarcely investigated. One's own face is the most distinctive feature of the bodily self, and people typically show a clear advantage in recognizing their own face even more than other very familiar identities. Given the very high level of resemblance of their faces, monozygotic twins represent a unique model for exploring self-face processing. Herein we examined the ability of monozygotic twins to distinguish their own face from the face of their co-twin and of a highly familiar individual. Results show that twins equally recognize their own face and their twin's face. This lack of self-face advantage was negatively predicted by how much they felt physically similar to their co-twin and by their anxious or avoidant attachment style. We speculate that in monozygotic twins, the visual representation of the self-face overlaps with that of the co-twin. Thus, to distinguish the self from the co-twin, monozygotic twins have to rely much more than control participants on the multisensory integration processes upon which the sense of bodily self is based. Moreover, in keeping with the notion that attachment style influences perception of self and significant others, we propose that the observed self/co-twin confusion may depend upon insecure attachment.",

These assumptions, by twins, their families and health professionals, along with the lack of universal zygosity testing for same-sex twins, has led to confusion within the twin community, yet little research has been conducted with twins about their understanding and assumptions about zygosity. We aimed to explore and quantify understanding and assumptions about zygosity using twins attending an Australian twin festival. We recruited 91 twin pairs younger than 18 years of age and their parents, and 30 adult twin pairs who were all uncertain of their zygosity, to complete one pen and paper questionnaire and one online questionnaire about their assumed zygosity, reasons for their assumptions and the importance of accurate zygosity knowledge. Responses were compared with their true zygosity measured using a genetic test. We found a substantial proportion of parents and twins had been misinformed by their own parents or medical professionals, and that knowledge of their true zygosity status provided peace of mind and positive emotional responses. For these reasons we propose universal zygosity testing of same-sex twins as early in life as possible and an increase in education of medical professionals, twins and families of twins about zygosity issues.",

    "abstract": "Children born with low gestational age (GA) or low birthweight (BW) are at increased risk of asthma. Twins as compared to singletons are on average more likely to be born with lower GA and BW and have been hypothesized to comprise a high-risk population for asthma. Many previous studies have not accounted for potential confounders or mediators.\nTo investigate the association between twinship and childhood asthma or early life wheeze and identify potential mediators, such as GA/BW.\nThe study population consisted of two cohorts including all children born in Sweden from 1 January 1993 to 1 June 2001 (n = 756,363 singletons, n = 22,478 twins) and 1 July 2005 to 31 December 2009 (n = 456,239 singletons, n = 12,872 twins). Asthma was defined using validated register-based outcomes of diagnosis or medication. The data were analysed using logistic (older cohort) and Cox regression (younger cohort). Adjusted models incorporated potential confounding or mediating factors including gestational age and birthweight.\nIn the younger cohort, the crude hazard ratio (HR) of asthma medication after 1.5 years of age was 1.12 (95% CI 1.01-1.23), and fully adjusted HR was 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.89. Crude HR of asthma diagnosis in the same age group was 1.14 (95% CI 0.99-1.30), fully adjusted 0.78 (0.68-0.98). Adjusted analyses in the older group yielded similar results.\nTwins were at significantly higher unadjusted risk of asthma or early life wheeze compared to singletons in the younger, but not in the older cohort. Associations attenuated following adjustment for GA/BW, suggesting that GA/BW mediates the effect of twinship on asthma risk. After adjustments, twins were at lower risk of asthma outcomes, possibly due to unmeasured confounding.",

    "abstract": "Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is associated with compromised signal transductions via PTH receptor (PTH-R) and other G-protein-coupled receptors including GHRH-R. To date, while GH deficiency (GHD) has been reported in multiple patients with PHP-Ia caused by mutations on the maternally expressed GNAS coding regions and in two patients with sporadic form of PHP-Ib accompanied by broad methylation defects of maternally derived GNAS differentially methylated regions (DMRs), it has not been identified in a patient with an autosomal dominant form of PHP-Ib (AD-PHP-Ib) accompanied by an STX16 microdeletion and an isolated loss of methylation (LOM) at exon A/B-DMR. We studied 5 4/12-year-old monozygotic twins with short stature (both -3.4 SD) and GHD (peak GH values, <6.0 \u03bcg/L after arginine and clonidine stimulations). Molecular studies revealed maternally derived STX16 microdeletions and isolated LOMs at exon A/B-DMR in the twins, confirming the diagnosis of AD-PHP-Ib. GNAS mutation was not identified, and neither mutation nor copy number variation was detected in GH1, POU1F1, PROP1, GHRHR, LHX3, LHX4, and HESX1 in the twins. The results, in conjunction with the previous finding that GNAS shows maternal expression in the pituitary, suggest that GHD of the twins is primarily ascribed to compromised GHRH-R signaling caused by AD-PTH-Ib. Thus, resistance to multiple hormones including GHRH should be considered in AD-PHP-Ib.",

    "abstract": "Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and their binding proteins (IGFBPs) are known to modulate fetal growth but their role in intrauterine growth of monochorionic twins (MCT) has not been studied.\nCord venous blood was collected directly after birth. IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 in the cord venous blood were quantified by radioimmunoassay. Birth weights (BWs) were obtained electronically. Placentas were examined for chorionicity.\nCord blood was collected in 37 pairs of MCT (15 pairs were males). BWs ranged from 564 to 3240 g, and gestational ages (GAs) were between 24 weeks and 39 weeks. There was a correlation between BW and cord venous blood IGFBP-3 concentration (r = 0.28, p = 0.015), but not between BW and cord venous blood IGF-1 level. There was no difference in IGF-1 between the heavier twins (30.8 \u00b1 61.8 ng/mL) and lighter twins (33.2 \u00b1 63.7 ng/mL), but a trend (p = 0.096) of higher IGFBP-3 level was demonstrated in heavier twins (3.14 \u00b1 1.23 \u03bcg/mL) than in lighter twins (2.71 \u00b1 1.19 \u03bcg/mL). The IGFBP-3 levels were higher (p = 0.042) in female twins (3.20 \u00b1 1.33 \u03bcg/mL) than in male twins (2.64 \u00b1 1.04 \u03bcg/mL). The IGF-1 level of the heavier twins correlated significantly to their lighter co-twin (r = 0.73, p < 0.001).\nOur data showed that cord venous blood IGF-1 level might be controlled mainly by genetic factors. IGFBP-3 might play an important role in fetal growth.",

    "abstract": "The influence of DNA repair capacity, plasma nutrients and tobacco smoke exposure on DNA methylation was investigated in blood cells of twenty-one couples of monozygotic twins with discordant smoking habits. All study subjects had previously been characterized for mutagen sensitivity with challenge assays with ionizing radiation in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Plasma levels of folic acid, vitamin B12 and homocysteine were also available from a previous investigation. In this work DNA methylation in the promoter region of a panel of ten genes involved in cell cycle control, differentiation, apoptosis and DNA repair (p16, FHIT, RAR, CDH1, DAPK1, hTERT, RASSF1A, MGMT, BRCA1 and PALB2) was assessed in the same batches of cells isolated for previous studies, using the methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting technique. Fairly similar profiles of gene promoter methylation were observed within co-twins compared to unrelated subjects (p= 1.23 \u00d7 10(-7)), with no significant difference related to smoking habits (p = 0.23). In a regression analysis the methylation index of study subjects, used as synthetic descriptor of overall promoter methylation, displayed a significant inverse correlation with radiation-induced micronuclei (p = 0.021) and plasma folic acid level (p = 0.007) both in smokers and in non-smokers. The observed association between repair of radiation-induced DNA damage and promoter methylation suggests the involvement of the DNA repair machinery in DNA modification. Data also highlight the possible modulating effect of folate deficiency on DNA methylation and the strong influence of familiarity on the individual epigenetic profile.",

    "abstract": "Mesiodens is the most common type of supernumerary tooth found in the premaxilla. It might be discovered by the clinical examination by chance on a radiograph or as the cause of an unerupted maxillary central incisor. The genetic transmission of supernumerary and impacted teeth is poorly understood. Mirror imaging in twins has been reported frequently in relation to several unilateral dental anomalies including mesiodens. This phenomenon is the appearance of an asymmetrical feature or anomaly occurring on the right side of one twin but on the left side of the other twin. The event of mesiodens mirror imaging in monozygotic twins has been described in literature.\nThis is the first reported case of mesiodens mirror images in dizygotic twins. The de-scribed mesiodens caused the eruption failure of maxillary permanent incisors. The super-numerary teeth were removed to facilitate the spontaneous eruption of the impacted perma-nent maxillary incisors.\nStudies related to supernumerary teeth can be useful to clinicians in the early diagnosis of this anomaly. Clinical and radiographic examinations provide a correct therapeutic approach. Key words:Supernumerary teeth, twins, dental development.",

    "abstract": "Purging disorder (PD) was recently included as an otherwise specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED) in the DSM-5; however, limited information is available on its prevalence, and its etiology is unknown.\nData from 1,790 monozygotic and 1,440 dizygotic European American female twins (age range = 18-29 years) from the Missouri Adolescent Female Twin Study were used to investigate prevalence and familial influences for PD. A structured clinical interview assessed lifetime DSM-IV criteria for eating disorders and PD. After adjustment for age, twin correlations and biometrical twin models were used to estimate familial (i.e., genetic plus shared environmental) influences on PD.\nOne hundred and twenty one (3.77%; 95% CI: 3.14, 4.49) women met criteria for lifetime PD. Twin correlations suggested that genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environmental factors influenced liability to PD. Nonshared environmental factors accounted for 56% [35%, 79%] of the variance in PD. Although familial effects accounted for a significant proportion of variance (44% [21%, 65%]), it was not possible to disentangle the independent contributions of additive genetic effects (20% [0%, 65%]) and shared environmental effects (24% [0%, 57%]).\nPD is a prevalent form of eating pathology. Familial factors are relevant to the development of PD but do not demonstrate the magnitude of heritable factors found for other eating disorders.",

    "abstract": "There are 4 types of preaxial polydactyly (PPD), and type I (PPD-I), also known as thumb duplication, is the most common. This frequently encountered condition has since been further described and classified by Wassel based on the level of duplication of skeletal anatomy. Genetic studies have localized possible candidate gene(s) for PPD types II to IV to the chromosomal region 7q36 but the current literature attributes PPD-I to isolated, spontaneous mutations typically with unilateral involvement only. Recent epidemiological studies have also suggested nongenetic causes for PPD-I including social and environmental factors. Herein, we would like to present a case of discordant PPD-I expression affecting the same hand in a pair of monozygotic twins and suggest possible reasons for this presentation because previous similar reports only had involvement of 1 child.",

    "abstract": "Current literature provides little information about the impact of environmental exposures on the severity of acquired blepharoptosis.\nThe authors assessed environmental factors that may contribute to eyelid ptosis in a population of identical twins.\nPhotographs of 286 sets of twins from a prospectively collected database from 2008 to 2010 were reviewed. The authors identified 96 sets of identical twins (192 individual persons) who had differing severity of ptosis. Digital photographs were analyzed, and the degree of ptosis was measured in each eye of every subject. The external factors that could potentially contribute to blepharoptosis were taken into consideration. The authors then assessed the correlations of 9 different environmental risk factors with ptosis. Generalized linear mixed model were constructed to determine the associations of ptosis measurements with environmental risk factors obtained from the subject survey database.\nThe mean level of upper eyelid ptosis in the study population was 1.1 mm. The mean difference in ptosis between twins was 0.5 mm. Wearing contact lenses, either hard or soft, was significantly associated with ptosis. The mean ptosis measurement among twins who did not wear contact lenses was 1.0 mm; for those who wore soft contact lenses, the mean was 1.41 mm, and for those who wore hard contact lenses, the mean was 1.84 mm.\nAcquired ptosis is not linked to body mass index, smoking behavior, sun exposure, alcohol use, work stress, or sleep. Wearing either hard or soft lenses was associated with an increased risk of ptosis. These influences are independent of genetic predisposition.\n3 Diagnostic.",

In total, 139 monozygotic and 95 dizygotic twin pairs aged from 5 to 18 years were recruited. The twin correlations of total hand and wrist scores for monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins were 0.71 and 0.36, respectively. Bivariate model analysis showed moderate genetic correlations only for total skeletal maturity vs. weight and total skeletal maturity vs. waist circumference (r, 0.51 and 0.46, respectively).

    "abstract": "To determine whether isolated abnormal Doppler indices before 28 weeks predict adverse pregnancy outcomes in uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins.\nA retrospective cohort study of MCDA twin pregnancies receiving antenatal testing at a single center between 2007 and 2013 was conducted. Sonographic surveillance, including Doppler velocimetric studies of the umbilical artery, ductus venosus, and middle cerebral artery of each twin, was initiated by 28 weeks and repeated at least every 2 weeks. All pregnancies were deemed \"uncomplicated\" at initial sonography, without evidence of polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction, twin growth discordance of at least 20%, structural or chromosomal anomalies, or unclear chorionicity. Pregnancies were divided into 2 groups: those with isolated Doppler abnormalities before 28 weeks and those with normal Doppler indices. The primary outcome was a composite including twin-twin transfusion syndrome, intrauterine growth restriction of more than 1 twin, growth discordance of at least 20%, preterm delivery before 34 weeks for fetal indications, or demise of more than 1 fetus.\nNinety-six patients were included, with 22 (22.9%) having isolated Doppler abnormalities before 28 weeks. The incidence of the primary outcome did not differ between groups (36.4% versus 28.4%; P = .47). The abnormal Doppler group underwent a greater number of sonographic examinations (15 versus 10; P= .001) and more antenatal admissions for fetal concerns (50.0% versus 12.2%; P < .001).\nIsolated Doppler abnormalities are commonly encountered in uncomplicated MCDA pregnancies before 28 weeks yet are not clearly predictive of twin-specific complications. Doppler abnormalities were associated with increased sonographic surveillance and antenatal hospitalizations, suggesting an influence on physician practice patterns. Data may not support Doppler studies before 28 weeks for routine MCDA twin monitoring.",

Examination of the visual acuity demonstrated 20/40 in his each eye. Biomicroscopy showed bilaterally central corneal subepithelial opacities and some dot opacities in the superficial stroma. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography demonstrated most hyperreflective opacities at the subepithelial layer with some interspersed opacities in the superficial stroma. Confocal microscopy revealed irregular hyperreflective materials in the Bowman layer and the superficial stroma. Several rough filaments were found in the middle layer of stroma, corresponding to a feature of amyloid lattice. The corneas of his parents and dizygotic sister were clear. Sequencing of the TGFBI gene revealed an R124C mutation in the affected boy but not in his three healthy family members.\nA de novo R124C mutation of the TGFBI gene may occur in one of dizygotic twins. Patients with an R124C mutation may have clinical features like corneal dystrophy of the Bowman layer. Confocal microscopy can be used to detect subclinical lattice lines, thereby facilitating differential diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic bone disease (MBD) is one of the important complications of prematurity. Early and adequate nutritional interventions may reduce the incidence and potential complications of MBD. The present study aimed to evaluate bone metabolism in twins via biochemical parameters and quantitative ultrasound (QUS) and to compare the results between twin pairs. Moreover, twin infants were evaluated in terms of potential risk factors likely to have impact on MBD. Forty-three pairs of twins were included in the study. Serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and alkaline phosphatase concentrations were assessed and bone mineral density was measured using QUS (speed of sound, SOS) at postnatal 30\u2009d. Co-twin with the higher birth weight was assigned to Group 1 (n\u2009=\u200936) and the other twin was assigned to Group 2 (n\u2009=\u200936). Birth weight and head circumference were significantly higher in the infants of Group 1 compared with Group 2. No significant difference was found among the groups in terms of gender, history of resuscitation, length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) or in the incubator, duration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), type of nutrition, vitamin D use, biochemical parameters, and the SOS value. The factors likely to affect SOS, including type of pregnancy, maternal drug use, gender of infant, birth weight, head circumference at birth, gestational week, length of stay at the ICU, duration of TPN, type of nutrition, resuscitation, vitamin D use, and levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and alkaline phosphatase were entered into the model. The phosphorus level and the maternal drug use were found to be the factors that significantly reduced SOS, whereas pregnancy after assisted reproductive techniques was found to be a significant enhancing factor.",

    "abstract": "Music performance depends critically on precise processing of time. A common model behavior in studies of motor timing is isochronous serial interval production (ISIP), that is, hand/finger movements with a regular beat. ISIP accuracy is related to both music practice and intelligence. Here we present a study of these associations in a large twin cohort, demonstrating that the effects of music practice and intelligence on motor timing are additive, with no significant multiplicative (interaction) effect. Furthermore, the association between music practice and motor timing was analyzed with the use of a co-twin control design using intrapair differences. These analyses revealed that the phenotypic association disappeared when all genetic and common environmental factors were controlled. This suggests that the observed association may not reflect a causal effect of music practice on ISIP performance but rather reflect common influences (e.g., genetic effects) on both outcomes. The relevance of these findings for models of practice and expert performance is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Body mass index (BMI) discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins allow an examination of the causes and consequences of adiposity in a genetically controlled design. Few studies have examined longitudinal BMI discordance in MZ pairs.\nThe aim of this work was to study the development over time of BMI discordance in adolescent and adult MZ twin pairs and to examine lifestyle, metabolic, inflammatory and gene expression differences associated with concurrent and long-term BMI discordance in MZ pairs.\nBMI data from 2775 MZ twin pairs, collected in eight longitudinal surveys and a biobank project between 1991 and 2011, were analyzed to characterize longitudinal discordance. Lifestyle characteristics were compared within discordant pairs (\u0394BMI\u2a7e3\u2009kg\u2009m(-2)) and biomarkers (lipids, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and soluble IL-6 receptor and liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and gamma glutamyl transferase) and gene expression were compared in peripheral blood from discordant pairs who participated in the Netherlands Twin Register biobank project.\nThe prevalence of discordance ranged from 3.2% in 1991 (mean age=17, s.d.=2.4) to 17.4% (N=202 pairs) in 2009 (mean age=35, s.d.=15) and was 16.5% (N=174) among pairs participating in the biobank project (mean age=35, s.d.=12). Of the 699 MZ pairs with BMI data from 3 to 5 time points, 17 pairs (2.4%) were long-term discordant (at all available time points; mean follow-up range=6.4 years). Concurrently discordant pairs showed significant differences in self-ratings of which twin eats most (P=2.3 \u00d7 10(-13)) but not in leisure time exercise activity (P=0.28) and smoking (P>0.05). Ten out of the 14 biomarkers showed significantly more unfavorable levels in the heavier of twin of the discordant pairs (P-values <0.001); most of these biomarker differences were largest in longitudinally discordant pairs. No significant gene expression differences were identified, although high ranking genes were enriched for Gene Ontology terms highlighting metabolic gene regulation and inflammation pathways.\nBMI discordance is uncommon in adolescent identical pairs but increases with higher pair-mean of BMI at older ages, although long-term BMI discordance is rare. In discordant pairs, the heavier twin had a more unfavorable blood biomarker profile than the genetically matched leaner twin, in support of causal effects of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Children vary markedly in their tendency to behave prosocially, and recent research has implicated both genetic and environmental factors in this variability. Yet, little is known about the extent to which different aspects of prosociality constitute a single dimension (the prosocial personality), and to the extent they are intercorrelated, whether these aspects share their genetic and environmental origins. As part of the Longitudinal Israeli Study of Twins (LIST), mothers of 183 monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) 7-year-old twin pairs (51.6% male) reported regarding their children's prosociality using questionnaires. Five prosociality facets (sharing, social concern, kindness, helping, and empathic concern) were identified. All five facets intercorrelated positively (r > 0.39) suggesting a single-factor structure to the data, consistent with the theoretical idea of a single prosociality trait. Higher MZ than DZ twin correlations indicated genetic contributions to each prosociality facet. A common-factor-common-pathway multivariate model estimated high (69%) heritability for the common prosociality factor, with the non-shared environment and error accounting for the remaining variance. For each facet, unique genetic and environmental contributions were identified as well. The results point to the presence of a broad prosociality phenotype, largely affected by genetics; whereas additional genetic and environmental factors contribute to different aspects of prosociality, such as helping and sharing.",

    "abstract": "The relative importance of genetic and environmental influences on obesity-related phenotypes remains unclear, and few studies have targeted the Chinese population. Here, we used Chinese twins reared apart and together to explore genetic and environmental influences on body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and waist-height ratio (WHtR), further to differentiate phenotype heritability between different age groups and genders separately and to differentiate influences of rearing environment and correlated environment. Phenotype heritability was calculated using the structural equation model in 11,401 twin pairs aged 25-85 years. BMI (0.70, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.74) of the total population was highly heritable, while WC (0.53, 95 %CI 0.50-0.57) and WHtR (0.48, 95 %CI 0.45-0.51) were moderately heritable. Age and gender stratified analyses found higher heritability in the younger group and males than the older group and females. The correlated environment had a greater influence on the phenotypes than the rearing environment, especially on WC and WHtR, indicating that more correlated environment actions should be taken to prevent the rising trend of abdominal obesity.",

    "abstract": "In singletons, asthma may be associated with shorter height and delayed growth during adolescence. Yet, these studies do not account for heritability of asthma, puberty/menarche, and height. We aimed to study the association between asthma and puberty in boys and menarche in girls, and height, in a cohort of twins and subsequently in same-sex twin pairs discordant for asthma. From a Swedish twin cohort, parent- and self-reported data on asthma, puberty/menarche, and height were collected. Pubertal staging was established via the Petersen index. Logistic and linear regression was used to estimate associations between asthma and puberty/menarche and height, respectively. For within-pair analyses in twins discordant for asthma, conditional logistic and linear regression were used. Data on 2,658 (49.1% boys) twins were included. Among boys, asthma prevalence was 8.2% at 8-9 years and 10.2% at 13-14 years. Corresponding numbers for girls were 4.2% and 4.9%, respectively. In the entire cohort, no statistically significant associations were found between current asthma and puberty/menarche. Boys with asthma were shorter than boys without asthma at 8-9 years (on average, 1.86 [0.17-3.56] cm, p = .03) and at 13-14 years (on average, 2.94 [0.98-4.91] cm, p = .003) but not at 19-20 years. No such associations were found for girls. Within same-sex twin pairs discordant for asthma, no statistically significant associations were found for either sex. Twin boys, but not girls, with asthma were shorter than those without asthma. Non-statistically significant estimates from within-pair analyses suggest the association is partly confounded by genetic or familial environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to examine the changes in DNA methylation of gene promoters associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The DNA methylation profile dataset GSE38291 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. A paired t-test was used to analyze differences in the DNA methylation of gene promoters between T2D and normal muscle samples. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed using online tool, The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. Whole-Genome rVISTA was used to analyze the enriched transcription factor (TF) binding sites upstream of the transcription start site in the differentially methylated genes. A total of 38 genes, including Sirtuin 1, N-acetyltransferase 6, phospholipase A2 group XIIB and nuclear factor of activated T cells calcineurin-dependent 1, were identified to be differentially methylated between these two groups. One GO term, DNA geometric change (GO:0032392), was significantly enriched (P<0.05) by the hyper-methylated genes. In addition, the binding sites of one gene, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1, and three TFs, methyl CpG binding protein 2, TFEB and TFAP4, were significantly enriched in the hyper- and hypo-methylated genes, respectively. The resulting T2D\u2011associated genes and potential TFs provided a novel insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology of T2D. These genes may become promising target genes for the development of treatments for T2D.",

    "abstract": "We describe a comprehensive molecular analysis of a pair of monozygotic twins, who came to our attention when one experienced amaurosis fugax and was diagnosed with JAK2+ polycythaemia vera. He (Twin A) was also found to have an asymptomatic B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). Although JAK2-, Twin B was subsequently shown to have a benign monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). Flow cytometric and molecular analyses of the B-cell compartments revealed different immunoglobulin light and heavy chain usage in each twin. We hypothesized that whole exome sequencing could help delineating the pattern of germline B-cell disorder susceptibility and reveal somatic mutations potentially contributing to the differential patterns of pre-malignancy. Comparing bone marrow cells and T cells and employing in-house engineered integrative analysis, we found aberrations in Twin A consistent with a myeloid neoplasm, i.e. in TET2, RUNX1, PLCB1 and ELF4. Employing the method for detecting high-ranking variants by extensive annotation and relevance scoring, we also identified shared germline variants in genes of proteins interacting with B-cell receptor signalling mediators and the WNT-pathway, including IRF8, PTPRO, BCL9L, SIT1 and SIRPB1, all with possible implications in B-cell proliferation. Similar patterns of IGHV-gene usage to those demonstrated here have been observed in inherited acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Collectively, these findings may help in facilitating identification of putative master gene(s) involved in B-cell proliferations in general and MBL and B-CLL in particular.",

    "abstract": "In a study of 1,310 Finnish adult male twins we found that sexual interest in children aged 12 or younger was reported by 0.2% of the sample. Sexual interest in children aged 15 or younger was reported by 3.3%. Participants reporting sexual interest in children aged 15 or younger were younger, reported stronger sexual desire, and had experienced more childhood sexual and nonsexual abuse. The present study is the first to give a population-based estimate of the incidence of sexual interest in children among adult men. The 12-month incidence of sexual interest in children below the age of 16 years is roughly comparable to the one-year incidence of major depression or the lifetime prevalence of transvestitic fetishism.",

    "abstract": "Twins reared apart provide a fascinating experiment to distinguish genetic from environmental influences. However, there is as yet no broad report on distribution of twins reared apart, especially in the Chinese population. In this study, information on 18,295 volunteer twin pairs of all age groups was compiled in nine provinces or cities of China, and questionnaires were used for zygosity determination. It was discovered that twins reared apart from 0 to 10 years of age accounted for 2.2% of all twin interviewees, with the proportion of this 0-10 group separated before 1, 2, and 5 years old, accounting for 65.3%, 76.1%, and 91.3%, respectively. The proportion of twins reared apart is not significantly related to zygosity or gender, but it is related to region and twin age. As the age of twins lowers, the proportion of those reared apart gradually decreases. Twins reared apart will become rarer in the future and therefore should be cherished as a resource.",

    "abstract": "Shorter telomere length (TL) has found to be associated with lower birth weight and with lower cognitive ability and psychiatric disorders. However, the direction of causation of these associations and the extent to which they are genetically or environmentally mediated are unclear. Within-pair comparisons of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins can throw light on these questions. We investigated correlations of within pair differences in telomere length, IQ, and anxiety/depression in an initial sample from Brisbane (242 MZ pairs, 245 DZ same sex (DZSS) pairs) and in replication samples from Amsterdam (514 MZ pairs, 233 DZSS pairs) and Melbourne (19 pairs selected for extreme high or low birth weight difference). Intra-pair differences of birth weight and telomere length were significantly correlated in MZ twins, but not in DZSS twins. Greater intra-pair differences of telomere length were observed in the 10% of MZ twins with the greatest difference in birth weight compared to the bottom 90% in both samples and also in the Melbourne sample. Intra-pair differences of telomere length and IQ, but not of TL and anxiety/depression, were correlated in MZ twins, and to a smaller extent in DZSS twins. Our findings suggest that the same prenatal effects that reduce birth weight also influence telomere length in MZ twins. The association between telomere length and IQ is partly driven by the same prenatal effects that decrease birth weight.",

Next, papers and studies concerning the biological bases of monozygotic (MZ) twinning, gestational diabetes and post-partum depression are reviewed. Finally, general interest reports of rare quadruplets, mistaken identity, prenatal laser surgery and a royal twin birth are provided.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins can be co-identified by genotyping of short tandem repeats (STRs); however, for distinguishing them, STR genotyping is ineffective, especially in the case of murder. Here, a rarely occurring tri-allelic pattern in the vWA locus (16, 18, 19) was identified only in the DNA of one identical twin, which could help to exonerate the innocent twin in a murder charge. This mutation was defined as primary through genotyping of the family and could be detected in blood, buccal and semen samples from the individual; however, two alternative allele-balanced di-allelic patterns (16, 18 or 16, 19) were detected in hair root sheath cells. Such a kind of segregation indicates a one-step mutation occurs in cell mitosis, which is after embryonic zygote formation and during the early development of the individual after the division of the blastocyte. Sequencing revealed the insertion between the allele 18 and 19 is a repeat unit of TAGA/TCTA (plus/minus strand), which belongs to \"AGAT/ATCT\"-based core repeats identified from all tri-allelic pattern reports recorded in the STR base and a detailed model was proposed for STR repeat length variation caused by false priming during DNA synthesis. Our model illustrates the possible origination of allele-balanced and unbalanced tri-allelic pattern, clarifies that the genotypes of parent-child mismatches, aberrant di-allelic patterns, and type 1 or 2 tri-allelic patterns should be considered as independent, but interconnected forms of STR mutation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present article was to study the prevalence and the heritability of the initiation of breastfeeding in the Netherlands. The study was carried out in 5,581 participants from the Netherlands Twin Register, and included female twins, their sisters and mothers. All of the participants were born between 1911 and 1991. Breastfeeding was self-reported by the participants, and its prevalence was estimated conditional on birth cohort (born before 1955, 1955-1964, 1965-1974, 1975, or later). To estimate the heritability, we conducted extended twin-family modeling using the SEM package OpenMx in R. Mothers of twins had lower prevalence to initiate breastfeeding and the prevalence of initiation of breastfeeding increased with birth cohort: among mothers of twins 66% in the oldest (pre-1955) to 74% in the youngest (post-1974) and among mothers, who were twins themselves or sisters of twins, 79% in the oldest (pre-1955) to 85% in the youngest (post-1974). When accounting for prevalence differences between mothers of twins and other women, heritability of initiation of breastfeeding was 70%. However, the familial resemblance for sister and mother-daughter pairs was clearly lower than for DZ twin pairs, but as the number of non-twin sisters was relatively low, this observation did not lead to a significant contribution of a special shared twin environment.",

    "abstract": "Despite an increasing recognition that psychiatric disorders can be diagnosed as early as preschool, little is known how early genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders during this very early period of development.\nWe assessed infant temperament at age 1, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and separation anxiety disorder (SAD) at ages 3 through 5 years in a sample of Hispanic twins. Genetic, shared, and non-shared environmental effects were estimated for each temperamental construct and psychiatric disorder using the statistical program MX. Multivariate genetic models were fitted to determine whether the same or different sets of genes and environments account for the co-occurrence between early temperament and preschool psychiatric disorders.\nAdditive genetic factors accounted for 61% of the variance in ADHD, 21% in ODD, and 28% in SAD. Shared environmental factors accounted for 34% of the variance in ODD and 15% of SAD. The genetic influence on difficult temperament was significantly associated with preschool ADHD, SAD, and ODD. The association between ODD and SAD was due to both genetic and family environmental factors. The temperamental trait of resistance to control was entirely accounted for by the shared family environment.\nThere are different genetic and family environmental pathways between infant temperament and psychiatric diagnoses in this sample of Puerto Rican preschool age children.",

The incidence of conjoined twins is estimated to be around 1 in 250,000 live births with a female predilection. We presented an extremely rare case of abdomino-thoracopagus with single heart and liver. In this paper, the imaging of conjoined twins both antenatally and postnatally is reviewed, in particular taking into consideration recent advances with gray scale and color Doppler ultrasound. This case is of particular interest because of the rarity of abdomino-thoracopagus twins with single heart and liver, in literature.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to compare neonatal mortality and morbidity in very preterm twins with the first twin in cephalic presentation in hospitals with a policy of planned vaginal delivery (PVD) and those with a policy of planned cesarean delivery (PCD).\nWomen with preterm cephalic first twins delivered after preterm labor and/or premature preterm rupture of membranes from 26(0/7) to 31(6/7) weeks of gestation were identified from the databases of 6 perinatal centers and classified as PVD or PCD according to the center's management policy from 1999 to 2010. Severe neonatal morbidity was defined as any of the following: intraventricular hemorrhage grades 3-4, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and hospital death. The independent effect of the planned mode of delivery, defined by the center's management policy, was tested and quantified with a 2-level multivariable logistic regression.\nThe PVD group included 248 women, and the PCD group 63. Maternal characteristics did not differ between the 2 groups. The rate of vaginal delivery was 85.9% (213 of 248) vs 20.6% (13 of 63) (P < .001), and the rate of cesarean delivery for the second twin was 1.6% (4 of 248) vs 4.8% (3 of 63) (P = .13) for PVD and PCD. PVD had no independent effect on either newborn hospital mortality or severe neonatal composite morbidity.\nA policy of planned vaginal delivery of very preterm twins with the first twin in cephalic presentation does not increase either severe neonatal morbidity or mortality.",

    "abstract": "Allo-anti-M often has an immunoglobulin G (IgG) component but is rarely clinically significant. We report a case of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn along with prolonged anemia in newborn twins that persisted for up to 70 days postbirth. The aim was to diagnose and successfully manage hemolytic disease of newborn (HDN) due to maternal alloimmunization. Direct antiglobulin test (DAT), antigen typing, irregular antibody screening and identification were done by polyspecific antihuman globulin cards and standard tube method. At presentation, the newborn twins (T1, T2) had HDN with resultant low reticulocyte count and prolonged anemia, which continued for up to 70 days of life. Blood group of the twins and the mother was O RhD positive. DAT of the both newborns at birth was negative. Anti-M was detected in mothers as well as newborns. Type of antibody in mother was IgG and IgM type whereas in twins it was IgG type only. M antigen negative blood was transfused thrice to twin-1 and twice to twin-2. Recurring reduction of the hematocrit along with low reticulocyte count and normal other cell line indicated a pure red cell aplastic state. Anti-M is capable of causing HDN as well as prolonged anemia (red cell aplasia) due to its ability to destroy the erythroid precursor cells. Newborns with anemia should be evaluated for all the possible causes to establish a diagnosis and its efficient management. Mother should be closely monitored for future pregnancies as well.",

    "abstract": "To explore the effects of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) on children's growth by the study of identical twins.\nSeventeen cases of nonobese children with OSAS were included in this study. The control group was their identical twin sibling, who had no signs of OSAS. Data including height, weight, and serum insulin-like growth factor 1 levels were analyzed before tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (T&A) and at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery.\nThe mean apnea hyponea index was 3.9 times/hour in patients with OSAS and became normal after surgery. Minimum oxygen saturation gradually increased after T&A. The height and weight of the OSAS group before T&A was lower than the control group. During the follow-up period, height and weight increased but were lower than the control group. Serum insulin-like growth factor 1 levels in the OSAS group before T&A were lower than the control group. The level was significantly increased 3 months after T&A.\nOSAS impairs growth and development. Significant growth recovery occurs after T&A, and early surgical intervention is an important factor for improvement in growth.",

    "abstract": "The quality of services provided to families of twins with special needs [SPNs] was examined in a US-based study. Participants included 30 parents with monozygotic (n=8) or dizygotic (n=22) twin pairs. Parents completed questionnaires containing quantitative and qualitative components addressing the circumstances and challenges surrounding their twins' diagnoses. Areas of unmet concerns included contact withother parents, respite care and grief counseling. Beneficial services included early interventions (e.g., occupational and physical therapy). Several resources were identified as not providing sufficient benefit (e.g., inadequate state resources). These findings underline the need to improve methods by which knowledge and support are disseminated to parents regarding diagnostic information and service availability.

The primary outcome was the rate of cesarean delivery.\nTwo trials (271 women) were analyzed. Women with twin gestations who had planned delivery at 37 weeks had similar rates of cesarean delivery compared to controls [51.9 versus 49.3%; relative risk (RR): 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83-1.32]. Furthermore, no differences in all secondary outcomes were detected, except for a significantly lower rate of serious adverse infant outcomes in the women who had planned delivery at 37 weeks compared to controls (4.7 versus 12.2%; RR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.20-0.76).\nPlanned delivery at 37 weeks in twins is associated with a similar risk of cesarean delivery and lower risk of serious adverse infant outcomes, compared to expectant management until at least 38 weeks.",

    "abstract": "Homosexuality is a stable population-level trait in humans that lowers direct fitness and yet is substantially heritable, resulting in a so-called Darwinian \"paradox.\" Evolutionary models have proposed that polymorphic genes influencing homosexuality confer a reproductive benefit to heterosexual carriers, thus offsetting the fitness costs associated with persistent homosexuality. This benefit may consist of a \"sex typicality\" intermediate phenotype. However, there are few empirical tests of this hypothesis using genetically informative data in humans.\nThis study aimed to test the hypothesis that common genetic factors can explain the association between measures of sex typicality, mating success, and homosexuality in a Western (British) sample of female twins.\nHere, we used data from 996 female twins (498 twin pairs) comprising 242 full dizygotic pairs and 256 full monozygotic pairs (mean age 56.8) and 1,555 individuals whose co-twin did not participate. Measures of sexual orientation, sex typicality (recalled childhood gender nonconformity), and mating success (number of lifetime sexual partners) were completed.\nVariables were subject to multivariate variance component analysis.\nWe found that masculine women are more likely to be nonheterosexual, report more sexual partners, and, when heterosexual, also report more sexual partners. Multivariate twin modeling showed that common genetic factors explained the relationship between sexual orientation, sex typicality, and mating success through a shared latent factor.\nOur findings suggest that genetic factors responsible for nonheterosexuality are shared with genetic factors responsible for the number of lifetime sexual partners via a latent sex typicality phenotype in human females. These results may have implications for evolutionary models of homosexuality but are limited by potential mediating variables (such as personality traits) and measurement issues.",

    "abstract": "Colored-sequence synesthesia (CSS) is a neurological condition in which sequential stimuli such as letters, numbers, or days of the week trigger simultaneous, involuntary color perception. Although the condition appears to run in families and several studies have sought a genetic link, the genetic contribution to synesthesia remains unclear. We conducted the first comparative twin study of CSS and found that CSS has a pairwise concordance of 73.9% in monozygotic twins, and a pairwise concordance of 36.4% in dizygotic twins. In line with previous studies, our results suggest a heritable element of synesthesia. However, consonant with the findings of previous single-pair case studies, our large sample size verifies that synesthesia is not completely conferred by genetics; if it were, monozygotic twins should have 100% concordance. These findings implicate a genetic mechanism of CSS that may work differently than previously thought: collectively, our data suggest that synesthesia is a heritable condition with incomplete penetrance that is substantially influenced by epigenetic and environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests that individuals with schizophrenia have an underlying vulnerability to cardiovascular disease, and a recent study suggested that this vulnerability might be reflected in the retinal microvasculature. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the retinal microvessels reflect familial vulnerability to psychotic symptoms. Participants were 531 adolescent and young adult twins who took part in the Brisbane Longitudinal Twin Study and the Twins Eye Study in Tasmania. The twins had photographs taken of their retina when they were adolescents or young adults (M age=20.6 years), and retinal vessel diameter was assessed using computer software. The twins completed an assessment of psychosis symptoms approximately six years later. We compared retinal venular diameters of individuals with one or more symptoms of psychosis (n=45), their unaffected co-twins (n=24), and controls (n=462). Individuals with one or more symptoms of psychosis had wider venules (standardized mean=0.29) than controls (standardized mean=-0.04; p=.03), and unaffected co-twins had venular diameters that were intermediate (standardized mean=0.13) between the two groups, suggesting that wide venules may represent a proxy marker of familial vulnerability to psychosis symptoms. Consistent with previous work, there were no differences in arteriolar diameter between individuals with and without symptoms of psychosis. Findings suggest that wide retinal venules may serve as a proxy marker of familial liability to psychosis symptoms. The pathophysiological mechanisms linking psychosis and cardiovascular disease may be operative from early in life, possibly at the level of the microvasculature.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to investigate the perinatal outcomes of monoamniotic twins under current standards of prenatal management involving intensive fetal surveillance.\nThe incidence of perinatal mortality in monoamniotic twins has fallen over the last 2 decades. Umbilical cord entanglement has long been considered one of the main causes of poor outcome among monoamniotic twins; however, new evidence shows that it appears to be less important than prematurity and congenital anomalies. If intensive fetal surveillance is provided, the risk of perinatal mortality is acceptably low regardless of setting. In uncomplicated monoamniotic twin pregnancies, delivery at around 33 weeks of gestation might reduce the risk of neonatal adverse events without increasing the risk of perinatal death.\nPerinatal outcome in monoamniotic twins improved if intensive fetal surveillance was performed under either outpatient or inpatient management. Planned delivery in uncomplicated monoamniotic twin pregnancies can be considered at around 33 weeks of gestation.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined sibling influence over reactive and proactive aggression in a sample of 452 same-sex twins (113 male dyads, 113 female dyads). Between and within siblings influence processes were examined as a function of relative levels of parental coercion and hostility to test the hypothesis that aggression contagion between twins occurs only among dyads who experience parental coerciveness. Teacher reports of reactive and proactive aggression were collected for each twin in kindergarten (M\u2009=\u20096.04 years; SD\u2009=\u20090.27) and in first grade (M\u2009=\u20097.08 years; SD\u2009=\u20090.27). Families were divided into relatively low, average, and relatively high parental coercion-hostility groups on the basis of maternal reports collected when the children were 5 years old. In families with relatively high levels of parental coercion-hostility, there was evidence of between-sibling influence, such that one twin's reactive aggression at age 6 predicted increases in the other twin's reactive aggression from ages 6 to 7, and one twin's proactive aggression at age 6 predicted increases in the other twin's proactive aggression from ages 6 to 7. There was also evidence of within-sibling influence such that a child's level of reactive aggression at age 6 predicted increases in the same child's proactive aggression at age 7, regardless of parental coercion-hostility. The findings provide new information about the etiology of reactive and proactive aggression and individual differences in their developmental interplay.",

    "abstract": "While health literacy has been widely considered key to patient empowerment, an alternative approach separates both concepts and distinguishes between different types of patients according to their levels of health literacy and empowerment. These types are deemed to vary in their health-related actions and outcomes. In this study, we examine the relationship between health literacy and patient empowerment and compare socio-demographic characteristics, health-related activities, and health outcomes in four types of patients suffering from chronic low back pain (cLBP).\nIn a cross-sectional study, 273 cLBP patients from four Swiss cantons (Vaud, Geneva, Fribourg, Ticino) and Lombardy (Italy) were invited by their healthcare providers to complete a self-administered paper-and-pencil questionnaire which assessed patients' health literacy, empowerment, involvement in the medical encounter, medication non-adherence, and perceived pain and functionality as a measure of health outcomes.\nHealth literacy and patient empowerment were not significantly correlated with each other, r(271) = .09, p > .05, allowing to differentiate between four types of patients based on their levels of health literacy and patient empowerment. Subsequent chi-square tests and analyses of variances revealed significant differences among patients that could, however, only be attributed to health literacy, as in the case of age and educational attainment, or patient empowerment, as in the case of patients' involvement in the medical encounter. No significant differences were evident for gender, medication non-adherence, and health outcomes.\nThe study provides empirical evidence for the need to consider health literacy and patient empowerment as independent concepts in the context of cLBP but calls for further studies to be able to conclude on how the two concepts interact and determine health-related activities and outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Although the co-occurrence of low back pain (LBP) and depression is common, the nature of this association remains unclear. We aimed to investigate whether symptoms of depression are associated with LBP after adjusting for various confounders, including genetics. We used cross-sectional data from 2148 twins from the Murcia Twin Registry, Spain. All twins answered questions about lifetime prevalence of LBP (outcome variable) and symptoms of depression, collected through two instruments, deriving 3 measures: (1) self-report feelings of depression and anxiety; (2) state depression, and (3) trait depression. First, associations were investigated using logistic regression analysis of the total sample. We performed subsequent matched within-pair twin case-control analyses with all complete twin pairs discordant for LBP regardless of zygosity, and separately for dizygotic and monozygotic pairs. This sequential analysis allows for more precise estimates of the relationship between variables, as in each step, the impact of early shared environment and genetics is further considered. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with higher prevalence of LBP in the total sample analysis (odds ratio [OR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31-2.05), and this relationship was stronger in the subsequent case-control analysis (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.13-2.69) and dizygotic case-control analysis (OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.39-4.08) but disappeared when the analysis was conducted for monozygotic twins (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.42-2.05). A similar pattern was found for state and trait depression. The depression-LBP relationship disappears when high levels of control for confounding factors are applied and seems to be driven by genetic or environmental factors that influence both conditions.",

    "abstract": "Although short tandem repeat profiling is extremely powerful in identifying individuals from crime scene stains, it is unable to differentiate between monozygotic (MZ) twins. Efforts to address this include mutation analysis through whole genome sequencing and through DNA methylation studies. Methylation of DNA is affected by environmental factors; thus, as MZ twins age, their DNA methylation patterns change. This can be characterized by bisulfite treatment followed by pyrosequencing. However, this can be time-consuming and expensive; thus, it is unlikely to be widely used by investigators. If the sequences are different, then in theory the melting temperature should be different. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess whether high-resolution melt curve analysis can be used to differentiate between MZ twins. Five sets of MZ twins provided buccal swabs that underwent extraction, quantification, bisulfite treatment, polymerase chain reaction amplification and high-resolution melting curve analysis targeting two markers, Alu-E2F3 and Alu-SP. Significant differences were observed between all MZ twins targeting Alu-E2F3 and in four of five MZ twins targeting Alu-SP (P<0.05). Thus, it has been demonstrated that bisulfite treatment followed by high-resolution melting curve analysis could be used to differentiate between MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "Because of shared characteristics, pathological gambling (PG) has been variously conceptualized as an obsessive-compulsive (OC) spectrum disorder or as an addictive disorder. Prior community-based studies have not systematically determined the association between PG and OC features and whether common genetic factors contribute to both conditions.\nTo examine the association and genetic correlation between PG and OC features.\nWe performed a latent class analysis (LCA) of OC features, cross-sectional tests of association, and classic twin genetic analysis using results of telephone interviews conducted from March 2002 through November 2003. Participants included 1675 male twin pairs from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, aged 45 to 60 years.\nTen OC features were queried and used to derive OC classes identified via LCA.\nThe best-fitting LCA model identified the following 4 OC classes: unaffected (class 1), ritual/symmetry compulsions (class 2), germ/contamination obsessions (class 3), and severe OC (class 4). All PG symptoms were more common in class 4 OC and 6 of 10 PG symptoms were significantly more common in class 4 OC (P\u2009<\u2009.01). Participants in the severe class were most likely to have 4 or more DSM-IV or DSM-5 PG diagnostic criteria (odds ratio, 3.8 [95% CI, 1.8-8.2]). The genetic correlation between phenotypes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.16-0.75).\nThe association between OC features and diagnostic criteria for PG highlights a role of obsessions and compulsivity in PG, and the lifetime co-occurrence of these disorders results in part from common genetic variance. Phenotypic and genetic overlap between OC features and PG add to our understanding of the most appropriate classification of PG and offers insights for treatment development.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to assess the non-genetic contribution to the associations between the change in weight and changes in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. This analysis included 194 Korean monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs (116 men, 272 women; mean age, 38.5 \u00b1 6.8 years) who were first examined for weight and CVD risk factors (blood pressure (BP), glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL)) between December 2005 and December 2008, and returned for a repeat examination after 2.7 \u00b1 0.9 years. The within-pair correlations were 0.21 for the change in weight and 0.05-0.42 for the changes in CVD risk factors. Bivariate analyses showed significant environmental correlations shared between the change in weight and the changes in CVD risk factors (p < .05), except for glucose, while there were no significant genetic effects shared between the phenotypes. After adjusting for baseline values of weight, smoking, and alcohol consumption, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), TG, TC, and LDL significantly increased by 1.6 mmHg, 0.09 mmol/L, 0.10 mmol/L, and 0.09 mmol/L, respectively, per 1 kg increase in within-pair differences in weight change. In Korean MZ twins, similarity between twins for changes in weight and CVD risk factors were small to moderate, and non-genetic factors were responsible for the associations between the change in weight and changes in DBP, TG, TC, and LDL.",

    "abstract": "To quantify heredity's effects on the burden of illness in the Medicare population, this study linked information between participants in a research twin registry to a comprehensive set of Medicare claims. To calculate disease categories, the authors used the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Hierarchical Conditions Categories (HCC) model that was developed to risk adjust Medicare's capitation payments to private health care plans based on the health expenditure risk of their enrollees. Using the Medicare database, 2 sets of unrelated but demographically matched control pairs (MCPs) were generated, one specific for the monozygotic twin population and the second specific for the dizygotic twin population. The concordance and correlation rates of the 70 HCC categories for the 2 twin populations, in comparison to their corresponding MCP, was then calculated using Medicare claims data from 1991 through 2011. When indicated, HCCs for which there was a statistically significant difference between the twin and corresponding MCP control group were analyzed by calculating concordance and correlation rates of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes that compose the HCC. Findings reveal that monozygotic twins share 6.5% more HCC disease categories than their MCP while dizygotic twins share 3.8% more HCC disease categories than their MCP. Atrial fibrillation is a highly heritable disease category, a finding consistent with prior literature describing the heritability of the cardiac arrhythmias. These findings are consistent with qualitative assessments of heredity's role found in previous models of population health, and provide both novel methods and quantitative evidence to support future model development.",

    "abstract": "Puberty is characterized by major changes in hormone levels and structural changes in the brain. To what extent these changes are associated and to what extent genes or environmental influences drive such an association is not clear. We acquired circulating levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol and testosterone and magnetic resonance images of the brain from 190 twins at age 9 [9.2 (0.11) years; 99 females/91 males]. This protocol was repeated at age 12 [12.1 (0.26) years] in 125 of these children (59 females/66 males). Using voxel-based morphometry, we tested whether circulating hormone levels are associated with grey matter density in boys and girls in a longitudinal, genetically informative design. In girls, changes in FSH level between the age of 9 and 12 positively associated with changes in grey matter density in areas covering the left hippocampus, left (pre)frontal areas, right cerebellum, and left anterior cingulate and precuneus. This association was mainly driven by environmental factors unique to the individual (i.e. the non-shared environment). In 12-year-old girls, a higher level of circulating estradiol levels was associated with lower grey matter density in frontal and parietal areas. This association was driven by environmental factors shared among the members of a twin pair. These findings show a pattern of physical and brain development going hand in hand.",

    "abstract": "Testosterone is an important hormone in the sexual differentiation of the brain, contributing to differences in cognitive abilities between males and females. For instance, studies in clinical populations such as females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) who are exposed to high levels of androgens in utero support arguments for prenatal testosterone effects on characteristics such as visuospatial cognition and behaviour. The comparison of opposite-sex (OS) and same-sex (SS) twin pairs can be used to help establish the role of prenatal testosterone. However, although some twin studies confirm a masculinizing effect of a male co-twin regarding for instance perception and cognition it remains unclear whether intra-uterine hormone transfer exists in humans. Our aim was to test the potential influences of testosterone on academic performance in OS twins. We compared ninth-grade test scores and teacher ratings of OS (n=1812) and SS (n=4054) twins as well as of twins and singletons (n=13,900) in mathematics, physics/chemistry, Danish, and English. We found that males had significantly higher test scores in mathematics than females (.06-.15 SD), whereas females performed better in Danish (.33-.49 SD), English (.20 SD), and neatness (.45-.64 SD). However, we did not find that OS females performed better in mathematics than SS and singleton females, nor did they perform worse either in Danish or English. Scores for OS and SS males were similar in all topics. In conclusion, this study did not provide evidence for a masculinization of female twins with male co-twins with regard to academic performance in adolescence.",

    "abstract": "to evaluate neonatal morbidity and mortality in monochorionic-diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies complicated by selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) and non-selective intrauterine growth resctriction (nsIUGR).\nneonatal morbidity parameters and mortality were analyzed in 34 twins with IUGR (< 10th percentile on twins' growth charts): 18 with sIUGR and 16 with nsIUGR. The sIUGR group was made up of 18 pregnancies in which growth was restricted in only one fetus (n = 18). The nsIUGR group was composed of 8 pregnancies in which both fetuses presented restricted growth (n = 16). Cases of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome and fetal malformation were not included in the study.\nthe MCDA twin pregnancies with sIUGR had a higher rate of orotracheal intubation (p = 0.001) and mechanical ventilation (p = 0.0006), as well as longer than average fasting time (p = 0.014) compared to those in which the fetuses had nsIUGR. A higher incidence was also observed of types II and III umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry patterns in the sIUGR cases (p = 0.002). There was no significant difference between the two groups as to mortality during pregnancy and the neonatal period (p = 0.09).\nin MCDA twin pregnancies, sIUGR presents more severe umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry abnormalities and worse morbidity than nsIUGR.",

    "abstract": "Environmental and genetic factors contribute to variation in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), anxiety and depression. Comorbidity between these disorders is high. A previous investigation of our population-based twin cohort revealed that low birth weight increased the risk for development of IBS, with environmental influences in utero as the most relevant contributing factor. We hypothesise that both intrauterine and genetic factors influence the co-occurrence of IBS and symptoms of anxiety and depression.\nA postal questionnaire sent to 12700 Norwegian twins born between 1967 and 1979 comprised a checklist of 31 illnesses and symptoms, including IBS and symptoms of anxiety and depression. The influence of genetic factors and intrauterine growth on comorbidity between these disorders were analysed in the full sample and compared to those based on only monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for IBS (95 pairs) in birth weight group < 2500 g and \u2265 2500 g.\nIn the co-twin analyses restricted growth (birth weight < 2500 g) was significantly associated with anxiety and depression (average birth weight difference of 181.0 g (p <0.0001) and 249.9 g (p < 0.0001), respectively). The analysis of the full sample revealed that IBS was significantly associated with symptoms of anxiety (adjusted OR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.9, 3.3) and depression (adjusted OR = 2.3. 95% CI: 1.8, 3.0). Analyses of MZ pairs discordant for IBS indicated significant associations between IBS and symptoms of anxiety (OR = 3.7, 95% CI: 1.3, 10.5) and between IBS and symptoms of depression (OR = 4.2, 95% CI: 1.7, 9.9) only in the birth weight group below 2500 g.\nOur findings suggest that genetic factors partly explain the association between IBS and symptoms of anxiety and depression. In the low range of birth weight (<2500 g), restricted fetal growth seems to be a common contributing factor to the co-occurrence between these disorders.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the degree to which genetic and environmental influences affect variation in adolescent optimism. Optimism (3 items and 6 items approach) and pessimism were assessed by the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R) in 5,187 adolescent twins and 999 of their non-twin siblings from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR). Males reported significantly higher optimism scores than females, while females score higher on pessimism. Genetic structural equation modeling revealed that about one-third of the variance in optimism and pessimism was due to additive genetic effects, with the remaining variance being explained by non-shared environmental effects. A bivariate correlated factor model revealed two dimensions with a genetic correlation of -.57 (CI -.67, -.47), while the non-shared environmental correlation was estimated to be -.21 (CI -.25, -.16). Neither an effect of shared environment, non-additive genetic influences, nor quantitative sex differences was found for both dimensions. This result indicates that individual differences in adolescent optimism are mainly accounted for by non-shared environmental factors. These environmental factors do not contribute to the similarity of family members, but to differences between them. Familial resemblance in optimism and pessimism assessed in adolescents is fully accounted for by genetic overlap between family members.",

    "abstract": "Although several studies have shown that pubertal tempo and timing are shaped by genetic and environmental factors, few studies consider to what extent endocrine triggers of puberty are shaped by genetic and environmental factors. Doing so moves the field from examining correlated developmentally-sensitive biomarkers toward understanding what drives those associations. Two puberty related hormones, dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone, were assayed from salivary samples in 118 MZ (62 % female), 111 same sex DZ (46 % female) and 103 opposite-sex DZ twin pairs, aged 12-16 years (M = 13.1, SD = 1.3). Pubertal status was assessed with a composite of mother- and self-reports. We used biometric models to estimate the genetic and environmental influences on the variance and covariance in testosterone and DHEA, with and without controlling for their association with puberty, and to test for sex differences. In males, the variance in testosterone and pubertal status was due to shared and non-shared environmental factors; variation in DHEA was due to genetic and non-shared environmental factors. In females, variance in testosterone was due to genetic and non-shared environmental factors; genetic, shared, and non-shared environmental factors contributed equally to variation in DHEA. In males, the testosterone-DHEA covariance was primarily due to shared environmental factors that overlapped with puberty as well as shared and non-shared environmental covariation specific to testosterone and DHEA. In females, the testosterone-DHEA covariance was due to genetic factors overlapping with pubertal status, and shared and non-shared environmental covariation specific to testosterone and DHEA.",

    "abstract": "Fragranced product chemical mixtures may be relevant for environmental health, but little is known about exposure. We analyzed results from an olfactory challenge with the synthetic musk fragrance 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethyl-cyclopento-\u03b3-2-benzopyran (HHCB), and a questionnaire about attitudes toward chemical safety and use of fragranced products, in a sample of 140 white and 17 black twin pairs attending a festival in Ohio. Data for each product were analyzed using robust ordered logistic regressions with random intercepts for \"twin pair\" and \"sharing address with twin\", and fixed effects for sex, age, education, and \"ever being bothered by fragrances\". Due to the small number of black participants, models were restricted to white participants except when examining racial differences. Overall patterns of association were summarized across product-types through random-effects meta-analysis. Principal components analysis was used to summarize clustering of product use. The dominant axis of variability in fragranced product use was \"more vs. less\", followed by a distinction between household cleaning products and personal care products. Overall, males used fragranced products less frequently than females (adjusted proportionate odds ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.33, 0.93). This disparity was driven by personal care products (0.42, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.96), rather than household cleaning products (0.79, 95% CI: 0.49, 1.25) and was particularly evident for body lotion (0.12, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.27). Overall usage differed by age (0.64, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.95) but only hand soap and shampoo products differed significantly. \"Ever being bothered by fragrance\" had no overall association (0.92, 95% CI: 0.65, 1.30) but was associated with laundry detergent use (0.46, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.93). Similarly, black vs. white differences on average were not significant (1.34, 95% CI: 0.55, 3.28) but there were apparent differences in use of shampoo (0.01, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.69), body lotion (4.67, 95% CI: 1.18, 18.47), and perfume (6.22, 95% CI:1.08, 35.89). There was no overall association with thinking about product risks (0.90, 95% CI: 0.79, 1.02), nor with inability to smell HHCB (0.84, 95% CI: 0.63, 1.12). Exposure to fragranced products may differ demographically. The relevance for health disparities should be studied.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity is associated with a decreased occurrence of dementia. In twins, we investigated the effect of persistent physical activity in adulthood on mortality due to dementia.\nPhysical activity was queried in 1975 and 1981 from the members of the older Finnish Twin Cohort (n = 21,791), who were aged 24-60 years at the end of 1981. The subjects were divided into three categories according to the persistence of their vigorous physical activity. Dementia deaths were followed up to the end of 2011.\nDuring the 29-year follow-up, 353 subjects died of dementia. In individual-based analyses the age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 0.65 (95% CI 0.43-0.98) for subjects partaking in vigorous physical activities in both 1975 and 1981 compared to those who were inactive in both years. No significant change was observed after adjusting for potential confounding factors. The corresponding HR for within-pair comparisons of the less active twin versus the more active co-twin was 0.48 (95% CI 0.17-1.32). The results for analyses of the volume of physical activity were inconclusive.\nPersistent vigorous leisure-time physical activity protects from dementia, and the effect appears to remain after taking into account childhood environment.",

Pygopagus are one of the rare types of conjoined twins with only a handful of cases reported in the literature. We present the case of one-and-half month-old male pygopagus conjoined twins, who were joined together dorsally in lower lumbar and sacral region and had spina bifida and shared a single thecal sac with combined weight of 6.14 kg. Spinal cord was separated at the level of the conus followed by duraplasty. They had uneventful recovery with normal 15 months follow-up.\nSeparation of conjoined twins is recommended in where this is feasible with the anticipated survival of both or one infant.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to report a successful twin pregnancy and delivery in a female patient with X-linked dominant incontinentia pigmenti (IP) who underwent assisted reproductive technology followed by preimplantation genetic screening (PGS). A 29-year-old female with IP had a previous history of recurrent spontaneous abortion. A molecular analysis revealed the patient had a de novo mutation, 1308_1309insCCCCTTG(p.Ala438ProfsTer26), in the inhibitor of the kappa B kinase gamma gene located in the Xq28 region. IVF/ICSI and PGS was performed, in which male embryos were sexed using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). After IVF/ICSI and PGS using aCGH on seven embryos, two euploid male blastocysts were transferred with a 50% probability of a viable male pregnancy. The dizygotic twin pregnancy was confirmed and the amniocentesis results of each twin were normal with regard to the mutation found in the mother. The patient delivered healthy twin babies during the 37th week of gestation. This case shows the beneficial role of PGS in achieving a successful pregnancy through euploid male embryo gender selection in a woman with X-linked dominant IP with a history of multiple male miscarriages.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare the impact of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (UCMSC) transplantation on the motor functions of identical twins with cerebral palsy (CP) and to analyze the correlation between the efficacy and hereditary factors.\nEight pairs (16 individuals) of identical twins with CP were recruited and received allogenic UCMSC transplantation by means of subarachnoid injection. The gross motor function measure (GMFM) and the fine motor function measure (FMFM) were performed before and 1 and 6 months after the treatment to analyze the results of individuals before and after the therapy, between two individuals of an identical twin and among twin pairs. Repeated-measured data variance was used to analyze the GMFM and FMFM scores of patients before and 1 and 6 months after the therapy.\nEight pairs (16 individuals) of children with CP had significant improvement in the GMFM at the end of the 1st and 6th months after the therapy compared with that before the therapy, whereas the amelioration of the FMFM was not statistically significant. The improvements in motor functions between two individuals of an identical twin but not among twin pairs were correlated.\nUCMSC transplantation significantly improves GMFM in children with CP; motor function improvements in the GMFM between two individuals of an identical twin were closely correlated, but improvements among twin pairs were not correlated. We hypothesize that hereditary factors contribute to the mechanisms of UCMSC transplantation in motor function improvement in children with CP.",

    "abstract": "The genetic influences on aging-related phenotypes, including cognition and depression, have been well confirmed in the Western populations. We performed the first twin-based analysis on cognitive performance, memory and depression status in middle-aged and elderly Chinese twins, representing the world's largest and most rapidly aging population. The sample consisted of 384 twin pairs with a median age of 50 years. Cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale; memory was assessed using the revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence scale; depression symptomatology was evaluated by the self-reported 30-item Geriatric Depression (GDS-30)scale. Both univariate and multivariate twin models were fitted to the three phenotypes with full and nested models and compared to select the best fitting models. Univariate analysis showed moderate-to-high genetic influences with heritability 0.44 for cognition and 0.56 for memory. Multivariate analysis by the reduced Cholesky model estimated significant genetic (rG = 0.69) and unique environmental (rE = 0.25) correlation between cognitive ability and memory. The model also estimated weak but significant inverse genetic correlation for depression with cognition (-0.31) and memory (-0.28). No significant unique environmental correlation was found for depression with other two phenotypes. In conclusion, there can be a common genetic architecture for cognitive ability and memory that weakly correlates with depression symptomatology, but in the opposite direction.",

    "abstract": "Inclusion body myopathy, Paget disease of bone and/or frontotemporal dementia is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the Valosin Containing Protein (VCP) gene. We compared clinical findings including MRI images and neuropsychological assessment data in affected and unaffected twin brothers aged 56\u2009years from a family with the p.R155C VCP gene mutation. The affected twin presented with a 10 year history of progressive proximal muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing, gastroesophageal reflux, fecal incontinence, and peripheral neuropathy. Comprehensive neuropsychological testing revealed rapid cognitive decline in the absence of any behavioral changes in a span of 1 year. This case illustrates that frontotemporal dementia related cognitive impairment may precede behavioral changes in VCP disease as compared with predominance of behavioral impairment reported in previous studies. Our findings suggest that there is a need to establish VCP disease specific tools and normative rates of decline to detect pre-clinical cognitive impairment among affected individuals.",

    "abstract": "Using a twins study, we sought to assess the contribution of genetic against environmental factor as they affect the age at transition from infancy to childhood (ICT).\nThe subjects were 56 pairs of monozygotic twins, 106 pairs of dizygotic twins, and 106 pairs of regular siblings (SBs), for a total of 536 children. Their ICT was determined, and a variance component analysis was implemented to estimate components of the familial variance, with simultaneous adjustment for potential covariates.\nWe found substantial contribution of the common environment shared by all types of SBs that explained 27.7% of the total variance in ICT, whereas the common twin environment explained 9.2% of the variance, gestational age 3.5%, and birth weight 1.8%. In addition, 8.7% was attributable to sex difference, but we found no detectable contribution of genetic factors to inter-individual variation in ICT age.\nDevelopmental plasticity impacts much of human growth. Here we show that of the \u223c50% of the variance provided to adult height by the ICT, 42.2% is attributable to adaptive cues represented by shared twin and SB environment, with no detectable genetic involvement.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a key factor in the pathogenesis of intra-uterine growth restriction in singleton. However, its role in selective intra-uterine growth restriction (sIUGR) in monochorionic twins (MCT) is still unknown. This study explored the characteristics of oxidative stresses in the placenta shares of MCT and analyzed their possible connections with sIUGR.\nThe placental levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 gene (HIF1A)mRNA, malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were evaluated in normal MCT (Group A) and sIUGR MCT (Group B). The results were compared between the placental shares of the larger twins (A1/B1) and smaller twins (A2/B2).\nPlacental HIF1A mRNA level significantly increased in Group B. Particularly, HIF1A mRNA level was elevated in the placenta share of the growth-restricted fetus (B2) than the co-twin (B1) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.036). More discordant HIF1A mRNA level was detected in Group B than Group A with larger inter-twin difference (P\u00a0=\u00a00.021). The levels of MDA and 8-OHdG were significantly higher in B2 than B1 in sIUGR MCT (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Both the inter-twin differences of MDA and 8-OHdG were also significantly larger in Group B (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), indicating that discordant oxidative stress existed in the placental shares of sIUGR pregnancies. Finally, MDA concentration was found inversely correlated with neonatal birth weight, in both sIUGR (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.650, P\u00a0=\u00a00.022) and normal MCT (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.632, P\u00a0=\u00a00.027) pregnancies.\nThe elevation of HIF1A mRNA, and MDA/8-OHdG levels in placenta shares of sIUGR MCT suggests that oxidative stress may be involved in the pathogenesis of sIUGR.",

    "abstract": "Very few cases of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) in twins have been reported. Previous work has suggested that vulnerability to IA formation is heritable. Twin studies provide an opportunity to evaluate the impact of genetics on IA characteristics, including IA location. We therefore sought to examine IA location concordance, multiplicity, and rupture status within affected twin-pairs.\nThe Familial Intracranial Aneurysm study was a multicenter study whose goal was to identify genetic and other risk factors for formation and rupture of IAs. The study required at least three affected family members or an affected sibling pair for inclusion. Subjects with fusiform aneurysms, an IA associated with an AVM, or a family history of conditions known to predispose to IA formation, such as polycystic kidney disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, fibromuscular dysplasia, or moyamoya syndrome were excluded. Twin-pairs were identified by birth date and were classified as monozygotic (MZ) or dizygotic (DZ) through DNA marker genotypes. In addition to zygosity, we evaluated twin-pairs by smoking status, major arterial territory of IAs, and rupture status. Location concordance was defined as the presence of an IA in the same arterial distribution (ICA, MCA, ACA, and vertebrobasilar), irrespective of laterality, in both members of a twin-pair. The Fisher exact test was used for comparisons between MZ and DZ twin-pairs.\nA total of 16 affected twin-pairs were identified. Location concordance was observed in 8 of 11 MZ twin-pairs but in only 1 of 5 DZ twin-pairs (p = 0.08). Three MZ subjects had unknown IA locations and comprised the three instances of MZ discordance. Six of the 11 MZ twin-pairs and none of the 5 DZ twin-pairs had IAs in the ICA distribution (p = 0.03). Multiple IAs were observed in 11 of 22 MZ and 5 of 10 DZ twin-pairs. Thirteen (13) of the 32 subjects had an IA rupture, including 10 of 22 MZ twins.\nWe found that arterial location concordance was greater in MZ than DZ twins, which suggests a genetic influence upon aneurysm location. The 16 twin-pairs in the present study are nearly the total of affected twin-pairs that have been reported in the literature to date. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of genetics in the formation and rupture of IAs.",

    "abstract": "Serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentrations were determined in 12\u2009600 adult Swedish twins, applying a high-throughput reverse-phase protein microarray technique. The prevalence of IgA deficiency (IgAD) was found to be 1:241 in monozygotic (MZ) twins and 1:198 in dizygotic (DZ) twins. Hence, the prevalence in twins is markedly elevated as compared with the normal Swedish adult population (1:600). The twins did not show a difference in the frequency of HLA haplotypes in comparison with almost 40\u2009000 healthy Swedish controls. As expected, the risk-conveying HLA alleles A*01, B*08 and DRB1*01 were overrepresented among the IgAD twins and were also associated with significantly lower mean serum IgA concentrations in the twin cohort. In contrast, significantly higher mean IgA concentrations were found among individuals carrying the protective HLA alleles B*07 and DRB1*15. Exome sequencing data from two MZ twin pairs discordant for the deficiency showed no differences between the siblings. Model fitting analyses derived a heritability of 35% and indicate that genetic influences are modestly important for IgAD. The probandwise concordance rates for IgAD were found to be 31% for MZ and 13% for DZ twins.",

    "abstract": "Nearly completed conjoined or fused symmetrical twins are generally called diplopagus. Sheep conjoined twins have been reported less than cow. An apparently female conjoined twin lambs was examined based on external and internal features. In radiology, two vertebral columns and two pairs of the ribs were seen. Only two heads and two necks were separated (thoraco-omphalopygopagus). There were three forelimbs (tribrachius), one of which grew on dorsal region as a notomelus. Teat buds of the monsters differed in number. Only one lamb had umbilicus, including one umbilical vein, and two umbilical arteries locating besides one urinary bladder. This lamb had also one uterus. Two-separated alimentary tracts were observed in a common abdomen. Common thorax and abdominal cavities were separated by a diaphragm. There were two esophageal hiatuses, and two caval foramina but only one aortic hiatus. Two pairs of lungs and two unequal and connected hearts in a common pericardium were observed. Abnormality of the circulatory system might have caused the death of the twins.",

    "abstract": "To examine short-term and longer-term outcomes for twins born at or near term, comparing prelabor cesarean delivery with birth after a trial of labor.\nThis study was conducted on a retrospective cohort of twin pregnancies delivered at 36 weeks of gestation or greater from 2000 to 2009. Pregnancies with an antenatal death, lethal anomaly, birth weight discordance 25% or more, or birth weight less than 2,000 g or more than 4,000 g were excluded. Outcomes included severe hypoxia, stillbirth and neonatal death, and hospital admissions or death during the first 5 years of life.\nApproximately 45% of 7,099 twin pregnancies were delivered by prelabor cesarean delivery. Compared with delivery after labor, prelabor cesarean delivery was associated with significantly reduced risks of adverse neonatal and child outcomes including severe birth hypoxia (0.08% compared with 0.75%, relative risk 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.26), neonatal death (0.00% compared with 0.15%, relative risk 0.05, 95% CI 0.00-0.82), and death up to 5 years of age (0.16% compared with 0.40%, relative risk 0.41, 95% CI 0.20-0.85). Whereas total mortality for first twins was similar after labor (0.15%) compared with prelabor cesarean delivery (0.16%), total mortality was four times more common in second twins born after labor (0.64%) compared with second twins born after prelabor cesarean delivery (0.16%).\nCompared with prelabor cesarean delivery, twin pregnancies at and beyond 36 weeks of gestation delivered after labor have increased risks for birth outcomes associated with hypoxia, with second twins having significantly increased mortality up to 5 years of age. However, the absolute mortality rate for relatively uncomplicated twin pregnancies delivered at or near term is low and needs to be balanced against maternal morbidity.\nII.",

The authors presents a clinical case of monozygotic twins with association of PSC and nonspecific ulcerative colitis (NUC). The first twin had a severe course of PSC and mild course of NUC; he died due to bacterial complications of cholangitis. The second twin--patient B--had an opposite situation: severe course of NUC, while PSC was suspected only after determination of cholestasis biochemical markers. As soon as cholestasis was revealed, patients B was treated with Ursofalk and Budenofalk (2001). He received Salofalk as a remedy of basic therapy for NUC. Repeated liver biopsy (2005) showed no progression of PSC, but there were present minimal biochemical signs of cholestasis. So, it is necessary to investigate the first degree relatives of patients with PSC. The timely administered treatment in some cases gives the possibility of the control of the disease course.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to describe our initial experience of endoscopic laser coagulation of inter-twin placental vessels in the treatment for severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) at SABBAL \"Dr Shterev Hospiat\".\nEndoscopic laser surgery was carried out in eight cases of TTTS and two cases of sFGR at a median gestational age of 21.4 (range 16.4-23.1) weeks. In the group of TTTS there was one, three and four cases of Quintero stage 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Both cases of sFGR were Gratacos type 2.\nIn the eight cases of TTTS, there was survival of both twins in four cases (one, two and one of Quintero stages 2, 3 and 4, respectively), survival of one twin in one case (Quintero stage 3) and death of both twins in three cases (all Quintero stage 4). In the sFGR group, both twins survived in one case and one survived in one case. The three cases of TTTS with death of both twins were in the first four cases of the series and the death occurred during or within 24 hours of the procedure where in 2 cases there was SROM with cervical length 7 and 12 mm respectively. In the seven cases with survivors, the median gestational age at delivery was 32.3 (range 28.1-37.0) weeks.\nOur results from endoscopic surgery in TTTS and sFGR are encouraging and are likely to improve with increasing experience. There was at least one survivor in two of the first four cases and in all six subsequent cases.",

    "abstract": "Twins are two independent babies delivered during the same pregnancy and are divided as monozygotic or dizygotic based on their origin. Dizygotic twins are similar to two siblings and have different genetic information. In contrary, monozygotic twins have a similar genetic identity and provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the contribution of genetic and environmental factors of the disease. The endocrine and metabolic disorders affect a large number of the population including the twins. Diabetes, obesity, and autoimmune thyroid disease are the most common endocrine disorders in general practice. It is essential to understand the genetic basis of endocrine disorders for therapy, prognostication and risk assessment for future generations. In this article, we review the endocrine disorders in relation to their occurrence in monozygotic twins to highlight the genetic and environmental contribution.",

The presented case of developing turkey twin embryos is the first ever described case for this species. The egg weighed 125 g and had 74.6 mm in length and 53.0 mm in width. The embryos died between the 23rd and 24th day of incubation. Both twin 1 and twin 2 were fully developed with body weights of: 37.7 g and 40.3 g, respectively. The likely causes of death include inappropriate arrangement of embryos and insufficient gas exchange in the last period of incubation. The embryos were arranged along the long axis of the egg, one underneath the other, and were closely adhering to one another. The twins were different in plumage pigmentation. In twin 1, a spontaneous mutation of plumage pigmentation (B) was observed, whereas twin 2 showed appropriate pigmentation (b+) in respect to parents.",

    "abstract": "We report the case of Niemann-Pick disease type C with extensive phenotypic heterogeneity in two monozygotic twins. One of the twins presented with a history of obsessive-compulsive disorder and slowly progressive inferior limb clumsiness, dysphagia and dysarthria. Neurological examination revealed a broad-based ataxic gait, limb dysmetria, downward vertical gaze palsy, brisk lower limb reflexes and ankle clonus, while neuropsychological assessment revealed global cognitive deficits in multiple domains. Complete neurological and neuropsychological evaluation in the asymptomatic monozygotic twin brother only revealed mild neurological impairment. In the hypothesis of Niemann-Pick disease type C, Filipin test, measurement of plasma oxysterols levels and genetic analysis were carried out in both twins. Filipin staining showed massive intracellular accumulation of non-esterified cholesterol, plasma oxysterols levels were elevated and genetic analysis revealed a homozygous c.2662 C\u00a0>\u00a0T (p.P888S) mutation in the NPC1 gene (18q11.2) in both twins. 18F-FDG-PET imaging with single-subject analysis revealed a reduced frontal and temporal glucose metabolism, which correlated with disease progression. This case supports the phenotypic variability of Mendelian inherited disorders in monozygotic twins, likely due to epigenetic differences and post-zygotic mutagenesis.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive immune responses in humans rely on somatic genetic rearrangements of Ig and T-cell receptor loci to generate diverse antigen receptors. It is unclear to what extent an individual's genetic background affects the characteristics of the antibody repertoire used in responding to vaccination or infection. We studied the B-cell repertoires and clonal expansions in response to attenuated varicella-zoster vaccination in four pairs of adult identical twins and found that the global antibody repertoires of twin pair members showed high similarity in antibody heavy chain V, D, and J gene segment use, and in the length and features of the complementarity-determining region 3, a major determinant of antigen binding. These twin similarities were most pronounced in the IgM-expressing B-cell pools, but were seen to a lesser extent in IgG-expressing B cells. In addition, the degree of antibody somatic mutation accumulated in the B-cell repertoire was highly correlated within twin pair members. Twin pair members had greater numbers of shared convergent antibody sequences, including mutated sequences, suggesting similarity among memory B-cell clonal lineages. Despite these similarities in the memory repertoire, the B-cell clones used in acute responses to ZOSTAVAX vaccination were largely unique to each individual. Taken together, these results suggest that the overall B-cell repertoire is significantly shaped by the underlying germ-line genome, but that stochastic or individual-specific effects dominate the selection of clones in response to an acute antigenic stimulus.",

    "abstract": "Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure (PP), and body mass index (BMI) are heritable traits in human metabolic health but their common genetic and environmental backgrounds are not well investigated. The aim of this article was to explore the phenotypic and genetic associations among PP, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and BMI. The studied sample contained 615 twin pairs (17-84 years) collected in the Qingdao municipality. Univariate and multivariate structural equation models were fitted for assessing the genetic and environmental contributions. The AE model combining additive genetic (A) and unique environmental (E) factors produced the best fit for each four phenotypes. Heritability estimated in univariate analysis ranged from 0.42 to 0.74 with the highest for BMI (95% CI 0.70-0.78), and the lowest for PP (95% CI 0.34-0.49). The multivariate model estimated (1) high genetic correlations for DBP with SBP (0.87), PP with SBP (0.75); (2) low-moderate genetic correlations between PP and DBP (0.32), each BP component and BMI (0.24-0.37); (3) moderate unique environmental correlation for PP with SBP (0.68) and SBP with DBP (0.63); (4) there was no significant unique environmental correlation between PP and BMI. Overall, our multivariate analyses revealed common genetic and environmental backgrounds for PP, BP, and BMI in Chinese twins.",

    "abstract": "Plasma homocysteine (Hcy) is a modifiable, independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is affected by both environmental and genetic factors. This study aimed to describe the gender- and age-specific distribution of Hcy concentration for 1117 subjects aged 10-66 years, a subset of a community-based rural Chinese twin cohort. In addition, we examined environmental and genetic contributions to variances in Hcy concentration by gender and age groups. We found that the distribution pattern for Hcy varied by both age and gender. Males had higher Hcy than females across all ages. Elevated Hcy was found in 43% of male adults and 13% of female adults. Moreover, nearly one fifth of children had elevated Hcy. Genetic factors could explain 52%, 36% and 69% of the variation in Hcy concentration among children, male adults and female adults, respectively. The MTHFR C677T variant was significantly associated with Hcy concentrations. Smokers with the TT genotype had the highest Hcy levels. Overall, our results indicate that elevated Hcy is prevalent in the children and adults in this rural Chinese population. The early identification of elevated Hcy will offer a window of opportunity for the primary prevention of CVD and metabolic syndrome.",

Urogenital malformations have previously been described as a part of this syndrome. Our adult male patient exhibits no such malformations but has a documented reduced fertility. This fact points to other factors such as haploinsufficiency of one and/or further genes on 15q24 as being responsible for the infertility. Array analysis could be considered as a first hand analysis in the investigation of cases of infertility and intellectual deficiency in adults in analogy to the existing consensus regarding cases of intellectual deficiency in children.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric erythroderma is a severe cutaneous disorder, which may pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Psoriasis, ichthyoses, atopy, seborrhoeic dermatitis, pityriasis rubra pilaris, infections, metabolic diseases, drugs reaction, may cause erythroderma. The therapy should be tailored on each aetiology, if possible. The biochemical and metabolic imbalance should be corrected, and particular attention should be paid to the psychosocial behavior often related to this disfiguring disease.\nTwo 3 year-old Caucasian twins have been suffering from an unmanageable erythroderma since the age of 8 months. The diagnosis of psoriasis, already remarkably expressed in the father's family in three cases of fraternal twins, could be enforced for several points. Major histocompatibility complex, class I, Cw*06 was detected in both twins; we found no transglutaminase-1, no corneodesmosin, nor any Interleukin-36 receptor antagonist gene mutations. We performed a cutaneous histology, positive immunostaining for Lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor, dermoscopy and reflectance confocal microscopy. The twins had previously received systemic steroids, short cycles of low-dosage ciclosporine, followed by etanercept at the dosage of 0,8 mg/kg, without reliable results. Cyclosporine was then reconsidered at a dosage of 5 mg/kg/day with close blood monitoring. After three months of treatment, consistent clearing and significant improvement of their social and psychological behaviour were achieved. After over one year of continuous therapy with cyclosporine, the twins have still maintained the result obtained.\nPediatric erythroderma may pose a great challenge as a potentially life-threatening condition causing extreme distress in children, parents and pediatricians. In young patients it is mandatory to establish correct clinical and instrumental procedures, possibly supplemented by genetic analyses such as those we required, in order to determine an effective and safe therapy in terms of cost-benefit and put patients and family in the best condition to perform common daily activities.",

    "abstract": "Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease with incomplete penetrance and variable expression caused by germline mutation of serine threonine kinase 11/liver kinase B1; it is characterized by hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract, mucocutaneous melanin pigmentation, and increased predisposition to neoplasms. In Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, bilateral Sertoli cell testicular tumors cause endocrine manifestations including gynecomastia and feminization. This study aimed to assess the role of breast ultrasound in the evaluation of the effectiveness of an innovative surgical approach.\nThis report presents a pair of European 9-year-old identical male twins with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, bilateral prepubertal gynecomastia, and testicular multifocal calcifications. Both twins were treated with anastrozole for 2 years. After finishing treatment, both underwent subcutaneous mastectomy performed by the \"modified\" Webster technique. Breast examination and ultrasound were performed before and after the pharmacological and surgical treatment. A breast ultrasound scan before surgery showed bilateral gynecomastia in both patients. No solid nodular or cystic formations were present on either side. After pharmacological therapy and surgical glandular removal, a breast examination showed a significant reduction in breast volume; 1 year after surgery, a breast ultrasound scan of both patients showed a total absence of glandular parenchyma, with muscle planes well represented.\nBreast examination and ultrasound have proved to be a valid approach in the assessment of the treatment of prepubertal gynecomastia because they allow the efficacy of the pharmacological and surgical treatment to be evaluated in a multidisciplinary approach to one of the most frequent endocrine manifestations of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Transplacental transmission of HSV infection is rare, typically associated with Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2) and often reported in term infants, whereas only a few cases of preterm infants with Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) infection are found in the literature. We report the case of a transplacental HSV-1 infection in preterm twins born at 27\u2009weeks gestation. At 23\u2009weeks gestation the mother had experienced primary gingivostomatitis and \"flu-like\" symptoms, which healed without specific treatment. At birth both infants presented disseminated ulcerated skin lesions at the head, trunk and extremities. Soon after birth, the infants required mechanical ventilation and showed multiple organ involvement. On the basis of the mother's positive HSV-1 serology, treatment was established before the Tzanck test, serological findings and polymerase chain reaction of the skin and blood had confirmed the neonatal infection. In spite of the early diagnosis within hours after birth and immediate treatment, the extensive skin involvement associated with rapidly progressing multiorgan failure resulted in death of both infants within 3 days. Although a primary HSV-1 infection during pregnancy is extremely rare, gingivostomatitis with general symptoms can lead to transplacental infection and should therefore be taken seriously. Prompt recognition and treatment in the mother are paramount and might be life-saving for the infants.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation has a great potential for understanding the aetiology of common complex traits such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we perform genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) in whole-blood-derived DNA from 27 monozygotic twin pairs and follow up results with replication and integrated omics analyses. We identify predominately hypermethylated T2D-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and replicate the top signals in 42 unrelated T2D cases and 221 controls. The strongest signal is in the promoter of the MALT1 gene, involved in insulin and glycaemic pathways, and related to taurocholate levels in blood. Integrating the DNA methylome findings with T2D GWAS meta-analysis results reveals a strong enrichment for DMRs in T2D-susceptibility loci. We also detect signals specific to T2D-discordant twins in the GPR61 and PRKCB genes. These replicated T2D associations reflect both likely causal and consequential pathways of the disease. The analysis indicates how an integrated genomics and epigenomics approach, utilizing an MZ twin design, can provide pathogenic insights as well as potential drug targets and biomarkers for T2D and other complex traits.",

    "abstract": "To find a potential underlying cause for Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome (MRKHS) discordance in monozygotic twins.\nProspective comparative study.\nUniversity hospital.\nOur study genetically analyzed 5 MRKHS-discordant monozygotic twin pairs with the unique opportunity to include saliva and rudimentary uterine tissue.\nBlood, saliva, or rudimentary uterine tissue from five MRKHS-discordant twins was analyzed and compared between twin pairs as well as within the same individual where applicable. We used copy number variations (CNVs) to identify differences.\nCNVs in blood, rudimentary uterine tissue, and saliva, network analysis, and review of the literature.\nOne duplication found in the affected twin included two genes, matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 10 (LRP10), which have known functions in the embryonic development of the uterus and endometrium. The duplicated region was detected in rudimentary uterine tissue from the same individual but not in saliva, making a tissue-specific mosaicism a possible explanation for twin discordance. Additional network analysis revealed important connections to differentially expressed genes from previous studies. These genes encode several molecules involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and neoangiogenesis.\nMMP-14, LRP-10, ECM, and neoangiogenesis genes are identified as candidate genes in a tissue-specific mosaicism. The detected clusters provide evidence of deficient vascularization during uterine development and/or disturbed reorganization of ECM components, potentially during m\u00fcllerian duct elongation signaled by the embryologically relevant phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway.\u00a0Therefore, we consider these genes to be new candidates in the manifestation of MRKHS.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins share nearly all of their genetic variants and many similar environments before and after birth. However, they can also show phenotypic discordance for a wide range of traits. Differences at the epigenetic level may account for such discordances. It is well established that epigenetic states can contribute to phenotypic variation, including disease. Epigenetic states are dynamic and potentially reversible marks involved in gene regulation, which can be influenced by genetics, environment, and stochastic events. Here, we review advances in epigenetic studies of discordant MZ twins, focusing on disease. The study of epigenetics and disease using discordant MZ twins offers the opportunity to control for many potential confounders encountered in general population studies, such as differences in genetic background, early-life environmental exposure, age, gender, and cohort effects. Recently, analysis of disease-discordant MZ twins has been successfully used to study epigenetic mechanisms in aging, cancer, autoimmune disease, psychiatric, neurological, and multiple other traits. Epigenetic aberrations have been found in a range of phenotypes, and challenges have been identified, including sampling time, tissue specificity, validation, and replication. The results have relevance for personalized medicine approaches, including the identification of prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic targets. The findings also help to identify epigenetic markers of environmental risk and molecular mechanisms involved in disease and disease progression, which have implications both for understanding disease and for future medical research.",

    "abstract": "Studies on the human gut microbiota have suggested that human individuals could be categorized into enterotypes based on the compositions of their gut microbial communities. Here, we report that the gut microbiota of healthy Koreans are clustered into two enterotypes, dominated by either Bacteroides (enterotype 1) or Prevotella (enterotype 2). More than 72% of the paired fecal samples from monozygotic twin pairs were assigned to the same enterotype. Our longitudinal analysis of these twins indicated that more than 80% of the individuals belonged to the same enterotype after about a 2-year interval. Microbial functions based on KEGG pathways were also divided into two clusters. For enterotype 2, 100% of the samples belonged to the same functional cluster, while for enterotype 1, approximately half of the samples belonged to each functional cluster. Enterotype 2 was significantly associated with long-term dietary habits that were high in dietary fiber, various vitamins, and minerals. Among anthropometrical and biochemical traits, the level of serum uric acid was associated with enterotype.

    "abstract": "A low birth weight has been extensively related to poor adult health outcomes. Birth weight can be seen as a proxy for environmental conditions during prenatal development. Identical twin pairs discordant for birth weight provide an extraordinary model for investigating the association between birth weight and adult life health while controlling for not only genetics but also postnatal rearing environment. We performed an epigenome-wide profiling on blood samples from 150 pairs of adult monozygotic twins discordant for birth weight to look for molecular evidence of epigenetic signatures in association with birth weight discordance.\nOur association analysis revealed no CpG site with genome-wide statistical significance (FDR < 0.05) for either qualitative (larger or smaller) or quantitative discordance in birth weight. Even with selected samples of extremely birth weight discordant twin pairs, no significant site was found except for 3 CpGs that displayed age-dependent intra-pair differential methylation with FDRs 0.014 (cg26856578, p = 3.42e-08), 0.0256 (cg15122603, p = 1.25e-07) and 0.0258 (cg16636641, p = 2.05e-07). Among the three sites, intra-pair differential methylation increased with age for cg26856578 but decreased with age for cg15122603 and cg16636641. There was no genome-wide statistical significance for sex-dependent effects on intra-pair differential methylation in either the whole samples or the extremely discordant twins.\nGenome-wide DNA methylation profiling did not reveal epigenetic signatures of birth weight discordance although some sites displayed age-dependent intra-pair differential methylation in the extremely discordant twin pairs.",

    "abstract": "The objective is to evaluate whether a breach presentation of the second twin has an influence on the perinatal results in vaginal births of bichorial-biamniotic twins after 33rd week of pregnancy.\nRetrospective analysis.\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno.\nThe current study is a retrospective analysis of 695 vaginal births of bichorial-biamniotic twins after 33rd week of pregnancy. All births were conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno during the span of 2004-2013. The sample was divided into2 groups. Group A consisted of 550 births of both twins in vertex presentation, group B consisted of 145 births in which the second twin happened to be in the breach presentation. The factors that have been evaluated include the percentage of births finished vaginally, perinatal results (pH a. umbilicalis below 7.0 and Apgar score in the 5th minute below 5) and early neonatal mortality and morbidity. Data from both groups have been compared with the use of Fishers exact test.\nFor the group A, 81.3% of births were finished vaginally, as opposed to 85.5% in group B. Acute Caesarean sections conducted on the second twin consisted 4% (22 cases) in group A and 3.4% (5 cases) in group B. No significant difference has been found between the two groups in both perinatal results (p = 0.6 for pH from a. umbilicalis below 7.0 and p = 0.7 for Apgar score in the 5th minute below 5; both two-tailed) and in the frequency of early neonatal mortality and morbidity. In total,5 neonatal deaths have occured in 28 days after birth, out of which 2 have occured in group A and 3 in group B.\nIt was concluded that breach presentation of the second twin does not influence perinatal results in vaginal births of bichorial-biamniotic twins.\nbichorial-biamniotic twins, vaginal birth, breach presentation, perinatal mortality, perinatal morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Cytokines and vitamin D both have a role in modulating the immune system, and are also potentially useful biomarkers in mental illnesses such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia. Studying the variability of cytokines and vitamin D in a healthy population sample may add to understanding the association between these biomarkers and mental illness. To assess genetic and environmental contributions to variation in circulating levels of cytokines and vitamin D (25-hydroxy vitamin D: 25(OH)D3), we analyzed data from a healthy adolescent twin cohort (mean age 16.2 years; standard deviation 0.25). Plasma cytokine measures were available for 400 individuals (85 MZ, 115 DZ pairs), dried blood spot sample vitamin D measures were available for 378 individuals (70 MZ, 118 DZ pairs). Heritability estimates were moderate but significant for the cytokines transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), 0.57 (95% CI 0.26-0.80) and tumor necrosis factor-receptor type 1 (TNFR1), 0.50 (95% CI 0.11-0.63) respectively. Measures of 25(OH)D3 were within normal range and heritability was estimated to be high (0.86, 95% CI 0.61-0.94). Assays of other cytokines did not generate meaningful results. These potential biomarkers may be useful in mental illness, with further research warranted in larger sample sizes. They may be particularly important in adolescents with mental illness where diagnostic uncertainty poses a significant clinical challenge.",

    "abstract": "Adult health outcomes and health behaviors are often associated with schooling. However, such associations do not necessarily imply that schooling has causal effects on health with the signs or magnitudes found in the cross-sectional associations. Schooling may be proxying for unobserved factors related to genetics and family background that directly affect both health and schooling. Recently several studies have used within-monozygotic (MZ) twins methods to control for unobserved factors shared by identical twins. Within-MZ estimates for developed countries are generally smaller than suggested by cross-sectional associations, consistent with positive correlations between unobserved factors that determine schooling and those that determine health. This study contributes new estimates of cross-sectional associations and within-MZ causal effects using the Chinese Adults Twins Survey, the first study of its type for developing countries. The cross-sectional estimates suggest that schooling is significantly associated with adult health-related behaviors (smoking, drinking, exercising) but not with own or spouse health outcomes (general health, mental health, overweight, chronic diseases). However, within-MZ-twins estimators change the estimates for approximately half of these health indicators, in one case declining in absolute magnitudes and becoming insignificant and in the other cases increasing in absolute magnitudes. Within-MZ estimates indicate significant pro-health effects for at least one of the indicators for own health (better mental health), own health-related behaviors (less smoking) and spouse health (less overweight).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) has been attributed to a combination of genetic and nongenetic factors. We studied a set of monozygotic twins harboring the heterozygous glucocerebrosidase mutation (GBA N370S) but clinically discordant for PD. We applied induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology for PD disease modeling using the twins' fibroblasts to evaluate and dissect the genetic and nongenetic contributions. Utilizing fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we obtained a homogenous population of \"footprint-free\" iPSC-derived midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. The mDA neurons from both twins had \u223c50% GBA enzymatic activity, \u223c3-fold elevated \u03b1-synuclein protein levels, and a reduced capacity to synthesize and release dopamine. Interestingly, the affected twin's neurons showed an even lower dopamine level, increased monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) expression, and impaired intrinsic network activity. Overexpression of wild-type GBA and treatment with MAO-B inhibitors normalized \u03b1-synuclein and dopamine levels, suggesting a combination therapy for the affected twin.",

    "abstract": "To compare monozygotic twinning (MZT) rates in patients undergoing blastocyst or cleavage-stage ET.\nRetrospective cohort.\nAcademic research center.\nAutologous, fresh IVF cycles resulting in a clinical pregnancy from 1999 to 2014.\nNone.\nMonozygotic twin pregnancy in blastocyst-stage transfer vs. cleavage-stage transfer when controlling for patient prognosis and embryo cohort quality factors.\nThere were a total of 9,969 fresh transfer cycles resulting in a pregnancy during the study period. Of these pregnancies, 234 monozygotic twin pregnancies were identified (2.4%). Of all transfers, 5,191 were cleavage-stage and 4,778 were blastocyst-stage transfers. There were a total of 99 MZT identified in the cleavage-stage group (1.9%) and 135 MZT in the blastocyst ET group (2.4%), which was significant. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that increasing age was associated with a significant reduction in MZT, regardless of transfer order. Embryo cohort quality factors, including the number and proportion of six- to eight-cell embryos and availability of supernumerary embryos, were also significant. When controlling for patient age, time period during which the cycle took place, the number and proportion of six- to eight-cell embryos, and availability of supernumerary embryos, there was no longer a difference in MZT rate between blastocyst and cleavage transfer.\nPatient prognosis and embryo cohort quality seem to be major factors in MZT rate in women undergoing blastocyst transfer. Although technology-based effects cannot be excluded, patient and embryo characteristics play an important role.",

    "abstract": "Palmar and finger dermatoglyphics are formed between the 10th and the 17th weeks of gestation and their morphology can be influenced by genetic or environmental factors, interfering with normal intrauterine development. As both the skin and the brain develop from the same embryonal ectoderm, dermatoglyphic alterations may be informative for early abnormal neurodevelopmental processes in the brain. We investigated whether dermatoglyphic alterations are related to structural brain abnormalities in bipolar disorder and to what extent they are of a genetic and of an environmental origin. Dermatoglyphics and volumetric data from structural MRI were obtained in 53 twin pairs concordant or discordant for bipolar disorder and 51 healthy matched control twin pairs. Structural equation modeling was used. Bipolar disorder was significantly positively associated with palmar a-b ridge count (ABRC), indicating higher ABRC in bipolar patients (rph=.17 (CI .04-.30)). Common genes appear to be involved because the genetic correlation with ABRC was significant (rph-A=.21 (CI .05-.36). Irrespective of disease, ABRC showed a genetically mediated association with brain volume, indicated by a significant genetic correlation rph-A of respectively -.36 (CI -.52 to -.22) for total brain, -.34 (CI -.51 to -.16) total cortical volume, -.27 (CI -.43 to -.08) cortical gray matter and -.23 (CI -.41 to -.04) cortical white matter. In conclusion, a genetically determined abnormal development of the foetal ectoderm between the 10th and 15th week of gestation appears related to smaller brain volumes in (subjects at risk for) bipolar disorder.",

    "abstract": "The understanding of the role of genetic factors in phenotypic variation in the emergence of secondary teeth in humans remains is incomplete. Dental emergence data based on a mixed longitudinal study were collected on 111 twin pairs from an urban population of Chandigarh. The observations over time on a single individual varied from one to nine, thus giving a total of 595 entities. Female twins manifested emergence priority over males. The differences between zygosities in mean emergence ages were significant for only 6 of 16 (37%) instances. Magnitude of variations seen between twins and singletons in their mean emergence timings and duration of the hiatus between two dental phases of emergence were of the order observed among different samples from the same population/ethnic group. Heritability estimates for the specified number of the teeth emerged showed age variations. These estimates were highest in the first two age groups (from 5 to 7 years), when the first molars and incisors emerged. Maxilla-mandible differences were seen for tooth emergence timings and sequence patterns. Heritability for tooth emergence timings was higher in maxilla than in mandible. Multifactorial model of inheritance was the best fit model to explain variations observed in dental emergence timings and dental sequence pattern polymorphisms and there were significant genetic components of variation for both of these. There were sex differences in heritability; females had higher estimates than males. Genetic factors accounted for about 60% of the total phenotypic variation in the length of hiatus interval between two active stages of permanent teeth emergence.",

    "abstract": "Multifetal pregnancy reduction (MPR) of triplets to twins results in improved pregnancy outcomes compared with triplet gestations managed expectantly. Perinatal outcomes of early transvaginal MPR from triplets to twins were compared with reduction from triplets to singletons. Seventy-four trichorionic triplet pregnancies that underwent early transvaginal MPR at 6-8 weeks gestation were included. Cases were divided into two groups according to the initial procedure: reduction to twin (n = 55) or to singleton (n = 19) gestations. Infants from triplet pregnancies reduced to twins were delivered earlier (36.6 versus 37.9 weeks; P = 0.04) and had lower mean birth weights (2364\u2009g versus 2748\u2009g; P = 0.02) compared with those from triplets reduced to singleton gestations. The rates of pregnancy loss before 24 weeks (3.6% versus 5.3%), as well as of preterm delivery before 32 and 34 weeks of gestation (0% versus 5.3% and 7.3% versus 5.3%, respectively) were similar between the twin and singleton pregnancies. No significant difference was found in the prevalence of gestational diabetes (15.1% versus 5.6%) or gestational hypertension (24.5% versus 16.7%) between the groups. Selective reduction of triplet pregnancies to singleton rather than twin gestations is associated with improved outcomes.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation patterns are characterized by highly conserved developmental programs, but allow for divergent gene expression resulting from stochastic epigenetic drift or divergent environments. Genome-wide methylation studies in monozygotic (MZ) twins are providing insight into the extent of epigenetic variation that occurs, irrespective of genotype. However, little is known about the variability of DNA methylation patterns in adolescence, a period involving significant and rapid physical, emotional, social, and neurodevelopmental change. Here, we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation using the 450\u2009K Illumina BeadChip in a sample of 37 MZ twin pairs followed longitudinally since birth to investigate: 1) the extent of variation in DNA methylation in identical genetic backgrounds in adolescence and; 2) whether these variations are randomly distributed or enriched in particular functional pathways. We also assessed stability of DNA methylation over 3-6 months to distinguish stable trait-like and variable state-like genes. A pathway analysis found high within-pair variability in genes associated with development, cellular mechanisms, tissue and cell morphology, and various disorders. Test-retest analyses performed in a sub-sample of 8 twin pairs demonstrated enrichment in gene pathways involved in organismal development, cellular growth and proliferation, cell signaling, and particular disorders. The variability found in functional gene pathways may plausibly underlie phenotypic differences in this adolescent MZ twin sample. Furthermore, we assessed stability of methylation over 3-6 months and found that some genes were stable while others were unstable, suggesting that the methylome remains dynamic in adolescence and that dynamic sites tend to be organized in certain gene pathways.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic architecture of gene expression is an intermediate step in understanding the genetic architecture of complex diseases. RNA sequencing technologies have improved the quantification of gene expression and allow measurement of allele-specific expression (ASE). ASE is hypothesized to result from the direct effect of cis regulatory variants, but a proper estimation of the causes of ASE has not been performed thus far. In this study, we take advantage of a sample of twins to measure the relative contributions of genetic and environmental effects to ASE, and we find substantial effects from gene \u00d7 gene (G\u00d7G) and gene \u00d7 environment (G\u00d7E) interactions. We propose a model where ASE requires genetic variability in cis, a difference in the sequence of both alleles, but where the magnitude of the ASE effect depends on trans genetic and environmental factors that interact with the cis genetic variants.",

    "abstract": "Unicameral bone cysts (UBCs) are benign tumor-like lesions that commonly occur in the diaphyseal or metaphyseal region of the long bones within the first 2 decades of life. Until today, the pathogenesis of UBC has been unclear, but mechanisms such as vascular occlusion or a response to trauma have been supposed. During the past decade, in particular, the genetic aspects of the development of this rare lesion have been discussed. We present the first case of mirror image monozygotic twins with a mirror image UBC of the calcaneus. Our findings reinforce the importance of additional studies to understand the significance of cytogenetic factors in the etiology of UBC.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophilia in adults refers to an alteration in the total number of blood neutrophils that is in excess of about 7500 cells/\u03bcL. This definition is restrictive in childhood as neutrophil count is age-dependent. Chronic Idiopathic Neutrophilia (CIN) refers to a condition that persists for many years in individuals who appear otherwise healthy. CIN is rarely mentioned in scientific literature and in academic books of hematology; only few words are dedicated to this topic. We report a case study of two twins with CIN followed from the first year of life to 24 years of age. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case report of two twins with CIN followed through a long period of time. We believe that our observation may contribute to better understand and characterize this hematologic abnormality.",

Twinning is a well-known risk factor for congenital defects including external ear deformities. Monozygotic twins usually show identical appearances as well as congenital malformations. In special conditions as ear deformities, \"mirror-image\" may also occur. We report 2 cases of monozygotic twins with different ear deformities. The 8-year-old propositus with lobule type microtia and her identical female twin presented with facial symmetry. Patient A had sausage-type right microtia with absence of external auditory canal. The left external ear showed normal appearance. Patient B presented with left-sided preauricular skin tag and right-sided malformation of tragus with skin tag combined with hyperplasia of underlying cartilage. A granule-size skin tag was also noticed at crus of right helix. A 7-year-old male patient with right-sided conchal type microtia presented to an ear reconstruction center. The patient's mother showed normal auricular appearance. Her monozygotic twin sister, whose son and daughter had normal ear appearance, was diagnosed with a leftsided lobule type microtia.",

    "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurodevelopmental disorder that predominantly affects females, is primarily caused by variants in MECP2. Variants in other genes such as CDKL5 and FOXG1 are usually associated with individuals who manifest distinct phenotypes that may overlap with RTT. Individuals with phenotypes suggestive of RTT are typically screened for variants in MECP2 and then subsequently the other genes dependent on the specific phenotype. Even with this screening strategy, there are individuals in whom no causative variant can be identified, suggesting that there are other novel genes that contribute to the RTT phenotype. Here we report a de novo deletion of protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 4 (PTPN4) in identical twins with a RTT-like phenotype. We also demonstrate the reduced expression of Ptpn4 in a Mecp2 null mouse model of RTT, as well as the activation of the PTPN4 promoter by MeCP2. Our findings suggest that PTPN4 should be considered for addition to the growing list of genes that warrant screening in individuals with a RTT-like phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) account for 1-2% of all tumors in young and middle aged men. A 75-fold increase in TCGT development has been reported for monozygotic (MZ) twins. Therefore, the occurrence of simultaneous tumors in MZ twins emphasizes the importance of genetic factors that influence the risk of developing these tumors. Genomic screening was performed for one family containing MZ twins with testicular germ cell tumors, in order to define alterations associated with risk of tumor development.\nCopy number alterations were evaluated using array-CGH (4x44K, Agilent Technologies) in one seminoma and one embryonal carcinoma (EC) from MZ twins. In addition, genomic alterations from the tumors and peripheral blood cells of the twins were compared to the parental genomes via their peripheral blood cells.\nEmbryonal carcinoma (Twin-1\u00a0t) presented a lower frequency of genomic alterations compared to the seminoma (Twin-2\u00a0t). One minimal common region of loss was observed in 9p13.1-p12 in the comparison between DNA from blood samples for Twin-1 and Twin-2. In this region is mapped the CNTNAP3 gene which was confirmed as involved in losses by qPCR. Comparative analysis of novel CNVs between the Twin-1\u00a0t and Twin-2\u00a0t showed five minimal common regions involving gain at chromosomes 12 (12p12.3-p11.1 and 12p13.33-p12.3), while losses were observed at 10p15.3-p15.2, 13q21.1-q21.2 and 15q11.1-q11.2. In addition, one exclusive rare copy number alteration was detected in Twin-1\u00a0t and Twin-2\u00a0t, and 19 novel alterations were identified in the Twin-2\u00a0t.\nDistinct genomic profiles for MZ twins with phenotypically different TGCT were described. Of particular interest, 12p gains were detected exclusively in tumor samples. In peripheral blood samples, loss of 9p13.1-p12 was the unique novel CNV shared by the twins, confirming the involvement of CNTNAP3 gene in TGCTs development. Although similar CNV profiles were shared by both the peripheral blood and tumor samples of the twins, tumor-specific CNV loci were identified for seminoma and non-seminomatous tumors. These findings suggest the presence of de novo germline structural alterations and TGCT predisposition.",

    "abstract": "Both alcohol-specific genetic factors and genetic factors related to externalizing behavior influence problematic alcohol use. Little is known, however, about the etiologic role of these 2 components of genetic risk on alcohol-related behaviors across development. Prior studies conducted in a male cohort of twins suggest that externalizing genetic factors are important for predicting heavy alcohol use in adolescence, whereas alcohol-specific genetic factors increase in importance during the transition to adulthood. In this report, we studied twin brothers and sisters and brother-sister twin pairs to examine such developmental trajectories and investigate whether sex and cotwin sex effects modify these genetic influences.\nWe used prospective, longitudinal twin data collected between ages 12 and 22 within the population-based FinnTwin12 cohort study (analytic n\u00a0=\u00a01,864). Our dependent measures of alcohol use behaviors included alcohol initiation (age 12), intoxication frequency (ages 14 and 17), and alcohol dependence criteria (age 22). Each individual's genetic risk of alcohol use disorders (AUD-GR) was indexed by his/her parents' and cotwin's DSM-IV Alcohol Dependence (AD) criterion counts. Likewise, each individual's genetic risk of externalizing disorders (EXT-GR) was indexed with a composite measure of parents' and cotwin's DSM-IV Conduct Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder criterion counts.\nEXT-GR was most strongly related to alcohol use behaviors during adolescence, while AUD-GR was most strongly related to alcohol problems in young adulthood. Further, sex of the twin and sex of the cotwin significantly moderated the associations between genetic risk and alcohol use behaviors across development: AUD-GR influenced early adolescent alcohol use behaviors in females more than in males, and EXT-GR influenced age 22 AD more in males than in females. In addition, the associations of AUD-GR and EXT-GR with intoxication frequency were greater among 14- and 17-year-old females with twin brothers.\nWe found divergent developmental trajectories for alcohol-specific and externalizing behavior-related genetic influences on alcohol use behaviors; in early adolescence, genetic influences on alcohol use behaviors are largely nonspecific, and later in adolescence and young adulthood, alcohol-specific genetic influences on alcohol use are more influential. Importantly, within these overall trajectories, several interesting sex differences emerged. We found that the relationship between genetic risk and problematic drinking across development is moderated by the individual's sex and his/her cotwin's sex. AUD-GR influenced adolescent alcohol outcomes in females more than in males and by age 22, EXT-GR influenced AD criteria more for males than females. In addition, the association between genetic risk and intoxication frequency was greater among 14- and 17-year-old females with male cotwins.",

    "abstract": "The behavioural symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are thought to reflect underlying cognitive deficits/differences. The findings in the literature are somewhat mixed regarding the cognitive features of ASD. This study attempted to address this issue by investigating a range of cognitive deficits and the prevalence of multiple cognitive atypicalities in a large population-based sample comprising children with ASD, their unaffected co-twins, and typically developing comparison children.\nParticipants included families from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) where one or both children met diagnostic criteria for ASD. Overall, 181 adolescents with a diagnosis of ASD and 73 unaffected co-twins were included, plus an additional 160 comparison control participants. An extensive cognitive battery was administered to measure IQ, central coherence, executive function, and theory of mind ability.\nDifferences between groups (ASD, co-twin, control) are reported on tasks assessing theory of mind, executive function, and central coherence. The ASD group performed atypically in significantly more cognitive tasks than the unaffected co-twin and control groups. Nearly a third of the ASD group presented with multiple cognitive atypicalities.\nMultiple cognitive atypicalities appear to be a characteristic, but not universal feature, of ASD. Further work is needed to investigate whether specific cognitive atypicalities, either alone or together, are related to specific behaviours characteristic of ASD.",

    "abstract": "To develop reference values for hematological parameters in twins and higher order multiple births immediately after birth and compare them with values from singletons.\nIn this retrospective matched cohort study, hematological parameters immediately after birth from multiples, and gestation- and sex-matched singletons born between 2007 and 2009 were obtained. Infants born with maternal or fetal conditions known to affect hematological values were excluded. Data were compared using Student t-test, chi-square test, and nonparametric tests as appropriate.\nThree hundred sixty-three multiples were matched with 363 singletons. Multiples had lower birth weights and higher rate of conception by in-vitro fertilization than singletons. Mean (SD) hemoglobin (171\u2009\u00b1\u200924 vs. 167\u2009\u00b1\u200923 g/L; p\u2009=\u20090.04) was marginally higher but nucleated red cells were 30% lower (1.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6 vs. 2.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9 10(9)/L, p\u2009<\u20090.01) in multiples. Total white blood cells (WBCs) were 14% lower, absolute neutrophils 30% lower, monocytes 31% lower, basophils 28% lower, and immature WBC 56% lower in multiples.\nMean hemoglobin was higher, whereas total WBC, absolute neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils were significantly lower in multiples compared with singletons. These differences in WBC and neutrophil counts should be considered when interpreting hematological parameters in multiples.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with type 2 diabetes and risk of developing the disease in skeletal muscle biopsies from phenotypically well-characterised twins.\nWe measured muscle miRNA levels in monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for type 2 diabetes using arrays. Further investigations of selected miRNAs included target prediction, pathway analysis, silencing in cells and association analyses in a separate cohort of 164 non-diabetic MZ and dizygotic twins. The effects of elevated glucose and insulin levels on miRNA expression were examined, and the effect of low birthweight (LBW) was studied in rats.\nWe identified 20 miRNAs that were downregulated in MZ twins with diabetes compared with their non-diabetic co-twins. Differences for members of the miR-15 family (miR-15b and miR-16) were the most statistically significant, and these miRNAs were predicted to influence insulin signalling. Indeed, miR-15b and miR-16 levels were associated with levels of key insulin signalling proteins, miR-15b was associated with the insulin receptor in non-diabetic twins and knockdown of miR-15b/miR-16 in myocytes changed the levels of insulin signalling proteins. LBW in twins and undernutrition during pregnancy in rats were, in contrast to overt type 2 diabetes, associated with increased expression of miR-15b and/or miR-16. Elevated glucose and insulin suppressed miR-16 expression in vitro.\nType 2 diabetes is associated with non-genetic downregulation of several miRNAs in skeletal muscle including miR-15b and miR-16, potentially targeting insulin signalling. The paradoxical findings in twins with overt diabetes and twins at increased risk of the disease underscore the complexity of the regulation of muscle insulin signalling in glucose homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "To determine the differences in risk factors for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in paired twins.\nA retrospective medical record review was performed for all paired twins screened for ROP between 2007 and 2012. Screening was offered to very low birth weight (\u2264 1500 grams) and preterm (\u2264 32 weeks) neonates. Twins 1 and 2 were categorized based on the order of delivery. Maternal and neonatal covariates were analyzed using univariate and multivariate regression analyses for both ROP and Type 1 ROP.\nIn 34 pairs of Chinese twins, the mean gestational age (GA) was 30.2 \u00b1 2.0 weeks. In Twin 1, smaller GA (OR = 0.44, P = 0.02), higher mean oxygen concentration (OR = 1.34, P = 0.03), presence of thrombocytopenia (OR = 1429.60, P < 0.0001), and intraventricular hemorrhage (OR = 18.67, P = 0.03) were significant risk factors for ROP. For Twin 2, a smaller GA (OR = 0.45, P = 0.03) was the only risk factor. There were no significant risk factors for ROP in Twin 1 or Twin 2 on multivariate analysis.\nIn Chinese twin pairs, smaller GA was the only common risk factor for ROP while Twin 1 was more susceptible to the postnatal risks for ROP.",

    "abstract": "Lipomyelomeningocele, a congenital spine defect, is presented as skin-covered lipomatous tissue that attaches to the cord in different ways according to its subtypes. Unlike other types of neural tube defects, the exact cause of this birth defect has not been confirmed yet, but it is proposed to be a multifactorial disease with involvement of both genetic and environmental factors. The authors describe identical twins with lipomyelomeningocele of the same subtype and location without any familial history of similar abnormality. Therefore, the same genetic and/or environmental risk factors could have played a part in their condition.",

    "abstract": "Posture and plantar pressure distribution can influence several factors, including both foot type and heritability. Therefore, the purpose was to assess the influence of foot type and heritability and their effects on foot characteristics. Static and dynamic balance and plantar pressure distribution was assessed, and the participants were pairs of female twins.\nSixteen monozygotic and fourteen dizygotic pairs with no history of injuries were included in this causal-comparative study, divided into three foot types by navicular drop test: pes planus, pes rectus and pes cavus. Static balance was measured using the stork test and dynamic balance using the SEBT test. Plantar pressure distributions were measured by the emed platform. Two-way ANOVA, F test, heritability estimate, intraclass correlation coefficient and Fisher Z test were used for statistical analysis.\nNo significant differences were found between foot types or zygosities in static and dynamic balance and peak pressure (P>0.05). Within-pair variances were significantly different in dynamic balance in PL and L directions (P<0.05). Heritability was 0.43, 0.52, 0.62, 0.65 and 0.39 in static balance and dynamic balance variables in P, PL, L and mean of eight directions, respectively. Genetic factors revealed no influence on peak pressure. Within-pair correlations were significantly different in dynamic balance results in PL and L directions (P<0.05).\nFoot type and zygosities had no influence on balance or peak pressure. Genetic factors moderately influenced postural balance, but not peak pressure. The current study is an asset to identify and manage influential factors in these variables for female twins.",

    "abstract": "Studies on twins with concordant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have revealed that ETV6-RUNX1 gene fusion is a common, prenatal genetic event with other driver aberrations occurring subclonally and probably postnatally. The fetal cell type that is transformed by ETV6-RUNX1 is not identified by such studies or by the analysis of early B-cell lineage phenotype of derived progeny. Ongoing, clonal immunoglobulin (IG) and cross-lineage T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements are features of B-cell precursor leukemia and commence at the pro-B-cell stage of normal B-cell lineage development. We reasoned that shared clonal rearrangements of IG or TCR genes by concordant ALL in twins would be informative about the fetal cell type in which clonal advantage is elicited by ETV6-RUNX1. Five pairs of twins were analyzed for all varieties of IG and TCR gene rearrangements. All pairs showed identical incomplete or complete variable-diversity-joining junctions coupled with substantial, subclonal and divergent rearrangements. This pattern was endorsed by single-cell genetic scrutiny in one twin pair. Our data suggest that the pre-leukemic initiating function of ETV6-RUNX1 fusion is associated with clonal expansion early in the fetal B-cell lineage.",

    "abstract": "Negative cognitive bias and aberrant neural processing of emotional faces are trait-marks of depression. Yet it is unclear whether these changes constitute an endophenotype for depression and are also present in healthy individuals with hereditary risk for depression.\nThirty healthy, never-depressed monozygotic (MZ) twins with a co-twin history of depression (high risk group: n\u00a0=\u00a013) or without co-twin history of depression (low-risk group: n\u00a0=\u00a017) were enrolled in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. During fMRI, participants viewed fearful and happy faces while performing a gender discrimination task. After the scan, they were given a faces dot-probe task, a facial expression recognition task and questionnaires assessing mood, personality traits and coping strategies.\nHigh-risk twins showed increased neural response to happy and fearful faces in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), pre-supplementary motor area and occipito-parietal regions compared to low-risk twins. They also displayed stronger negative coupling between amygdala and pregenual ACC, dmPFC and temporo-parietal regions during emotional face processing. These task-related changes in neural responses in high-risk twins were accompanied by impaired gender discrimination performance during face processing. They also displayed increased attention vigilance for fearful faces and were slower at recognizing facial expressions relative to low-risk controls. These effects occurred in the absence of differences between groups in mood, subjective state or coping.\nDifferent neural response and functional connectivity within fronto-limbic and occipito-parietal regions during emotional face processing and enhanced fear vigilance may be key endophenotypes for depression.",

    "abstract": "Despite the notion that monozygotic (identical) twins share 100% identical genetic information, genetic differences among monozygotic twin pairs do occur and can be explained by mechanisms occurring during post-zygotic events. Despite such twins being fundamentally \"identical\", these post-zygotic genetic changes may give rise to phenotypic differences and genetic diseases. Consequently, studies of monozygotic twin pairs discordant for specific genetic diseases represent an important tool for the identification of disease genes. We used array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and methylation arrays to search for genetic and epigenetic differences in blood drawn from four monozygotic twin pairs discordant for testicular germ cell tumors. No consistent differences were identified. A larger twin study would be required to achieve confident discovery of very subtle differences between monozygotic twins discordant for testicular germ cell tumors.",

    "abstract": "While previous studies have shown a link between cigarette smoking and disordered eating (DE), it is less clear whether this association can be explained by attempts to control weight and/or temperament. This study had two aims: to examine weight/shape and DE symptomatology associated with weight control-related smoking and disordered eating; second, to investigate whether temperament-based factors explain the association between compensatory smoking and weight and shape-related characteristics, and disordered eating symptoms.\nFemale twins (N = 1,002) from the Australian Twin Registry, aged 28-39 years, were assessed by interview yielding lifetime diagnostic information of disordered eating and use of cigarette smoking for weight control. Self-report measures of temperament were available.\nWomen who had never smoked (50.6%, n = 495) or had smoked for reasons other than weight and shape control (42.5%, n = 415) were generally not differentiated with respect to indicators of disordered eating. Women who smoked for reasons primarily associated with weight and shape control (6.9%, n = 67) had significantly higher levels of disordered eating than non-smokers identified as being higher levels of purging (OR = 4.55, 95% CI = 2.41-8.59) and fasting (OR = 9.32, 94% CI = 4.43-19.90) but not objective binge episodes (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 0.71-3.99). Of those women diagnosed with lifetime eating disorders, weight-control smokers had higher levels of purging (OR = 4.22, 95% CI = 1.13-15.80) than those who did not. There were no differences in temperament.\nResults support co-occurrence of smoking for weight control and purging in both community and clinical groups, and indicate this association is related to weight control and not temperament.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the potential contributions of environmental factors to variations in facial symmetry between identical twins.\nIdentical male and female twins were recruited from the Twins Days Festival in 2009 and 2010. Subjects independently completed a comprehensive questionnaire on their medical and personal history, and then posed for digital facial photography from several different angles. Eight facial features from these photographs were measured using Adobe Photoshop, and these facial features were then analyzed against survey responses between twins through multivariate regressions.\nA total of 147 pairs of identical twins were included. Twins who slept primarily prone had greater nasal midline deviation (p = 0.047) and oral commissure asymmetry (p = 0.027). Tooth extractions were significantly associated with canting of the plane of occlusion (p = 0.043), and use of dentures was associated with nasal midline deviation (p = 0.032) and oral commissure asymmetry (p = 0.007). Smoking was associated with canting of the plane of occlusion (p = 0.049) and upper eyelid ptosis (p = 0.023). Lastly, headaches were also associated with nasal midline deviation (p = 0.024).\nExogenous factors such as prone sleep position, tooth extractions, dentures, and smoking are significant risk factors for facial asymmetry.\nRisk, II.",

Study subjects were 1016 twins aged 22-75 from the Italian twin registry. We assessed POS by the recently developed P-scale. First, we used confirmatory factor analysis to investigate scale's measurement invariance by age and gender. Then, we applied biometric modelling to estimate genetic and environmental components of POS score. Overall, we found a satisfactory degree of measurement invariance by both age and gender. Results from these analyses further indicated an increasing mean level of POS across the lifespan. Additive genetic and unshared environmental factors explained respectively 58% and 42% of variance in POS score, with no significant gender differences; furthermore, the pattern of change of gene-environment architecture of POS over time was consistent with a greater plasticity of personality at older ages.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, we investigated genetic and environmental effects on motor impulsivity from childhood to late adolescence using a longitudinal sample of twins from ages 9 to 18 years. Motor impulsivity was assessed using errors of commission (no-go errors) in a visual go/no-go task at 4 time points: ages 9-10, 11-13, 14-15, and 16-18 years. Significant genetic and nonshared environmental effects on motor impulsivity were found at each of the 4 waves of assessment with genetic factors explaining 22%-41% of the variance within each of the 4 waves. Phenotypically, children's average performance improved across age (i.e., fewer no-go errors during later assessments). Multivariate biometric analyses revealed that common genetic factors influenced 12%-40% of the variance in motor impulsivity across development, whereas nonshared environmental factors common to all time points contributed to 2%-52% of the variance. Nonshared environmental influences specific to each time point also significantly influenced motor impulsivity. Overall, results demonstrated that although genetic factors were critical to motor impulsivity across development, both common and specific nonshared environmental factors played a strong role in the development of motor impulsivity across age.

    "abstract": "An association between male fertility and risk of prostate cancer has been suggested, possibly through lower androgen levels in subfertile men. We evaluated male fertility in relation to risk of prostate cancer by assessing the frequency of fathering of dizygotic twins, a marker of high fertility, among cases of prostate cancer and controls.\nWe performed a case-control study in Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe), a nationwide, population-based cohort. PCBaSe was linked to the Swedish twin register for information on zygosity for same-sex twins and to other nationwide health care registers and demographic databases for information on socioeconomic factors, comorbidity, and tumor characteristics for 96 301 prostate cancer cases and 378 583 matched controls. To account for the influence of in vitro fertilization on dizygotic twinning, analyses were restricted to men who had fathered children before 1991, when in vitro fertilization was still uncommon in Sweden.\n1 112 cases and 4 538 controls had fathered dizygotic twins. Men with dizygotic twins had no increased risk of prostate cancer compared to fathers of singletons; neither for total prostate cancer odds ratio (OR) 0.95(95% CI 0.89-1.02), nor for any risk category, OR 0.97 (95% CI 0.84-1.12) for low-risk disease, and OR 1.04 (95% CI 0.90-1.22) for metastatic disease.\nThe lack of association between fathering of dizygotic twins and prostate cancer risk give no support for an association between male fertility and prostate cancer risk.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of discordant phenotypic sex in monozygotic twins mosaic 47,XXY/46,XX: monozygotic heterokaryotypic twins. The twins presented with cognitive and comprehension delay, behavioural and language disorders, all symptoms frequently reported in Klinefelter syndrome. Molecular zygosity analysis with several markers confirmed that the twins are in effect monozygotic (MZ). Array comparative genomic hybridization found no evidence for the implication of copy number variation in the phenotypes. Ultrasound scans of the reproductive organs revealed no abnormalities. Endocrine tests showed a low testosterone level in Twin 1 (male phenotype) and a low gonadotrophin level in Twin 2 (female phenotype) which, combined with the results from ultrasound examination, provided useful information for potentially predicting the future fertility potential of the twins. Blood karyotypes revealed the presence of a normal 46,XX cell line and an aneuplo\u00efd 47,XXY cell line in both patients. Examination of the chromosome constitutions of various tissues such as blood, buccal smear and urinary sediment not surprisingly showed different proportions for the 46,XX and 47,XXY cell lines, which most likely explains the discordant phenotypic sex and mild Klinefelter features. The most plausible underlying biological mechanism is a post-zygotic loss of the Y chromosome in an initially 47,XXY zygote. This would result in an embryo with both 46,XX and 47,XXY cells lines which could subsequently divide into two monozygotic embryos through a twinning process. The two cell lines would then be distributed differently between tissues which could result in phenotypic discordances in the twins. These observations emphasize the importance of regular paediatric evaluations to determine the optimal timing for fertility preservation measures and to detect new Klinefelter features which could appear throughout childhood in the two subjects.",

    "abstract": "The equal environments assumption (EEA) of the twin method posits that environmental influences that are etiologically relevant to a given phenotype are no more likely to be shared by monozygotic (MZ) than dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. One method of testing the EEA is to evaluate whether increased rearing environment similarity in MZ twin pairs compared to DZ twin pairs is related to increased phenotypic correlation. In a sample of 885 twin pairs, we contrasted similarity in rearing environment between MZ and DZ twin pairs, examined the correlation between similarity in rearing environment and conduct disorder (CD), oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD), inattention, and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptom dimensions, and tested the effects of differential similarity in rearing environments between MZ and DZ twin pairs by testing whether rearing environment similarity moderated the correlations for the externalizing symptom dimensions. We found that MZ twins experienced substantially more similar rearing environments than DZ twins, but that there was little evidence that MZ and DZ correlations for the externalizing symptom dimensions varied by rearing environment similarity. Thus, these results constitute evidence for the validity of the EEA for childhood externalizing disorders.",

    "abstract": "Restrictive feeding is associated with childhood obesity; however, this could be due to other factors that drive children to overeat and parents to restrict (eg, child genetics). Using a twin design to better control for confounders, we tested differences in restrictive feeding within families in relation to differences in twins' self-regulatory eating and weight status.\nSixty-four same-gender twin pairs (4-7 years old) were studied with their mothers. Child caloric compensation ability (COMPX% index) was assessed by using a laboratory-based protocol. The Child Feeding Questionnaire assessed mothers' self-reported feeding styles toward each twin. Child BMI (kg/m(2)) and BMI z score were calculated by using measured weight and height; percent body fat and waist circumference were also assessed. Partial correlations examined within-twin pair differences in Child Feeding Questionnaire subscales in relation to within-twin pair differences in anthropometry and caloric compensation (COMPX%).\nDifferences in maternal restriction were significantly associated with within-pair differences in child COMPX% and BMI z score. Mothers reported more restriction toward the heavier and more poorly compensating twin. Additionally, within-pair differences in parental pressure to eat were associated with significant differences in BMI z score, percent body fat, and waist circumference. Mothers were more pressuring toward the lighter twin.\nMothers vary in their feeding practices, even among same-gender twin pairs, which might influence differences in adiposity. Future research needs to elucidate cause-and-effect and intervention implications regarding parental restriction and pressure-to-eat prompts.",

    "abstract": "Statistical power is one of the major concerns in genetic association studies. Related individuals such as twins are valuable samples for genetic studies because of their genetic relatedness. Phenotype similarity in twin pairs provides evidence of genetic control over the phenotype variation in a population. The genetic association study on human longevity, a complex trait that is under control of both genetic and environmental factors, has been confronted by the small sample sizes of longevity subjects which limit statistical power. Twin pairs concordant for longevity have increased probability for carrying beneficial genes and thus are useful samples for gene-longevity association analysis. We conducted a computer simulation to estimate the power of association study using longevity concordant twin pairs. We observed remarkable power increases in using singletons from longevity concordant twin pairs as cases in comparison with cases of sporadic proband. A similar power would require doubled sample sizes for fraternal twins than for identical twins who are concordant for longevity suggesting that longevity concordant identical twins are more efficient samples than fraternal twins. We also observed an approximate of 2- to 3-fold increase in sample sizes needed for longevity cutoff at age 90 as compared with that at age 95. Overall, our results showed high value of twins in genetic association studies on human longevity.",

    "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease, though the pathophysiologic mechanisms remain unclear. Carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis. We examined whether PTSD and combat exposure were associated with CIMT in Vietnam War-era twins after controlling for shared genetic and childhood factors. Between 2002 and 2010, we studied 465 middle-aged twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry who were free from cardiovascular disease. PTSD was diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and CIMT was measured by ultrasound. Mixed-effects regression models were used to examine individual, between-pair, and within-pair associations. Approximately 13% of participants met the criteria for PTSD, and 45% served in the Vietnam Theater. PTSD was associated with 32.7 \u03bcm higher CIMT (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9, 64.5) after adjustment for confounders. The average CIMT for the pair increased by 59.7 \u03bcm for each additional twin with PTSD (95% CI: 15.9, 104.2). We found no significant within-pair differences in CIMT when comparing PTSD-discordant co-twins. Results for combat exposure were similar, but its association with CIMT weakened after adjustment for PTSD (95% CI: 7.0, 45.3). Among Vietnam War-era veterans, combat exposure and PTSD are associated with CIMT, though the associations are largely mediated by shared childhood factors.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies occur one out of every 800. Due to the increase in maternal age and infertility, the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has risen. Thirty five percent of pregnancies solved using ART are twin pregnancies. A RT consists of infertility treatments in which oocytes and sperm are manipulated. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical behavior of premature twins born through ART versus those born after spontaneous conception (SC).\nRetrolective cohort study. The data was obtained from the records of preterm twins born between August 2010 and August 2013. Preterm twins were categorized in two groups: the ones conceived using ART versus those conceived through SC. Demographic characteristics and neonatal outcomes were compared.\nThe total was of 398 patients: 208 conceived in consequence of ART and 190 through SC. The primary outcome and neonatal morbidities showed no significant difference, only the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and the use of parenteral nutrition showed significant difference. The length of hospital stay between groups was similar.\nIn our population of preterm twins, the mode of conception had no detectable effect on mortality or short term morbidities.\nIntroducci\u00f3n: los embarazos gemelares ocurren una vez cada 800 embarazos. Debido al incremento en la edad materna y a la prevalencia de la infertilidad ha aumentado el uso de las t\u00e9cnicas de reproducci\u00f3n asistida (TRA). De los embarazos resueltos por medio de estas t\u00e9cnicas, 35 % son gemelares. Las TRA se definen como tratamientos de infertilidad en los que oocitos y espermatozoides son manipulados. El objetivo de este estudio consisti\u00f3 en comparar el comportamiento cl\u00ednico de los gemelos obtenidos por t\u00e9cnicas de reproducci\u00f3n asistida frente al de los gemelos obtenidos de manera espont\u00e1nea.

    "abstract": "Blood vessel resistance is assessed by flow velocity indexes. However, the actual resistance should be more strongly correlated with vessel diameter rather than variations in flow velocity. We aimed to determine the utility of middle cerebral artery (MCA) diameter measurement as a tool for evaluating brain sparing effect in intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) discordant twins.\nTen dichorionic-diamniotic twin pairs with weight discordance were included in the study. Fetal assessment included estimated fetal weight, umbilical artery flow, MCA flow and MCA diameter. Paired statistical analysis was used to compare MCA diameter and MCA pulsatility index (PI) between the discordant twins.\nMCA diameter was significantly larger in the smaller twin (mean diameter 3.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 vs 2.71\u2009\u00b1\u20090.22, P\u2009=\u20090.018, mean ratio 1.39\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14). There was no significant difference in MCA PI values within the twin pairs (mean PI 1.51\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13 vs 1.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07, P\u2009=\u20090.878, mean ratio 0.99\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11).\nMeasurement of MCA diameter can potentially be used as a tool for assessing vessel resistance. Further studies are needed to assess the feasibility and sensitivity of this method as well as the clinical significance of MCA dilatation in the presence of normal Doppler flow indexes.",

    "abstract": "Congenital primary hypothyroidism (CH) is a rare pediatric disorder estimated to occur in about 1:2,500 live births. Approximately half of these cases entail ectopic thyroid tissue, which is believed to result from a migration defect during embryogenesis. Approximately 3% of CH cases are explained by mutation(s) in known genes, most of which are transcription factors implicated in the embryology of the thyroid gland. Surprisingly, monozygotic (MZ) twins are usually discordant for CH due to thyroid dysgenesis, suggesting that most cases are not caused by transmitted genetic variation. One possible explanation is somatic mutation in genes involved in thyroid migration occurring after zygotic twinning. Such mutations should be observed only in the affected twin.\nTo test the hypothesis of somatic mutation, we performed whole exome sequencing of DNA from three pairs of MZ twins discordant for CH with ectopic glands.\nWe found no somatic mutations exclusive to any of the three affected twins or in any of the unaffected twins.\nEither somatic mutations are not significant for the etiology of CH or else such mutations lie outside regions of the genome accessible by exome sequencing technology.",

    "abstract": "Although few would now contest the presence of Gene \u00d7 Environment (G \u00d7 E) effects in the development of child psychopathology, it remains unclear how these effects manifest themselves. Alternative G \u00d7 E models have been proposed (i.e., diathesis-stress, differential susceptibility, bioecological), each of which has notably different implications for etiology. Child twin studies present a powerful tool for discriminating between these models. The current study examined whether and how parental involvement moderated etiological influences on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) within 500 twin pairs aged 6-11 years. Results indicated moderation of genetic and nonshared environmental contributions to ADHD by parental involvement, and moreover, suggested both differential susceptibility and bioecological models of G \u00d7 E. Results highlight the utility of child twin samples in testing different manifestations of G \u00d7 E effects.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to determine whether latitudinal (Queensland versus Tasmania) variation in reported disease frequency in Australia may be biased by differences in population.\nA retrospective analysis was conducted from data of two large Australian twin studies (n = 1,835) having undertaken ophthalmic examination, namely, Twins Eye Study in Tasmania (TEST) and the Brisbane Adolescent Twins Study (BATS). Ordinal logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios and predicted probabilities for each category of eye colour by state.\nTasmanian residence was associated with lower odds of darker iris colour (odds ratio 0.77, 95% CI [0.63-0.95]) signifying that participants living in Tasmania (TAS) are less likely to have darker-coloured irides than those residing in Queensland (QLD). For individuals living in Tasmania the predicted probability (TAS versus QLD) of having light blue eyes was greater (16.7 versus 13.3 per cent), approximately the same for green eyes and less for brown/dark brown-coloured eyes (6.2 versus 7.9 per cent).\nWe found a general trend of individuals living in the southern states (TAS/VIC) of Australia having lighter-coloured irides compared to those living in the north (QLD). This finding has potential implications for all epidemiological research conducted to explore differences in UV-associated disease frequency in Australia, as population heterogeneity may confound the estimates obtained.",

Peptides between 800 Da and 3,500 Da were captured and concentrated using C18 reversed-phase columns, followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The sequences of peptides associated with NAFLD were further identified by MALDI-TOF-TOF. Further validation studies were conducted. One hundred additional serum samples were detected by commercially available ELISA kits to calculate the concentrations of complement C3f and fibrinopeptide A, respectively. The differences of these two peptides in the NAFLD and control groups were compared using SPSS 17.0, respectively.\nCompared with healthy controls, eleven peaks (861.1, 877.07, 904.5, 1206.57, 1350.64, 1518.7, 1690.9, 1777.94, 2931.29, 3190.4, 3261.4) were up-regulated and 7 peaks (942.44, 1020.47, 1060.06, 1211.7, 1263.63, 1449.76, 2768.3) were down-regulated in the NAFLD group.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have reported associations between air pollution exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders in children, but the role of pre- and postnatal exposure has not been elucidated.\nWe aimed to explore the risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among children in relation to pre- and postnatal exposure to air pollution from road traffic.\nParents of 3,426 twins born in Stockholm during 1992-2000 were interviewed, when their children were 9 or 12 years old, for symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders. Residence time-weighted concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter <10 \u03bcm (PM10) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from road traffic were estimated at participants' addresses during pregnancy, the first year, and the ninth year of life using dispersion modeling, controlling for seasonal variation. Multivariate regression models were used to examine the association between air pollution exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes, adjusting for potential confounding factors.\nNo clear or consistent associations were found between air pollution exposure during any of the three time windows and any of the neurodevelopmental outcomes. For example, a 5-95% difference in exposure to NOx during pregnancy was associated with odds ratios (ORs) of 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44-1.96) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.58-1.40) for ASD and ADHD respectively. A corresponding range in exposure to PM10 during pregnancy was related to ORs of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.52-1.96) and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.68-1.47) for ASD and ADHD.\nOur data do not provide support for an association between pre- or postnatal exposure to air pollution from road traffic and neurodevelopmental disorders in children.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a genetically mediated disease with variable age of onset. In the pediatric age range, nonsyndromic TAA frequently has a milder course than syndromic forms of TAA, such as Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Herein, we describe 17-year-old identical twin brothers with severe progressive TAA due to a novel de novo ACTA2 mutation. Interestingly, both boys were diagnosed at age 11 with congenital mydriasis, a recently recognized manifestation of some ACTA2 mutations due to smooth muscle dysfunction. One of the brothers presented with acute-onset lower back pain that was identified as dissection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Imaging of the chest at this time showed severe fusiform TAA. Cardiac imaging in his twin showed similar TAA, but no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Both brothers underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement, but have had progressive aortic disease with recurrent dissection requiring multiple surgeries. This case emphasizes the importance of identifying physical stigmata of smooth muscle dysfunction, such as mydriasis, as potential markers for associated aortopathy and vascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cases of congenital absence of the cruciate ligaments are seen rarely in the literature. When reported, they are almost exclusively associated with various additional lower extremity deformities. We report the cases of 15-year-old monozygotic twin brothers. Both brothers presented with right knee pain and instability and were found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to have congenital absence of the right anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Examination of full length leg radiographs and MRI of the knee showed no associated abnormalities. Twin B previously underwent partial medial meniscectomy performed by an outside orthopaedic surgeon at which time the absence of the ACL was noted but not repaired. After diagnosis at our practice, both twins underwent arthroscopically assisted ACL construction with bone-patella-bone-autograft. Following recovery from surgery, both twins returned to high level athletics. These cases are among few reports of isolated congenital absence of the ACL, and to our knowledge there are no other cases of isolated congenital absence of the ACL in monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Congenital scoliosis due to vertebral anomalies may occur in less than 0.1% of the population. Several different theories have been put forth in the literature to account for the etiology of congenital scoliosis and the vertebral anomalies which contribute to its development. The study of scoliosis in twins has contributed to the understanding of causative factors including genetics, environment and in utero events during embryologic development. Case reports of fraternal (non-identical) juvenile male twins with congenital scoliosis associated with differing congenital vertebral anomalies are presented. Both children were asymptomatic at the time of the initial consultation and showed no signs of neurologic compromise. Rapidly progressive, severe genetic scoliosis requires prudent observation and referral to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon to determine appropriate options for care and to screen for potentially life threatening disorders. Chiropractors may be seen as gatekeepers for scoliosis and a thorough understanding of appropriate standards of care is required.\nLa scoliose cong\u00e9nitale due \u00e0 des anomalies vert\u00e9brales peut se produire chez moins de 0,1 % de la population. Plusieurs th\u00e9ories diff\u00e9rentes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9es dans la recherche scientifique pour expliquer l\u2019\u00e9tiologie de la scoliose cong\u00e9nitale et les anomalies vert\u00e9brales qui contribuent \u00e0 son d\u00e9veloppement. L\u2019\u00e9tude de la scoliose chez les jumeaux a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la compr\u00e9hension des facteurs \u00e9tiologiques, dont la g\u00e9n\u00e9tique, l\u2019environnement, et les \u00e9v\u00e9nements in utero au cours du d\u00e9veloppement embryonnaire. On pr\u00e9sente des rapports de cas de fr\u00e8res jumeaux (non identiques) mineurs atteints de scoliose cong\u00e9nitale associ\u00e9e \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes anomalies vert\u00e9brales cong\u00e9nitales. Les deux enfants \u00e9taient asymptomatiques au moment de la consultation initiale et n\u2019ont montr\u00e9 aucun signe d\u2019atteinte neurologique.

Les chiropraticiens peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des remparts contre la scoliose.

    "abstract": "In April 2009, a female chimpanzee named Sango, living in a captive group at the Noichi Zoo, Japan, gave birth to dizygotic male-female twin chimpanzees (male: Daiya, female: Sakura). The extent to which adult group members cared for the twins was investigated using a focal animal sampling method targeting six adults (one male) when the twin chimpanzees were two years old. Data were collected for an average of 6.78\u2005h (SD = 0.79) per focal participant. An unaffiliated female adult of Sango was engaged in parenting Sakura as much as Sango. Given that Sakura was in lesser proximity to Sango than Daiya, Sakura's departures from her mother and her ability to gesture requests might have enabled non-kin adults to provide her care.",

    "abstract": "Common obesity is a result of interaction between genes and environmental/lifestyle factors, with heritability estimates 40-70%. Not only the susceptibility to obesity but also the success of weight management depends on the genetic background of each individual. This paper summarizes the up-to-date knowledge on genetic causes of common obesities. Introduction of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) led to an identification of a total of 32 variants associated with obesity/BMI and 14 with body fat distribution. Further, a great progress in revealing the mechanisms regulating the energy balance was also noted. However, the proportion of explained variance for BMI is still low, suggesting other mechanisms such as gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, rare gene variants, copy number variants polymorphisms, or epigenetic modifications and microRNAs regulating gene transcription. In summary, we present results of our studies on obesity risk variants in Czech adults, children and adolescents including those evaluating the influence of selected gene variants on the outcomes of weight management.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of non-identical twins who presented with identical neonatal intestinal obstruction with features of anorectal stenosis, presacral mass and sacral anomaly consistent with Currarino's syndrome or triad. Plain sacral radiograph, contrast enema and MRI were diagnostic. Initial management involved a defunctioning colostomy followed by a posterior sagittal anorectoplasty with excision of the teratoma \u00b1 anterior sacral meningocele and finally closure of colostomy in a staged multidisciplinary approach. The twins' father is also affected with features of Currarino's syndrome but was diagnosed during family screening. Currarino's syndrome presenting with identical neonatal low intestinal obstruction in a non-identical set of twins is rare and interesting. Antenatal diagnosis of Currarino's syndrome is difficult and may prove to be a challenge even in the postnatal period. Sacral spine radiograph, contrast enema and MRI are diagnostic. Management requires high index of suspicion, low threshold for MRI and multidisciplinary staged approach.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to quantify the genetic and environmental contributions to oral disease and function in twins. Participants were middle-aged and old twins, 116 monozygotic and 16 dizygotic pairs whose mean age was 66\u00b71 \u00b1 10\u00b73 (SD) years. Number of teeth, percentage of decayed, filled and missing teeth and periodontal status were recorded as indicators of oral disease. The widths of upper and lower dental arch served as indicators of morphological figures. Furthermore, stimulated salivary flow rate, occlusal force and masticatory performance were measured as indicators of oral function. Univariate genetic analysis with monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs was conducted to detect the fittest structural equation model of each outcome. Both number of teeth and periodontal status fitted the model composed of common environmental factor and unique environmental factor. Decayed, filled and missing teeth, morphological figures and measurements of oral function fitted the model composed of additive genetic factor and unique environmental factor. The model fitting of each measurement suggested that periodontal disease was mainly affected by environmental factors, while morphological figures and oral functions were influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Microdeletion and microduplication syndromes without characteristic dysmorphic features are difficult to diagnose without chromosomal microarrays.\nWe describe the clinical course and genetic findings of monozygotic twins with intellectual disabilities and autistic features associated with mild facial dysmorphism and microdeletion of chromosome 3p14.\nThe postnatal course of the second twin was complicated by intestinal malrotation, whereas that of the first twin was unremarkable. Both twins had several mild dysmorphic features including upswept frontal hair, low-set posterior rotated ears, arched down-slanting eyebrows, prominent forehead, epicanthic folds, micrognathia, hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, short philtrum, and camptodactyly of the bilateral fifth fingers. They had autistic features such as poor eye contact and no social smile, stereotyped behaviors, and preference for solitary play. Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis revealed de novo 6.88-Mb deletions of 3p14 (chr3: 60,472,496-67,385,119) involving 17 genes in both twins. The deleted region contained 17 genes, five of which are known or presumed to be related to central nervous system disorders: FEZF2, SYNPR, ATXN7, PRICKLE2, and MAGI1.\nWe consider that PRICKLE2 is the most likely causative gene for the autistic features exhibited by these individuals.",

    "abstract": "We consider data from the Danish twin registry and aim to study in detail how lifetimes for twin-pairs are correlated. We consider models where we specify the marginals using a regression structure, here Cox's regression model or the additive hazards model. The best known such model is the Clayton-Oakes model. This model can be extended in several directions. One extension is to allow the dependence parameter to depend on covariates. Another extension is to model dependence via piecewise constant cross-hazard ratio models. We show how both these models can be implemented for large sample data, and suggest a computational solution for obtaining standard errors for such models for large registry data. In addition we consider alternative models that have some computational advantages and with different dependence parameters based on odds ratios of the survival function using the Plackett distribution. We also suggest a way of assessing how and if the dependence is changing over time, by considering either truncated or right-censored versions of the data to measure late or early dependence. This can be used for formally testing if the dependence is constant, or decreasing/increasing. The proposed procedures are applied to Danish twin data to describe dependence in the lifetimes of the twins. Here we show that the early deaths are more correlated than the later deaths, and by comparing MZ and DZ associations we suggest that early deaths might be more driven by genetic factors. This conclusion requires models that are able to look at more local dependence measures. We further show that the dependence differs for MZ and DZ twins and appears to be the same for males and females, and that there are indications that the dependence increases over calendar time.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often occur together. To obtain more insight in potential causes for the co-occurrence, this study examined the genetic and environmental etiology of the association between specific ASD and ADHD disorder dimensions. Self-reported data on ASD dimensions social and communication difficulties (ASDsc), and repetitive and restricted behavior and interests (ASDr), and ADHD dimensions inattention (IA), and hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI) were assessed in a community sample of 17,770 adult Swedish twins. Phenotypic, genetic and environmental associations between disorder dimensions were examined in a multivariate model, accounting for sex differences. ASDr showed the strongest associations with IA and HI in both sexes (r(p) 0.33 to 0.40). ASDsc also correlated moderately with IA (females r(p) 0.29 and males r(p) 0.35) but only modestly with HI (females r(p) 0.17 and males r(p) 0.20). Genetic correlations ranged from 0.22 to 0.64 and were strongest between ASDr and IA and HI. Sex differences were virtually absent. The ASDr dimension (reflecting restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests and activities) showed the strongest association with dimensions of ADHD, on a phenotypic, genetic and environmental level. This study opens new avenues for molecular genetic research. As our findings demonstrated that genetic overlap between disorders is dimension-specific, future gene-finding studies on psychiatric comorbidity should focus on carefully selected genetically related dimensions of disorders.",

The twin pairs were divided into two subgroups based on birth weight in each pair. The occurrence of ROP and severe ROP requiring treatment were compared between the lower birth weight infants and their co-twins with the higher birth weight. Some neonatal morbidities related to prematurity and neonatal characteristics were also compared between the twin pairs.\nBased on the univariate analysis, gestational age and birth weight were significantly associated with the occurrence and progression of ROP. But no significant differences in ROP between larger and smaller infants were observed in the twin-paired analysis. The incidence of neonatal morbidities regarding respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), sepsis and neonatal characteristics regarding gender distribution, one- and five-minute Apgar score, postnatal steroid treatment, blood transfusion, supplemental oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation were not different between the twins. However, gestational age of \u226428wk was significantly associated with significantly higher rates of ROP and severe ROP.\nGestational age is a better predictor of ROP than birth weight in the twin-paired study.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol consumption is influenced by heritable factors. The genetic influence on usual high-density drinking, including alcohol intoxication and hangover, is unknown. We aim to estimate the heritability of usual high-density drinking.\nA total of 13,511 male twins in this cross-sectional study were included from the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS-NRC) Twin Registry. Data on the frequency of alcohol intoxication and alcohol hangover over the past year, that is, usual high-density drinking (phenotypes), were collected through a self-administered questionnaire when twins were middle-aged in 1972. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate the variance components of phenotypes.\nThe mean of the frequency of usual high-density drinking in the entire twin population was 0.16 times per month for intoxication and 0.18 times per month for hangover. The heritability of usual alcohol intoxication was 50.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 46.2 to 55.0) before and 49.9% (95% CI 45.3 to 54.2) after the body mass index (BMI) adjustment. The heritability of usual hangover was 55.4% (95% CI 51.2 to 58.6) before and 54.8% (95% CI 50.6 to 58.8) after adjustment for BMI. Unshared environmental factors between co-twins explained the remaining variance in alcohol intoxication and in hangover.\nBoth genetic and unshared environmental factors have important influences on usual alcohol intoxication and hangover. These findings are important in understanding the occurrence of and developing interventions for usual high-density drinking.",

    "abstract": "To describe neonatal and obstetrical prognosis in dichorionic (DC) twins with a birth weight discordance under 20% and evaluate the influence of intrauterine growth restriction on the management.\nWe studied retrospectively 67 DC twins birth between July 2002 and July 2012 at our university labour ward. Birth weight discordance was considered slight between 20-25%, moderate between 25-30%, and severe over 30%.\nPrevalence of birth weight discordance in DC twins is estimated at 11.4% in our study. Eighty percent of severe discordance was diagnosed before delivery, 41% for moderate discordance and 20% for slight discordance. We note 30% of pre eclampsia in our population with 44% in the severe discordance group. Mean gestational age was 35.1 weeks for slight and moderate discordances, and 33 weeks for severe discordance. Caesarean section rate was 48% for severe discordance and only 36% for slight discordance. Vaginal delivery rate is 56.7%. More than half of patient with a severe discordance gave birth vaginally. Intrauterine growth restriction rate under the 10th percentile was 18.7%. Prevalence of IUGR was 24% in sever discordance group, 23.5% in the moderate discordance group and 10% in the slight group. Neonatal morbidity rate was 20.8% mainly in children with IUGR.\nNeonatal mortality and morbidity rate are mainly increased in severe discordant twins. These pregnancies are at high risk of maternal morbidity. Vaginal delivery must be preferred for slight and moderate discordances. In case of severe discordance, vaginal delivery should be considered depending on the degree of intrauterine growth retardation.",

    "abstract": "A 7-year-old child presented with atypical absence epilepsy. He also had autism and severe cognitive deficit. As part of his diagnostic workup, a chromosomal microarray analysis was performed, which showed novel biallelic deletions in the neurexin 1 gene (NRXN1). His fraternal twin sister, who also had autism and cognitive impairment, was subsequently found to have the same biallelic deletions. Deletions included a 272-282kb loss at band 2p16.3 in one allele and a smaller 135-174-kb loss on the second allele. Neurexin 1 (NRXN1) is a cell adhesion protein, forming a synaptic complex with neuroligin. This signals a pathway that is critical for activity-dependent synaptic transmission. Mutations in this gene have been associated with autism and neurodevelopmental delay. Although there are many reports of heterozygous mutations with variable expressivity, only 3 cases with biallelic NRXN1 mutations have been previously reported, all of which have a more severe phenotype. We report 2 siblings with biallelic deletions, both of which affect the promoter region and exons 1-5 in the \u03b1-NRXN1 isoform, which has a role in the Ca(2+)-dependent release of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Our cases expand the phenotype of biallelic \u03b1 NRXN 1 mutations and emphasize the important role of NRXN1 in autism and intellectual disability. Chromosomal microarray analysis should be the clinical standard in all specialties for first-tier genetic testing in autistic spectrum disorders.",

    "abstract": "The innate immune response from diamniotic and dichorionic twin brothers congenitally infected with Trypanosoma. cruzi (strain DTU-V) who displayed different clinical symptomatology was studied. While Brother I manifested severe cardiac and digestive disorders, the Brother II showed slight splenomegaly. The secretion level of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, IL-10, IFN-\u03b1 and IL-6 cytokines produced after stimulation of peripheral blood cells with TLR-2, TLR-4 and TLR-9 ligands was determined pre- and post-benznidazole treatment. Cells from 10 uninfected infants born to mothers seropositive for Chagas disease were included as control. The obtained data show that the cells of Brother I secreted lower levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 (upon TLR-2 and TLR-4 stimulation) relative to those secreted by cells from Brother II and uninfected controls. The cells from Brother II secreted high levels of the IL-1\u03b2 cytokine following TLR-2 stimulation relative to uninfected controls. The cells from both brothers secreted a higher level of IL-6, following TLR-4 stimulation, than that secreted by uninfected infant cells. After treatments, the cytokine secretion levels were similar in both children and comparable to those of uninfected donors. Treatment success in Brother I and treatment interruption in Brother II was detected by the use of serological biomarkers (KMP11, HSP70, PFR2, Tgp63) as well as follow-up done by PCR. Therefore, the Brother II required a second treatment. The data presented suggest that benznidazol treatment allows the innate immune system to reach a fully functional status similar to that of uninfected subjects.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have identified the relationship between parental loss and psychopathology later in life. However, this relationship varied depending on the kind of loss, the parent involved, and the type of psychopathology. In the present study, we examined the association between parental loss (any loss, death, and separation) during childhood and lifetime risk for seven common psychiatric and substance use disorders in a sample of 2605 male twins from the Virginia population-based twin registry. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we also examined the extent to which the influence of parental loss contributes to adult psychopathology. Parental separation was associated with a wide range of adult psychopathology, whereas parental death was specifically associated with phobia and alcohol dependence. Maternal and paternal separations were almost equally associated with most forms of psychopathology. SEM suggested that parental loss accounted for about 10% of the variance of adult psychopathology, of which parental separation had the strongest impacts on risk for depression and drug abuse/dependence (11% of the total variance). Our findings suggest that early parental separation has stronger and wider effects on adult psychopathology than parental death.",

    "abstract": "The present study aims to analyze perinatal outcomes in twins given special care during pregnancy and labor and to compare fetal and neonatal outcomes in dichorionic twins with monochorionic twins.\nEighty eight (88) twin pregnancies booked for care at a tertiary care Fetal Medicine centre were included in this study. The maternal demographic variables, course of pregnancy, fetal problems, and specialized fetal therapeutic and diagnostic interventions were noted. The above parameters were compared in the sub-groups of dichorionic and monochorionic twin pregnancies and related to the perinatal outcome. Statistical analysis was done using the student's t test and the two-tailed chi sqaure tests with Yate's continuity correction. A p value <0.05 was considered as significant.\nMean maternal age was 30.34\u00a0+\u00a04.81\u00a0years (range 19-48). 81\u00a0% of the twins were DCDA, and 19\u00a0% were MCDA. The mean gestational age at delivery was 34.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5\u00a0weeks, and this was not significantly different in MCDA and DCDA groups. Serious fetal problems warranting intervention at the time of initial referral were significantly higher in MCDA twins although overall perinatal outcome in both groups were not different.\nSpecialized care during pregnancy and labor including active fetal surveillance and therapeutic intervention when indicated improves the perinatal outcome in twin pregnancies and ensured at least one healthy live birth in over 90\u00a0% cases, although with an increase in late prematurity.",

    "abstract": "Head motion (HM) is a critical confounding factor in functional MRI. Here we investigate whether HM during resting state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) is influenced by genetic factors in a sample of 462 twins (65% female; 101 MZ (monozygotic) and 130 DZ (dizygotic) twin pairs; mean age: 21 (SD = 3.16), range 16-29). Heritability estimates for three HM components-mean translation (MT), maximum translation (MAXT) and mean rotation (MR)-ranged from 37 to 51%. We detected a significant common genetic influence on HM variability, with about two-thirds (genetic correlations range 0.76-1.00) of the variance shared between MR, MT and MAXT. A composite metric (HM-PC1), which aggregated these three, was also moderately heritable (h(2) = 42%). Using a sub-sample (N = 35) of the twins we confirmed that mean and maximum translational and rotational motions were consistent \"traits\" over repeated scans (r = 0.53-0.59); reliability was even higher for the composite metric (r = 0.66). In addition, phenotypic and cross-trait cross-twin correlations between HM and resting state functional connectivities (RS-FCs) with Brodmann areas (BA) 44 and 45, in which RS-FCs were found to be moderately heritable (BA44: h(2) = 0.23 (sd = 0.041), BA45: h(2) = 0.26 (sd = 0.061)), indicated that HM might not represent a major bias in genetic studies using FCs. Even so, the HM effect on FC was not completely eliminated after regression. HM may be a valuable endophenotype whose relationship with brain disorders remains to be elucidated.",

    "abstract": "Based on evidence linking creativity and bipolar disorder, a model has been proposed whereby factors influencing liability to bipolar disorder confer certain traits with positive effects on reproductive fitness. The authors tested this model by examining key traits known to be associated with evolutionary fitness, namely, temperament and neurocognition, in individuals carrying liability for bipolar disorder. Schizophrenia probands and their co-twins were included as psychiatric controls.\nTwin pairs discordant for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and control pairs were identified through the Swedish Twin Registry. The authors administered a neuropsychological test battery and temperament questionnaires to samples of bipolar probands, bipolar co-twins, schizophrenia probands, schizophrenia co-twins, and controls. Multivariate mixed-model analyses of variance were conducted to compare groups on temperament and neurocognitive scores.\nBipolar co-twins showed elevated scores on a \"positivity\" temperament scale compared with controls and bipolar probands, while bipolar probands scored higher on a \"negativity\" scale compared with their co-twins and controls, who did not differ. Additionally, bipolar co-twins showed superior performance compared with controls on tests of verbal learning and fluency, while bipolar probands showed performance decrements across all neurocognitive domains. In contrast, schizophrenia co-twins showed attenuated impairments in positivity and overall neurocognitive functioning relative to their ill proband counterparts.\nThese findings suggest that supra-normal levels of sociability and verbal functioning may be associated with liability for bipolar disorder. These effects were specific to liability for bipolar disorder and did not apply to schizophrenia. Such benefits may provide a partial explanation for the persistence of bipolar illness in the population.",

    "abstract": "Objective. Our objective was to estimate degree and rate of discordant growth and its impact on perinatal outcome in dichorionic twin pregnancies conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) compared to those conceived spontaneously. Study Design. Growth discordance was defined as 90th percentiles for the study population. Adverse perinatal outcome was defined as 5-minute Apgar score <7 and/or admission to neonatal intensive care unit. Results. In the total study population of dichorionic twins (176 conceived by IVF and 215 spontaneously), 30% discordant growth represented the 90th percentile. After adjusting for gestational age, discordant twins conceived by IVF or spontaneously were at higher risk for adverse perinatal outcome (hazard ratio 4.4; 95% CI 2.4-8.3, P < 0.0001; hazard ratio 2.5; 95% CI 1.5-4.4, P = 0.001, resp.). Similar rates of 5-minute Apgar score <7, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, and delivery <34 weeks were found between discordant twins conceived by IVF and those conceived spontaneously. Conclusion. Dichorionic twins conceived by IVF are at similar risk for the rate and degree of discordant growth and adverse perinatal outcome compared to dichorionic twins conceived spontaneously.",

    "abstract": "We present clinical, neuropathological, and molecular genetic findings of a family with a new pain phenotype of the sodium channel gene SCN9A polymorphism R1150W. A 46-year-old woman presented with a 5-year history of episodic temperature- and exercise-dependent burning pain of the feet and lower legs associated with numbness of the distal upper and lower limbs. Her monozygotic twin sister and their mother and her twin presented similar symptoms. Clinical evaluation was normal except for a mild distal sensory deficit in fingers and feet. Electrophysiological testing was unremarkable, as were serum and cerebrospinal fluid laboratory findings. Skin biopsies of the distal lower limbs revealed an epidermal nerve fiber density at the lower limit of normal. Myelinated dermal nerve fibers showed elongated nodes of Ranvier, but normal distribution of nodal and paranodal proteins. Genetic testing for ion channel-associated pain disorders revealed an amino acid R1150W substitution of the Nav1.7 sodium channel. The combination of a Nav1.7 polymorphism with dysmyelinating features in small-caliber peripheral nerves has not been described before and may suggest an explanation for the clinical syndrome in our patients. Treatment with the sodium channel blocker lamotrigine provided some relief, consistent with a role of sodium channel dysfunction in the pain syndrome of this family.",

    "abstract": "Aiming to perform the first sociological survey of Hungarian twins, our main question was whether being a twin has positive consequences on one's life. Adult twins completed our questionnaire at three Hungarian summer twin festivals, in hospitals during medical twin studies, and on some websites online. Data represent 140 twin pairs (mean age: 38.2 \u00b1 14.6 years). We employed some indices for measuring the resource nature of twinship. Three main types of benefits were distinguished: profit of attraction, as 'material capital'; the easier obtainability of cultural goods when twins take part in it, as 'cultural capital'; and positive aspects of an a priori existing dyadic relation, as 'relational capital'. We were interested in the difference among types of twins regarding advantages. We paid special attention to the five groups of twins derived from gender and zygosity (i.e., monozygotic females, monozygotic males, dizygotic females, dizygotic males, opposite-sex pairs). Our analysis showed that Hungarian twins involved in our research basically enjoy their twinship; during their lives they used and still make use of different benefits given by it. In our twin samples, women had more advantages from being a twin than men. Significant differences could be observed on all indicators between monozygotic and dizygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed at investigating the impact of late prematurity (LPT) on neonatal outcome in twins and neonatal morbidity and mortality within LPT with regard to the completed weeks of gestation. The study was conducted in six tertiary obstetric departments from different provinces of Poland (Warsaw, Lublin, Poznan, Wroclaw, Bytom). It included 465 twin deliveries in the above centers in 2012. A comparative analysis of maternal factors, the course of pregnancy and delivery and neonatal outcome between LPT (34 + 0-36 + 6 weeks of gestation) and term groups (completed 37 weeks) was performed. The neonatal outcome included short-term morbidities. The analysis of neonatal complication rates according to completed gestational weeks was carried out. Out of 465 twin deliveries 213 (44.8%) were LPT and 156 (33.55%) were term. There were no neonatal deaths among LPT and term twins. One-third of LPT newborns suffered from respiratory disorders or required antibiotics, 40% had jaundice requiring phototherapy, and 30% were admitted to NICU. The analysis of neonatal morbidity with regard to each gestational week at delivery showed that most analyzed complications occurred less frequently with the advancing gestational age, especially respiratory disorders and NICU admissions. The only two factors with significant influence on neonatal morbidity rate were neonatal birth weight (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.2-0.9, p = .02) and gestational age at delivery (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.5-0.8, p < .01). LPT have a higher risk of neonatal morbidity than term twins. Gestational age and neonatal birth weight seem to play a crucial role in neonatal outcome in twins.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a set of diseases that exhibit not only genetic mutations but also a profoundly distorted epigenetic landscape. Over the last two decades, great advances have been made in identifying these alterations and their importance in the initiation and progression of cancer. Epigenetic changes can be seen from the very early stages in tumorigenesis and dysregulation of the epigenome has an increasingly acknowledged pathogenic role. Epigenomic twin studies have great potential to contribute to our understanding of complex diseases, such as cancer. This is because the use of monozygotic twins discordant for cancer enables epigenetic variation analysis without the confounding influence of the constitutive genetic background, age or cohort effects. It therefore allows the identification of susceptibility loci that may be sensitive to modification by the environment. These studies into cancer etiology will potentially lead to robust epigenetic markers for the detection and risk assessment of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Numerous theoretical reasons have been posited about why more schooling might improve health. Adult health outcomes and behaviors generally are significantly associated with schooling. However, such associations do not necessarily imply that schooling has causal effects on health outcomes and behaviors. Causal estimates based on schooling variation from policies and from within-MZ (monozygotic) twins have reached mixed conclusions. This study contributed new estimates of cross-sectional associations and within-MZ causal effects using three relatively large US twins samples. The estimates suggested that schooling was significantly associated with numerous health outcomes and behaviors. However, with within-MZ twins control for unobserved factors, schooling was no longer associated with most indicators of better health (with the exception of self-reported health), while it continued to be associated with outcomes such as fertility and spousal schooling. Similar patterns were observed for spousal schooling.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of twins with epilepsy to explore the genetic architecture of specific epilepsies, to evaluate the applicability of the 2010 International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) organization of epilepsy syndromes, and to integrate molecular genetics with phenotypic analyses.\nA total of 558 twin pairs suspected to have epilepsy were ascertained from twin registries (69%) or referral (31%). Casewise concordance estimates were calculated for epilepsy syndromes. Epilepsies were then grouped according to the 2010 ILAE organizational scheme. Molecular genetic information was utilized where applicable.\nOf 558 twin pairs, 418 had confirmed seizures. A total of 534 twin individuals were affected. There were higher twin concordance estimates for monozygotic (MZ) than for dizygotic (DZ) twins for idiopathic generalized epilepsies (MZ = 0.77; DZ = 0.35), genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (MZ = 0.85; DZ = 0.25), and focal epilepsies (MZ = 0.40; DZ = 0.03). Utilizing the 2010 ILAE scheme, the twin data clearly demonstrated genetic influences in the syndromes designated as genetic. Of the 384 tested twin individuals, 10.9% had mutations of large effect in known epilepsy genes or carried validated susceptibility alleles.\nTwin studies confirm clear genetic influences for specific epilepsies. Analysis of the twin sample using the 2010 ILAE scheme strongly supported the validity of grouping the \"genetic\" syndromes together and shows this organizational scheme to be a more flexible and biologically meaningful system than previous classifications. Successful selected molecular testing applied to this cohort is the prelude to future large-scale next-generation sequencing of epilepsy research cohorts. Insights into genetic architecture provided by twin studies provide essential data for optimizing such approaches.",

    "abstract": "Advances in developmental biology have shown that monozygous twins may not be as phenotypically identical as once believed, and the mechanisms responsible for such differences are now becoming clearer. Whether such phenotypic differences are capable of triggering graft rejection of an organ transplanted between identical twins remains unknown but the risks seem low, and long-term transplant outcome is excellent. Available evidence to guide immunosuppressive therapy in this setting is limited but a prudent approach would include the use of steroids together with a calcineurin inhibitor after transplantation. However, once the inevitable inflammatory response associated with transplant surgery has resolved, cautious reduction and eventually withdrawal of immunosuppression should be possible.",

    "abstract": "High anisometropic myopia is a rare condition in twins. Genetic factors have been implicated in its development and there may be an association with vision-threatening complications. A pair of 11-year-old twins presented with poor distance vision in both eyes. Detailed ocular examination was performed including slit lamp examination, dilated funduscopy, cycloplegic refraction, keratometry and axial length measurement. The objective refraction was -6.50 DS -2.00 DC \u00d7 180 (right eye), -1.00 DS (left eye) for the first twin; -13.75 DS -2.25 DC \u00d7 180 (right eye), -0.50 DS -0.75 DC \u00d7 04 (left eye) for the second twin.

    "abstract": "In contrast to the postnatal period, little is known about telomere length (TL) during prenatal life. The decrease in placental TL remains unknown, although intra uterine growth retardation and preeclampsia are associated with shorter placental TL. The aim of this study is to assess the decrease of placental TL during the third trimester of gestation and to explore the role of potential \"growth influencing factors\".\nThe study sample consisted of 329 live-born twins from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. TL was determined using a multiplex quantitative PCR method. Gestational age, sex, birth order, placental characteristics, parity, maternal and paternal age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, alcohol use, and socio economic status (SES) were considered \"growth influencing factors\". Bivariable multilevel regression analysis with \"growth influencing factors\" was performed.\nPlacental TL ranged from 4.3\u00a0kbp to 84.4\u00a0kbp with a median of 10.8\u00a0kbp. Ln(TL) decreased in a linear fashion with an estimated TL decreasing from 13.98\u00a0kbp at 28 weeks to 10.56\u00a0kbp at 42 weeks. The regression coefficient of gestational age became smaller if considered together with SES (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.017; p\u00a0=\u00a00.08) or diabetes (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.018; p\u00a0=\u00a00.07) and bigger if considered together with parity (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.022; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), indicating that part of the association between gestational age and telomere length is explained by these three confounding factors.\nPlacental TL decreases during the third trimester of gestation of live-born twins with approximately 25% indicating that telomere shortening may play a role in aging of the placenta.",

Anthropometric data were also recorded.\nIn children AD-SoS and BTT were positively correlated with age (r = 0.91, r = 0.91), height (r = 0.88, r = 0.90) and weight (r = 0.81, r = 0.87); in adults AD-SoS was negatively related to age (r = -0.36), AD-SoS and BTT were positively related to height (r = 0.37, r = 0.58). Absolute value differences between twins for AD-SoS and BTT were significantly higher in adult twins (25.9 \u00b1 21.9 for AD-SoS and 0.08 \u00b1 0.08 for BTT) than in children (14.5 \u00b1 12.4 for AD-SoS and 0.05 \u00b1 0.04 for BTT).\nDifferentiation in bone tissue quality in twins increases with age, probably reflecting lifestyle, personal habits, likely acting through epigenetic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral genetic research has been conducted at the University of Warsaw for the past 20 years. The work done at the University focuses primarily on the origins of individual differences in temperament and other personality traits. In particular, research is directed toward the traits postulated in the Regulative Theory of Temperament. We also focused on the heritability of socio-political attitudes, risk factors for human health, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The majority of the research that has been carried out is grounded in twin and family studies, although recent work based on molecular techniques has also been developed. This article reviews the most important directions and findings of behavioral genetics research at the University of Warsaw.",

    "abstract": "Compared with singletons, what is the parent mental health, parent-child and couple relationship satisfaction, and child adjustment of 6- to 12-year-old assisted reproduction technology (ART) twins and their families?\nThere are no differences between 6- and 12-year-old ART twin and singleton families in parent mental health or family relationships; however, twins had significantly fewer behavior and attention problems than singletons in middle childhood.\nWhen ART twins are younger than 5 years old, parents have more mental health difficulties and poorer parent-child relationship quality, and no differences have been found in ART twin and singletons' psychosocial adjustment. However, studies have only examined the implications of ART twin status in families with infant and toddler aged children.\nA cross-sectional study of 300 6-12-year-old ART children (n = 124 twins and n = 176 singletons) from 206 families at a reproductive endocrinology clinic in the USA.\nPatients from one clinic with a child born between 1998 and 2004 were invited to participate in an online survey (82% recruitment rate). Participants provided information on each 6- to 12-year-old ART child in the family, and responded to questions on parent mental health, family relationships and child adjustment.\nThere were no differences in parent mental health or family relationships in families with 6- to 12-year-old ART twins versus singletons. However, twins (M = 2.40, SE = 0.35) had significantly fewer behavior problems than singletons (M = 3.47, SE = 0.36; F(1, 201) = 4.54, b = 1.08, P < 0.05). Twins (M = 1.86, SD = 0.23) also had fewer attention problems than singletons (M = 2.64, SD = 0.23; F(1, 156) = 5.75, b = 0.78, P < 0.05). Results also suggest that full-term twins had significantly fewer attention problems (M = 1.37, SE = 0.33; F(1, 222) = 2.65, P = 0.05) than premature twins (M = 2.32, SE = 0.32, b = 0.95, P < 0.05), full-term singletons (M = 2.25, SE = 0.21, b = 0.88, P < 0.05) and premature singletons (M = 2.84, SE = 0.49, b = 1.47, P = 0.01). There were no significant differences between the other groups.\nAlthough the response rate is high (82%) and family demographics are representative of US ART patients, patients are from one US clinic. Responses also are from one family member and may be subject to social desirability biases. Additionally, our data did not include identification of monozygotic and dizygotic twins.\nStudies on infant and toddler ART twins suggest these families have parents with more mental health difficulties and lower parent-child relationship quality than singleton families. This study indicates the negative effects of twin status may have ameliorated by middle childhood, and twins may even have more optimum psychosocial adjustment than singletons in this developmental period.\nThis research is based on a collaborative research effort supported by University of Minnesota Agriculture Experiment Station Project Number MN-52-107, a University of Minnesota Grant-in-Aid of Research, Artistry and Scholarship grant, a University of Minnesota College of Education and Human Development Research Development Investment Grant and the M.

    "abstract": "Because of lack of evidence, we aimed to examine to what degree low-grade systemic inflammation and coronary heart disease (CHD) death shared common genetic and environmental substrates.\nFrom the 41-year prospective National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Twin Study, we included 950 middle-aged male twins at baseline (1969-1973). Low-grade systemic inflammation was measured with plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein. Univariate and bivariate structural equation models were used, adjusted for a risk score for CHD death. The score-adjusted heritability was 19% for IL-6, 27% for C-reactive protein, and 22% for CHD death. The positive phenotypic correlation of IL-6 with CHD death (radjusted=0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08-0.43) was driven by additive genetic factors (contribution [relative contribution], 0.30 [111%]) but attenuated by unique environment (-0.03 [-11%]). The genetic correlation between IL-6 and CHD death was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.21-1.00), whereas the unique environmental correlation was -0.05 (95% CI, -0.35 to 0.25). The proportion of genetic variance for CHD death shared with that for IL-6 was 74%. The phenotypic correlation of C-reactive protein with CHD death (radjusted=0.10; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.22) was explained by additive genetic factors (0.20 [149%]) but was attenuated by the unique environment (-0.09 [-49%]). The genetic correlation of C-reactive protein with CHD death was 0.63 (95% CI, -0.07 to 1.00), whereas the unique environmental correlation was -0.07 (95% CI, -0.29 to 0.17).\nLow-grade systemic inflammation, measured by IL-6, and long-term CHD death share moderate genetic substrates that augment both traits.",

    "abstract": "Until recently, all twin pregnancies were treated in a similar fashion. Ultrasounds were undertaken every 3 to 4 weeks to assess serial fetal growth. Monochorionic (MC) twins comprise only 20% of all twin pregnancies yet unique complications such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence, twin anemia-polycythemia sequence, and selective intrauterine growth restriction can occur. In addition, the in utero death of one twin of a MC pair poses significant risks for death or severe neurologic morbidity in the cotwin. With the exception of discordant growth, these complications are not seen in dichorionic twinning due to the lack of placental anastomoses. In the last two decades, new technologies such as laser photocoagulation for the treatment of severe TTTS and radiofrequency ablation and bipolar cautery for selective reduction have markedly improved outcomes for many of the complications of MC twins. Thus, stratification of \"low-risk\" twinning (dichorionic twins) versus \"high-risk\" twinning (MC twins) is paramount to improved outcomes. This can be easily and accurately accomplished with first trimester ultrasound by evaluating the interface of the intertwin membrane with the placenta. This should now be the standard of care for all multiple gestations.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this twin case comparison was to assess the short- and long-term effects of nonsurgical treatment vs orthognathic surgical treatment for Class II correction. Two identical twins (age 13 years 3 months) were treated for Class II correction where one patient was treated nonsurgically using a fixed functional appliance, while the other was treated using orthognathic mandibular advancement surgery. The patients were recalled and evaluated 5 years in retention. Comparing changes in the short and long term, surgical treatment led to superior skeletal results compared to the nonsurgical twin. However, the soft tissue profile was remarkably similar for both patients suggesting that soft tissue profile changes may not necessarily follow similar changes in the bony skeletal structures.",

    "abstract": "Identical Caucasian male twins, previously fit, presented 1\u2005week apart with short histories of fever and lethargy. The twins were febrile at presentation with profound pancytopaenia and evidence of haemolysis. There was no rash or arthralgia. Both required multiple red cell transfusions. The twins had positive IgM serology for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and parvovirus B19. EBV viral capsid antigen and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen IgGs were also positive however, suggesting past EBV exposure. Parvovirus B19 DNA was detected from peripheral blood PCR; CMV and EBV DNA PCRs were negative. Convalescent serology demonstrated no evolution of the CMV serological response, that is no IgG to CMV developed which implies an initial non-specific polyclonal IgM response. The twins recovered fully over 7\u2005days, the first with a course of prednisolone and the second spontaneously. They were diagnosed with hereditary spherocytosis on convalescent blood films. On further questioning, a family history of hereditary spherocytosis was eventually revealed. The twins' maternal grandmother was known to have the condition asymptomatically. Their mother had prior to this never been tested, but later bloods would reveal a compatible biochemical picture.",

    "abstract": "We describe a monozygotic twin discordant for VATER association with single dysplastic kidney and cloacal anomaly, who had no pulmonary hypoplasia. This twin probably had little or no urine output in utero, but still had normal lung development due to production of adequate amniotic fluid by the healthy twin preventing pulmonary hypoplasia. The discordance between monozygotic twins for VATER association indicates that factors other than inherited genetic ones may have a role in the causation of this association.",

    "abstract": "To determine the heritability of spine curve using plain radiographs and to identify risk factors for spine curvature including age, body mass index, smoking, bone mineral density (BMD), and lumbar disc degeneration (LDD).\nA classical twin study of 110 MZ and 136 DZ adult female twins. Demographic and clinical information obtained from long spine radiographs, lumbar spine degeneration on spine MR scan, and BMD assessed by DEXA at hip and lumbar spine were included in multiple logistic regression models to determine risk factors for spine curvature.\nHeritability estimates ranged between 41 (19-59) % for pelvic incidence to 61 (46-72) % for thoracic kyphosis; with lumbar lordosis and cervical lordosis having 59 (42-71) % and 43 (23-59) % heritability, respectively. For each spine curve, the model showing the best fit contained additive genetic and shared environmental components with no contribution from the unique environment. Significant risk factors for increased thoracic kyphosis were lumbar spine BMD, age, and cervical lordosis; for pelvic incidence were lumbar spine BMD and lumbar lordosis; for lumbar lordosis were cervical lordosis, pelvic incidence and LDD; and age alone predicted cervical lordosis (p = 0.001).\nIn this sample of middle-aged and elderly women, there were significant genetic influences on all spine curves but particularly thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis. The strongest predictor for lumbar lordosis was LDD (p < 0.0001) which is itself genetically determined in part. For thoracic kyphosis, BMD was strongly associated and remained so (for lumbar BMD) with the inclusion of age, showing BMD to be an independent risk factor. This work highlights the genetic factors influencing normal spine curvature in women.",

    "abstract": "Evidence from twin studies points to substantial environmental influences on intelligence, but the specifics of this influence are unclear. This study examined one developmental process that potentially causes intelligence differences: learning to read. In 1,890 twin pairs tested at 7, 9, 10, 12, and 16 years, a cross-lagged monozygotic-differences design was used to test for associations of earlier within-pair reading ability differences with subsequent intelligence differences. The results showed several such associations, which were not explained by differences in reading exposure and were not restricted to verbal cognitive domains. The study highlights the potentially important influence of reading ability, driven by the nonshared environment, on intellectual development and raises theoretical questions about the mechanism of this influence.",

    "abstract": "In eutherian mammals and in humans, the female fetus may be masculinized while sharing the intra-uterine environment with a male fetus. Telomere length (TL), as expressed in leukocytes, is heritable and is longer in women than in men. The main determinant of leukocyte TL (LTL) is LTL at birth. However, LTL is modified by age-dependent attrition.\nWe studied LTL dynamics (LTL and its attrition) in adult same-sex (monozygotic, n\u2009=\u2009268; dizygotic, n\u2009=\u2009308) twins and opposite-sex (n\u2009=\u2009144) twins. LTL was measured by Southern blots of the terminal restriction fragments.\nWe observed that in same-sex (both monozygotic and dizygotic) twins, as reported in singletons, LTL was longer in females than in males [estimate\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error (SE):163\u2009\u00b1\u200963\u2009bp, P\u2009<\u20090.01]. However, in opposite-sex twins, female LTL was indistinguishable from that of males (-31\u2009\u00b1\u200952\u2009bp, P\u2009=\u20090.6), whereas male LTL was not affected. Findings were similar when the comparison was restricted to opposite-sex and same-sex dizygotic twins (females relative to males: same-sex: 188\u2009\u00b1\u200990\u2009bp, P\u2009<\u20090.05; other-sex: -32\u2009\u00b1\u200964\u2009bp, P\u2009=\u20090.6).\nThese findings are compatible with masculinization of the female fetus in opposite-sex twins. They suggest that the sex difference in LTL, seen in the general population, is largely determined in utero, perhaps by the intrauterine hormonal environment. Further studies in newborn twins are warranted to test this thesis.",

    "abstract": "Adolescent alcohol abuse is associated with adverse outcomes in early adulthood, but differences in familial status and structure and household and community environments correlate with both adolescent drinking and adverse adult outcomes and may explain their association. We studied drinking-discordant twin pairs to evaluate such confounds to ask: Will between-family associations replicate in within-family comparisons?\nWith longitudinal data from >3,000 Finnish twins, we associated drinking problems at age 18\u00bd with 13 outcomes assessed at age 25; included were sustained substance abuse, poor health, physical symptoms, early coital debut, multiple sexual partners, life dissatisfaction, truncated education, and financial problems. We assessed associations among twins as individuals with linear regression adjusted for correlated observations; within-family analyses of discordant twin pairs followed, comparing paired means for adult outcomes among co-twins discordant for adolescent problem drinking. Defining discordance by extreme scores on self-reported problem drinking at age 18\u00bd permitted parallel analyses of twins as individuals and discordant twin pairs. Alternate definitions of pair-wise discordance and difference score correlations across the entire twin sample yielded supplementary analyses.\nAll individual associations were highly significant for all definitions of discordance we employed. Depending on definitions of discordance, 11 to 13 comparisons of all drinking-discordant twin pairs and 3 to 6 comparisons of discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs replicated between-family associations. For most outcomes, effect size attenuated from individual-level analysis to that within discordant MZ twin pairs providing evidence of partial confounding in associations reported in earlier research. The exception was the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ); at age 25, GHQ-12 had equivalent associations with age 18\u00bd Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index across all comparisons.\nOur analyses control for shared family background, and, partly or fully, for shared genes, to yield within-family replications and more compelling evidence than previously available that adolescent alcohol abuse disrupts transitions into early adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from loss-of-function mutations in the UBR1 gene. JBS can be easily recognized by its unique clinical presentation (including exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, hypoplasia/aplasia of the alae nasi, congenital scalp defects, sensorineural hearing loss, growth retardation, psychomotor retardation, and anal and genitourinary anomalies). The objective of this study is to report on the first familial case of gender-discordant twins presenting JBS and a novel mutation in the UBR1 gene. We also review literature describing molecularly confirmed cases of JBS. The female twin developed refractory severe diarrhea after the second month of life and died at the age of 3 months. The male twin also developed diarrhea and failure to thrive after the 3 month of life but improved when nutrition support and pancreatic enzyme replacement was started, and he has survived into adolescence. Both patients presented typical clinical features of JBS. A homozygous nonsense mutation (c.3682C>T; p.Q1228X) in UBR1 was confirmed. Severe presentation of JBS usually involves deleterious (nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site) mutations in the UBR1 gene that are thought to completely abolish the expression of a functional protein product, as in this familial case; however, milder presentation of JBS has occasionally been observed with missense mutations in at least 1 of the 2 copies of UBR1, in which there may be residual activity of the product of this gene. Early diagnosis and adequate treatment are crucial for a favorable outcome.",
