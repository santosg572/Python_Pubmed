    "abstract": "Conjoined twins represent one of the rarest forms of congenital abnormalities. We present a case of conjoined twins delivered at born in the Yaounde Gynaeco-Obstetric and Pediatric Hospital in Cameroon. They were joined at the chest and abdomen, and had one functional heart. The outcome was fatal on the seventh day of life, despite appropriate reanimation measures. This case highlights the difficulties inherent in the diagnosis and management of conjoined twins in low resource settings.",

This is an extra challenging surgery because we the anaesthesiologists need to care for two patients at the same time instead of just one. Anaesthesia for conjoined twins 'separation surgery mainly centered on the following concerns: 1.Conjoined Twins' physiology like crossed circulation, distribution of blood volume and organ sharing with their anaesthetic implications. 2.Long marathon surgery with massive fluid shifts and loss of blood & blood components and their rapid replenishment. 3.Meticulous planning for organized management of long hours of anaesthetic administration in two paediatric subjects simultaneously with multi surgical specialties' involvement and their unique requirements.

The approach is on the basis of combined use of ultrasound and endoscopy and minimally invasive access into the womb. Operative fetoscopy is associated with significantly less risk of preterm birth, neonatal morbidity, and maternal morbidity as compared with open fetal surgery. A wide variety of fetal conditions have been surgically managed via operative fetoscopy, particularly complicated monochorionic twin gestations. The aim of this chapter is to review the current status and future direction of operative fetoscopy for the treatment of complicated monochorionic twin pregnancies.",

Details regarding the technique of separation and the procedures required to ensure normal defecation and micturition and normal musculoskeletal function have been described by us in earlier communications. In this paper we describe their present status and ability to face the world as independent adult females. The outcome reflects the responsibilities and dedication of pediatric surgeons for infant patients with congenital problems after they have become adults, taking a pivotal role to involve surgeons of other disciplines as and when necessary.",

    "abstract": "We report an interesting case of a free peritoneal cyst in a woman pregnant with twins. As far as we know, a cyst with histologic properties similar to the metaplastic stratified squamous epithelium of the amnion has not been reported. A 20-year-old Japanese woman pregnant with twins underwent cesarean section at 29 weeks of gestation. A simple serous cyst 5 cm in diameter was found at excavatio vesicouterina. The cyst was not attached to the surrounding organs, and was located independent of any other tissues in the patient's abdominal cavity. Histologic examination revealed that the cyst wall was composed of three major layers (epithelium, mesenchyme and mesothelium) with no vessels. Immunohistochemical staining with human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), cytokeratins, vimentin, placental alkaline phosphatase (PAP) and cluster of differentiation (CD) 31, showed that the cyst wall had characteristic features of the amniotic membrane. Alleles of the patient's husband were not identified when the cyst was genotyped. Some of the patient's loci were deleted and others showed a structurally heterogeneous pattern. These findings suggest that the cyst was derived not from the ovum parthenogenesis, but from the patient's somatic cells and could have been incubated by ascites.",

    "abstract": "Monoamniotic twin pregnancies are necessarily monochorionic and are defined by the development of two fetuses in a single amniotic cavity. This pregnancy is the result of a division of the egg between the 8th and 13th day after fertilization. The diagnosis can and should be performed during the first trimester of pregnancy. Apart from the small risk of fetal transfusion syndrome, the specificities of these pregnancies are linked to greater risk of perinatal mortality, malformations, prematurity and the persistent risk of entanglement cords until birth. Intensified obstetrical monitoring eventually requiring hospitalization followed by a premature birth around 34 SA is recommended to improve perinatal outcomes with a reduction in prenatal mortality. Reorientation toward a neonatal Level III, the proposal of a systematic course of corticosteroids and elective delivery once lung maturation is achieved are recommended. There is not enough argument to recommend specific delivery mode, although cesarean section is performed by most authors to reduce the funicular risks.",

    "abstract": "Genetically informative samples can address hereditary and experiential influences on suicide-related behaviors. The frequency of suicide-related behaviors was compared in twins from two survivor groups: (1) those whose co-twins' deaths were suicides (monozygotic [MZ]: n = 47; dizygotic [DZ]: n = 31), and (2) those whose co-twins' deaths were nonsuicides (MZ: n = 347; DZ: n = 170). The frequency of suicide attempts among suicide survivors was significantly higher in MZ than DZ twins, while the frequency of suicide attempts among nonsuicide twin survivors did not differ between MZ and DZ twins. Twin concordance for suicide attempts more likely reflects a genetic predisposition than a behavioral reaction to the loss.",

    "abstract": "Twins provide a unique capacity to explore relative genetic and environmental contributions to brain development, but results are applicable to non-twin populations only to the extent that twin and singleton brains are alike. A reason to suspect differences is that as a group twins are more likely than singletons to experience adverse prenatal and perinatal events that may affect brain development. We sought to assess whether this increased risk leads to differences in child or adolescent brain anatomy in twins who do not experience behavioral or neurological sequelae during the perinatal period. Brain MRI scans of 185 healthy pediatric twins (mean age = 11.0, SD = 3.6) were compared to scans of 167 age- and sex-matched unrelated singletons on brain structures measured, which included gray and white matter lobar volumes, ventricular volume, and area of the corpus callosum. There were no significant differences between groups for any structure, despite sufficient power for low type II (i.e. false negative) error. The implications of these results are twofold: (1) within this age range and for these measures, it is appropriate to include healthy twins in studies of typical brain development, and (2) findings regarding heritability of brain structures obtained from twin studies can be generalized to non-twin populations.",

This study aims to provide data on expenses of twin deliveries and to compare expenditures of deliveries after spontaneous conception with deliveries after infertility treatment.\nRetrospective cohort-analysis on obstetrical data of twin deliveries at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Luebeck between January 2000 and December 2008.

In our setting fetal outcome (weeks of gestation, birthweight, APGAR, umbilical arterial pH, admission to neonatal intensive care unit etc.) and other maternal data (maternal height, maternal weight, length of surgery etc.) were not significantly different. The prolonged time spent in hospital leads to a 250 Euro higher expense per patient.\nAdditional expenses of twin deliveries after assisted reproduction are due to a longer stay at the hospital. This prolonged stay of an average of 1.1 days was not obvious to medical reasons. Main delivery expenses for the substantial outcome-parameters are not significantly different between both groups.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twins share a single placenta with inter-twin vascular anastomoses, allowing the transfer of blood from one fetus to the other and vice versa. These anastomoses are the essential anatomical substrate for the development of severe complications, including twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and twin-anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS). TTTS and TAPS are both chronic forms of feto-fetal transfusion. TTTS is characterized by the twin oligo-polyhydramnios sequence (TOPS), whereas TAPS is characterized by large inter-twin hemoglobin differences in the absence of amniotic fluid discordances. TAPS may occur spontaneously in a minority of monochorionic twins or in TTTS cases after laser treatment. This review focuses on the differences between TAPS and TTTS in terms of pathogenesis, incidence, diagnostic criteria, treatment modalities, perinatal outcome and long-term outcome.",

The diagnosis of BTD was established by perusal of medical records from the last twenty years. The diagnosis of migraine was based on iterated questionnaires and personal interviews.\nThe odds ratio (OR) of BTD among OCTO-Twin subjects suffering from migraine was 3.5 (1.9-6.7) in monozygotic pairs and 1.7 (1.0-2.9) in dizygotic pairs The corresponding figures among the GENDER unlike-sex DZ-pairs was 2.7 (1.6-4.5). Migraine was associated with female sex and waist circumference.\nThere is a relationship between the occurrence of migraine and BTD, also when controlling for the fact that both disorders are more frequent in women.

Second, twin and sibling data were compared with population standards. In addition to height, weight, and BMI, data on body proportions at age 18 years were analyzed.\nAt the age of 18 years, twins were as tall as their siblings but were significantly leaner. Compared with children from the general population, adolescent twins attained the same height and BMI. Birth weight was shown to have a considerable effect on height in adolescent twins.\nTwins attained normal final height compared with siblings and children from the general population. No differences in BMI were shown between 18-year-old twins and children from the general population, whereas the siblings of twins had increased BMI values compared with the general population.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral genetic studies of speech fluency have focused on participants who present with clinical stuttering. Knowledge about genetic influences on the development and regulation of normal speech fluency is limited. The primary aims of this study were to identify the heritability of stuttering and high nonfluency and to assess the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the correlation between these 2 fluency phenotypes.\nInformation on 6 specific speech fluency behaviors was obtained by maternal report for over 10,500 5-year-old Dutch twin pairs.\nGenetic analyses revealed that both fluency phenotypes were moderately heritable, with heritability estimates of 42% and 45% for probable stuttering and high nonfluency, respectively. Shared environmental factors were also significant, explaining 44% of the individual differences in probable stuttering and 32% in nonfluency. For both phenotypes, the magnitude of the genetic and environmental influences did not differ between boys and girls. The overlap between the 2 traits was substantial (tetrachoric correlation was .72). A bivariate genetic analysis showed that this overlap was due to both overlapping genetic and environmental influences.\nThese findings provide a foundation to justify further studies in normal fluency control, a scientific area that has received little cross-disciplinary attention.",

The survey was completed on a voluntary basis by sets of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins.

Factors found to predict higher photodamage include history of skin cancer (P < .001), zygosity status (MZ vs DZ) (P = .001), weight (P = .02), and cigarette smoking (P = .046). Alcohol consumption was significantly associated with lower photodamage scores (P = .003).\nThe study of twins provides a unique opportunity to control for genetic susceptibility in order to elucidate environmental influences on skin aging.

We present a case of pseudo-monoamniotic twins derived from an MD twin gestation, which was suspected by ultrasound and was confirmed by antepartum fetoscopy. A 28-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1 at 24 weeks of gestation was referred because of suspected polyhydroamnios in an MD twin. Ultrasound suggested twin-twin transfusion syndrome stage III, spontaneous rupture of the dividing membranes and cord entanglement. Fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (FLP) was performed using the Nd:YAG laser on 12 placental vascular connections. Fetoscopy revealed the spontaneous rupture of the dividing membrane and cord entanglement. The remainder of the pregnancy was managed as a monoamniotic twin gestation. Elective cesarean section was performed at 32 weeks of gestation following antenatal steroids and concordantly grown healthy male infants were delivered.",

    "abstract": "Meningiomas in identical twins are extremely rare. To our knowledge, only one previous report of meningiomas in identical twins has been published. We present identical twin sisters with meningiomas. The tumors were located at a similar, but not a common, position (the cerebellopontine angle) in both twins. Histologically, both tumors were diagnosed as meningothelial meningiomas with an angiomatous component. Immunohistochemically, the Ki-67 indices in the two cases were 1.0 and 1.1, and the p53 positive rates were 0.2 and 0.9. The specimens in both cases were reactive to neurofibromin 2 (NF2). A comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) assay revealed an aberration in the long arm of chromosome X, but no aberrations in the long arm of chromosome 22 in either case. These results strongly suggest that genetic aberrations other than NF2 are associated with tumorigenesis in some types of sporadic meningiomas.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in gray matter volume (GMV) are a robust feature of schizophrenia. However, it is not clear to what extent these abnormalities are correlates of the genetic liability to the disorder, as opposed to environmental factors and the disorder itself. We investigated the influence of genetic and environmental risk on GMV in monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs concordant and discordant for schizophrenia.\nTotal and regional GMVs were measured from magnetic resonance images of 80 twins: 14 MZ pairs concordant for schizophrenia, 9 pairs discordant for schizophrenia, and 17 healthy MZ twin pairs.\nTotal GMV was smaller in twins with schizophrenia (t = -3.17, p = .003) and nonpsychotic cotwins from discordant pairs (t = -2.66, p = .011) than in healthy control twins. Twin pairs concordant for schizophrenia displayed reduced regional GMV in the inferior frontal, medial frontal, and anterior cingulate gyri; the caudate; lingual gyrus; and cerebellum relative to healthy twins (p < .05, corrected). Within discordant pairs, twins with schizophrenia had less GMV than their nonpsychotic cotwins in the insula; superior/medial frontal, pre/postcentral, cingulate, and superior temporal gyri; and the paracentral lobule. There were no significant differences in regional GMV between nonpsychotic cotwins and healthy control subjects.\nThe presence of schizophrenia was specifically related to reduced GMV in frontal, insular, cingulate, medial parietal, and temporal cortex, over and above effects of genetic risk for the disorder. These changes could be related to the pathophysiology of the disorder itself or to unique environmental factors acting etiologically or because of the illness.",

    "abstract": "Co-bedding, a developmental care strategy, is the practice of caring for diaper clad twins in one incubator (versus separating and caring for each infant in separate incubators), thus creating the opportunity for skin-to-skin contact and touch between the twins. In studies of mothers and their infants, maternal skin-to-skin contact has been shown to decrease procedural pain response according to both behavioral and physiological indicators in very preterm neonates. It is uncertain if this comfort is derived solely from maternal presence or from stabilization of regulatory processes from direct skin contact. The intent of this study is to compare the comfort effect of co-bedding (between twin infants who are co-bedding and those who are not) on infant pain response and physiologic stability during a tissue breaking procedure (heelstick).\nMedically stable preterm twin infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit will be randomly assigned to a co-bedding group or a standard care group. Pain response will be measured by physiological and videotaped facial reaction using the Premature Infant Pain Profile scale (PIPP). Recovery from the tissue breaking procedure will be determined by the length of time for heart rate and oxygen saturation to return to baseline. Sixty four sets of twins (n = 128) will be recruited into the study. Analysis and inference will be based on the intention-to-treat principle.\nIf twin contact while co-bedding is determined to have a comforting effect for painful procedures, then changes in current neonatal care practices to include co-bedding may be an inexpensive, non invasive method to help maintain physiologic stability and decrease the long term psychological impact of procedural pain in this high risk population. Knowledge obtained from this study will also add to existing theoretical models with respect to the exact mechanism of comfort through touch.\nNCT00917631.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins pose a serious challenge to medical ethics because of the fact that most legally informed ethicists recognise the need to respect the sanctity of life principle for all children. This principle is not negated by impairments to a child nor by the fact that two children's fates may be so closely intertwined that what one does to one inevitably affects the other. Various mitigating factors enter clinical decisions such as the best interests of the child but these can appear rather strained in some of the more debated conjoined twins cases. We therefore need to evaluate the ethics of treatment for conjoined twins quite carefully so that significant ethical values and legal principles are not compromised or distorted beyond credibility. The idea of a potentiality principle that is close to but distinct from the substantial benefit principle as it is used in adult clinical decisions is mooted as one valuable tool in this area.",

    "abstract": "To examine the relationship between birth weight and risk of asthma in a population of twins.\nBirth weight of all live twins (8280 pairs) born in Denmark between 1994 and 2000 was linked to information on asthma obtained from parent-completed questionnaires at age 3-9 years. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the risk of asthma.\nSubjects with a history of asthma at age 3-9 years weighed on average 122 g (95% CI 85 to 160) less at birth than subjects who had not developed asthma, p<0.001. There was a linear increase in asthma risk with decreasing birth weight, OR (per 100 g) 1.04 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.05), p<0.001. Within twin pairs, the lower birthweight twin had a significantly increased risk of asthma compared with the heavier co-twin (11.3% vs 9.9%), OR 1.30 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.54), p=0.002. The result remained significant after adjusting for sex, birth length and Apgar score, OR 1.31 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.65), p=0.027. The risk tended to be higher in monozygotic co-twins compared with dizygotic co-twins, especially for high birth weight differences.\nLow birth weight is a risk factor for asthma independently of gestational age, sex, birth length and Apgar score, but this may be due, in part, to residual non-genetic confounding factors. This finding lends support to the \"fetal origins hypothesis\" suggesting undisclosed prenatal determinants for the risk of asthma.",

    "abstract": "Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are both predictors of coronary artery disease and correlate with each other. We examined whether these 2 phenotypes share a common genetic substrate and investigated the relations of the CRP gene polymorphisms with both CRP levels and HRV indexes. We examined 236 male twins free of symptomatic coronary artery disease, with a mean age +/- SD of 54 +/- 2.9 years. The plasma CRP levels were measured and the frequency domain measures of HRV were assessed using a 24-hour electrocardiographic recording, including ultra-low-, very-low-, low-, and high-frequency power. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CRP gene were genotyped. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between CRP and HRV, as well as the genotype-phenotype association. Bivariate structural equation modeling was performed to estimate the genetic and environmental correlations between CRP and HRV and the explanatory effect of CRP gene polymorphisms on the CRP-HRV association. Both CRP (h(2) = 0.76) and HRV indexes (h(2) = 0.56 to 0.64) showed high heritability. Greater CRP levels were significantly associated with lower HRV. A robust genetic correlation was found between CRP and ultra-low-frequency power (r(G) = -0.3, p = 0.001). One CRP single nucleotide polymorphism (rs1205) was significantly associated with both CRP (p = 0.003) and ultra-low-frequency power (p = 0.005) and explained 11% of the genetic covariance between them. In conclusion, reduced HRV correlates significantly with increased CRP plasma levels and this correlation is due, in large part, to common genetic influences. A polymorphism in the CRP gene contributes to both CRP levels and HRV.",

Fetal heart rate tracings showed tachycardia in the donor twin in the first case, while they showed reassuring patterns in both twins in the second case. Conclusion. These differences in changes of fetal heart rate in the donor twins following acute twin-twin transfusion may be resulted from the differences in amount of transfusion and elapsed time.",

The question of whether these individuals meet scientific criteria for being twins is considered, as is the issue of whether their parents are really parents of twins. Next, the International Society for Twin Studies acknowledges the life and work of its late esteemed colleague, Dr Robert Derom. His professional accomplishments on behalf of twins and twin research will be remembered, as will his helpfulness and generosity to fellow investigators. This tribute to Dr Derom is followed by reviews of new research on the pathophysiology of the twin transfusion syndrome and the use of discordant MZ twins (co-twin control) in behavioral research. The final section provides a review of the athletic talents of two sets of MZ twin tennis players, and the creative skills of a set of MZ twin designers.",

    "abstract": "The purpose was to compare the sella turcica morphology of individuals within pairs of monozygotic twins with normal karyotype and to analyze the similarity between the observed morphology and the morphology of non-twins at the same age with normal karyotype. Profile radiographs from 84 individuals of 42 twin pairs (18 male and 24 female pairs, aged 18-23 years) comprised the material. Sella turcica measurements from non-twins aged 6-21 years were used as normal reference. Length, depth and diameter of the sella turcica were measured and controlled by re-measurements. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for comparison of individuals within twin pairs. For comparison of twins and non-twins, normal standard values for length, depth and diameter were subtracted from the twin values. For the mean values of these differences, confidence limits p values and t values were calculated. The study showed that the size of the sella turcica may be partly similar and partly dissimilar within the pair of monozygotic twins. Statistical evaluation of the data showed correlations between length, depth and diameter of the sella turcica between the two twin individuals in the same twin pair. Differences in sizes are observed between individuals in the twin material and individuals in the non-twin material. As a conclusion, the twin males were more similar within the twin pair, but deviated more from the non-twin material than the females. Female twins had more discrepancy within the twin pair, but deviated less from the non-twin material than the males.",

    "abstract": "The Older Australian Twins Study (OATS) was recently initiated to investigate genetic and environmental factors and their associations and interactions in healthy brain ageing and ageing-related neurocognitive disorders. The study extends the classic MZ-DZ design to include one or two equivalently aged siblings for each twin pair and utilizes the rich resources of the Australian Twin Registry. The study has a number of distinguishing features including comprehensive psychiatric, neuropsychological, cardiovascular, metabolic, and neuroimaging assessments, a longitudinal design and links with a brain donor program. The study measures many behavioral and environmental factors, but in particular lifetime physical and mental activity, physical and psychological trauma, loss of parent early in life, later losses and life events, early-life socioeconomic environment, alcohol and drug use, occupational exposure, and nutrition. It also includes comprehensive cardiovascular assessment, blood biochemistry, genetics and proteomics. The socio-demographic and health data on the first 172 pairs of twins participating in this study are presented. Prevalence of mild cognitive impairment is 12.8% and of dementia 1.5% in the sample. The target sample size is 1000, with at least 400 pairs of twins aged 65-90 years. The cohort will be assessed every two years, with in-depth assessments being repeated. OATS offers an excellent opportunity for collaboration with other similar studies as well as researchers who share the same interests.",

    "abstract": "Although genetic basis of childhood temperament has been well documented in western populations, little is known about whether genes play an important role in childhood temperament in East Asians. The present study examined mother's ratings of Emotionality, Activity, and Sociability (EAS) in 894 pairs of 2- to 9-year-old South Korean twins. The best-fitting model indicated that 34 to 47% of the variances of the EAS were attributable to genetic factors, with the remaining variances being due to the effects of environmental experiences unique to each child. Common family environmental factors were negligible. Genetic variances for Activity and Sociability were primarily nonadditive, whereas those for Emotionality were additive. In spite of well known cultural differences in child rearing practices, social values, and the mean levels of temperament between East Asian and western populations, the pattern of additive vs. nonadditive gene actions and heritability estimates found in the present sample were remarkably similar to those reported in western twin samples. There were no significant age or sex differences in genetic or environmental influences. Overall, these results corroborate cross cultural generality of genetic influences on childhood temperament.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that certain health behaviours, such as smoking, may operate as mediators of the well-established inverse association between IQ and mortality risk. Previous research may be afflicted by unadjusted confounding by socioeconomic or psychosocial factors. Twin designs offer a unique possibility to take genetic and shared environmental factors into account. The aim of the present national twin study was to determine the interrelations between IQ at age 18, childhood and attained social factors and smoking status in young adulthood and mid-life. We studied the association between IQ at age 18 and smoking in later life in a population of 11 589 male Swedish twins. IQ was measured at military conscription, and data on smoking and zygosity was obtained from the Swedish Twin Register. Information on social factors was extracted from censuses. Data on smoking was self-reported by the twins at the age of 22-47 years. Logistic regression models estimated with generalised estimating equations were used to explore possible associations between IQ and smoking among the twins as individuals as well as between-and within twin-pairs. A strong inverse association between IQ and smoking status emerged in unmatched analyses over the entire range of IQ distribution. In within-pair and between-pair analyses it transpired that shared environmental factors explained most of the inverse IQ-smoking relationship. In addition, these analyses indicated that non-shared and genetic factors contributed only slightly (and non-significantly) to the IQ-smoking association. Analysis of twin pairs discordant for IQ and smoking status displayed no evidence that non-shared factors contribute substantially to the association. The question of which shared environmental factors might explain the IQ-smoking association is an intriguing one for future research.",

    "abstract": "A new mechanism modus of micro ultrasonic electroremoval (MUERM) using a precise nanostructure reclamation and a design twins-oval tool offering faster performance in removing the Indium-tin-oxide (In2O3SnO2) thin-films from the surface of the optical PET-diaphragm (PET) of digital paper is demonstrated. Through the ultra-precise etching of the nanostructure, the semiconductor industry can effectively reclaim defective products, thereby reducing production costs. For the removal-process, a faster feed rate of the PET combined with a higher electric current produces a faster removal rate. Using ultrasonic energy transmitted into the electrolyte to assist in the chemical reaction can improve the effect of dreg discharge and contributes to the achievement of a fast PET feed rate. The average removal effect of the ultrasonics is better than the pulsed current while the current rating needs not to be prolonged. The high rotational speed of the twins-oval tool increases the dreg discharge mobility and improves the removal effect. A small height of the anode and the cathode, or a large width of the cathode corresponds to a higher removal rate for the In2O3SnO2. A small arc edge radius of the anode and the cathode also corresponds to a higher removal rate for the In2O3SnO2.",

It is not clear whether LTRA is a causative factor in the development of vasculitis. We present the case of a 26-year-old patient, who developed severe central and peripheral neuropathy after a short-term treatment with LTRA, followed by gastrointestinal perforation and bleeding. The patient was successfully treated with high-dose glucocorticoids, immunoglobulins, and cyclophosphamide. His monozygotic twin brother treated for asthma does not meet classification criteria for Churg-Strauss syndrome at the moment, but his condition is being monitored. Both asthma and rheumatology specialists should consider the possibility of CSS development in patients treated with LTRAs.",

The rate of fetal death was derived for two-week periods starting at 24 weeks' gestation and the prospective risk of fetal death was calculated by determining the number of intrauterine fetal deaths that occurred within the two-week block divided by the number of continuing uncomplicated monochorionic twin pregnancies during that same time period.\nThe unexpected single intrauterine deaths rate was 2.7% versus 2.8% in previously uncomplicated monochorionic and dichorionic diamniotic pregnancies, respectively. The prospective risk of unexpected stillbirth after 32 weeks of gestation was 1.3% for monochorionic and 0.8% for dichorionic pregnancies.\nIn otherwise apparently uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies this prospective risk of fetal death after 32 weeks of gestation is lower than reported and similar to that of dichorionic pregnancies, so does not sustain the theory of elective preterm delivery.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides anatomical connectivity information by examining the directional organization of white matter microstructure. Anatomical connectivity and its abnormalities may be heritable traits associated with schizophrenia. To further examine this hypothesis, two studies were conducted to compare anatomical connectivity between (a) monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and random pairings among twins and (b) first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients and a healthy control group. Analyses focused on frontal regions of the brain following previous findings of anatomical connectivity abnormalities associated with schizophrenia. For Study 1, eighteen MZ twin pairs (11 female pairs, age: M = 25.44, SD = 5.69) were recruited. For Study 2, twenty-two first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients (14 females, age: M = 48.50, SD = 8.22), and 30 healthy controls (12 females, age: M = 43.83, SD = 11.39) were recruited. Fractional anisotropy (FA), a white matter directional organization metric, was measured with DTI. In Study 1, FA values were more strongly correlated between MZ twin pairs than between randomly generated pairs in genu of corpus callosum, anterior cingulum and forceps minor. In Study 2, relatives of schizophrenia patients showed reduced FA values in medial frontal white matter (p < 0.05, corrected). The present study suggested that anatomical connectivity in medial prefrontal cortex appeared significantly heritable within MZ twin pairs, an important criterion in the development of an endophenotype. In addition, altered medial frontal white matter integrity found in non-affected relatives of schizophrenia patients seems to suggest that reduced white matter integrity in medial frontal regions of the brain might be associated with the genetic liability to schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Educational opportunities for African-Americans expanded throughout the 20(th) century. Twin pairs are an informative population in which to examine changes in educational attainment because each twin has the same parents and childhood socioeconomic status. We hypothesized that correlation in educational attainment of older twin pairs would be higher compared to younger twin pairs reflecting changes in educational access over time and potentially reflecting a \"ceiling effect\" associated with Jim Crow laws and discrimination.\nWe used data from 211 same-sex twin pairs (98 identical, 113 fraternal) in the Carolina African-American Twin Study of Aging who were identified through birth records. Participants completed an in-person interview. The twins were predominantly female (61%), with a mean age of 50 years (SD = 0.5). We found that older age groups had a stronger intra-twin correlation of attained educational level. Further analysis across strata revealed a trend across zygosity, with identical twins demonstrating more similar educational attainment levels than did their fraternal twin counterparts, suggesting a genetic influence.\nThese findings suggest that as educational opportunities broadened in the 20th century, African-Americans gained access to educational opportunities that better matched their individual abilities.",

The conjoined fetuses were diagnosed as thoracopagus twins with a single beating heart shared between the thoraxes. Extensive ultrasound examination suggested an extremely poor prognosis, Therapeutic termination was performed at 11 weeks.\nGiven that single embryo transfers are able to shed light on the real incidence of conjoined twins developed on day 2/3 or on day 5/6, this is of interest mechanistically. Thus, it should be taken into account when trying to determine the true incidence of conjoined twins and ultimately trying to understand why these anomalies occur.

    "abstract": "Several studies suggest a link between increased activity of the inflammatory inhibitor-kappaB kinase/nuclear factor-kappaB (IKK/NF-kappaB) pathway in skeletal muscle and insulin resistance.\nWe aimed to study the regulation of skeletal muscle IKK/NF-kappaB pathway activity as well as the association with glucose metabolism and skeletal muscle insulin signaling.\nThe study population included a metabolically well-characterized cohort of young and elderly predominantly nondiabetic twins (n = 181). Inhibitor-kappaBbeta (IkappaBbeta) protein levels are negatively associated with IKK/NF-kappaB pathway activity and were used to evaluate pathway activity with p65 levels included as loading control. This indirect measure for IKK/NF-kappaB pathway activity was validated by a p65 binding assay.\nEvaluating the effects of heritability, age, sex, obesity, aerobic capacity, and several hormonal factors (eg insulin and TNF-alpha), only sex and age were significant predictors of IkappaBbeta to p65 ratio (28% decreased ratio in the elderly, P < 0.01, and 49% increased in males P < 0.01). IkappaBbeta to p65 ratio was unrelated to peripheral insulin sensitivity (P = 0.51) and in accordance with this also unrelated to proximal insulin signaling (P = 0.81). Although no association was seen with plasma glucose after oral glucose challenge, there was a tendency for lower IkappaBbeta to p65 ratio (adjusted for age and sex) in subjects with impaired as opposed to normal glucose tolerance (P = 0.055).\nAltogether the subtle elevated IKK/NF-kappaB pathway activity seen in glucose-intolerant subjects suggests that IKK/NF-kappaB pathway activation may be secondary to impaired glucose tolerance and that skeletal muscle IKK/NF-kappaB pathway activity is unlikely to play any major role in the control of skeletal muscle insulin action in nondiabetic subjects.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the prognosis of monochorionic twins with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR), classified according to the type of umbilical artery Doppler, under expectant management.\nThe outcome of 81 cases with isolated sIUGR was evaluated according to a classification based on umbilical artery (UA) Doppler diastolic flow in the IUGR twin (I: present, II: constantly absent/reverse, III: intermittently absent/reverse). Selective feticide was not considered due to legal constraints. Perinatal outcomes included perinatal death and neurological outcome at 6 months of age.\nFrom 81 cases with the diagnosis of sIUGR, twin-twin transfusion was diagnosed in 18 cases. This left 63 cases, of which 23 were classified as type I (36.5%), 27 as type II (42.9%) and 13 as type III (20.6%). Intrauterine death occurred in 4.3% (1), 29.6% (8) and 15.4% (2) among IUGR twins, and 4.3% (1), 22.2% (6) and 0.0% (0) among larger twins. Neonatal death occurred in 0.0% (0), 18.5% (5) and 0.0% (0) among IUGR twins, and 0.0% (0), 11.1% (3) and 23.0% (3) among larger twins. Neurological abnormalities at 6 months were found in 4.3% (1), 14.8% (4) and 23.1% (3) in smaller twins and 0.0% (0), 11.1% (3) and 38.5% (5) in larger twins, respectively. Intact survival at 6 months was recorded in 91% (21), 37% (10) and 61% (8) in smaller twins and 95% (22), 55% (15) and 38% (5) in larger twins, respectively.\nThe outcome in monochorionic twins with sIUGR and abnormal umbilical artery Doppler is poor under expectant management. Normal Doppler seems to be associated with a good prognosis.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that patients with schizophrenia and some of their relatives suffer from reduced neurocognitive efficiency, increasing their sensitivity to experimental task demands. The present study evaluated such a possibility during performance of a working memory task by schizophrenia patients and their co-twins along with a healthy control sample. Electrophysiological data were obtained from sets of nine twin pairs (monozygotic and dizygotic pairs collapsed) discordant for a diagnosis of schizophrenia and from nine matched healthy control twin pairs, during administration of a variable-load spatial working memory task. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured immediately after memory set onset and during a delay period. For correctly performed trials, slow-wave ERP activity measured during the late stimulus encoding and delay periods exhibited a significant Diagnostic Group-by-Memory Load interaction, with schizophrenia patients showing a differentially strong load effect. Patients' co-twins displayed an intermediate level of load sensitivity while healthy controls showed no significant load effect. These results support an inefficiency model of neurocognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia, a pattern that appears to be related to the pathogenesis and inheritance of the disorder. Furthermore, this inefficiency appeared during the late stimulus encoding stage of working memory functioning, possibly reflecting disruptions in stimulus representation consolidation.",

    "abstract": "Serum concentrations of some hormones are risk factors for certain cancers, but little is known about their familial associations especially for females.\nWe measured serum concentrations of estradiol (E(2)), testosterone (T), SHBG, prolactin, and IGF-I for 645 Australian female postmenopausal twins and their sisters [182 monozygotic (MZ) and 107 dizygotic (DZ) pairs and 67 nontwin sisters] using well-established immunoassays. After suitable transformation and adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), and time since menopause, familial correlations and proportions of variance attributed to genetic (h(2)) and nongenetic factors common to sisterships (c(2)) were estimated under the classic twin multivariate normal model using FISHER.\nFor all serum concentrations except prolactin, MZ, DZ, and sister pairs were correlated (P < 0.001). MZ correlations were in the range 0.5-0.7, and for all serum concentrations, there were no differences between DZ and sister correlations. MZ correlations were greater than DZ and sister correlations for log SHBG (P = 0.0001), IGF-I (P = 0.0002), and square-root T (P = 0.007) but not log E(2) (P = 0.3), and the respective h(2) estimates were 0.56 (SE = 0.14), 0.53 (0.17), 0.39 (0.14), and 0.14 (0.16). For log E(2) and square-root T, c(2) estimates were 0.39 (0.14) and 0.22 (0.12).\nThere are strong familial correlations in postmenopausal SHBG, IGF-I, and to a lesser extent T, which are consistent with a genetic etiology. For E(2), and to a lesser extent T, correlations are consistent with substantial nongenetic familial factors. The latter might include maternal effects.",

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is common but the aetiology is unclear. This study examined the heritability of acute appendicitis.\nThe study included twin pairs with known zygosity born between 1959 and 1985. Individuals with acute appendicitis were found by record linkage with the Swedish Inpatient Register. Comparing monodizygotic and dizygotic twins, the similarity and relative proportions of phenotypic variance resulting from genetic and environmental factors were analysed. Risks of acute appendicitis explained by heritability and environmental effects were estimated.\nSome 3441 monozygotic and 2429 dizygotic twins were identified. Almost no genetic effects were found in males (8 (95 per cent confidence interval 0 to 50) per cent), but shared (31 (0 to 49) per cent) and non-shared (61 (47 to 74) per cent) environmental factors accounted for this risk. In females, the heritability was estimated as 20 (0 to 36) per cent and the remaining variation was due to non-shared environmental factors (80 (64 to 98) per cent). For the sexes combined, genetic effects accounted for 30 (5 to 40) per cent and non-shared environmental effects for 70 (60 to 81) per cent of the risk.\nAcute appendicitis has a complex aetiology with sex differences in heritability and environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Two metaphors are presented to highlight concepts that could lead to a paradigm shift in dental studies of twins. The first, derived from the Song of Solomon in the Bible, refers to teeth as being twins. This viewpoint emphasises that each tooth should be viewed as a paired structure, not only with its antimere (within the same arch) but also with its isomer (in the opposing arch). The other metaphor provided by Waddington in 1957 is visual and involves 'an epigenetic landscape' that represents the processes of decision-making by cells during development. It likens the different stages of cellular decision-making to a ball rolling down an undulating landscape of interconnecting hills and valleys. This viewpoint helps to explain how distinct differences in dental phenotypes may arise both within and between monozygotic (MZ) co-twins due to relatively minor temporospatial effects during development. Measurements of maximum mesiodistal diameters of teeth in a pair of MZ twins, using calipers and also 2D and 3D imaging systems, have demonstrated that differences in dental crown size occur between antimeric pairs and between corresponding teeth of MZ co-twins. By defining new dental phenotypes that provide more comprehensive descriptions of tooth size and shape, and by drawing on the metaphors described, we are confident of providing new insights into the reasons for observed similarities and differences within, and between, the dentitions of twins. Our approaches will focus on multivariate analyses that take into account the paired arrangement of teeth and also explore epigenetic, as well as genetic and environmental, sources of variation.",

    "abstract": "This study is part of a larger investigation of genetic and environmental influences on primary tooth emergence in Australian twins. Our aims were to describe patterns of emergence asymmetry, including directional and fluctuating components (DA, FA), and to test for a genetic basis to observed asymmetry.\nThe study sample consisted of 131 twin pairs. Using one randomly-selected twin from each pair, dental asymmetry was examined by analysing the number of days between emergence of antimeres (Delta), with dates of emergence provided through parental recording. Scatterplots were used for assessment of DA and FA, followed by paired t-tests to detect significant differences in mean Delta from zero (evidence of DA). FA was assessed by calculating means and variances of the absolute value of Delta.

    "abstract": "Microchimerism is the presence of small populations of cells from one individual in another genetically distinct individual. This phenomenon can arise from pregnancy, blood transfusion, or bidirectional cell trafficking between twins in utero. Microchimerism has recently been proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of thyroid autoimmunity. In that case, twins from opposite-sex pairs (OS) should have an increased risk of thyroid autoantibodies (TA).\nThe aim of the study was to compare the frequency of TA in twin individuals from OS and monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs.\nThis was a case-control study of 240 individuals (120 females and 120 males) from OS twin pairs (cases) and 568 control individuals from MZ pairs (284 females and 284 males).\nAntibodies toward thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb), thyroglobulin (TgAb), and the TSH receptor (TSHRAb) were measured and considered positive if greater than 60 U/ml, greater than 60 U/ml, and greater than 1.0 U/liter, respectively.\nThe frequency of TPOAb, TgAb, and TSHRAb among female cases was 15.0, 5.0, and 4.2%, respectively, which was higher than the corresponding prevalences in the female control population: 7.4% (P = 0.018), 1.1% (P = 0.023), and 0.7% (P = 0.026), respectively. However, when corrected for the number of phenotypes studied (TPOAb, TgAb, TSHRAb, and any thyroid antibody), the association remained significant only in the combined group, P(corrected) = 0.012. Essentially similar results were obtained in males.\nBoth female and male twins from OS pairs, as opposed to MZ pairs, have an increased frequency of TA, indicating a potential role of microchimerism in developing TA.",

    "abstract": "Heritability may play a role in nonfamilial atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesized that a monozygotic (MZ) twin whose co-twin was diagnosed with AF would have an increased risk of the disease compared with a dizygotic (DZ) twin in the same situation.\nA sample of 1137 same-sex twin pairs (356 MZ and 781 DZ pairs) in which one or both members were diagnosed with AF were identified in The Danish Twin Registry. Concordance rates were twice as high for MZ pairs than for DZ pairs regardless of sex (22.0% versus 11.6%, P<0.0001). In a Cox regression of event-free survival times, we compared the time span between occurrences of disease in MZ and DZ twins. The unaffected twin was included when his or her twin-sibling (the index twin) was diagnosed with AF. After adjustment for age at entry, MZ twins had a significantly shorter event-free survival time (hazard ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.0), thereby indicating a genetic component. Using biometric models, we estimated the heritability of AF to be 62% (55% to 68%), due to additive genetics. There were no significant differences across sexes.\nAll the analyses of twin similarities in the present study indicate that genetic factors play a substantial role in the risk of AF for both sexes. The recurrence risk for co-twins (12% to 22%) is clinically relevant and suggests that co-twins of AF-affected twins belong to a high-risk group for AF.",

    "abstract": "Loss of a twin has been largely overlooked by bereavement counselors and clinicians. This particular type of loss is also poorly understood among the public. Consequently, some bereaved twins have established a unique organization, Twinless Twins Support Group International, for the purpose of sharing this traumatic life experience with one another. The present article reviews events from the annual convention of Twinless Twins, held in July 2009, in Denver, Colorado. Selected findings from research on twin loss are also presented. Next, twin research concerned with the origins and implications of empathy, hormone replacement therapy and multiple birth conception will be reviewed. This article concludes with summaries of real life stories of twins' kidney disease, literary talent and retirement festivities.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies in Asian populations have identified variants in the EDAR and FGFR2 genes that arose following the divergence of Asians and Europeans and are associated with thick straight hair. To date no genetic variants have been identified influencing hair texture in Europeans. In the current study we examined the heritability of hair curliness in three unselected samples of predominantly European ancestry (N(S1) = 2717; N(S2) = 3904; N(S3) = 5079). When rated using a three point scale (Straight/Wavy/Curly) males were approximately 5% more likely to report straight hair than females and there were suggestions in the data that curliness increased slightly with age. Across samples significant additive and dominant genetic influences were detected resulting in a broad sense heritability of 85-95%. Given the magnitude and the specificity of the EDAR effect on hair morphology in Asian populations we are hopeful that future association studies will detect similar genetic influences in European populations.",

    "abstract": "Ahigher frequency of skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is found in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) than in controls. Although goitre is often present in AITD, a recent study failed to show an association between XCI and clinically overt nontoxic goitre. However, the etiology of overt goitre is complex, and the mechanisms influencing thyroid volume may involve fewer factors than the mechanisms underlying overt goitre. In order to examine the impact of XCI on thyroid volume in euthyroid females, we studied whether within cohort (n = 138) and within twin pair (n = 69) differences in XCI are correlated with differences in thyroid volume. XCI was determined by PCR analysis of a polymorphic CAG repeat in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene. Thyroid volume was determined by ultrasound. Neither in the within cohort nor in the within twin pair analysis could we demonstrate a statistically significant association between XCI and thyroid volume: Regression coefficient (beta) = 0.023 (95% confidence interval, -0.062-0.108), p = 0.592 and beta = 0.038 (-0.080-0.156), p = 0.521, respectively. Controlling for potential confounders such as zygosity, age, TSH, smoking habits and use of oral contraceptives did not change the findings. In conclusion, in a sample of euthyroid Danish female twins, we found no evidence of a relationship between XCI pattern and thyroid volume.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypically discordant monozygotic twins offer the possibility of gene discovery through delineation of molecular abnormalities in one member of the twin pair. One proposed mechanism of discordance is postzygotically occurring genomic alterations resulting from mitotic recombination and other somatic changes. Detection of altered genomic fragments can reveal candidate gene loci that can be verified through additional analyses. We investigated this hypothesis using array comparative genomic hybridization; the 50K and 250K Affymetrix GeneChip(R) SNP arrays and an Illumina custom array consisting of 1,536 SNPs, to scan for genomic alterations in a sample of monozygotic twin pairs with discordant cleft lip and/or palate phenotypes. Paired analysis for deletions, amplifications and loss of heterozygosity, along with sequence verification of SNPs with discordant genotype calls did not reveal any genomic discordance between twin pairs in lymphocyte DNA samples. Our results demonstrate that postzygotic genomic alterations are not a common cause of monozygotic twin discordance for isolated cleft lip and/or palate. However, rare or balanced genomic alterations, tissue-specific events and small aberrations beyond the detection level of our experimental approach cannot be ruled out. The stability of genomes we observed in our study samples also suggests that detection of discordant events in other monozygotic twin pairs would be remarkable and of potential disease significance.",

    "abstract": "In this article we report on reading ability of twin children in kindergarten to Grade 2 as a function of whether members of the pairs are assigned to the same or different classrooms. All analyses were run using mixed model regressions to account for the interdependence between twin pairs. The samples, total N = 1505, are from Australia and the United States. We found a close-to-significant difference in favor of same-class children in kindergarten and Grade 1. However, when results were adjusted to take account of pre-existing differences in disruptive behavior and in preliteracy ability, the class assignment effects disappeared. We suggest that these pre-existing differences, particularly disruptive behavior, are influencing decisions about whether to separate twins or not and also affecting early reading performance, a conclusion supported by significant correlations between the behavioral measures, preliteracy, and school-based reading. We conclude that, on average, early literacy in twins is not directly affected by their assignment to the same or different classrooms.",

Unravelling the mechanisms underpinning important blinding diseases could allow preventative or curative steps to be implemented. Twin siblings provide a unique opportunity in biology to discover genes associated with numerous eye diseases and ocular biometry. Twins are particularly useful for quantitative trait analysis through genome-wide association and linkage studies. Although many studies involving twins rely on twin registries, we present our approach to the Twins Eye Study in Tasmania to provide insight into possible recruitment strategies, expected participation rates and potential examination strategies that can be considered by other researchers for similar studies. Five separate avenues for cohort recruitment were adopted: (1) piggy-backing existing studies where twins had been recruited, (2) utilizing the national twin registry, (3) word-of-mouth and local media publicity, (4) directly approaching schools, and finally (5) collaborating with other research groups studying twins.",

Results for internalizing behavior were inconclusive with respect to transmission of risk.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies exploring the heritability of cannabis initiation have been carried out in the United States, Australia and United Kingdom. In the present study we assess cannabis initiation in The Netherlands, where the use of cannabis in small amounts is permitted. The sample included 3115 twins with a mean age of 27.4 years (SD 4.7) who are registered with the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR). Individual differences in cannabis initiation showed moderate genetic influences (44%). The remaining variance was explained by environmental influences shared by twins (31%) and by unique environmental factors (24%). Compared to studies from other countries, these results suggest that the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors is not different in a country with a more liberal cannabis policy.",

    "abstract": "To assess the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to different definitions of spinal pain and consequences of spinal pain.\nThe Danish Twin Registry contains detailed survey information on spinal pain and its consequences in twins ages 20-71 years. A classic genetic epidemiologic analysis was performed in order to establish heritability for a number of phenotypes, including location of pain, radiation of pain in the extremities or chest, pain duration, and combinations of pain in >1 spinal area. Consequences included reduced physical activity, sick leave, care seeking, change of work, and disability pension. The analysis included a biometric analysis based on the effect of shared genetic and common environmental factors. Furthermore, a bivariate twin model was fitted to identify genetic and environmental correlations.\nAltogether, data on 15,328 twin individuals (44% monozygotic and 56% dizygotic) from complete twin pairs were included. Genetic susceptibility explained approximately 38% of lumbar pain, 32% of thoracic pain, and 39% of neck pain. For patterns of pain, estimates were 7% for lumbar/thoracic, 24% for lumbar/cervical, 0% for thoracic/cervical, and 35% for pain in all 3 areas. Moderate to high genetic correlations indicated a common genetic basis for many spinal pain syndromes. In general, heritability was higher for women, and only a minor age effect was seen.\nHeritability estimates for pain in different spinal regions are quite similar and there is a moderate to high genetic correlation between the phenotypes. This may indicate a common genetic basis for a high proportion of spinal pain.",

The heterokaryotype was an incidental finding from an amniocentesis performed for prenatal diagnosis of beta-thalassaemia major in a pair of dichorionic twins. Monozygocity was revealed by QF-PCR showing identical short tandem repeat markers on chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X and Y. The twins were heterokaryotypic for duplication chromosome 2q13-q23.3, as shown by array comparative genomic hybridization. Selective foeticide was performed. This case demonstrates that heterokaryotypic monozygotic dichorionic twins are a genetic possibility that does occur.",

    "abstract": "To present antepartal diagnostic findings including 2D/3D ultrasonography in a rare case of conjoined twins with diamniotic placentation.\nIn ultrasonographic examination, a communicating structure containing solid and cystic components together with cord vessels was found between the fetuses. The long axes of the fetuses were not parallel and they moved independently. Bladder configurations were absent. A fetal membrane from the chorioidal plate was imaged.\nPostmortem pathological examination revealed that the twins were conjoined by way of fused cloacal exstrophy and omphalocele, and the separate amniotic cavities communicated via a fused allantoic cavity. The placenta was monochorionic and diamniotic. DNA analysis of the twins and the placenta confirmed the monozygotic origin.\nVisualization of the amniotic membrane does not rule out conjoined twins in rare cases of monochorionic twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Cytosine-5 methylation within CpG dinucleotides is a potentially important mechanism of epigenetic influence on human traits and disease. In addition to influences of age and gender, genetic control of DNA methylation levels has recently been described. We used whole blood genomic DNA in a twin set (23 MZ twin-pairs and 23 DZ twin-pairs, N = 92) as well as healthy controls (N = 96) to investigate heritability and relationship with age and gender of selected DNA methylation profiles using readily commercially available GoldenGate bead array technology. Despite the inability to detect meaningful methylation differences in the majority of CpG loci due to tissue type and locus selection issues, we found replicable significant associations of DNA methylation with age and gender. We identified associations of genetically heritable single nucleotide polymorphisms with large differences in DNA methylation levels near the polymorphism (cis effects) as well as associations with much smaller differences in DNA methylation levels elsewhere in the human genome (trans effects). Our results demonstrate the feasibility of array-based approaches in studies of DNA methylation and highlight the vast differences between individual loci. The identification of CpG loci of which DNA methylation levels are under genetic control or are related to age or gender will facilitate further studies into the role of DNA methylation and disease.",

    "abstract": "Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia is a disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by extremely low plasma levels of apolipoprotein B as well as low levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. We report the case of impairment of retinal function and diffuse pain in both legs often related to physical activity, as well as the presence of acanthocytosis on peripheral blood smear. Neurophysiological studies suggested dysfunction of the thin myelinated (A) and unmyelinated (C) fibers, in spite of preserved A fiber function, which has not been previously described in this condition. All clinical symptoms and the neurophysiological abnormalities improved after high-dose vitamin E and A supplementation. These findings suggest that this syndrome may have a wide spectrum of manifestations and an early appearance of symptoms in the pediatric age group.",

We investigated T cell reactivity after living related kidney transplantation between two monocygotic twins and in consequence correlated the withdrawal of individual immunosuppressive medication with immunological findings.\nImmunosuppression consisted of mycophenolate mofetil, glucocorticoid single shot, and induction therapy with antithymocyte immunoglobulin.\nFACS analysis of recipient peripheral blood cells revealed a normal haemogram after transplantation, showing non-activated CD4 and CD8 cells. Mixed lymphocyte reaction did not reveal donor-specific T cell activity. IFN-gamma and IL-10 ELISA of supernatants of recipient cells cocultivated with donor cells support the lack of Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation.\nBased on immunological findings on days 5 and 20 MMF-therapy was reduced and stopped.

    "abstract": "Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) carries a significant risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Serial amnioreduction and fetoscopic laser photocoagulation have decreased perinatal mortality, thereby shifting attention towards short-term and long-term morbidity. Most morbidity occurs within the central nervous system. Ischemic lesions, however, such as congenital skin loss and limb necrosis may occur anywhere in the vasculature of recipient twins. Ischemia may also occur during serial amnioreduction and fetoscopic laser photocoagulation. We report a case of ileal perforation in the donor twin of untreated TTTS. Histopathology showed a focal area of erosion, possibly from ischemia. We also discuss the clinical features of ischemic intestinal complications of TTTS and review the literature.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies offer the opportunity to determine the relative contribution of genes versus environment in traits of interest. Here, we investigate the extent to which variance in brain structure is reduced in monozygous twins with identical genetic make-up. We investigate whether using twins as compared to a control population reduces variability in a number of common magnetic resonance (MR) structural measures, and we investigate the location of areas under major genetic influences. This is fundamental to understanding the benefit of using twins in studies where structure is the phenotype of interest. Twenty-three pairs of healthy MZ twins were compared to matched control pairs. Volume, T2 and diffusion MR imaging were performed as well as spectroscopy (MRS). Images were compared using (i) global measures of standard deviation and effect size, (ii) voxel-based analysis of similarity and (iii) intra-pair correlation. Global measures indicated a consistent increase in structural similarity in twins. The voxel-based and correlation analyses indicated a widespread pattern of increased similarity in twin pairs, particularly in frontal and temporal regions. The areas of increased similarity were most widespread for the diffusion trace and least widespread for T2. MRS showed consistent reduction in metabolite variation that was significant in the temporal lobe N-acetylaspartate (NAA). This study has shown the distribution and magnitude of reduced variability in brain volume, diffusion, T2 and metabolites in twins. The data suggest that evaluation of twins discordant for disease is indeed a valid way to attribute genetic or environmental influences to observed abnormalities in patients since evidence is provided for the underlying assumption of decreased variability in twins.",

    "abstract": "This article examines relationships between reproductive onset and lifetime history of smoking, regular smoking, and nicotine dependence, and cannabis and other illicit drug use.\nData were drawn from a young adult cohort of 3,386 female and 2,751 male Australian twins born between 1964 and 1971. Survival analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression models predicting age at first childbirth from history of substance use or disorder separately by substance class. Other substance use or disorder, including alcohol dependence, as well as sociodemographic characteristics, history of psychopathology, and family and childhood risks, were included as control variables in adjusted models.\nRegular smoking and nicotine dependence were associated with earlier reproduction, with pronounced effects for women. For women, use of cannabis was associated with early reproduction before age 20, and with delayed reproduction among women who have not reproduced by age 20 or 25. Adjustment for control variables only partially explained these associations.\nConsistent with research linking adolescent use with sexual risk taking predictive of early childbearing, regular smokers and nicotine-dependent individuals show earlier reproductive onset. In contrast, delays in childbearing associated with use of cannabis are consistent with impairments in reproductive ability and/or opportunities for reproduction. Continued research on risks both upstream and downstream of substance-use initiation and onset of substance-use disorder is needed for causal mechanisms to be fully understood.",

Using 8,791 twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study, we examine genetic stability and change in the etiology of g assessed by diverse measures during the critical transition from early to middle childhood. The heritability of a latent g factor in early childhood is 23%, whereas shared environment accounts for 74% of the variance. In contrast, in middle childhood, heritability of a latent g factor is 62%, and shared environment accounts for 33%. Despite increasing importance of genetic influences and declining influence of shared environment, similar genetic and shared environmental factors affect g from early to middle childhood, as indicated by a cross-age genetic correlation of .57 and a shared environmental correlation of .65. These findings set constraints on how genetic and environmental variation affects the developing brain.",

We utilized a twin model to explore these hypotheses.\nOne hundred pairs of healthy twins aged 8.9 yr (range, 7.2-10.9 yr) had fasting blood samples collected, blood pressure (BP) measured, and anthropometry assessed. All measurements were converted to sd scores (SDS) to adjust for age and sex.\nMean birth weights in both monozygotic and dizygotic twins were -0.90 SDS lower than the UK reference. In postnatal life, 58% of monozygotic twins and 59% of dizygotic twins showed rapid weight gain (a change of more than +0.67 in weight SDS) from birth. Postnatal weight gain was positively associated with sum of skinfolds (r = 0.51; P < 0.0005), fasting insulin levels (r = 0.35; P < 0.0005), systolic BP (r = 0.30; P < 0.0005), and diastolic BP (r = 0.15; P < 0.05) at follow-up. Heritability estimates (additive genetic components) were calculated using variance components models for: birth weight, 44%; postnatal weight gain, 80%; childhood height, 89%; body mass index, 72%; sum of skinfolds, 89%; waist circumference, 74%; fasting insulin, 65%; systolic BP, 33%; and diastolic BP, 29%.\nPostnatal weight gain from birth, rather than birth weight, was associated with childhood risk markers for adult metabolic disease. Childhood weight gain was highly heritable, and genetic factors associated with postnatal weight gain are likely to also contribute to risks for adult disease.",

Besides the usual fcc phase of Ag, the heteronanostructures also contain a rare hcp (4H polytypic) phase, which favors asymmetrical growth. The rod-needle heteronanostructures (RNHSs) and plate-belt heteronanostructures (PBHSs) are formed through two different mechanisms. For RNHSs, the 4H and fcc phases coexist but have different densities in different segments, while for PBHSs, the fcc and 4H crystal structures exist in plate and belt segments, respectively. Condition-sensitive coexisting phase preferences can be applied as a new way of controlling the shape and thus the properties of Ag nanostructures.",

    "abstract": "There is a large group of disorders characterized by non-cranial vascular malformations and a dysregulated growth, of which the prototype may be Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS). The aetiology of KTS and vascular malformations-dysregulated growth (VM-DG) syndromes resembling KTS is obscure, but polygenic paradominant inheritance involving mutations or polymorphisms in two or more genes simultaneously, of which one (or more) are involved in (lymph)angiogenesis and the other(s) in growth regulation has been proposed for KTS and related VM-DG entities. This provides an explanation for the variability of the VM-DG syndromes through the numerous possible combinations of mutated genes involved. We report on three monozygotic female twins who are discordant for a VM-DG syndrome resembling KTS. We suggest that our observation is consistent with the concept of polygenic paradominant inheritance involving two or more genes. We discuss the published observations in twins discordant for other disorders associated with disturbed growth regulation such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Silver-Russell syndrome, and the occurrence in cousins with KTS and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which are best explained by an imprinting disturbance. We propose that, similarly, disturbed imprinting plays a role in the pathogenesis of VM-DG syndromes in general, and suggest the same may hold for KTS in sensu strictu or Proteus syndrome. Further studies to investigate imprinting status in VM-DG syndromes, including KTS and Proteus syndrome, are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic (MC) twins are at increased risk for perinatal mortality and serious morbidity due to the presence of placental vascular anastomoses. Cerebral injury can be secondary to haemodynamic and hematological disorders during pregnancy (especially twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) or intrauterine co-twin death) or from postnatal injury associated with prematurity and low birth weight, common complications in twin pregnancies. We investigated neurodevelopmental outcome in MC and dichorionic (DC) twins at the age of two years.\nThis was a prospective cohort study. Cerebral palsy (CP) was studied in 182 MC infants and 189 DC infants matched for weight and age at delivery, gender, ethnicity of the mother and study center. After losses to follow-up, 282 of the 366 infants without CP were available to be tested with the Griffiths Mental Developmental Scales at 22 months corrected age, all born between January 2005 and January 2006 in nine perinatal centers in The Netherlands. Due to phenotypic (un)alikeness in mono-or dizygosity, the principal investigator was not blinded to chorionic status; perinatal outcome, with exception of co-twin death, was not known to the examiner.\nFour out of 182 MC infants had CP (2.2%) - two of the four CP-cases were due to complications specific to MC twin pregnancies (TTTS and co-twin death) and the other two cases of CP were the result of cystic PVL after preterm birth - compared to one sibling of a DC twin (0.5%; OR 4.2, 95% CI 0.5-38.2) of unknown origin. Follow-up rate of neurodevelopmental outcome by Griffith's test was 76%. The majority of 2-year-old twins had normal developmental status. There were no significant differences between MC and DC twins. One MC infant (0.7%) had a developmental delay compared to 6 DC infants (4.2%; OR 0.2, 95% 0.0-1.4). Birth weight discordancy did not influence long-term outcome, though the smaller twin had slightly lower developmental scores than its larger co-twin.\nThere were no significant differences in occurrence of cerebral palsy as well as neurodevelopmental outcome between MC and DC twins. Outcome of MC twins seems favourable in the absence of TTTS or co-twin death.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the genetic and environmental influences on apolipoproteins have been conducted, but few have used data from Japanese twins. The aim of this study was to quantify and compare the genetic and environmental causes of individual differences in the serum concentrations of apolipoproteins in Japanese middle-aged twins.\nApo A-I, apo A-II, apo B, apo C-II, apo C-III, and apo E were studied. A total of 142 twin pairs, aged 45 through 65 years, were enrolled: 85 monozygotic pairs (59 male, 26 female) and 57 same-sexed dizygotic pairs (43 male, 14 female). The intraclass correlation coefficient and structural equation modeling were used to estimate the best-fitting model and heritability.\nSixteen percent to 75% of the total variances of apo A-I, apo C-II, and apo C-III were attributable to genetic influence; apo A-I and apo C-II were influenced by dominant genetic factors. Twenty percent to 73% of the total variances of apo A-II, apo B, and apo E were attributable to additive genetic influence; apo B was clearly influenced by common environmental factors. Furthermore, the heritability of all apolipoproteins was higher among females than among males.\nGenetic factors, including additive genetic effects (A) and dominant effects (D), influence apolipoprotein levels. However, a common environment does not influence the variances of these apolipoproteins, with the exception of apo B. Furthermore, the heritability of apolipoprotein phenotypes differs by sex.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic, which refers to heritable differences of genes without changing their DNA sequences, is one of the most important biology phenomena in multicellular eukaryotes. Its research contents involves DNA methylation, genomic imprinting, histone acetylation, histone methylation, chromatin remodeling, pseudogene, and microRNA etc. Monozygotic twins is developed from one single zygote and are genetically identical in genomic DNA sequence. From the view of classical genetics, traditional genetic markers such as short tandem repeat and single nucleotide polymorphism can not play important role in discriminating monozygotic twins. So it is very essential to find new genetic markers. Recent achievements made in epigenetics show that there exist striking differences in monozygotic twins and provide a new strategy to discriminate the monozygotic twins. In this paper, the concepts, research contents of epigenetics and its application perspective in discriminating monozygotic twins are reviewed.",

    "abstract": "We describe our experience with 22 conjoined twins managed from 1974 to 2006.\nRecords of 22 conjoined twins admitted from 1974 to 2006 were reviewed. Interviews with attending physicians were also conducted.\nThere were 11 thoracopagus, 5 omphalopagus, 3 ischiopagus, 2 craniopagus, and 1 pygopagus twins. Five thoracopagus twins were deemed inseparable due to severe cardiac anomalies. One ischiopagus refused separation, and one craniopagus was separated elsewhere. Six twins (three omphalopagus, one each of pygopagus, ischiopagus, and thoracopagus) were separated emergently as neonates; only one twin is a long-term survivor. Mortalities were due to intractable acidosis, sepsis, and hemorrhage. Nine twins (one craniopagus, one ischiopagus, two omphalopagus, five thoracopagus) were electively separated between 9 months and 2 years of age. One set of these thoracopagus twins died of respiratory failure and sepsis post-operatively. A hydrocephalic twin in another thoracopagus twin died intraoperatively. The rest are alive and well.\nEmergency separations yielded dismal results due to poor patient conditions; delay in separation allowed progressive deterioration and resultant poor outcome. Elective separation had more favorable results due to well-planned strategies, team preparedness, and better patient conditions. A multi-disciplinary approach, with parental participation, is integral in the holistic management of conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "Research into the genetic effects and specific genes associated with retinal vascular caliber, a risk marker of cardiovascular diseases, may provide new insights into the genetic contribution of early microvascular disease. A combined 374 monozygotic and 536 dizygotic twin pairs and 322 siblings from the Twins Eye Study in Tasmania and the Brisbane Adolescent Twin Study underwent complete ophthalmic examinations, including retinal photography, and bilateral retinal vascular caliber was measured. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate the heritability. Genome-wide linkage analysis was conducted on 836 individuals from 381 Brisbane Adolescent Twin Study families, with adjustments for age, sex, and other covariates. The heritabilities for the retinal arteriolar caliber were 59.4% (95% CI: 53.2% to 64.7%) and 56.5% (95% CI: 50.1% to 61.9%) in the Twins Eye Study in Tasmania and the Brisbane Adolescent Twin Study, respectively, and for venular caliber they were 61.7% (95% CI: 55.6% to 67.0%) and 64.2% (95% CI: 58.7% to 68.8%), respectively, after adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index. Two multipoint peaks detected on chromosomes 3p12.3 and 8p23.1 for retinal arteriolar caliber had suggestive linkage, with the highest multipoint peak logarithm of odds score of 2.24 on chromosome 8p23.1 (genome-wide P=7.0 x 10(-4)). Two suggestive logarithm of odds scores for venular caliber were identified on chromosomes 2p14 and 9q21.13. The largest multipoint logarithm of odds score was 2.69 on chromosome 2p14 (genome-wide P=2.0 x 10(-4)). In this large twin population, genetic factors appear to play a significant role in the variation of retinal vascular caliber. Several putative loci were identified for the retinal vascular caliber.",

    "abstract": "Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) are widely used markers of liver disease. Several population-based cohort studies have found associations of these liver enzymes with all-cause mortality. None of these studies controlled for genetic variation as well as fetal and early life exposure, whether environmental or genetic.\nWe studied the associations of ALT and GGT with all-cause mortality using data for 686 twins (73-94 years old) included in the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins.\nAn increase in 1 logged U/L of GGT was associated with a 15% increase in the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99, 1.32] but there was no strong evidence of an association of ALT with all-cause mortality (HR=1.07, 95% CI 0.82, 1.40) when controlling for potential confounders. In this analysis, the study population was treated as individuals, with similarities between twins accounted for by using robust standard errors. However, an intrapair analysis in which the proportion of twin pairs in which the twin with the higher level of ALT or GGT died first was compared with 50% (expected under the null hypothesis), found no strong evidence that higher ALT or GGT was associated with earlier death within twin pairs; the results were consistent in both monozygotic and dizygotic twins.\ngamma-glutamyltransferase but not ALT predicts mortality among older Danish twins when using traditional methods for controlling for potential confounders and existing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Environmental developmental origins may explain the association, but larger twin studies are required to replicate our findings.",

We calculated genetic and environmental contributions to strabismus based upon a critical review and quantitative meta-analysis of previous strabismus twin studies (n=3418 twin pairs) and calculated contributions to phoria based upon a new twin study (n=307 twin pairs). Our results suggest that genetic liability is necessary to develop strabismus, whereas environmental factors are sufficient to cause most phorias. The different etiologies implied by this work suggest that strabismus and phoria should be carefully distinguished in epidemiological work.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is capable of modulating coordinate expression of large numbers of genes across many different pathways, and may therefore warrant investigation for their potential role between genes and disease phenotype. In a rare set of monozygotic twins discordant for Alzheimer's disease (AD), significantly reduced levels of DNA methylation were observed in temporal neocortex neuronal nuclei of the AD twin. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms may mediate at the molecular level the effects of life events on AD risk, and provide, for the first time, a potential explanation for AD discordance despite genetic similarities.",

    "abstract": "The protein complex AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is believed to play an important role in the regulation of skeletal muscle glucose and lipid metabolism. Defects in the AMPK system might therefore be an important factor in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to identify genetic and environmental mechanisms involved in the regulation of AMPK expression and activity and to examine the association between AMPK protein levels and activity on the one hand, and glucose and fat metabolism on the other. We investigated skeletal muscle biopsies from 100 young and 82 older mono- and dizygotic nondiabetic twins excised during the basal and insulin-stimulated states of a physiological hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. AMPKalpha1, -alpha2, and -gamma3 mRNA expression was investigated using real-time PCR, and Western blotting was employed to measure protein levels. Multiple regression analyses indicated that skeletal muscle AMPK mRNA and protein expression as well as activity were regulated by sex, age, obesity, and aerobic capacity. Comparison of intraclass correlations on AMPK measurements from mono- and dizygotic twins suggested that skeletal muscle AMPK expression was under minor genetic influence. AMPKgamma3 protein expression and activity were negatively related to whole body glucose uptake through the nonoxidative metabolic pathway and positively related to phosphorylation of glycogen synthase. Our results suggest that skeletal muscle AMPK expression is under minor genetic control but regulated by age and sex and associated with obesity and aerobic capacity. Furthermore, our results indicate a role for gamma3-containing AMPK complexes in downregulation of insulin-stimulated nonoxidative glucose metabolism possibly through inhibition of glycogen synthase activity.",

    "abstract": "This case study examined case histories, diagnostic features, and treatment response in two 79-year-old male monozygotic (identical) twins with vocal fold bowing, exploring both genetic and environmental factors. DNA concordance was examined via cheek swab. Case histories, videostroboscopy, auditory- and visual-perceptual assessment, electromyography, acoustic measures, and Voice Handicap ratings were undertaken. Both twins underwent surgical intervention and subsequent voice therapy. Monozygosity was confirmed for DNA polymorphisms, with 10 of 10 concordance for STR DNA markers. For both twins, auditory- and visual-perceptual assessments indicated severe bowing, hoarseness, and breathiness, although Twin 1 was judged to be extremely severe. Differences in reference to root-mean-square amplitudes were observed for thyroarytenoid and lateral cricoarytenoid muscles, with smaller relative amplitudes observed for the Twin 1 versus Twin 2. No consistent voice improvement was observed after surgical intervention(s), despite improved mid-membranous vocal fold closure. Marked reductions in Voice Handicap Index total scores were observed after behavioral voice therapy, coinciding with increased mid-membranous and posterior laryngeal (interarytenoid) glottal closure. No substantive differences in acoustic measures were observed. Vocal fold bowing was more severe for Twin 1 versus Twin 2 despite identical heritability factors. Overall voice improvement with treatment was greater for Twin 2 than Twin 1. Environmental factors might partially account for the differences observed between the twins, including variability in their responsiveness to behavioral voice therapy. Voice therapy was useful in improving mid-membranous and posterior laryngeal closure, although dysphonia remained severe in both cases.",

    "abstract": "Osteochondritis dissecans is a lesion of subchondral bone with subsequent involvement of the overlying cartilage. Although the etiology of the disease is unknown, mechanical, traumatic, and ischemic etiologies have been suggested, in addition to developmental and genetic factors. There are several treatment options depending on the stage of the disease and surgeon preference. The use of a fresh osteochondral allograft for treatment of a lesion of the femoral condyle is relatively new, and we report its use in a unique situation involving identical twins who both presented with osteochondritis dissecans of the same anatomic location within 2 years of each other. Since these were identical lesions in identical twins, this commonality supports the suggestion that some genetic component may be present in the etiology, especially in this situation where a genetic connection existed. We recommend genetic studies to determine the extent of genetic influence on the disease.",

    "abstract": "The aims of the study were to compare performance of twins with bipolar disorder (BPD) and healthy co-twins in neuropsychological tests assessing various aspects of executive functioning and to examine the relationship of clinical factors with executive functions. Twenty-six euthymic BPD twins, 19 co-twins, and 114 control twins were examined using the Stroop test, the Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST), the trail making test (TMT), and semantic and phonemic verbal fluency tests. BPD twins and co-twins performed worse than controls in the Stroop test. BPD twins scored lower than controls in semantic fluency. Clinical factors correlated with scores in TMT, WCST, and semantic fluency. Our results suggest that the response inhibition impairment may associate with genetic risk of BPD and represent a potential endophenotype for BPD. The impaired performance in the semantic fluency test among the patients may result from semantic memory retrieval problems.",

    "abstract": "In three studies, a General Factor of Personality (GFP) was found to occupy the apex of the hierarchical structure. In Study 1, a GFP emerged independent of method variance and accounted for 54% of the reliable variance in a multitrait-multimethod assessment of 391 Italian high school students that used self-, teacher-, and parent-ratings on the Big Five Questionnaire - Children. In Study 2, a GFP was found in the seven dimensions of Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory as well as the Big Five of the NEO PI-R, with the GFPtci correlating r = .72 with the GFPneo. These results indicate that the GFP is practically the same in both test batteries, and its existence does not depend on being extracted using the Big Five model. The GFP accounted for 22% of the total variance in these trait measures, which were assessed in 651 pairs of 14- to 30-year-old Japanese twins. In Study 3, a GFP accounted for 32% of the total variance in nine scales derived from the NEO PI-R, the Humor Styles Questionnaire, and the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire assessed in 386 pairs of 18- to 74-year-old Canadian and U.S. twins. The GFP was found to be 50% heritable with high scores indicating openness, conscientiousness, sociability, agreeableness, emotional stability, good humor and emotional intelligence. The possible evolutionary origins of the GFP are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of genetic and environmental contributions to preterm birth is not straightforward in family studies, as etiology could involve both maternal and fetal genes. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are presented as a flexible approach for defining user-specified covariance structures to handle multiple random effects and hierarchical dependencies inherent in children of twin (COT) studies of pregnancy outcomes. The proposed method is easily modified to allow for the study of gestational age as a continuous trait and as a binary outcome reflecting the presence or absence of preterm birth. Estimation of fetal and maternal genetic factors and the effect of the environment are demonstrated using MCMC methods implemented in WinBUGS and maximum likelihood methods in a Virginia COT sample comprising 7,061 births. In summary, although the contribution of maternal and fetal genetic factors was supported using both outcomes, additional births and/or extended relationships are required to precisely estimate both genetic effects simultaneously. We anticipate the flexibility of MCMC methods to handle increasingly complex models to be of particular relevance for the study of birth outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The effect of breastfeeding on cognitive abilities is examined in the offspring of highly educated women and compared to the effects in women with low or middle educational attainment. All offspring consisted of 12-year old mono- or dizygotic twins and this made it possible to study the effect of breastfeeding on mean cognition scores as well as the moderating effects of breastfeeding on the heritability of variation in cognition. Information on breastfeeding and cognitive ability was available for 6,569 children. Breastfeeding status was prospectively assessed in the first years after birth of the children. Maternal education is positively associated with performance on a standardized test for cognitive ability in offspring. A significant effect of breastfeeding on cognition was also observed. The effect was similar for offspring with mothers with a high, middle, and low educational level. Breast-fed children of highly educated mothers score on average 7.6 point higher on a standardized test of cognitive abilities (CITO test; range 500\u2013550; effects size = .936) than formula-fed children of mothers with a low education. Individual differences in cognition scores are largely accounted for by additive genetic factors (80%) and breastfeeding does not modify the effect of genetic factors in any of the three strata of maternal education. Heritability was slightly lower in children with a mother with a middle-level education.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiologic studies suggest positive associations between poor oral health and cardiovascular disease. The authors undertook a prospective study among 15,273 Swedish twins (1963-2000) to examine whether genetic factors underlying the 2 diseases could explain previous associations. They estimated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals controlling for individual factors and stratifying on twin pairs to control for familial effects. Quantitative genetic analyses estimated genetic correlations between oral diseases and cardiovascular disease outcomes. Tooth loss (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 1.4) and periodontal disease (HR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.4) were associated with small excess risks of cardiovascular disease; periodontal disease was also associated with coronary heart disease (HR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.6). Adjustment for genetic factors in co-twin analyses did not appreciably change estimates. In contrast, tooth loss was more strongly associated with coronary heart disease in twin models (HR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.8) compared with adjusting for individual factors alone (HR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.4). There was evidence of shared genetic factors between cardiovascular disease and tooth loss (r(G) = 0.18) and periodontal disease (r(G) = 0.29). Oral disease was associated with excess cardiovascular disease risk, independent of genetic factors. There appear to be common pathogenetic mechanisms between poor oral health and cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "The role of middle cerebral artery (MCA) peak systolic velocity (PSV) has become established in the management of fetal anemia. To date, singleton reference ranges have also been used in twin pregnancies. However, in monochorionic twin pregnancies, normal ranges for cerebral blood flow may differ from those in singletons owing to intertwin blood exchange. We aimed to establish gestational age-specific reference ranges for MCA-PSV in monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies, to compare them with previously reported singleton reference ranges, and to establish terms for calculating conditional reference intervals appropriate for individual serial measurements.\nIn a prospective longitudinal study we examined 50 uncomplicated MCDA pregnancies that were recruited between 11 and 14 weeks of gestation. Fetal MCA Doppler waveforms were assessed biweekly from 15 weeks of gestation onwards. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate gestational age-specific reference ranges for MCA-PSV and terms for conditional reference intervals were established.\nBased on 824 observations in 100 fetuses, normative ranges from 15 to 37 weeks of gestation were constructed. Median MCA-PSV increased with advancing gestational age. Measurements between 18 and 37 weeks were comparable to those in singletons. However, before 18 weeks MCA-PSV values were higher in MCDA twin pregnancies compared with singleton references.\nBetween 18 and 37 weeks of gestation, reference ranges of singletons can be used to assess fetal anemia in MCDA twin pregnancies. Prior to 18 weeks the application of singleton references may lead to an increased number of false-positive diagnoses of presumed fetal anemia in MCDA twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Anencephaly occurs in 1.4-4.7 per 10,000 deliveries and is thought to result from failed closure of the anterior neuropore at 24-26 days post fertilization. Among twins, risk for congenital malformations is greatest among monozygotic twins. Several occurrences of twin pairs being discordant for neural tube defects have been reported: 1 twin affected with anencephaly and co-twin affected with holoprosencephaly, spina bifida or encephalocele, is consistent with a multifactorial pattern of inheritance. We present an instance of monochorionic diamniotic twins concordant for anencephaly.\nAn 18-year-old, gravida 1, para 0, Caucasian woman presented with monochorionic diamniotic twin gestation at 22 weeks. Prenatal ultrasound identified polyhydramnios, anencephaly, ventricular septal defect and suspected rocker-bottom feet in twin A. Twin B was identified as anencephalic, with left renal agenesis and spinal distortion visualized on ultrasound. Postnatal cytogenetic evaluations of placenta, umbilical cord blood and fetal skin samples from both twins revealed 46,XX karyotypes.\nA rare case of a monochorionic diamniotic gestation concordant for anencephaly is presented. Previously published reports of concordant twin anencephaly have postulated a possible autosomal recessive or multifactorial mode of inheritance. Subsequent pregnancies with anencephaly or other open neural tube defects would indicate a mendelian process.",

    "abstract": "Activity level (AL) is a highly salient feature of child behaviour that has been linked to developmental outcome. Twin studies of parent-rated, observer-rated and mechanically assessed AL in childhood find that AL is genetically influenced. Few studies, however, consider whether different methods of assessing AL have a shared genetic etiology. Those that do, confound methods and situations. The present study examined whether actigraph and rater-based (parent, observer) measures of AL tap the same genetic influences in a sample of 312 2-year-old twin pairs. Methods were studied within the same situation, thereby controlling for situational influences on AL. The genetic correlation between actigraph and parent-rated AL in the home was .38, indicating modest genetic overlap between the two methods. In contrast, the correlation of genetic effects on actigraph and observer-rated AL in the laboratory was .95, indicating that both laboratory-based measures of AL are influenced by the same genetic effects.",

    "abstract": "Optimism has been shown to be important in maintaining wellbeing into old age, but little is known about the sources of variation in optimism and its links to mental and somatic health. Optimism, mental, and self-rated health were measured in 3,053 twin individuals (501 MZF, 153 MZM, 274 DZF, 77 DZM, and 242 DZ opposite-sex twin pairs and 561 single twins) over 50 years using the life orientation test, the General Health Questionnaire and a single-item question for self-rated health. Additive genetic factors explained 36, 34, and 46% of the variation in optimism, mental, and self-rated health, respectively, with the remainder being due to non-shared environmental influences. Genetic influences accounted for most of the covariance between the variables (14-20% of the genetic variance) indicating that in older adults genes predisposing to high optimism also predispose to good mental health and self-rated health.",

    "abstract": "Empirical evidence on how parents of twins manage their need for sleep is nonexistent. Lay publications provide advice for parents of multiples, yet their recommendations have been neither studied for their frequency of use nor tested for their effectiveness. Parents of twins were interviewed by telephone regarding strategies they used to obtain sleep during the first 6 months postbirth. Reported strategies were grouped into a priori categories suggested by the literature. Findings indicated that parents attempted various strategies to increase their sleep but disagreed on their effectiveness. Development and testing of a repertoire of effective strategies tailored for parents of twins are needed.",

    "abstract": "Smoking is the main risk factor for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) but genetic factors are of importance, since only a subset of smokers develops the disease. Sex differences have been suggested both in disease prevalence and response to environmental exposures. Furthermore, it has been shown that acquisition of 'addiction' to smoking is partly genetically mediated. Disease cases and smoking habits were identified in 44919 twins aged >40 years from the Swedish Twin Registry. Disease was defined as self-reported chronic bronchitis or emphysema, or recurrent cough with phlegm. The results showed that chronic bronchitis seems to be more prevalent among females, and that the heritability estimate for chronic bronchitis was a moderate 40% and only 14% of the genetic influences were shared by smoking. In addition, 392 twins have been invited to a clinical investigation to evaluate: (i) to what extent genetic factors contribute to individual differences (variation) in FEV(1) (forced expiratory volume in 1 s), vital capacity and DL(CO) (diffusion capacity), taking sex into consideration, and (ii) whether smoking behaviour and respiratory symptoms influence these estimates.",

    "abstract": "Investigating neuroanatomic differences in monozygotic twins who are discordant for autism can help unravel the relative contributions of genetics and environment to this pervasive developmental disorder. The authors used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate several brain regions of interest in monozygotic twins who varied in degree of phenotypic discordance for narrowly defined autism.\nThe subjects were 14 pairs of monozygotic twins between the ages of 5 and 14 years old and 14 singleton age- and gender-matched typically developing comparison subjects. The monozygotic twin group was a cohort of children with narrowly defined autistic deficits and their co-twins who presented with varying levels of autistic deficits. High-resolution MRIs were acquired and volumetric/area measurements obtained for the frontal lobe, amygdala, and hippocampus and subregions of the prefrontal cortex, corpus callosum, and cerebellar vermis.\nNo neurovolumetric/area differences were found between twin pairs. Relative to typically developing comparison subjects, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volumes and anterior areas of the corpus callosum were significantly altered in autistic twins, and volumes of the posterior vermis were altered in both autistic twins and co-twins. Intraclass correlation analysis of brain volumes between children with autism and their co-twins indicated that the degree of within-pair neuroanatomic concordance varied with brain region. In the group of subjects with narrowly defined autism only, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and posterior vermis volumes were significantly associated with the severity of autism based on scores from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic.\nThese findings support previous research demonstrating alterations in the prefrontal cortex, corpus callosum, and posterior vermis in children with autism and further suggest that alterations are associated with the severity of the autism phenotype. Continued research involving twins who are concordant and discordant for autism is essential to disentangle the genetic and environmental contributions to autism.",

    "abstract": "To explore the program of preoperative evaluation, preoperative preparation and separation operation of pygopagus conjoined twins.\nClinical data of one case of pygopagus (male, gestational age 37 weeks, uterine-incision delivery, 3.5 months old; twins of triplets; total body weight 8.0 kg. The twins have self-governed extremities, anus, penis. Four limbs can move independently). Separated successfully were analyzed. The auxiliary examination of X-rays, MRI, ultrasound, CT and 3D reconstruction, sensory evoked potential showed that there were process hypoplasia and lamina bifid of lumbosacral vertebrae below L3. Dural sac connected below L3 and conus medullaris located at L3. There were no conjunction of spinal cord and cauda equine. The decision of direct suture of dural sac was made by preoperative evaluation through measurement of circumference and area of conjoined dural sac. The separation surgery program was decided through team debate and sham operation. Separation operation was performed under the general anaesthesia. Crossing V-shaped skin flap was used to cover the wound surface. The dura of conjoined twins were sutured directly. The tension of skin flap was normal postoperative with continuing negative pressure drainage under the flap and pressure sterilized dressing.\nSuccessful separation of pygopagus conjoined twins was achieved. Lower extremities movements of separated twins were normal 6 h after operation. The drainage was removed 1 day postoperative, blood supplies of skin flap were normal. There were no complications of infection, cerebrospinal fluid leakage and neurological deficit. The healing of the skin flap was good. With 6 months follow-up, the growth and neurological function were normal.\nConsummate preoperative preparation, accurate preoperative investigations, meticulous operative management, careful postoperative administration and good team cooperation are the keys to successful separation of pygopagus conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "The association between abdominal obesity and atherogenic lipid profile emerges from complex interactions of genes and environment. We aimed to explore the heritability and effects of overweight on serum lipid profile (high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), HDL mean particle size, percentages of HDL(2b, 2a, 3a, 3b, and 3c,) low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), LDL peak particle size and triglycerides (TGs)) in healthy, young adults. HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG were measured in 52 monozygotic (MZ) and 89 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, aged 23-32 years, chosen to represent a wide range of BMIs (17.6-42.9 kg/m2). Of them, 24 MZ and 26 DZ pairs were chosen at random for measurements of HDL mean and LDL peak particle sizes and percentages of HDL subspecies. The heritabilities of the lipid parameters adjusted for BMI were HDL-C 73%, HDL mean particle size 56%, HDL subspecies 46-63%, LDL-C 79%, LDL peak particle size 49%, and TG 64%. Genetic and environmental correlations between BMI and HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG were modest (0.3-0.4). Abdominal overweight (waist circumference>or=94 cm for males and >or=80 cm for females) associated with decreased HDL-C, increased LDL-C, and TG concentrations, smaller HDL mean particle size, lower HDL2b, and higher HDL3c percentages in both genders. Within MZ twins, controlling for genetic influences, within-pair differences in HDL3c percentage were associated with those in waist (r=0.46, P=0.032) and BMI (r=0.51, P=0.013). In conclusion, serum lipid parameters, including LDL peak and HDL mean particle sizes and HDL subspecies distribution are under strong genetic control. Overweight associated with significant lipid profile changes, particularly, small HDL3c increased in overweight independent of genetic influences.",

    "abstract": "Pseudo-merohedral twins are frequently observed in crystals displaying pseudo-symmetry. In these crystals, many [u v w] zone axis electron diffraction patterns are very close and can only be distinguished from intensity considerations. On conventional diffraction patterns (selected-area electron diffraction or microdiffraction), a strong dynamical behaviour averages the diffracted intensities so that only the positions of the reflections on a pattern can be considered. On precession electron diffraction patterns, the diffracted beams display an integrated intensity and a \"few-beam\" or \"systematic row\" behaviour prevails which strongly reduces the dynamical interactions. Therefore the diffracted intensity can be taken into account. A procedure based on observation of the weak extra-reflections connected with the pseudo-symmetry is given to identify without ambiguity any zone axis. It is successfully applied to the identification and characterization of {1 2 1} reflection twins present in the LaGaO(3) perovskite.",

    "abstract": "To explore the value of imaging in the preoperative evaluation of pygopagus conjoined twins (PCT), and analyze the significance of imaging for separation surgery plan and prognosis.\nImaging data of a case with PCT, including ultrasound, X-ray, CT, MRI were collected from the case with PCTs treated in our hospital. The features of the images were analyzed for identification of the conjoined region, size, and structures and for judgement of other organ malformation and general body state.\nThe conjoined region located at the lumbosacral spine of which anteroposterior diameter was 7.9 cm, and 6.0 cm for cranial-caudal diameter. Spina bifida were found below L3 in bilateral twins. There were no bone structures but cartilage fusion in spine and pelvis. The neural structure such as spinal cord and cauda equina, lower GI tract and anus, and urinary tract were separated. The dural sac were fused. There were cryptorchidism in one twin, patent ductus arteriosus in both twins. The intraoperative finding matched with imaging results. Crossing V-shaped skin flap was used to cover the wound surface. The dura of conjoined twins were sutured. Successful separation of the PCT was achieved. There were no complications of infection, cerebrospinal fluid leakage and neurological deficit. The healing of the skin flap was good. With 6 months follow-up, the growth and neurological function were normal.\nImaging methods were selected according to the type of conjoined twins and the clinical symptoms and signs. The radiologic investigation can reveal the structure and size of conjunction area. Imaging investigation has important significance for the prediction of difficulty in surgery, selection of surgical procedures, and evaluation of prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Our previous investigation found that the same genes influence poor reading and mathematics performance in 10-year-olds. Here we assess whether this finding extends to language and general cognitive disabilities, as well as replicating the earlier finding for reading and mathematics in an older and larger sample.\nUsing a representative sample of 4000 pairs of 12-year-old twins from the UK Twins Early Development Study, we investigated the genetic and environmental overlap between internet-based batteries of language and general cognitive ability tests in addition to tests of reading and mathematics for the bottom 15% of the distribution using DeFries-Fulker extremes analysis. We compared these results to those for the entire distribution.\nAll four traits were highly correlated at the low extreme (average group phenotypic correlation = .58). and in the entire distribution (average phenotypic correlation = .59). Genetic correlations for the low extreme were consistently high (average = .67), and non-shared environmental correlations were modest (average = .23). These results are similar to those seen across the entire distribution (.68 and .23, respectively).\nThe 'Generalist Genes Hypothesis' holds for language and general cognitive disabilities, as well as reading and mathematics disabilities. Genetic correlations were high, indicating a strong degree of overlap in genetic influences on these diverse traits. In contrast, non-shared environmental influences were largely specific to each trait, causing phenotypic differentiation of traits.",

    "abstract": "The aims of the present study are to describe the secular trend of breast-feeding rates in Japanese twins in comparison with the general population, and then to clarify the maternal and infants' obstetric factors associated with breast-feeding in twins.\nBreast-feeding rates from 0 to 6 full months and related maternal and infant obstetric factors were analyzed using 4,023 Japanese twins, consisting of two different volunteer-based twin samples, age 1-15 years, whose birth year ranged from 1968 to 2003. Data were collected through mailed or hand-delivered questionnaires. Obstetric factors that affect full and partial breast-feeding of twins were confirmed using logistic analyses according to birth order in twin pairs, adjusted by birth year.\nThe full breast-feeding rates of twins were lower than those of the general population. On the other hand, the combined rates of full and partial breast-feeding were close to those of general population, except for the period 1968-1974. The percentage of concordance pares was around 95% for all months. The most influential factor that negatively correlated with breast-feeding from 0 to 6 months was gestational weeks. Higher maternal age at twin birth and the use of an incubator also prevented breast-feeding in the neonatal period.\nThe results of the present study for the first time indicated that full breast-feeding of twins has risen recently in Japan, although the rates are still lower than those of the general population. The importance of the gestational weeks for breast-feeding rates was also shown.",

The diagnosis of monochorionicity was initially done during first-trimester ultrasound evaluation and then confirmed by postnatal placental pathology. Furthermore, both twins were found to have blood chimerism. We also review the literature on dizygotic-monochorionic twins and blood-chimerism. We suggest that further prospective postnatal genetic studies are needed to define the reliability of prenatal diagnosis of identical twins in cases of monochorionicity.",

    "abstract": "To assess the genetic and environmental influences on the inter-individual variability of spectral EEG parameters under two conditions of reduced visual input in preschoolers.\nEEG was recorded in 21 monozygotic and 20 same-sex dizygotic twin pairs aged 5-6 years under the Closed eyes and Darkness conditions. The contributions of genetic and environmental influences to individual EEG parameters were estimated using structural equation modeling.\nThe alpha rhythm parameters - both spectral amplitude and frequency - were influenced mainly by genetic factors. Theta spectral amplitude variance was presumably accounted for by both genetic and shared environmental factors. The difference in the nature of population variance between EEG alpha and theta band spectral amplitudes was reproduced for two identical functional loads: Closed eyes and Darkness.\nThe majority of EEG spectral parameters in preschool children are determined by genetic factors. Tentative finding on systematic environmental influences on theta spectral amplitude under the condition of reduced visual input may point to the role of experience in the individual differences in the functioning of theta response system.\nThe findings contribute to the scanty knowledge about the heritability of EEG rhythms in preschool children.",

    "abstract": "Selective resuscitation refers to the practice of providing resuscitative efforts to one or some (but not all) infants born in the setting of multiple gestation. When one fetus is known to have a severe anomaly or severe growth restriction, parents are sometimes offered this option. In the setting of extreme prematurity, in the absence of an anomaly or severe growth restriction, parents are generally expected to make one unified decision for all the infants involved. The introduction of the Outcome Estimator, a tool that provides the ability to make individual outcome predictions for each fetus in a multiple gestation at borderline gestational age, based on contributing variables such as weight and gender, has led to the ethical dilemma of whether parents in this setting should also be offered the option of selective resuscitation. No convincing ethical argument for denying the parents the right to decide for each individual infant is apparent.",

    "abstract": "A relation between birth weight and adult body composition has been reported in singleton populations, especially when more accurate measures of body composition, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were used. It remains uncertain whether this is mediated by a direct effect of fetal nutrition, through factors in the shared environment, or through genetic factors.\nThe objective was to investigate the relation between birth weight and body composition with the use of a co-twin design.\nDXA measurements and birth weights were available for 2228 dizygotic and 842 monozygotic female twins aged between 18 and 80 y. Multivariate regression models were used to identify both individual specific relations and those mediated through the shared environment.\nSignificant relations were found between birth weight and DXA measures for individuals. A 1-kg increase in birth weight was associated with a 1.72-kg increase in lean mass, a 0.25-kg increase in fat mass, and a 0.05-unit increase in the lean:fat mass ratio. Within twin pairs, the analysis showed that associations between birth weight and absolute levels of lean and fat mass were mediated through individual-specific effects, whereas the relation between birth weight and the proportion of lean to fat mass was mediated purely through factors common to twin pairs.\nA higher birth weight is associated with a higher proportion of lean to fat mass as adults. However, these analyses suggest that this association is not determined by individual specific factors in utero (eg, fetal nutrition) but through factors in the shared common environment of the twins.",

In males (47.4% of subjects), the mean (SD) 25(OH)D level was 12.1 (4.2) ng/ml in non-summer and 27.4 (8.8) ng/ml in summer; in females, it was 10.1 (4.1) ng/ml in non-summer and 19.5 (6.3) ng/ml in summer. A multivariate model that included gender, age, season, physical activity, and student status demonstrated that male gender, summer season, and high physical activity significantly increased 25(OH)D levels. Summer season and male gender also significantly decreased the risk of being in the lowest 25(OH)D tertile. Overall, 68.9% of the variability in 25(OH)D level was attributable to additive genetic influence. Stratification by gender found that in males, 85.9% of the variability in 25(OH)D level was attributable to such influence, but in females, it was only 17%.\nIn this sample of rural Chinese adolescents, 25(OH)D level was influenced by gender, season, and physical activity level.

    "abstract": "The ages of onset in multiple sclerosis cases span more than 7 decades. Data are presented for affected relative pairs from a Canadian population base of 30,000 multiple sclerosis index cases (1993-2008). The effects of genetic sharing, parent of origin, intergenerational versus collinear differences, and gender on the ages of onset were evaluated in the following concordant pairs: monozygotic twins (n = 29), dizygotic twins (n = 10), siblings (n = 614), first cousins (n = 405), half siblings (n = 29), parent/child (n = 285), and aunt/uncle/niece/nephew (avunculars) (n = 289). Fisher's z test assessed intraclass correlation (r) for ages of onset. Correlations for monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, full siblings, and first cousins were 0.60, 0.54, 0.20, and 0.10, respectively. Dizygotic twins resembled monozygotic twins more than siblings. The age-of-onset correlation for maternal half siblings (r = 0.37) was higher than that for paternal half siblings (r = 0.26), consistent with other observations suggesting an intrauterine environmental effect on multiple sclerosis risk. Intergenerational comparisons are complicated by substantial increases of multiple sclerosis incidence over time. Genetic loading (familial vs. sporadic cases) did not generally influence the age of onset, but correlation of age of onset in multiple sclerosis relative pairs was proportional to genetic sharing. A maternal parent-of-origin effect on the age of onset in collinear generations was suggested.",

    "abstract": "One known genetic mechanism for transient neonatal diabetes is loss of methylation at 6q24. The etiology of prune belly sequence is unknown but a genetic defect, affecting the mesoderm from which the triad abdominal muscle hypoplasia, urinary tract abnormalities, and cryptorchidism develop, has been suggested. We investigated a family, including one twin, with transient neonatal diabetes and prune belly sequence. Autoantibody tests excluded type 1 diabetes. Microsatellite marker analysis confirmed the twins being monozygotic. We identified no mutations in ZFP57, KCNJ11, ABCC8, GCK, HNF1A, HNF1B, HNF3B, IPF1, PAX4, or ZIC3. The proband had loss of methylation at the 6q24 locus TNDM and also at the loci IGF2R, DIRAS3, and PEG1, while the other family members, including the healthy monozygotic twin, had normal findings. The loss of methylation on chromosome 6q24 and elsewhere may indicate a generalized maternal hypomethylation syndrome, which accounts for both transient neonatal diabetes and prune belly sequence.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic twin pregnancies (MC) are associated with a higher risk of complications than their bichorionic equivalents. When two fetuses share the same placenta, the two fetal circulations are closely bound by omnipresent vascular anastomoses. The determination of the chorionicity is essential for an adequate management of these particular pregnancies. The twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is one of the. possible complications and must be considered as an obstetrical emergency. Severe growth restriction of one twin occurs in 11% of MC pregnancies. Before the limit of viability, in some of the cases, selective foeticide using particular methods are mandatory to preserve the wellbeing of the healthy twin. The invasive procedures carried out at the time these complications occur proved their effectiveness, under the condition of being applied by experienced experts. Laser coagulation, TTTS gold standard treatment, is associated with a fetal survival rate equal or higher than 75%. Among MC twins, selective foeticide with bipolar cord coagulation allows an intact survival rate of the other twin in more than 75 to 80% of the cases.",

    "abstract": "The physiological serum levels of steroids and pituitary hormones in older men and women have been sparsely reported in the literature.\nThe aims of this study were to investigate the normal variation and sex differences in steroids and pituitary hormones in those aged >70 years, and to study the interrelation between these hormones and indicators of the metabolic syndrome, inflammatory activity, and renal function.\nThe investigation comprised a population-based sample of pairs of white opposite-sex twins from the Swedish Twin Registry. At baseline in 1996 and at the 8-year follow-uup in 2004, serum levels of progesterone, cortisol, testosterone, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP), and urea were analyzed. Serum levels of insulin and cystatin were analyzed only at the follow-up.\nThe study sample included 219 men and 183 women aged 71 to 80 years (mean [SD], 74.5 [2.5] years) at baseline in 1996, and 127 men and 135 women at follow-uup in 2004. At baseline, in both men and women, the variation of progesterone in serum was positively correlated with that of estradiol (men: r = 0.226, P < 0.01; women: r = 0.115, P = NS), testosterone (men: r = 0.178, P < 0.01; women: r = 0.315, P < 0.001), and cortisol (men: r = 0.314, P < 0.001; women: r = 0.296, P < 0.001). The values of progesterone and other steroid hormones were associated with markers of insulin resistance (iie, insulin, waist circumference), inflammatory activity (ie, CRP) for progesterone (men: r = 0.267, P < 0.001; women: r = 0.150, P < 0.05), and renal function (ie, creatinine) for progesterone (men: r = 0.424, P < 0.001; women: r = 0.212, P < 0.01). Estradiol and prolactin were associated with insulin resistance, inflammation, and renal function. Furthermore, progesterone was associated with prolactin (men: r = 0.275, P < 0.001; women: r = 0.172, P < 0.05).. Among both men and women, there was a strong correlation between testosterone and estradiol (men: r = 0.753, P < 0.001; women: r = 0.526, P < 0.001); in women, there was also a link between testosterone and cortisol at follow-up (r = 0.340, P < 0.01). For progesterone, there was a significant correlation between the values of the co-twins (in 1996: r = 0.16, P < 0.05; in 2004: r = 0.45, P < 0.001). Higher serum levels of progesterone (2.0 [0.7] nmol/L in men and 1.7 [0.8] nmol/L in women) and prolactin (6 [5] microg/L in men and 8 [10] microg/L in women) were found among those who were deceased at follow-up compared with survivors (progesterone: 1.8 [0.5] nmol/L in men and 1.4 [0.6] nmol/L in women, P < 0.01; prolactin: 4 [3] microg/L in men and 5 [2] microg/L in women, P < 0.001).\nIn this study of opposite-sex Swedish twins aged >70 years, there was a sex difference in the serum levels of steroids and pituitary hormones between men and women. Progesterone and other steroid hormones were associated with markers of insulin resistance, inflammatory activity, and renal function. Progesterone and prolactin levels were associated with increased risk of mortality in this sample.",

    "abstract": "The Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a growth disorder for which an increased frequency of monozygotic (MZ) twinning has been reported. With few exceptions, these twins are discordant for BWS and for females. Here, we describe the molecular and phenotypic analysis of 12 BWS twins and a triplet; seven twins are MZ, monochorionic and diamniotic, three twins are MZ, dichorionic and diamniotic and three twins are dizygotic. Twelve twins are female. In the majority of the twin pairs (11 of 13), the defect on chromosome 11p15 was hypomethylation of the paternal allele of DMR2. In 5 of 10 twins, there was additional hypomethylation of imprinted loci; in most cases, the loci affected were maternally methylated, but in two cases, hypomethylation of the paternally methylated DLK1 and H19 DMRs was detected, a novel finding in BWS. In buccal swabs of the MZ twins who share a placenta, the defect was present only in the affected twin; comparable hypomethylation in lymphocytes was detected in both the twins. The level of hypomethylation reached levels below 25%. The exchange of blood cells through vascular connections cannot fully explain the degree of hypomethylation found in the blood cell of the non-affected twin. We propose an additional mechanism through which sharing of aberrant methylation patterns in discordant twins, limited to blood cells, might occur. In a BWS-discordant MZ triplet, an intermediate level of demethylation was found in one of the non-affected sibs; this child showed mild signs of BWS. This finding supports the theory that a methylation error proceeds and possibly triggers the twinning process.",

    "abstract": "Chronic fatiguing illness remains a poorly understood syndrome of unknown pathogenesis. We attempted to identify biomarkers for chronic fatiguing illness using microarrays to query the transcriptome in peripheral blood leukocytes.\nCases were 44 individuals who were clinically evaluated and found to meet standard international criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome or idiopathic chronic fatigue, and controls were their monozygotic co-twins who were clinically evaluated and never had even one month of impairing fatigue. Biological sampling conditions were standardized and RNA stabilizing media were used. These methodological features provide rigorous control for bias resulting from case-control mismatched ancestry and experimental error. Individual gene expression profiles were assessed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays.\nThere were no significant differences in gene expression for any transcript.\nContrary to our expectations, we were unable to identify a biomarker for chronic fatiguing illness in the transcriptome of peripheral blood leukocytes suggesting that positive findings in prior studies may have resulted from experimental bias.",

    "abstract": "Males and females often have different requirements during early development, leading to sex-specific interactions between developing offspring. In polytocous mammals, competition for limited resources in utero may be asymmetrical between the sexes, and androgens produced by male foetuses could have adverse effects on the development of females, with potentially long-lasting consequences. We show here, in an unmanaged population of Soay sheep, that female lambs with a male co-twin have reduced birth weight relative to those with a female co-twin, while there was no such effect in male twins. In addition, females with a male co-twin had lower lifetime breeding success, which appeared to be mainly driven by differences in first-year survival. These results show that sex-specific sibling interactions can have long-term consequences for survival and reproduction, with potentially important implications for optimal sex allocation.",

    "abstract": "This study tested whether history of depression is associated with an increased likelihood of dementia, and whether a first depressive episode earlier in life is associated with increased dementia risk, or whether only depressive episodes close in time to dementia onset are related to dementia. Depression information came from national hospital discharge registries, medical history, and medical records. Dementia was diagnosed clinically. In case-control results, individuals with recent registry-identified depression were 3.9 times more likely than those with no registry-identified depression history to have dementia, whereas registry-identified depression earlier in life was not associated with dementia risk. Each 1-year increase in time between depression onset and dementia onset or equivalent age decreased the likelihood of dementia by 8.4%. In co-twin control analyses, twins with prior depression were 3.0 times more likely to have dementia than their nondepressed twin partners, with a similar age of depression gradient. These findings suggest that after partially controlling for genetic influences, late-life depression for many individuals may be a prodrome rather than a risk factor for dementia.",

    "abstract": "Studies of cerebral asymmetry can open doors to understanding the functional specialization of each brain hemisphere, and how this is altered in disease. Here we examined hemispheric asymmetries in fiber architecture using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 100 subjects, using high-dimensional fluid warping to disentangle shape differences from measures sensitive to myelination. Confounding effects of purely structural asymmetries were reduced by using co-registered structural images to fluidly warp 3D maps of fiber characteristics (fractional and geodesic anisotropy) to a structurally symmetric minimal deformation template (MDT). We performed a quantitative genetic analysis on 100 subjects to determine whether the sources of the remaining signal asymmetries were primarily genetic or environmental. A twin design was used to identify the heritable features of fiber asymmetry in various regions of interest, to further assist in the discovery of genes influencing brain micro-architecture and brain lateralization. Genetic influences and left/right asymmetries were detected in the fiber architecture of the frontal lobes, with minor differences depending on the choice of registration template.",

A detailed sonographic evaluation of the intracranial anatomy of the surviving twin was performed. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging was offered as well. The patient opted for termination. Evacuation was performed at 24 weeks, and pathologic evaluation revealed severe cerebral infarction with haemorrhage.\nHowever difficult, a multidisciplinary prenatal counselling should be performed in order to study the prognosis and to try to prevent cerebral palsy in the surviving co-twin.",

    "abstract": "The chiral pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ritodrine in patients pregnant with singletons and twins were investigated to determine the optimal use of ritodrine.\nEight and 20 patients with threatened preterm delivery of singletons and twins, respectively, were infused with ritodrine diastereomers. Serum concentrations of the drug were then measured using a newly developed method of chiral high-performance liquid chromatography.\nAlmost double the dosage of racemic ritodrine was required to prolong pregnancies with twins compared with those of singletons (2.20 +/- 1.06 vs. 1.24 +/- 0.36 microg/min per kilogram; p < 0.0001). The mean ratios of (-)-ritodrine to (+)-ritodrine in singleton and twin pregnancies were 1.17 +/- 0.10 and 1.16 +/- 0.10, respectively. However, the serum concentration and dosage ratio (C/D ratio) of (-)-ritodrine as significantly higher than that of (+)-ritodrine (p < 0.0001), whereas the clearance of (-)-ritodrine was significantly lower than that of (+)-ritodrine (p < 0.0001). A comparison of the gestation period (weeks) and diastereomer clearance did not reveal significant regression in the total analysis of the data obtained from singleton and twin pregnancies.\nThese results indicate that the clinical effectiveness of ritodrine diastereomers should be evaluated and that administration guidelines should be established based upon serum concentrations so that ritodrine can be more effectively administered to pregnant patients carrying either singletons or twins.",

Similar comparisons for twins have shown conflicting results.\nWe investigated perinatal outcome and hospital admission during the first 3 years of life for all twin children born in Western Australia between 1994 and 2000 [700 ART, 4097 SC].\nART twins had a greater risk of adverse perinatal outcome including preterm birth, low birthweight and death compared with SC twins of unlike-sex. In their first year of life, ART twins had a longer birth admission; were 60% more likely to be admitted to a NICU; and had a higher risk of hospital admission. The increased risk of hospital admission continued in the second and third year but was not statistically significant in the third year.\nCouples undertaking ART should be aware that in addition to the known increased perinatal risks associated with a twin birth, ART twins are more likely than SC twins to be admitted to a NICU and hospitalized in the first 3 years of life.",

The OCSS phenotype was defined using standard diagnostic criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder, though regardless of impairment.\nIn the bivariate model, correlation between the CRI defined phenotype and the OCSS phenotype was estimated to be .40 (95% CI .27-.50), and this correlation was attributable wholly to additive genetic effects. The bivariate model also provided estimates of heritability of the two phenotypes separately: 55% (95% CI 80-89%) for the OCSS phenotype, with the remaining variance attributable mainly to non-shared environment, and 50% (95% CI 39-62%) for CRI assessed normative repetitive routines of childhood, with 36% of the remaining variance attributable to shared environment and 14% to non-shared.\nThe moderate correlation between normative childhood repetitive routines and obsessive compulsive symptomatology, attributable to genetic factors, is consistent with the hypothesis that high levels of this trait in young children constitute a risk factor for the development of obsessive compulsive symptoms.",

    "abstract": "In twin studies of cardiovascular disease biomarkers the dizygotic correlations are often estimated to be less than half of monozygotic correlations indicating a potential influence of nonadditive genetic factors. Using a large and homogenous sample, we estimated the additive and dominance genetic influences on levels of high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, hemoglobin Alc and c-reactive protein, all of which are biomarkers associated with cardiovascular disease. The blood biomarkers were measured on 12,000 Swedish twins born between 1911 and 1958. The large sample allowed us to obtain heritability estimates with considerable precision and provided adequate statistical power for estimation of dominance genetic components. Our study showed complete absence of the shared environment component for the investigated traits. Dominant genetic component was shown to be significant for low density lipoprotein (0.18), glucose (0.31), Hemoglobin Alc (0.55), and c-reactive protein (0.27). To our knowledge, this is the first statistically significant evidence for dominance genetic variance found for low density lipoprotein, glucose, hemoglobin Alc, and c-reactive protein in a population based twin sample. The study highlights the importance of acknowledging nonadditive genes underlying the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.",

Both twins received KC while their vital signs and maternal breast temperatures were manually recorded every 30 seconds. Descriptive statistics were computed.\nIdentical twins, born to a 19-year-old African-American primigravada, were 34 3/7 weeks postconceptional age with weights of 1,760 and 1,480 g, respectively, when tested. Preterm labor resulted in spontaneous vaginal birth at 30 weeks gestation.\nInfant heart and respiratory rates, oxygen saturations, abdominal temperatures, and maternal breast temperatures.\nInfant A's vital signs exceeded acceptable clinical limits during shared KC; vital signs returned to normal range once Infant A was returned to the incubator. Infant B's vital signs approximated clinically acceptable ranges throughout the session. Breast temperatures did not differ. Individuality mandates vigilant assessment of infant responses to shared KC.",

    "abstract": "A pair of 2-year-old female monozygotic twins presented with short and brittle hair. There was marked reduction in hair density, and excessive curving of the eyelashes. Onychodystrophy was also evident. They also had developmental delay in verbal and motor skills. Neither their parents nor other relatives were known to be affected, and there was no history of consanguinity. Examination of the hair shaft under light microscopy showed trichoschisis, which was more evident under electron microscopy. Under polarized light, the hair shafts showed the pathognomonic 'tiger-tail' pattern. The level of sulphur in the hair was low. Both patients were negative for TTDN1 mutation. Clinical correlation was performed and the diagnosis of Sabinas syndrome was made. Sabinas syndrome is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder first described in a group of patients from a small community in north-eastern Mexico. It is diagnosable at birth, and its major symptoms include brittle hair, mental retardation and nail dysplasia. Structural hair abnormalities are seen by both light and electron microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) are applied in technical processes for the synthesis of chiral cyanohydrins. Here we describe the thorough characterization of the recently discovered R-hydroxynitrile lyase from Arabidopsis thaliana and its S-selective counterpart from Manihot esculenta (MeHNL) concerning their properties relevant for technical applications. The results are compared to available data of the structurally related S-HNL from Hevea brasiliensis (HbHNL), which is frequently applied in technical processes. Whereas substrate ranges are highly similar for all three enzymes, the stability of MeHNL with respect to higher temperature and low pH-values is superior to the other HNLs with alpha/beta-hydrolase fold. This enhanced stability is supposed to be due to the ability of MeHNL to form tetramers in solution, while HbHNL and AtHNL are dimers. The different inactivation pathways, deduced by means of circular dichroism, tryptophan fluorescence and static light scattering further support these results. Our data suggest different possibilities to stabilize MeHNL and AtHNL for technical applications: whereas the application of crude cell extracts is appropriate for MeHNL, AtHNL is stabilized by addition of polyols. In addition, the molecular reason for the inhibition of MeHNL and HbHNL by acetate could be elucidated, whereas no such inhibition was observed with AtHNL.",

    "abstract": "Both genetic factors and environmental factors are suggested to play a role in the aetiology of inhibitor development in patients with severe haemophilia A. Monozygotic twins are ideal candidates to study the influence of environmental factors. We describe a pair of 3-year-old monozygotic twin brothers with severe haemophilia A. Prenatal diagnosis confirmed the presence of an intron 22 inversion. Other patient-related factors such as birth weight, vaccinations and the duration of breastfeeding were similar. At the age of 7 months, one boy suffered from a spontaneous subdural haematoma, which needed complete correction of haemostasis with continuous infusion of a third-generation recombinant factor VIII. A persistent high-titre inhibitor with severe clinical symptoms developed, that could only be eradicated with high-dose immune tolerance induction (ITI) for 36 months in combination with rituximab therapy. His twin brother first received treatment at 9 months of age with the same FVIII product. After treatment on nine exposure days, he developed a low-titre inhibitor at the age of 14.5 months. Unlike his brother, he was tolerized without difficulties with low-dose ITI within 2 months. The discordant antibody responses were underlined by dissimilar IgG1 and IgG4 levels in their plasma. The discordant immune response to FVIII in this pair of monozygotic twin brothers seemed to be related to intensity of treatment and severity of bleeds. This confirms that these environmental factors play an additional role in the development of inhibitors.",

A clear explanation of the etiology has not been established, and the currently proposed congenital origin, as described in the literature, remains controversial. This paper presents findings from monozygotic twin sisters with bilateral sulcus vocalis; these patients had similar morphologies, vibratory characteristics, and vocal quality measurements, which support the theory of a congenital etiology.",

    "abstract": "There is significant attention to the growing elderly African American population and estimating who and how many within this population will be affected by cognitive impairment.\nThe etiology of cognitive impairment has not been well studied in African Americans and the contribution of genetic and environmental influences to cognitive impairment is not clear.\nWe calculated concordance rates and heritability for cognitive impairment in 95 same-sexed pairs of African American twins from the Carolina African American Twin Study on Aging (CAATSA). The sample had an average age of 59.6 years (SD = 8.6 years, range 50-88 years) and 60% were female. The Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) was used to assess cognitive impairment with a lower cutoff based on our previous research with African Americans.\nThirteen of the monozygotic (MZ) twins (30.2%) and 9 of the dizygotic (DZ) twins (17.3%) were cognitively impaired. The concordance rate was 72% for MZ and 45% for DZ. We found the heritability for cognitive impairment to be 54%.\nThe study findings indicate that cognitive impairment is highly heritable, suggesting that genetics may play a relatively large role in the development of cognitive impairment in African American twins.",

    "abstract": "It is assumed that attention problems (AP) are related to impaired executive functioning. We investigated the association between AP and inhibitory control and tested to what extent the association was due to genetic factors shared with IQ. Data were available from 3 independent samples of 9-, 12-, and 18-year-old twins and their siblings (1,209 participants). AP were assessed with checklists completed by multiple informants. Inhibitory control was measured with the Stroop Color Word Task (Stroop, 1935), and IQ with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Wechsler et al., 2002) or Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Wechsler, 1997). AP and inhibitory control were only correlated in the 12-year-old cohort (r = .18), but appeared non-significant after controlling for IQ. Significant correlations existed between AP and IQ in 9- and 12-year olds (r = -.26/-.34). Inhibitory control and IQ were correlated in all cohorts (r = -.16, -.24 and -.35, respectively). Genetic factors that influenced IQ also influenced inhibitory control. We conclude that the association between AP and inhibitory control as reported in the literature may largely derive from genetic factors that are shared with IQ.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) remains a mystery. Some suspected risk factors include birth rank, maternal age, sex, family history and monozygosity in twins. Various theories attempt to explain the etiology of IHPS. Scientific research suggests that enteric neuronal damage and nitric oxide synthase dysfunction may be implicated, but the consensus is that environmental modification must exist to account for the variability in its occurrence.\nFour cases of concordant occurrences of IHPS in twins were examined to determine the history and outcome of IHPS development in twins. Three sets were dizygotic and one was monozygotic. Of the eight infants, three were female, including the one monozygotic pair. In all four cases, a time lag existed between the development of symptomatic onset of IHPS in twin A and twin B. In one set, sonographic confirmation, performed because of IHPS diagnosis in the twin sibling, occurred concurrently with onset of vomiting, leading to early surgery before fluid and electrolyte imbalances developed.\nDespite the lack of agreement as to whether the cause of IHPS is genetic, environmental or both, the high concordance rate seen in twins is indisputable. Thus, the empirical evidence provides credence to consider examining the asymptomatic co-twin when one of the twins presents with IHPS.\nL\u2019\u00e9tiologie de la st\u00e9nose hypertrophique du pylore chez l\u2019enfant (SHPE) demeure un myst\u00e8re. Parmi les facteurs de risque pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s, soulignons le rang dans la famille, l\u2019\u00e2ge de la m\u00e8re, le sexe, les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents familiaux et le monozygotisme chez les jumeaux. Diverses th\u00e9ories cherchent \u00e0 expliquer l\u2019\u00e9tiologie de la SHPE. Selon les recherches scientifiques, les l\u00e9sions neuronales ent\u00e9riques et le dysfonctionnement de la synthase de monoxyde d\u2019azote pourraient \u00eatre en cause, mais on s\u2019entend pour croire en une modification environnementale qui en expliquerait la variabilit\u00e9.\nLes auteurs ont examin\u00e9 quatre cas d\u2019occurrences concomitantes de SHPE chez des jumeaux pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019historique et l\u2019issue de l\u2019\u00e9volution du SHPE chez les jumeaux. Trois couples \u00e9taient dizygotes et un, monozygote. Trois des huit nourrissons \u00e9taient de sexe f\u00e9minin, y compris le couple monozygote. Dans les quatre cas, on remarquait un d\u00e9lai entre l\u2019apparition symptomatique du SHPE chez le jumeau A et le jumeau B. Au sein d\u2019un couple, la confirmation \u00e9chographique effectu\u00e9e en raison du diagnostic de SHPE chez le jumeau a concord\u00e9 avec le d\u00e9but des vomissements et suscit\u00e9 une intervention chirurgicale rapide, avant l\u2019apparition d\u2019un d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre de liquides et d\u2019\u00e9lectrolytes.\nM\u00eame si on ne s\u2019entend pas pour d\u00e9terminer si le SHPE est attribuable \u00e0 des facteurs g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques, environnementaux ou les deux, le taux de concordance \u00e9lev\u00e9 observ\u00e9 chez les jumeaux est incontestable. De plus, les donn\u00e9es empiriques justifient l\u2019examen du jumeau asymptomatique lorsque l\u2019autre jumeau est atteint de SHPE.",

    "abstract": "Concordance of MLL-rearranged acute leukemia in infant monozygotic twins is thought to be 100% with a very short latency period, suggesting that either the MLL fusion itself is sufficient to cause leukemia or that it promotes the rapid acquisition of additional oncogenic events that result in overt disease. We report the first case of discordance in an infant monozygotic twin pair. Twin A presented at age 9 months with MLL-ENL(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia and twin B remains healthy 3 years later. The presence and eventual clearance of a clonal population of MLL-ENL(+) cells was shown in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of twin B. Clearance of this clone was temporally associated with viral-induced cytopenias, suggesting an immune-mediated clearance of the clone before the development of leukemia. Thus, concordance of MLL-rearranged acute leukemia in infant monozygotic twins is not universal. The implications of this case for MLL-rearranged leukemogenesis are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is to a large extent influenced by genetic factors, but environmental influences are considered important as well. To distinguish between functional brain changes underlying primarily genetically and environmentally mediated ADHD, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare response interference in monozygotic twins highly concordant or discordant for attention problems (AP). AP scores were assessed longitudinally with the Child Behavior Check List attention problem scale (CBCL-AP). Response interference was measured during two executive function paradigms; a color-word Stroop and a flanker task. The neuroimaging results indicated that, across the entire sample, children with high CBCL-AP scores, relative to children with low CBCL-AP scores, showed decreased activation to response interference in dorsolateral prefrontal, parietal and temporal brain regions. Increased activation was noted in the premotor cortex and regions associated with visual selective attention processing, possibly reflecting compensatory mechanisms to maintain task performance. Specific comparisons of high and low scoring concordant twin pairs suggest that AP of genetic origin was characterized by decreased activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the Stroop task and right parietal lobe during the flanker task. In contrast, comparison of twins from discordant monozygotic pairs, suggests that AP of environmental origin was characterized by decreased activation in left and right temporal lobe areas, but only during Stroop interference. The finding of distinct brain activation changes to response interference in inattention/hyperactivity of \"genetic\" versus \"environmental\" origin, indicates that genetic and environmental risk factors for attention/hyperactivity problems affect the brain in different ways.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of night eating (NE) and associated symptoms in a population-based sample of Swedish twins. A total of 21,741 individuals aged 20-47 years completed a questionnaire in 2005/2006. NE was defined as >/=25% of daily food intake after the evening meal and/or awakening at least once per week with eating episodes. The prevalence of NE was 4.6% in men and 3.4% in women. Among obese men and women, the prevalence was 8.4 and 7.5%, respectively. Men and women with NE had 3.4 and 3.6 times higher risk of binge eating compared to individuals without NE. The risk of sleep-related problems was 1.6-3.4 times higher in men and 2.5-3.3 times higher in women with NE compared to those without NE. This epidemiological study has estimated the prevalence of NE in a twin population. It revealed that NE is 2.5 and 2.8 times more common in obese men and women compared to normal weight men and women. Furthermore that NE is associated with binge eating and sleep-related problems.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of optimal delivery for twin gestations is complex due to the relatively high frequency of obstetrical complications and to the heterogeneity of delivery management in these conditions. The extern validity of the Anglo-Saxon studies is limited in particular because delivery management of the second twin (approach of external cephalic version) differs from the French one (approach of internal version and/or total breech extraction) in cases of non-vertex second twin. Anglo-Saxon studies suggest that a planned vaginal delivery is associated to an increased risk of neonatal morbidity for second twin compared to first twin at term, in particular in cases of combined vaginal-cesarean birth. To reduce the interval twin-to-twin delivery interval and the number of combined vaginal-cesarean births, in our opinion, one must stop to perform external cephalic version and recommend a routinely active management for the second non-vertex twin delivery. With this active management, there is no evidence to support planned cesarean section for twins. Nevertheless, active management requires training as internal version might be difficult to perform, and therefore it is essential to pursue to teach junior obstetrician these obstetric maneuvers. There is limited role for trial of labor after cesarean delivery in twin gestation with a policy of active management.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to improve the diagnosis of congenital heart disease in conjoined twins using echocardiography.\nSix sets of conjoined twins at Shanghai Children's Medical Center and Xin-Hua Hospital from 1980 to 2006 were assessed retrospectively. Cardiac anomalies of varying degrees of severity were first evaluated using 2D echocardiography. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) was then performed if fused ventricles were suspected. Peak systolic velocities, peak systolic strain rates, and peak systolic strains at the fused myocardium were quantitatively measured using strain rate imaging (SRI). If the M-mode echocardiographic image was poor or difficult to measure, the myocardial performance index (MPI) of the left ventricle was calculated.\nIntracardiac anomalies were diagnosed correctly using echocardiography and confirmed by surgical findings. Cardiac functional assessment using MPI demonstrated heart failure in three out of the eight individuals. Subtle conjunction of the ventricles, however, were more difficult to visualize and two sets of conjoined twins with fused hearts could not be clearly demonstrated by echocardiography. In one case of suspected ventricular wall conjunction, TDI showed separate ventricular myocardia which was confirmed at surgery.\nIntracardiac anomalies and ventricular function can be readily demonstrated by echocardiography, but subtle conjunction of the ventricles may be more difficult to visualize. TDI may be required if there is uncertainty about the degree of cardiac fusion.",

    "abstract": "Twins with Pfeiffer syndrome (or acrocephalosyndactyly) had a similar phenotypic appearance with findings of classic or type 1 Pfeiffer syndrome, including bicoronal and sagittal craniosynostoses, midface hypoplasia, and broad thumbs/toes. We document their treatment with 2 monobloc advancements and discuss growth disturbances in craniofacial dysostosis.\nAt 6 months, both twins underwent release of multisuture (bilateral coronal and sagittal) fusions for improvement of scaphocephalic shape and multisuture release; however, one twin had a more aggressive procedure with advancement of the frontal-orbital region. Despite improved initial correction by one twin, at 5 years of age, both twins presented with midface hypoplasia and exorbitism and underwent a monobloc distraction procedure with similar 20-mm advancements. Comparative analysis by our craniofacial multidisciplinary team included perioperative reports, computed tomographic scans, cephalograms, parent questionnaires, and physician surveys.\nBoth twins had an improved confidence interval scores from 84 to 68 and 82 to 69 postoperatively. In 6-month follow-up, the Whitaker score of the first twin was 2.8, whereas that for the second twin with the frontal-orbital advancement was 1.2. Preschool expressive and receptive tests yielded 97 and 95, and 97 and 98, and developmental testing was similar between the twins. Global evaluations were equivalent to age-matched controls, and memory and attention skills were within normal limits. Parental surveys showed a high level of satisfaction after all procedures in both twins.\nOur study demonstrates that the phenotypic outcome for both twins remained unchanged when comparing a more aggressive surgery to less aggressive surgery as an infant. The genetic mutation may have overridden the different surgical interventions. Both twins ultimately required 2 subsequent monobloc corrections.",

    "abstract": "We intend to verify if fetal volume and crown-rump length were different between singletons and twins in pregnancies aged from 7 to 10 weeks and to evaluate if fetal volume is more accurate to determine the gestational age than crown-rump length at this gestational age.\nFrom 52 days (7 weeks and 3 days) to 73 days (10 weeks and 3 days) weekly three-dimensional ultrasonography was performed in 20 twin fetuses and 20 singletons. Crown-rump length and fetal volume using VOCAL were assessed in all examinations. The 'true' gestational age was based on oocyte retrieval.\nAt the age of 52 days, the crown-rump length was 11.74+/-0.27 mm (mean+/-S.D.) and 11.48+/-0.22 mm (singletons and twins, respectively), while the fetal volume was 0.354+/-0.015 cm(3) and 0.324+/-0.012 cm(3). At the gestational age of 73 days, the crown-rump length was 36.19+/-0.90 mm and 35.87+/-0.54 mm and the fetal volume was 6.204+/-0.090 cm(3) and 6.083+/-0.081 cm(3). The total relative increase observed was much higher for fetal volume than for CRL: 1705+/-301% vs. 210+/-33% in singletons and 1827+/-305% vs. 214+/-25% in twins. The 95% limits of agreement (+/-2.3 days vs.+/-3.2 days, fetal volume vs. crown-rump length) and the intraclass correlation coefficients (0.989 vs. 0.978) between the \"true\" gestational age and that predicted by fetal volume were better than those predicted by crown-rump length. No significant difference was identified between singletons and twins for both fetal volume and crown-rump length.\nTwins and singletons had similar fetal volume and crown-rump length between the 7th and 10th week of gestational age. Additionally, fetal volume assessed by VOCAL was better than crown-rump length to estimate the gestational age at the evaluated period. However, the improvement was small and probably without clinical significance.\nFetal volume and crown-rump length were similar between singletons and twins. Fetal volume relative increase was higher and the predicted gestational age was better.",

    "abstract": "Modest genetic influences on frontal EEG asymmetry have been found in adults, but little is known about its genetic origins in children. Resting frontal asymmetry and alpha power were examined in 951 9-10-year-old twins. Results showed that in both males and females: (1) a modest but significant amount of variance in frontal asymmetry was accounted for by genetic factors (11-28%) with the remainder accounted for by non-shared environmental influences, and (2) alpha power were highly heritable, with 71-85% of the variance accounted for by genetic factors. Results suggest that the genetic architecture of frontal asymmetry and alpha power in late childhood are similar to that in adulthood and that the high non-shared environmental influences on frontal asymmetry may reflect environmentally influenced individual differences in the maturation of frontal cortex as well as state-dependent influences on specific measurements.",

    "abstract": "It is unclear to what extent spinal pain varies between genders and in relation to age. It was the purpose of this study to describe the self-reported prevalence of 1) pain ever and pain in the past year in each of the three spinal regions, 2) the duration of such pain over the past year, 3) pain radiating from these areas, and 4) pain in one, two or three areas. In addition, 5) to investigate if spinal pain reporting is affected by gender and 6) to see if it increases gradually with increasing age.\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2002 on 34,902 twin individuals, aged 20 to 71 years, representative of the general Danish population. Identical questions on pain were asked for the lumbar, thoracic and cervical regions.\nLow back pain was most common, followed by neck pain with thoracic pain being least common. Pain for at least 30 days in the past year was reported by 12%, 10%, and 4%, respectively. The one-yr prevalence estimates of radiating pain were 22% (leg), 16% (arm), and 5% (chest). Pain in one area only last year was reported by 20%, followed by two (13%) and three areas (8%).Women were always more likely to report pain and they were also more likely to have had pain for longer periods. Lumbar and cervical pain peaked somewhat around the middle years but the curves were flatter for thoracic pain. Similar patterns were noted for radiating pain. Older people did not have pain in a larger number of areas but their pain lasted longer.\nPain reported for and from the lumbar and cervical spines was found to be relatively common whereas pain in the thoracic spine and pain radiating into the chest was much less common. Women were, generally, more likely to report pain than men. The prevalence estimates changed surprisingly little over age and were certainly not more common in the oldest groups, although the pain was reported as more long-lasting in the older group.",

    "abstract": "Classical twin studies in the field of psychiatry generally fall into one of two categories: (1) those designed to identify environmental risk factors causing discordance in monozygotic (MZ) twins and (2) those geared towards identifying genetic risk factors. However, neither environment nor differences in DNA sequence can fully account for phenotypic discordance among MZ twins. The field of epigenetics--DNA modifications that can affect gene expression--offers new models to understand discordance in MZ twins. In the past, MZ twins were regarded as genetically-identical controls for differing environmental conditions. In contrast, the evolving current concept is that epigenetic differences between MZ twins may modulate differences in diverse phenotype, from disease to personality. In this article, we review some twin studies, and discuss the dynamic interactions between stochastic, environmental, and epigenetic variables that influence neurobiological phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to explore the genetic and environmental contributions to autistic-like behaviors in a general population sample of toddlers. In a classic twin study of 313 same-sex, 2-year-old twin pairs, autistic-like behaviors were assessed via parent ratings on the pervasive developmental problems subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist and observationally using tester ratings on the orientation/engagement subscale of the Behavior Rating Scale. Analyses show moderate, significant heritabilities for both measures of autistic-like behaviors, as well as modest, but significant shared environmental effects. These genetic and environmental influences overlap greatly between the two measures. Autistic-like behaviors in 2-year-old twins are largely genetic in etiology, but are also influenced by a shared environmental component at this age. This is the first study to examine the etiology of such behaviors in a sample of toddlers, thus providing novel information which could guide future research on genetic and environmental factors that affect these behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetric cell division is a mechanism for generating cell diversity as well as maintaining stem cell homeostasis in both Drosophila and mammals. In Drosophila, larval neuroblasts are stem cell-like progenitors that divide asymmetrically to generate neurons of the adult brain. Mitotic neuroblasts localize atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) to their apical cortex. Cortical aPKC excludes cortical localization of Miranda and its cargo proteins Prospero and Brain tumor, resulting in their partitioning into the differentiating, smaller ganglion mother cell (GMC) where they are required for neuronal differentiation. In addition to aPKC, the kinases Aurora-A and Polo also regulate neuroblast self-renewal, but the phosphatases involved in neuroblast self-renewal have not been identified. Here we report that aPKC is in a protein complex in vivo with Twins, a Drosophila B-type protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) subunit, and that Twins and the catalytic subunit of PP2A, called Microtubule star (Mts), are detected in larval neuroblasts. Both Twins and Mts are required to exclude aPKC from the basal neuroblast cortex: twins mutant brains, twins mutant single neuroblast mutant clones, or mts dominant negative single neuroblast clones all show ectopic basal cortical localization of aPKC. Consistent with ectopic basal aPKC is the appearance of supernumerary neuroblasts in twins mutant brains or twins mutant clones. We conclude that Twins/PP2A is required to maintain aPKC at the apical cortex of mitotic neuroblasts, keeping it out of the differentiating GMC, and thereby maintaining neuroblast homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins (MZ) are rarely absolutely \"identical.\" This review discusses the types of genetic/epigenetic and prenatal environmental post-zygotic mechanisms that cause discordance within such twin pairs. Some of these mechanisms--ranging from heterokaryotypia to skewed X-chromosome inactivation--may cause extreme discordance, but these extremes are merely the more emphatic examples of discordance that, to some degree, underlies the majority of MZ twin pairs. Because of the entrenched misconception that MZ twins are necessarily identical, many MZ twin pairs are mistakenly designated as dizygotic (DZ). Clinical benefits to accurate zygosity determination include correct solid organ transplantation matching, if one twin requires donation for a non-genetically mediated disease; the opportunity of preventive management for disorders that do not manifest synchronously; and better counseling to parents regarding their individually unique, and often psychologically puzzling, twin offspring. In twin pairs with complex and confusing biological origins, more detailed zygosity testing may be required. For example, intermediate trigametic and tetragametic chimeric dizygotic twins are reviewed, some of whom are, nevertheless, monochorionic (MC). Because of inter-fetal vascular anastomoses in MC twins, genetic results from blood samples may not accurately reflect discordance in solid organs. Previously, it was thought that MZ twinning was some sort of embryological fluke. However, familial monozygotic twinning is more common than suggested by the literature. Seven new families are presented in an accompanying paper. Despite the difficulties and dangers of twin pregnancy (especially so for MC twins), human twinning persists, and continues to both challenge and fascinate parents, clinicians and geneticists.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to analyze the frequency and certain epidemiological characteristics of a consecutive series of conjoined twins born in Spain.\nWe used data from the Spanish Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations for the period April 1976 to 2006. Because the Spanish law permitting voluntary termination of pregnancies (TOP) when the fetus presented malformations was effective by the end of 1985, we analyzed the data in 4 periods, 2 before 1986 and 2 after. During the first period (1976-1979) only live births were recorded, whereas both still and live births were included in the other three (1980-1985, 1986-1995, and 1996-2006). In the present study, the cases were classified as symmetrical (16 pairs) and asymmetrical (1 pair) conjoined twins. Each pair of conjoined twins was considered as only one case for calculations, regardless of the type of union.\nAmong a total of 2,281,604 consecutive births between 1980 and 2006, there were a total of 15 cases of symmetrical conjoined twins giving a frequency of 0.70 per 100,000 (1/152,107), whereas there was only 1 stillborn asymmetrical conjoined twin pair (0.04/100,000). Among the 13,418 consecutive stillborns surveyed, 6 cases of conjoined twins were identified (either symmetrical or asymmetrical) giving a frequency of 44.72 per 100,000, and 11 pairs were identified among the 2,425,583 total live births surveyed during the first period 1976 to 1979, a frequency of 0.45 per 100,000. Thus, the frequency among stillborn infants is 99.34 times higher than that observed among live births. However, the frequency for the total births (3 last periods) showed a decreasing trend from 1.47 per 100,000 birth in the first period (1980-1985) when TOP was illegal, to a value of 0.09 per 100,000 in the last period, more than 16-fold lower, probably because of the TOP of affected fetuses. Therefore, we consider that the frequencies observed in the period 1980 to 1985 are the basal values in our population. The most frequent type observed was thoracopagus, with an overall prevalence at birth of 0.44 per 100,000 (1/228,160) from 1980 to 2006, representing 58.82% of the total population of symmetric conjoined twin pairs. Diprosopus pairs were the next most common group (11.76%). Most of the cases were females (4 males/11 females), and although this appeared to be mainly because of the thoracopagus pairs (males-females, 2:8), in such a small number of cases, it is not possible to determine the ratios for the other groups. Gestational age was significantly shorter than in control twins for each type studied.\nWe conclude that it is incorrect to consider that all types of conjoined twins have the same epidemiological characteristics, such as the frequency at birth. The differences observed may be related with the distinct embryo-fetal mortality of each type of conjoined twins in different populations, and the sex ratio, among others.",

    "results": "Among a total of 2,281,604 consecutive births between 1980 and 2006, there were a total of 15 cases of symmetrical conjoined twins giving a frequency of 0.70 per 100,000 (1/152,107), whereas there was only 1 stillborn asymmetrical conjoined twin pair (0.04/100,000). Among the 13,418 consecutive stillborns surveyed, 6 cases of conjoined twins were identified (either symmetrical or asymmetrical) giving a frequency of 44.72 per 100,000, and 11 pairs were identified among the 2,425,583 total live births surveyed during the first period 1976 to 1979, a frequency of 0.45 per 100,000. Thus, the frequency among stillborn infants is 99.34 times higher than that observed among live births. However, the frequency for the total births (3 last periods) showed a decreasing trend from 1.47 per 100,000 birth in the first period (1980-1985) when TOP was illegal, to a value of 0.09 per 100,000 in the last period, more than 16-fold lower, probably because of the TOP of affected fetuses. Therefore, we consider that the frequencies observed in the period 1980 to 1985 are the basal values in our population. The most frequent type observed was thoracopagus, with an overall prevalence at birth of 0.44 per 100,000 (1/228,160) from 1980 to 2006, representing 58.82% of the total population of symmetric conjoined twin pairs. Diprosopus pairs were the next most common group (11.76%). Most of the cases were females (4 males/11 females), and although this appeared to be mainly because of the thoracopagus pairs (males-females, 2:8), in such a small number of cases, it is not possible to determine the ratios for the other groups. Gestational age was significantly shorter than in control twins for each type studied.",

We used a classical twin design with a sample of 704 adult female twins (334 monozygotic and 370 dizygotic). A gene-environment interaction (G x E) model was applied to estimate the moderating effects of childbearing. Results show that age and number of children exert a significant positive main effect on BMI. Furthermore, we found significant moderating effects of childbearing, with a larger number of children associated with an increased sensitivity to environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Melanoma runs within families, but this may be due to either shared genetic or shared environmental influences within those families. The concordance between pairs of non-identical twins compared to that between identical twins can be used to determine whether familial aggregation is due to genetic or environmental factors. Mandatory reporting of melanoma cases in the state of Queensland yielded approximately 12,000 cases between 1982 and 1990. Twins in this study and from the adjacent state of New South Wales (125 pairs in total) were used to partition variation in liability to melanoma into genetic and environmental factors. Identical twins were more concordant for melanoma (4 of 27 pairs) than non-identical twins (3 of 98 pairs; P-value approximately 0.04). Identical co-twins of affected individuals were 9.8 times more likely to be affected than by chance. However, non-identical co-twins of affected individuals were only 1.8 times more likely to be affected than by chance. An MZ:DZ recurrence risk ratio of 5.6 suggests that some of the genetic influences on melanoma are due to epistatic (gene-gene) interactions. Using these data and population prevalences, it was estimated that 55% of the variation in liability to melanoma is due to genetic influences.",

    "abstract": "This work presents two cases of codeine intoxication in 3-year-old monozygotic twin brothers while treated with a codeine slow-release formulation. One child had to be admitted to the hospital, whereas the other one died at home after aspiration of gastric content. The concentrations of codeine and major metabolites including morphine and corresponding glucuronide conjugates were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain tissue, respectively. A genetic polymorphism study was carried out in order to determine the ability of the children to metabolize codeine by O-demethylation. A pharmacokinetic calculation was also performed to estimate the administered dose of codeine in question. High concentrations of all substances were found in samples of both children. The pharmacokinetic estimate suggests an overdose of codeine, and the possible reasons for the high opiate concentrations are discussed. Furthermore, the postmortem distribution--during and after resuscitation--might play a major role in the interpretation of postmortem concentration levels.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify the environmental factors that contribute to facial aging in identical twins.\nDuring the Twins Day Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, 186 pairs of identical twins completed a comprehensive questionnaire, and digital images were obtained. A panel reviewed the images independently and recorded the differences in the perceived twins' ages and their facial features. The perceived age differences were then correlated with multiple factors.\nFour-point higher body mass index was associated with an older appearance in twins younger than age 40 but resulted in a younger appearance after age 40 (p = 0.0001). Eight-point higher body mass index was associated with an older appearance in twins younger than age 55 but was associated with a younger appearance after age 55 (p = 0.0001). The longer the twins smoked, the older they appeared (p < 0.0001). Increased sun exposure was associated with an older appearance and accelerated with age (p = 0.015), as was a history of outdoor activities and lack of sunscreen use. Twins who used hormone replacement had a younger appearance (p = 0.002). Facial rhytids were more evident in twins with a history of skin cancer (p = 0.05) and in those who smoked (p = 0.005). Dark and patchy skin discoloration was less prevalent in twins with a higher body mass index (p = 0.01) and more common in twins with a history of smoking (p = 0.005) and those with sun exposure (p = 0.005). Hair quantity was better with a higher body mass index (p = 0.01) although worse with a history of skin cancer (p = 0.005) and better with the use of hormones (p = 0.05).\nThis study offers strong statistical evidence to support the role of some of the known factors that govern facial aging.",

    "abstract": "Genetic susceptibility, low birth weight (LBW), and aging are key etiological factors in the development of type 2 diabetes. LBW is common among twins. It is unknown whether twin status per se is associated with risk of type 2 diabetes, and valid concordance rates of type 2 diabetes in twins on a lifetime perspective are lacking.\nA clinical study was done on a population-based cohort of same-sex elderly monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins (n = 297) and singleton control subjects (C) (n = 71) including measures of anthropometry and glucose tolerance. In addition, type 2 diabetes incidence cases in twins (n = 626) and singletons (n = 553) were identified through the National Diabetes Register.\nTwins were more abdominally obese, insulin resistant, and glucose intolerant, as evidenced by a higher A1C (%) (means +/- SD) (MZ: 6.0 +/- 1.0, DZ: 5.8 +/- 0.7, C: 5.6 +/- 0.3, P = 0.004) and 120-min post-oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose levels (in mmol/l) (MZ: 8.6 +/- 4.6, DZ: 8.4 +/- 3.9, C: 6.8 +/- 2.4, P = 0.003) compared with singletons. Importantly, twins had a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes (MZ: 17.5% [95% CI 14.4-20.6], DZ: 15.7% [13.1-18.3], C: 5.6% [3.0-8.2], P = 0.03) together with a 60% higher incidence rate of type 2 diabetes compared with singletons. Cumulative concordance rates of type 2 diabetes to the age of 84 years were similar among elderly MZ (0.76 [0.68-0.84]) and DZ (0.71 [0.63-0.78]) twins.\nTwin status per se is associated with abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, and increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes in elderly twins. The data support a quantitatively significant impact of the fetal environment as opposed to genetics on risk of type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Current ultrasound techniques can accurately determine the chorionicity of twins, but not zygosity. We previously proposed that the zygosity of spontaneously conceived twins can be determined at early ultrasound, where 2 corpora lutea infers dizygosity, and 1 implies monozygosity. Here we did a case series, comparing zygosity predicted using this method with definitive DNA genotyping of twins after birth. We retrospectively identified 14 ultrasound reports of spontaneous twin pregnancies at 6(+0 days) to 13+6 weeks' gestation, where both ovaries were seen and the number of corpora lutea documented. We visited all twin pairs, obtained buccal smears, and determined zygosity by genotyping 9 independent microsatellite markers. All 8 cases where 2 corpora lutea were seen were dizygotic pregnancies. One further case where 3 corpora lutea were seen was also dizygotic. All 3 sets of monozygotic twins had 1 corpus luteum. There were 2 cases incorrectly assigned, where 1 corpus luteum was seen in dizygotic pregnancies. We conclude if 2 corpora lutea are seen at a first trimester ultrasound of spontaneously conceived dichorionic twins, they appear to be almost certainly dizygotic. However, if 1 corpus luteum is seen in dichorionic twins, zygosity cannot be determined with certainty since it is either monozygotic, or dizygotic where a second corpus luteum has been missed.",

    "abstract": "Maternal infection with parvovirus B19 during pregnancy can cause aplastic anemia in the fetus and may lead to nonimmune fetal hydrops and fetal demise. Twin pregnancies complicated by infection due to parvovirus B19 are very rare clinical events. We present a dichorionic, diamniotic, dizygotic twin pregnancy after in vitro fertilization with parvovirus B19 infection and viral transmission to both twins, but different outcomes. At 19 weeks gestation, hydrops fetalis was diagnosed for male twin A, female twin B did not show any abnormalities. At 22 weeks gestation an acute parvovirus B19 infection was detected and twin A was diagnosed with intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) by ultrasound at 23 weeks gestation. Viral DNA was detected in maternal blood as well as in placenta and liver tissue of this twin. Twin B was born at 35 weeks gestation asymptomatically and no signs of hydrops or other congenital anomalies but viral DNA was detected by PCR in serum. At the age of 2 years, both IgG titres against B19 and parvovirus DNA amplification copies were still positive in plasma of the surviving twin, but no clinical signs were detectable. It is remarkable that both twins were infected with parvovirus B19 early in pregnancy but showed a discordant clinical outcome. Our case report describes the rare occurrence of an intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) of one twin and the asymptomatic infection of the other in a twin pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "A growing literature suggests that personality traits may be endophenotype markers for psychiatric illnesses. Although the phenotypic relationships between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and high neuroticism and low extraversion have been well documented, underlying genetic and environmental contributions to these associations have not been explored previously. Five hundred and twenty-four monozygoitc (MZ) and 228 dizygotic (DZ) pairs of adolescent and young adult twins (aged 13-24 years) drawn from the South Korean Twin Registry completed the Maudsley Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (MOCI) and the Neuroticism and Extraversion scale of the Eysenck Personality Scale by mail. The total score of MOCI (MOCIT) was significantly and positively correlated with Neuroticism (r = .44), but only weakly and negatively related to Extraversion (r = -.10). A trivariate Cholesky model was applied to the data. The additive genetic correlations in the best-fitting model were .51 between Neuroticism and MOCIT and -.17 between Extraversion and MOCIT, suggesting that additive genetic factors that lead to high neuroticism and low extraversion overlap with those genetic factors influencing high OC symptoms. These findings add to the cumulative evidence of the shared genetic etiology for the associations between a personality profile of high neuroticism and low extraversion and mental illnesses.",

Coffee consumption and coffee preference was explored in a sample of 4,495 twins (including 1,231 pairs) registered with the Netherlands Twin Registry. Twin resemblance was assessed by tetrachoric correlations and the influence of both genetic and environmental factors was explored with model fitting analysis in MX. Results showed moderate genetic influences (39%) on coffee consumption. The remaining variance was explained by shared environmental factors (21%) and unique environmental factors (40%). The variance in coffee preference (defined as the proportion of coffee consumption relative to the consumption of coffee and tea in total) was explained by genetic factors (62%) and unique environmental factors (38%).",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twin (MZT) epigenetic development, i.e., aging, diverges largely in time despite the initially very small genetic differences between MZTs. This fact is interpreted as a \"sensitivity to initial conditions\" phenomenon, a common property of either deterministic or stochastic chaotic systems. Some of the biotheoretical implications stemming from this empirical observation are briefly discussed here, while an actual measure of MZT epigenetic time divergence is given through an estimate of the (Stochastic) Lyapunov exponents (LEs) (i.e., the rate of exponential time divergence). These results suggest a reconsideration of the Langevin-Einstein thought experiment known as the \"twin paradox.\" At least four twins are necessary in order to take into account the inertially independent divergent aging described here. Alternatively, LE estimates, like those given here, should be used. Finally suggested in the actual special-relativity experiments is the replacement of clocks with some nonlinear (chaotic) forced oscillator.",

    "abstract": "Separating ischiopagus conjoined twins presents the challenge of closing complex pelvic and abdominal wall defects. Traditionally, synthetic mesh has been used to reconstruct large body wall defects. Recent studies demonstrate increased complications while using synthetic mesh for complex musculofasciocutaneous defects. Acellular dermis is a bioprosthetic material that offers advantages over synthetic mesh. These include the ability to become revascularized and remodeled with host tissue, thereby increasing resistance to infection, providing tolerance to overlying skin breakdown, and augmenting strength. The authors describe the use of acellular dermis to reconstruct the pelvic and abdominal walls in the separation of 4-year-old female ischiopagus tripus conjoined twins. Acellular dermis has proven to be effective, as 18 months postoperatively there is no evidence of ventral herniation, wall weakness, or infection. Acellular dermis is a valuable and effective alternative to synthetic mesh for reconstructing large pelvic and abdominal wall defects.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the genetic contribution to individual differences in neural networks subserving cognition function. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) twin study, we found a significant genetic influence on brain activation in neural networks supporting digit working memory tasks. Participants activating frontal-parietal networks responded faster than individuals relying more on language-related brain networks. There were genetic influences on brain activation in language-relevant brain circuits that were atypical for numerical working memory tasks as such. This suggests that differences in cognition might be related to brain activation patterns that differ qualitatively among individuals.",

    "abstract": "To determine the effect of very low birth weight (VLBW; <1500 g) and moderately low birth weight (MLBW; 1500-2499 g) on children's mental and motor development and physical growth during the first 2 years of life and whether VLBW and MLBW babies catch up to normal birth weight (NBW; > or =2500 g) children by age 2.\nWe use data on dizygotic (DZ) and monozygotic (MZ) twins and singleton births from the first two waves of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), a nationally representative dataset of children born in the US in 2001. We estimate the effects of VLBW and MLBW on children's mental and motor development scores, weight-for-age, weight-for-length, weight-for-height, and length-for-age z-scores at 9 months and 2 years. We examine whether differences in outcomes within twin pairs are related to differences in their birth weights. The within-twins analysis is conducted on samples of DZ and MZ twins. For comparison, we also estimate birth weight effects on child outcomes from multivariate linear regression models using the full singleton and twins' sample. We also estimate the effect of being small-for-gestational age (SGA; birth weight <10th percentile for gestation) using the same set of models in order to separate out the effects of fetal growth restriction from prematurity.\nEvaluation of all births showed that VLBW and MLBW have large negative effects on mental development, motor development, and growth at 9 months and 2 years of age. However, results from within-twin models with DZ twins that control for shared maternal and environmental factors showed much less effect of birth weight on mental or motor development, but continued large effects on growth for the VLBW group. Within-twin models with MZ twins that control for shared maternal, environmental, and genetic factors showed statistically insignificant effects of birth weight on mental and motor development, but continued effects on growth. Similar patterns were found when examining the effects of SGA.\nAfter controlling for the influence of maternal, environmental, and genetic factors, low birth weight has at most a small negative effect on children's mental and motor development in their first 2 years of life. However, low birth weight is a major risk factor for children's physical growth in the early years and there is no evidence of catch-up by age 2.",

    "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the functional disruption of the copper-transporting protein adenosine triphosphatase 7B (ATP-ase 7B). The disease is caused by mutations in ATP7B gene. It seems that the type of mutation in ATP7B only to some degree determines phenotypic manifestation of WD. We examined two pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for WD phenotype. The first set of twins were ATP7B compound heterozygotes c.3207C>A (p.H1069Q)/c.1211_1212insA (p.N404Kfs). The index case developed severe liver failure followed by depressive symptoms, dysarthria, and tremor at the age of 36. Her sister remained presymptomatic at diagnosis at the age of 39. The second twins were ATP7B c.3207C.A (p.H1069Q) homozygotes. The index case presented with dysarthria and tremor at the age of 26. Her sister remained clinically presymptomatic at diagnosis at the age of 28. We concluded that the phenotypic characteristics of WD are possibly attributable to epigenetic/environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the heritability of serum alanine aminotransferase (S-ALT) and fasting serum insulin (fS-insulin) concentration as well as determine the association of these measures with liver fat content in young adult monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins.\nThree hundred and thirteen individual twins were recruited from a population-based cohort (n = 4929). The study subjects represented a wide range of body mass indexes (BMI), were free of any diseases or regular medications and had an intake of less than two drinks of alcohol/day. To verify that S-ALT is a marker of liver fat, it was measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) in 66 subjects. Heritability estimations were performed using BMI- and gender-adjusted values.\nIntra-pair correlations were significantly higher in the MZ twins than the DZ twins for both S-ALT (0.65 for MZ and 0.04 for DZ) and fS-insulin (0.58 and 0.34, respectively). Heritability of S-ALT was 55% and that of fS-insulin 61%. In the 66 subjects S-ALT (r = 0.70 for women and r = 0.50 for men, p < or = 0.01 for both) and fS-insulin (r = 0.58 and r = 0.59, respectively, p < or = 0.01 for both) concentrations correlated significantly with liver fat content.\nThese twin data suggest that approximately 60% of the variation in S-ALT, a marker of liver fat content, is genetically determined.",

Three infants had left pulmonary artery (LPA) sling and one intra-cardiac malformation. Slide tracheoplasty was done under cardiopulmonary bypass, and cardiovascular malformations were corrected at the same time. One child needed plication of paralyzed right hemi-diaphragm and another distal tracheal Palmaz stent insertion due severe tracheobronchomalacia. All children are doing well during 6 months follow-up. Slide tracheoplasty seems to produce the same good early results in twins as for singletons with LSCTS.",

The sisters showed similar slowly progressive clinical symptoms and deterioration, however the younger sister also demonstrated intractable myoclonus in the right leg. The serial MR images and (1)H-MR spectroscopy of the brain were obtained in both twins. MR images showed high intensity on T (2)-weighted image in the bilateral white matter, however there were no signal changes in the basal ganglia and thalamus during any of the phases. The ratio of N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) was decreased in the both white matter lesions and the corpus striatum, and that of myoinositol (mI)/Cr was increased in the damaged white matter on MR spectroscopy. The elevation of the lactate peak was clearly demonstrated in the left basal ganglia of the younger sister; however it was not shown in cerebral lesions of the elder sister. Changes in metabolites on MR spectroscopy were closely linked to the respective clinical features of each twin. Follow-up examination by (1)H-MR spectroscopy is useful for the evaluation of neuronal changes in children with Tay-Sachs disease.",

    "abstract": "Apart from a series of 10 acephalus/acardius (Ac/Ac) cases described from a pathological point of view, and the analysis of a review of published cases, we have been unable to find any epidemiological studies on Ac/Ac. Using data from the Spanish Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations (ECEMC), we present here what seems to be the first epidemiological analysis of a consecutive series of the Ac/Ac type of monozygotic twins (MZT). Among a total of 2,281,604 consecutive births, 11 cases of Ac/Ac MZT were detected, giving a frequency of 0.48 per 100,000 births. However, we consider the period 1980-1985 as the baseline for our data, as in this period voluntary termination of pregnancy was not possible in Spain, and the frequency of Ac/Ac MZT was 0.49 per 100,000 births. Nonetheless, this frequency should be considered as a minimal estimation. The characteristics of these Ac/Ac cases indicate that they are more frequent in males (sex ratio 2.67). In addition, gestational age in Ac/Ac cases was 2.41 and 3.12 weeks lower than in malformed and control twins, respectively. Similarly, their mothers are 4.54 and 4.68 years younger than mothers of separate malformed and control twins, respectively. To understand the biological basis behind the occurrence of MZT in the context of recent observations, we evaluate the hypothesis that the epigenetic processes involved in the early cleavage of the embryo, and in blastocyst formation during development, may be implicated in twinning.",

    "abstract": "Discordant expression of Familial Amyloid Neuropathy (FAP) in monozygotic twins is a rare event. Only five such cases have been described in the literature so far. We report the clinical, neurophysiologic and autonomic findings of Brazilian monozygotic twins discordant for the expression of FAP type I. Twin I first presented symptoms at the age of 21, when his brother was completely asymptomatic. Twin 2 only presented symptoms at the age of 25, almost four years after his brother. Both brothers eventually developed the complete phenotype of FAP type I. The occurrence of monozygotic twins discordant for the expression of FAP type I suggests that other factors beside TTR gene mutations should play an important role in the pathogenesis of this condition. Environmental factors, as well as modifier genetic loci are likely to modulate the expression of FAP type I and the study of cases such as the one presented here may help to identify some of these factors.",

    "abstract": "Demography is the statistical study of populations, epidemiology of health of populations. Fascinating challenges for future research, shared by epidemiology and demography, are to be found in the human life course, how the life course is transmitted over generations, how the healthy life is shaped by dynamics within the life course and how the life course is affected by the social and economic environment. The life course begins when two future parents meet. Then social disadvantage or privilege is beginning and diverse rates of ageing are being fixed. Health in utero and at young age will co-determine health at middle and old age, among others mediated by a greater intelligence and a better education. Particularly better education compresses cognitive disability at the end of life, building cognitive reserves that increase brain plasticity and enhance resistance to damage. While with extended life spans may come extended life spans with disability, the twin demography and epidemiology may show how to lighten the burden of senescence at the end of life.",

She underwent standard controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Retrieved oocytes were fertilized in vitro, and 3 embryos were transferred on day 4 after laser-assisted hatching. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a monoamniotic twin pregnancy and a monochorionic-triamniotic triplet pregnancy. A second ultrasound, 1 week later, showed three distinct foci of cardiac motion in one sac, while the sac of the monoamniotic twins had one embryo with heart beat. After extensive counseling with perinatologists about pregnancy complications, the patient elected to performed fetal reduction on the third sac. A healthy male infant was delivered by Caesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation.\nThe exact mechanism of monozygotic multiple gestation is still poorly characterized. Procedures that modify the zona pellucida (e.g. ICSI and assisted embryo hatching) have been suggested as important in the monozygotic multiple gestation hypothesis, yet a definitive relationship between any clinical intervention during in vitro fertilization and the subsequent development of multiple monozygotic gestation remains speculative.",

    "abstract": "Impaired oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle mitochondria contribute to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Furthermore, mRNA expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, including ATP5O, is reduced in skeletal muscle from T2D patients. Our aims were to investigate mechanisms regulating ATP5O expression in skeletal muscle and association with glucose metabolism, and the relationship between ATP5O single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and risk of T2D.\nATP5O mRNA expression was analyzed in skeletal muscle from young (n = 86) and elderly (n = 68) non-diabetic twins before and after a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. 11 SNPs from the ATP5O locus were genotyped in the twins and a T2D case-control cohort (n = 1466). DNA methylation of the ATP5O promoter was analyzed in twins (n = 22) using bisulfite sequencing. The mRNA level of ATP5O in skeletal muscle was reduced in elderly compared with young twins, both during basal and insulin-stimulated conditions (p<0.0005). The degree of DNA methylation around the transcription start of ATP5O was <1% in both young and elderly twins and not associated with mRNA expression (p = 0.32). The mRNA level of ATP5O in skeletal muscle was positively related to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (regression coefficient = 6.6; p = 0.02). Furthermore, two SNPs were associated with both ATP5O mRNA expression (rs12482697: T/T versus T/G; p = 0.02 and rs11088262: A/A versus A/G; p = 0.004) and glucose uptake (rs11088262: A/A versus A/G; p = 0.002 and rs12482697: T/T versus T/G; p = 0.005) in the young twins. However, we could not detect any genetic association with T2D.\nGenetic variation and age are associated with skeletal muscle ATP5O mRNA expression and glucose disposal rate, suggesting that combinations of genetic and non-genetic factors may cause the reduced expression of ATP5O in T2D muscle.

    "abstract": "Common knowledge of over a century has it that monozygotic and dizygotic twinning events occur by unrelated mechanisms: monozygotic twinning 'splits' embryos, producing anomalously re-arranged embryogenic asymmetries; dizygotic twinning begins with independent ovulations yielding undisturbed parallel embryogeneses with no expectation of departures from singleton outcomes. The anomalies statistically associated with twin births are due to the re-arranged embryos of the monozygotics. Common knowledge further requires that dizygotic pairs are dichorionic; monochorionicity is exclusive to monozygotic pairs. These are fundamental certainties in the literature of twin biology. Multiple observations contradict those common knowledge understandings. The double ovulation hypothesis of dizygotic twinning is untenable. Girl-boy twins differ subtly from all other humans of either sex, absolutely not representative of all dizygotics. Embryogenesis of dizygotic twins differs from singleton development at least as much as monozygotic embryogenesis does, and in the same ways, and the differences between singletons and twins of both zygosities represent a coherent system of re-arranged embryogenic asymmetries. Dizygotic twinning and monozygotic twinning have the same list of consequences of anomalous embryogenesis. Those include an unignorable fraction of dizygotic pairs that are in fact monochorionic, plus many more sharing co-twins' cells in tissues other than a common chorion. The idea that monozygotic and dizygotic twinning events arise from the same embryogenic mechanism is the only plausible hypothesis that might explain all of the observations.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the risk that nulliparity poses to the outcome of twin pregnancies, an issue that gained importance due to the rise of twin gestations following assisted reproduction interventions.\nA prospective cohort study.\nBetween January 1, 2004, and January 7, 2008, we prospectively enrolled all pregnancies achieved by assisted reproduction techniques and including ovulation induction, which successfully completed the first trimester. Pregnancies achieved by egg donation were excluded.\nSecond trimester abortion and severe prematurity (delivery before 32 weeks) rates and the number of live births.\nTwo-hundred-forty-three twin pregnancies were available for evaluation. Second trimester miscarriage rate was 9.3% in nulliparas and 2.4% in multiparas (P=0.061). Severe prematurity rate was 15.1% in nulliparas compared with 2.5% in multiparas (P=0.003). Better outcome of multiparas was also demonstrated by the calculated chance of taking home at least one baby: 97.6% for multiparas compared with 89.2% in nulliparas (P=0.024).\nNulliparity is a risk factor for a poor outcome in twin pregnancies achieved by fertility treatments and is associated with an increased risk for severe prematurity and possibly late abortions. This information should be relayed to the patients undergoing fertility treatments and is a consideration regarding the number of fetuses in relation to parity.",

    "abstract": "The genetic and environmental etiology of high math performance (at or above the 85%tile) was examined in a population-based sample of 10-year-old twins (nMZ = 1,279, nDZ = 2,305). Math skills were assessed using a web-based battery of math performance tapping skills related to the UK National Math Curriculum. Probandwise concordance rates and liability threshold models indicated that genetic and shared environmental influences were significant, and that these estimates were generally similar to those obtained across the normal range of ability and did not vary significantly by gender. These results suggest that the genetic and environmental influences at the high end of ability are likely to be continuous with those that affect the entire range of math performance across all children irrespective of gender.",

    "abstract": "The definition of a smoker as someone who smokes daily has been challenged. No consensus exists regarding whether intermittent smoking represents transition toward daily smoking or cessation or whether intermittent smokers consistently maintain their low tobacco use frequency. Although abundant evidence supports the adverse health consequences of daily smoking, less evidence is available on intermittent smoking.\nWe examined characteristics and health consequences of intermittent cigarette smoking among Finnish adult twins. We used longitudinal data of 21,340 persons with smoking status from questionnaires in 1975 and 1981 and data on lung cancer incidence from 1982 to 2004 from the Finnish Cancer Registry.\nWe identified 641 consistent intermittent smokers comprising 3% of the study population. Consistent intermittent smokers had higher education, less use of other tobacco products, healthier lifestyles, and partly more favorable mental health profiles compared with lifetime regular smokers. However, in terms of other lifestyle factors, intermittent smokers compared mostly unfavorably with never-smokers, despite being better educated. Intermittent smoking showed substantial heritability. There were 213 incident lung cancer cases among all study subjects; only one case was found among the intermittent smokers. The sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratios of lung cancer were not significantly elevated for the intermittent smokers, but they were increased more than 10-fold for all other smokers.\nAlthough the present study did not find evidence of elevated lung cancer risk among intermittent smokers, compared with never-smokers, further studies should investigate other health consequences of intermittent smoking, such as cardiovascular and nonmalignant pulmonary outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether increasing body mass index (BMI) decreases the accuracy of sonographic estimations of fetal weight in twin gestations.\nA chart review was conducted, in which 361 charts of patients with twin gestations over a 2-year period were reviewed. A total of 194 patients had sonographic examinations for fetal weight within 6 days of delivery and were included in the analysis. The difference between the sonographically estimated fetal weight was compared with the actual birth weight for each twin and stratified for the patient's BMI.\nThere was a significant increasing trend in mean absolute percent errors with increasing BMIs in both twins (P< .05). The mean absolute percent errors for twin A were 6% for patients with a BMI of less than 25 and 9% for those with a BMI of greater than 30. The mean absolute percent errors for twin B were 6.7% for patients with a BMI of less than 25 and almost 11.7% for those with a BMI of greater than 30. There was a significantly increasing trend in mean absolute differences in grams for both twins with increasing gestational age, with almost a 4-fold increase from less than 28 weeks to greater than 36 weeks in both twins (P< .05).\nIncreasing maternal obesity decreases the accuracy of sonographically determined fetal weight in twin gestations, particularly for twin B.",

Cesarean section should be reserved for larger fetuses or when the life expectancy of the fetuses is of concern.\nThe first case was that of heavily malformed fetuses of 28 weeks in preterm labor, delivered vaginally according to their parent's request, but the fusion between fetuses was torn cephalad. The second case was diagnosed and underwent cesarean section at her 29th gestational week, but her babies were lost after birth due to cardiorespiratory arrest. The third case was 34 weeks pregnant and not diagnosed until birth. Presentation of the first fetus was vertex, while the other was breech. Totally 3,700 g twins were delivered by vaginal route without any serious complication.\nSuccessful vaginal delivery of the third trimester fetuses is possible. The technique of the delivery is important.",

    "abstract": "To establish the direction and etiology of longitudinal associations between sleep problems and depression symptoms in children.\nData on twins aged 8 and 10 years were obtained. At assessments, parents completed the Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire, and twins completed the Children's Depression Inventory.\nParticipants were mainly interviewed at the Institute of Psychiatry, London.\nThree hundred twin pairs initially enrolled in the study.\nN/A.\nA genetically informative cross-lagged model examined links between sleep and depression. Sleep problems at age 8 predicted depression at age 10 (partial regression coefficient [95% confidence intervals] = 0.10 [0.01-0.18]). The converse was not found. Stability of sleep problems across time was mainly due to genes (46% of the genetic influence on sleep at 10 was due to the same genetic influence on sleep aged 8). Stability of depression was mainly due to non-shared environmental influences (19% of the nonshared environmental influence on depression at 10 was due to the same nonshared environmental influence on depression at age 8). The cross-lagged association between sleep problems at 8 and depression at 10 years was largely due to genes, although this finding was nonsignificant.\nThis study adds to our understanding of the temporal precedence of sleep problems and depression and the risks underlying their associations. There are implications regarding the value of specifying genes linked to sleep problems and potential opportunities for informing early intervention strategies in high-risk groups at key points in the progression to developing more serious problems.",

In these children, ARM is generally low with or without a fistula. The mode of inheritance of ARM and its genetic relation with Down's syndrome is not known, even if the association (ARM-Down's syndrome) seems not to be coincidental.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine changes in the contribution of genetic and environmental effects to isometric knee extensor strength and leg extensor power among 63- to 76-year-old female twins over a 3-yr follow-up. At baseline in 2000 the sample comprised 206 monozygotic (MZ) and 228 dizygotic (DZ) twin individuals, and at follow-up in 2003 the sample comprised 149 MZ and 164 DZ twin individuals. Genetic modeling showed that genetic effects explained 58% (95% CI: 46-68%) of the variance in muscle strength at baseline and 56% (95% CI: 41-68%) at follow-up, with no occasion-specific genetic effect. Nonshared environmental effects accounted for 42% (95% CI: 32-54%) of the variation at baseline and 15% (95% CI: 7-26%) at follow-up. In addition, new nonshared environmental effects explained the remaining variance, 29% (95% CI: 22-37%) of muscle strength at follow-up. For muscle power, the same genetic effects accounted for 67% (95% CI: 57-74%) of the variation at baseline and 48% (95% CI: 34-61%) at follow-up. Nonshared environmental effects in common at both measurement points explained 33% (95% CI: 25-43%) of the total variation at baseline and 11% (95% CI: 5-21%) at follow-up. The remaining variance of muscle power at follow-up was accounted for by time-specific environmental effects. Results indicated that the contribution of genetic effects to isometric muscle strength was stable, whereas for leg extensor power the proportion of genetic effects decreased during the follow-up. We observed new specific environmental effects underlying follow-up muscle strength and power, which effects could be due to the onset of new disease processes or changes in lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "Secular trends over the past several decades suggest an environmental influence on body mass index (BMI). However, twin models that incorporate a gene-environment correlation and gene x environment interaction have not been applied to elucidate specific environmental factors that affect the heritability of BMI.\nOur aim was to determine whether one putative environmental predictor of obesity, vigorous exercise, shows evidence of a gene-environment correlation or gene x environment interaction with BMI among twins.\nTwin structural equation modeling was used to examine a gene-environment correlation and a gene x environment interaction of vigorous exercise with BMI among 2710 monozygotic and 2327 dizygotic male-male twin pairs from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry -- a national registry of twin pairs who served in the military during the Vietnam War era.\nVigorous exercise significantly modified the additive genetic component of BMI, which indicated a gene x environment interaction (P < 0.001). BMI showed the greatest genetic influence among those who did not report vigorous exercise, with diminished genetic influence among those who did. Furthermore, vigorous exercise had a small but significant environmental effect on BMI (P = 0.006) -- a finding confirmed among monozygotic co-twins discordant for vigorous exercise.\nGenetic influences on BMI are lower among those who report vigorous exercise. Consistent with an emerging literature, this suggests that vigorous exercise may mitigate some of the genetic influence on obesity. Molecular genetic studies of obesity should consider incorporating measures of behavioral and demographic factors to maximize the identification of novel obesity genes.",

    "abstract": "To determine, in a population-based sample of twin pairs, if extra-intestinal symptoms (EIS) are closely associated with both irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and psychiatric disorders and whether such associations are explained on a genetic basis.\nA random sample of twins between the ages of 44 and 64 years enrolled in the Minnesota Twins Registry completed the Modified Mayo Clinic Bowel Disease Questionnaire, a questionnaire on extra-intestinal symptoms, and the Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire.\nOf the 3,048 participants (51% response rate), 371 (12.2%) fulfilled Rome II criteria for IBS; 61 (16.4%) had a psychiatric disorder compared with 7.6% (n=204) of those without IBS (P<0.001). In regression analysis both IBS and psychiatric disorders were independently associated with the number of extra-intestinal symptoms (P<0.0005). Concordance rates for high EIS score were 30.0% for monozygote (MZ) twins and 16.7% in dizygote (DZ) twins (P=0.020) and the OR for concordance remained substantially higher for MZ than DZ twins after adjustment for psychiatric disorder and presence of IBS (6.82 (95% CI 4.45-10.45) and 2.71 (95% CI 1.69-4.37)). In MZ twins discordant for IBS, EIS and IBS were significantly associated (P=0.004) and psychiatric disorder and EIS were significantly associated (P=0.001).\nExtra-intestinal symptoms are independently associated with both IBS and psychiatric disorders. There is evidence that there is a genetic basis to EIS, but the association with IBS and psychiatric disorders is not primarily explained by genetic influences.",

Women in the BT group were significantly younger, had more oocytes retrieved, and had less embryos transferred compared with the CS group. The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the BT group at 67.9% (254 of 374), compared with 37.7% (46 of 122) among the CS group. There was a significantly higher incidence of multiple gestation in the BT group compared with CS group (37.4% compared with 19.6%). The overall incidence of MZT was 1.3%, but differed with the stage of ET: the incidence of MZT was 1.57% (4 of 254) in the BT group, and 0 (0 of 46) in the CS group.\nContrary to the older published literature on MZT in BT cycles, the incidence of MZT is low. Women undergoing ART therefore should not be discouraged to undergo BT for fear of MZT, especially in light of the higher pregnancy rate and lower number of transferred embryos noted in those cycles compared with cleavage stage transfers.",

Until now, reports have been published on 15 cases of PUVs.\nWe report a new case of concordant PUVs in one set of male monochorionic twins with secondary Prune Belly Syndrome.\nThe twins were born by elective cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation to a 36-year-old mother, gravida 6, para 6. On ultrasound perfomed at 18 weeks's gestation, both fetuses showed signs of PUVs. At birth, physical examination of both revealed a secondary Prune Belly Syndrome (PBS). Postnatal renal ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of PUV. The two infants underwent transurethral resection of the valves after a cystoscopic evaluation of the urethra. Since this procedure, their voiding has been unremarkable with stable renal function and sterile urine until their discharge.\nWe have documented a rare association between VUP and PBS in two monochiorionic twins. More studies are needed to throw light on the significance of the present associated anomalies.",

Both twins (HDH, DHH) had agenesis of ten and eleven teeth (respectively), third molars excluded, consistent with oligodontia and both had four impacted primary teeth and the permanent successors of all these primary teeth were congenitally missing. The occurrence of similarly located tooth agenesis and primary impacted teeth in monozygotic twins may suggest the influence of genetic factors in their etiology. In addition, primary tooth impaction may be related to congenitally missing tooth.",

    "abstract": "Aging studies can be facilitated by refocusing from longevity phenotypes to their proxies (intermediate phenotypes). Robust selection of the intermediate phenotypes requires data on such phenotypes and life span measured in the same individuals, which is not always the case in aging studies. A promising approach is to select intermediate phenotypes using information on longevity measured in related individuals. We evaluated feasibility of this approach focusing on 32 geriatric diseases as potential intermediate phenotypes of longevity assessed in the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins. Our analyses reveal that geriatric diseases measured in some family members can predict life span in the other family members both individually and cumulatively ensuring that this approach for selection of intermediate phenotypes is feasible. The cumulative-trait approach is more promising for such studies compared with the individual-trait approach. Heritable health dimensions contributing to a decrease of life span have sex-insensitive and sex-specific components.",

    "abstract": "Using the South Korean national live birth data for the years 2003 to 2007, monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin birth rates were estimated and analyzed by maternal age, and parents of twins and those of singletons were compared in their level of education. During this period, while the MZ twin birth rate showed no change, the DZ twin birth rate increased up to 9.4 pairs per thousand births. This rate is close to five times as high as the natural DZ twinning rate in the South Korean population. The highest twinning rate occurred among mothers aged 30 to 34 years, followed by mothers aged 25 to 29. These results represented the first evidence for the downward trend in ages of mothers of twins. In each year between 2003 and 2006, percentages of parents who completed college or higher level of education were higher in the twin than in the singleton group, suggesting that the parental socioeconomic level became higher in twins than in singletons. We speculated that these demographic changes occurred because assisted reproductive technology was more easily available among parents of high socioeconomic status. In their sampling strategies, twin researchers should consider our findings of recent changes in demographic characteristics of parents of twins as well as increased DZ twin birth rates.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the probability of twins by birth year, maternal race-ethnicity, age, and parity and the influences of these demographic factors on the probability of male in twins and singletons in a large, racially diverse population. Recent publications note steep increases in twin births while the probability of male births has been reported to vary by parental race-ethnicity and age and birth order. Probability of male stratified by plurality has not been investigated in California prior to this study. Cubic spline estimates and Poisson regression techniques were employed to describe trends in twins and males using California vital statistics birth and fetal death records over the period from 1983-2003. This study includes 127,787 twin pair and 11,025,106 singleton births. The probability of twins varied by birth year, maternal race-ethnicity, age, and parity. The probability of twins increased by 10.1% from 1983-1992 and increased by 20.1% from 1993-2003, nearly doubling the previous increase. All maternal race-ethnicity groups showed increases in probability of twins with increasing maternal age. Parous women compared to nulliparous women had larger increases in the probability of twins. The probability of males in twins decreased from 1983-1992 and increased from 1993-2003; while in singletons the probability appeared unchanged. These findings show increases in the probability of twins in California from 1983-2003 and identify maternal age, race-ethnicity, and parity groups most likely to conceive twins. The cause of the increase in twins is unknown but coincides with trends towards delayed childbearing and increased use of subfertility treatments.",

    "abstract": "Studies have reported that refractive errors are associated with premature births. As twins have higher prevalence of prematurity than singletons, it is important to assess similarity of the prevalence of refractive errors in twins and singletons for proper interpretations and generalizations of the findings from twin studies. We compared refractive errors and diopter hours between 561 pairs of twins and 3757 singletons who are representative of school-age children (7-15 years) residing in an urban area of southern China. We found that the means and variances of the continuous measurement of spherical equivalent refractive error and diopter hours were not significantly different between twins and singletons. Although the prevalence of myopia was comparable between twins and singletons, that of hyperopia and astigmatism was slightly but significantly higher in twins than in singletons. These results are inconsistent with those of adult studies that showed no differences in refractive errors between twins and singletons. Given that the sample size of twins is relatively small and that this study is the first to demonstrate minor differences in refractive errors between twins and singletons, future replications are necessary to determine whether the slightly higher prevalence of refractive errors in twins than in singletons found in this study was due to a sampling error or to the developmental delay often observed in twins in childhood.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a general model of two binary variables and applies it to twin sex pairing data from 21 twin data sources to estimate the frequency of dizygotic twins. The purpose of this study is to clarify the relationship between maximum likelihood and Weinberg's differential rule zygosity estimation methods. We explore the accuracy of these zygosity estimation measures in relation to twin ascertainment methods and the probability of a male. Twin sex pairing data from 21 twin data sources representing 15 countries was collected for use in this study. Maximum likelihood estimation of the probability of dizygotic twins is applied to describe the variation in the frequency of dizygotic twin births. The differences between maximum likelihood and Weinberg's differential rule zygosity estimation methods are presented as a function of twin data ascertainment method and the probability of a male. Maximum likelihood estimation of the probability of dizygotic twins ranges from 0.083 (95% approximate CI: 0.082, 0.085) to 0.750 (95% approximate CI: 0.749, 0.752) for voluntary ascertainment data sources and from 0.374 (95% approximate CI: 0.373, 0.375) to 0.987 (95% approximate CI: 0.959, 1.016) for active ascertainment data sources. In 17 of the 21 twin data sources differences of 0.01 or less occur between maximum likelihood and Weinberg zygosity estimation methods. The Weinberg and maximum likelihood estimates are negligibly different in most applications. Using the above general maximum likelihood estimate, the probability of a dizygotic twin is subject to substantial variation that is largely a function of twin data ascertainment method.",

    "abstract": "A recent Children-of-Female-Twin design suggests that the association between maternal alcohol use disorder and offspring ADHD is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as prenatal nicotine exposure. We present here a complementary analysis using a Children-of-Male-Twin design examining the association between paternal alcoholism and offspring attention deficit hyperactivity problems (ADHP).\nChildren-of-twins design: offspring were classified into 4 groups of varying genetic and environmental risk based on father and co-twin's alcohol dependence status.\nUnivariate results are suggestive of a genetic association between paternal alcohol dependence and broadly defined offspring ADHP. Specifically, offspring of male twins with a history of DSM-III-R alcohol dependence, as well as offspring of non-alcohol dependent monozygotic twins whose co-twin was alcohol dependent, were significantly more likely to exhibit ADHP than control offspring. However, multivariate models show maternal variables independently predicting increased risk for offspring ADHP and significantly decreased support for a genetic mechanism of parent-to-child transmission.\nIn support of earlier work, maternal variables (i.e., maternal ADHD and prenatal exposure) were strongly associated with child ADHP; however, the role of paternal alcohol dependence influences was not definitive. While genetic transmission may be important, the association between paternal alcohol dependence and child ADHP is more likely to be indirect and a result of several pathways.",

    "abstract": "Few papers have attempted to address the potential of extended kinships of twins to resolve the complexities of biological and cultural inheritance in humans. Since the mid-80s these issues have largely been buried beneath the quest for specific genes that contribute to individual differences in complex traits and liability to disease. The articles of Keller et al. and Medland and Keller (current issue) revisit these issues. History will decide whether these new papers represent the final gasp of a paradigm superceded by the 'new' genetics or contain the timely seeds of new birth in the face of a 30-year genetic research program otherwise poised on the cusp of degeneration (Lakatos & Musgrave, 1970).",

    "abstract": "Peer group deviance (PGD) is linked strongly to liability to drug use, including cannabis. Our aim was to model the genetic and environmental association, including direction of causation, between PGD and cannabis use (CU).\nResults were based on 1736 to 1765 adult males from the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry with complete CU and PGD data measured retrospectively at three time-intervals between 15 and 25 years using a life-history calendar.\nAt all ages, multivariate modeling showed that familial aggregation in PGD was explained by a combination of additive genetic and shared environmental effects. Moreover, the significant PGD-CU association was best explained by a CU-->PGD causal model in which large portions of the additive genetic (50-78%) and shared environmental variance (25-73%) in PGD were explained by CU.\nUntil recently PGD was assumed to be an environmental, upstream risk factor for CU. Our data are not consistent with this hypothesis. Rather, they suggest that the liability to affiliate with deviant peers is explained more clearly by a combination of genetic and environmental factors that are indexed by CU which sits as a 'risk indicator' in the causal pathway between genetic and environmental risks and the expression of PGD. This is consistent with a process of social selection by which the genetic and environmental risks in CU largely drive the propensity to affiliate with deviant peers.",

The screen positives (N = 18), their male co-twins (N = 10) and those with lifetime minimum BMI< or =17.5 (N = 21) were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV anorexia nervosa. The incidence rate of anorexia nervosa for the presumed peak age of risk (10-24y) was 15.7 per 100,000 person-years; its lifetime prevalence was 0.24%. All probands had recovered from eating disorders, but suffered from substantial psychiatric comorbidity, which also manifested in their co-twins. Additionally, male co-twins displayed significant dissatisfaction with body musculature, a male-specific feature of body dysmorphic disorder.\nAnorexia nervosa in males in the community is more common, transient and accompanied by more substantial comorbidity than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents investigations into the ability of speaker verification technology to discriminate between identical twins. It is shown that whilst, in general, the genetic and non-genetic characteristics of voice are both of value to speaker verification capabilities, it is the latter which is highly beneficial in the separation of the speech of identical twins. It is further demonstrated that through the use of unconstrained cohort normalisation as a complementary means for the exploitation of such voice characteristics, the verification reliability can be considerably enhanced for both identical twins and unrelated speakers. Experiments were conducted using a bespoke clean-speech database consisting of utterances from 49 identical twin pairs. The paper details the problem in speaker verification posed by identical twins, discusses the experimental investigations and provides an analysis of the results.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to review literature concerning selective feticide (SF) in monochorionic pregnancies complicated with twin-twin transfusion syndrome, twin reversed arterial perfusion, severe malformation, and discordant growth. The remaining twins' outcomes were stratified for indication and surgical technique. Three hundred forty-five cases of SF were reviewed. Premature rupture of membranes was described in all the procedures and complicated 76/345 (22%) pregnancies within 4 postoperative weeks (59%) or later (41%; P = .52). Fetal demise accounted for 51/345 (15%), more frequently within 2 postoperative weeks (79%) than thereafter (21%; P = .004; odds ratio [OR], 6.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.81-20.70). Improved survival rate was achieved in surgeries after 18 weeks (89%) than earlier (69%; P = .02; OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10-0.80) without differences for indication. Survivors were 86% after radiofrequency ablation, 82% after bipolar cord coagulation, 72% after laser cord coagulation, 70% after cord ligation. In spite of favorable outcomes, the optimal surgical approach remains undetermined.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to examine, first, whether hearing acuity predicts falls and whether the potential association is explained by postural balance and, second, to examine whether shared genetic or environmental effects underlie these associations.\nHearing was measured using a clinical audiometer as a part of the Finnish Twin Study on Aging in 103 monozygotic and 114 dizygotic female twin pairs aged 63-76 years. Postural balance was indicated as a center of pressure (COP) movement in semi-tandem stance, and participants filled in a fall-calendar daily for an average of 345 days after the baseline.\nMean hearing acuity (better ear hearing threshold level at 0.5-4 kHz) was 21 dB (standard deviation [SD] 12). Means of the COP velocity moment for the best to the poorest hearing quartiles increased linearly from 40.7 mm(2)/s (SD 24.4) to 52.8 mm(2)/s (SD 32.0) (p value for the trend = .003). Altogether 199 participants reported 437 falls. Age-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for falls, with the best hearing quartile as a reference, were 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4-3.8) in the second, 4.1 (95% CI = 1.1-15.6) in the third, and 3.4 (95% CI = 1.0-11.4) in the poorest hearing quartiles. Adjustment for COP velocity moment decreased IRRs markedly. Twin analyses showed that the association between hearing acuity and postural balance was not explained by genetic factors in common for these traits.\nPeople with poor hearing acuity have a higher risk for falls, which is partially explained by their poorer postural control. Auditory information about environment may be important for safe mobility.",

The intake of calcium was unsatisfied in 48.4% of the boys and 39.0% in girls. Less than 10.0% of the subjects were satisfied with the intake of calcium in each age group while over 45.0% of the subjects in 10-13 age group were deficient in calcium. Differences between the means of BALP in different sex groups (t = 1.633, P = 0.105) and different age groups (F = 0.323, P = 0.924) were not statistically significant. Heritability analysis displayed that intra-class variation, inter-class variation, intra-class correlation coefficient were 191.54, 1462.22, 0.77 in MZ twins, and those were 491.03, 1475.57, 0.50 in DZ twins respectively with the heritability of BALP activity as 0.54.\nCalcium deficiency is commonplace in pre-puberty twins. Our data showed that the BALP activity was influenced both by genetic (54%) and environmental (46%) factors.",

    "abstract": "In the Netherlands, prenatal screening for trisomy 21 in the first trimester of pregnancy for singletons is conducted through a combined test based on maternal age, nuchal translucency measurement and maternal serum free beta-hCG and PAPP-A. In our clinic risk calculations in twins are currently based on the NT of both fetuses instead of the combined test. In this study we looked at differences in early first-trimester free beta-hCG and PAPP-A between mono- and dichorionic twins.\nA total of 202 twin pregnant women participated in the study and agreed to donate first-trimester serum for research.\nThe data of 200 twins with normal outcome were used for setting up reference values for free beta-hCG and PAPP-A. Trisomy 21 was identified in the two remaining pregnancies. The overall median weight-corrected MoM was 1.99 for free beta-hCG, and 2.14 for PAPP-A in all twins. Monochorionic twins have a significantly lower free beta-hCG weight-corrected MoM (1.53 vs 2.11; Mann-Whitney U, p=0.002) and a significantly lower PAPP-A weight-corrected MoM (1.59 vs 2.40; Mann-Whitney U, p=0.003) compared to dichorionic.\nThis study strengthened the need to make a distinction between mono- and dichorionic twins for the risk calculation in Down syndrome screening as biochemical markers are significantly lower in monochorionic than in dichorionic twins.",

    "abstract": "The existence of genetic effects on gender atypical behavior in childhood and sexual orientation in adulthood and the overlap between these effects were studied in a population-based sample of 3,261 Finnish twins aged 33-43 years. The participants completed items on recalled childhood behavior and on same-sex sexual interest and behavior, which were combined into a childhood gender atypical behavior and a sexual orientation variable, respectively. The phenotypic association between the two variables was stronger for men than for women. Quantitative genetic analyses showed that variation in both childhood gender atypical behavior and adult sexual orientation was partly due to genetics, with the rest being explained by nonshared environmental effects. Bivariate analyses suggested that substantial common genetic and modest common nonshared environmental correlations underlie the co-occurrence of the two variables. The results were discussed in light of previous research and possible implications for theories of gender role development and sexual orientation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations in the donor and the recipient in monochorionic twin pregnancies with twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and single pregnancies in order to investigate the involvement of VEGF in the pathophysiology of TTTS.\nSix twin pregnancies in 11 monochorionic twin pregnancies complicated with TTTS and 11 single control pregnancies were compared. Gestational age-matched fetal blood and placental samples were obtained at birth. Serum VEGF concentration in the umbilical vein was measured by an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay. Tissue protein expression of VEGF was determined by using immunohistochemistry. Western blot analysis and scanning densitometry were used to quantify and compare the VEGF expression in the terminal villi.\nSerum VEGF concentrations in the umbilical vein in both donors and recipients tended to be higher than those in the controls. Immunolocalization of VEGF in terminal villous placenta samples in both donors and recipients was mainly observed in the syncytiotrophoblastic layer and vascular endothelial cells with less intense staining in stromal cells. The expression of VEGF in the donor placenta increased significantly (p=0.006) compared to that in the control placenta, but the expression of VEGF in the recipients tended to be higher than in the controls.\nIntrauterine circulatory imbalance may induce changes in VEGF expression and these alterations may be involved in both donor and recipient in the pathogenesis of TTTS, due to the maintenance of hemodynamic stability between the circulation of the twins.",

An extremely rare form of conjoined twinning is janiceps conjoined twinning, in which 2 faces are attached but oriented in opposite directions. In this report, we present an unusual and difficult-to-classify case of conjoined male twins with partial duplication of craniofacial, upper oropharyngeal, and cardiac organs. We believe this to be one of the few reported cases of janiceps asymmetrus. We describe in detail the gross and microscopic pathology and offer some insights into the possible embryogenesis and distinction from the other rare form of conjoined twinning with facial duplication, diprosopus.",

    "abstract": "Although there is accumulating evidence that intelligence quotient (IQ) indexes some aspects of the autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs), the causal relationship between autistic traits and IQ remains controversial. We examined the sources of covariation between autistic traits and IQ. As males have a four times greater risk of ASDs than females, gender-specific effects were also explored. Autistic traits and IQ were assessed in 45 twin male-male, female-female and opposite-sex pairs ascertained by the regional screening system in Nagoya, Japan. Sex-limited Cholesky structural equation models were used to decompose the correlations between autistic traits and IQ into genetic and environmental components, including sex-specific factors. Genetic correlations between autistic traits and IQ were high and not significantly different between boys and girls (-0.94 and -0.95, respectively), but genetic factors underlying the autistic traits were not entirely shared with the IQ. The individual-specific environmental correlation between autistic traits and IQ was estimated at -0.29 for boys and -0.59 for girls. There is a substantial overlap between the genetic factors that influence individual variation in autistic traits and IQ, irrespective of gender. The individual life experiences that increase autistic traits, however, have a moderate overlap with those that contribute to individual IQs.",

    "abstract": "To study inter-twin differences in activity during early pregnancy and to examine their relationship to subsequent infant twins' temperament.\nMeasures of fetal motor activity (frequency, duration and number of movements) were collected from 26 twin pairs during ultrasound nuchal translucency scan at late first trimester and early second trimester (11 to 14 weeks gestation). In twenty-two patients, the twins were dizygotic (dichorionic); of them, 13 twin pairs were of different sexes, five were both females and four were both males. Of the four monozygotic twin pregnancies, two were dichorionic and two were monochorionic, three were both females.The more active fetus in each pair was noted according to the position and/or sex without reporting to parents. Reported maternal perception of the more active twin was documented at the mid-trimester anatomical scan. Maternally reported postnatal temperament data of the infants were collected at 3 and 6 months, using Rothbarts' Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ).\nAfter birth, maternal reports on infants' temperament and the more active twin in each pair were in good correlation with prenatal inter-twin differences in activity. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves shows a better performance of ultrasound compared with maternal perception in prediction of the more active twin.\nThe features of fetal neurobehavioral activity provide the basis for individual differences in twins' activity in infancy. Differences in activity in early pregnancy even before the emergence of fetal behavioral patterns were followed by temperamental differences postnatally.",

    "abstract": "Tracheostomy for definitive airway management in conjoined twins is a challenge for the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and support staff. A carefully choreographed multidisciplinary approach is required. A literature search finds few reports on tracheostomy in conjoined twins. We report our experience with tracheostomy with 5.5-month-old conjoined omphalopagus twins who were attached facing each other. Initial planning led to a careful rehearsal of infant positioning focused on optimizing anterior cervical exposure. A postoperative tracheostomy care plan was also addressed. Each twin was assigned his own anesthetic team and equipment early in his life to provide consistent care for the anticipated multiple surgical procedures throughout his hospital stay. Issues addressed in this report include transportation, intubation, intraoperative airway management, the mechanical ventilatory pattern of two individuals sharing a common diaphragm, and the pharmaceutical management of two children with partially shared vascular supply.",

    "abstract": "Ghrelin is a hormone that is involved in the regulation of food intake. Neuronal, endocrine, and genetic factors have been shown to regulate plasma ghrelin levels; but the determinants of fasting ghrelin concentrations are not yet fully understood. The main aim was to explore the roles of adiposity and genetic differences in determining fasting plasma total ghrelin levels. We measured total ghrelin levels in a population of 23 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for obesity. In addition, 2 variants of ghrelin gene, namely, Arg51Gln and Leu72Met, were genotyped in 3 populations of monozygotic twin pairs: 23 obesity-discordant, 43 lean-concordant, and 46 obesity-concordant twin pairs. In discordant twins, lean co-twins had higher fasting plasma total ghrelin levels (950 pg/mL, SD = 328 pg/mL) than obese twins (720 pg/mL, SD = 143 pg/mL; P = .003). Arg51Gln-polymorphism of the ghrelin gene was equally distributed between the twin groups. However, there were significant differences in genotype frequencies at the Leu72Met polymorphism between the discordant and obese-concordant groups (P = .003) and between the discordant and lean-concordant groups (P = .011), but not between the 2 concordant groups. In the discordant group, there were fewer Met carriers (4%) than among the obese (17%) or the lean-concordant groups (15%). Plasma total ghrelin levels are affected by acquired obesity independent of genetic background. The Leu72 allele is particularly common among monozygotic twins discordant for obesity, suggesting that this ghrelin allele is more permissive in the regulation of energy balance. The ghrelin gene may thus play a role in the regulation of variability of body weight, such that Leu72 allele carriers are more prone to weight variability in response to environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies have provided the basis for genetic and epidemiological studies in human complex traits. As epigenetic factors can contribute to phenotypic outcomes, we conducted a DNA methylation analysis in white blood cells (WBC), buccal epithelial cells and gut biopsies of 114 monozygotic (MZ) twins as well as WBC and buccal epithelial cells of 80 dizygotic (DZ) twins using 12K CpG island microarrays. Here we provide the first annotation of epigenetic metastability of approximately 6,000 unique genomic regions in MZ twins. An intraclass correlation (ICC)-based comparison of matched MZ and DZ twins showed significantly higher epigenetic difference in buccal cells of DZ co-twins (P = 1.2 x 10(-294)). Although such higher epigenetic discordance in DZ twins can result from DNA sequence differences, our in silico SNP analyses and animal studies favor the hypothesis that it is due to epigenomic differences in the zygotes, suggesting that molecular mechanisms of heritability may not be limited to DNA sequence differences.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies reported an association between smaller birth size and narrower retinal vascular caliber, but it remains unclear whether this association is attributed to confounding by shared environment or genetic factors. At a mean age of 9.3 years, 266 twins (49 monozygotic and 84 dizygotic pairs) in the Twins Eye Study in Tasmania underwent an ophthalmic examination including retinal photography. Retinal vascular caliber was measured using a validated protocol. The majority of these twins were also in the Tasmanian Infant Health Study, which prospectively collected data on birth parameters and antenatal maternal factors. We conducted the main analysis using linear mixed models, accounting for birth set clustering. Both the within-pair (-9.73; 95% CI: -14.68 to -4.77 microm per 5-cm decrease in birth length) and between-pair associations (-7.15; 95% CI: -11.54 to -3.01) with retinal arteriolar caliber were significant and of similar magnitude (difference in effect, P=0.61), after adjusting for age, sex, maternal smoking, mean arterial blood pressure, and other confounders. These associations remained within dizygotic and monozygotic pairs. Analyses of head circumference and retinal arteriolar caliber were similar to those of birth length (within-pair regression coefficient: -2.41; 95% CI: -5.09 to 0.28; between-pair regression coefficient: -2.60; 95% CI: -5.00 to -0.19). For birth weight, only a between-pair association was evident (-7.28; 95% CI: -13.07 to -1.48). This study demonstrates a consistent association between smaller birth size and narrower retinal arterioles in twins. The independent effect of shorter birth length on retinal arteriolar caliber supports a role for twin-specific supply line factors affecting fetal growth on vascular structure.",

    "abstract": "Unlike stunning breakthroughs in the identification of genes for Mendelian disorders during the last three decades, gene identification in most complex disorders has been full of twists and turns and little progress. Doing more of the same will not guarantee success. The lessons learned argue for a need to reconsider genetic models that are appropriate for the disorder in question along with an interdisciplinary, systematic approach using genomic methods that have now become possible. We will use schizophrenia as an example to review the genetic progress to date that has been disappointing. We will argue that the causation of this complex disease may involve heterogeneous genomic changes of major effect. We will provide three approaches, retroviral transpositions, methylation, and copy number variations, to test this hypothesis. We will present arguments to suggest that such experiments will be most effective if undertaken on monozygotic twins. It will include our experience with associated experiments on the monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia. The results support that (epi)genomic changes of major effect, rather than accumulation of mutations of small effect, underlie the causation of this complex disease. More important, this experimental strategy will be an effective strategy for studies on other complex (behavioural) disorders as well.",

    "abstract": "Infant leukemia associated with rearrangement of the MLL gene typically presents with high-risk clinical features. Relapse is common despite aggressive therapy and perturbations in signaling pathways may contribute to disease resistance. We evaluated twin 4-month-old monozygotic baby boys who presented with MLL-rearranged precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Two different MLL/AF4 variants were found in both the twins, the first involving MLL intron 8 and AF4 intron 3 and the second stemming from translocations of MLL exon 10 and AF4 exon 4. We detected expression of the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms, Ik1, Ikx+, Ik2 and the dominant-negative Ik4 Ikaros isoform in both patients. However, the dominant-negative Ik8 isoform was detected in only 1 boy, suggesting a common genetic ontogeny that was modulated by leukemic evolution. Further exploration of Ikaros expression in the background of MLL rearrangements may provide new insights into disease pathogenesis and could offer targets for novel chemotherapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "Questionnaire surveys provide an efficient means of identifying potential seizure cases in large population-based cohorts. Concerns exist, however, with regard to the reliability of self-reported information both with respect to the validity of the results obtained and with regard to the usefulness of this approach in identifying true cases. Information on history of seizures obtained by questionnaire from members of 47,626 twin pairs included in the Mid-Atlantic (MATR), Danish (DTR) and Norwegian (NTR) Twin Registries was verified using medical records and detailed clinical and family interviews. The accuracy of these reports was assessed. Self-reported epilepsy was verified in 81.9% of twins overall (86.1% (DTR), 75.6% (NTR) and 80.7% (MATR)). However, when both pair members reported a history of epilepsy in the affected pair member, epilepsy was verified in >90% of cases. Among MATR twins with a verified history of epilepsy, 21.5% reported other seizures but not epilepsy and 18.5% of verified Norwegian epilepsy cases reported no history of epilepsy themselves and were identified only through their co-twin. The results of this study indicate that the accuracy of self-reported epilepsy and febrile seizures among those who provided information on health history was high across all populations. However, the relatively large percentage of twins with a verified diagnosis who did not acknowledge epilepsy suggests that the frequency of epilepsy may be under-estimated in self-reported samples.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary fetal growth standards are created by using theoretical properties (percentiles) of birth weight (for gestational age) distributions. The authors used a clinically relevant, outcome-based methodology to determine if separate fetal growth standards are required for singletons and twins. All singleton and twin livebirths between 36 and 42 weeks' gestation in the United States (1995-2002) were included, after exclusions for missing information and other factors (n = 17,811,922). A birth weight range was identified, at each gestational age, over which serious neonatal morbidity and neonatal mortality rates were lowest. Among singleton males at 40 weeks, serious neonatal morbidity/mortality rates were lowest between 3,012 g (95% confidence interval (CI): 3,008, 3,018) and 3,978 g (95% CI: 3,976, 3,980). The low end of this optimal birth weight range for females was 37 g (95% CI: 21, 53) less. The low optimal birth weight was 152 g (95% CI: 121, 183) less for twins compared with singletons. No differences were observed in low optimal birth weight by period (1999-2002 vs. 1995-1998), but small differences were observed for maternal education, race, parity, age, and smoking status. Patterns of birth weight-specific serious neonatal morbidity/neonatal mortality support the need for plurality-specific fetal growth standards.",

    "abstract": "Although several studies have found no change or a decreased risk of childhood cancer in twins, few have controlled for potential confounders such as birth weight. We examined the association of birth plurality and childhood cancer in pooled data from five U.S. states (California, Minnesota, New York, Texas, and Washington) using linked birth-cancer registry data. The data, excluding children with Down syndrome or who died before 28 days of life, included 17,672 cases diagnosed from 1980 to 2004 at ages 28 days to 14 years and 57,966 controls with all cases and controls born from 1970 to 2004. Analyses were restricted to children weighing <or=4,000 g at birth. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for sex, gestational age, birth weight, birth order, maternal age, maternal race, state of birth, and birth year. Children who were multiples had no difference in risk of cancer overall (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.82-1.07), but a borderline reduced risk of Wilms' tumor (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.39-1.09). For children diagnosed <2 y of age there was a reduced risk of Wilms' tumor (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.09-0.86) and neuroblastoma (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.84) and an increased risk of fibrosarcoma (OR, 5.81; 95% CI, 1.53-22.11). Higher-order multiple birth (triplets or higher) was not associated with childhood cancer. Our analysis suggests that mechanisms other than birth weight and gestational age may influence the lower risk of Wilms' tumor and neuroblastoma in multiple births.",

External genitourinary malformations in KFS are not common, except for small testes. We present identical twins with a 47XXY karyotype and discordant hypospadias and concomitant chordee. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such an association. The diverse possible etiologies explaining the relationship between the presenting congenital defects in identical twins are discussed.

    "abstract": "Genital tuberculosis is a major cause of infertility in countries where tuberculosis is endemic. With recent advances in assisted reproductive technology, women with tuberculous endometritis may become pregnant and ultimately have children with congenital tuberculosis. In vitro fertilisation represents a useful treatment for infertility. Congenital tuberculosis is a rare and severe, rapidly progressive, disease. Making an early diagnosis of congenital tuberculosis is difficult, because it can mimic many neonatal illnesses. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first cases of premature twins with congenital tuberculosis following in vitro fertilisation. After the diagnosis of genital tuberculosis in the mother, the twins were screened and diagnosed for tuberculosis. The twins dramatically improved after anti-tuberculosis therapy. We also wish to draw attention to the importance of searching for genital tuberculosis as the possible cause of congenital infection, even if the mother is asymptomatic.",

    "abstract": "Despite substantial progress in understanding the anatomical and functional development of the human brain, little is known on the spatial-temporal patterns and genetic influences on white matter maturation in twins. Neuroimaging data acquired from longitudinal twin studies provide a unique platform for scientists to investigate such issues. However, the interpretation of neuroimaging data from longitudinal twin studies is hindered by the lacking of appropriate image processing and statistical tools. In this study, we developed a statistical framework for analyzing longitudinal twin neuroimaging data, which is consisted of generalized estimating equation (GEE2) and a test procedure. The GEE2 method can jointly model imaging measures with genetic effect, environmental effect, and behavioral and clinical variables. The score test statistic is used to test linear hypothesis such as the association between brain structure and function with the covariates of interest. A resampling method is used to control the family-wise error rate to adjust for multiple comparisons. With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we demonstrate the application of our statistical methods in quantifying the spatiotemporal white matter maturation patterns and in detecting the genetic effects in a longitudinal neonatal twin study. The proposed approach can be easily applied to longitudinal twin data with multiple outcomes and accommodate incomplete and unbalanced data, i.e., subjects with different number of measurements.",

    "abstract": "Information from the full diffusion tensor (DT) was used to compute voxel-wise genetic contributions to brain fiber microstructure. First, we designed a new multivariate intraclass correlation formula in the log-Euclidean framework. We then analyzed used the full multivariate structure of the tensor in a multivariate version of a voxel-wise maximum-likelihood structural equation model (SEM) that computes the variance contributions in the DTs from genetic (A), common environmental (C) and unique environmental (E) factors. Our algorithm was tested on DT images from 25 identical and 25 fraternal twin pairs. After linear and fluid registration to a mean template, we computed the intraclass correlation and Falconer's heritability statistic for several scalar DT-derived measures and for the full multivariate tensors. Covariance matrices were found from the DTs, and inputted into SEM. Analyzing the full DT enhanced the detection of A and C effects. This approach should empower imaging genetics studies that use DTI.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has indicated that friends' drinking may influence alcohol use in adolescents and young adults. We explored whether similarities in the drinking behavior of friends of twins influence the genetic architecture of alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. Survey data from The Netherlands Twin Register were available for 1,526 twin pairs aged 16-25 years. We categorized the twin pairs as concordant (both report similar alcohol use in their friends) or discordant for the alcohol use of their friends. Genetic moderator models were tested by carrying out multi-group analyzes in Mplus. Findings showed a significant moderation effect. Genetic factors were more and common environment less important in the explanation of variation in alcohol use in twins discordant for alcohol use of friends than in twins concordant for alcohol use of friends.",

    "abstract": "We have shown previously that treadmill exercise within lower body negative pressure (LBNPex) maintains upright exercise capacity (peak oxygen consumption, Vo(2peak)) in men after 5, 15, and 30 days of bed rest (BR). We hypothesized that LBNPex protects treadmill Vo(2peak) and sprint speed in women during a 30-day BR. Seven sets of female monozygous twins volunteered to participate. Within each twin set, one was randomly assigned to a control group (Con) and performed no countermeasures, and the other was assigned to an exercise group (Ex) and performed a 40-min interval (40-80% pre-BR Vo(2peak)) LBNPex (51 +/- 5 mmHg) protocol, plus 5 min of static LBNP, 6 days per week. Before and immediately after BR, subjects completed a 30.5-m sprint test and an upright graded treadmill test to volitional fatigue. These results in women were compared with previously reported reductions in Vo(2peak) and sprint speed in male twins after BR. In women, sprint speed (-8 +/- 2%) and Vo(2peak) (-6 +/- 2%) were not different after BR in the Ex group. In contrast, both sprint speed (-24 +/- 5%) and Vo(2peak) (-16 +/- 3%) were significantly less after BR in the Con group. The effect of BR on sprint speed and Vo(2peak) after BR was not different between women and men. We conclude that treadmill exercise within LBNP protects against BR-induced reductions in Vo(2peak) and sprint speed in women and should prove effective during long-duration spaceflight.",

Using a co-twin design, we examined dietary and body composition influences on adiponectin by conducting matched, within-pair analyses to eliminate confounding. Following multivariable adjustment within-twin pairs, significant influences on adiponectin (log-transformed, percent change per SD of the dietary/body composition variable) were observed for nonstarch polysaccharides (3.25%; 95% CI: 0.06, 6.54; P < 0.05) and magnesium intake (3.80%; 95%CI: 0.17, 7.57; P < 0.05), with a trend toward an association for fruit and vegetable (F&V) intakes (2.55%; 95% CI: -0.26, 5.45; P = 0.08). These modest positive associations cannot be explained by confounding through other lifestyle factors shared by the twins. A significant relationship between adiponectin and 3 derived dietary patterns (F&V, dieting, traditional English), carbohydrate, protein, trans fat, and alcohol intake was also observed. Strong inverse associations with adiponectin were observed for BMI (-10.72%; 95% CI: -13.78, -7.55), total (-6.89%: 95% CI: -10.34, -3.30; P < 0.05), and central fat mass (-12.50%; 95% CI: -15.82, -9.05; P < 0.05); these relationships were significant both when twins were analyzed as individuals and when characteristics were contrasted within-twin pairs, suggesting a direct effect. We observed modest associations between dietary factors and adiponectin in female twins, independent of adiposity, and report strong inverse associations with body composition. These data reinforce the importance of weight maintenance and increasing consumption of diets rich in plant-based foods to prevent CVD and type 2 diabetes.",

We report 11 year old identical twin brothers with TCS associated with the conus at the normal level. Their presenting symptom was progressive leg pain and both patients underwent surgical interruption of the filum terminale. The pain recurred in one patient treated surgically only after symptom became worse but resolved immediately in the other sibling treated promptly. We indicate the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of TCS to obtain excellent long-term outcome despite the absence of a low set conus or specific symptoms. Furthermore, when a twin or sibling of an affected person has neurological symptoms and the cutaneous signature of spinal dysraphism, radiological examination should be performed to establish the cause.",

    "abstract": "A unique situation of twins with similar sagittal synostosis pathology who underwent different surgical corrective procedures allowed us an opportunity to compare an endoscopic technique to the more traditional technique of a modified cranial vault remodeling (CVR). At 4 months of age, 1 twin underwent an endoscopic-assisted extended strip craniectomy with postoperative helmet therapy for 12 months, and the other underwent a reverse pi CVR procedure. Cephalic index, the Whitaker Aesthetic score, and developmental tests were used for comparison during a 6-year follow-up. The modified CVR had a superior outcome compared to the endoscopic procedure with regard to cephalic index measurements (CVR = 77; endoscopic = 63; P < 0.05) and the Whitaker score (CVR = 1 or no revisions necessary; endoscopic = 2.3 or minor to major bony work required for correction). Patients had similar intelligence quotient test scores; however, the endoscopic patient had lower scores in both preschool tests and global evaluations compared with the normal scores of the CVR patient. The modified CVR procedure was superior to the endoscopic procedure, at least in these twins with sagittal synostosis.",

Cardiac manifestations may include left ventricular wall thickening and both systolic and diastolic dysfunctions. We describe a group of family members, including a pair of identical twins, each of whom suffered from thalassaemia major requiring multiple transfusions. Cardiac magnetic resonance demonstrated myocardial iron overload, and impairment of systolic function.

    "abstract": "We examined the genetic architecture of a Tower of London test of planning and problem-solving in 690 middle-aged male twins. Phenotypic analyses revealed only one general factor, but the best-fitting genetic model indicated two correlated genetic factors: speed and efficiency. One variable-number of attempts required to mentally figure the puzzles-loaded on both factors. Shared environmental effects could be dropped with virtually no reduction in model fit. Despite significant nonshared environmental correlations across measures, there was no discernable nonshared environmental factor structure. The correlation between genetic factors (r = 0.46) and the variable loading on both factors could reflect modulation of planning, testing alternatives, and working memory that are required to perform the test. Such coordinated activity is consistent with the notion of a supervisory attentional system, a central executive, or metacognitive ability. The different phenotypic and genetic factor results suggest that relying solely on the former could obscure genetic associations.",

    "abstract": "The primary aim was to review the graft and patient survival of all recipients of a living identical twin donor renal transplant in the United States and United Kingdom, between 1988 and 2004. The secondary aim was to assess their maintenance immunosuppression.\nData of all the patients who underwent living identical twin donor renal transplantation in the United States and United Kingdom during 1988-2004 were retrieved from United Network for Organ Sharing and UK transplant, respectively. Further data were retrieved by sending letters to the individual transplant units in the United Kingdom.\nThere were 120 living identical twin donor renal transplants in the United States and 12 in the United Kingdom during the study period. Graft survival was 99.17%, 91.84%, and 88.96% in the US group at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, and 83.3%, 83.3%, and 75% in the UK group during the same follow-up period. Patient survival was 100%, 97.01%, and 97.01% in the US group at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, and 100% in the UK group during the same 5-year follow-up period. A large number of patients were on some form of immunosuppression.\nGraft and patient survival were good in both countries. These results are better than those published in the literature over the previous 20 years. Although phenotypic differences in monozygotic twins can exist, immunosuppression may be unnecessary in all these patients. Ideally, all identical twins who are currently on immunosuppression should undergo zygosity testing to establish whether they should continue the immunosuppression unless they need it for another reason.",

    "abstract": "To examine the extent to which a common genetic pathway is also involved in the relationship between depressive symptoms, in the absence of major depressive disorder (MDD), and inflammation. Recent data suggested that MDD and inflammation share common genes.\nWe recruited 188 male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry who were free of symptomatic coronary artery disease and MDD, with mean +/- standard deviation (SD) age of 55 +/- 2.75 years, including 54 monozygotic and 40 dizygotic twin pairs. These pairs were assessed for two inflammatory markers, interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP). Current depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the phenotypic association between depression and inflammatory markers. Biometrical genetic modeling was performed to estimate the genetic and environmental contributions to this association.\nAn association was observed between severity of current depressive symptoms and increased levels of inflammatory markers (p < .001 for IL-6 and p = .005 for CRP). After adjustment for other factors, the association was slightly attenuated but remained statistically significant for IL-6 (p = .002). The heritability of IL-6, CRP, and depressive symptoms were estimated as 0.37, 0.65, and 0.48, respectively. Genetic modeling found a significant genetic correlation between IL-6 and depressive symptoms (r(G) = 0.22, p = .046), indicating that about 66% of the covariance between them can be explained by shared genetic influences.\nCurrent depressive symptoms are significantly correlated with inflammatory markers. This covariation is due, in large part, to genes that are common to depressive symptoms and inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate quantitative sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) frequencies in monozygotic twins discordant for chronic fatigue syndrome.\nThirteen pairs of female twins underwent polysomnography. During the first night, they adapted to the sleep laboratory, and during the second night, their baseline sleep was assessed. Visual stage scoring was conducted on sleep electroencephalographic records according to standard criteria, and power spectral analysis was used to quantify delta through beta frequency bands, processed in 6-s blocks. Data were averaged across sleep stage within each twin and coded for sleep stage and the presence or absence of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). A completely within-subjects repeated measure multivariate analysis of variance evaluated twin pairs by frequency band by sleep stage interactions and simple effects. The relationship between alpha and delta EEG was also assessed across twin pairs.\nNo significant differences in spectral power in any frequency band were found between those with CFS and their nonfatigued cotwins. Phasic alpha activity, coupled with delta was noted in five subjects with CFS but was also present in 4/5 healthy twins, indicating this finding likely reflects genetic influences on the sleep electroencephalogram rather than disease-specific sleep pathology.\nThe genetic influences on sleep polysomnography and microarchitecture appear to be stronger than the disease influence of chronic fatigue syndrome, despite greater subjective sleep complaint among the CFS twins. EEG techniques that focus on short duration events or paradigms that probe sleep regulation may provide a better description of sleep abnormalities in CFS.",

    "abstract": "Patients with x-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED, OMIM 305100) often present with exceptional oral conditions, because alveolar ridges can remain severely hypotrophic due to oligo- or anodontia in the primary and/or permanent dentition. This can seriously disable a young person physically and psychologically, and lead to sociopsychological isolation.\nThe oral rehabilitation of fraternal male twins with XLHED, one with severe hypodontia and the other with anodontia is described. The treatment of both patients comprised augmentation of the jaws using bicortical corticocancellous bone blocks from the medial aspect of the anterior hip, delayed implantation, and restoration of the occlusion with bar-retained overdentures. The multidisciplinary team approach included an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, a prosthodontist, and a speech therapist.\nAfter uneventful healing, the 12-month follow-up showed that sufficient osseointegration of the implants for optimized function was obtained by creating adequate de novo bone volume in the underdeveloped jaw regions. Full regular masticatory function was achieved, and esthetics were improved considerably in both patients.\nAugmentation and implant placement prior to prosthetic rehabilitation appears to be a suitable treatment option for adult patients with XLHED.",

    "abstract": "Social competence is one of the most important accomplishments of human development, and this skill in human relationships is learned through communication. Therefore, it is considered that delays in language development could be a barrier to building human relationships and social competence. Although it is well known that there are delays in language development in twins compared with that of singletons, little is known about how these linguistic delays affect the development of social competence. Because twin language is a language that is unique to each pair of twins and cannot be understood by either their mother or others, it may be assumed that the social competence of twins who have a twin language is less than that of twins who don't have a twin language. Therefore, in this prospective longitudinal study we also investigated the relationship between twin language and social competence. A mailed questionnaire survey was conducted in 958 mothers as a follow-up of a study conducted in 2004. As a result, 522 respondents returned the questionnaire (53.9%). In this study, we used only 256 twins aged 6- 12-years-old (school-age children) for analysis, excluding those with missing values. Multiple logistic regression analysis was employed. In the second child of twins, a low birth weight, the appearance of twin language and gestosis of the mother were positively related with social unbalance (OR = 1.846, 2.022 and 1.903). On the other hand, with the first child, however, there was no such link. The present results indicate that twin language might influence social competence in school-age children. It has been believed that linguistic intervention is unnecessary, because most twin language disappears spontaneously. However, early intervention, for example linguistic assistance by public health nurses or psychologists and early enrollment in a preschool may be necessary for twins with a twin language, to avoid adverse consequences in social competence at school-age.",

    "abstract": "Discordant twin gestation, in which one fetus is growth restricted, is a unique model that can elucidate the mechanism(s) by which the intrauterine environment affects fetal growth.\nThe objective of the study was to determine the cord blood adiponectin and leptin concentrations and evaluate their association with birth weight in dichorionic twins, with and without growth discordance. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: In this cross-sectional study, arterial cord blood adiponectin and leptin concentrations were determined in two groups of newborns: 1) discordant twins, in which one of the twins is growth restricted (small for gestation age and abnormal umbilical arteries Doppler) and the other is appropriate for gestation age (AGA) (n = 14 pairs); and 2) concordant twins, in which both twins are AGA (n = 15 pairs).\nResults were: 1) within the discordant twins group, the median adiponectin concentration was significantly lower in the growth-restricted newborns than in their cotwins (P = 0.004); 2) within the concordant twin group, there was no significant difference in the median cord blood adiponectin concentration between the two AGA twins; 3) the median leptin concentration did not differ between the twins pairs in both study groups; 4) a positive correlation between cord blood adiponectin concentrations and both birth weight (r = 0.7, P < 0.001) and gestational age (r = 0.6, P < 0.02) was found only in the small-for-gestational-age newborns; 5) linear regression model revealed that birth weight is independently associated with circulating adiponectin concentration.\nLow circulating adiponectin concentrations, previously reported in adults, children, and infants who were born small for gestational age, characterize fetuses with growth restriction and are independently associated with birth weight.",

    "abstract": "The principal causal components of an osteoporotic fracture are a fall and weakened bone strength. While bone quality measures have been frequently studied, the ability of simple measures of impaired balance to predict fracture risk has received less attention. Computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted between 1998 and 2000 among 24,598 Swedish twins aged 55 years or older. Impaired balance at the time of interview was reported by 2,890 (12%) of the twins. Twin pairs who were discordant with regard to impaired balance were selected for analysis and followed for fractures through 2005. In a pairwise analysis, the odds ratio for hip fracture was 3.13 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.62, 6.05) among twins with impaired balance as compared with their co-twins with normal balance. When previously recognized clinical risk factors for osteoporotic fracture were considered in the model, the odds ratio for hip fracture with impaired balance was 3.88 (95% CI: 1.40, 10.72). Approximately 40% of all hip fractures were attributable to impaired balance. The odds ratios for any fracture and any osteoporotic fracture for twins with impaired balance were 2.00 (95% CI: 1.29, 3.11) and 2.39 (95% CI: 1.49, 3.82), respectively. These results imply that self-reported impaired balance is a novel and readily assessed risk factor for future fractures in the elderly.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare complication of monochorionic twinning. Although most conjoined twins are stillborn or die in the newborn period, surgical advances are such that many parents will continue a pregnancy in the hopes that live born infants can be separated. Well-described types of conjoined twins account for most cases, with some rarer forms occasionally seen. Each type is associated with specific degrees of organ sharing, structural abnormalities, complications, and challenges with regard to potential separation. Thorough multidisciplinary prenatal assessment of conjoined twins is essential to appropriately counsel parents, to manage the pregnancy, and to create an appropriate delivery plan. This pictorial essay presents the imaging findings of the more common types of conjoined twins. Selected clinical and autopsy images are used to illustrate shared anatomy. The nomenclature for description of conjoined twins is reviewed, the imaging findings of each type are illustrated, and the challenges to separation are discussed.",

Mean gestational age of the twin pairs was 32.6 weeks (range, 24-39).\nThe ParadigmHealth database was queried for all twin admissions from January 2001 to June 2004 admitted to 453 NICUs across the United States. Discordance was calculated for each twin set as defined as greater than 20% difference in birth weight. Exclusion criteria were death of a twin, congenital anomalies, or extracorporeal life support.\nDemographics, respiratory needs, feeding characteristics, complications, and discharge needs.\nA total of 384 discordant twin pairs met inclusion criteria. The larger twins required more ventilation/continuous positive airway pressure (55% vs 44%, P < .01) and/or oxygen therapy (50% vs 41%, P = .02) compared with smaller twins. Smaller twins reached full oral (PO) feeds an average of 0.6 weeks later than larger twins (P < .0001) but had more weight gain per day. Smaller twins transitioned to an open crib at lower weights but at slightly greater age. No differences were noted with necrotizing enterocolitis or apnea. Smaller twins had increased nosocomial infections. Mean length of stay was shorter (P = .0036) in the larger twin group. Only 33% of the twin pairs were discharged on the same day.\nLarger twins had more acute respiratory issues but achieved certain milestones more rapidly with fewer complications, thus leading to earlier discharge compared with their smaller twin counterparts.",

    "abstract": "AKT1, encoding the protein kinase B, has been associated with the genetic etiology of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However, minuscule data exist on the role of different alleles of AKT1 in measurable quantitative endophenotypes, such as cognitive abilities and neuroanatomical features, showing deviations in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We evaluated the contribution of AKT1 to quantitative cognitive traits and 3D high-resolution neuroanatomical images in a Finnish twin sample consisting of 298 twins: 61 pairs with schizophrenia (8 concordant), 31 pairs with bipolar disorder (5 concordant) and 65 control pairs matched for age, sex and demographics. An AKT1 allele defined by the SNP rs1130214 located in the UTR of the gene revealed association with cognitive traits related to verbal learning and memory (P = 0.0005 for a composite index). This association was further fortified by a higher degree of resemblance of verbal memory capacity in pairs sharing the rs1130214 genotype compared to pairs not sharing the genotype. Furthermore, the same allele was also associated with decreased gray matter density in medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (P < 0.05). Our findings support the role of AKT1 in the genetic background of cognitive and anatomical features, known to be affected by psychotic disorders. The established association of the same allelic variant of AKT1 with both cognitive and neuroanatomical aberrations could suggest that AKT1 exerts its effect on verbal learning and memory via neural networks involving prefrontal cortex.",

    "abstract": "Both obesity and exercise behavior are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. However, whether obesity and physical inactivity share the same genetic vs environmental etiology has rarely been studied. We therefore analyzed these complex relationships, and also examined whether physical activity modifies the degree of genetic influence on body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC).\nThe FinnTwin16 Study is a population-based, longitudinal study of five consecutive birth cohorts (1975-1979) of Finnish twins. Data on height, weight, WC and physical activity of 4343 subjects at the average age of 25 (range, 22-27 years) years were obtained by a questionnaire and self-measurement of WC. Quantitative genetic analyses based on linear structural equations were carried out by the Mx statistical package. The modifying effect of physical activity on genetic and environmental influences was analyzed using gene-environment interaction models.\nThe overall heritability estimates were 79% in males and 78% in females for BMI, 56 and 71% for WC and 55 and 54% for physical activity, respectively. There was an inverse relationship between physical activity and WC in males (r = -0.12) and females (r=-0.18), and between physical activity and BMI in females (r = -0.12). Physical activity significantly modified the heritability of BMI and WC, with a high level of physical activity decreasing the additive genetic component in BMI and WC.\nPhysically active subjects were leaner than sedentary ones, and physical activity reduced the influence of genetic factors to develop high BMI and WC. This suggests that the individuals at greatest genetic risk for obesity would benefit the most from physical activity.",

Clinical data and perinatal outcome were compared between cases with and without increased MCA-PSV.\nIncreased MCA-PSV was observed in 7 recipients (23.3%) within 14 days after FLP. MCA-PSV gradually decreased to <1.5 multiples of median in 6 recipients; however, 1 patient resulted in fetal demise subsequent to the demise of the co-twin. The incidences of fetal and neonatal demise and neurological morbidity were similar. No recipient was diagnosed as anemic at birth.\nThe increase in MCA-PSV in recipients following FLP appeared to be generally transitory; this differs from twin anemia-polycythemia sequence.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that genetic factors are involved in the occurrence of sleep terrors. Twin studies provide invaluable information regarding genetic and environmental factors that can affect the manifestation of the disease; however, most previous twin studies on sleep terrors were performed retrospectively or with a sample that was too small to yield conclusive results. The aim of this large prospective study was to clarify the genetic and environmental contributions to sleep terrors in childhood.\nIn all, 390 pairs of monozygotic and dizygotic twins were recruited at birth for a longitudinal study. The prevalence and frequency of sleep terrors were assessed at 18 and 30 months of age with a questionnaire administered to the biological mother of the twins. Zygosity was determined by a questionnaire and genotyping. The prevalence and polychoric correlation for each type of twins were calculated. Structural-equation modeling was used to determine the proportion of variance attributable to additive genetic, shared, and nonshared environmental factors.\nThe prevalence of sleep terrors was 36.9% at 18 months and 19.7% at 30 months; 49% of affected children were boys, and 51% were girls. At 18 months, the polychoric correlations were 0.63 for monozygotic and 0.36 for the dizygotic twins. These were 0.68 (monozygotic) and 0.24 (dizygotic) at 30 months. Our model-fitting analysis showed that sleep terrors were explained by a 2-component model at 18 months (43.7% additive genetic effects and 56.3% nonshared environment) and at 30 months (41.5% additive genetic effects and 58.5% nonshared environment).\nThese results strongly support the heritability of sleep terrors. There also seems to be continuity in genetic effects with the persistence of sleep-terror symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The human distal gut harbours a vast ensemble of microbes (the microbiota) that provide important metabolic capabilities, including the ability to extract energy from otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides. Studies of a few unrelated, healthy adults have revealed substantial diversity in their gut communities, as measured by sequencing 16S rRNA genes, yet how this diversity relates to function and to the rest of the genes in the collective genomes of the microbiota (the gut microbiome) remains obscure. Studies of lean and obese mice suggest that the gut microbiota affects energy balance by influencing the efficiency of calorie harvest from the diet, and how this harvested energy is used and stored. Here we characterize the faecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity, and their mothers, to address how host genotype, environmental exposure and host adiposity influence the gut microbiome. Analysis of 154 individuals yielded 9,920 near full-length and 1,937,461 partial bacterial 16S rRNA sequences, plus 2.14 gigabases from their microbiomes. The results reveal that the human gut microbiome is shared among family members, but that each person's gut microbial community varies in the specific bacterial lineages present, with a comparable degree of co-variation between adult monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. However, there was a wide array of shared microbial genes among sampled individuals, comprising an extensive, identifiable 'core microbiome' at the gene, rather than at the organismal lineage, level. Obesity is associated with phylum-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial diversity and altered representation of bacterial genes and metabolic pathways. These results demonstrate that a diversity of organismal assemblages can nonetheless yield a core microbiome at a functional level, and that deviations from this core are associated with different physiological states (obese compared with lean).",

    "abstract": "Although twin deliveries after assisted reproduction treatment (ART) are common, the mental health of the parents has scarcely been addressed. Therefore, we evaluated the psychological well-being of ART and spontaneously conceiving parents of twins and singletons. Furthermore, the impact of parity and children's health-related factors on mental health was evaluated.\nWe conducted a prospective longitudinal questionnaire study among ART parents of 91 pairs of twins and of 367 singletons and on control parents of 20 pairs of twins and of 379 singletons in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy (T1), and when the children were 2 months (T2) and 1-year old (T3). Symptoms of depression and anxiety, sleeping difficulties and social dysfunction were addressed via a questionnaire. The effects of parity and child-related factors were assessed at T2.\nAt T1, ART mothers of twins showed fewer symptoms of depression than control mothers of twins (P < 0.05). At T2, both ART and control mothers of twins had more symptoms of depression and anxiety than all mothers of singletons (F = 5.20, P < 0.05 and F = 3.93, P < 0.05, respectively). At T3, both ART and control mothers of twins continued to report more symptoms of depression than the mothers of singletons (F = 10.01, P < 0.01), but a difference in anxiety symptoms was seen only in the control group. All fathers had similar mental health at T1. At T2, ART and control fathers of twins reported more symptoms of depression (F = 4.15, P < 0.05) and social dysfunction than fathers of singletons. At T3, both ART and control fathers of twins had more symptoms of depression (F = 4.29, P < 0.05) and anxiety (F = 5.40, P < 0.05) than fathers of singletons. Control fathers of twins had more sleeping difficulties than fathers of singletons (F = 6.66, P < 0.01). Parity did not differently affect parental mental health at T2 in the study groups. Prematurity did not affect maternal mental health, but it had a negative impact on control fathers' social dysfunction (F = 3.34, P < 0.05).\nTwin parenthood, but not ART, has a negative impact on the mental health of mothers and fathers during the transition to parenthood. ART parents' mental health was not affected by parity or children's health-related factors.",

    "abstract": "Despite substantial progress in measuring the anatomical and functional variability of the human brain, little is known about the genetic and environmental causes of these variations. Here we developed an automated system to visualize genetic and environmental effects on brain structure in large brain MRI databases. We applied our multi-template segmentation approach termed \"Multi-Atlas Fluid Image Alignment\" to fluidly propagate hand-labeled parameterized surface meshes, labeling the lateral ventricles, in 3D volumetric MRI scans of 76 identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins (38 pairs; mean age=24.6 (SD=1.7)); and 56 same-sex fraternal (dizygotic, DZ) twins (28 pairs; mean age=23.0 (SD=1.8)), scanned as part of a 5-year research study that will eventually study over 1000 subjects. Mesh surfaces were averaged within subjects to minimize segmentation error. We fitted quantitative genetic models at each of 30,000 surface points to measure the proportion of shape variance attributable to (1) genetic differences among subjects, (2) environmental influences unique to each individual, and (3) shared environmental effects. Surface-based statistical maps, derived from path analysis, revealed patterns of heritability, and their significance, in 3D. Path coefficients for the 'ACE' model that best fitted the data indicated significant contributions from genetic factors (A=7.3%), common environment (C=38.9%) and unique environment (E=53.8%) to lateral ventricular volume. Earlier-maturing occipital horn regions may also be more genetically influenced than later-maturing frontal regions. Maps visualized spatially-varying profiles of environmental versus genetic influences. The approach shows promise for automatically measuring gene-environment effects in large image databases.",

Both babies were affected by duodenal atresia, associated in the first case with a complete mucosal duodenal membrane and in the second one with an \"apple-peel\" jejunal atresia. These occurrences may suggest that they were either the consequence of linkage of 2 genes or a pleiotropic expression of a single gene responsible for such rare conditions.",

    "abstract": "The chloroplast cpn20 protein is a functional homolog of the cpn10 co-chaperonin, but its gene consists of two cpn10-like units joined head-to-tail by a short chain of amino acids. This double protein is unique to plastids and was shown to exist in plants as well plastid-containing parasites. In vitro assays showed that this cpn20 co-chaperonin is a functional homolog of cpn10. In terms of structure, existing data indicate that the oligomer is tetrameric, yet it interacts with a heptameric cpn60 partner. Thus, the functional oligomeric structure remains a mystery. In this review, we summarize what is known about this distinctive chaperonin and use a bioinformatics approach to examine the expression of cpn20 in Arabidopsis thaliana relative to other chaperonin genes in this species. In addition, we examine the primary structure of the two homologous domains for similarities and differences, in comparison with cpn10 from other species. Lastly, we hypothesize as to the oligomeric structure and raison d'\u00eatre of this unusual co-chaperonin homolog.",

    "abstract": "Earlier studies have established that a substantial percentage of variance in obesity-related phenotypes is explained by genetic components. However, only one study has used both virtual twins (VTs) and biological twins and was able to simultaneously estimate additive genetic, non-additive genetic, shared environmental and unshared environmental components in body mass index (BMI). Our current goal was to re-estimate four components of variance in BMI, applying a more rigorous model to biological and virtual multiples with additional data. Virtual multiples share the same family environment, offering unique opportunities to estimate common environmental influence on phenotypes that cannot be separated from the non-additive genetic component using only biological multiples.\nData included 929 individuals from 164 monozygotic twin pairs, 156 dizygotic twin pairs, five triplet sets, one quadruplet set, 128 VT pairs, two virtual triplet sets and two virtual quadruplet sets. Virtual multiples consist of one biological child (or twins or triplets) plus one same-aged adoptee who are all raised together since infancy. We estimated the additive genetic, non-additive genetic, shared environmental and unshared random components in BMI using a linear mixed model. The analysis was adjusted for age, age(2), age(3), height, height(2), height(3), gender and race.\nBoth non-additive genetic and common environmental contributions were significant in our model (P-values<0.0001). No significant additive genetic contribution was found. In all, 63.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 51.8-75.3%) of the total variance of BMI was explained by a non-additive genetic component, 25.7% (95% CI 13.8-37.5%) by a common environmental component and the remaining 10.7% by an unshared component.\nOur results suggest that genetic components play an essential role in BMI and that common environmental factors such as diet or exercise also affect BMI. This conclusion is consistent with our earlier study using a smaller sample and shows the utility of virtual multiples for separating non-additive genetic variance from common environmental variance.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with dyslexia are at an increased risk for anxiety disorders (e.g. generalized anxiety disorder, stress disorders, panic disorder). The extent to which this association is mediated by genetic and/or environmental influences is unclear. The current study explored the relationship between these two phenotypes using a large population-based twin sample. In total, 940 monozygotic and 903 dizygotic female twin pairs were included in the analyses. The presence of dyslexia and anxiety was determined by self-report of diagnosis by a health professional. Tetrachoric correlations confirmed an association between the two phenotypes, but suggested that there was no evidence for shared genetic risks. Bivariate twin modelling corroborated this finding and indicated the relationship between dyslexia and anxiety is mediated by shared environmental factors. Future research should seek to identifying the environmental factors that increase the vulnerability of individuals with dyslexia to emotional problems should be a priority for future research.",

    "abstract": "Habitual dietary intake is a complex behavior that may have both biological and nonbiological bases. We estimated the contribution of genetic and environmental influences on dietary intake in a large population-based sample of healthy twins. Data originated from a cross-sectional study of 600 male and female healthy twin pairs with self-reported food consumption frequency using a validated questionnaire with 247 foods and recipes. Estimates of relative proportion of additive genetic, nonadditive genetic, shared environmental, and unshared environmental effects on various aspects of dietary intake were obtained by quantitative genetic modeling of twin data based on linear structural equations. The analyses demonstrated genetic influence on total energy, macronutrient energy, and dietary fiber intakes, the glycemic index and the glycemic load of the foods consumed, and the dietary energy density, with significant heritability estimates ranging from 0.25 (0.11-0.38) to 0.47 (0.31-0.60) in men and 0.32 (0.12-0.48) to 0.49 (0.35-0.61) in women. When analyzing dietary intake as the intake of energy from 20 food groups, the genetic and environmental influences differed among food groups and between gender. For some food groups (fruit for both genders, poultry and eggs for men), no genetic influence was found, whereas nonadditive genetic effects were demonstrated for other food groups (juices and eggs for women). A number of food groups had shared environmental influences (potatoes, vegetables, fruits, poultry, fish, margarine, and candy). These results provide evidence for both genetic and shared environmental effects on dietary intake. Although the remaining nonshared environmental effects include measurement errors, there appears to be considerable potential for individually modifiable effects.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic dental injuries are a major cause of morbidity among children. Investigation of risk factors of dental trauma is important to take preventive measures in patients at high risk for tooth accidents. The aim of this work was to conduct a pilot study in twins, assessing concordance of suffered traumatic dental and facial injuries. Comparison of concordances between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs was performed in order to investigate possible genetically determined accident-proneness. Standardized interviews were conducted focusing on the frequency of orofacial accidents and their circumstances. In addition, the front teeth of all participating twins were clinically examined. A total of 104 twins (52 twin pairs) were surveyed: 31 of the 52 twin pairs were DZ and 21 pairs were MZ. 36 (34.6%) of the 104 interviewees had already suffered from a tooth injury, whereas 53 (51%) of the participants had experienced a facial injury. Investigation of concordances of suffered traumatic dental injuries revealed that 66.7% of the MZ twin pairs and 58.1% of the DZ pairs were concordant. With respect to facial traumata, 52.4% of the MZ pairs compared to 58.1% of the DZ pairs were concordant. Differences between zygosity were not statistically significant (P >/= 0.05). With the present pilot study, no statistical evidence of genetic risk for dental and facial injuries could be displayed. On the contrary, environmental factors seem to dominate in determining an individual's risk for orofacial traumata.",

It seems that its development may be influenced by both genetic predisposition and environmental factors, at varying degrees. International bibliography features few cases of monozygotic twins with congenital scoliosis. The aim of this study is to report a case in monozygotic twins and review the literature relating to the description of similar cases as well as the pathophysiological mechanism involved in its development.\nClinical examination and simple X-rays revealed scoliosis of differing degrees and types in male monozygotic twins with moderate mental retardation and dyslalia.\nCongenital scoliosis identified in both twins. In the first, this was manifested as left thoracic scoliosis, with Cobb angle of 34 degrees while in the second as left thoracolumbar scoliosis with Cobb angle of 10 degrees. Both were found to suffer from incarcerated hemivertebrae.\nAccording to both its clinical identification and severity and to its course, not only the genetic but the environmental factors seem to play a leading role in the appearance of the condition.",

    "abstract": "If the adaptive significance of specific fears changes with age, the genetic contribution to individual differences may be lowest at the age of greatest salience. The roles of genes and environment in the developmental-genetic trajectory of five common childhood fears are explored in 1094 like-sex pairs of male and female monozygotic and dizygotic twins assessed on up to three occasions during adolescence (ages 8-18 years).\nDichotomous self-ratings of a cluster of five correlated fears from Ollendick's schedule of fears (FSSC-R) were extracted for subjects at each occasion of assessment. The effects of genes and environment on overall level of fears and rates of adolescent decline were explored by fitting an item-response theory ('IRT') model that allowed for individual genetic and environmental differences in initial fear level ('intercept') and rates of adolescent change ('slope') across the repeated waves of measurement. Different forms of the model were explored using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to derive the posterior distribution of subject and item parameters from the raw responses.\nAdditive genetic differences affect the common factor underlying the five fear-items. The same genes also affect rates of change with age, especially in boys. Male adolescents with higher overall genetic predisposition to childhood fears tended to show slower recovery with age than subjects with relatively low initial values. Thus, the genetic variance apparently increases with age.\nThis finding is consistent with a prediction that the regulation of genetic differences will be strongest, and thus the additive genetic variance will be smallest, at the age when the particular stimulus is most salient. Items differed in the extent to which they were sensitive to underlying random differences in the rate of developmental change. Individual differences in rates of change with age were more marked in boys than girls.",

    "abstract": "Common polymorphisms of the CD36 fatty acid transporter gene have been associated with lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease. Association of a CD36 promoter single nucleotide polymorphism genotype with anthropometry and serum lipids was investigated in normal subjects, and in obese subjects during an 8-week low calorie diet and 6-month weight-maintenance period. 2728 normal female Twins UK subjects (mean body mass index 24.8 +/- 4.4 kg/m2; age 47.3 +/- 12.5 y) and 183 obese male and female Spanish subjects (mean body mass index 30.6 +/- 3.0 kg/m2; age 35.0 +/- 5.0 y) were genotyped for the CD36-22674 T/C (rs2151916) promoter single nucleotide polymorphism. In the Twins UK full cohort, the C-allele was associated with lower low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p = .02, N = 2396). No associations were found in the obese Spanish subjects at baseline, but 6 months after the end of the low-calorie diet, the C-allele was associated with lower total- (p = .03) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p = .01) and higher high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p = .01). Intake of saturated fatty acids was lower in carriers of the C-allele at baseline, but not significantly so (p = .11). However, 6 months after the end of the low-calorie diet, elements of the lipid profile were correlated with saturated fatty acid intake: total cholesterol r = .21, p = .060; low density lipoprotein-cholesterol: r = .25, p = .043; high density lipoprotein-cholesterol: r = -.26, p = .007. CD36 promoter SNP allele -22674C is therefore associated with lower serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol in normal female twins and with improved lipid profile during weight loss and maintenance in obese subjects.",

    "abstract": "Recent clinic-based and population-based studies have shown evidence of association between ADHD and autistic symptoms in children and adolescents as well as evidence for genetic overlap between these disorders. The objective of the current study was to confirm the association between autistic and ADHD symptoms in a young adult twin sample assessed by self-report, and investigate whether shared genetic and/or environmental factors can explain the association. We performed twin-based structural equation modeling using self-report data from 11 Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) items and 12 DSM-IV ADHD inattentive and impulsive symptom items obtained from 674 young adult Australian twins. Phenotypic correlation between autistic and ADHD symptoms was moderate. The most parsimonious univariate models for SRS and ADHD included additive genetic effects and unique environmental effects, without sex differences. ADHD and autistic traits were both moderately heritable. In a bivariate model, genetic correlation (r(g)) between SRS and ADHD was 0.72. Our results suggest that in young adults, a substantial proportion of the genetic influences on self-reported autistic and ADHD symptoms may be shared between the two disorders.",

    "abstract": "Life satisfaction and quality of sleep are important, related components of subjective well-being and general health. However, no earlier investigation is known to have tested the direction of the temporal relation between poor sleep and diminished life satisfaction, including simultaneous examination of shared genetic influences. These features were examined in the present study of a nationwide cohort of 18,631 same-sex Finnish twins with repeated measurements of life satisfaction, sleep quality, and several potential confounders within an interval of 6 years (1975 and 1981). Most individuals (59%) with new-onset life dissatisfaction had experienced suboptimal sleep at baseline. Poor sleep predicted a consistent pattern of life dissatisfaction (odds ratio = 2.1, 95% confidence interval: 1.7, 2.7 from logistic regression on individuals; odds ratio = 3.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.7, 5.3 from conditional logistic regression on twin pairs discordant for life dissatisfaction), whereas life dissatisfaction did not consistently predict poor sleep. There was substantial heritability for both traits, but their shared genetic component was relatively weak, as indicated by genetic correlations of 0.21 for men and 0.27 for women in a multivariate genetic model. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that poor sleep may have direct effects on the brain, emotions, and mood.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of daytime cortisol activity has been associated with stress-related pathologies. Research suggests that early environmental adversity might shape cortisol activity. However, little is known about the genetic and environmental contributions to early cortisol and how this varies as a function of environmental circumstances. The goals of the study were to estimate the genetic and environmental contributions to daytime cortisol secretion in infant twins and to investigate whether these contributions varied as a function of familial adversity (FA).\nParticipants were 517 6-month-old twins. Salivary cortisol was collected when the infants woke up at home and in the morning, upon arrival at the laboratory. Familial adversity was defined by seven perinatal and postnatal risk factors: maternal smoking during pregnancy, low birth weight, low family income, low maternal education, single parenthood, young motherhood, and maternal hostile/reactive behaviors. Genetic and environment contributions to cortisol activity were estimated for high (three risk factors or more: 21.3% of the sample) versus low FA.\nGenetic factors accounted for cortisol levels in different ways: a moderate \"main effect\" of genes was found for home-based awakening cortisol, whereas the contribution of genes to morning cortisol was conditional to FA. Genetic factors accounted for most of the variance in morning cortisol in high family adversity but not in low family adversity.\nEarly FA modulates the heritability of morning cortisol in infants. The results are consistent with the diathesis-stress model, with genetic factors more likely to be expressed in adverse settings.",

    "abstract": "We studied twinning and fertility indices in mothers with spontaneous monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins and in mothers who conceived their twins after the use of assisted reproduction techniques (ART). Participants in this study consisted of 8,222 and 5,505 women with spontaneous DZ and MZ offspring and 4,164 and 250 women with ART DZ and MZ twin pairs, respectively. Women were compared with respect to the number of sibs and offspring, the presence of other relatives with twins and the time it took to conceive the twins. We also compared familial twinning between a younger and an older age group. Women with spontaneous DZ twins more often reported female relatives with twins than those with spontaneous MZ twins. The proportion of DZ versus MZ twin offspring in relatives was also larger in women with spontaneous DZ offspring than in women with MZ offspring. The first group of women reported a shorter time to conceive. Women with ART twins had fewer sibs and offspring and less often reported relatives with twins. We did not observe that DZ twinning was more familial in women who had their twins before age 36 years compared to older women. Familial DZ twinning is clearly present in mothers of spontaneous DZ twins. The mechanisms underlying spontaneous and non-spontaneous DZ twinning are different and fertility treatment should be taken into account in any study of twinning. Twinning is not more familial in women who have their twins at a younger age.",

Concordance among male twins for both of these cancers has never been reported. Although the family history suggested possible genetic predispositions to both cancers, the twins have no evidence of the genetic alterations associated with hereditary colorectal tumors.

    "abstract": "Two recent reports on recurrent cases of umbilical cord stricture (UCS) have opened the debate on the possibility of a genetic basis for this anomaly, traditionally considered to be sporadic. We present a series of 130 cases of UCS located at the fetal insertion, diagnosed among 2067 fetal and infantile autopsies performed during the last 10 years. All cases were macerated stillborn fetuses, and 54.6% were < or =20 weeks of gestational age. Our study is focused on 2 recurrent episodes and 16 cases occurring in multiple pregnancies. Among twins, males were affected more than females (2.2:1), although no statistical significance was found. Associated umbilical cord anomalies were present in 8 of 16 cases, consisting of hypocoiling (3 cases), hypercoiling (2 cases), excessive length (1 case), vascular tortuosity (1 case), and single umbilical artery (1 case). The most frequent placental finding was obliterative endovasculopathy (6 cases), probably indicating a causal relationship with UCS. Zygosity was analyzed by placental histology and/or a panel of 12 microsatellite markers to classify twins as monozygotic (8 cases) or dizygotic (8 cases). Our data prove that UCS is not a genetic condition because all 8 genetically identical twins were discordant for the anomaly and 2 dizygotic twins with UCS had co-twins also affected. Genetic factors are not implicated in UCS pathophysiology, and parents with a fetal demise due to UCS should be counseled as having a low-recurrence risk for subsequent pregnancies. Because there is not a higher incidence of UCS in multiple gestations, twinning should not be considered a risk factor for UCS.",

    "abstract": "In this study we analyzed the etiology of the relationship between personality traits and retrospectively recalled family environment. The data of 226 identical and 168 fraternal twin pairs reared together from the Jena twin study of social attitudes were available. Personality traits were measured using the self- and peer report versions of the German NEO-personality inventory-revised. A German version of Blocks Environmental Questionnaire was applied to measure two broad dimensions of the family environment retrospectively: support and organization. We could replicate earlier findings that retrospective reports of these family environment dimensions were in part genetically influenced. A total of 66% of the genetic variance in support and 24% in organization could be accounted for by heritable variance in self-rated personality. That was replicated by using peer reports of personality, 41% explained genetic variance in support and 17% in organization. Environmental mediations were negligible. This indicates that the relationship between personality and retrospectively recalled family environment is largely genetically mediated.",

    "abstract": "Colloid cysts of the third ventricle are rare benign tumors of endodermal origin accounting for 1% of all intracranial tumors. Interestingly, a few familial cases have been reported previously. We present the first case of dizygotic twins with a symptomatic colloid cyst of the third ventricle.\nA 10-year-old boy was admitted to a local hospital in 1993 because of severe progressive headache. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed acute obstructive hydrocephalus attributable to a third ventricular colloid cyst, which was removed after emergent ventricular drainage. Fourteen years later, a nonidentical twin brother complained of continuous headache with nausea and vomiting. A magnetic resonance imaging scan showed obstructive hydrocephalus and a third ventricle colloid cyst, which was removed by use of the transcallosal approach.\nBoth twins underwent complete removal of the cyst by the interhemispheric transcallosal approach without postoperative complications.\nOn the basis of a literature review, 2 cases of colloid cysts of the third ventricle in monozygotic twins and a few familial cases have been reported. Our case is the first in dizygotic twin brothers. These findings suggest that the prevalence of colloid cyst may be higher in twins than in the general population. We believe that the presence of this lesion in a twin necessitates magnetic resonance imaging of the other twin, and a clinical follow-up would be recommended in all other first-degree relatives.",

    "abstract": "Evidence on pregnancy outcomes of twins conceived by artificial reproductive technology (ART) compared with those naturally conceived (NC) is conflicting. We retrospectively audited outcomes of ART and NC twin births at Royal Maternity Hospital, Belfast from 01.01.2002-31.12.2003. Of 202 twins, 53 (26%) were ART and 149 (74%) were NC. ART group had increased maternal age (p < 0.001), more primiparous mothers (p < 0.001), used more peri-conceptual folic acid (p = 0.01), booked earlier for antenatal care (p < 0.05), delivered by caesarean section (p = 0.035) more often at a later gestation (p = 0.048) with a higher birth weight (p < 0.05). The NC group had increased congenital anomalies (p = 0.005) and babies requiring neonatal intensive care (p = 0.003). Of confirmed cases, ART twins were all dichorionic compared with 81.7% of NC (p = 0.002). Most neonatal outcome differences disappeared when NC dichorionic twins were compared with ART twins. ART twins have fewer complications than NC twins. Chorionicity accounts for most of these differences.",

    "abstract": "This study presents an extended children-of-twins model, which allowed the authors to test the direction of the association between parenting and child adjustment. Three mechanisms were examined: direct phenotypic influence of parenting on child behavior (controlling for both parental and child genotype), passive genotype-environment correlation, and evocative genotype-environment correlation. This model was tested with Monte Carlo simulations. The authors generated data sets consisting of 1,000 twin parent pairs together with their children and 1,000 twin children pairs together with their parents. These simulated data sets were then used to estimate the model, and the procedure was repeated 1,000 times. The simulation results showed that this model recovered the true values of parameters with high precision. The model was also applied to an observed data set to analyze, as a first example, the association between maternal emotional overinvolvement and child internalizing problems. The results showed that this association was best explained by evocative genotype-environment correlation.",

    "abstract": "The study investigated the genetic and environmental contributions to individual differences in measures of socioemotional reactivity and emotion regulation with a sample of 115 monozygotic (MZ) and 156 dizygotic (DZ) 5-month-old twin pairs. Twins' zygosity was determined by a combination of DNA typing and physical similarity. Twins' behaviors (motor activity level, social gaze, gaze aversion, positive expression, negative expression, and self-comfort) were videotaped in a laboratory while infants were presented televised sequences of neutral and happy emotional expressions posed by their mother (familiar condition) and a female stranger (unfamiliar condition). Regardless of the social context, the findings based on model-fitting analyses indicated that nonshared environmental influences explained most of the variance of behavioral data. However, there was evidence that motor activity level (an index of emotional arousal) and the latency and frequency of gaze aversion (an index of emotional regulation) were best represented by a model incorporating both additive genetic and nonshared environmental (i.e., AE) influences when infants were exposed to the unfamiliar adult (heritability estimates ranging from 19% to 31%). The results suggest the importance of nonshared environmental influences during early infancy and stress the role of social context for revealing moderate genetic contributions to individual differences in emotional arousal and emotion regulation.",

    "abstract": "We investigated patterns of cigarette smoking and Swedish snus (oral smokeless tobacco) use in a population-based sample of 19,073 Swedish twins 20-47 years old who participated in the baseline assessment of a prospective study of tobacco use and cessation in 2005-2006. Age-adjusted prevalence odds ratios (POR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI ) describe the association between tobacco use and sex, after adjustment for non-independence of twin pairs. Kaplan-Meier survival methods produced cumulative incidence curves of age at initiation of tobacco use. Slightly more than half of the baseline population was female (55.2%); the mean age at interview was 33.3 (+/-7.2) years and did not differ by sex. Having ever smoked daily was less common among males than females (11.9% vs. 15.3%; POR = 0.70 [0.64-0.77]), while having ever used snus daily was more common among males than females (31.1% vs. 4.8%; POR 11.7 [95% CI = 10.6-13.1]). The median age at initiation of smoking was 15 years for both sexes; median age at onset of snus use was 15 years for males and 18 years for females. Nicotine dependence scores were higher for males than females, and for current than former smokers. Findings from this study are in contrast to our previously published report on tobacco use among 32,123 Swedish twins 42-64 years old who completed a similar survey, and reported lower rates of snus use at later ages. Patterns of tobacco use may be changing in Sweden; snus use appears to be increasing, while daily smoking appears to be decreasing in popularity among the younger Swedish twins.",

    "abstract": "The authors tested the hypothesis that either prenatal feminization or masculinization hormone influences in utero or later socialization affects the risk for anorexia and bulimia nervosa and disordered eating in members of opposite-sex twin pairs.\nFinnish twins (N=2,426 women, N=1,962 men with known zygosity) from birth cohorts born 1974-1979 were assessed at age 22 to 28 years with a questionnaire for eating disorder symptoms. Based on the questionnaire screen, women (N=292), men (N=53), and their cotwins were interviewed to assess diagnoses of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa (per DSM-IV and broad criteria).\nIn women from opposite-sex twin pairs, the prevalence of DSM-IV or broad anorexia nervosa was not significantly different than that of women from monozygotic pairs or same-sex dizygotic pairs. Of the five male anorexia nervosa probands, only one was from an opposite-sex twin pair. Bulimia nervosa in men was too rare to be assessed by zygosity; the prevalence of DSM-IV or broad bulimia nervosa did not differ in women from opposite- versus same-sex twin pairs. In both sexes, the overall profile of indicators on eating disorders was rather similar between individuals from opposite- and same-sex pairs.\nThe authors found little evidence that the risk for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or disordered eating was associated with zygosity or sex composition of twin pairs, thus making it unlikely that in utero femininization or masculinization or socialization effects of growing up with an opposite-sex twin have a major influence on the later development of eating disorders.",

Of the five male anorexia nervosa probands, only one was from an opposite-sex twin pair. Bulimia nervosa in men was too rare to be assessed by zygosity; the prevalence of DSM-IV or broad bulimia nervosa did not differ in women from opposite- versus same-sex twin pairs. In both sexes, the overall profile of indicators on eating disorders was rather similar between individuals from opposite- and same-sex pairs.",

    "abstract": "To our knowledge, no prior twin studies have examined genetic and environmental contributions to the association of depressive symptoms and cigarette smoking in adolescence.\nGenetic and environmental contributions to the covariation of depressive symptoms and cigarette smoking were estimated among 287 monozygotic and 441 dizygotic adolescent twin pairs from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.\nDepressive symptoms were measured using an 18-item modified version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). Smoking involvement was defined using an ordinal scale based on smoking recency and frequency.\nDepressive symptoms and smoking were significantly correlated in both males and females. Twin modeling indicated that, in females, the correlation was attributable in part to common genetic factors and in part to environmental factors not shared among twins, or nonshared environment. In males, the correlation between depressive symptoms and smoking was solely attributable to nonshared environment.\nNonshared environmental correlations in males and females lend support to a direct causal relationship between depressive symptoms and smoking in adolescence. However, the additional common genetic vulnerability in females suggested that common genetic factors also contribute, particularly among adolescent females.",

    "abstract": "Dandy-Walker syndrome (DWS) is a developmental malformation of the central nervous system characterized by complete or partial absence of the cerebellar vermis, the presence of a posterior fossa cyst, and ventriculomegaly. Although DWS can be seen with Mendelian and chromosomal disorders, the actual pathophysiologic mechanism responsible for the syndrome is unknown. The incidence of DWS is approximately 1-8/100,000 births. We have noted a higher than expected incidence of DWS in a population of twins referred as complicated monochorionic twins, to include twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of DWS in monochorionic twins.\nThe database of all patients referred with complicated monochorionic twins was queried for the diagnosis of DWS. TTTS was defined sonographically as the combined presence of a maximum vertical pocket (MVP) of >or=8 cm in the recipient and <or=2 cm in the donor twin. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) was defined as <or=10(th) percentile for gestational age. DWS was diagnosed sonographically as partial or total absence of the cerebellar vermis, the presence of a posterior fossa cyst, and ventriculomegaly. Risk factors for DWS included fetal status (donor/small twin, recipient/large twin), TTTS stage, absent end-diastolic velocity in the umbilical artery (AEDV), and IUGR.\nThe data on 660 patients with monochorionic twin pregnancies were reviewed. DWS was seen in 10 (1.5%) patients (four TTTS, five IUGR, and one monoamniotic twin). The affected fetus was the smaller twin (donor or IUGR) in 8/10 cases (80%, p = 0.055, RR 1.64 (1.17-2.19)). DWS fetuses were more likely to be growth-restricted (7/10, 70% vs. 217/650, 33.4%, p = 0.03) than the non-DWS counterparts.\nThe incidence of DWS in complicated monochorionic twins is approximately 200 times higher than expected for singletons (p < 0.001). DWS is more likely to occur in the smaller twin of a twin pair and more likely to have growth restriction. These findings may assist in our understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the development of DWS.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been proposed as a biological endophenotype for affective disorders. In the present study the hypothesis that a high genetic liability to affective disorder is associated with higher cortisol levels was tested in a cross-sectional high-risk study. Healthy monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins with (High-Risk twins) and without (Low-Risk twins) a co-twin history of affective disorder were identified through nationwide registers. Awakening and evening salivary cortisol levels were compared between the 190 High- and Low-Risk twins. The 109 High-Risk twins had significantly higher evening cortisol levels than the 81 Low-Risk MZ twins, also after adjustment for age, sex, and the level of subclinical depressive symptoms. No significant difference was found in awakening cortisol levels between High-Risk and Low-Risk twins. In conclusion, a high genetic liability to affective disorder was associated with a higher evening cortisol level, but not with awakening cortisol level. Future prospective family, high-risk and twin studies are needed to decide whether abnormalities in the HPA axis can be identified as an endophenotype of affective disorder.",

However, it has not been previously described in monozygotic twins. Two children, approximately 1 year of age with CM-I and presumed episodes of pallid syncope or breath-holding spells presented for neurosurgical evaluation. Although Chiari decompression was considered, the authors decided to proceed with conservative management with close follow-up due to the uncertain nature of these episodes. Approximately 4 years later, both children's symptoms had resolved. Repeated MR imaging examinations also showed spontaneous resolution of the malformation in both girls. These cases emphasize that when patients with CM-I present with atypical symptoms, spontaneous resolution or improvement is possible, which may influence the decision to pursue a trial of nonsurgical management. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms and genetic influences of CM-I are also briefly discussed.",

    "abstract": "We examine the interaction between stressful life events (SLE) and genotypes for the length polymorphism of the serotonin receptor gene (5HTTLPR) on risk of depression. We hypothesize that if the interaction is real, monozygotic twin pairs (MZT) homozygous for the short allele (SS) will have a greater within pair variance in depression measures than MZT homozygous for the long allele (LL), as a reflection of their increased sensitivity to unknown environmental risk factors. Telephone interviews were used to assess symptoms of depression and suicidality on 824 MZT. Rather than using the interview items to calculate sum scores or allocate diagnostic classes we use Item Response Theory to model the contribution of each item to each individual's underlying liability to depression. SLE were also measured on the MZT assessed by mailed questionnaire on average 3.8 years previously, and these were used in follow-up analyses. We find no evidence for significant differences in within pair variance between 5HTTLPR genotypic classes and so can provide no support for interaction between these genotypes and the environment. The use of MZT provides a novel framework for examining genotype x environment interaction in the absence of measures on SLE.",

    "abstract": "To compare fetal cardiac output (CO) in donor and recipient twins of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) pregnancies after laser therapy with that of monochorionic twins without TTTS and normal singletons.\nIn a longitudinal, prospective study, we sonographically assessed fetal CO in donors (n = 10) and recipients (n = 10) with TTTS after fetoscopic laser therapy, in monochorionic twins without TTTS (n = 20) and in normal singleton pregnancies (n = 20). The fetal CO of TTTS twins was determined 1 day and 1 week after laser treatment, and from then on every 2-4 weeks until birth. Twins without TTTS were examined biweekly until birth. Singletons were examined twice, with an 8-week interval, at different gestational ages between 17 and 35 weeks.\nAbsolute CO increased exponentially with advancing gestational age (P < 0.0001), and was significantly related to fetal weight in all groups (P < 0.0001). The median CO/kg in donors after laser therapy, recipients after laser therapy and non-TTTS monochorionic twins was significantly higher than that in singletons (all P < 0.001). Median CO/kg in donors after laser therapy, recipients after laser therapy, and non-TTTS monochorionic twins was not significantly different between groups.\nMonochorionic twins with TTTS have higher CO after laser therapy than normal singletons.",

    "abstract": "In spite of the lack of evidence for its efficacy, and of sporadic reports of severe adverse events, codeine is still widely used as an antitussive agent in children. A 3-year-old boy (twin 1) was found lying in vomit and apnoeic at night; he was resuscitated and immediately transferred to our paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Two and a half hours later, his twin brother (twin 2) was found dead in his bed at home. Twin 1 required mechanical ventilation for 3 days, but he eventually made a full recovery; autopsy in twin 2 showed massive aspiration of gastric content. History revealed that the monozygotic twins had an upper respiratory tract infection for several days and had both been given codeine at a dose of \"10 drops per day\" by their mother. The blood of both twins was found to contain high levels of codeine and its metabolites. The weight of \"10 drops\" was determined experimentally and was found to range from 494 to 940 mg. Thus, the highest possible dose given by mother was 23.5 mg of codeine instead of the recommended 10 mg. The twins had identical CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms corresponding to the \"extensive metaboliser\" type.\nBecause of the variability of drop size drug dosage, dosage \"by drops\" is unprecise and may result in accidental overdose. The combination of repeated overdosing and extensive metabolism to morphine is likely to have caused apnoea in these twins. These cases illustrate the danger of codeine as an antitussive in young children.",

    "abstract": "It is estimated that there is at least a 2-fold rise in the incidence of monozygotic twinning after assisted reproductive technology compared with natural conception. This can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and SCISEARCH for studies that estimated the risk of monozygotic twinning and its association with any particular assisted reproductive technique. Monozygotic twinning was defined by ultrasound or Weinberg criteria. A meta-analysis of the proportion of monozygotic twins was performed using both fixed and random effects models.\nThe search revealed 37 publications reporting on the incidence of monozygotic twins after assisted reproductive techniques. Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The summary incidence of monozygotic twins after assisted conception was 0.9% (0.8-0.9%). The incidence of monozygotic twins in natural conception is 0.4%. Blastocyst transfer and intracytoplasmic sperm injection are associated with 4.25 and 2.25 times higher risk of monozygotic twins.\nThe risk of monozygotic twins in assisted conception is 2.25 times higher than the natural conceptions. Larger studies reporting on monozygotic twinning following single-embryo transfer or after post-natal confirmation of zygosity with DNA analysis are warranted before definitive conclusions can be drawn and guidelines produced. In order to provide adequate pre-conceptional counselling, it is important to monitor the incidence of monozygotic twins in both natural and assisted conceptions. We suggest building a national multiple pregnancy database based on accurate diagnosis of zygosity.",

The main aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of genetic factors on disability retirement due to the most common medical causes, including depressive disorders.\nThe study sample consisted of 24,043 participants (49.7% women) consisting of 11,186 complete same-sex twin pairs including 3519 monozygotic (MZ) and 7667dizygotic (DZ) pairs. Information on retirement events during 1.1.1975-31.12.2004, including disability pensions (DPs) with diagnoses, was obtained from the Finnish nationwide official pension registers. Correlations in liability for MZ and DZ twins and discrete time correlated frailty model were used to investigate the genetic liability to age at disability retirement.\nThe 30 year cumulative incidence of disability retirement was 20%. Under the best fitting genetic models, the heritability estimate for DPs due to any medical cause was 0.36 (95% CI 0.32-0.40), due to musculoskeletal disorders 0.37 (0.30-0.43), cardiovascular diseases 0.48 (0.39-0.57), mental disorders 0.42 (0.35-0.49) and all other reasons 0.24 (0.17-0.31). The effect of genetic factors decreased with increasing age of retirement. For DP due to depressive disorders, 28% of the variance was explained by environmental factors shared by family members (95% CI 21-36) and 58% of the variance by the age interval specific environmental factors (95% CI 44-71).\nA moderate genetic contribution to the variation of disability retirement due to any medical cause was found. The genetic effects appeared to be stronger at younger ages of disability retirement suggesting the increasing influence of environmental factors not shared with family members with increasing age. Familial aggregation in DPs due to depressive disorders was best explained by the common environmental factors and genetic factors were not needed to account for the pattern of familial aggregation.",

Risks for ND and AD were also due to genetic and unique environmental influences specific to each drug. A specific shared environmental factor contributed to CD.\nThese results suggest that the life-time co-occurrence of ND, AD and CD is due to common and specific genetic factors as well as unique environmental influences, and vulnerability for CD is also due to shared environmental factors that do not contribute to ND and AD. The majority of genetic variance is shared across drugs and the majority of unique environmental influences are drug-specific in these middle-aged men. Because differences between models allowing for specific genetic versus shared environment were small, we are most confident in concluding that there are specific familial contributions-either additive genetic or shared environment-to CD.",

    "abstract": "To explore the developmental relationships between early-onset depressive disorders and later use of addictive substances.\nA sample of 1545 adolescent twins was drawn from a prospective, longitudinal study of Finnish adolescent twins with baseline assessments at age 14 years and follow-up at age 17.5 years.\nAt baseline, DSM-IV diagnoses were assessed with a professionally administered adolescent version of Semi-Structured Assessment for Genetics of Alcoholism (C-SSAGA-A). At follow-up, substance use outcomes were assessed via self-reported questionnaire.\nEarly-onset depressive disorders predicted daily smoking [odds ratio (OR) 2.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49-3.50, P < 0.001], smokeless tobacco use (OR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.32-3.04, P = 0.001), frequent illicit drug use (OR = 4.71, 95% CI 1.95-11.37, P = 0.001), frequent alcohol use (OR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.04-3.92, P = 0.037) and recurrent intoxication (OR = 1.83, 95% CI 1.18-2.85, P = 0.007) 3 years later. ORs remained significant after adjustment for comorbidity and exclusion of baseline users. In within-family analysis of depression-discordant co-twins (analyses that control for shared genetic and familial background factors), early-onset depressive disorders at age 14 predicted significantly frequent use of smokeless tobacco and alcohol at age 17.5.\nOur results suggest important predictive associations between early-onset depressive disorders and addictive substance use, and these associations appear to be independent of shared familial influences.",

    "abstract": "Parents of monozygotic twins typically learn to recognise their own children and also to tell them apart on photographs. However, it is unknown whether such exemplar expertise can be generalised to unfamiliar faces of equal similarity (ie other twins). In the present study, parents of monozygotic twins were compared to 'control' parents whose children were non-twin siblings. In a same/different task with familiar and unfamiliar twin faces as stimuli, twins' parents were faster than control parents in distinguishing their own children, but slower when distinguishing unfamiliar twin faces. These unexpected findings can be interpreted as a generalisation of a habitual perceptual strategy that is efficient only with familiar face exemplars. When pictures of the twins' faces were inverted by 180degrees, the typical inversion costs for familiar faces were observed, but the twins' parents recognised unfamiliar twins' faces better when these were inverted than when upright. This inverted inversion effect could be caused by the high similarity of the face pairs as well as by experience with familiar faces of equally high similarity. We conclude that the facial expertise of twins' parents is idiosyncratic to their own children and not based on an enhanced general facial expertise.",

    "abstract": "Retinol-binding protein (RBP) 4 is an adipokine of which plasma levels are elevated in obesity and type 2 diabetes. The aims of the study were to identify determinants of plasma RBP4 and RBP4 mRNA expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and skeletal muscle and to investigate the association between RBP4 and in vivo measures of glucose metabolism.\nThe study population included 298 elderly twins (aged 62-83 years), with glucose tolerance ranging from normal to overt type 2 diabetes, and 178 young (aged 25-32 years) and elderly (aged 58-66 years) nondiabetic twins. Peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity was assessed by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, and beta-cell function was estimated from an intravenous glucose tolerance test.\nThe influence of environmental versus genetic factors in the regulation of plasma RBP4 increased with age. Plasma RBP4 was elevated in type 2 diabetes and increased with duration of disease. Plasma RBP4 correlated inversely with peripheral, but not hepatic, insulin sensitivity. However, the association disappeared after correction for covariates, including plasma adiponectin. Plasma retinol, and not RBP4, was inversely associated with insulin secretion. SAT RBP4 expression correlated positively with GLUT4 expression and inversely with glucose tolerance. Skeletal muscle RBP4 expression reflected intramuscular fat, and although it was suppressed by insulin, no association with insulin sensitivity was evident. RBP4 expression was not associated with circulatory RBP4.\nIn conclusion, our data indicate that RBP4 levels in plasma, skeletal muscle, and fat may be linked to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in a secondary and noncausal manner.",

    "abstract": "Human brain development is created through continuing complex interactions of genetic and environmental influences. The challenge of linking specific genetic or environmental risk factors to typical or atypical behaviors has led to interest in using brain structural features as an intermediate phenotype. Twin studies in adults have found that many aspects of brain anatomy are highly heritable, demonstrating that genetic factors provide a significant contribution to variation in brain structures. Less is known about the relative impact of genes and environment while the brain is actively developing. We summarize results from the ongoing National Institute of Mental Health child and adolescent twin study that suggest that heritability of different brain areas changes over the course of development in a regionally specific fashion. Areas associated with more complex reasoning abilities become increasingly heritable with maturation. The potential mechanisms by which gene-environment interactions may affect heritability values during development is discussed.",

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are a group of common congenital malformations of the brain and spine generated during neurulation. The genetic basis of this process is still not well known. Whenever an NTD is diagnosed in one of a pair of twins, the other twin should also be evaluated for NTDs.",

    "abstract": "Lummaa et al. (2007) presented historical data collected from twins born in Finland between 1734 and 1888 which suggested that females (N = 31) born as part of an opposite sex (OS) twin pair were 25% less likely to reproduce than female twins (N = 35) born as part of a same sex (SS) pair. They hypothesized that this reduction in fitness was due to masculinization of the female fetus via prenatal effects of the hormones of a male fetus. Because such masculinization would presumably take place in modern populations as well, it would seem important to establish to what degree it does so, and if so, whether reproduction is affected. We therefore address the question of reproduction differences in individual female twins from same-sex (N = 1979) and opposite-sex (N = 913) dizygotic pairs in studies carried out in Australia, the Netherlands, and the United States. In all three samples, there were no differences in the number of children or age of first pregnancies in women from same sex pairs compared to those from opposite sex pairs. Similarly, there were no differences in psychological femininity between women from pairs of the same or opposite sex.",

    "abstract": "Deriving their name from the Greek word plastikos, meaning related to molding, plastic surgeons have made their reputation by transplanting tissues from one area of the body to another to \"remold\" defects caused by trauma, congenital anomaly, or disease. Dr. Joseph Murray, a plastic surgeon, performed the first successful kidney transplant between identical twins in 1954. The authors present three cases involving the transplantation of perforator flaps from one identical twin to another for breast reconstruction, including cases using both deep inferior epigastric perforator and superficial inferior epigastric artery flaps.\nThree sets of recipient monozygotic twins that had breasts treated with mastectomies underwent reconstruction using transplanted tissue from their donor monozygotic twins. All sets of twins underwent DNA testing to determine that they were monozygotic; therefore, no immunosuppressive therapy was indicated.\nThe three sets of recipient monozygotic twins underwent successful breast reconstruction using perforator flap transplants from their donor monozygotic twins. The operations included two unilateral reconstructions (one using a deep inferior epigastric perforator flap and the other using a superficial inferior epigastric artery flap) and one bilateral deep inferior epigastric perforator reconstruction. Their hospital courses were unremarkable.\nTransplant surgery continues to evolve in the twenty-first century. The authors present three cases of breast reconstruction using skin flap transplantation as a new option for breast reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "To study the placental angioarchitecture of monochorionic placentas with and without twin anemia-polycythemia sequence.\nEligible were all placentas from monochorionic twin gestations, not complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome and resulting in double survival. The study was conducted at two European Fetal Therapy Centers between 2002 and 2008. Placental angioarchitecture was evaluated using colored dye injection. Diagnosis of twin anemia-polycythemia sequence was based on the presence of large intertwin hemoglobin difference without the degree of amniotic fluid discordance that is required for the diagnosis of twin transfusion syndrome.\nThree-hundred thirteen monochorionic twin pregnancies were eligible for the study but placental data could not be completed for 62 placentas (20%). This left 251 monochorionic twin pregnancies of which 11 (4%) fulfilled the criteria for twin anemia-polycythemia sequence. The median number of anastomoses in monochorionic placentas with and without twin anemia-polycythemia sequence was 3 (range: 2-5) and 7 (range: 0-25), respectively (P<.001). Small anastomoses were present in 91% (10/11) of twin anemia-polycythemia sequence-placentas compared with 5% (12/240) of cases without twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (P<.001).

Urine osmolality below that of the plasma suggested GDI. 1-deamino-8D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) treatment was started with a quick response. GDI is probably the result of excessive activity of placental vasopressinase. In cases of liver dysfunction, the clearance rate of vasopressinase decreases, explaining the association of GDI with acute fatty liver and HELLP syndrome.

Flow-volume spirometry, followed by isocapnic hyperventilation of cold air, was performed at the ages of 8-16 and 14-22 years in 1993 and 1999. Wilcoxon's matched-pairs analysis was used to compare smaller and larger twin pairs.\nIn 1993, there were no significant differences between the groups in either spirometry or cold air challenge. In 1999, such a difference was found in forced expiratory volume % (FEV%) and forced expiratory flow (FEF) at 25%-75%, the smaller twin pairs having lower values. In 1993, nine subjects reacted to cold air (>9% decrease in FEV in 1 second). In 1999, only four subjects reacted to cold air, and they all belonged to the group of smaller twins (P=0.04).\nLung function evaluated by FEV% and FEF25-75 was lower and responses to cold air were more common at the median age of 16 years in twins with impaired intrauterine growth.",

    "abstract": "To determine how genetic and environmental contributions affecting the number of psychoactive substances used varies with age and gender over the course of adolescence.\nEstimates of genetic, shared environmental and non-shared environmental contributions to total variance in diversity of substances used at ages 11, 14 and 17 years were obtained by fitting a multivariate behavior genetic (Cholesky) model.\nA total of 711 male and 675 female twins.\nParticipants reported whether they had used each of 11 substances.\nThe average diversity of substances used increased over time for both males and females, and males generally reported a wider diversity of substances used than females. Influences of genetic factors increased with age and were greater for males than for females at ages 14 and 17 years. Genetic factors remained consistent (i.e. highly correlated) across ages for both males and females, as did shared environmental influences for males. Non-shared environmental factors for both sexes and females' shared environmental factors were age-specific.\nRegardless of sex, the proportion of variance in substances used attributable to genetic factors increases during adolescence, although it is greater for males than females at later ages. These findings indicate that prevention interventions may be most effective if they target early adolescence when environmental factors account for the majority of variance in substance use. The high correlation of genetic factors across ages suggests that early use may sometimes signal an early expression of a developmentally stable genetic predisposition.",

    "abstract": "Previous twin studies have shown strong heritability of electroencephalogram amplitude characteristics, such as power spectra. However, it has been suggested that these high heritabilities may reflect \"trivial\" twin resemblance in intervening tissues such as the skull. Here we demonstrate strong monozygotic twin correlation (0.79 < r < 0.88) of eyes-closed resting-state magnetoencephalogram power, which is insensitive to intervening tissues. These results confirm that brain activity itself is highly heritable.",

    "abstract": "We report two sets of parasitic twins attached in the thoracic region. Exomphalos major in the autosite was present in both cases. While in case 1, the autosite could be salvaged after easier dissection, in case 2, the autosite could not be salvaged due to the presence of the life-threatening anomalies. The presence of a right-angled communication between the gastrointestinal tracts of the autosite and the independent tactile responses of the parasite from that in the autosite supports the 'fusion theory' to explain the fusion of the embryos that could have led to this defect. The presence of the ano-rectal malformation and common bile duct dilatation exclusively in the parasite appears to be the result of the abnormalities in the endodermal-mesodermal interactions, probably due to the relative positioning of the parasite with respect to the autosite.",

We used an identical-twin, case-control design to investigate whether these abnormalities reflect pre-trauma vulnerability or the acquired consequence of PTSD. Vietnam combat veterans and their non-combat-exposed, identical twins completed a three-tone oddball task. Veterans with PTSD had delayed target N2 latencies compared to veterans without PTSD. In a small nonmedicated, nonsmoking subsample, veterans with PTSD also had significantly diminished target P3b amplitudes. A mixed-model, random-effects analysis on the nonmedicated, nonsmoking subsample that included the combat-unexposed co-twins showed a significant Diagnosis x Combat Exposure interaction for target P3b amplitude. Results replicate increased N2 latency and diminished P3b amplitude in PTSD and suggest that diminished P3b amplitude is an acquired condition in PTSD.",

    "abstract": "In this large population-based twin study, a self-estimated impaired balance, an important risk factor for osteoporotic fractures, had a modest heritability of 0.27. Individual-specific environmental influences seem to be the dominating cause for impaired balance.\nThe principal causal components of an osteoporotic fracture are falls and weakened bone strength. While bone strength has a strong genetic origin, the heritable influences on impaired balance that contribute to the risk of injurious falls at older age are uncertain.\nTo evaluate the heritability and environmental influence on self-reported impaired balance in older men and women, we used data from a sample of 22,998 Swedish twins, 55 to 99 years of age.\nAn impaired balance was reported by 2,890 (12.3%) of the twins. The tetrachoric correlation for impaired balance was only slightly lower for like-sex dizygotic twins (0.31) compared to monozygotic twins (0.36). These correlations indicate a modest familial (genetic and shared environmental) influence. Model fitting results indicate that the age- and sex-adjusted heritability for impaired balance was 0.27 (95%CI = 0.01-0.45). Individual-specific environmental influences differed only slightly by sex and age.\nThese results imply that a self-reported impaired balance, an independent risk factor for osteoporotic fractures, has a modestly heritable etiology in older subjects. Our observation can partly explain the previously observed modest heritability for osteoporotic fractures even though there is a high heritability for bone mineral density.",

    "abstract": "There have been indications that intrauterine and early extrauterine growth can influence childhood mental and motor function. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of intrauterine growth restriction and early extrauterine head growth on the neurodevelopmental outcome of monozygotic twins. Thirty-six monozygous twin pairs were evaluated at the corrected age of 12 to 42 months. Intrauterine growth restriction was quantified using the fetal growth ratio. The effects of birth weight ratio, head circumference at birth and current head circumference on mental and motor outcomes were estimated using mixed-effect linear regression models. Separate estimates of the between (interpair) and within (intrapair) effects of each measure on development were thus obtained. Neurodevelopment was assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd edition, by a psychologist blind to the exposure. A standardized neurological examination was performed by a neuropediatrician who was unaware of the exposures under investigation. After adjustment, birth weight ratio and head circumference at birth were not associated with motor or mental outcomes. Current head circumference was associated with mental but not with motor outcomes. Only the intrapair twin effect was significant. An increase of 1 cm in current head circumference of one twin compared with the other was associated with 3.2 points higher in Mental Developmental Index (95%CI = 1.06-5.32; P < 0.03). Thus, no effect of intrauterine growth was found on cognition and only postnatal head growth was associated with cognition. This effect was not shared by the co-twin.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, is one of the most common autosomal recessive diseases in Caucasians. We screened for the CFTR gene mutation in a Caucasian father with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), a Taiwanese mother, and twins resulting from an intracytoplasmic single sperm injection (ICSI) procedure. DNA fragments that showed abnormal banding patterns on temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis analysis followed by analysis of DNA sequence was used. The Caucasian father with CBAVD had _F508 and p.L375F mutations. The two children were heterozygous for the _F508 and p.L375F mutations, respectively. Mutation analysis of the CFTR gene should always be recommended for infertile couples seeking ICSI. The possibility of the children resulting from ICSI being a victim or carrier of CBAVD or CF, especially when the father is Caucasian with CBAVD, should be discussed during genetic counseling.",

    "abstract": "Genetic factors have a considerable influence on serum thyroid hormone levels. The C785T and A1814G polymorphisms, located in the 3' untranslated region of the type 1 deiodinase (D1) gene have been associated with serum FT4 and rT3 levels.\nIn healthy Danish twins, we examined the association of these polymorphisms with serum thyroid hormone levels and determined the proportion of genetic influence explained by these variants. We analysed the underlying functional mechanism by performing mRNA stability measurements and analysed the effect of these variants on D1 activity.\nSerum thyroid measurements and genotypes of the D1-C785T and D1-A1814G polymorphisms were determined in 1192 twins. Structural equation modelling was used to determine heritability estimates. Functional analyses were carried out in D1-transfected JEG3 cells.\nCarriers of the D1-785T allele had 3.8% higher FT4 and 14.3% higher rT3 levels, resulting in a lower T3/T4 and T3/rT3 ratio and a higher rT3/T4 ratio. This polymorphism explained 0.87% and 1.79%, respectively, of the variation in serum FT4 and rT3. The D1-A1814G polymorphism was not associated with serum thyroid hormone levels. No differences in D1 mRNA decay rate or D1 activity were observed between wild-type D1 and the two variants.\nThe D1-C785T polymorphism is consistently and significantly associated with serum thyroid hormone levels. However, the proportion of genetic influence explained by this particular polymorphism is small. No effect of the polymorphism on D1 mRNA decay rate or D1 activity was observed. The underlying functional mechanism needs to be elucidated.",

Monozygotic twins with congenital systemic juvenile xanthogranuloma who presented with multiple skin lesions, hepatosplenomegaly, liver failure, and bone marrow involvement were reported. The diagnosis of systemic juvenile xanthogranuloma was confirmed by histology and immunohistochemical stains of the skin with liver biopsies revealing dense infiltration of lymphohistiocytes with typical Touton giant cells staining positive for CD68 and negative for CD1a and S-100 protein. Both of them received systemic prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day which was gradually tapered off with time according to clinical and investigative responses.

    "abstract": "To summarize our preliminary experience of selective feticide with bipolar coagulation in complicated monochorionic twins (MCT), and discuss the clinical application of feticide in discordant MCT.\nThree MCT with one twin anomaly, in which 2 had severe twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), stage IV, and 1 had acardiac twin, were identified in the second trimester of pregnancy. To terminate the abnormal twin and isolate the co-twin's circulation completely, selective feticide was performed by umbilical cord occlusion with bipolar coagulation under guidance of ultrasound and fetoscopy. After each invasive procedure, serial monitoring was performed, including procedural complications, Doppler of fetal middle cerebral artery and umbilical artery. Pregnancies were followed up every 2 weeks for fetal growth until delivery. After birth the placentas and the terminated fetuses were examined.\nCord occlusion was successfully accomplished in all 3 targeted fetuses, at 21, 22 and 24 weeks of gestation respectively. One case with TTTS was complicated with rupture of the membrane in the terminated fetus the 7th day after the procedure, and a healthy baby was born at 32 weeks. The other case with TTTS delivered a boy by cesarean section at 38 weeks. The third case with TRAP is at 35 weeks of gestations and under regular follow-up. Monochorionicity was confirmed by placental examination after delivery, and the effects of bipolar coagulation were observed at the cord of terminated fetuses.\nUmbilical cord occlusion with bipolar coagulation is an effective procedure for selective feticide in MCT with one twin anomaly. The outcome of normal fetus can be favorable.",

    "abstract": "We examined deliveries of twins to identify factors most strongly associated with an increased risk of transfusion. We reviewed the obstetric records of 511 twin deliveries at the Japanese Red Cross Katsushika Maternity Hospital from 2003 through 2007. After 18 (3.5%) of these deliveries, transfusions were required. Transfusion was significantly more likely after elective cesarean delivery at a gestational aged of 37 weeks or more (odds ratio, 4.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.87-12.61). Emergency cesarean delivery (at > or =37 weeks' gestation) was not associated with an increased risk of transfusion. The delivery mode of twins should be carefully considered because of the increased risk of transfusion after elective cesarean delivery at a gestational age of 37 weeks or more.",

    "abstract": "Twin studies are useful for investigating the causes of trait variation between as well as within a population. The goals of the present study were two-fold: First, we aimed to compare the total phenotypic, genetic and environmental variances of height, weight and BMI between Caucasians and East Asians using twins. Secondly, we intended to estimate the extent to which genetic and environmental factors contribute to differences in variability of height, weight and BMI between Caucasians and East Asians.\nHeight and weight data from 3735 Caucasian and 1584 East Asian twin pairs (age: 13-15 years) from Australia, China, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States were used for analyses. Maximum likelihood twin correlations and variance components model-fitting analyses were conducted to fulfill the goals of the present study.\nThe absolute genetic variances for height, weight and BMI were consistently greater in Caucasians than in East Asians with corresponding differences in total variances for all three body measures. In all 80 to 100% of the differences in total variances of height, weight and BMI between the two population groups were associated with genetic differences.\nHeight, weight and BMI were more variable in Caucasian than in East Asian adolescents. Genetic variances for these three body measures were also larger in Caucasians than in East Asians. Variance components model-fitting analyses indicated that genetic factors contributed to the difference in variability of height, weight and BMI between the two population groups. Association studies for these body measures should take account of our findings of differences in genetic variances between the two population groups.",

    "abstract": "Parenting twins is typically portrayed as more stressful than is parenting single children and, therefore, more of a strain on the marital relationship. With this in mind, the present study examined the contribution of infant characteristics and mother's internal resources (attachment style) and external resources (maternal and paternal grandmothers' perceived support) to their marital adaptation during the first month following delivery, comparing mothers of twins (n = 88) with mothers of singletons (n = 82). The findings indicate that both internal and external resources contribute to the marital adaptation of the two groups, even beyond the contribution of specific circumstances. Thus, it seems that the birth of twins and the birth of a single child are normative life events that have more in common than previously acknowledged. The implications for the focus of social work interventions, particularly in the case of the birth of twins, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Down syndrome detection rate at a 5% screen positive rate in first-trimester screening for twins.\nThis was a retrospective study from August 2005 to July 2007 of twins who underwent first-trimester screening with nuchal translucency, nasal bone, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, and free beta-hCG. Risks were calculated on the basis of the Fetal Medicine Foundation twin algorithm. The model simulated distributions of unaffected and affected cases at 12 weeks of gestation.\nTwo thousand ninety-four twin pregnancies (4188 fetuses) met the inclusion criteria. The addition of nasal bone to nuchal translucency, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, and free beta-hCG increased the Down syndrome detection rate from 79-89% at a 5% screen-positive rate.\nIn twins, first-trimester screening with nasal bone is valuable. The improved Down syndrome detection rate can help these high-risk patients with the decision-making process of whether to pursue invasive testing with its associated pregnancy loss risk.",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in parenting behaviors are due, in part, to genetic factors. In the present study, the authors sought to determine whether the degree of genetic influence varied according to the type of parental behavior under consideration. A population-based sample of 2,334 pairs of Finnish twins provided ratings on the physical affection, control, abusiveness, and indifference shown by their father and mother during childhood. Genetic influences, shared environmental influences, and nonshared environmental influences accounted for a small-to-medium proportion (17%-30%), a small-to-large proportion (22%-44%), and a medium-to-large proportion (37%-55%) of the variance in each parenting measure, respectively. There were no significant differences in effect sizes for mothers and fathers or across the 4 types of parental behavior. The genetic results may reflect characteristic styles with which parents respond to genetically influenced behaviors of individuals (gene-environment correlations) or individual perceptions of this relationship (gene-person correlation processes). The findings have implications for intervention and prevention work with families and for interpretation of evidence for interactions between genes and parenting behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is a harmful disease factor that develops unnoticed over time. The treatment of hypertension is aimed at an early diagnosis followed by adequate lifestyle changes rather than pharmacological treatment. The olive leaf extract EFLA943, having antihypertensive actions in rats, was tested as a food supplement in an open study including 40 borderline hypertensive monozygotic twins. Twins of each pair were assigned to different groups receiving 500 or 1000 mg/day EFLA943 for 8 weeks, or advice on a favourable lifestyle. Body weight, heart rate, blood pressure, glucose and lipids were measured fortnightly. Blood pressure changed significantly within pairs, depending on the dose, with mean systolic differences of < or =6 mmHg (500 mg vs control) and < or =13 mmHg (1000 vs 500 mg), and diastolic differences of < or =5 mmHg. After 8 weeks, mean blood pressure remained unchanged from baseline in controls (systolic/diastolic: 133 +/- 5/77 +/- 6 vs 135 +/- 11/80 +/- 7 mmHg) and the low-dose group (136 +/- 7/77 +/- 7 vs 133 +/- 10/76 +/- 7), but had significantly decreased for the high dose group (137 +/- 10/80 +/- 10 vs 126 +/- 9/76 +/- 6). Cholesterol levels decreased for all treatments with significant dose-dependent within-pair differences for LDL-cholesterol. None of the other parameters showed significant changes or consistent trends. Concluding, the study confirmed the antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering action of EFLA943 in humans.",

A well-conducted twin study is an excellent means to assess the relative contribution of heritability and environmental factors.\nMultiple sclerosis concordance was assessed for 10 Monozygotic and 14 dizygotic twin pairs using pairwise and probandwise concordance rates. The tetrachoric correlations in liability to disease for twin pairs were computed and a polygenic multifactorial model was used to estimate heritability.\nThe pairwise concordance for MZ twins was 30% and for the DZ twins 14.3%, compared with 30% for MZ and 0% for DZ 20 years ago. The corresponding probandwise concordance rates were 46.2% and 25%. The genetic variance (heritability) was 15.3% (95% Cl 0.0-77.6), the common environmental variance 73.7% (95% Cl 14.1-93.9) and the unique environmental variance 11.1% (95% Cl 2.3-30.0).\nAs the concordance of MS in DZ twins has increased during the past two decades and the heritability estimate is low, it seems that the reported increase in MS incidence in Finland is mainly caused by environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the potential for gene x environment interaction in hypertension by examining the extent to which educational attainment modifies the heritability of hypertension in male twins. Prior twin and family studies have established that hypertension runs in families and is heritable. In addition, epidemiological research indicates that the prevalence of hypertension differs by socioeconomic factors, such as educational attainment.\nTwin structural equation modeling was used to examine educational attainment as a moderator of heritability of hypertension. Participants were 4301 monozygotic and 3414 dizygotic male Vietnam-era twins who provided data on both education (in years) and self-report of physician diagnosis of hypertension or medication usage.\nHeritability was 17 points lower among co-twins concordant for educational attainment of < or =14 years (0.46, 95% CI = 0.32-0.57) relative to co-twins concordant for >14 years of education (0.63, 95% CI = 0.54-0.71). The significant moderation of the heritability (p = .04) was confirmed in twin models examining educational attainment as a continuous moderator of hypertension.\nThese results demonstrate that the expression of genetic vulnerability to hypertension can vary as a function of environmental factors, including education level, and that nongenetic pathways may differentially contribute to risk among those with fewer years of education.",

    "abstract": "Despite intense research, etiologies underlying syndromic craniosynostosis remain poorly understood. While syndrome-related genetic factors have garnered much attention, external forces likely play a large role as well. In contrast to well-defined genetic abnormalities that may be precisely identified and statistically quantified, characterization of more environmental factors has proven difficult. Much of this challenge stems from difficulty in isolating genetic components. However, in the event that 2 individuals share similar genetics, a clearer picture of external factors impacting phenotypic differences may be drawn. Because monozygotic discordant twins have identical genomes, the differences between affected and unaffected members are the result of the environment. Here, we discuss identical twin females who presented with Crouzon syndrome, as well as variations in craniosynostosis. In addition to highlighting the impact of nongenetic factors on craniosynostosis phenotype, we review several environmental elements that may have played a role in this unusual case.",

    "abstract": "Utilising data derived from twins and their families, different approaches can be applied to study genetic and environmental influences on human dental variation. The different methods have advantages and limitations and special features of the twinning process are important to consider. Model-fitting approaches have shown that different combinations of additive genetic variance (A), non-additive genetic variance (D), common environmental variance (C), and unique environmental variance (E) contribute to phenotypic variation within the dentition, reflecting different ontogenetic and phylogenetic influences. Epigenetic factors are also proposed as important in explaining differences in the dentitions of monozygotic co-twins. Heritability estimates are high for most tooth size variables, for Carabelli trait and for dental arch dimensions, moderate for intercuspal distances, and low for some occlusal traits. In addition to estimating the contributions of unmeasured genetic and environmental influences to phenotypic variation, structural equation models can also be used to test the effects of measured genetic and environmental factors. Whole-genome linkage analysis, association analysis of putative candidate genes, and whole genome association approaches, now offer exciting opportunities to locate key genes involved in human dental development.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative genetic studies revealed that not all of the phenotypic variance in PTC taste perception is heritable.\nTo study quantitative variations in PTC tasting ability in twins and to estimate heritability of PTC taste perception on the taste of twin data on males and females sexes separately.\nThe data for PTC taste sensitivity following the classic method of Harris & Kalmus (1949) were collected on a sample of 141 twin pairs (66 MZ and 75 DZ) and 275 singletons (128 males and 147 females) from Chandigarh, India. Genetic analyses were performed following Christian (1979), Donner (1986) and Sham (1998).\nFrequency of non-tasters was similar in twins (33 %) and singletons (32 %), but significant sex differences were observed. No differences were found between zygosities for mean thresholds. Similarly, no evidence of variance heterogeneity and environmental covariance was seen between zygosities. Since no basic assumption of the twin method was found violated, within-pair estimates of genetic variance would be unbiased. These estimates were highly significant in both males and females. However, dominance and additive components of genetic variance were found to differ between sexes.\nPTC thresholds do not seem to be significantly affected by environmental factors as no variance inequality was observed between twin zygosities. Intensity of bitterness (scalar dimensions) of PTC is a separate trait having no commonality with the genetic basis of recognition threshold for PTC tasting ability. The receptors recognizing bitter taste are different from the receptors determining intensity of taste. The absolute difference between co-twins in PTC thresholds can be used as a simple tool in the twin zygosity diagnosis. The results show that none of the MZ co-twins had manifested difference of more than 3 in their PTC threshold.",

    "abstract": "Treatment studies suggest that gambling-related irrational beliefs and attitudes (i.e., cognitive distortions (CDs)) contribute to the risk for problem gambling behavior. In a community sample of men, we investigated the associations among lifetime gambling-related CDs, psychiatric disorders other than pathological gambling , and problem gambling severity. Subjects were 1354 members of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Problem gambling and gambling-related CDs were derived from a 2002 interview using the National Opinion Research Center DSM-IV Screen for Gambling Problems (NODS). Exploratory factor analysis was performed with the 12 CD items to identify an underlying construct. Generalized linear models were computed to test for associations among CDs, psychiatric disorders other than pathological gambling, and gambling problem severity. Co-twin control analyses of monozygotic twin pairs discordant for problem gambling severity adjusted for genetic and shared environmental influences. Twelve CD items related to one underlying CD construct. After adjustment for lifetime psychiatric disorders, pathological gambling symptoms were positively associated with higher CD scores. Pathological gambling symptoms remained significantly associated with CD scores after controlling for genetic and shared environmental influence. These results provide empirical support for an association between gambling-related CDs and gambling problem severity, even after controlling for genetic and shared environmental influences and non-pathological gambling psychiatric disorders. Public health messages and therapeutic interventions that reinforce the randomness of gambling and draw attention to distorted thinking may prevent the development of problem gambling and improve treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is characterized by growth failure and dysmorphic features, and is frequently caused by hypomethylation of the paternally derived H19-DMR (epimutation). We observed 5 8/12-year-old female twins discordant for SRS. One twin exhibited SRS-compatible features, such as pre- and postnatal growth failure, relative macrocephaly, triangular face, left hemihypotrophy, and bilateral fifth finger clinodactyly, whereas the other twin showed apparently normal phenotype. Microsatellite analysis for 26 loci on multiple chromosomes showed monozygosity. Methylation analysis for the H19-DMR indicated epimutation in roughly half of cells in the affected twin and normal patterns in the unaffected twin and the parents. X-inactivation analysis revealed random X-inactivation with a nearly identical pattern between the twins. The discordant methylation pattern of the H19-DMR may primarily be due to a failure to maintain the DNA methyltransferase-1-dependent methylation imprint around the pre-implantation S phase, because such failure would result in the production of two different cell clones, one with normally methylated DMR and the other with demethylated DMR, leading to the separation of cells with different characters and resultant twinning.",

    "abstract": "A 29-year-old healthy woman bore monozygotic male twins at 37 weeks of gestation by cesarean section. They weighed 2,350 and 2,140 g, respectively. Twin B was found to have a ventricular septal defect. They were diagnosed with esophageal atresia (EA) with tracheoesophageal fistula and underwent primary end-to-end esophageal anastomosis at the age of 1 day. Their postoperative courses were uneventful. Although the incidence of EA is higher in twins than in singletons, usually, EA affects only one of twins. There have been only 20 pairs of twins concordant for the EA anomaly. There is no distinct difference between sporadic EA and EA in both twins (EABT) with regard to sexuality, classification, and incidence of associated anomalies. The zygosity of EABT consisted of 15 monozygosities (83.3%) and 3 dizygosities (16.7%). An overwhelmingly higher incidence of monozygosity than that of dizygosity in EABT suggests that genetic factors must play a considerable role in the embryology in EABT cases.",

    "abstract": "Genetic risk factors contribute considerably to both clinical affective disorders and subsyndromal mood level. There is moreover evidence to suggest that the genetic basis of bipolar disorder and unipolar depression overlap to some extent, and several linkage analyses have suggested evidence for a common susceptibility locus in affective disorders on chromosome 12q24. In this study we investigated the chromosome 12 candidate region for linkage to the mean level of depression symptomatology, over a 10-year follow-up, using a highly informative sample of concordant and discordant twin pairs selected from 4,731 participants of the Longitudinal Study of Ageing Danish Twins. Our results showed suggestive evidence of linkage to this region with a peak LOD score of 1.91 for marker D12S1634 located at 148 cM, and thus indicates that the previously identified disease locus at 12q24 is also a general vulnerability locus affecting the normal range of mood.",

    "abstract": "To describe an efficient, generalizable approach to validate probabilistic record linkage results, in particular by a model-guided detection of linking errors, and to apply this approach to validate linkage of admissions of newborns.\nOur double-blind validation procedure consisted of three steps: sample selection, data collection and data analysis. The linked Dutch national newborn admission registry contained 30,082 records for 2001 including readmissions (7.4%) and twins (9.7%). A highly informative sample was selected from the linked file by oversampling uncertain links based on model-derived linking weight. Four hundred and eight fax forms with minimal registry information (admissions of 191 children) were sent out to different pediatric units. The pediatricians were asked to create a short detailed patient history from independent sources. The linkage status and additional record data was validated against this external information.\nResponse rate was 97% (395/408 faxes). Accuracy of the linkage of singleton admissions was high: except for some expected errors in the uncertain area (0.02% of record pairs), linkage was error-free. Validation of multiple birth readmissions showed 37% linkage errors due to low data quality of the multiple birth variables. The quality of the linked registry file was still high; only 1.7% of the children were from a multiple birth with multiple admissions, resulting in less than 1% linking error.\nOur external validation procedure of record linkage was feasible, efficient, and informative about identifying the source of the errors.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) risk is determined by both genes and environment. One of the most striking features of MS is its geographic distribution, particularly the pattern of high MS frequency in areas with low sunlight exposure, the main inducer of vitamin D synthesis. Recent epidemiologic, experimental, and clinical evidence support an effect for low environmental supplies of vitamin D in mediating an increased susceptibility to MS.\nWe 1) examined the association of serum 25-hydroxy-vitaminD [25(OH)D] concentrations and MS status and 2) assessed the genetic contribution to serum 25(OH)D concentrations and tested for its association with genetic variants in 2 candidate genes [vitamin D receptor and 1-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1)].\nWe used a twin study approach, comprising adult pairs identified from the longitudinal population-based Canadian Collaborative Project on Genetic Susceptibility to MS. Monozygotic (MZ; n = 40) and dizygotic (DZ; n = 59) pairs, both concordant and discordant for MS, were studied. End-of-winter serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay, and genotypes were assessed by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay.\nSerum concentrations of 25(OH)D were highly correlated in MS-concordant pairs (r = 0.83, P < 0.001), but they were not significantly associated with having the disease (P = 0.4) when analyzed by logistic regression. Intraclass correlation for 25(OH)D concentration was significantly greater in MZ pairs (MZ, r: 0.71 > DZ r: 0.32, P = 0.006). Significant associations of 2 CYP27B1 SNP variants and 25(OH)D concentrations were observed.\nThe findings indicate important genetic influences on regulation of seasonal circulating 25(OH)D concentrations in MS twins.",

    "abstract": "Low birthweights as well as high perinatal mortality rates are common in most African populations. Little is known, however, about how low birthweight corresponds with higher mortality rates within African populations. Twins are known to have lower birthweights and higher perinatal mortality rates than singletons. If lower birthweights represent higher perinatal risk per se, small twins within a population with generally lower birthweights should have critically increased risks.\nIn total, 15,255 births in a Tanzanian hospital during 1999-2006 were analysed to determine birthweight distribution and examine perinatal mortality rates (including stillbirths and neonatal deaths within 24 hours) by birthweight in twins and singletons. Referral births from outside the district where the hospital was situated were excluded from analysis.\nThe mean birthweight for births within an estimated normal distribution was 3,172 g, with a standard deviation of 462 g. The overall perinatal mortality rate was 43.9 per 1,000 births (95% confidence interval: 40.7-47.2). Perinatal mortality rates among twins and singletons were 91.0 and 41.1 per 1000 babies respectively, corresponding to a relative risk of 2.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.7-2.8). The birthweight distribution for twins was shifted to lower birthweights. Twins had a generally lower birthweight and an excess of extremely small births as compared to singletons. The increased mortality rate for twins appeared to be independent of birthweight.\nThe two-fold increased risk of perinatal death for twins was observed across the whole birthweight distribution, and very small twins appeared to have an excess perinatal risk that was almost similar to that of larger twins.",

    "abstract": "Disorders affecting the postsynaptic side of the neuromuscular junction include autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG) as well as some of the congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS). Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an acquired autoimmune neuromuscular disorder in which autoantibodies are directed against the presynaptic calcium channels. Here we describe two monozygous twin brothers: case 1 was diagnosed with an indeterminate form of acquired postsynaptic neuromuscular junction defect at age 32 and case 2 with LEMS at age 47. Case 1 presented clinically with mild generalized myasthenic weakness, neurophysiological examination revealed disturbed neuromuscular transmission along with probable myositis and serum analysis regarding antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor and muscle-specific tyrosine kinase was negative. Case 2 presented with proximal muscle fatigue accompanied by areflexia at rest and antibodies against the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels were present. Neurophysiologically, case 2 had reduced baseline compound motor action potential amplitudes on neurography, decrement on low-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) and pathological increment on high frequency RNS. To our knowledge this is the first case report of its kind and adds an intriguing contrast to the more common diagnosis of CMS in monozygous twins.",

    "abstract": "Bone mineral density (BMD) is a measure of a person's skeletal mineral content, and assessing BMD by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) can help to diagnose diseases of low bone density. In this study, we determine the heritability of BMD in male and female monozygotic twin subjects using DEXA in 13 specific anatomical regions. In an attempt to quantify the genetic contribution of gender and skeletal region to BMD heritability, we scanned 14 pairs of identical twins using DEXA and calculated the broad-sense heritability coefficient (H(2)) in each of the 13 different body regions. The region of the body that was most heritable for both genders was the head (H(2) >or= 95%). When males were compared to females, H(2) values for male hip (H(2) = 87%) and lower extremities (H(2) = 90%) were higher than those in females (H(2) = 49% and 56%, respectively). Conversely, H(2) value for the female pelvis (H(2) = 68%) was higher than that for males (H(2) = 26%). These data show that different regions of the skeleton exhibit different degrees of heritability, and that the variation depends on gender.",

    "abstract": "It is currently not fully established whether human individuals have a genetically determined, individual-specific body odour. Volatile carboxylic acids are a key class of known human body odorants. They are released from glutamine conjugates secreted in axillary skin by a specific Nalpha-acyl-glutamine-aminoacylase present in skin bacteria. Here, we report a quantitative investigation of these odorant acids in 12 pairs of monozygotic twins. Axilla secretions were sampled twice and treated with the Nalpha-acyl-glutamine-aminoacylase. The released acids were analysed as their methyl esters with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry detection. The pattern of the analytes was compared with distance analysis. The distance was lowest between samples of the right and the left axilla taken on the same day from the same individual. It was clearly greater if the same subject was sampled on different days, but this intra-individual distance between samples was only slightly lower than the distance between samples taken from two monozygotic twins. A much greater distance was observed when comparing unrelated individuals. By applying cluster and principal component analyses, a clear clustering of samples taken from one pair of monozygotic twins was also confirmed. In conclusion, the specific pattern of precursors for volatile carboxylic acids is subject to a day-to-day variation, but there is a strong genetic contribution. Therefore, humans have a genetically determined body odour type that is at least partly composed of these odorant acids.",

    "abstract": "Anti-neoplastic treatments have significantly increased the survival of cancer patients, but female patients risk premature menopause. Oocyte cryopreservation has been proposed as a fertility-saving option. This report describes the first live birth achieved with autologous cryopreserved oocytes in an ovariectomized borderline cancer patient. A patient with a borderline ovarian tumour asked for oocyte cryopreservation after a right adnexectomy. Ovulation induction resulted in the retrieval and cryopreservation of seven mature oocytes. Thirty-nine months after a left ovariectomy, the patient asked for oocyte thawing and embryo transfer. Endometrial growth was induced using hormone replacement treatment. Three of the seven cryopreserved oocytes were thawed; they survived and, after insemination, normal fertilization took place. Three embryos were transferred into the patient's uterus. A twin pregnancy was achieved with the birth of two healthy females. Oocyte cryopreservation may be a reliable option for preserving fertility in young cancer patients who risk premature menopause due to surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of dental flossing on the microbial composition of interproximal plaque samples in matched twins.\nThe study was a two-treatment, examiner-masked, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study. Fifty-one twin pairs between 12 and 21 years of age were randomized to a 2-week supervised and unsupervised treatment regimen consisting of tongue brushing and toothbrushing or tongue brushing and toothbrushing plus flossing. The reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay was used to assess levels (abundance) of 26 microbial species in interproximal plaque samples collected from six sites per subject. An integrative computational predictive model estimated average changes in microbial abundance patterns of selected bacterial species from baseline to 2 weeks by comparing treatment groups.\nAfter the 2-week study period, putative periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria were overabundant in the group that did not floss compared to the group that performed flossing. Those included Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Prevotella intermedia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and Streptococcus mutans. Microbial species that are not consistent with the development of periodontal disease or dental caries were overabundant in the group that did floss compared to the non-flossing group.\nIn a well-matched twin cohort, tooth and tongue brushing plus flossing significantly decreased the abundance of microbial species associated with periodontal disease and dental caries after a 2-week program.",

    "abstract": "The report of 2 cases and review of the literature.\nTo report the cases of a pair of female monozygotic (high-class athletes) twins discordant for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.\nThe relation between scoliosis and exercising is rather unclear. The latter has often been considered both as a therapeutic means and a causative factor of the former. The existence of genetic predisposition in the development of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is commonly accepted. According to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a pair of female monozygotic (high-class athletes) twins, discordant for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. METHODS.: A pair of 13.5-year-old female monozygotic twins, high-class level athletes of synchronized swimming, was clinically examined during a school screening program. Both girls were observed in the standing erect position for asymmetries of the lateral contours of the trunk, shoulders, and scapulas and their limb's length was measured. The \"forward bending test\" was performed to determine the existence of rib hump asymmetry.\nOne of the sisters was considered to be suspicious of suffering from scoliosis. The radiologic evaluation that followed confirmed the existence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (left thoracolumbar curve of 32 degrees as measured by the Cobb angle). The clinical and radiologic evaluation of her sibling failed to reveal the existence of any spinal deformity.\nAdolescent idiopathic scoliosis seems to be a multifactorial skeletal disorder. The role of exercising and heredity in its development remain controversial.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to study the incidence of severe cerebral injury in monochorionic (MC) twins with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) and/or birthweight discordance.\nAll MC twin pregnancies with 2 liveborn twins were included in the study. We excluded all cases with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Sequential cranial ultrasound scans were performed in all MC twin infants.\nA total of 117 MC twin pairs were included in the study. The sIUGR of at least 1 fetus was found in 50 twin pregnancies (43%), and birthweight discordance of 25% or greater occurred in 26 twin pregnancies (22%). The overall incidence of severe cerebral injury was 3% (6/218). The incidence of severe cerebral injury in infants from twin pregnancies with and without sIUGR was 2% (2/94) and 3% (4/124), respectively (P = .62). The incidence of severe cerebral injury in infants with and without birthweight discordance was 0% (0/48) and 4% (6/170), respectively (P = .19).\nThe incidence of severe cerebral injury in MC twin pregnancies not complicated by TTTS with 2 liveborn twins is low. No association could be demonstrated with sIUGR or intertwin birthweight discordance of 25% or greater.",

    "abstract": "Blockage of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) during pregnancy is known to cause serious dysfunction of many organs of the foetus and newborn. Angiotensin II is an angiogenic factor and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent retinal neovascularisation and their use in preventing proliferative retinopathy of prematurity has been suggested. We report on twin girls born after 32 gestational weeks, who were exposed to blockage of the RAS during gestation, had severely reduced retinal vasculature and developed severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) despite receiving very little extra oxygen.\nIt is likely that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers not only reduce pathological neovascularisation but also normal vascularisation of the eyes and other organs.",

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, the etiology of which is still poorly understood. Previous studies have shown an increased risk for cigarette smokers but no accounts for the timing of exposure to smoking relative to appendectomy were made.\nBased on questionnaire data, both cohort and co-twin case-control analyses were conducted to assess the effect of active cigarette smoking on appendectomy in 3808 Australian twin pairs. Smoking status was defined as a time-dependent covariate to account for differences in timing of smoking initiation and onset of appendicitis.\nThe questionnaire had a 65% pairwise response rate. After controlling for sex, age, and year of birth, appendectomy risk in current smokers was statistically significantly increased by 65% relative to never-smokers. This was largely unchanged by the duration or intensity of smoking and was not affected by socioeconomic status or father's occupation. The effect was stronger in females. Among former smokers, increased time since quitting significantly reduced the odds ratio of appendectomy by 15% for every year since quitting.\nAfter adjustment for age and other confounders, there was an increase in risk of appendectomy among current smokers relative to never-smokers, particularly in females. This study adds to the body of knowledge on the effects of tobacco smoking on the gastrointestinal tract.",

    "abstract": "Male monozygotic twins with genetically determined severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy are described. Although seizure onset, clinical seizure symptomatology, and motor and mental development were almost identical until age 38 months, their clinical courses then became discordant. The emergence of myoclonus was delayed by 12 months in twin 1 compared with twin 2. Regression in language development, which is a common feature of severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy, was obvious in twin 2 after the emergence of myoclonus, whereas twin 1 did not demonstrate any regression. The clinical-course discordance between twins was attributable to bacterial meningitis, which twin 1 developed at age 35 months. Bacterial meningitis may have affected the clinical course of severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy in twin 1, resulting in delayed onset of myoclonus and more favorable language development in twin 1 than in twin 2, who did not experience bacterial meningitis.",

    "abstract": "Two studies have reported decreased intensity dependence of the P2 event-related potential (ERP) in male combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a response pattern presumed to reflect central nervous system-induced protective inhibition and heightened central serotonergic activity. We used an identical twin, case-control design to investigate whether intensity dependence abnormalities reflect pretrauma vulnerability or are an acquired consequence of PTSD. ERPs were measured in male Vietnam combat veterans and their noncombat-exposed monozygotic twin brothers during a four-tone, stimulus-intensity modulation procedure. Contrary to previous findings in male veterans, the PTSD group had significantly steeper P2 amplitude intensity slopes, similar to those reported for female veterans and abused children with PTSD. Additionally, increased P2 amplitude intensity slope was associated with increased PTSD symptom severity, particularly the severity of reexperiencing symptoms. A mixed-model, random-effects analysis that included the combat-unexposed twins revealed a significant diagnosis by combat exposure interaction. Inspection of group means suggests that the observed increased P2 intensity dependence is a consequence of PTSD. Our findings further suggest that low serotonergic tone may emerge as one potential consequence of this disorder.",

Amniocentesis (at 13(5/7) weeks) was performed following ultrasound signs of hydrops and cystic hygroma in twin 1 (T1). Prenatal karyotype showed non-mosaic trisomy 21 in T1 (47,XX,+21[7]), and low-grade mosaic trisomy 21 in twin 2 (T2) (47,XX,+21[2]/46,XX[19]). Post mortem examination of fetal skin, kidneys and lungs confirmed trisomy 21 in T1 (47,XX,+21[548]) and the placenta (47,XX,+21[200]). T2 had a normal karyotype (46,XX[648]). Analysis of microsatellite polymorphisms in multiple samples from the placenta, hand, lungs, kidneys and the umbilical cords of both twins confirmed monozygosity for all loci tested, and trisomy 21 in T1. Unexpectedly, T1 and T2 inherited different maternal alleles for markers of the most distal 4 Mbp of 21q. At least four successive events are needed to explain the genetic status of both twins and include maternal MI premature chromatids separation or maternal II meiotic nondisjunction and post-zygotic events such as, chromosome rescue, nondisjunction, an/or recombination.",

General diagnostic criteria comprise mosaic distribution, sporadic occurrence, and progressive course. We report on Proteus syndrome in discordant monozygotic twins. The affected 9-year-old boy showed progressive postnatal overgrowth of his right leg and foot and asymmetric progressive overgrowth of single toes with a small cerebriform connective tissue nevus on his right fourth toe. The progressive course was documented by serial photographs over a period of 3 years. Twin monozygosity was determined by PCR-amplified short tandem repeat (STR) analysis, revealing complete concordance of all alleles in both twins. This observation, to our knowledge, is only the second case report of discordant Proteus syndrome in monozygotic twins. This supports the hypothesis that this rare condition is caused by a postzygotic mutational event resulting in mosaicism.",

    "abstract": "Migraine headache (with and without aura) is common in the general population and is known to be influenced by genetic factors with heritability estimates between 34-57%. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a hypercoagulable state characterized by clinical features including venous and arterial thromboses, pregnancy loss and migraine, and by association with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Numerous small studies have investigated whether aPL are associated with migraine in the general population--with contradictory results. In this study, the question was addressed by studying the prevalence of aPL in members of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs differing in their migraine status. Such twins provide a unique natural experiment, matched as they are for age, sex and genetic factors, and allow the role of environmental factors, such as aPL, to be determined. Despite 95% power to detect a difference of 0.59 IgG units per litre in anticardiolipin antibody IgG titres, no difference in prevalence of aPL could be detected in migraine-discordant MZ twins.",

    "abstract": "A growing number of studies have suggested a link between social capital and health. However, the association may reflect confounding by factors, such as personality or early childhood environment, that are unmeasured prior common causes of both social capital and health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of social capital on physical and mental health among adult twins in the U.S.\nA cross-sectional national survey of twins within the National Survey of Midlife Development in the U.S. (MIDUS), 1995--1996 was analyzed in 2007. The study population included 944 twin pairs (37.2% monozygotic [MZ] and 62.8% dizygotic [DZ]). Data were obtained on individual-level social capital variables (social trust, sense of belonging, volunteer activity, and community participation); health outcomes (perceived physical and mental health, depressive symptoms and major depression); and individual covariates (age, gender, race, education, working status, and marital status). A fixed-effects model was used to examine health status among twin pairs who were discordant on levels of social capital.\nIn the individual data analysis, social trust, sense of belonging, and community participation were each significantly associated with health outcomes. In the fixed-effects model, physical health remained significantly positively associated with social trust among MZ and DZ twins. However, major depression was not associated with social capital.\nThe present study is the first to find the independent positive effect of social trust on self-rated physical health using fixed-effects models of twin data. The results suggest that the association between social capital and physical health status is not explained by unobserved confounds, such as personality or early childhood environment.",

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic chimerism in dizygotic twins is due to placental vascular anastomoses and arises when hematopoietic stem cells from one twin home to the bone marrow of the other. We report a case of hematopoietic chimerism in a pair of 27-year-old dizygotic twins who each had a mixture of 46,XX and 46,XY blood lymphocytes, both with 98% male (XY) lymphocytes and 2% female (XX) lymphocytes. Analysis of telomere length by T/C FISH revealed that the female twin generally had longer telomeres than the male twin. Moreover, in the male sibling, the telomeres within the female lymphocytes were shortened to 87% of their original length, while the telomeres within the male lymphocytes were 33% longer in the female sibling. Thus, telomere length attrition in peripheral lymphocytes is determined mainly by the environment of the cell and less by intracellular factors.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the regulation and metabolic effects of TCF7L2 gene expression in human sc fat and skeletal muscle and the impact of the TCF7L2, rs7903146, T-allele on gene expression and measures of glucose metabolism including insulin secretion and peripheral and hepatic insulin action.\nThe rs7903146 was genotyped in 1) a population-based sample of 587 twins (55-64 yr) with glucose tolerance ranging from normal to type 2 diabetes and 2) a population of 196 nondiabetic young (22-31 yr) and elderly (57-66 yr) twins. All subjects underwent oral glucose tolerance tests, and population 2 was additionally examined with iv glucose tolerance tests and hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamps.\nElderly T-allele carriers had decreased plasma insulin responses and lower disposition index, whereas insulinogenic index was similar between genotype groups. Elderly nondiabetic T-allele carriers had increased peripheral insulin sensitivity (P = 0.03). Young T-allele carriers had impaired hepatic insulin sensitivity (P = 0.04) independent of plasma insulin levels. TCF7L2 gene expression in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue was not explained by genotype, sex, aerobic capacity, birth, or adult anthropometry and was not associated with in vivo glucose metabolism.\nThe rs7903146 T-allele associates with hepatic insulin resistance and diminished glucose-stimulated plasma insulin secretion. Our study does not provide evidence of a role of TCF7L2 gene expression in sc fat tissue and muscle tissue in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. This suggests that the primary defect of rs7903146 T-allele carriers is impairment of insulin secretion rather than a defect in insulin action in peripheral tissues.",

    "abstract": "To clarify the relationship between depression and heart rate variability (HRV) in a sample of twins. Reduced HRV, a measure of autonomic dysfunction, has been linked to depression but many studies have inadequately controlled for familial and environmental factors. Furthermore, little is known about whether depression and HRV share common genetic pathways.\nWe performed power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms in 288 middle-aged male twins. Log-normalized ultra low, very low, low, high frequency, and total power were calculated. A lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD) was determined, using the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders, and current depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory. Mixed-effect regression models were used to account for intrapair variability and estimate within-pair effects at the same time controlling for potential confounders.\nBoth current depressive symptoms and a history of MDD were significantly associated with lower HRV. There was a graded effect, and power in each frequency band was 29% to 36% lower in the lowest band compared with the highest BDI category. All HRV measures except high frequency remained significantly associated with current depressive symptoms in multivariable analysis, but not with lifetime history of MDD. When analyses were stratified by zygosity, a significant within-pair association between BDI score and HRV was found in the dizygotic but not in the monozygotic twins, suggesting a genetic influence on the association.\nA shared, genetically influenced biological pathway underlies the association between depression and lower HRV. These two phenotypes may be the expression of a generalized neurobiological perturbation.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have suggested that bifocal and progressive spectacles can reduce progression of myopia in esophoric children. This study compared myopic progression with bifocal (BSCL) and single vision soft contact lenses (SVSCL) in identical twins with near point esophoria.\nTwo 12-year-old myopic girls were randomly assigned to wear either BSCL or SVSCL for one year using a double-masked design. Both twins then wore BSCLs for another year. Ocular measurements included cycloplegic and manifest refractions, corneal curvature and axial length. Distance and near phorias were measured through distance corrections and near associated phorias, with both types of contact lenses.\nThrough their SVSCLs, both children exhibited near associated esophorias, which were neutralised by the BSCLs. The child wearing SVSCLs over the first year showed significant myopic progression, increasing -1.19 D (binocular average), while the child wearing BSCLs showed no progression (+0.13 D). The latter child showed limited progression (-0.28 D) over the second year, while switching from SVSCLs to BSCLs arrested progression in the other child (+0.44 D after one year). Axial length data were consistent with the refractive findings; the child exhibiting more myopia at the end of the first 12 months of the study had longer eyes (by 0.64 mm) than her sister, although their corneas also had steepened more (by 0.44 D compared to 0.18 D). The children showed minimal changes [corrected] in eye size over the second year when both wore BSCLs (binocular averages: -0.05, -0.09 [corrected] mm, respectively).\nThe apparent inhibitory effect of BSCLs on myopic progression reported in this twin study argues for further study of their efficacy as a control treatment for myopes with near esophoria.",

    "abstract": "Little is known of the onset of breast cancer in high-risk populations. We investigated the risk of breast cancer in twin sisters and in the contralateral breast taking family history into consideration.\nWe analyzed a Scandinavian population-based cohort of 2,499 female twin pairs, in which at least one had a diagnosis of breast cancer and estimated the risk of breast cancer in the sister. Using a total of 11 million individuals in Sweden with complete family links, we identified 93,448 women with breast cancer and estimated the risk of a bilateral breast cancer.\nThe incidence of breast cancer in twin sisters of breast cancer patients was 0.64% per year and 0.42% per year in mono- and dizygotic twin sisters, respectively. In comparison, the risk of familial (affected first-degree relative) and nonfamilial bilateral breast cancer was 1.03% per year and 0.68% per year, respectively. Contrary to the risk of unilateral disease, the risk of cancer in the nonaffected twin and the opposite breast was not affected by age or time since first event. The relative risk of familial bilateral cancer was 52% higher (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.52; 95% CI, 1.42 to 1.64) and the relative risk in the dizygotic twin sister was 25% lower (IRR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.91) compared with the risk of nonfamilial bilateral cancer.\nThe elevated risk of breast cancer in high-risk groups is little affected by age and time since diagnosis. Our findings suggest that susceptible groups of women might have already aggregated genetic prerequisites for breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Chromogranin A (CHGA) triggers catecholamine secretory granule biogenesis, and its catestatin fragment inhibits catecholamine release. We approached catestatin heritability using twin pairs, coupled with genome-wide linkage, in a series of twin and sibling pairs from 2 continents.\nHypertensive patients had elevated CHGA coupled with reduction in catestatin, suggesting diminished conversion of precursor to catestatin. Heritability for catestatin in twins was 44% to 60%. Six hundred fifteen nuclear families yielded 870 sib pairs for linkage, with significant logarithm of odds peaks on chromosomes 4p, 4q, and 17q. Because acidification of catecholamine secretory vesicles determines CHGA trafficking and processing to catestatin, we genotyped at positional candidate ATP6N1, bracketed by peak linkage markers on chromosome 17q, encoding a subunit of vesicular H(+)-translocating ATPase. The minor allele diminished CHGA secretion and processing to catestatin. The ATP6N1 variant also influenced blood pressure in 1178 individuals with the most extreme blood pressure values in the population. In chromaffin cells, inhibition of H(+)-ATPase diverted CHGA from regulated to constitutive secretory pathways.\nWe established heritability of catestatin in twins from 2 continents. Linkage identified 3 regions contributing to catestatin, likely novel determinants of sympathochromaffin exocytosis. At 1 such positional candidate (ATP6N1), variation influenced CHGA secretion and processing to catestatin, confirming the mechanism of a novel trans-QTL for sympathochromaffin activity and blood pressure.",

    "abstract": "The otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) measured in a collection of special populations of humans and certain nonhuman species suggest that OAEs may provide a window into some processes of human prenatal development and sexual differentiation. For reasons that are unclear, OAEs appear to be highly sensitive to events occurring during prenatal development that seem to be related to the degree of exposure to androgens a fetus receives. The (largely circumstantial) evidence for a relationship between androgen exposure and OAE strength comes from a series of studies of twins, children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, people of differing sexual orientations, and spotted hyenas, among others. Some conclusions are bolstered by parallel studies using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). OAEs and AEPs are simple, objective, noninvasive measures that appear to have potential as tools of value to researchers working on a wide variety of basic and applied topics beyond audition.",

    "abstract": "Genetic and environmental factors are known to contribute to cannabis abuse/dependence (CAD). We sought to determine the magnitude of the contribution from measured environmental variables to offspring cannabis dependence in a design that controls for familial vulnerability. Data come from a study of 725 twin members of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, 720 of their biological offspring (age 18-32 years) and 427 mothers. Data were obtained on offspring perception of family and peer support and substance use behaviors and offspring CAD. After adjusting for familial risk, and environmental covariates, CAD was significantly more likely among male offspring (OR=2.73; 95% CI: 1.69-4.41). Offspring CAD was associated with reporting: siblings used illicit drugs (OR=3.40; 95% CI: 1.81-6.38), a few friends used drugs (OR=2.72; 95% CI: 1.04-7.09), a quarter or more friends used drugs (OR=8.30; 95% CI: 3.09-22.33) and one-half or more 12th grade peers used drugs (OR=3.17; 95% CI: 1.42-7.08). Perceived sibling, friend and school peer substance use are strongly associated with CAD in young adults even after accounting for latent familial risk and for multiple measured intra-family and extra-family environmental influences.",

    "abstract": "The smoking behavior of friends is a major risk factor for adolescent smoking uptake. To explore the social context of smoking experimentation and consolidation with a particular focus on friends, the authors interviewed both members of 14 young adult identical twin pairs who were discordant for smoking. The different smoking status of twins was connected to their different friendship groups and development of different identities. Smoking respondents gravitated to the behaviors and images of the peer group who smoked. Many nonsmokers felt strong pressure from their peers not to smoke and spoke about how the images conveyed by smoking were inconsistent with their peer group's image. Adolescents and young adults are aware of the messages that smoking can convey to others and exploit these images to construct a social identity.",

    "abstract": "To analyze dizygotic twinning rates and outcomes over a 25-year period.\nBirth and fetal death certificates from 1980-2004 in Washington State, USA, were analyzed retrospectively to find factors associated with the increase in sex-discordant twins through time. \"Low\" and \"high\" fertility treatment groups were defined according to demographic traits. Perinatal mortality was defined as fetal or neonatal death of one or both twins and Weinberg's rule was used to estimate mortality for monozygotic and dizygotic pairs.\nControlling simultaneously for maternal age, race, parity, and education did not eliminate the trend of increasing sex-discordant twins from 1992-2004 (M-H chi2 P=0.001). The \"low\" fertility group had a non-significant decline in sex-discordant twins (M-H chi2 P=0.24), whereas the \"high\" fertility group had a significant increase (M-H chi2 P=0.001). Perinatal mortality decreased for monozygtic twin pairs throughout the study period, but decreased until the mid-1990s and then increased slightly through 2004 for the dizygotic twin pairs.\nAdvancing maternal age and increasing use of fertility treatments are largely responsible for the increase in dizygotic twins from 1980-2004 and may also be responsible for the stalling of the decline in perinatal mortality rate.",

    "abstract": "BMI is highly heritable. Yet, trends in obesity highlight environmental influences on body weight. Monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for overweight offer a unique opportunity to examine these factors.\nMZ male (n=8 pairs) and female twins (n=10 pairs) discordant for overweight (defined as the BMI of one twin being at least 24.5, and the BMI of his/her co-twin being below 24.5 and at least three points lower) were identified from the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry. Variables were assessed via self-report questionnaires.\nOne overweight and two non-overweight females met criteria for bulimia nervosa. Rates of dieting and binge eating were high among all males and females. Hunger scores were higher among non-overweight females; disinhibition scores were higher among overweight males. Only one non-overweight and three overweight males smoked; 90% of non-overweight and 40% of overweight females smoked.\nAssessing tobacco use and eating disorders may be important when sampling on the basis of family members who are discordant for BMI. Finally, results suggest possibilities for interventions in individuals at-risk for overweight.",

    "abstract": "Female carriers of haemophilia B are usually asymptomatic; however, the disease resulting from different pathophysiological mechanisms has rarely been documented in females. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for haemophilia B in fraternal female twins. We sequenced the factor IX gene (F9) of the propositus, her father, a severe haemophilia B patient and the other family members. X chromosome inactivation was assessed by the methylation-sensitive HpaII-PCR assay using X-linked polymorphisms in human phosphoglycerate kinase 1 gene (PGK1) and glutamate receptor ionotropic AMPA 3 gene (GRIA3). The twins were found to be heterozygotes with a nonsense mutation (p.Arg384X) inherited from their father. The propositus, more severely affected twin, exhibited a significantly higher percentage of inactivation in the maternally derived X chromosome carrying a normal F9. The other twin also showed a skewed maternal X inactivation, resulting in a patient with mild haemophilia B. Thus, the degree of skewing of maternal X inactivation is closely correlated with the coagulation parameters and the clinical phenotypes of the twins. Furthermore, we identified a crossing-over in the Xq25-26 region of the maternal X chromosome of the more severely affected twin. This crossing-over was absent in the other twin, consistent with their fraternal state. Differently skewed X inactivation in the fraternal female twins might cause moderately severe and mild haemophilia B phenotypes, respectively.",

    "abstract": "There is still uncertainty about the relative importance of genes and environments on human sexual orientation. One reason is that previous studies employed self-selected, opportunistic, or small population-based samples. We used data from a truly population-based 2005-2006 survey of all adult twins (20-47 years) in Sweden to conduct the largest twin study of same-sex sexual behavior attempted so far. We performed biometric modeling with data on any and total number of lifetime same-sex sexual partners, respectively. The analyses were conducted separately by sex. Twin resemblance was moderate for the 3,826 studied monozygotic and dizygotic same-sex twin pairs. Biometric modeling revealed that, in men, genetic effects explained .34-.39 of the variance, the shared environment .00, and the individual-specific environment .61-.66 of the variance. Corresponding estimates among women were .18-.19 for genetic factors, .16-.17 for shared environmental, and 64-.66 for unique environmental factors. Although wide confidence intervals suggest cautious interpretation, the results are consistent with moderate, primarily genetic, familial effects, and moderate to large effects of the nonshared environment (social and biological) on same-sex sexual behavior.",

    "abstract": "The present analyses aimed to test the prediction that schizophrenia patients and their non-schizophrenic co-twins would display reduced efficiency of the neurocognitive mechanisms subserving active maintenance of spatial information in working memory.\nUpper alpha frequency band EEG event-related desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS) were calculated as percent changes in power relative to an inter-trial baseline across 4 memory loads in a spatial delayed-response task.\nDuring the delay, the diagnostic groups showed equivalent ERD/ERS activity over posterior scalp regions at the lowest memory load; however, as memory load increased, patients, and to an intermediate degree, their non-schizophrenic co-twins (monozygotic and dizygotic pairs collapsed together), showed significantly greater increases in ERD/ERS amplitude as compared with controls.\nThese findings demonstrate abnormally increased ERD/ERS amplitudes with increasing memory load in patients with schizophrenia and their co-twins, consistent with inefficiency of the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting active maintenance of information across a delay.",

    "abstract": "Variation in the level of gene expression is a major determinant of a cell's function and characteristics. Common allelic variants of genes can be expressed at different levels and thus contribute to phenotypic diversity. We have measured allelic expression differences at heterozygous loci in monozygotic twins and in unrelated individuals. We show that the extent of differential allelic expression is highly similar within monozygotic twin pairs for many loci, implying that allelic differences in gene expression are under genetic control. We also show that even subtle departures from equal allelic expression are often genetically determined.",
