    "abstract": "A 30-years-old Taiwanese female in her second pregnancy spontaneously conceived a monochorionic twin pregnancy. A routine ultrasound at 27 weeks of gestation revealed a selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) fetus and an appropriate gestational age (AGA) fetus. The AGA fetus was found to have a fetal intra-abdominal umbilical vein (FIUV) varix. Serial ultrasounds showed no changes in the FIUV varix. 2 weeks later, the pregnancy progressed to twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Repeated amnioreductions were required at 29 and 30 weeks gestation. The babies were delivered by caesarean section at 31 weeks due to fetal distress in the sIUGR fetus. Both fetuses survived the neonatal period with problems of prematurity. The FIUV varix disappeared a few days after delivery.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces a co-twin control method commonly used in the medical literature but not often within educational research. This method allows for a comparison of twins discordant for an \"exposure,\" approximating alternative outcomes in the counterfactual model. Example analyses use data drawn from the Florida Twin Project on Reading to determine whether exposure to \"teacher quality,\" measured by growth in oral reading fluency (ORF) scores of classmates, causally affects ORF performance of twins in the subsequent years. The analysis highlights PROC MIXED in SAS, including a novel expansion to allow for the nested data. Results from 2,788 twins suggested that being in classrooms with lower teacher quality in first grade leads to lower ORF scores in second and third grade with little indication of possible genetic or environmental confounding.",

    "abstract": "One of the most consistent findings in psychology shows that people prefer and make positive attributions about attractive compared with unattractive people. The goal of the current study was to determine the power of attractiveness effects by testing whether these social judgments are made where attractiveness differences are smallest: between twins. Differences in facial attractiveness predicted twins' evaluations of self and their co-twin (n = 158; 54 male). In twin pairs, the more attractive twin judged their less attractive sibling as less physically attractive, athletic, socially competent, and emotionally stable. The less attractive twin did the reverse. Given that even negligible differences in facial attractiveness predicted self and co-twin attitudes, these results provide the strongest test yet of appearance-based stereotypes.",

    "abstract": "Epimerase deficiency galactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from partial impairment of UDP-galactose 4'-epimerase (GALE), the third enzyme in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism. Clinical severity of epimerase deficiency ranges from potentially lethal to apparently benign, likely reflecting the extent of GALE enzyme impairment, among other factors. We report here a case study of monozygotic twins identified by newborn screening with elevated total galactose and normal galactose-1P uridylyltransferase (GALT). Follow-up testing revealed partial impairment of GALE in hemolysates but near-normal activity in lymphoblasts; molecular testing identified a missense substitution, R220W, apparently in the homozygous state. The twins were treated with dietary galactose restriction for the first 18 months of life. During this time, independent testing revealed concurrent diagnoses of Williams Syndrome in both twins, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in one. Expression studies of R220W-hGALE in a null-background strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated a very limited impairment of V (max) for UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) and K (m) for UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc), but a galactose challenge in vivo failed to uncover any evidence of impaired Leloir function. Similarly, both twins demonstrated normal hemolysate galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1P) levels following normalization of their diets at 18 months of age. While these studies cannot rule out a negative consequence from some cryptic GALE impairment in a specific tissue or developmental stage, they suggest that the substitution, R220W, is mild to neutral, so that any GALE impairment in these twins is likely to be peripheral and therefore unlikely to be the cause of the negative outcomes observed.",

    "abstract": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most ubiquitous member of the herpes virus family and is the leading cause of congenital (vertical) infection in newborns (Fowler, Stagno, & Pass, 2003; Llorente, Steigmeyer, Cooper, Rivers, & Gazley, 2011; Noyola et al., 2000; Steigmeyer & Llorente, 2010). CMV is related to the group of viruses capable of causing more pernicious infectious diseases, such as chicken pox (Santos de Barona, 1998). Although the virus generally remains dormant, individuals whose symptoms are clinically apparent often are dramatically affected. Common symptomatic characteristics of the virus include microcephaly, jaundice, liver-spleen infections, pneumonia, cardiac anomalies, chorioretinitis, vision loss, sensory-neural hearing loss, mental retardation, and mononucleosis (Demmler, 1991; Kashden, Frison, Fowler, Pass, & Boll, 1998; Noyola et al., 2000; Pass, 2005; Santos de Barona). The prognosis of individuals with CMV is highly variable, and the prognosis of individuals with congenital CMV can usually be determined based on the extent of infection at birth. The purpose of this investigation is to present longitudinal results of neuropsychological evaluation of two dizygotic twin sets (one twin of each set is asymptomatic CMV-positive and the other is uninfected) who were reared in the same environment. In addition, the present findings are discussed within the context of emerging murine and other animal analogues of CMV as well as within the extant CMV literature.",

    "abstract": "Trisomy 21, the cause of Down syndrome (DS), is the most frequent trisomy in humans. The risk for DS increases with maternal age: mothers under 25 years of age are known to have an average risk of a DS pregnancy of 1: 1600, rising to 1: 350 at age 35 and to 1: 40 at 43, respectively. Twins with DS are rare. We report on monozygotic (MZ), monochorionic twin sisters with DS, whose parents are young (24 and 26 years old, respectively) and healthy. Family history is non contributory; pregnancy and delivery were uneventful. Both girls presented at birth with clinical manifestations of Down syndrome, that was confirmed cytogenetically (47XX,+21). Microsatellites analysis indicated that the twins are identical and that the extra chromosome 21 was of paternal origin.\nFor practical purposes, the causative non disjunction should be considered a single sporadic event, with an empirical recurrence risk estimated at about 1%.",

    "abstract": "To determine the genetic and environmental influences exerted on arthritis by measuring the distribution of self-reported arthritis diagnoses among monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) African American twins.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted on 97 MZ and 113 DZ twin pairs recruited into the Carolina African American Twin Study of Aging (CAATSA). The sample had a mean age of 47 +/- 13.9 years. A twin design was used to determine correlations in arthritis diagnosis for MZ and DZ twins and to estimate the contribution of genes and environment to the variation in an arthritis diagnosis.\nThe concordance rate for being diagnosed with arthritis was 42% for MZ twins, and 20% for DZ twins, resulting in a 2.1:1 ratio of MZ to DZ concordance. These results indicate a significant proportion of individual variability was due to genetic factors (43%) on an arthritis diagnosis as well as 57% of variance due to nonshared environmental influences.\nThis research suggests that while there are genetic influences on arthritis diagnosis, environmental factors, such as infections, dietary factors, urbanization, and pollutants, also play a role in accounting for variability in the diagnosis and treatment of arthritis among diverse populations.",

    "abstract": "Kabuki syndrome (OMIM 147920) is a rare disorder characterised by moderate intellectual disability, growth retardation, microcephaly and characteristic facial dysmorphic features which comprise long palpebral fissures, eversion of the lateral third of the eyelids and arched eyebrows with lateral sparseness. Mutations in MLL2 are the most frequent cause of this disorder. More than 100 MLL2 point mutations have been reported, but large intragenic deletions comprising one or more exons have not yet been identified. We report on a pair of monozygotic twin brothers in whom a deletion of 2 neighbouring exons was detected. The twins had the characteristic facial features of Kabuki syndrome, and they suffered from microcephaly, cleft lip and palate and congenital heart disease. Cleft lip and palate were left-sided in the first twin and right-sided in the second twin, i.e. they represented a mirror-image asymmetry. The intragenic deletion in these brothers broadens the spectrum of MLL2 mutations, and they provide a rare example of mirror-image asymmetry of congenital malformations in monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional analysis of facial shape and symmetry in twins.\nFaces of 37 twin pairs [19 monozygotic (MZ) and 18 dizygotic (DZ)] were laser scanned at the age of 15 during a follow-up of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), South West of England.\nFacial shape was analysed using two methods: 1) Procrustes analysis of landmark configurations (63 x, y and z coordinates of 21 facial landmarks) and 2) three-dimensional comparisons of facial surfaces within each twin pair. Monozygotic and DZ twins were compared using ellipsoids representing 95% of the variation in landmark configurations and surface-based average faces. Facial symmetry was analysed by superimposing the original and mirror facial images.\nBoth analyses showed greater similarity of facial shape in MZ twins, with lower third being the least similar. Procrustes analysis did not reveal any significant difference in facial landmark configurations of MZ and DZ twins. The average faces of MZ and DZ males were coincident in the forehead, supraorbital and infraorbital ridges, the bridge of the nose and lower lip. In MZ and DZ females, the eyes, supraorbital and infraorbital ridges, philtrum and lower part of the cheeks were coincident. Zygosity did not seem to influence the amount of facial symmetry. Lower facial third was the most asymmetrical.\nThree-dimensional analyses revealed differences in facial shapes of MZ and DZ twins. The relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors is different for the upper, middle and lower facial thirds.",

Procrustes analysis did not reveal any significant difference in facial landmark configurations of MZ and DZ twins. The average faces of MZ and DZ males were coincident in the forehead, supraorbital and infraorbital ridges, the bridge of the nose and lower lip. In MZ and DZ females, the eyes, supraorbital and infraorbital ridges, philtrum and lower part of the cheeks were coincident. Zygosity did not seem to influence the amount of facial symmetry. Lower facial third was the most asymmetrical.",

    "abstract": "Background. Assisted reproductive technology has been linked to the increased incidence of monozygotic twinning. It is of clinical importance due to the increased risk of complications in multiple pregnancies in general and in monozygotic twins in particular. Case. A 29-year-old female, nulligravida underwent her first IVF cycle. Three poor-quality cleavage stage embryos were transferred resulting in monochorionic triamniotic triplets and dichorionic diamniotic twins. Selective embryo reduction was performed at 12 weeks leaving dichorionic twins. The patient underwent emergency cesarean section due to preterm labor and nonreassuring fetal heart tracing at 30 weeks of gestation. Conclusion. Our case emphasizes that even embryos with significant morphological abnormalities should be considered viable and the possibility of simultaneous spontaneous embryo splitting must be factored into determining number of embryos to transfer.",

    "abstract": "To assess the effectiveness and feasibility of retaining a singleton or twins for multifetal pregnancy reduction (MFPR) in triplet pregnancy with monochorionic twins.\nThis retrospective study was conducted from January 2006 to September 2011 at a university reproductive medical center. Multifetal pregnant patients (n=35) with dichorionic triplets underwent MFPR in the first trimester to reduce one or both monochorionic twins. These cases were divided into two groups: Group A (9 MFPR cases to reduce one monochorionic twin) and Group B (26 MFPR for both monochorionic twins). Control A (for Group A) included another 18 cases of trichorionic triplet reduction to twins; Control B (for Group B) included 35 cases of trichorionic triplet reduction to singletons. MFPR was performed during the same period for all groups. Pregnancy outcomes were compared between groups.\nPatients were 28-39 years old; the average gestation for fetal reduction was 6-8 weeks. The early abortion rate was lower in Group A than Group B (0 versus 11.5%, p=0.339), but the late abortion rate was significantly higher in Group A. (33.3% versus 0, p=0.000). Groups A and B did not differ significantly in premature labor rate, term birth rate, gestation at delivery and take-home baby rate. The rate of very low and low birth weight was significantly higher in Group A than Group B (50% versus 0, p=0.001), and the average birth weight was significantly lower in Group A (2391.7\u00b1318.5 versus 3119.6\u00b1523.9, p=0.001). Group A had significantly more low birth-weight newborns than Control A (50% versus 13.3%, p<0.05 [0.024]). Group B (retained singleton) had similar pregnancy outcomes and neonatal conditions as Control B.\nRetaining a singleton is always the best choice when deciding about using MFPR to improve pregnancy outcomes. For patients having a triplet pregnancy with monochorionic twins and strongly desiring to keep twins, MFPR in one monochorionic twin was feasible by aspirating embryonic parts early in gestation (6-8 weeks) with no drug injection. Pregnancy outcomes are similar with twin reduction in trichorionic triplet pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical findings in a set of monozygotic twins with autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV) over a 23-year period.\nA pair of female twins were examined between 26 and 49 years of age. The concordance and discordance of their clinical features were determined. The CAPN5 gene was sequenced using genomic DNA.\nBoth twins of an affected father demonstrated Stage I ADNIV with mild vitreous cells and a negative b-wave on electroretinography. Genetic analysis confirmed a guanine to thymine nucleotide (c.728G>T, pArg243Leu) mutation in the CAPN5 gene. Over the course of 23 years, each twin progressed to stage III disease, showing posterior uveitis, cystoid macular edema, intraocular fibrosis, early retinal neovascularization, retinal degeneration, and cataract. Disease progression varied moderately between each twin and was asymmetrical between eyes. Twin A had 20/70 and 20/125 in the right and left eye, respectively, and underwent vitrectomy surgery and intravitreal injections with bevacizumab for recurrent cystoid macular edema. Twin B maintained 20/20 and 20/40 in the right and left eye, respectively without intervention.\nThere was asymmetry between the eyes and some discordance in the rate of disease progression in these monozygotic twins with ADNIV. The overall high disease concordance suggests genetic factors play a major role in clinical manifestations in CAPN5 vitreoretinopathy.",

    "abstract": "Aspartylglucosaminuria is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder leading early to a progressive intellectual disability. Monozygous Qatari twins presented with an unusual perinatal manifestation characterized by severe muscular hypotonia, scarce spontaneous movements, multiple contractures, and respiratory insufficiency. Biochemical investigations suggested aspartylglucosaminuria, and a novel homozygous mutation c.439T>C (p.S147P) was found in the aspartylglucosaminidase gene. However, it cannot be excluded that the unusual neonatal presentation is due to an additional autosomal recessive disease in this multiply consanguineous family. The classical aspartylglucosaminuria phenotype (progressive speech delay, psychomotor retardation, and behavioral abnormalities) was observed in 3 Turkish siblings. Although aspartylglucosaminuria was suspected early, the definite diagnosis was not confirmed until the age of 18 years. A novel homozygous mutation c.346C>T (p.R116W) was found. These 5 cases emphasize that aspartylglucosaminuria is panethnic and may possibly present with prenatal manifestation. Screening for aspartylglucosaminuria should be done in all patients with unexplained psychomotor retardation.",

    "abstract": "Soluble fractalkine (sFRACT) is involved in the pathogenesis of several clinical diseases. Our major objective was to determine to what extent its variation is governed by genetic factors and whether this genetic variation could be attributable to SNPs in five candidate genes: CX3CL1, CX3CR1, ADAM10, ADAM17 and AREG.\nPlasma levels of sFRACT and 38 SNPs, with minor allele frequency >0.1 were examined in a large twin sample drawn from the general UK population. The discovery sample included 3306 middle-aged females: 1172 MZ twins and 2134 DZ twins. A replication sample of 1675 twins was used to validate the major association results obtained in genetic association analysis in the discovery sample. We implemented variance component analysis to estimate contribution of putative genetic, (including above SNPs) and environmental factors to sFRACT variation.\nsFRACT was found not to vary with either age or BMI. Putative genetic factors (heritability) explained 43.6\u00b13% of the total variation of plasma sFRACT levels. However, we found no evidence of association between sFRACT and any of the examined SNPs, despite having >85% power to detect an association of just 1% of the variance explained. The results in the discovery and replication samples were in good agreement suggesting these findings are real.\nOur results suggest involvement of genetic factors to inter-individual variation of sFRACT levels in a general human population. However, further studies are required to determine genetic polymorphisms affecting sFRACT variation.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia. Several studies have shown association of genetic variants with AF and that familial AF increases the risk of AF. We have previously shown a substantial heritability of AF in a twin study. The objective of this study was to determine whether having a co-twin with AF influences mortality.\nWe identified all Danish twins with AF born during and after 1912 in the Danish Twin Registry, the National Patient Registry, and the Central Office of Civil Registration. For each twin, we randomly identified 4 twins without AF, matched on sex, zygosity, and age. We compared survival among the co-twins of the affected twins (co-cases, n=2164) and the co-twins of the unaffected twins (co-controls, n=8626). The co-cases showed increased death rates compared with the co-controls (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.30; P<0.0001), and this effect was more pronounced in monozygotic twins (hazard ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.55; P=0.003), compared with dizygotic same sex (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.29; P=0.006) and opposite sex twins (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.47; P=0.093).\nThe mortality rate was 20% higher in twins who had a co-twin with AF than in twins without familial AF. This effect was almost doubled in monozygotic twins compared with dizygotic twins, suggesting the influence of genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins discordant for type 2 diabetes constitute an ideal model to study environmental contributions to type 2 diabetic traits. We aimed to examine whether global DNA methylation differences exist in major glucose metabolic tissues from these twins.\nSkeletal muscle (n = 11 pairs) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (n = 5 pairs) biopsies were collected from 53-80 year-old monozygotic twin pairs discordant for type 2 diabetes. DNA methylation was measured by microarrays at 26,850 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites in the promoters of 14,279 genes. Bisulfite sequencing was applied to validate array data and to quantify methylation of intergenic repetitive DNA sequences. The overall intra-pair variation in DNA methylation was large in repetitive (LINE1, D4Z4 and NBL2) regions compared to gene promoters (standard deviation of intra-pair differences: 10% points vs. 4% points, P<0.001). Increased variation of LINE1 sequence methylation was associated with more phenotypic dissimilarity measured as body mass index (r = 0.77, P = 0.007) and 2-hour plasma glucose (r = 0.66, P = 0.03) whereas the variation in promoter methylation did not associate with phenotypic differences. Validated methylation changes were identified in the promoters of known type 2 diabetes-related genes, including PPARGC1A in muscle (13.9\u00b16.2% vs. 9.0\u00b14.5%, P = 0.03) and HNF4A in adipose tissue (75.2\u00b13.8% vs. 70.5\u00b13.7%, P<0.001) which had increased methylation in type 2 diabetic individuals. A hypothesis-free genome-wide exploration of differential methylation without correction for multiple testing identified 789 and 1,458 CpG sites in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, respectively. These methylation changes only reached some percentage points, and few sites passed correction for multiple testing.\nOur study suggests that likely acquired DNA methylation changes in skeletal muscle or adipose tissue gene promoters are quantitatively small between type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic twins. The importance of methylation changes in candidate genes such as PPARGC1A and HNF4A should be examined further by replication in larger samples.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate associations between psychosocial working conditions, occupational groups defined by sector, and disability pension (DP) with mental diagnoses while accounting for familial confounding.\nA prospective population-based cohort study was conducted, including all Swedish twins who, in January 1993, were living and working in Sweden and not on old-age pension or DP (N=42 715). The twins were followed from 1993-2008 regarding DP. Data on DP, exposures, and covariates were obtained from national registries. Cox proportional hazards regression models with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were constructed for the whole cohort, and for discordant twin pairs.\nThe associations for the whole cohort between DP with mental diagnoses and (i) job demands (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.06-1.43), (ii) job control (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-0.99), (iii) healthcare and social work (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.04-1.92), and (iv) service and military work (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.37-3.14) remained after accounting for possible confounders, including familial factors, while the associations between DP and (i) social support, (ii) type of jobs, and (iii) some of the occupational groups were attenuated, becoming non-significant. In the discordant twin pair analyses, commercial work was significantly associated with lower risk of DP (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.95).\nOne unit increase in job demands and working in the occupational groups healthcare and social work or service and military work seem to be risk factors of DP with mental diagnoses, independent from various background factors including familial ones. However, one unit increase in job control or working in commercial work seem to be protective factors of such DP, accounting for confounding factors of this study.",

    "abstract": "With the increased birth rate of twins during the recent decades and improved prognosis of preterm infants, there is a need to explore measures that could optimise their growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. It has been postulated that co-bedding simulates the twins' intrauterine experiences in which co-regulatory behaviours between the twins are observed. These behaviours are proposed to benefit the twins by reducing their stress, which may promote growth and development. However, uncertainties exist on the benefit-risk profile of co-bedding in practice.\nWe aimed to assess the effects of co-bedding on growth, and other clinically relevant physiological and neurodevelopmental outcomes for stable preterm twins.\nWe used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (CNRG). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (hosted by EBCHOST), CINAHL and references cited in our shortlisted articles using keywords and MesH headings, up to July 2012.\nWe included randomised controlled trials with randomisation either at the level of each twin pair and/or at the level of neonatal unit. We excluded cross-over studies.\nWe extracted data using the standard methods of the CNRG. Two review authors independently assessed the relevance and risk of bias of the retrieved records. We contacted the authors of the included studies if important information was missing from their published papers. We expressed our results using risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) where appropriate with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We adjusted the unit of analysis from individual infants to twin pairs by averaging the measurement for each twin pair (continuous outcome) or by counting the outcome as positive if any of the twins developed the outcome (dichotomous outcome).\nFive studies met the inclusion criteria; however, data were only available for analysis in four studies. Four of the five included studies were small and had significant limitations in design. As each study reported the outcomes differently, data for most of the outcomes were effectively contributed by a single study. There were no differences between co-bedded twins and twins that received separate care in the rate of weight gain (MD 0.20 grams/kg/day, 95% CI: -1.60 to 2.00), apnoea, bradycardia and desaturation (A/B/D) episodes (RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.18 to 4.05; 1 study), length of hospital stay (MD -4.90 days, 95% CI: -35.23 to 25.43) and infection rates (typical RR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.30 to 2.31; 3 studies). There were also no differences in parental perceptions of care. Co-bedded twins appeared to spend more time crying, but they also seemed to spend more time in quiet sleep. There was low or very low quality of evidence across all the outcomes.\nThere was insufficient evidence on the benefits and harms of co-bedding stable preterm twins to make any recommendation in practice. There is a need for future studies that are adequately powered to detect clinically important differences in growth and neurodevelopment. Such studies should also assess harms including infections and medication errors, and caregiver satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "Twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence, is a rare malformation occurring in monozygotic multiple gestations. One well-developed normal (pump) twin and the other twin with absent cardiac structure (acardiac), who is hemodynamically dependent on the normal (pump) twin are characteristic of this syndrome. The acardiac twin develops multiple anomalies that make survival difficult. The prognosis of the pump twin is variable with mortality rate ranging from 50% to 70%. Complications that affect the prognosis of the pump twin include complications of congestive cardiac failure due to increased cardiac demand, prematurity secondary to preterm delivery, and polyhydramnios. Because of these complications prompt detection, follow-up, and treatment of this condition is very important. We report two cases of TRAP sequence that emphasizes the importance of gray-scale and color Doppler imaging in diagnosis, detection of poor prognostic features, follow-up, and management of TRAP sequence.",

    "abstract": "T cells mediate the inflammatory responses observed in asthma among genetically susceptible individuals and have been suspected to be prone to epigenetic regulation. However, these relationships are not well established from past clinical studies that have had limited capacity to control for the effects of variable genetic predisposition and early environmental exposures. Relying on a cohort of monozygotic twins discordant for asthma we sought to determine if epigenetic modifications in T cells were associated with current asthma and explored whether such modifications were associated with second hand smoke exposures. Our study was conducted in a monozygotic twin cohort of adult twin pairs (n\u200a=\u200a21) all discordant for asthma. Regulatory T cell (Treg) and effector T cell (Teff) subsets were assessed for levels of cellular function, protein expression, gene expression and CpG methylation within Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) and interferon gamma-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) loci. Comparisons by asthma and current report of exposure to second hand smoke were made. Treg from asthmatic discordant twins demonstrated decreased FOXP3 protein expression and impaired Treg function that was associated with increased levels of CpG methylation within the FOXP3 locus when compared to their non-asthmatic twin partner. In parallel, Teff from discordant asthmatic twins demonstrated increased methylation of the IFN\u03b3 locus, decreased IFN\u03b3 expression and reduced Teff function when compared to Teff from the non-asthmatic twin. Finally, report of current exposure to second hand smoke was associated with modifications in both Treg and Teff at the transcriptional level among asthmatics. The results of the current study provide evidence for differential function of T cell subsets in monozygotic twins discordant for asthma that are regulated by changes in DNA methylation. Our preliminary data suggest exposure to second hand smoke may augment the modified T cell responses associated with asthma.",

Septal defects were most common. 20% of infants with heart defects had twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) versus 8% of infants without defects (P<0.01); this association remained significant when controlling for potential confounders.\nThe prevalence of CHDs in this large cohort of MC twins was significantly higher than the general population rate, with TTTS an added risk factor.",

    "abstract": "Childhood adverse experiences are known to induce persistent changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity to stress. However, the mechanisms by which these experiences shape the neuroendocrine response to stress remain unclear. Method We tested whether bullying victimization influenced serotonin transporter gene (SERT) DNA methylation using a discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin design. A subsample of 28 MZ twin pairs discordant for bullying victimization, with data on cortisol and DNA methylation, were identified in the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally representative 1994-1995 cohort of families with twins.\nBullied twins had higher SERT DNA methylation at the age of 10 years compared with their non-bullied MZ co-twins. This group difference cannot be attributed to the children's genetic makeup or their shared familial environments because of the study design. Bullied twins also showed increasing methylation levels between the age of 5 years, prior to bullying victimization, and the age of 10 years whereas no such increase was detected in non-bullied twins across time. Moreover, children with higher SERT methylation levels had blunted cortisol responses to stress.\nOur study extends findings drawn from animal models, supports the hypothesis that early-life stress modifies DNA methylation at a specific cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site in the SERT promoter and HPA functioning and suggests that these two systems may be functionally associated.",

    "abstract": "Aim. To identify risk factors for urticaria, to determine the relative proportion of the susceptibility to urticaria that is due to genetic factors in an adult clinical twin sample, and to further determine whether the genetic susceptibility to urticaria overlaps with the genetic susceptibility to atopic diseases. Methods. A total of 256 complete twin pairs and 63 single twins, who were selected from sibships with self-reported asthma via a questionnaire survey of 21,162 adult twins from the Danish Twin Registry, were clinically interviewed about a history of urticaria and examined for atopic diseases. Data were analysed with Cox proportional hazards regression and variance components models. Results. A total of 151 individuals (26%) had a history of urticaria, whereas 24 (4%) had had symptoms within the past year. Female sex, HR = 2.09 (1.46-2.99), P = 0.000; hay fever, HR = 1.92 (1.36-2.72), P = 0.000; and atopic dermatitis, HR = 1.44 (1.02-2.06), P = 0.041 were significant risk factors for urticaria. After adjustment for sex and age at onset of urticaria in the index twin, the risk of urticaria was increased in MZ cotwins relative to DZ cotwins, HR = 1.42 (0.63-3.18), P = 0.394. Genetic factors explained 45% (16-74%), P = 0.005, of the variation in susceptibility to urticaria. The genetic correlation between urticaria and hay fever was 0.45 (0.01-0.89), P = 0.040. Conclusions. Susceptibility to urticaria is partly determined by genetic factors. Urticaria is more common in women, and in subjects with hay fever and atopic dermatitis, and shares genetic variance with hay fever.",

    "abstract": "The disposable soma theory proposes a trade-off between fertility and longevity but existing findings on this association have been mixed. This study used data from 15,622 twins born between 1901 and 1925 ascertained from the population-based Swedish Twin Registry to test the child-longevity association and whether it is accounted for by individual-level factors or by genetic and environmental factors shared by family members. Based on survival analysis, both women and men with children had significantly longer survival relative to the childless, with a slightly higher relative advantage in men. Adjustments for demographic factors and cotwin fertility did not mediate the parenting-survival association, indicating that this association is attributable to individual-level factors associated with fertility rather than family-level environmental or genetic factors shared by cotwins. These results, derived from a large, population-based sample, are inconsistent with the disposable soma theory as applied to modern human populations.",

We performed ultrasound assessment and found that the twins shared the liver and that the fusion site of their liver had gross communication of blood vessel. Ultrasound cardiogram examination showed that the anomalous vessels that connected their hearts drained from the number 1 infant to the number 2 infant. The ultrasound assessment has significant impact on the successful surgical separation of the thoraco-omphalopagus twins.",

    "abstract": "Aortic coarctation is a congenital defect which rarely presents in adulthood but results in significant morbidity and mortality. Endovascular techniques present novel therapeutic options for managing this anomaly with comparable results to traditional open surgical repair.\nWe convey a case of postductal aortic coarctation in a symptomatic 31-year-old woman, undetected, despite 27 years history of congenital bicuspid valve with aortic incompetence. We staged a successful endovascular repair following presentation with hypertension, abdominal pain, and worsening lower limb claudication. This lady recovered well, eventually giving birth to twins after a successful caesarean section delivery. The anatomical, clinical and technical features of the case are appraised.\nAortic coarctation is classified anatomically as preductal (infantile) or postductal (adult) and the morphological spectrum of abnormality ranges from a discrete stenosis distal to the left subclavian to a hypoplastic transverse arch and aortic isthmus presenting in infancy. Its incidence is 0.2-0.6 per 100 live births. Traditional open surgical repair of aortic coarctation is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Advances in endovascular techniques with their associated shorter hospital time and lower costs, reduced short term morbidity and mortality mean that they are likely to become mainstays of treatment.\nThe presentation of aortic coarctation for the first time in an adult is extremely unusual. Error and delayed diagnosis can never be fully exempted in the practice of medicine even with the most advanced diagnostic tools. Follow-up is mandatory by trans-oesophageal echo in all endovascular patients.",

Recent reports have shown that there are genomic and epigenomic differences between monozygotic twins. Genomic/epigenomic and gene expression analyses were performed in monozygotic twins discordant for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) to find the genes playing important roles in SLE pathogenesis. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and copy number variation (CNV) typing, CpG methylation and gene expression were analyzed. The discordances in SNPs and CNVs were not confirmed. Both CpG methylation and gene expression levels were different for 10 genes. There were no genomic differences between monozygotic twins discordant for SLE, but epigenomic and gene expression differences were detected. These findings provide information for better understanding of SLE pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiota acts like a virtual organ and is suggested to be of great importance in human energy balance and weight control. This study included 40 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs to investigate the influence of the human genotype on GI microbiota structure as well as microbial signatures for differences in body mass index (BMI). Phylogenetic microarraying based on 16S rRNA genes demonstrated that MZ twins have more similar microbiotas compared with unrelated subjects (P<0.001), which allowed the identification of 35 genus-like microbial groups that are more conserved between MZ twins. Half of the twin pairs were selected on discordance in terms of BMI, which revealed an inverse correlation between Clostridium cluster IV diversity and BMI. Furthermore, relatives of Eubacterium ventriosum and Roseburia intestinalis were positively correlated to BMI differences, and relatives of Oscillospira guillermondii were negatively correlated to BMI differences. Lower BMI was associated with a more abundant network of primary fiber degraders, while a network of butyrate producers was more prominent in subjects with higher BMI. Combined with higher butyrate and valerate contents in the fecal matter of higher BMI subjects, the difference in microbial networks suggests a shift in fermentation patterns at the end of the colon, which could affect human energy homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "PRRT2 gene mutations have recently been identified as a causative gene of Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), a rare movement disorder characterised by the occurrence of chorea, dystonia or athetosis triggered by sudden action. Some patients have additional intermittent neurologic disorders like infantile convulsions. The association with migraine has been rarely reported in this condition. Here we report the coexistence of PKD and hemiplegic migraine in twins harbouring a heterozygous mutation in PRRT2. Two monozygotic twins manifesting PKD together with repeated episodes of migraine with some severe attacks of hemiplegic migraine have been followed and treated for more than 10 years. Molecular genetic analysis disclosed the c.649_650insC, p.R217Pfs*8 heterozygous mutation in both twins. This mutation was segregating from the mother who likewise harboured the same mutation c.649dupC although she had never manifested PKD but complained of rare common migraine attacks in her past history. The association of PKD and hemiplegic migraine has been previously reported in one large family, associated to febrile convulsions and afebrile seizures in some individuals, but our report relates this association of symptoms to a mutation in PRRT2. The co-occurrence of both hemiplegic migraine and PKD in monozygotic twins expands the phenotypic spectrum of intermittent manifestations related to PRRT2 and perhaps suggests an additional causing gene for hemiplegic migraine.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a diagnosis with a set of symptoms of aberrant psychological phenomena. Here, we discuss that there may be an imbalance of proteostasis of neurons in the brain leading to increase in membrane shedding and buildup of microparticles (MPs) appearing in the cerebrospinal fluid. The number of MPs can be determined and their phenotypes verified by size and membrane expression with flow cytometry. This is the first report of specified MPs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in schizophrenia. Two 56-year-old Swedish-born female monozygotic twins of Caucasian ethnicity with onset of schizophrenia more than 30years ago were studied. Three fractions of fresh CSF were examined for microparticles by flow cytometry analysis, which measure the specific binding of antibodies to CD42a (platelet-MP; 33 GPIX), CD144 (endothelial-MP; Ve-cadherin), CD45 (leukocyte-MP; pan-leukocyte antigen) and of phosphatidylserine to lactadherin. The patients with schizophrenia displayed more phosphatidylserine-positive MPs in CSF compared with healthy control subjects. The scanning electron microscopic (SEM) structures in CSF studied over a 3-year period in twins with schizophrenia were of similar appearance at both time points. The increased number of MPs in fresh CSF may be a sign of enhanced membrane shedding in the central nervous system. Such MPs can be investigated for both human and non-human DNA, RNA and microRNA that may activate different immune signaling systems in patients with schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Rates of twinning have risen dramatically over the last 30 years, from 1 in 53 births in 1980 to 1 in 30 births in 2009 (Martin et al. (January 2012). Three decades of twin births in the United States, 1980-2009. Atlanta, GA: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics). This increase is largely attributable to increases in the use of fertility treatments (i.e., ovulation induction and in vitro fertilization) combined with delays in parenthood. Although this increase means that more twins are available for recruitment into twin studies, it also has potential consequences for the heritability estimates obtained in these studies. This study sought to evaluate this possibility, making use of the ongoing Michigan Twins Project (N = 7,261 families with twins aged 3-17 years), an arm of the Michigan State University Twin Registry. Results revealed that, on average, twins conceived via fertility treatments had lower rates of behavior problems than those conceived naturally, although these behavioral differences could be explained largely by demographic and socio-economic differences across the two types of twin families. Twin similarity did not meaningfully differ across fertility treatment status. We thus conclude that estimates of genetic and environmental influences obtained from twin studies over the last 10-15 years are more or less unaffected by the inclusion of twins conceived via fertility treatments in their samples.",

    "abstract": "The Peri/postnatal Epigenetic Twins Study (PETS) is a longitudinal cohort of 250 pairs of Australian twins and their mothers, who were recruited mid-way through pregnancy from January 2007 to September 2009. The study is centered on the developmental origins of health and disease paradigm (DOHaD) in which an adverse intrauterine environment predisposes the individual to complex disease in later life by reducing growth in utero and adversely altering developmental plasticity. Data concerning diet and lifestyle were collected from mothers during pregnancy, and samples of plasma and serum taken at 28 weeks' gestation. We attended 75% of all births, at which time we collected multiple biological samples including placenta, cord blood, and neonatal cheek cells, the latter from 91% of pairs. Chorionicity was recorded and zygosity was determined by DNA testing where necessary. Approximately 40% of the twins are monozygotic, two-thirds of which are dichorionic. Twins were seen again at 18 months of age and repeat blood and cheek swabs taken where possible. Studies of gene expression and the epigenetic marks of DNA methylation have so far revealed that twins exhibit a wide range of epigenetic discordance at birth, that one-third of the epigenome changes significantly between birth and 18 months; shared (maternal) environment, genetic factors, and non-shared intrauterine environment contribute to an increasing proportion of epigenetic variation at birth, respectively, and affect tissues differently, and that within-pair birth weight discordance correlates with epigenetic discordance in genes associated with lipid metabolism, supporting an epigenetic mechanism for DOHaD.",

The decrease of brain volume starts from the very onset of multiple sclerosis and is 10-fold compared with normal aging. The aim of this study was to assess whether the brain and spinal cord volumes and the volume of white matter lesions differed between twins with multiple sclerosis and their asymptomatic co-twins.\nA co-twin control method was used to evaluate whether the brain and spinal cord volumes differ between twins with multiple sclerosis and their co-twins. Nineteen twin pairs were studied neurologically, and the volumes of T1, T2, FLAIR, and gadolinium-enhanced lesions and those of the brain and the spinal cord were obtained by magnetic resonance imaging.\nSignificant differences in the brain (P=0.064) or spinal cord (P=0.648) volumes were not detected. Four of the 7 monozygotic and 5 of the 12 dizygotic co-twins had focal brain white matter lesions, but none fulfilled the magnetic resonance imaging criteria of Barkhof. Spinal cord lesions were not seen in any of the co-twins.\nThe absence of a significant difference in the brain or spinal cord volume between the twins with multiple sclerosis and their co-twins supports the recent observation of brain size and the development of brain atrophy being highly heritable.",

    "abstract": "The separation of craniopagus conjoined twins is a very rare and complex challenge. As with many rare challenges, it presents initially as a deceptively simple problem requiring only the most basic clinical techniques. As in many reconstructive problems, this paradigm mandates that the neurosurgical team performs the separation with the plastic surgeons providing closure at the end of the separation. Historically, these approaches have included, as with the separation of many other types of conjoined twins, the use of tissue expansion before separation followed by separation surgery. In the best hands, at the most capable medical centers, the mortality reported in the literature for the past 50 years is greater than 50%. Craniofacial surgery frequently demands a coordinated effort between plastic surgery and neurosurgery and many other specializations; separating craniopagus twins takes this coordination to a stratospheric level. It is, however, this coordination that is of paramount importance. Success clearly requires an understanding of the complex interrelationship between the \"separation\" and the \"reconstruction\" and that decisions made for 1 aspect of the surgery will have a profound impact on another aspect of the surgery. The impact can be disastrous or, if planned well, can be advantageous.We were contacted to evaluate craniopagus conjoined male infant twins for separation. Radiographic studies suggested that the brains were separate, and their medical team suggested that they were \"fit for separation.\" We reviewed the literature and reviewed our colleagues' experiences with similar cases around the world. It became clear that whether separation had been unsuccessful or successful, a variety of issues accompanied surgery as follows: (1) massive intraoperative hemorrhage, (2) cerebral edema, (3) venous infarcts, (4) swelling of flaps, and (5) dehiscence of repairs with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, meningitis, or brain exposure. Although the initial plan was to separate the twins in the same fashion as in previous cases (ie, single-stage separation surgery preceded by tissue expansion of the scalp), it was clear that this approach increases cerebral venous pressure during the separation component of surgery and therefore set up a cascade of events favoring failure rather than success. Wishing to favor success, we elected to design an open-ended multistaged separation to improve venous collateral circulation. We believe that this would improve venous drainage, prevent increased venous pressure, diminish cerebral edema, and favor the integrity of the dura and flap repair that would in turn lessen the risk of CSF leak. The stages would also allow the twins to recover from each stage before progressing to the next stage while continuing to receive nutritional support and physical therapy. Four major stages for 9 \u00bd months led to their successful separation. There has been no CSF leak or meningitis. To our knowledge, this technique has since been applied to 2 other sets of craniopagus with similar outcomes.A review of the pertinent literature, our rationale, and methodology are discussed in this article.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes home sleeping arrangements used by parents of twins and investigates whether room sharing (twins in the same room as parents) or cobedding (crib-sharing between twins) influences parental night time sleep duration or sleep quality. A secondary analysis of data obtained from a longitudinal study of sleep in 104 families with twins was undertaken. Over 65% of twins were cobedded at 4 weeks; this decreased to approximately 42% by 13 weeks of age. Approximately 64% of families practiced room sharing at 4 weeks, this decreased to approximately 40% by 13 weeks of age. Mothers and fathers who both room shared and cobedded their twins at 9 weeks of age were most likely to experience restricted sleep duration when compared to other sleeping arrangements. Results suggest that parents of twins may not be following the most recent AAP recommendations regarding safe infant sleep for multiple birth infants.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins, 27 years old, with primary anti-phospholipid syndrome have been described. The first of the twins had obstetric morbidities (one miscarriage at 12 weeks and premature birth of a growth-restricted fetus at 27 weeks secondary to pre-eclampsia) and the second had venous thrombosis. Lupus anticoagulant was present in both and anti-cardiolipin antibodies were present in high titres when re-tested at appropriate intervals. Development of clinical features of APS in monozygotic twins points to an underlying genetic basis in the pathogenesis of anti-phospholipid syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Identifying genetic and metabolic biomarkers in neonates has the potential to improve diagnosis and treatment of common complex neonatal diseases, and potentially lead to risk assessment and preventative measures for common adulthood illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is a wealth of information on using fatty acid, amino acid and organic acid metabolite profiles to identify rare inherited congenital diseases through newborn screening, but little is known about these metabolic profiles in the context of the 'healthy' newborn. Recent studies have implicated many of the amino acid and fatty acid metabolites utilized in newborn screening in common complex adult diseases such as cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and obesity. To determine the heritability of metabolic profiles in newborns, we examined 381 twin pairs obtained from the Iowa Neonatal Metabolic Screening Program. Heritability was estimated using multilevel mixed-effects linear regression adjusting for gestational age, gender, weight and age at time of sample collection. The highest heritability was for short-chain acylcarnitines, specifically C4 (h\u00b2=0.66, P=2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076), C4-DC (h\u00b2=0.83, P<10\u207b\u00b9\u2076) and C5 (h\u00b2=0.61, P=1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079). Thyroid stimulating hormone (h\u00b2=0.58, P=2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075) and immunoreactive trypsinogen (h\u00b2=0.52, P=3 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079) also have a strong genetic component. This is direct evidence for a strong genetic contribution to the metabolic profile at birth and that newborn screening data can be utilized for studying the genetic regulation of many clinically relevant metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Studies of synchronous physiological responses to startle stimuli between monozygotic twins and other paired subjects have suffered from methodological flaws such as post-hoc specifications of \"connectedness\" criteria. The mechanisms that affect any such connectedness are unknown. With the logistic and financial support of a television company, we conducted a methodological pilot study with predefined objective hit criteria in which we used four pairs of twins with frequent experiences of connectedness.\nWhile one twin was exposed during a 12-minute period to five randomly presented mild shock or surprise stimuli, the electrodermal activity, blood pressure, breathing, and bodily movements were simultaneously recorded in the second twin. An authorized polygraph expert who was blind to the stimulus exposure times examined the data for deviations from normal physiological patterns during relaxation and delivered precisely timed estimates of such deviations. \"Hits\" (indications of connectedness) were objectively defined as an estimate lying within a 15-second \"hit window.\"\nOverall results were nonsignificant, P > .7. However, for one pair of twins, the polygraph expert identified 10 deviating patterns, of which three were hits were P < .03. This data set was sent to a second, independent expert, who blindly identified the same three hits, pointing to only eight patterns, P < .0003.\nWe argue that the applied methodology for \"hit\" identification is objective and recommendable. Speculatively, because the \"successful\" pair of twins was reported to be monochorionic-monoamnionic (as embryos, they shared the same placenta and the same bag of water), embryonic history might be further investigated as a potential factor for connectedness between monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies in twins indicate that non-shared environment, beyond genetic factors, contributes substantially to individual variation in mutagen sensitivity; however, the role of specific causative factors (e.g. tobacco smoke, diet) was not elucidated. In this investigation, a population of 22 couples of monozygotic twins with discordant smoking habits was selected with the aim of evaluating the influence of tobacco smoke on individual response to DNA damage. The study design virtually eliminated the contribution of genetic heterogeneity to the intra-pair variation in DNA damage response, and thus any difference in the end-points investigated could directly be attributed to the non-shared environment experienced by co-twins, which included as main factor cigarette smoke exposure. Peripheral lymphocytes of study subjects were challenged ex vivo with \u03b3-rays, and the induction, processing, fixation of DNA damage evaluated through multiple approaches. Folate status of study subjects was considered significant covariate since it is affected by smoking habits and can influence radiosensitivity. Similar responses were elicited by \u03b3-rays in co-twins for all the end-points analysed, despite their discordant smoking habits. Folate status did not modify DNA damage response, even though a combined effect of smoking habits, low-plasma folic acid level, and ionising radiation was observed on apoptosis. A possible modulation of DNA damage response by duration and intensity of tobacco smoke exposure was suggested by Comet assay and micronucleus data, but the effect was quantitatively limited. Overall, the results obtained indicate that differences in smoking habits do not contribute to a large extent to inter-individual variability in the response to radiation-induced DNA damage observed in healthy human populations.",

    "abstract": "To gain widespread participation, epidemiologic studies of twins from pregnancy through the childhood period are expected to reflect the needs and concerns of families and provide participants with appropriate and useful feedback based on scientific evidence. Our most recent database on families with twins throughout Japan is based on a questionnaire survey conducted from January 2010 to August 2011. Mailed or hand-delivered questionnaires, consisting of over 550 items were used to collect the basic data. The response rate was 40% (956/2,401). This is part of a nation-wide study designed to assess the long-term effect of perinatal conditions on mothers of multiples. Its aim was to study the growth and development of multiples in childhood, and to conduct a genetic epidemiologic study to test the developmental origin of health and disease hypothesis. One of the ultimate aims of this research was to provide evidence-based information on parenting multiples from pregnancy through childhood to families with multiples.",

    "abstract": "This article profiles the historical twin databases of the secondary education school attached to the Faculty of Education at the University of Tokyo. The school was established in 1948. Every year, about 50 pairs of twins of all sex and zygosity combinations and aged 11-12 years take an examination, and about 10-20 pairs are admitted based on the results. Three data sets exist: one for applicants (11-12 years), one for junior and senior high school students (12-18 years), and one for graduates (18-79 years). Record linkage of these three databases should facilitate several important research projects; for example, the lifecourse genetic epidemiologic studies and verification of so-called developmental origin of health and disease hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Exercise-induced positive changes in skeletal muscle properties and metabolism decrease the risk for disability, cardiometabolic diseases and mortality. Here, we studied muscle properties and glucose homeostasis in a non-exercise stage in twin pairs with co-twins discordant for physical activity habits for at least 32 years of their adult lives. Isometric knee extension force, MR imaging of midthigh tissue composition and muscle volume, and fasting blood samples were acquired from 16 same-sex (seven monozygotic, nine dizygotic) middle-aged and older twin pairs. The consistently active twins had 20 % higher knee extension forces than their inactive co-twins (p = 0.006) although the active twins had only 4 % higher midthigh muscle cross-sectional areas (p = 0.072). These results were similar in intrapair analysis in which only the seven identical twin pairs were included. The ratio between the area of midthigh fat and muscle tissues was significantly lower among the active twins (0.65 vs. 0.48, p = 0.006). The active twins had also lower fasting plasma glucose levels (5.1 vs 5.6 mmol/l, p = 0.041). The area of midthigh intramuscular (extramyocellular) fat was associated with the markers of glucose homeostasis, especially with glycated hemoglobin, and these associations were emphasized by the diabetic and inactive twins. Regular exercise throughout the adult life retains muscle strength and quality but not necessarily mass. The regular use of muscles also prevents from the accumulation of intramuscular fat which might be related to maintained glucose metabolism and, thus, prevention of metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have identified phenotypic associations between Cloninger's temperament dimensions and the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults. However the underlying aetiology of these associations remains unclear. We investigate the extent to which genetic and environmental influences contribute to the relationship between temperament and ADHD, examining the ADHD symptoms of inattention (IA) and hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI) separately. Participants were 886 adult twin pairs aged 19-20 years. ADHD symptoms of IA and HI were measured using a DSM-IV based rating scale. Temperament was measured using Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), across four dimensions: novelty seeking (NS), harm avoidance (HA), reward dependence (RD) and persistence (PS). The twin method was used to decompose phenotypic variance/covariance among these variables into genetic and environmental components. We found that NS was genetically associated with both ADHD symptom dimensions (IA and HI), but that HA was genetically associated with IA only. There was also some evidence of genetic association between PS, IA and HI. These findings suggest that unique profiles of temperament are genetically related to the two ADHD symptom dimensions in adults. Further work is now needed to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie both the combined and separate symptom factor domains of ADHD.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies indicate an association between sleep problems and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Although both these conditions separately have moderate heritabilities, confounding by genetic factors has not previously been taken into account. This study aimed to reveal the association between sleep problems and GERD, while adjusting for heredity and other potential confounding factors.\nThis cross-sectional population-based study included all 8,014 same-sexed twins of at least 65 years of age and born in Sweden between 1886 and 1958, who participated in telephone interviews in 1998-2002. Three logistic regression models were used 1) external control analysis, 2) within-pair co-twin analysis with dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs discordant for GERD, and 3) within-pair co-twin analysis with monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for GERD. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and adjusted for established risk factors for GERD, i.e. sex, age, body mass index (BMI), tobacco smoking, and educational level.\nA dose-response association was identified between increasing levels of sleep problems and GERD in the external control analysis. Individuals who often experienced sleep problems had a two-fold increased occurrence of GERD compared to those who seldom had sleep problems (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.8-2.4). The corresponding association was of similar strength in the co-twin analysis including 356 DZ pairs (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.6-3.4), and in the co-twin analysis including 210 MZ pairs (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.9-2.7).\nA dose-dependent association between sleep problems and GERD remains after taking heredity and other known risk factors for GERD into account.",

    "abstract": "The Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) is a large longitudinal sample of twins born in England and Wales between 1994 and 1996. The focus of TEDS has been on cognitive and behavioral development, including difficulties in the context of normal development. TEDS began when multiple births were identified from birth records and the families were invited to take part in the study; 16,810 pairs of twins were originally enrolled in TEDS. More than 10,000 of these twin pairs remain enrolled in the study to date. DNA has been collected for more than 7,000 pairs, and genome-wide genotyping data for two million DNA markers are available for 3,500 individuals. The TEDS families have taken part in studies when the twins were aged 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, and 16 years of age. Data collection is currently underway to assess the adult destinations of the twins as they move from school to university and the workplace. Between January 2012 and December 2014, all of the TEDS twins will turn 18, and the study will transition to an adult sample. TEDS represents an outstanding resource for investigating the developmental effects of genes and environments on complex quantitative traits from childhood to young adulthood and beyond.",

    "abstract": "How regular and irregular verbs are processed remains a matter of debate. Some English-speaking patients with nonfluent aphasia are especially impaired on regular past-tense forms like played, whether the task requires production, comprehension or even the judgement that \"play\" and \"played\" sound different. Within a dual-mechanism account of inflectional morphology, these deficits reflect disruption to the rule-based process that adds (or strips) the suffix -ed to regular verb stems; but the fact that the patients are also impaired at detecting the difference between word pairs like \"tray\" and \"trade\" (the latter being a phonological but not a morphological twin to \"played\") suggests an important role for phonological characteristics of the regular past tense. The present study examined MEG brain responses in healthy participants evoked by spoken regular past-tense forms and phonological twin words (plus twin pseudowords and a non-speech control) presented in a passive oddball paradigm. Deviant forms (played, trade, kwade/kwayed) relative to their standards (play, tray, kway) elicited a pronounced neuromagnetic response at approximately 130 ms after the onset of the affix; this response was maximal at sensors over temporal areas of both hemispheres but stronger on the left, especially for played and kwayed. Relative to the same standards, a different set of deviants ending in /t/--plate, trait and kwate--produced stronger difference responses especially over the right hemisphere. Results are discussed with regard to dual- and single-mechanism theories of past tense processing and the need to consider neurobiological evidence in attempts to understand inflectional morphology.",

    "abstract": "Studies of schizophrenia inheritance in identical twins show a concordance of about 50%, which supports an epigenetic model. In our present study we investigated methylation of genomic DNA and promoter methylation of Reelin and SOX10 genes in peripheral blood of twins suffering from schizophrenia. Global DNA methylation was reduced (52.3%) in schizophrenic twins if compared with healthy control twins (65.7%). The reduced methylation was significant in males only. We also found a similar hypomethylation in the non-affected twins of discordant pairs and a mixed group of psychiatric controls. In discordant twins there was a relative hypermethylation of the SOX10 promoter. Within-pair-difference of methylation of Reelin promoter was significantly lower in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Allergic colitis (AC) typically develops in the first weeks or months of life and is characterized by the presence of red blood in the stools of healthy breastfed or formula fed infants. In this paper, we describe a case of rectal bleeding in monozygotic preterm twins that was resolved with the introduction of a cow's milk protein-free diet (CMPFD). The occurrence of this disorder in monozygotic twins raises the question as to whether the underlying abnormality in the immune regulation, which leads to poor acquisition of tolerance to cow's milk proteins, might be inherited or environmentally acquired. The case also highlights the use of the probiotic Lactobacillus GG (LGG) in the treatment of allergic colitis.",

    "abstract": "Does the intergenerational influence on birthweight and birth length remain within female dizygotic and monozygotic twin pairs?\nThe intergenerational influence on birthweight and birth length remained within dizygotic but not within monozygotic twin pairs.\nLow birthweight is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in both the short and long term; therefore it is important to understand determinants of fetal growth. There is a known intergenerational association between parents' and offspring's size at birth.\nThis is a register-based cohort study with a nested within-twin-pair comparison. The study is retrospective, but based on prospectively collected information. The study population included 8685 monozygotic and like-sexed dizygotic female twins born in Sweden from 1926 to 1985, who had given birth to their first infant between 1973 and 2009.\nThis study is set in Sweden and used data from the Swedish Twin Register and the Swedish Medical Birth Register. We used generalized estimating equations to obtain regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the outcomes: offspring birthweight and birth length. To control for genetic and shared environmental factors, we performed within-twin-pair analyses in 1479 dizygotic and 1526 monozygotic twin pairs.\nIn the cohort of both dizygotic and monozygotic twins, there was an association between mother's and offspring's size at birth. Within-dizygotic twin pairs, a 500-g increase from the twin pair's mean birthweight was associated with increased offspring birthweight [70 g (95% CI: 35-106)] and birth length [0.22 cm (95% CI: 0.07-0.38)]. The corresponding increase in birth length of 1 cm was estimated to increase offspring's birthweight by 26 g (95% CI: 12-40) and birth length by 0.11 cm (95% CI: 0.04-0.17). Within-monozygotic twin pairs there were no such associations.\nThis study is limited to twins who themselves or whose co-twin voluntarily responded to questionnaires.\nThe intergenerational influence on size at birth is suggested to be due to direct or indirect genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Human intelligence, as measured by intelligence quotient (IQ) tests, demonstrates one of the highest heritabilities among human quantitative traits. Nevertheless, studies to identify quantitative trait loci responsible for intelligence face challenges because of the small effect sizes of individual genes. Phenotypically discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins provide a feasible way to minimize the effects of irrelevant genetic and environmental factors, and should yield more interpretable results by finding epigenetic or gene expression differences between twins. Here we conducted array-based genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression analyses using 17 pairs of healthy MZ twins discordant intelligently. ARHGAP18, related to Rho GTPase, was identified in pair-wise methylation status analysis and validated via direct bisulfite sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR. To perform expression profile analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) between the groups of twins with higher IQ and their co-twins revealed up-regulated expression of several ribosome-related genes and DNA replication-related genes in the group with higher IQ. To focus more on individual pairs, we conducted pair-wise GSEA and leading edge analysis, which indicated up-regulated expression of several ion channel-related genes in twins with lower IQ. Our findings implied that these groups of genes may be related to IQ and should shed light on the mechanism underlying human intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Individual's hearing performance after cochlear implant (CI) is variable and depends on different factors such as etiology of deafness, age at implantation, and social/family hearing environment. Here we report the case of dizygotic twins, boy and girl, presenting with neurosensorial profound deafness prior CI (age of implantation = 3.5 years old). Both parents have severe/profound deafness, since childhood, and use sign language as primary mode of communication. Clinical and genetic characterization was performed, as well as the assessment of the auditory and oral (re)habilitation after CI, applying a battery of audiological, speech, and language tests. The twin girl and the father were homozygous for the c.35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene, while the twin boy and the mother were compound heterozygotes, both monoallelic for c.35delG and for the deletion del(GJB6-D13S1830) in the GJB6 gene. The remaining hearing impaired relatives were c.35delG homozygotes. The genetic cause of deafness was thus identified in this family. Some noteworthy differences were observed regarding twins' auditory and oral performance after CI. Subsequent follow-up of these children allowed us to conclude that those differences were most likely due to the different environment in which the twins have been living than to their different GJB2/GJB6 genotypes.",

In order to investigate the heredity of the mutation, we measured the ratio of the mutated mtDNA molecule among 32 families of identical twins. Both twins from one family showed 20.16% and 18.49% mutated molecules, and the level is significantly high in comparison with members of other families and control subjects (0.23-0.86%). Their parents, however, showed normal level of mutated molecules (0.70% and 0.66%). The high-level mutation of the twins may be due to a spontaneous event, which occurred during development of germ line of their mother, or oogenesis of their mother, or during early stage of their development.",

    "abstract": "Submicroscopic 6p25 deletion is now recognized as a clinically identifiable syndrome, characterized by intellectual disability, language impairment, hearing deficit, craniofacial, ophthalmologic, cardiac, and varying central nervous system anomalies. We report on two dyzogotic twins with a maternal segregating hemizygous interstitial deletion on chromosome 6p25.1, spanning 0.9\u00a0kb; the smallest ever reported. Both had dysmorphic features (prominence of the metopic suture, synophrys, hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, tented mouth), and a distinct brain MRI, showing a focal significant increase of the right peri-frontal subarachnoid space, with shallow sulci and a mild anomaly of the gyral pattern. Such brain anomaly has never been reported in association with del 6p25. Both propositi had a borderline-mild intellectual disability, speech and language difficulties, and behavior abnormalities. Their mother, formally tested, had a borderline cognitive impairment. Although none of the genes mapping to the deleted region are apparently related to the phenotype, LYRM4 resulted down-regulated in the cerebellar cortex of schizophrenia patients compared with controls, and Lyrm4 was down-regulated in the prefrontal cortex of mice with microdeletions in the locus syntenic to human 22q11.2 patients affected by schizophrenia. These data are in agreement with the emerging concept that similar CNVs are pathogenic in patients affected by distinct neurological diseases, and that these loci are more general risk factors for different disorders. The resemblance of our patients to those with the more extensive 6p25.1p25.3 terminal deletion suggests that the gene/s responsible for the physical phenotype should reside in the 6p25.1 genomic region.",

We have characterized inter- and intra-individual variation of microbial communities of 107 individuals in one of the largest cohorts to date (264 saliva samples), using culture-independent 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. We examined the salivary microbiome in up to three time-points during 10 yr spanning adolescence, and determined the influence of human genotype, gender, age, and weight class. Participants, including 27 monozygotic and 18 dizygotic twin pairs, were sampled mainly at ages 12-13, 17-18, and 22-24, with a few sampled as early as 8 yr of age. In contrast to gut or skin microbiomes, there is a core genus-level salivary microbiome. Individuals are more similar to themselves and their co-twins in the 12-17 and in the 17-22 cohorts than to the whole sample population, but not over the 10 yr from 12 to 22; and monozygotic twin pairs are statistically not more similar than dizygotic twin pairs. The data are most consistent with shared environment serving as the main determinant of microbial populations. Twins resemble each other more closely than the whole population at all time-points, but become less similar to each other when they age and no longer cohabit. Several organisms have age-specific abundance profiles, including members of the genera Veillonella, Actinomyces, and Streptococcus. There is no clear effect of weight class and gender. The results of this work will provide a basis to further study oral microbes and human health.",

    "abstract": "Chest circumference (CC) is suggested to be a good indicator of early life nutrition, but little is known on the heritability of CC. Thus we analysed the effects of genetic and environmental factors on the development of CC in Japanese infants.\nCC was measured longitudinally from birth until 1 year of age in a cohort of 211 monozygotic and 160 dizygotic complete Japanese twin pairs born in 1989-2002. The data were analysed using applications of structural linear equation modelling for twin data.\nNo sex-specific differences in the variance components were found. Environmental factors unique to each twin explained the major part of the variation of CC at birth whereas environmental factors shared by co-twins were more important at 1-3 months of age. From 3 months of age, the effect of genetic factors become steadily stronger and they explained the majority of the variation at 1 year of age. Strong genetic continuity in the development of CC was found, but also new sets of genes were activated during the first year of life. The origin of the environmental part of the variation could be tracked before 3 months of age. A substantial part of common and specific environmental factors affecting CC affected also birthweight.\nCC is sensitive to intrauterine environmental factors, but these effects diminish during the first year of life, at least if postnatal environment is good. CC can be a useful indicator when identifying newborns who have suffered suboptimal pre-natal conditions.",

    "abstract": "Although discordant phenotypes in monozygotic twins with developmental disorder are not an exception, underlying genetic discordance is rarely reported. Here, we report on the clinical and cytogenetic details of 4-year-old female monozygotic twins with discordant phenotypes. Twin 1 exhibited global developmental delay, overweight and hyperactivity. Twin 2 had an autistic spectrum disorder. Molecular karyotyping in twin 1 identified a 2p25.3 deletion, further confirmed by Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on leukocytes. Interestingly, array comparative genomic hybridization was normal in twin 2 but FISH analysis using the same probe as twin 1 showed mosaicism with one-third of cells with a 2p25.3 deletion, one-third of cells with a 2p25.3 duplication, and one-third of normal cells. Genotyping with microsatellite markers confirmed the monozygosity of the twins. We propose that the chromosome imbalance may be due to a mitotic non-allelic recombination occurring during blastomeric divisions of a normal zygote. Such event will result in three distinct cell populations, whose proportion in each embryo formed after separation from the zygote may differ, leading to discordant chromosomal anomalies between twins. We also discuss that the MYTL1L and the SNTG2 genes within the reported region could probably relate to the phenotypic discordance of the monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "Total muscle triglyceride (MT) content has been associated with insulin resistance. We investigated the predictors and impact of MT on relevant metabolic parameters including peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance in elderly twins.\nSeventy-four elderly same-sex twins underwent hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps preceded by an iv glucose tolerance test. Aerobic capacity (VO2max) and body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan) were determined in all twins. A biopsy from the vastus lateralis muscle was excised in the fasting state. The muscle triacylglycerol content was analyzed by biochemical extraction from these biopsies.\nThe percentage of total body fat was the only independent predictor of MT content. After adjustment for trunk fat percentages and sex, MT level was significantly associated to fasting plasma levels of glucose and insulin as well as hepatic insulin resistance. However, the association was weakened after adjustment for total fat percentages. A 1 SD (34.5 mmol/kg dry weight) increase in MT content was associated with a 24% increase of hepatic insulin resistance. No association between MT content and peripheral insulin sensitivity was observed.\nMT content is associated with hepatic but not peripheral insulin resistance in elderly twins. We speculate that MT content may reflect the general ectopic accumulation of triglycerides, including fat in the liver.",

    "abstract": "Using whole blood from 15 twin pairs discordant for breast cancer and high-resolution (450K) DNA methylation analysis, we identified 403 differentially methylated CpG sites including known and novel potential breast cancer genes. Confirming the results in an independent validation cohort of 21 twin pairs determined the docking protein DOK7 as a candidate for blood-based cancer diagnosis. DNA hypermethylation of the promoter region was also seen in primary breast cancer tissues and cancer cell lines. Hypermethylation of DOK7 occurs years before tumor diagnosis, suggesting a role as a powerful epigenetic blood-based biomarker as well as providing insights into breast cancer pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Using scanning electron microscopy, microscopic structures have been identified in fresh cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but only rarely in control subjects. However, it has not been determined whether these microscopic particles represent state or trait markers, i.e. if their presence is related to clinical manifestations of the disease or if they also can be found in as yet asymptomatic individuals with a genetic liability. This question can be addressed by studying twins discordant or concordant for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.\nWe investigated microscopic structures in CSF in 102 individuals: 21 monozygotic and 16 dizygotic twins affected or not affected with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder and in 65 healthy singleton controls. A first and a second fraction of CSF was freshly applied on filters and examined by scanning electron microscopy technique. Spherical particles with lipid appearance averaging between 0.1 to 8.0 \u00b5m in diameter were detected in the center of the filter as well as located in the margins of larger aggregates binding in a viscous state. Structures were found in 12 of 17 probands, 5 of 12 healthy co-twins and 3 of 73 healthy controls. Thus, a positive microscopic finding significantly increased the likelihood of belonging to the proband group (OR=48, 95% CL: 8.2-550, p<0.0001) and the co-twin-group (OR=16, 95% CL: 2.0-218, p=0.006). Age, sex, history of alcohol abuse or anxiety syndrome, somatic disorder and markers of acute inflammatory activity did not account for group differences; nor did exposure to psychotropic medication.\nPresence of microscopic particles in CSF may possibly reflect trait dependent genetic or environmental vulnerability in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder.",

    "abstract": "This update on the Southern Illinois Twins and Siblings Study (SITSS) documents some of the follow-up studies that have been conducted and results that have been obtained from this sample. At the current time, 283 twin pairs, 8 triplet families, 98 non-twin sibling pairs, and 287 singletons have been enrolled in SITSS. Twins and triplets are tested as young as 1 year of age and then every year on their birthday through age 5 years. A variety of follow-up studies have been conducted for SITSS children through age 20. Results thus far have demonstrated significant genetic influences on social behaviors such as aggression, victimization, and attention toward facial expressions. Interesting interactions have been documented between the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) and the social environment (parental sensitivity or peer aggression) as they predict children's aggressive behaviors. In addition, increased difficulty with social interactions has been noted for twins versus singletons. Thus, this multi-trait, multi-method behavior genetic data set contributes to our understanding of the etiology of social behaviors in preschoolers and to predictors of similar behaviors through adolescence.",

    "abstract": "The Bielefeld Longitudinal Study of Adult Twins (BiLSAT) is a German longitudinal study of monozygotic and dizygotic twins reared together, including more than 1,100 twin pairs aged between 14 and 80 who participated in the first wave. Data were collected at five waves of assessment between 1993 and 2009. Initially, the study focused on genetic and environmental influences on the structure and the development in adult temperament and personality. Today, the study includes a broad range of individual variables, such as personality disorders, major life goals, interests, attitudes, values, life and work satisfaction, and major life events. A special feature of this genetically informative study lies in the multiple-rater approach (i.e., self-reports and peer reports). Longitudinal multiple-rater analyses allow researchers to go beyond the basic nature-nurture decomposition of variance in self-reports examining genetic and environmental influences on stability and change in more accurately measured individual attributes. In the current article, we briefly describe the design and contents of BiLSAT as well as some recent major findings and future plans.",

    "abstract": "To present prenatal diagnosis and molecular cytogenetic characterization of trisomy 18 in a monozygotic twin pregnancy, with one structurally abnormal living fetus and one intrauterine fetal demise.\nA 38-year-old woman was referred for amniocentesis at 16 weeks of gestation because of advanced maternal age. Prenatal ultrasound revealed a monozygotic twin pregnancy, with one structurally abnormal living fetus, and one fetal demise. The body structure details of the dead fetus could not be identified, whereas holoprosencephaly and omphalocele were identified in the living fetus on prenatal ultrasound. Quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction assays using polymorphic DNA markers specific for chromosome 21 and chromosome 18, were applied to the uncultured amniocytes in the amniotic cavity of the living fetus and the cultured amniocytes in the amniotic cavity of the fetus with intrauterine fetal demise. The specimen showed a dosage ratio of 2:1 (paternal:maternal) for chromosome 18-specific markers in both twins. The result was consistent with monozygosity and trisomy 18, and the trisomy 18 was possibly caused by a paternal second meiotic division non-disjunction error or a postzygotic mitotic error. Conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed a karyotype of 47,XY,+18 in both twins. The pregnancy was terminated at 19 weeks of gestation, and a 2g small-for-date macerated twin A and a 166g malformed twin B were delivered. Twin A manifested cebocephaly and omphalocele, and twin B manifested premaxillary agenesis and omphalocele.\nThe present case provides evidence that fetal wastage may occur in one of the co-twins in monozygotic twins associated with trisomy 18, and this may in part explain the very rare occurrence of living monozygotic twins with trisomy 18.",

    "abstract": "Dermatoglyphs are polygenetically determined epidermal ridge configurations on the fingers, palms and soles. An analysis of the digito-palmar dermatoglyphics obtained from 69 pairs of same-sex twins (32 monozygotic and 37 dizygotic) was performed in the population of Kosovo. Qualitative traits on the fingers (whorls, arches, radial and ulnar loops) and palms (pattern frequencies in the thenar/I, II, III and IV interdigital areas and hypothenar, the frequencies of positions of axial triradius) of both hands were analysed. The homolateral and heterolateral concordance of dermatoglyphic patterns between twin pairs were calculated for the monozygotic and dizygotic twins separately. The estimates of heritability for qualitative dermatoglyphic traits and the impacts of twin's shared (c(2)) and non-shared (individual) environments (e(2)) were presented. According to our results, the heritability patterns sharply distinguish highly heritable dermatoglyphic traits (patterns on the thenar and I interdigital area, II interdigital area and all the digits) and the traits with weak genetic component (patterns on the III and IV interdigital area, the hypothenar and the axial triradius position). In addition, the concordance and the heritability estimates in twins correspond to the embryonic growth of fingers (from the first to the fifth finger) and palm patterns (the II interdigital area). Based on findings presented here, we expect that the noxious environmental factors (possibly causing diseases later in life) would leave traces on the dermatoglyphs, which could be recognized as the increased dissimilarity of the twins (and other relatives) in the III and IV interdigital area, hypothenar, and in axial triradius position.",

    "abstract": "In general, heterosexual men are less favorable to asking for help compared to women and gay men. This can be problematic if a man avoids professional help when he is experiencing significant psychological distress. Yet, it is unclear to what degree such attitudes among men are due to innate differences or social environments. Studying twins provides one avenue for teasing apart these relationships.\nWe recruited 38 pairs of monozygotic male twins (Mage = 35.87 years, SD = 9.52) raised together and who were discordant for sexual orientation. They completed measures of psychological distress (Symptom Checklist-90-Revised), positive attitudes toward psychological help-seeking behavior, and emphasis with fulfilling traditional masculine norms.\nContrary to predictions, the heterosexual twins expressed more symptoms of specific distress-hostility (r = .30), paranoid ideation (r = .26), and psychoticism (r = .24)-than their gay cotwins. As predicted, heterosexual men were less favorable to seeking help (r = .25) and expressed greater emphasis on masculine norms (r = .26) than their cotwins. Within each group of men, unique aspects of masculine norms were significantly related to attitudes toward psychological help-seeking behavior.\nThe findings lend credence to the hypothesis that social environments influence attitudes and behaviors that are stereotypically masculine and potentially detrimental to men's health.",

    "abstract": "Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is the 4th most common malignancy in men and the 8th most common cause of male cancer death in the United States. Conversely, upper tract urothelial carcinoma accounts for only 5% to 10% of all urothelial carcinoma. Due to the relative preponderance of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, much of the clinical decision making regarding upper tract urothelial carcinoma is extrapolated from evidence that is based on urothelial carcinoma of the bladder cohorts. In fact, only 1 major urological organization has treatment guidelines specific for upper tract urothelial carcinoma. While significant similarities exist between these 2 diseases, ignoring the important differences may be preventing us from optimizing therapy in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Therefore, we explored these dissimilarities, including the differential importance of gender, anatomy, staging, intracavitary therapy, surgical lymphadenectomy and perioperative systemic chemotherapy on the behavior of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and upper tract urothelial carcinoma.\nA nonsystematic literature search using the MEDLINE/PubMed\u00ae database was conducted to identify original articles, review articles and editorials. Searches were limited to the English language and studies in humans and in adults, and used the key words urothelial carcinoma, upper tract urothelial carcinoma or transitional cell carcinoma combined with several different sets of key words to identify appropriate publications for each section of the manuscript. The key words, broken down by section, were 1) epidemiology, sex, gender; 2) location, tumor location; 3) staging, stage; 4) intracavitary, intravesical, topical therapy; 5) lymphadenectomy, lymph node, lymph node dissection and 6) adjuvant, neoadjuvant, chemotherapy.\nWomen who present with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder do so with less favorable tumor characteristics and have worse survival than men. However, gender does not appear to be associated with survival outcomes in upper tract urothelial carcinoma. The prognostic effect that urothelial carcinoma tumor location has on outcomes prediction is a matter of debate, and the influence of tumor location may reflect our technical ability to accurately stage and treat the disease more than the actual tumor biology. Moreover, technical limitations of upper tract urothelial carcinoma sampling compared to transurethral resection for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder are the most important source of staging differences between the 2 diseases. Intravesical chemotherapy and immunotherapy are essential components of standard of care for most nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, while adjuvant intracavitary therapy for patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma treated endoscopically or percutaneously has been sparsely used and without any clear guidelines. The widespread adoption of the use of intracavitary therapy in the upper tract will likely not only require additional data to support its efficacy, but will also require a less cumbersome means of administration. Lymphadenectomy at the time of radical cystectomy is widely accepted while lymphadenectomy at the time of radical nephroureterectomy is performed largely at the discretion of the surgeon. Among other reasons, this may be due in part to the variable lymphatic drainage along the course of the ureter compared to the relatively confined lymphatic landing sites for the bladder. Level I evidence has demonstrated a clear survival benefit for systemic chemotherapy before radical surgery or radiation in patients with clinical T2-4N0M0 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Such data are not available in the population with upper tract urothelial carcinoma. However, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be even more important in upper tract urothelial carcinoma than in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder because of the obligatory kidney function loss that occurs at radical nephroureterectomy.\nWhile urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and upper tract urothelial carcinoma share many characteristics, they represent 2 distinct diseases. There are practical, anatomical, biological and molecular differences that warrant consideration when risk stratifying and treating patients with these disparate twin diseases. To overcome the challenges that impede progress toward evidence-based medicine in upper tract urothelial carcinoma, we believe that focused collaborative efforts will best augment our understanding of this rare disease and ultimately improve the care we deliver to our patients.",

    "results": "Women who present with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder do so with less favorable tumor characteristics and have worse survival than men. However, gender does not appear to be associated with survival outcomes in upper tract urothelial carcinoma. The prognostic effect that urothelial carcinoma tumor location has on outcomes prediction is a matter of debate, and the influence of tumor location may reflect our technical ability to accurately stage and treat the disease more than the actual tumor biology. Moreover, technical limitations of upper tract urothelial carcinoma sampling compared to transurethral resection for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder are the most important source of staging differences between the 2 diseases. Intravesical chemotherapy and immunotherapy are essential components of standard of care for most nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, while adjuvant intracavitary therapy for patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma treated endoscopically or percutaneously has been sparsely used and without any clear guidelines. The widespread adoption of the use of intracavitary therapy in the upper tract will likely not only require additional data to support its efficacy, but will also require a less cumbersome means of administration. Lymphadenectomy at the time of radical cystectomy is widely accepted while lymphadenectomy at the time of radical nephroureterectomy is performed largely at the discretion of the surgeon. Among other reasons, this may be due in part to the variable lymphatic drainage along the course of the ureter compared to the relatively confined lymphatic landing sites for the bladder. Level I evidence has demonstrated a clear survival benefit for systemic chemotherapy before radical surgery or radiation in patients with clinical T2-4N0M0 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Such data are not available in the population with upper tract urothelial carcinoma. However, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be even more important in upper tract urothelial carcinoma than in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder because of the obligatory kidney function loss that occurs at radical nephroureterectomy.",

    "abstract": "With the desire to assess genetic variation across the lifespan in large-scale collaborative projects, one question is whether inference of copy number (CN) is sensitive to the source of material for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis (e.g., blood and buccal) and another question is whether CN is stable as individual sage. Here, we address these questions by applying Affymetrix 6.0 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)micro-arrays to 1,472 DNA samples from 710 individuals from the Netherlands Twin Register, including twin and non-twin individuals (372 with buccal and blood derived DNA and 388 with longitudinal data).Similar concordance for CN and genotype inference between samples from the same individual [or from the monozygotic (MZ) co-twins] was found for blood and buccal tissues. There was a small but statistically significant decrease in across-tissue concordance compared with concordance of samples from the same tissue type. No temporal effect was seen on CN variation from the 388 individuals sampled at two time points ranging from 1 to 12 years apart. The majority of our individuals were sampled at age younger than 20 years. Genotype concordance was very high (~ > 99%) between co-twins from 43 MZ pairs. For75 dizygotic (DZ) pairs, ~was ~65%. CN estimates were highly consistent between co-twins from MZ pairs for both deletions (f?2 ~ 90%) and duplications (~ ~ 86%). For DZ, these were similar for within-individual comparisons, but naturally lower between co-twins (~ ~ 50-60%). These results suggest that DNA from buccal samples perform as well as DNA from blood samples on the current generation of micro-array technologies.",

    "abstract": "The dramatic increase in multiple births is an important public health issue, since such births have elevated risks for adverse perinatal outcomes. Our objective was to explore the most recent temporal trends in rates of multiple births in Canada and the United States.\nLive birth data from Canada (excluding Ontario) and the United States from 1991-2009 were used to calculate rates of twins, and triplet and higher-order multiples (triplet+). Temporal trends were assessed using tests for linear trend and absolute and relative changes in rates.\nTwin live births in the United States increased from 23.1 in 1991 to 32.2 per 1,000 live births in 2004, remained stable between 2004 and 2007, and then increased slightly to an all-time high of 33.2 per 1,000 live births in 2009. In Canada, rates also increased from 20.0 in 1991 to 28.3 per 1,000 live births in 2004, continued to increase modestly between 2004 and 2007, and rose to a high of 31.4 per 1,000 in 2009. Rates of triplet+ live births in the United States increased dramatically from 81.4 in 1991 to 193.5 per 100,000 live births in 1998, remained stable between 1998 and 2003 and then decreased to 148.9 per 100,000 in 2007. The rate declined marginally in 2008, but then rose again in 2009 to 153.5 per 100,000. Rates of triplet+ live births were much lower in Canada, although the temporal pattern of change was similar.\nThe rate of twin live births in the United States and Canada continues to increase, though more modestly than during the 1990s. Recent declines in rates of triplet+ live births in both countries have been followed by unstable trends.",

    "abstract": "Scientific literature is limited on problems related to the psychotherapy of twins, especially eating disorders. This paper discusses the therapeutic difficulties encountered with two anorexic and one bulimic sets of twins.\nThe three case reports show that the symbiotic tendency of twins is a frequent phenomenon, which may be a special resistance against change, and can serve as a factor maintaining the pathological state. In many cases, the parental behaviour strengthens the symbiosis of the twins, instead of helping the individuation.\nThe integration of individual and family therapeutic interventions is proposed. The separation-individuation process of the twins can be stimulated by individual sessions with each of the twins, or separate sessions during family therapy (i.e., sessions with the parents and with one of the twins). In this case, the best strategy would be to have the individual and family therapies conducted by the same therapist.",

    "abstract": "We describe how the use of multiple drugs and excessive alcohol intake caused a dilated cardiomyopathy complicated by cardiogenic shock and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in an otherwise healthy young man. The diagnosis was made by exclusion of other causes of cardiomyopathy. Surprisingly an ischaemic scar without significant coronary artery disease was also found on cardiac MRI, most likely related to vasoactive drugs (cocaine). An ICD was implanted during the same hospital stay after careful assessment of the risk of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the association of mild symptoms and mental well-being with risk of disability pension (DP) due to somatic diagnoses, even less for DP due to low back diagnoses (LBD). Moderate genetic influences on personality traits, life dissatisfaction and DP exist suggesting that shared genetic influences may underlie these associations. One can control for familial confounding (genetics and family environment) by examining twins. This twin study aimed to investigate personality traits and life dissatisfaction as predictors for DP due to LBD accounting for familial confounding.\nData on 24043 twins aged 18-65year in a baseline survey in 1975 was followed up from national DP register data until 2004. Personality traits were assessed using the short version of the Eysenck Personality Inventory and life dissatisfaction was measured with a four item scale on levels of interest, happiness, easiness, and loneliness of life. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nDP due to LBD was granted to 537 individuals during the follow-up. Each one unit increase in life dissatisfaction (HR 1.06; 95%CI 1.03, 1.10) and neuroticism (1.07; 1.03, 1.10) but not extroversion was significantly associated with an elevated risk for DP due to LBD. These associations with life dissatisfaction and neuroticism remained when socioeconomic status, education, and marital status were taken into account, and demonstrated an independence from familial confounding.\nLife dissatisfaction and neuroticism seems to be early, perhaps causal risk factors for DP due to LBD.",

    "abstract": "We explored genetic influences on the perception of taste and smell stimuli. Adult twins rated the chemosensory aspects of water, sucrose, sodium chloride, citric acid, ethanol, quinine hydrochloride, phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), potassium chloride, calcium chloride, cinnamon, androstenone, Galaxolide\u2122, cilantro, and basil. For most traits, individual differences were stable over time and some traits were heritable (h(2) from 0.41 to 0.71). Subjects were genotyped for 44 single nucleotide polymorphisms within and near genes related to taste and smell. The results of these association analyses confirmed previous genotype-phenotype results for PTC, quinine, and androstenone. New associations were detected for ratings of basil and a bitter taste receptor gene, TAS2R60, and between cilantro and variants in three genes (TRPA1, GNAT3, and TAS2R50). The flavor of ethanol was related to variation within an olfactory receptor gene (OR7D4) and a gene encoding a subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (SCNN1D). Our study demonstrates that person-to-person differences in the taste and smell perception of simple foods and drinks are partially accounted for by genetic variation within chemosensory pathways.",

    "abstract": "A difference more than 15-40% in birth weight of twins can predict perinatal complications. As significant difference in twins growth has a very important effect on pregnancy and perinatal complications, this study aimed to evaluate crown-rump length discordance (\u0394CRL) in the first trimester of pregnancy and its correlation with perinatal complications.\nA total number of 118 women in the first trimester of twin pregnancy underwent ultrasound examination to measure \u0394CRL. Then, at the time of delivery, perinatal complications in twins were recorded and the correlation between \u0394CRL and perinatal complications were evaluated.\nAmong 118 studied mothers with twin pregnancy, \u0394CRL was normal (< 11%) in 96 cases (81.4%) and high (\u2265 11%) in 22 cases (18.6%). Birth weight discordance was normal (< 20%) in 103 cases (87.3%) and above normal (\u2265 20%) in 15 cases (12.7%). The results revealed a significant correlation between higher frequency of small for gestational age (SGA) and high \u0394CRL (more than 11%) (p = 0.01).\nOur study concluded that SGA has a significant relationship with high \u0394CRL (> 11%).",

    "abstract": "The clinical features of loss of ARHGAP4 function remain unclear despite several reports of different patterns of deletions inactivating different functional regions of the protein. The protein encoded by ARHGAP4 is thought to function as a Rho GTPase activating protein. Characterization of the genetic defect causing X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) and intellectual disability in two dizygotic twin brothers revealed a novel contiguous deletion of 17,905\u2009bp encompassing the entire AVPR2 gene and extending into intron 7 of the ARHGAP4 gene. Examination of their mother showed that she was a carrier of this deletion. An attempt was made to distinguish the putative clinical signs of an ARHGAP4 deletion from the well-defined phenotype of X-linked NDI caused by an AVPR2 gene deletion. By reviewing all characterized deletions encompassing ARHGAP4, we reconsider the potential role of ARHGAP4 in cognition.",

    "abstract": "Low birthweight (BW) is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. We compared glucose metabolism in adult BW-discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins, thereby controlling for genetic factors and rearing environment.\nAmong 77,885 twins in the Danish Twin Registry, 155 of the most BW-discordant MZ twin pairs (median BW difference 0.5\u00a0kg) were assessed using a 2\u00a0h oral glucose tolerance test with sampling of plasma (p-)glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1. HOMA for beta cell function (HOMA-\u03b2) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and also insulin sensitivity index (BIGTT-SI) and acute insulin response (BIGTT-AIR), were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed in those with: (1) double verification of BW difference; (2) difference in BW >0.5\u00a0kg; and (3) no overt metabolic disease (type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or thyroid disease).\nNo intra-pair differences in p-glucose, insulin, C-peptide, incretin hormones, HOMA-\u03b2, HOMA-IR or BIGTT-SI were identified. p-Glucose at 120\u00a0min was higher in the twins with the highest BW without metabolic disease, and BIGTT-AIR was higher in those with the highest BW although not in pairs with a BW difference of >0.5\u00a0kg.\nBW-discordant MZ twins provide no evidence for a detrimental effect of low BW on glucose metabolism in adulthood once genetic factors and rearing environment are controlled for.",

Nucleation, growth and crystallization of new nanocrystals, and depletion of parent nanorice was observed by the in situ TEM through electron-beam irradiation. It can be seen that the fundamental growth mechanism of the new nucleus is Ag atom diffusion or migration through carbon film supported these crystals. Twins in the as-grown nanorice is a reflection twin with {111} lattice plane as the common plane, and they are formed by 120\u00b0 or 60\u00b0 rotation about the reference twin lamella. Shockley partial dislocation was formed by the {111} lattice plane shifting along the <112> direction with the Burgers vector a/6 <112>. Twin faults occur in the form of adjacent twin lamellas inserted into a single atomic plane. Growth morphology analysis suggests that {111} and {001} lattice planes with the minimum surface attachment energy have a tendency to facet.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the link between sibling relationships and children's social adjustment by comparing twin siblings and siblings with different ages (singleton siblings}, and clarified the role of reciprocity in sibling relationships on children's social development. Mothers of 58 monozygotic twin pairs, 48 dizygotic twin pairs, and 86 singleton sibling pairs reported their children's sibling relationships and social adjustment.This study showed that the effects of sibling relationships on the prosocial behaviors and conduct problems of each child are stronger for twins than for singleton siblings. Moreover, positivity toward one's sibling increased peer problems only among monozygotic twins. The opposite tendency was present among dizygotic twins and singleton siblings. This study suggests the importance for children's social development of having many interactions with siblings and establishing reciprocity in sibling relationships. Moreover, our results suggest that the quality of sibling relationships among monozygotic twins may be different from those among dizygotic twins and singleton siblings.",

The primary outcome was change from baseline in square root transformed total lapses (response time \u2265 500 ms) per trial. Patient-specific linear rates of performance deficit accumulation were separated from circadian effects using multiple linear regression. Using the classic approach to assess heritability, the intraclass correlation coefficients for accumulating deficits resulted in a broad sense heritability (h(2)) estimate of 0.834. The mean within-pair and among-pair heritability estimates determined by analysis of variance-based methods was 0.715. When variance components of mixed-effect multilevel models were estimated by maximum likelihood estimation and used to determine the proportions of phenotypic variance explained by genetic and nongenetic factors, 51.1% (standard error = 8.4%, P < 0.0001) of twin variance was attributed to combined additive and dominance genetic effects.\nGenetic factors explain a large fraction of interindividual variance among rates of performance deficit accumulations on PVT during sleep deprivation.",

    "abstract": "Appearance, aging, and disorders of the breast are multifactorial. There are intrinsic, patient-specific characteristics, such as breast growth during puberty and propensity for breast cancer, which are primarily inherited. There are also environmental factors, which can be potentially controlled. Monozygotic twins provide an excellent research opportunity to examine the role of extrinsic factors in subjects with identical genetic predispositions.\nThe authors investigate the role and significance of various environmental and acquired factors on breast aesthetics.\nIdentical female twins were recruited during the Twins Days Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, in 2009 and 2010. After consent was obtained, enrolled subjects completed a comprehensive survey on their medical and personal history. Standardized digital photographs were taken by medical photographers. Sixteen aesthetic breast features were subjectively rated by 6 plastic surgery residents blinded to the survey results. These ratings were then analyzed against survey data to determine the significance of different exogenous factors on breast appearance.\nA total of 161 pairs of identical female twins (n = 322) with a mean (SD) age of 47.6 (14.5) years were recruited. Twins who moisturized their skin daily had significantly fewer rhytids (P = .002). Twins who received hormone replacement therapy after menopause had more attractive breast shape, size, projection, areolar shape, and areolar size (P < .03). However, twins who had a higher body mass index, greater number of pregnancies, and larger cup sizes had significantly less attractive breasts (P < .05). Twins who smoked cigarettes and consumed alcohol also had significantly less attractive breasts (P < .05). Twins who breastfed had less attractive areolar size and shape but better skin quality than their counterparts who never breastfed (P < .03). Finally, there was a significantly higher incidence of breast pain in twins who primarily slept on their sides compared with twins who primarily slept on their backs (P < .008).\nThis study implicates several environmental factors that significantly affect the aesthetic quality of breasts.",

    "abstract": "Sequence-based variation in gene expression is a key driver of disease risk. Common variants regulating expression in cis have been mapped in many expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, typically in single tissues from unrelated individuals. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of gene expression across multiple tissues conducted in a large set of mono- and dizygotic twins that allows systematic dissection of genetic (cis and trans) and non-genetic effects on gene expression. Using identity-by-descent estimates, we show that at least 40% of the total heritable cis effect on expression cannot be accounted for by common cis variants, a finding that reveals the contribution of low-frequency and rare regulatory variants with respect to both transcriptional regulation and complex trait susceptibility. We show that a substantial proportion of gene expression heritability is trans to the structural gene, and we identify several replicating trans variants that act predominantly in a tissue-restricted manner and may regulate the transcription of many genes.",

    "abstract": "Risk factors related to obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) are known for singleton deliveries. No study to date has described the rate and risk factors involved in twin deliveries.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study (1985-2010) of all vaginal twin and singleton deliveries in a single tertiary center. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for OASIS at delivery was estimated using the logistic regression model.\nThe study comprised 1,538 and 91,312 patients with vaginal twin and singleton delivery, respectively. Twenty twin (1.27 %) and 2,331 (2.55 %) singleton deliveries were complicated with OASIS. The following OASIS-associated risk factors were shared by both populations: nulliparity [twins adjusted OR 5.9, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.7-20.9; singletons adjusted OR 3.9, 95 % CI 3.5-4.4), occipitoposterior (OP) position (twins adjusted OR 3.00, 95 % CI 1.1-8.0; singletons adjusted OR 1.6, 95 % CI 1.3-2.00), birthweight (for each 100 g) (twin adjusted OR 1.1, 95 % CI 1.0-1.2; singletons adjusted OR 1.07, 95 % CI 1.06-1.08), and instrumental delivery (twins adjusted OR 4.3, 95 % CI 1.2-15.4, singletons adjusted OR 2.4, 95 % CI 2.2-2.6).\nRisk factors of nulliparity, OP position, large fetal size, and instrumental delivery were shared by both twin and singleton deliveries. These data will be useful in counselling women carrying twins who intend to deliver vaginally.",

    "abstract": "Since 2006, the advent of increasingly larger genome-wide association studies and their meta-analyses have led to numerous, replicated findings of genetic polymorphisms associated with many diseases and traits. Early studies suggested that the identified loci generally accounted for a small fraction of the genetic variance estimated from twin and family studies. This led to the concept of 'missing heritability'. Here, the progress in accounting for a greater proportion of the variance is reviewed. In particular, gene-environment interactions can, for some traits and in certain circumstances, explain part of this missing heritability.",

    "abstract": "Hyperthyroidism is associated with severe comorbidity, such as stroke, and seems to confer increased mortality. However, it is unknown whether this increased mortality is explained by hyperthyroidism per se, comorbidity, and/or genetic confounding.\nThe objective of the study was to investigate whether hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased mortality and, if so, whether the association is influenced by comorbidity and/or genetic confounding.\nThis was an observational cohort study using record-linkage data from nationwide Danish health registers. We identified 4850 singletons and 926 twins from same-sex pairs diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Each case was matched with four controls for age and gender. The Charlson score was calculated from discharge diagnoses on an individual level to measure comorbidity. Cases and controls were followed up for a mean of 10 yr (range 0-31 yr), and the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was calculated using Cox regression analyses.\nIn singletons there was a significantly higher mortality in individuals diagnosed with hyperthyroidism than in controls [HR 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-1.46]. This persisted after adjustment for preexisting comorbidity (HR 1,28; 95% CI 1.21-1.36). In twin pairs discordant for hyperthyroidism (625 pairs), the twin with hyperthyroidism had an increased mortality compared with the corresponding cotwin (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.09-1.88). However, this was found only in dizygotic pairs (HR 1.80; 95% CI 1.27-2.55) but not in monozygotic pairs (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.60-1.50).\nHyperthyroidism is associated with an increased mortality independent of preexisting comorbidity. The study of twin pairs discordant for hyperthyroidism suggests that genetic confounding influences the association between hyperthyroidism and mortality.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this case study was to describe pain responses in three study conditions: longer (30 minutes) kangaroo care (KC) before and throughout heel stick (KC30), shorter (15 minutes) KC before and throughout heel stick (KC15), and incubator care throughout heel stick (IC) in 28-week gestational age twins. Pain responses were measured by crying time, Preterm Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), and heart rate variability indexes, including low-frequency power (LF, representing sympathetic activity), high-frequency power (HF, parasympathetic activity), and LF/HF ratio (sympathetic-parasympathetic balance). Both twins cried more and had higher PIPP pain scores and tachycardia during heel stick in the IC condition. Infant B had an incident of apnea and tachycardia by the end of the heel stick and a bradycardia episode during recovery in the IC condition. The twins had lower LF/HF ratios (better autonomic nervous system balance) during recovery in both longer and shorter KC conditions compared with the IC condition. Infant B had difficulty returning to LF/HF ratio baseline level after the painful procedure in the IC condition. These data suggest that both longer and shorter KC before and throughout painful procedures can be helpful in reducing behavioral and physiologic pain responses in preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "Cobedding of preterm twin infants provides tactile, olfactory, and auditory stimulation and may affect pain reactivity. We carried out a randomized trial to assess the effect of cobedding on pain reactivity and recovery in preterm twin neonates.\nStable preterm twins (n = 67 sets) between 28 and 36 weeks of gestational age were randomly assigned to a cobedding group (cared for in the same incubator or crib) or a standard care group (cared for in separate incubators or cribs). Pain response (determined by the Premature Infant Pain Profile [PIPP]) and time to return to physiologic baseline parameters were compared between groups with adjustment for the nonindependence of twin infants.\nMaternal and infant characteristics were not significantly different between twin infants in the cobedding and standard care groups except for 5-minute Apgar <7 and postnatal age and corrected gestational age on the day of the heel lance. Mean PIPP scores were not different between groups at 30, 60, or 120 seconds. At 90 seconds, mean PIPP scores were higher in the cobedding group (6.0 vs 5.0, P = .04). Recovery time was shorter in the cobedding group compared with the standard care group, (mean = 75.6 seconds versus 142.1 seconds, P = .001). No significant adverse events were associated with cobedding. Adjustment for nonindependence between twins and differences in baseline characteristics did not change the results.\nCobedding enhanced the physiologic recovery of preterm twins undergoing heel lance, but did not lead to lower pain scores.",

    "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently persists into adulthood. Family and twin studies delineate a disorder with strong genetic influences among children and adolescents based on parent- and teacher-reported data but little is known about the genetic and environmental contribution to DSM-IV ADHD symptoms in adulthood. We therefore aimed to investigate the impact of genetic and environmental influences on the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms of ADHD in adults.\nTwin methods were applied to self-reported assessments of ADHD symptoms from a large population-based Swedish twin study that included data from 15 198 Swedish male and female twins aged 20 to 46 years.\nThe broad heritability [i.e., A + D, where A is an additive genetic factor and D (dominance) a non-additive genetic factor] was 37% (A = 11%, D = 26%) for inattention and 38% (A = 18%, D = 20%) for hyperactivity-impulsivity. The results also indicate that 52% of the phenotypic correlation between inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity (r = 0.43) was explained by genetic influences whereas the remaining part of the covariance was explained by non-shared environmental influences. These results were replicated across age strata.\nOur findings of moderate broad heritability estimates are consistent with previous literature on self-rated ADHD symptoms in older children, adolescents and adults and retrospective reports of self-rated childhood ADHD by adults but differ from studies of younger children with informant ratings. Future research needs to clarify whether our data indicate a true decrease in the heritability of ADHD in adults compared to children, or whether this relates to the use of self-ratings in contrast to informant data.",

    "abstract": "The study evaluated the applicability of Doppler ultrasonography in predicting the course of pregnancy and neonatal outcome in dichorionic pregnancy complicated by growth discordance.\nDoppler examination of the umbilical artery (UA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) was performed in 106 twins. Abnormal values of the UA pulsatility index (PI) were considered to be above the 95th percentile and below 5th percentile for the MCA PI for gestational week. The difference of UA PI ~0.5 in twin pairs was considered abnormal. Doppler results were compared with selected parameters that characterize the course of pregnancy and fetal outcome.\nAbnormal UA PI as well as the intertwine PI difference of 0.5 and more correlated significantly with lower gestational age at delivery, intertwine growth discordance of 35% or more, lower birth weight, and abnormal fetal outcome. The abnormal cerebra-umbilical(C/U) ratio correlated statistically with lower birth weight, abnormal fetal outcome, and an increased risk of premature delivery. There were no statistically significant differences in the majority of parameters that characterize the neonatal outcome between the groups with normal and abnormal MCA Pl.\nThe intertwine UA PI difference ~0.5 had the highest predictive value in the assessment of adverse fetal outcome and risk for small for gestational age (SGA).

    "abstract": "To investigate the intrauterine growth characteristics of twins and birthweight discordant twins (discordant twins).\nTotal of 1010 twin pregnancies (2020 fetuses) with complete delivery records from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the First and Third Affiliated Hospital of SUN Yat-sen University between January 1, 2000 and July 31, 2010 were studied retrospectively. One handred and ninteen cases (238 fetuses) with intrapair birthweight difference \u2265 25% were determined as the discordant twins group, and the other 891 cases (1782 fetuses) with intrapair birthweight difference < 25% were identified as the concordant twins group. The singleton control group included 4042 singleton pregnancies in the same period.\n(1) Comparison of clinical data between the twins groups: the birthweight of larger-twin, smaller-twin and intrapair birthweight difference in the discordant twins group and the concordant twins group were (2090 \u00b1 827) g, (1392 \u00b1 592) g, (33.9 \u00b1 9.3)%, and (2408 \u00b1 543) g, (2191 \u00b1 505) g, (8.9 \u00b1 6.5)%, respectively, with significant differences (P < 0.01). The incidence of discordant twins was 11.78% (119/1010). Compared with the concordant twins group, the discordant twins group had higher proportion of monochorionic twins, and higher prevalence of pregnancy complications such as late miscarriage, abnormal umbilical insertion, twin-twin transfusion syndrome and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (P < 0.05). (2) The characteristics of twin birthweight distribution: 1) In all the 2020 twins, 80.05% (1617/2020) fetuses had birthweight below the 50(th) percentile of the singleton control group, while 23.71% (479/2020) feeuses got birthweight below the 10(th) percentile of the singleton control group. 2) After 19(th) gestational week, the 50(th) and 90(th) percentile of all twins' birthweight were lower than those of singletons. After 38(th) gestational week, the birthweight of singletons kept increasing and reached its peak at 41(th) week, while the birthweight of twins reached its peak at 38(th) week, followed by a decline at 39 weeks, which was even lower than the 10(th) percentile of the singleton control group. 3) The distribution of birthweight of larger- and smaller-twin in the discordant twins group: 65 (54.6%, 65/119) larger-twins and one (0.8%, 1/119) smaller-twin had birthweight above the 50(th) percentile of all twins, while 5 (4.2%, 5/119) larger-twins and 97 (81.5%, 97/119) smaller-twins got birthweight below the 10(th) percentile of all twins.\n(1) The patterns of birthweight curves for each gestational week are different between twins and singletons. In order to evaluate the growth of twins, birthweight reference for twins should be employed. (2) According to the reference of twins birthweight, the most discordant twins are complicated with fetal growth restriction at least in one twin.",

The incidence of discordant twins was 11.78% (119/1010). Compared with the concordant twins group, the discordant twins group had higher proportion of monochorionic twins, and higher prevalence of pregnancy complications such as late miscarriage, abnormal umbilical insertion, twin-twin transfusion syndrome and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (P < 0.05). (2) The characteristics of twin birthweight distribution: 1) In all the 2020 twins, 80.05% (1617/2020) fetuses had birthweight below the 50(th) percentile of the singleton control group, while 23.71% (479/2020) feeuses got birthweight below the 10(th) percentile of the singleton control group. 2) After 19(th) gestational week, the 50(th) and 90(th) percentile of all twins' birthweight were lower than those of singletons. After 38(th) gestational week, the birthweight of singletons kept increasing and reached its peak at 41(th) week, while the birthweight of twins reached its peak at 38(th) week, followed by a decline at 39 weeks, which was even lower than the 10(th) percentile of the singleton control group. 3) The distribution of birthweight of larger- and smaller-twin in the discordant twins group: 65 (54.6%, 65/119) larger-twins and one (0.8%, 1/119) smaller-twin had birthweight above the 50(th) percentile of all twins, while 5 (4.2%, 5/119) larger-twins and 97 (81.5%, 97/119) smaller-twins got birthweight below the 10(th) percentile of all twins.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the impact of space (geography/ancestry) and time (age of the individuals) on DNA methylation variability in humans. We investigated DNA methylation of the imprinted IGF2/H19 locus in: i) a cohort of individuals homogeneous for age and gender (males with restricted age range: 30-50 years) belonging to four Italian districts representative of the major genetic clines, informative for the geographical dimension; ii) a cohort of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins of different ages (age-range: 22-97 years), informative for the temporal dimension. DNA methylation of the analyzed regions displayed high levels of inter-individual variability that could not be ascribed to any geographical cline. In MZ twins we identified two IGF2/H19 regions where the intra-couple variations significantly increased after the age of 60 years. The analysis of twins' individual life histories suggests that the within twin pairs difference is likely the result of the aging process itself, as sharing a common environment for long periods had no effect on DNA methylation divergence. On the whole, the data here reported suggest that: i) aging more than population genetics is responsible for the inter-individual variability in DNA methylation patterns in humans; ii) DNA methylation variability appears to be highly region-specific.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the authors investigated the potential contribution of environmental factors and testosterone levels on androgenic alopecia in women.\nNinety-eight identical female twins were recruited from 2009 to 2011. Subjects were asked to complete a comprehensive questionnaire, provide a sputum sample for testosterone analysis, and pose for standardized digital photography. Frontal, temporal, and vertex hair loss were assessed from the photographs using Adobe Photoshop. Hair loss measures were then correlated with survey responses and testosterone levels between twin pairs. Two independent, blinded observers also rated the photographs for hair thinning.\nFactors associated with increased frontal hair loss included multiple marriages (p = 0.043); longer sleep duration (p = 0.011); higher severity of stress (p = 0.034); positive smoking history (p = 0.021); higher income (p = 0.023); absence of hat use (p = 0.017); and history of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.023), polycystic ovarian syndrome (p = 0.002), and hypertension (p = 0.001). Factors associated with increased temporal hair loss included divorce or separation (p = 0.034), multiple marriages (p = 0.040), more children (p = 0.005), longer sleep duration (p = 0.006), and history of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.008) and hypertension (p = 0.027). Lack of sun protection (p = 0.020), consuming less caffeine (p = 0.040), history of skin disease (p = 0.048), and lack of exercise (p = 0.012) were associated with increased vertex hair loss. Higher testosterone levels were associated with increased temporal and vertex hair loss patterns (p < 0.039). Increased stress, increased smoking, having more children, and having a history of hypertension and cancer were all associated with increased hair thinning (p < 0.05).\nThis study implicates several environmental risk factors in the pathophysiology of female alopecia.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to evaluate the degree of placenta share discordance in relation to the betamethasone-induced return of positive end-diastolic flow in monochorionic twin pregnancies with selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) and abnormal umbilical artery Doppler. Monochorionic twins with sIUGR was defined as one twin having an estimated fetal weight below the 10th percentile combined with an estimated fetal weight discordance >25%. The umbilical artery Doppler directly prior to (D0) and 24 hours (D1) and 48 hours (D2) after the first dose of betamethasone administration was recorded. The estimated individual placental weight in monochorionic twins was obtained by cutting the placenta along the vascular equator into two territories; the placenta share discordance was calculated as [(estimated individual placental weight of appropriated for gestational age twin- estimated individual placental weight of growth restricted twin)/estimated individual placental weight of appropriated for gestational age twin] \u00d7 100%. Six (23.1%) of the 26 included cases achieved betamethasone-induced return of positive umbilical artery end-diastolic flow. The difference of placenta share discordance and birth weight discordance were not significantly different between twins with and without betamethasone-induced return of positive umbilical artery end-diastolic flow. Thus, according to our study results, it was proposed that although the placenta share discordance correlated with the abnormal umbilical artery Doppler in the IUGR fetus in monochorionic twin, the betamethasone-induced return of positive umbilical artery end-diastolic flow, however, did not reveal the similar relationship with the severity of placenta share discordance.",

    "abstract": "We report a rare case of monozygotic (MZ) twins who developed simultaneous onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Laboratory finding showed similar values of blood sugar, pH, glycosylated hemoglobin, and C-peptide. Urinary sugar and ketones were detected in both. Endocrine and immunological assessment showed similar results. No evidence (clinical or serological) of recent viral or bacterial infection was found. In the 4 years of follow-up, the twins also showed a similar course of disease. Concordance rates for T1DM are high in MZ twins; nevertheless, a simultaneous onset and a similar course of disease are unusual, as well as the HLA allelic variants of our patients. This extraordinary concordance in a pair of MZ twins could be the consequence of a greater environmental similarity or the role of genetic factors other than HLA genes in our twins.",

    "abstract": "Nasal carriage is a major risk factor for Staphylococcus aureus infection. Approximately, one-quarter of adults carry S. aureus. However, the role of host genetics on S. aureus nasal carriage is unknown.\nNasal swabs were obtained from a national cohort of middle-aged and elderly Danish twins. Subjects colonized with S. aureus were identified by growth on selective plates and spa typing. A second sample was obtained from twins initially concordant for carriage. Twins found to again be colonized with S. aureus were defined as persistent carriers.\nThe prevalence of S. aureus carriage among 617 twin pairs (monozygotic/dizygotic pairs: 112/505) was 26.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.0%-28.9%). The concordance rate for carriage did not differ significantly between pairs of monozygotic (37.5%; 95% CI, 22.3%-53.8%) twins and same sex (24.2%; 95% CI, 15.4%-34.5%), and opposite sex (21.4%; 95% CI, 12.0%-33.4%) dizygotic twins. Despite shared childhoods, only 1 of 617 pairs was concordant with respect to lineage. Although heritability increased for S. aureus and lineage persistency, no significant heritability was detected.\nIn this study, host genetic factors exhibited only a modest influence on the S. aureus carrier state of middle-aged and elderly individuals.",

    "abstract": "Scleroderma (SSc) is a rare connective tissue disease characterized by fibrosis, microvasculopathy and autoimmune features. The role of genetics is limited in SSc, as suggested by similar concordance rates in monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, while environmental factors may act through epigenetic changes, as demonstrated for specific genes. Further, sex chromosome changes have been reported in SSc and may explain the female preponderance. In the present study we compared the methylation profile of all X chromosome genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from monozygotic twins discordant (n=7) and concordant (n=1) for SSc. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitations from each discordant twin pair were hybridized to a custom-designed array included 998 sites encompassing promoters of all X chromosome genes and randomly chosen autosomal genes. Biostatistical tools identified sites with an elevated probability to be consistently hypermethylated (n=18) or hypomethylated (n=25) in affected twins. Identified genes include transcription factors (ARX, HSFX1, ZBED1, ZNF41) and surface antigens (IL1RAPL2, PGRMC1), and pathway analysis suggests their involvement in cell proliferation (PGK1, SMS, UTP14A, SSR4), apoptosis (MTM1), inflammation (ARAF) and oxidative stress (ENOX2). In conclusion, we propose that X chromosome genes with different methylation profiles in monozygotic twin pairs may constitute candidates for SSc susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "One of the core behavioral features associated with obsessive compulsive symptomatology is the inability to inhibit thoughts and/or behaviors. Neuroimaging studies have indicated abnormalities in frontostriatal and dorsolateral prefrontal - anterior cingulate circuits during inhibitory control in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder compared with controls. In the present study, task performance and brain activation during Stroop color-word and Flanker interference were compared within monozygotic twin pairs discordant for obsessive compulsive symptoms and between groups of pairs scoring very low or very high on obsessive compulsive symptoms, in order to examine the differential impact of non-shared environmental versus genetic risk factors for obsessive compulsive symptomatology on inhibitory control related functional brain activation. Although performance was intact, brain activation during inhibition of distracting information differed between obsessive compulsive symptom high-scoring compared to low-scoring subjects. Regions affected in the discordant group (e.g., temporal and anterior cingulate gyrus) were partly different from those observed to be affected in the concordant groups (e.g., parietal gyrus and thalamus). A robust increase in dorsolateral prefrontal activity during response interference was observed in both the high-scoring twins of the discordant sample and the high-scoring twins of the concordant sample, marking this structure as a possible key region for disturbances in inhibitory control in obsessive compulsive disorder.",

    "abstract": "The development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is under strong genetic control and there is great interest in the genetic variants that confer increased risk. The Alzheimer's disease risk gene, growth factor receptor bound protein 2-associated protein (GAB2), has been shown to provide a 1.27-1.51 increased odds of developing LOAD for rs7101429 major allele carriers, in case-control analysis. GAB2 is expressed across the brain throughout life, and its role in LOAD pathology is well understood. Recent studies have begun to examine the effect of genetic variation in the GAB2 gene on differences in the brain. However, the effect of GAB2 on the young adult brain has yet to be considered. Here we found a significant association between the GAB2 gene and morphological brain differences in 755 young adult twins (469 females) (M = 23.1, SD = 3.1 years), using a gene-based test with principal components regression (PCReg). Detectable differences in brain morphology are therefore associated with variation in the GAB2 gene, even in young adults, long before the typical age of onset of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Fetal growth restriction in singletons has been shown to enhance fetal lung maturation and reduce the risk of respiratory distress syndrome due to increased endogenous steroid production. However, data on lung maturation in growth-discordant monochorionic (thus, identical) twins are lacking. Our objective was to compare the risk of severe neonatal morbidity between the larger and the smaller twin in monochorionic twins with birth weight discordance (BWD). We included in the study all consecutive monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies with severe BWD (\u226525%) and two live-born twins delivered at our center (n=47 twin pairs). We compared the incidence of neonatal morbidity, particularly respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and cerebral lesions between the larger and the smaller co-twin. The incidence of severe neonatal morbidity in the larger and smaller twin was 38% (18/47) and 19% (9/47), respectively (odds ratio (OR) 2.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-7.44) and was due primarily to the higher incidence of RDS, 32% (15/47) and 6% (3/47), respectively (OR 6.88, 95% CI 1.66-32.83). In conclusion, this study shows that the larger twin in monochorionic twin pairs with BWD is at increased risk of severe neonatal morbidity, particularly RDS, compared to the smaller twin.",

    "abstract": "The increasing rates of preterm birth among twins implicate that solid data on associated risks and outcomes are required. Assessment of zygosity is often based on clinical criteria (evaluation of placenta; same gender, birth weight discordance as surrogate criteria for monochorionic/monozygotic twins). The aim of this study was to compare clinical versus genetic assessment of zygosity and to compare causes of preterm delivery as well as outcome data of very-low-birth-weight (VLBW; birth weight <1,500 g) twins stratified to zygosity. In a multicenter study, we selected n=176 sets of same gender twins and determined zygosity genetically. In a subgroup of 123 sets of twins, the attending physicians at the study centers were asked to document the parameter 'zygosity' (monozygotic/dizygotic) on the basis of their clinical judgment. Concordance between genetic and clinical assessment was 62.7% for monozygotic twins and 88.9% for dizygotic twins, respectively. Outcome parameters (death, BPD, ROP, NEC, IVH) were comparable in both groups. Genetically dizygotic twins were significantly more often born due to intrauterine infection (33% vs. 20% in monozygotic twins, p<.01) and antenatal antibiotics were more frequently given to mothers of dizygotic twins (62% vs. 47% in monozygotic twins, p<.01). Obstetric complications such as twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome were only seen in monozygotic twins as expected. The unexpected increase of antenatal antibiotic treatment and birth due to intrauterine infection in dizygotic twins should be confirmed in additional VLBW twin-cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Though multiple policies have been implemented, the cigarette control in China is still facing a great challenge. At the same time, alcohol drinking has increasingly become a public health problem. Considering cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking often co-occur, a few studies tested the covariance of these phenotypes. However, the genetic and environmental correlation between them among Chinese population has not been determined. The main aim of this study is to fill this gap.\nFrom the Chinese National Twin Registry, we obtained the data on cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking behaviors. The ordinal bivariate genetic analysis was performed to fit the categorical variables. After identifying the best decomposition among the Cholesky, common, and independent pathway model, we established the most parsimonious submodel.\nThe correlation between current tobacco and alcohol use could be explained by Cholesky model. The shared environmental variances for both phenotypes were dropped to construct the most parsimonious submodel. Furthermore, the most parsimonious submodel showed a moderate correlation (0.32, 95%CI=0.17-0.46) between the genetic components and a negligible non-shared environmental correlation.\nAs the first bivariate genetic analysis on current tobacco smoking and current alcohol drinking in China, this study suggested a common genetic vulnerability to tobacco and alcohol use in male twins. Further studies should be carried out to track the pertinent genes that are related to the comorbidity of smoking and drinking in Chinese population. Another urgent need is to recognize the behavior-specific environmental risk factors.",

The first three stages involved performing gradual circumferential craniotomies, dividing the dura, ligating large and small bridging veins, separating abutting brains, and inserting skin expanders. The fourth stage involved dividing the remaining dura and veins, transecting shared brain tissue not detected in preoperative imaging, replacing dura in twin B, and replacing skin over native dura in twin A. Planning and carrying out separation of the conjoined twins required organization and cooperation of all the disciplines involved to prepare the children preoperatively, care for them perioperatively and postoperatively, and support the mother during the process.",

    "abstract": "The association of FTO gene variants with body mass index (BMI) and other obesity characteristics is well established. However, uncertainties remain whether the association is present only in young populations and whether it is attributable to body fat mass specifically. We aimed to clarify these two questions in a large sample (N= 4,523 individuals) of middle-aged and older (range 40-80 years) British female twins. The women were assessed for BMI, waist and hip circumference, total lean (LBM) and fat (FBM) body mass. Since the majority of FTO association signals have been reported in a haploblock bordering 52,355-52,408 kb (on chromosome 16q12.2), we examined five genotyped and 43 imputed SNPs mapped to this block. Canonical correlation and other association analyses showed significant and consistent association between the selected SNP and studied body composition phenotypes, with p-values reaching p= 0.000004. Of particular interest, in addition to the expected significant associations between FTO variants and FBM, we also identified significant associations with LBM. These results suggest that the association between FTO variants and body composition phenotypes is present across a wide range of ages, and that FTO appears primarily to affect the amount of body soft tissue, influencing both fat and lean mass.",

    "abstract": "Increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) plasma levels have been described to occur during physical exercise. A relative reduction in energy intake after physical activity has also been reported after exercise, indicating a possible involvement of IL-6 as an anorexigenic factor. Given the possible effect of interleukins on appetite, we assessed whether a controlled physical activity bout is related with changes in IL-6, IL-6 soluble receptor (IL-6sR), gp130 and interleukin-18 (IL-18) plasma levels, as well as their relation with post-exercise energy intake. A co-twin intervention study was carried out with five young male monozygotic twin pairs. One co-twin performed 45\u00a0min of submaximal exercise on a treadmill near the anaerobic threshold ending with 7\u00a0min at 90\u00a0% VO(2) max, while his co-twin remained non-active. Ad libitum energy intake was tested through a carbohydrate-rich meal test. Venous blood samples were drawn at baseline, immediately after exercise and after the meal ingestion. Plasma concentrations of IL-6, IL-6sR, gp130 and IL-18 were measured via ELISA. IL-6 plasma levels increased after physical activity bout (2.6-fold change; p\u2009=\u20090.04). A less marked trend, although still significant, was observed for plasma levels of IL-6sR and gp130. Plasma levels of IL-18 did not significantly change during exercise. The twins who exercised exhibited significantly lower energy intake (181 versus 1,195\u00a0kcal; p\u2009=\u20090.04), compared to the co-twins who remained resting. The present study in monozygotic twins shows increased IL-6 plasma levels after acute physical exercise with a significant reduction in energy intake, supporting a linkage between IL-6 and acute post-exercise eating behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Researchers have long been interested in the influence of family size on children's educational outcomes. Simply put, theories have suggested that resources are diluted within families that have more children. Although the empirical literature on developed countries has generally confirmed the theoretical prediction that family size is negatively related to children's education, studies focusing on developing societies have reported heterogeneity in this association. Recent studies addressing the endogeneity between family size and children's education have also cast doubt on the homogeneity of the negative role of family size on children's education. The goal of this study is to examine the causal effect of family size on children's education in Brazil over a 30-year period marked by important social and demographic change, and across extremely different regions within the country. We implement a twin birth instrumental variable approach to the nationally representative 1977-2009 PNAD data. Our results suggest an effect of family size on education that is not uniform throughout a period of significant social, economic, and demographic change. Rather, the causal effect of family size on adolescents' schooling resembles a gradient that ranges from positive to no effect, trending to negative.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify the factors associated with the increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage requiring transfusion in Japanese twin pregnancies in comparison with those in Japanese singleton pregnancies.\nWe reviewed the obstetric records of all singleton and twin deliveries after 22 weeks' gestation at the Japanese Red Cross Katsushika Maternity Hospital from 2003 through 2011. Potential risk factors for transfusion due to hemorrhage after cesarean delivery were selected according to previous studies of postpartum hemorrhage or transfusion or both after delivery: maternal age, parity, previous cesarean deliveries, history of infertility therapies such as in vitro fertilization, gestational age at delivery, neonatal birth weight, placenta previa, uterine myoma\u22656 cm, hypertensive disorders, placental abruption, emergency cesarean deliveries and general anesthesia.\nUsing multiple logistic regression, the independent risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage requiring transfusion in singleton pregnancies were preterm delivery [odds ratio (OR) 2.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-4.6, p<0.01], placenta previa (OR 8.08, 95% CI 3.9-16, p<0.01) and placental abruption (OR 12.8, 95% CI 2.3-76, p<0.01). In twin pregnancies, however, the independent risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage requiring transfusion were gestational age at \u226541 weeks (OR 8.20, 95% CI 1.3-40, p<0.01) and hypertensive disorders (OR 5.45, 95% CI 2.2-14, p<0.01).\nThe factors associated with postpartum hemorrhage requiring transfusion in cesarean deliveries of twins seemed to be different from those in singleton cesarean deliveries.",

    "abstract": "There has been an overall increase in the incidence of multiple pregnancies and assisted reproduction technology is largely responsible for this rise. Although twins may appeal to couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF), they have been associated with serious health consequences to the babies, their mothers and the family unit, as well as having massive financial implications for the National Health Service. Transfer of more than one embryo during IVF is mainly responsible for IVF twins, and elective transfer of a single embryo at a time with cryopreservation of surplus embryos for later transfer has been shown to be an effective strategy to minimise the risk of twins without compromising IVF success rates. Factors that will impact on the success of the policy of elective single embryo transfer (eSET) include improvement in embryo selection for transfer, better cryopreservation techniques and adequate state funding for IVF. However, in implementing the policy of eSET it is important that each case is assessed on an individual basis since in some situations (e.g. in older women) the transfer of two embryos may be more cost effective. Adequate and continuous education of all stakeholders is essential if the policy of eSET is to be successful in the UK.",

    "abstract": "Comparison between groups of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins enables an estimation of the relative contribution of genetic and shared and nonshared environmental factors to phenotypic variability. Using DNA methylation profiling of \u223c20,000 CpG sites as a phenotype, we have examined discordance levels in three neonatal tissues from 22 MZ and 12 DZ twin pairs. MZ twins exhibit a wide range of within-pair differences at birth, but show discordance levels generally lower than DZ pairs. Within-pair methylation discordance was lowest in CpG islands in all twins and increased as a function of distance from islands. Variance component decomposition analysis of DNA methylation in MZ and DZ pairs revealed a low mean heritability across all tissues, although a wide range of heritabilities was detected for specific genomic CpG sites. The largest component of variation was attributed to the combined effects of nonshared intrauterine environment and stochastic factors. Regression analysis of methylation on birth weight revealed a general association between methylation of genes involved in metabolism and biosynthesis, providing further support for epigenetic change in the previously described link between low birth weight and increasing risk for cardiovascular, metabolic, and other complex diseases. Finally, comparison of our data with that of several older twins revealed little evidence for genome-wide epigenetic drift with increasing age. This is the first study to analyze DNA methylation on a genome scale in twins at birth, further highlighting the importance of the intrauterine environment on shaping the neonatal epigenome.",

    "abstract": "To assess the impact of the day of birth on twin mortality in a population sample.\nWe analyzed weekend versus weekday twin births from the United States national twin birth data for the periods 1989-2002. We computed adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to assess the association between infant mortality and weekday of birth using the Cox proportional hazards model.\nThe crude rates for all types of mortality were found to be significantly higher for twins born on weekends than on weekdays. After adjustment, only post-neonatal mortality risk was higher on weekends as compared to weekdays [Hazards ratio (HR)=1.19, CI: 1.04, 1.36]. Twins of white mothers were at greater risk for neonatal death (HR=1.16, CI: 1.08, 1.24) but were less likely to experience post-neonatal death (HR=0.68, CI: 0.64, 0.76) as compared to twins of black mothers. We found an interaction between maternal age and weekday of birth. Twins born on weekends to teenage mothers (age<18) had a 35% greater risk for neonatal death (HR=1.35, CI: 1.06, 1.71) while those born on weekends to older mothers did not show elevated risk for any of the mortality indices.\nIncreased risks for post-neonatal death are significantly higher amongst twins born on weekends as compared to weekdays. Further research is required to identify the detailed differences in structure and procedures that result in the disadvantage associated with weekend birth.",

    "abstract": "The most common pathology in adult patients with temporal lobe epilepsy is hippocampal sclerosis (HS), the etiology of which is not clear. There is a conflicting evidence in literature regarding whether HS is genetic or acquired. Twin studies can help to clarify the mechanisms of HS, but limited numbers of twins have been studied. We describe two monozygotic pairs, in whom the affected twin had mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and HS. The unaffected twin remained seizure free on long-term follow-up. HS was confirmed pathologically in one of the affected twins. Our data and other limited twin studies indicate that HS occurs as a consequence of prolonged repeated seizures or other events during childhood. In other words, some acquired factors may be more important than genetic ones in the etiology of HS (Fig. 2, Ref. 16).",

    "abstract": "Lamellar Ichthyosis is a rare condition requiring thickened collodion-like skin for clinical diagnosis. These infants have abnormal epidermal barrier, which leads to serious complications. It may present with extensive skin lesions and should be considered a diagnostic possibility in sick neonates. Recent studies have identified a condition characterized by deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA) resembling Ichthyosis. We report dizygotic twins that presented lamellar ichthyosis. Twin #1 had a neonatal period complicated with sepsis, fungemia and urinary tract infection. Twin #2 had sepsis, urinary tract infection and conjunctivitis. We tested the parents and one patient for DIRA. Tests were negative. To our knowledge, this is the first case of dizygotic twins that presented with lamellar ichthyosis in Puerto Rico. Physicians should include DIRA in the differential diagnosis of skin lesions in newborns.",

    "abstract": "We used diffusion tensor imaging to assess callosal morphology in 35 pairs of monozygotic twins, of which 17 pairs were concordant for handedness and 18 pairs were discordant for handedness. Functional hemispheric language dominance was established for each twin member using fMRI, resulting in 26 twin pairs concordant and 9 twin pairs discordant for language dominance. On the basis of genetic models of handedness and language dominance, which assume one \"right shift\" (RS) gene with two alleles, an RS+ allele biasing toward right-handedness and left cerebral language dominance and an RS- allele leaving both asymmetries to chance, all twins were classified according to their putative genotypes, and the possible effects of the gene on callosal morphology was assessed. Whereas callosal size was under a high genetic control that was independent of handedness and language dominance, twin pairs with a high probability of carrying the putative RS+ allele showed a connectivity pattern characterized by a genetically controlled, low anisotropic diffusion over the whole corpus callosum. In contrast, the high connectivity pattern exhibited by twin pairs more likely to lack the RS+ allele was under significantly less genetic influence. The data suggest that handedness and hemispheric dominance for speech production might be at least partly dependent on genetically controlled processes of axonal pruning in the corpus callosum.",

    "abstract": "Elevated pulse pressure (PP) is associated with cardiovascular disorders and mortality in various populations. The genetic influence on PP has been confirmed by heritability estimates using related individuals. Recently, efforts have been made by mapping genes that are linked to the phenotype. We report the results of our gene mapping studies conducted in the Chinese population in mainland China. The genome-wide linkage and association scans were carried out on 63 middle-aged dizygotic twin pairs using high-density markers. The linkage analysis identified three significant linkage peaks (all with a single point P<1e(-05)) on chromosome 11 (LOD core 4.06 at 30.5 cM), chromosome 12 (LOD score 3.97 at 100.7 cM) and chromosome 18 (LOD score 4.01 at 70.7 cM), with the last two peaks closely overlapping with linkage peaks reported by two American studies. Multiple regions with suggestive linkages were identified, with many of the peaks overlapping with published linkage regions. The genome-wide association analysis detected a suggestive association on chromosome 4 (rs17031508, P<8.34e(-08)) located within a wide region of suggestive linkage. Our results provide some evidence for genetic linkages and associations with PP in the Chinese population. Further investigation is warranted to replicate the findings and to explore the susceptibility loci or genes for PP.",

We analyzed the perinatal history, psychomotor behavior, language, and the presence of minor dysmorphism. Karyotypes and in situ hibridization (FISH) for critical region 22q13.3 were performed to all patients. There were hypotonia, developmental delay, and delay or absence of language. A 22q13.3 deletion was detected in all patients described, two cases had a deletion and the other three had a ring of chromosome 22, one in a pure cell line, while the twins presented mosaicism.

Based on univariate analysis, the Bishop score at 33-35 weeks was significantly associated with the risk of intrapartum cesarean delivery of twins, whereas cervical length, maternal age, height, and weight at 33-35 weeks were not associated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified induction of labor and birth weight of the first-born twin, but not Bishop score, as independent predictors of intrapartum cesarean delivery of twins.\nA low Bishop score at 33-35 weeks of gestation was associated with an increased risk of intrapartum cesarean delivery of twin gestations. However, this relationship disappeared after adjusting for relevant intrapartum or postpartum confounders. Only labor induction and high birth weight of the first-born twin were independently associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery in labor.",

    "abstract": "Most of the complex traits including aging phenotypes are caused by the interaction between genome and environmental conditions and the interface of epigenetics may be a central mechanism. Although modern technologies allow us high-throughput profiling of epigenetic patterns already at genome level, our understanding of genetic and environmental influences on the epigenetic processes remains limited. Twins are of special interest for genetic studies due to their genetic similarity and rearing-environment sharing. The classical twin design has made a great contribution in dissecting the genetic and environmental contributions to human diseases and complex traits. In the era of functional genomics, the valuable sample of twins is helping to bridge the gap between gene activity and the environments through epigenetic mechanisms unlimited by DNA sequence variations. We propose to extend the classical twin design to study the aging-related molecular epigenetic phenotypes and link them with environmental exposures especially early life events. Different study designs and application issues will be highlighted and novel approaches introduced with aim at making uses of twins in assessing the environmental impact on epigenetic changes during development and in the aging process.",

    "abstract": "The direction of causation between measures of disrupted sleep, anxiety and depression is not well understood. Under certain conditions, cross-sectional analysis based on genetically informative data can provide important information about the direction of causation between variables. Two community-based samples of 7235 Australian twins aged 18-87 years were mailed an extensive questionnaire that covered a wide range of personality and behavioral measures. Included were self-report measures of disrupted sleep, as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression. Among all females, modeling the direction of causation did not support the hypothesis of sleep having a direct causal impact on risk of anxiety or depression. Among older females, we found evidence that both anxiety and depression interact reciprocally with disrupted sleep, whereas among younger women both anxiety and depression appear to have a causal impact on sleep. Results for males were equivocal. The nosological implications of our findings are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Heteroplasmy, the mixture of mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA), varies among individuals and cells. Heteroplasmy levels alter the penetrance of pathological mtDNA mutations, and the susceptibility to age-related diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Although mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in age-related type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the involvement of heteroplasmy in diabetes is unclear. We hypothesized that the heteroplasmic mutational (HM) pattern may change in T2DM. To test this, we used next-generation sequencing, i.e. massive parallel sequencing (MPS), along with PCR-cloning-Sanger sequencing to analyze HM in blood and skeletal muscle DNA samples from monozygotic (MZ) twins either concordant or discordant for T2DM. Great variability was identified in the repertoires and amounts of HMs among individuals, with a tendency towards more mutations in skeletal muscle than in blood. Whereas many HMs were unique, many were either shared among twin pairs or among tissues of the same individual, regardless of their prevalence. This suggested a heritable influence on even low abundance HMs. We found no clear differences between T2DM and controls. However, we found ~5-fold increase of HMs in non-coding sequences implying the influence of negative selection (P < 0.001). This negative selection was evident both in moderate to highly abundant heteroplasmy (>5% of the molecules per sample) and in low abundance heteroplasmy (<5% of the molecules). Although our study found no evidence supporting the involvement of HMs in the etiology of T2DM, the twin study found clear evidence of a heritable influence on the accumulation of HMs as well as the signatures of selection in heteroplasmic mutations.",

    "abstract": "Cortical surface area has been largely overlooked in genetic studies of human brain morphometry, even though phylogenetic differences in cortical surface area between individuals are known to be influenced by differences in genetic endowment. In this study, we examined the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences on cortical surface areas in both the native and stereotaxic spaces for a cohort of homogeneously-aged healthy pediatric twins. Bilateral hemispheric surface and all lobar surface areas except the occipital lobes in native space showed high heritable estimates, while the common environmental effect on bilateral occipital lobes reached statistical significance. The proportion of genetic variance for cortical surface areas measured in stereotaxic space was lower than that measured in native space, whereas the unique environmental influences increased. This is reasonable since whole brain volume is also known to be heritable itself and so removing that component of areal variance due to overall brain size via stereotaxic transformation will reduce the genetic proportion. These findings further suggest that cortical surface areas involved in cognitive, attention and emotional processing, as well as in creating and retaining of long-term memories are likely to be more useful for examining the relationship between genotype and behavioral phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in neuroscience is finding which genes affect brain integrity, connectivity, and intellectual function. Discovering influential genes holds vast promise for neuroscience, but typical genome-wide searches assess approximately one million genetic variants one-by-one, leading to intractable false positive rates, even with vast samples of subjects. Even more intractable is the question of which genes interact and how they work together to affect brain connectivity. Here, we report a novel approach that discovers which genes contribute to brain wiring and fiber integrity at all pairs of points in a brain scan. We studied genetic correlations between thousands of points in human brain images from 472 twins and their nontwin siblings (mean age: 23.7 \u00b1 2.1 SD years; 193 male/279 female). We combined clustering with genome-wide scanning to find brain systems with common genetic determination. We then filtered the image in a new way to boost power to find causal genes. Using network analysis, we found a network of genes that affect brain wiring in healthy young adults. Our new strategy makes it computationally more tractable to discover genes that affect brain integrity. The gene network showed small-world and scale-free topologies, suggesting efficiency in genetic interactions and resilience to network disruption. Genetic variants at hubs of the network influence intellectual performance by modulating associations between performance intelligence quotient and the integrity of major white matter tracts, such as the callosal genu and splenium, cingulum, optic radiations, and the superior longitudinal fasciculus.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the incidence and predictive factors of poor neurological outcome in survivors of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) treated with fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (FLP).\nBrain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurodevelopmental assessment were performed at a corrected age of 1 year in survivors of TTTS treated by FLP. Severe neurological abnormality was defined as either the presence of severe clinical neurodevelopmental disability or severe anomalies, visualized on MRI of the brain.\nIn a consecutive series of 46 cases treated by FLP, the total survival rate was 66.3%; survival of at least one was 80.4%. Severe neurodevelopment disability was 6.7 % (4/59) and the presence of a severe anomaly on brain imaging was 8.8% (5/57), which combined to a clinical or MRI abnormality rate of 10.5% (6/57). Univariate analysis revealed that early gestational age at delivery was the most significant predictor. However, the multiple logistic regression model did not identify any significant variables.\nIn this small series, we determined a rate of clinical neurologic impairment rate at the age of 1 year of 6.7%, which compares to what has been published.",

    "abstract": "Intellectual deficits are commonly found in schizophrenia patients. These intellectual deficits have been found to be heritable. However, whether the intellectual deficits change over time and, if so, whether the change is related with an increased genetic risk for the disease are not known.\nWe investigated change of intelligence quotient (IQ) in a twin sample of chronically ill schizophrenia patients, the discordant co-twins and healthy controls during a follow-up period of 5 years. A total of 52 twins completed two IQ assessments: nine patients [three monozygotic (MZ) and six dizygotic (DZ)], 10 unaffected co-twins (three MZ and seven DZ) and 33 healthy control twins (21 MZ and 12 DZ).\nA significant interaction effect over time was found between IQ measurement and illness (F=4.22, df=1, p<0.05), indicating that change in IQ over time is significantly different between the groups. A stable course in IQ over time was found in the patients with schizophrenia (mean IQ from 109.78 at baseline to 108.44 at follow-up) relative to both the healthy control twins who showed a small increase (from 114.61 at baseline to 119.18 at follow-up) (t=2.06, p<0.05) and the unaffected co-twins (from 111.60 to 117.60, t=-2.32, p<0.05). IQ change in the unaffected co-twins of schizophrenia patients was comparable with that in healthy control twins (t=-0.49, p=0.63).\nPatients with schizophrenia in the chronic phase of the disease, but not the discordant co-twins, show a lack of increase in IQ, which is probably due to environmental (non-genetic) factors related to the disease.",

    "abstract": "The overall volume of the brain has been found to be under relatively strong genetic control, but the relative strength of genetic and environmental factors on between-person variations in regional cortical thickness in adolescence is still not well understood. Here, we analyzed structural MRI data from 108 14-year-old healthy twins (54 females/54 males) to determine the relative contributions of genes and the environment toward regional variations in gray matter thickness across the cortex. After extracting cortical thickness values at a high spatial resolution, an A/C/E structural equation model that divides the variations into additive genetic (A), shared (C), and unique (E) environmental components was fitted. There was considerable regional variability in the magnitude of genetic influences on cortical thickness after controlling for sex. Regions with genetic contributions of greater than 80% were observed in the prefrontal cortex, predominantly in the bilateral dorsolateral and mesial superior frontal regions. No region showed prominent shared environmental influences, but unique environmental influences of over 80% were found in parietal association regions. The genetic variance for cortical thickness in adolescents in prefrontal regions overlapped with previous findings in adults. However, the unique environmental effects observed in multimodal parietal association cortices with converging inputs from visual, auditory, somatosensory regions, and neighboring secondary association cortices suggest that these regional variations are more shaped by experience and could form targets for early interventions in youth with behavioral disorders.",

    "abstract": "In population-based studies, the prevalence of neurodevelopmental disability is consistently higher in twins than singletons. This is largely because birth weight and gestational age (GA) distributions of twin births are shifted to the left when compared with singleton births, and lower birth weight and lower GA are associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disability. From a pathophysiologic perspective, a question of interest is whether neurodevelopmental outcomes of twins differ from singletons after controlling for covariates. If significant differences in outcomes persist, this would suggest that the twining process itself or something intrinsic to shared life in the womb may be responsible for observed differences. From a clinical perspective, when counseling parents at risk for preterm delivery of twins, it is useful to understand how twin outcomes compare relative to singleton outcomes at the same birth weight or GA. The purpose of this review is to examine the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of twins compared with singletons with control for important covariates.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this article is to review current information regarding the management of twin gestations and discuss optimal pregnancy length and considerations regarding route of delivery. Limited data are available on the timing and mode of delivery for twins. For apparently uncomplicated twin pregnancies, current recommendations suggest the optimal length of gestation is 38 weeks for dichorionic diamniotic twins, 34-36 weeks for monochorionic diamniotic twins, and 32-34 weeks for monoamniotic twins. In general, vaginal trial of labor may be considered for cephalic-cephalic twins and in cases of cephalic-noncephalic twins where the provider's skills and experience allow. Cesarean is recommended in twin gestations with monoamnionicity, noncephalic presenting fetus, and those at high risk for combined vaginal-abdominal delivery. The optimal management of twin deliveries is controversial, with timing and mode of delivery dependent on multiple factors, including chorionicity, amnionicity, provider experience, and fetal presentation.",

    "abstract": "Following a brief introduction I address the relationships of twins from five different perspectives: the Intimate Connection, the Mirror Image and Complementarity, Object- and Self-Representation, Self and Object or Rivalry, and Intersubjective Communication. This approach attempts to understand twin relationships and the individual development of twins in terms of their intense mutual dependence, akin to infantile symbiosis, and in terms of narcissism. In their similarity to each other, twins may choose each other as love objects even as they see themselves in the other. That is, a twin may \"love what he himself is\" or \"someone who was once part of himself.\" This \"type of object-choice \u2026 must be termed 'narcissistic'\" (Freud, 1914, pp. 90, 88). Such \"cathexis of an undifferentiated self-object\" is considered to be \"primary narcissism\" (Burstein, 1977, p. 103). Hoffer (1952) describes primary narcissism as \"the lack of all qualities discriminating between self and not-self, inside and outside\" (p. 33).",

Virtual twins (VTs) are same-age, unrelated siblings reared together since infancy.

An updated analysis of IQ data, based on an increased sample of 142 VT pairs (7.87 years, SD=8.22), is presented. Intraclass correlations of .28 (IQ) and .11 (subtest profile) indicated modest shared environmental influences on intelligence.

    "abstract": "Left-ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is characterized by prominent myocardial trabeculae with deep intratrabecular recesses. Associated with ventricular dysfunction, LVNC can present in isolation or in conjunction with structural heart defects (i.e., \"nonisolated\" LVNC). Although it was once considered to be difficult and unreliable, successful detection of this condition by way of fetal echocardiography has been well documented. We present what is to our knowledge the first prenatal diagnosis of LVNC in monochorionic-monozygotic twins. Nonisolated LVNC was identified in twins A and B at 23 weeks' gestation. A noncompaction-to-compaction ratio >2 was documented in both cases. Discordance for congenital heart disease was observed in the twins: Twin A presented with pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum, critical tricuspid stenosis, and severe right-ventricular hypoplasia, whereas twin B presented with mild mitral valve dysplasia. Despite an initially complicated postnatal course for twin A, this case shows that it is feasible to achieve good outcomes with accurate prenatal detection and aggressive postnatal management.",

    "abstract": "The congenital vs acquired etiology of pediatric trigger thumb is the subject of considerable debate. Existing case reports of bilateral presentation in identical twins and first-degree familial association support the congenital hypothesis. However, prospective studies have yet to report a neonate presenting with this anomaly at birth. This article describes the first known set of dichorionic, monozygotic identical twins with unilateral trigger thumbs, affecting contralateral (mirror-image) hands and with asynchronous age at presentation (11 months and 18 months, respectively).Pediatric trigger thumb is caused by a mismatch between the flexor pollicis longus tendon and its A1 synovial pulley. Four sets of twins have been previously reported in the literature with trigger thumb. Of these, 3 sets were monozygotic twins who had bilaterally affected thumbs. Together with the absence of trauma, a congenital etiology was suggested. The fact that pediatric trigger thumb is generally seen several months after birth was felt to be due to infants holding their thumbs clutched in their palms until 6 months. However, no confirmed cases of trigger thumb have been diagnosed at birth in several large prospective studies of newborns.In the current case, the asynchronous presentation of unilateral trigger thumbs in identical twins does not support a solely congenital cause. Furthermore, the mirror-image presentation contradicts current embryological understanding of the temporal course of twinning and the determination of laterality. Thus, a multifactorial etiology is supported with both a genetic and acquired component affecting the development of this condition.",

    "abstract": "To describe the concordance of keratoconus in 18 sets of twins.\nThirteen monozygotic (MZ) and five dizygotic (DZ) pairs of twins were identified during an investigation of familial keratoconus. We used 16 forensic microsatellite markers to confirm the zygosity of same sex twins. Patients and available relatives were examined for signs of keratoconus using corneal topography. For each pair of twins, the severity of keratoconus in each eye was graded according to the steepest keratometry value and the average difference in score between the MZ and DZ twins compared.\nAll of the MZ twins and four of the five DZ twins were concordant for keratoconus but with differences in age of onset and severity of disease. The subjective age of onset of keratoconus tended to be earlier in the MZ twins (16.4 years, SD 4.66) than in the DZ twins (20.3 years, SD 7.55) (p=0.086). Additional relatives with keratoconus were identified in two (16%) of the families with MZ twins and in three (60%) of the families of DZ twins. The mean difference in severity scores was 1.4 (SD 1.73) for the MZ twins and 3.0 (SD 1.00) for the DZ twins (p=0.035).\nThis data provide evidence that the severity of keratoconus is more concordant in MZ than in DZ twins. The results support the currently accepted hypothesis of an important genetic contribution towards the pathogenesis of keratoconus, but suggest that there is also an environmental effect on the expression of disease.",

    "abstract": "We report on monochorionic diamniotic male twins discordant for the trisomy 12p syndrome. Trisomy 12p mosaicism with a supernumerary der(12)(pter > q12) was detected in approximately 50% of lymphocytes in both children. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) revealed a high grade mosaicism of approximately 77% trisomy 12p cells in buccal smear and 85% in hair follicles in the affected twin, while in the normal developing brother an additional 12p chromosome fragment could not be detected in those tissues. Instead, in 3% of buccal smear and hair follicle cells a minute supernumerary marker chromosome comprising central portions of chromosome 12 was observed. Trisomy 12p mosaicism, confined to the lymphocytes of the unaffected twin, may be due to prenatal twin-to-twin transfusion, explaining the conspicuously discordant clinical phenotype. We discuss the possible sequence of events leading to the cytogenetic findings and compare the clinical phenotype presented in the affected twin with other cases of trisomy 12p and tetrasomy 12p (Pallister-Killian syndrome).",

    "abstract": "To assess neonatal and maternal morbidity in twins \u2265 32 weeks' gestation, related to the changes in planned mode of delivery, a retrospective cohort study was performed, including 185 twin births delivered in the Atrium Medical Centre, Heerlen, during the years 2003-2008. The results were compared with those of an earlier study from our department during the period 1999-2002. Compared with the 1999-2002 cohort, the elective caesarean section rate significantly increased from 17.7% to 36.8%. The secondary caesarean rate significantly decreased from 15.9% to 8.8%, but increased from 1.2% to 3.3% for only twin B. No significant differences in serious neonatal morbidity rates for twins A and B were found between both study periods, neither in the elective caesarean group, nor in the planned vaginal birth group. Serious maternal morbidity was not significantly increased in both groups compared with the 1999-2002 cohort.",

    "abstract": "Renal coloboma syndrome (RCS) is a highly variable syndrome characterized by renal and ocular abnormalities. It is associated in about 50 % of cases with mutations of PAX2, a gene encoding a transcription factor required during development.\nThe case study involves two monozygotic twin sisters with RCS showing highly discordant phenotypes. Twin 1 was antenatally diagnosed with multiple cysts in the right kidney. She had complicated vacuum-assisted delivery with acute renal failure. She developed proteinuria at age 4 years, followed by a progressive rise in serum creatinine requiring renal replacement therapy at age 22. No ocular abnormalities have been detected. Twin 2 experienced rapidly reversible acute renal failure without renal morphological abnormalities at birth. At age 2 years, complete visual acuity loss of the left eye secondary to an optic disc coloboma was diagnosed. No significant events occurred until the age of 20, when clinical proteinuria was detected. Proteinuria remission was obtained by multidrug treatment. In both patients, a novel de novo mutation of PAX2 was detected, which leads to the substitution of a highly conserved cysteine (p.C52Y).\nThe patients described provide an extreme example of clinical variability in RCS. The role of environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors is discussed.",

    "abstract": "We assessed vascular programming in genetically identical monochorionic twin pairs with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) treated differently in utero by serial amnioreduction or fetal laser arterial photocoagulation. This case-control study re-assessed four twin groups at median 11 years comprising 20 pairs of monochorionic diamniotic twins: nine treated by amnioreduction (TTTS-amnio) and eleven by laser (TTTS-laser) with seven monochorionic and six dichorionic control pairs. Outcome measures were current blood pressure (BP), brachio-radial arterial stiffness derived from pulse wave velocity (PWV), resting microcirculation (Flux) and response to heating and post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia measured using laser Doppler. Potential confounders [PWV and BP at first study, current height, weight, heart rate and twin type (ex-recipient, ex-donor or heavier/lighter of pair)] were accounted for by Mixed Linear Models statistical methodology. PWV dichorionic > monochorionic (P = 0.024); systolic and diastolic BP dichorionic > TTTS-amnio and TTTS-laser (P = 0.004, P = 0.02 and P = 0.005, P = 0.02, respectively). Within-twin pair pattern of PWV discordance was similar in laser treated and dichorionic controls (heavier-born > lighter), opposite to TTTS-amnio and monochorionic controls. Flux monochorionic > dichorionic (P = 0.044) and heavier > lighter-born (P = 0.024). TTTS-laser and dichorionic diamniotic showed greatest hyperaemic responses (dichorionic > TTTS-amnio or monochorionic controls (P = 0.007, P = 0.025). Hyperaemic responses were slower in heavier-born twins (P = 0.005). In summary, monochorionic twins had lower BP, arterial stiffness and increased resting vasodilatation than dichorionic twins implying shared fetal circulation affects vascular development. Vascular responses in laser-TTTS were similar to dichorionic and opposite to TTTS-amnio suggesting a lasting effect of fetal therapy on vascular health.",

    "abstract": "The co-occurrence of suicidal ideation, depression, and conduct disturbance is likely explained in part by correlated genetic and environmental risk factors. Little is known about the specific nature of these associations. Structured interviews on 2,814 twins from the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral Development (VTSABD) and Young Adult Follow-Up (YAFU) yielded data on symptoms of depression, conduct disorder, and adolescent and young adult suicidal ideation. Univariate analyses revealed that the familial aggregation for each trait was explained by a combination of additive genetic and shared environmental effects. Suicidal ideation in adolescence was explained in part by genetic influences, but predominantly accounted for by environmental factors. A mixture of genetic and shared environmental influences explained ideation occurring in young adulthood. Multivariate analyses revealed that there are genetic and shared environmental effects common to suicidal ideation, depression, and conduct disorder. The association between adolescent suicidal ideation and CD was attributable to the same genetic and environmental risk factors for depression. These findings underscore that prevention and intervention strategies should reflect the different underlying mechanisms involving depression and conduct disorder to assist in identifying adolescents at suicidal risk.",

    "abstract": "Kleine-Levin syndrome is a rare sleep disorder of unknown etiology. It is characterized by intermittent periods of excessive sleepiness, cognitive disturbances and behavioral abnormalities. Nine cases of familial Kleine-Levin syndrome have been identified, but there are no reported cases describing twins that are affected by the syndrome.\nWe report the cases of 16-year-old monozygotic twin boys who both suffered from Kleine-Levin syndrome. In both cases, the onset of the first episode was preceded by an influenza infection. During symptomatic periods they slept for the entire day except for meals and bathroom visits. Actimetry recordings revealed that during symptomatic periods, daily activity was lower than that of asymptomatic periods, on the other hand, activity during the night was significantly higher in symptomatic periods than asymptomatic periods. Polysomnography (PSG) data during symptomatic periods revealed a decrease in sleep efficiency. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing revealed no DQB1*02 loci. They were administered lithium carbonate but the beneficial effect was limited.\nOur observations suggest that Kleine-Levin syndrome may be due to genetic and autoimmune processes, although etiologic relationship to specific HLA type remains controversial.",

    "abstract": "Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a complex disorder with altered cardiovascular loading conditions that affects both donors and recipients. Myocardial tissue deformation analysis using vector velocity imaging is an angle-independent, speckle-tracking technique which can assess myocardial mechanics and may provide insight into cardiac dysfunction in TTTS.\nDigital dynamic two-dimensional four-chamber views were interrogated offline. Images were acquired utilizing standard video frame rates (30 frames/s). The global longitudinal strain, systolic strain rate, and diastolic strain rate were measured in the left (LV) and right ventricles (RV) of 25 fetal pairs with TTTS and compared to 25 gestational age-matched normal controls. Pulsatility indices for the umbilical artery and middle cerebral artery were measured.\nThe gestational age at evaluation was 20.5 \u00b1 1.3 weeks. The donor LV systolic strain rate was higher, while the donor RV diastolic strain rate was significantly lower, than control values. The recipient longitudinal strain, systolic strain rate, and diastolic strain rate were significantly lower for both LV and RV in comparison to controls. The donor umbilical artery pulsatility index was higher than control values (1.92 \u00b1 0.45 vs. 1.41 \u00b1 0.25, p < 0.001), while the donor middle cerebral artery pulsatility index was lower (1.46 \u00b1 0.28 vs. 1.87 \u00b1 0.21). Recipient umbilical artery and middle cerebral artery pulsatility indices were no different than control values.\nIn TTTS, both the donor and the recipient exhibit abnormalities of myocardial tissue deformation with ventricle-specific changes evident based on loading conditions. Donor LV systolic function is hyperdynamic due to hypovolemia and selective ejection into a low-resistance cerebrovascular circuit while the donor RV selectively ejects into a high-resistance placental circuit. Recipient RV and LV are both globally depressed with systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Further prospective validation of our findings using high frame rate analysis is indicated.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the prevalence and etiology of tobacco use in Asian populations. This study aims to test whether the finding of substantial heritability for tobacco-related phenotypes in Western populations is generalizable to developing countries. The twin method was used to estimate the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences on nicotine-related phenotypes. Participants were selected from the population based Sri Lankan Twin Registry. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was administered to 1,804 male individuals to assess five phenotypes: nicotine use; desire and unsuccessful attempts to quit smoking; subjective feeling of being tobacco dependent; and two DSM-IV diagnoses; nicotine dependence and nicotine withdrawal. Almost one-third of the male twins were life-time smokers. The genetic results were consistent with the previously reported findings from Western and Chinese populations, in that the nicotine use traits were significantly heritable, with environmental influences being of the non-shared nature. The results derived from the Causal Contingent Common pathway model (CCC) supported previous findings that show that liabilities to regular smoking and subsequent problem smoking have both shared and specific genetic influences.",

    "abstract": "Dermatoglyphic traits in a sample of twins were analyzed to estimate the resemblance between MZ and DZ twins and to evaluate the mode of inheritance by using the maximum likelihood-based Variance decomposition analysis. The additive genetic variance component was significant in both sexes for four traits--PII, AB_RC, RC_HB, and ATD_L. AB RC and RC_HB had significant sex differences in means, whereas PII and ATD_L did not. The results of the Bivariate Variance decomposition analysis revealed that PII and RC_HB have a significant correlation in both genetic and residual components. Significant correlation in the additive genetic variance between AB_RC and ATD_L was observed. The same analysis only for the females sub-sample in the three traits RBL, RBR and AB_DIS shows that the additive genetic RBR component was significant and the AB_DIS sibling component was not significant while others cannot be constrained to zero. The additive variance for AB DIS sibling component was not significant. The three components additive, sibling and residual were significantly correlated between each pair of traits revealed by the Bivariate Variance decomposition analysis.",

    "abstract": "Discordant birth weight twins have been shown to have high rates of adverse perinatal outcomes, but little is known about their growth and development.\nTo determine whether smaller and larger birth weight premature twins in concordant and discordant birth weight groups differ on measures of physical growth and intelligence at 3 years.\nProspective cohort study. Eight-four children, 52 concordant and 32 discordant birth weight twin pairs, were measured for height, weight, and head circumference and on intelligence at 3 years. Perinatal and demographic variables, including birth weight, head circumference, small for gestational age, zygosity, in vitro fertilization, gender and social class were recorded.\nSmaller and larger birth weight twins did not differ significantly from each other on any growth parameters in either concordant or discordant birth weight groups at 3 years of age. Smaller birth weight twins in the discordant birth weight group performed significantly less well on Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQ scores (Verbal IQ for smaller twins was 8.6 points lower, p<0.005; Performance IQ, 11.9 points lower, p<0.03; Full Scale IQ, 12.4 points lower, p<0.004), but there were no significant intra-twin differences between larger and smaller birth weight concordant twins.\nSmaller discordant birth weight twins performed significantly less well on intelligence, although they did not differ significantly from their larger twins on growth parameters at 3 years old. We conclude that smaller discordant birth weight twins had less optimal intra-uterine environments than their larger birth weight twin, which affected both their birth weights and brain development.",

Because of the anatomic continuity of the colon into the rectum, cancers affecting these organs have historically been considered equivalent. In this Prospective, we discuss the clinical and experimental data suggesting that colon cancer and rectal cancer are highly related, but distinct, diseases. Reconsidering the relationship between these cancers has implications for the development of new therapeutic paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Hallucinations are common in normal individuals and patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Traditionally psycho-social approaches have emphasized the importance of environmental factors that contribute to variation of hallucinations. Using the Launay-Slade Hallucination Scale-Revised (LSHS-R), we investigated genetic and environmental influences on hallucinations in 598 pairs of healthy South Korean adolescent twins. Parameter estimates in the best-fitting model indicated that additive genetic and individual specific environmental factors for the LSHS-R were 33% (95% CI: 23-42%) and 67% (95% CI: 60-77%), respectively. There was no evidence for sex-specific genes for hallucinations. The magnitudes of genetic and environmental influences on hallucinations were similar in males and females. These results have implications in future molecular genetic studies that search for genes for hallucinations.",

    "abstract": "Testosterone is the key hormone for the development of male reproductive organs and secondary sexual characteristics. In addition, testosterone is associated with behavioural traits, including sexual behaviour and social dominance. The level of circulating testosterone in the human body is determined by genetic and environmental factors. Twin studies have shown moderate to high heritability in adolescence and adulthood, but heritability in early childhood has not been investigated. This study aimed at disentangling the genetic and environmental contributions to testosterone levels soon after birth.\nUsing a sample of 314 twin pairs, saliva testosterone levels were measured at 5 months after birth. Quantitative genetic modelling was used to assess genetic and environmental contributions to the variation in testosterone levels.\nVariation in testosterone levels was explained by common (56.6%) and unique (43.4%) environmental factors.\nTaken together, these data from the largest study of twin testosterone levels suggest that, in contrast to findings in adulthood, environmental factors determine the interindividual variability in testosterone levels in early infancy. This may have consequences for the development of sex-related behaviour during childhood and calls for studies designed to unravel specific genetic and environmental factors involved in this process.",

    "abstract": "The brain has been commonly regarded as a \"tissue behind walls.\" Appearance of immune cells in the brain has been taken as a sign of pathology. Moreover, since infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages and activated resident microglia were indistinguishable by conventional means, both populations were considered together as inflammatory cells that should be mitigated. Yet, because the microglia permanently reside in the brain, attributing to them negative properties evoked an ongoing debate; why cells that are supposed to be the brain guardians acquire only destructive potential? Studies over the last two decades in the immune arena in general, and in the context of central nervous system pathology in particular, have resulted in a paradigm shift toward a more balanced appreciation of the contributions of immune cells in the context of brain maintenance and repair, and toward the recognition of distinct roles of resident microglia and infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages.",

    "abstract": "The way people cope with stressors of day to day living has an important influence on health. The aim of the present study was to explore whether genetic and environmental variations in stress-coping differ over time during adulthood. The brief COPE was mailed to a large sample of the UK female twins (N = 4,736) having a wide range of age (20-87 years). Factor analyses of the items of the brief COPE yielded three coping scales: 'Problem-Solving', 'Support Seeking', and 'Avoidance'. Monozygotic and dizygotic twin correlations tended to become lower with age for all three scales, suggesting that unique environmental factors may become more important with age during adulthood. Model-fitting results showed that relative influences of unique environmental factors increased from 60 % at age 20 years to 74% at age 87 years for 'Problem-Solving' and 56 % at age 20 years to 76% at age 87 years for 'Avoidance'. During the same age period, genetic factors decreased from 40 to 26 % for 'Problem-Solving' and from 44 to 24 % for 'Avoidance'. For 'Seeking Support', the magnitude of genetic and unique environmental factors was not significantly different across the adulthood. For all three scales, shared environmental effects were negligible. Overall, our findings implicate that the effects of environment that stem from idiosyncratic experience of stressful life events accumulate and become increasingly important in adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Research on the genetic influences on different abstract reasoning skills (fluid intelligence) and their interrelation (especially in childhood/adolescence) has been sparse. A novel cognitive test battery, the Verbal and Spatial Reasoning test for Children (VESPARCH 1), consisting of four matched (in terms of test-procedure and design) subtests assessing verbal [analogical (VA) and categorical (VC)] and spatial [analogical (SA) and categorical (SC)] reasoning, was administered to a population based sample of 12-year old twins (169 pairs). Multivariate analysis was conducted to explore the genetic relationship between the four cognitive sub-domains. Heritabilities were 0.62 (VA), 0.49 (VC), 0.52 (SA), and 0.20 (SC). Genetic influences were due to one common factor with no specific genetic influences. This shared genetic factor also explained almost the entire covariance between the domains, as environmental variance was largely specific to each subtest. The finding of no genetic influences specific to each subtest may be due to the uniquely matched design of the VESPARCH 1, reducing confoundment of different test modalities used in conventional tests. For future research or when interpreting previous studies, our findings highlight the importance of taking such potential artefacts (i.e. different test modalities for different sub-domains) into account when exploring the relationship between cognitive sub-domains.",

The heritability of BMI when sleep duration was < 7 hr (h\u00b2 = 70%) was more than twice as large as the heritability of BMI when sleep duration was \u2265 9 hr (h\u00b2 = 32%); this interaction was significant (P < 0.05).\nShorter sleep duration is associated with increased BMI and increased genetic influences on BMI, suggesting that shorter sleep duration increases expression of genetic risks for high body weight. At the same time, longer sleep duration may suppress genetic influences on body weight. Future research aiming to identify specific genotypes for BMI may benefit by considering the moderating role of sleep duration.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion imaging can map anatomical connectivity in the living brain, offering new insights into fundamental questions such as how the left and right brain hemispheres differ. Anatomical brain asymmetries are related to speech and language abilities, but less is known about left/right hemisphere differences in brain wiring. To assess this, we scanned 457 young adults (age 23.4\u00b12.0 SD years) and 112 adolescents (age 12-16) with 4-Tesla 105-gradient high-angular resolution diffusion imaging. We extracted fiber tracts throughout the brain with a Hough transform method. A 70\u00d770 connectivity matrix was created, for each subject, based on the proportion of fibers intersecting 70 cortical regions. We identified significant differences in the proportions of fibers intersecting left and right hemisphere cortical regions. The degree of asymmetry in the connectivity matrices varied with age, as did the asymmetry in network topology measures such as the small-world effect.",

    "abstract": "Primary spontaneous pneumothorax from subpleural bleb disease is an uncommon occurrence in pediatric patients. This is a rare case of monozygotic twins presenting at alternating intervals with a single-sided spontaneous pneumothorax, only to have it surgically corrected, and to present later with a subsequent contralateral pneumothorax. A review of familial spontaneous pneumothoraces occurring in children was queried for congenital or genetic syndromes. We concluded that a vast majority of pneumothoraces in children, like adults, are not spontaneous and not familial linked. While they are rare, some congenital syndromes have been identified. The HLA haplotype A2 B40, the gene encoding folliculin, Alph-1-antitrypsin, Marfan's syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome have all been associated with familial spontaneous pneumothoraces. Physicians need to counsel family members to ensure appropriate observation and expedited treatment is not delayed.",

    "abstract": "Twin pregnancies and births resulting from assisted reproductive technologies have been associated with adverse perinatal outcomes and maternal health complications leading to psychologically complex parenting. In the current study the authors assess the prevalence of clinical levels of maternal stress among mothers of twins resulting from in vitro fertilization and examine the association of social coping resources with three maternal stress sub-scales. During the years 2003-2005, 88 primiparous Israeli mothers of in vitro fertilization-conceived twins provided socio-demographic data during their third trimester of pregnancy, and at 6 months after birth provided data on delivery and medical condition of infants, coping resources (social support and marital quality), and a maternal stress scale. Forty-one percent of the mothers reached a clinically significant level of maternal stress. Social support and maternal employment were the most significant variables associated with experience of the stress in the early stages of adaptation to mothering in vitro fertilization twins. Primiparous mothers of in vitro fertilization twins are vulnerable to maternal stress in early stages of adaptation to the maternal role, some of whom reach clinical levels that may require professional interventions. Unemployed mothers with low social support were the most susceptible to the deleterious effects of in vitro fertilization treatment.",

    "abstract": "To further investigate brain structure and function in 26 handedness discordant monozygotic twin pairs (MzHd), MRI and behavioural assessments were carried out. These showed significant correlation between language-specific functional laterality in inferior and middle frontal gyri, and anterior corpus callosum. Previous studies of handedness discordant monozygotic twins failed to resolve the issue concerning handedness and hemispheric laterality for language due to methodological disparities. The results would be relevant to genetic theories as well as to brain structure:function explanations. MzHd twins underwent MRI and fMRI scanning as well as behavioural assessment of motor performance and cognition. There were significant differences on MRI and fMRI laterality measures, as well as a significant correlation between anterior callosal widths and functional laterality. LH twins showed higher frequencies of atypical functional laterality. There was no significant within-twin pair correlation on fMRI verbal laterality, nor did results show within-twin pair differences on verbal fluency or IQ. Implications for the field of laterality research pertain to frontal hemispheric equipotentiality for verbal processes in healthy individuals. In particular, there can be an apparent lack of cognitive 'cost' to atypical laterality. An fMRI verbal laterality index correlated significantly with corpus callosum widths near Broca's area.",

    "abstract": "Internalizing and externalizing problem behavior at school can have major consequences for a child and is predictive for disorders later in life. Teacher ratings are important to assess internalizing and externalizing problems at school. Genetic epidemiological studies on teacher-rated problem behavior are relatively scarce and the reported heritability estimates differ widely. A unique feature of teacher ratings of twins is that some pairs are rated by different and others are rated by the same teacher. This offers the opportunity to assess gene-environment interaction.\nTeacher ratings of 3,502 7-year-old, 3,134 10-year-old and 2,193 12-year-old twin pairs were analyzed with structural equation modeling. About 60% of the twin pairs were rated by the same teacher. Twin correlations and the heritability of internalizing and externalizing behavior were estimated, separately for pairs rated by the same and different teachers. Socioeconomic status and externalizing behavior at age 3 were included as covariates.\nTwin correlations and heritability estimates were higher when twin pairs were in the same class and rated by the same teacher than when pairs were rated by different teachers. These differences could not be explained by twin confusion or rater bias. When twins were rated by the same teacher, heritability estimates were about 70% for internalizing problems and around 80% in boys and 70% in girls for externalizing problems. When twins were rated by different teachers, heritability estimates for internalizing problems were around 30% and for externalizing problems around 50%.\nExposure to different teachers during childhood may affect the heritability of internalizing and externalizing behavior at school. This finding points to gene-environment interaction and is important for the understanding of childhood problem behavior. In addition, it could imply an opportunity for interventions at school.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for complex diseases may help to find disease mechanisms that are not due to genetic variants. Intermittent allergic rhinitis (IAR) is an optimal disease model because it occurs at defined time points each year, owing to known external antigens. We hypothesized that MZ twins discordant for IAR could help to find gene expression differences that are not dependent on genetic variants. We collected blood outside of the season from MZ twins discordant for IAR, challenged their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with pollen allergen in vitro, collected supernatants and isolated CD4+ T cells. We identified disease-relevant mRNAs and proteins that differed between the discordant MZ twins. By contrast, no differences in microRNA expression were found. Our results indicate that MZ twins discordant for IAR is an optimal model to identify disease mechanisms that are not due to genetic variants.",

    "abstract": "Studies addressing the role of somatic copy number variation (CNV) in the genesis of congenital heart defects (CHDs) are scarce, as cardiac tissue is difficult to obtain, especially in non-affected individuals. We explored the occurrence of copy number differences in monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for the presence of a CHD, as an illustrative model for chromosomal mosaicism in CHDs. Array comparative genomic hybridization was performed on peripheral blood-derived DNA obtained from 6 discordant MZ twin pairs and on sex-matched reference samples. To identify CNV differences between both twin members as well as potential CNVs in both twins contributing to the phenotype, DNA from each twin was hybridized against its co-twin, and against a normal control. Three copy number differences in 1 out of 6 MZ twin pairs were detected, confirming the occurrence of somatic CNV events in MZ twins. Further investigation by copy number and (epi)genome sequencing analyses in MZ twins, discordant for the presence of CHDs, is required to improve our knowledge on how postzygotic genetic, environmental and stochastic factors can affect human heart development.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to: (1) determine concordance rates of self-reported and subjectively determined indicators of oral malodor in twins; (2) determine the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to levels of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in intraoral and exhaled breath. Fifty-one twin pairs participated in the study. Measurements of VSCs were obtained by a halimeter. The presence of tongue coatings was determined and twins filled out a 32-item questionnaire on oral malodor indicators independently of one another. Estimates of heritability (h2) for halimeter measurements were computed by SOLAR. The concordance rates for the presence of tongue coating among identical and fraternal twins were 67% and 11%, respectively. In the 10 most informative items, 70% exhibited higher concordance rates for identical than for fraternal twins. Of particular interest were the differences in concordance rates for dry mouth, sinus infection and unusual sweating. The h2 for intraoral breath was 0.28 +/- 0.17 (NS), whereas the h2 for exhaled breath was 0.50 +/- 0.20 (p = .0207). The concordance rates of tongue coatings and malodor indicators were higher in identical twins than in fraternal twins. Intraoral breath VSC values were primarily attributable to environmental factors, whereas exhaled breath VSC values were partially explained by genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Substituted triphenylenes and similar discotic molecules have a strong tendency toward columnar organization. Nematic mesophases are much less commonly observed in discotic systems. We have demonstrated a general strategy whereby discotic triphenylenes can be twinned to form stable, boardlike materials that display only nematic mesophases. The dominant structural feature that leads to nematic behavior is an enforced void region in the center of the macrocycle that results from bridging through the triphenylene 3,6-positions. This precludes simple columnar assembly because it would lead to free space through the center of each stack. Selection of appropriate bridging units allows materials to be designed which combine molecular features, such as the optoelectronic properties of electron-rich triphenylenes and conjugated thiophene units, with the processability, self-healing, and alignment features inherent in nematic mesophases. In addition, communication across twinned structures can lead to additional enhancement of optoelectronic behavior. This is particularly apparent in fully conjugated, planar twin 12 which is formally expected to have some antiaromatic character. This character is manifested in its spectral properties, and particularly noteworthy is its strong, Stokes shifted emission at around 500 nm.",

    "abstract": "The question regarding the optimal age of delivery in twins remains unanswered. A prospective observational study was carried out in the gynaecology and obstetrics department of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata during 2008-2009 to arrive at a logical conclusion to this question. The objective of this study was to evaluate the optimal timing of delivery in twins and compare the perinatal outcome in these babies by dividing them into 3 groups: 34 weeks to 35 weeks 6 days, 36 weeks to 37 weeks 6 days and >38 weeks. Perinatal outcome was also compared between different modes of delivery. Few maternal complications like pre-eclampsia, anaemia, premature rupture of membrane, preterm labour and antepartum haemorrhage were also evaluated.",

Although both disorders are characterized by changes in brain structure, family studies suggest more segregating than overlapping neuroanatomical abnormalities in both disorders.\nTo investigate whether patients with schizophrenia and patients with BD display overlapping abnormalities in brain volumes and cortical thickness and whether these are caused by shared genetic or environmental influences.\nMagnetic resonance imaging findings of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia, twin pairs concordant and discordant for BD, and healthy twin pairs were compared using structural equation modeling.\nThe Netherlands Twin Register and University Medical Center Utrecht.\nA total of 310 individuals from 158 (152 complete and 6 incomplete) twin pairs were included: 26 pairs discordant for schizophrenia (13 MZ and 13 DZ), 49 pairs with BD (9 MZ and 4 DZ concordant; 14 MZ and 22 DZ discordant), and 83 healthy twin pairs (44 MZ and 39 DZ).\nEstimates of additive genetic and unique environmental associations between schizophrenia and BD with overlapping and nonoverlapping volumes and cortical thickness.\nHigher genetic liabilities for schizophrenia and BD were associated with smaller white matter volume, thinner right (and left) parahippocampus, thinner right orbitofrontal cortex, and thicker temporoparietal and left superior motor cortices; higher environmental liabilities were associated with thinner right medial occipital cortex. Genetic liability for schizophrenia was associated with thicker right parietal cortex; for BD, with larger intracranial volume.\nBrain structures reflect overlapping and segregating genetic liabilities for schizophrenia and BD. The overlapping smaller white matter volume and common areas of thinner cortex suggest that both disorders share genetic (neurodevelopmental) roots.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal exposure to adverse environmental conditions is related to increased adult mortality in regions where infections are highly prevalent, yet there is little evidence of the impact of perinatal conditions on the risk of severe infections throughout life. Using prospectively collected data from 21\u2003604 like-sexed Swedish twins of known zygosity born in 1926-1958, we examined the risk of polio in relation to perinatal characteristics using cohort and nested co-twin case-control analyses. Polio incidence was determined through an interview in 1998, and linkage with the Swedish national inpatient and death registries. There were 133 cases of polio. In the cohort analysis, birth length, birthweight and head circumference were positively associated with polio risk. After adjustment for sex, birth year, gestational age at birth and within-twin pair correlations, twins of shortest length (<44\u2003cm) had a 67% ([95% CI: 6%, 88%]; P=0.04) lower risk of polio compared with the reference group (47-49\u2003cm). After additional adjustment for birth length, every 100-g increase in birthweight was related to a 34% increased risk of polio ([95% CI: -1%, 82%]; P=0.06), and every 10-mm increase in head circumference was related to a 17% greater risk of polio ([95% CI: 5%, 31%]; P=0.004). In co-twin control analyses among 226 disease-discordant twins, birth length, birthweight and head circumference were 0.3\u2003cm (P=0.19), 84\u2003g (P=0.07) and 3\u2003mm (P=0.08) higher in cases than controls, respectively. Similar associations were observed among monozygotic (n=84) and dizygotic (n=142) twins. These findings suggest that early intrauterine growth restriction may be inversely related to the incidence of polio.",

    "abstract": "To (i) document the incidence of multiplicity in Nigeria, (ii) compare healthcare utilization during pregnancy and at delivery for singleton and multiple pregnancies (iii)and investigate whether antenatal care modifies the relationship between multiplicity and likelihood of having skilled attendance.\nThis observational study was a secondary analysis of the 2008 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey and included 17,635 women who gave birth to a live infant between 2003 and 2008. Multivariate logistic regression with adjustment for weighting, clustering and confounding was used to investigate associations and look for effect modification.\nThere were 18.5 multiple pregnancies per 1000 maternities. Multiple births had nearly six times the chance of neonatal mortality (AOR 5.74). Mothers with multiple births had more skilled attendance (AOR 1.75), but similar antenatal care utilization (AOR 0.95) as women with a singleton pregnancy. Women with multiple pregnancies attending antenatal care had more visits (mean 9.0 vs. 8.2), blood pressure checks (OR 1.52) and urine tests (OR 1.51). Although antenatal care was strongly associated with skilled attendance, there was no evidence that this was more so for twins than singletons.\nMultiplicity in Nigeria is not just a common occurrence, but an indicator of a high-risk pregnancy. The fact that the use of antenatal care by women with a multiple pregnancy is not associated with a disproportionately greater use of skilled delivery care raises questions about the quality of antenatal services. Services should encourage and link all women and especially high-risk women to skilled attendance at delivery.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review aims to determine if there are evidence-based recommendations for the optimal mode of delivery for non-cephalic presenting first- and/or second twins. We investigated the impact of the mode of delivery on neonatal outcome for twin deliveries with (1) the first twin (twin A) in non-cephalic presentation, (2) the second (twin B) in non-cephalic presentation and (3) both twins in non-cephalic presentation.\nA computer-aided search of Medline, Embase, Cinahl and Cochrane databases was carried out and quality of the studies was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias and the GRADE approach.\nOne high-quality clinical trial (60 twin pairs) and 16 moderate/low-quality observational studies (3,167 twin pairs) showed no difference in neonatal outcome between vaginal and caesarean delivery in twin A and/or B.\nOur results do not suggest benefit of caesarean over vaginal delivery for selected twin gestations with twin A and/or twin B in non-cephalic presentation. However, no final conclusion can be drawn due to the small sample sizes and statistic limitations of the included studies.

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins with discordant karyotypes are rare. We report a case of monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 13 by amniocyte karyotypes. Ultrasound revealed multiple congenital anomalies in Twin A (47,XY,+13), none in Twin B (46,XY), and monochorionic-diamniotic placentation. Zygosity testing performed both prenatally and after birth supported monozygosity. Twin A died in the neontal period. Twin B survived and had normal physical examination, but peripheral blood karyotype revealed 20% mosaicism for trisomy 13. Monochorionic-diamniontic placentation with vascular anastomoses was confirmed by pathological examination. In this paper, we discuss the various mechanisms by which monozygotic twins may have discordant karyotypes. The surviving twin, structurally and developmentally normal at 6 months of age, will be monitored for potential complications of uniparental disomy of chromosome 13 and trisomy 13 mosaicism.",

    "abstract": "The human endogenous retroviral family W, Env(C7), member 1 gene (HERVWE1) is thought to participate in trophoblast cell fusion, and its expression is diminished in the placentas of singleton intrauterine growth-retarded pregnancies. However, there is limited information about the role of HERVWE1 in discordant fetal growth in twins. This study was to compare HERVWE1 gene expression between the placentas of discordant monozygotic twins and to identify its regulation by methylation.\nFetuses from twenty-one pairs of monozygotic, dichorionic, discordant twins were marked as \"smaller\" or \"larger\" according to birth weight. Placental HERVWE1 mRNA and protein expression profiles were analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Methylation profiles of the HERVWE1 promoter region were analyzed using a pyrosequencing assay. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) transcript levels were analyzed by RT-PCR. 5-methyl cytosine (5-MC) was stained using an immunohistochemical assay. There was a significant negative correlation between HERVWE1 mRNA levels and birth weight in twins (P<0.01). Whereas the mean methylation level of the HERVWE1 promoter region was diminished in the smaller group in discordant twins(P<0.01), increased mRNA and protein levels of HERVWE1 were found in smaller fetuses compared with larger fetuses in discordant twins(P<0.01). There was no significant difference in 5-MC staining intensity between discordant twins (P>0.05). The DNMT3b3 mRNA levels in the smaller group were significantly downregulated compared with the larger group in discordant twins(P<0.05), whereas the DNMT3b7 mRNA levels in the smaller group were significantly upregulated compared with the larger group in discordant twins(P<0.05).\nIn discordant, monozygotic, dichorionic twins, HERVWE1 expression was higher in smaller fetuses and lower in larger fetuses. Methylation of the HERVWE1 gene promoter region may participate in the regulation of HERVWE1 gene expression in discordant twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "The pathoetiology of craniosynostosis is not well understood. It likely results from a combination of genetic and epigenetic phenomena, such as intrauterine constraint from multiple gestations. Information on craniosynostosis in twins is limited to case reports and series. The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to elucidate the genetic and nongenetic influences of twins on the pathogenesis of craniosynostosis.\nPubMed and Ovid databases were reviewed for the key terms \"craniosynostosis and twins.\" Data analyzed included demographical information, incidence rates, concordance, and phenotypic variability. Risk factors for craniosynostosis, concordance, and phenotypic variability were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. A case series was presented.\nData were extracted from 34 journal articles, including the authors' five patients, and representing a total of 199 twins with craniosynostosis. Twinning was 2.62 times greater in patients with craniosynostosis (6.29 percent) compared with unaffected controls (2.4 percent; p < 0.0001). Boys were affected more than girls (65.30 versus 34.70 percent, respectively; p < 0.0001). Monozygotic concordance rates were greater than dizygotic (60.90 versus 5.30 percent, respectively; p < 0.0001) but were not 100 percent. Phenotypic variability was present in 62 percent of monozygotic twin sets (p < 0.05).\nIncreased concordance rates among monozygotic compared with dizygotic twins confirm the genetic role of twins on craniosynostosis. Evidence to support the epigenetic influence of twinning on the pathogenesis of craniosynostosis includes the elevated incidence of twins among a craniosynostotic population compared with unaffected twins in the general population and male gender predominance, as well as monozygotic phenotypic variability and discordance.\nRisk, IV.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to describe the oral health environment in preschool children and to examine the extent to which paired twins experience the same oral health environment.\nIn collaboration with The Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN) 100 twin families who participated in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort, were invited to take part in ongoing studies on oral health. Participating twin families lived in Oslo and the surrounding counties of the capital. The age range of the participating twins was 1-8 years. A clinical examination took place at The Institute of Clinical Dentistry, University of Oslo in 2008. The oral health environment was measured in two ways: 1) Interview. Mothers were interviewed by trained interviewers about oral health related habits of each of the twins. 2) Weekend diet log. Parents listed 84 different deserts, ice cream, sweets, cakes, cookies, fruits, snacks, and biscuits for each twin that were consumed on during the weekend. The statistical analyses comprised frequency distributions of the environmental variables and correlations between the variables within the pair of twins.\nThe results showed a parental involvement in early tooth brushing and also an indication of tooth brushing not always being easy. Use of fluoride toothpaste started early, and two thirds of the children also used fluoride tablets. Use of pacifier was prevalent; the duration of use of pacifier and feeding bottle was relatively long. Nearly 75% of the parents indicated that they had no problems relatively to the twins' meals, and 53% mentioned that the twin pairs were different with regard to meals. Nearly 70% of the kindergartens had a clear health profile. The correlations varied between r = 0.45 and 1.00.\nThe children in the present work were young, and the detailed information in this paper therefore adds to the knowledge of parental involvement in children's oral health. Generally the findings indicate a high level of involvement from the parents in the oral health environment at home. Altogether the results showed that the assumption of identical oral health environment cannot be supported by these data.",

    "abstract": "Familial influences on remission from alcohol use disorder (AUD) have been studied using family history of AUD rather than family history of remission. The current study used a remission phenotype in a twin sample to examine the relative contributions of genetic and environmental influences to remission.\nThe sample comprised 6183 twins with an average age of 30 years from the Australian Twin Registry. Lifetime history of alcohol abuse and dependence symptoms and symptom recency were assessed with a structured telephone interview. AUD was defined broadly and narrowly as history of two or more or three or more abuse or dependence symptoms. Remission was defined as absence of symptoms at time of interview among individuals with lifetime AUD. Standard bivariate genetic analyses were conducted to derive estimates of genetic and environmental influences on AUD and remission.\nEnvironmental influences alone accounted for remission in males and for 89% of influences on remission in females, with 11% due to genetic influences shared with AUD, which decreased the likelihood of remission. For women, more than 80% of influences on remission were distinct from influences on AUD, and environmental influences were from individual experiences only. For men, just over 50% of influences on remission were distinct from those on AUD, and the influence of environments shared with the co-twin were substantial.

    "abstract": "A higher frequency of twin births in sibships of Klinefelter syndrome patients and also monozygotic or dizygotic twins, themselves being affected by Klinefelter syndrome have been noted repeatedly. To address this issue, we evaluated type and frequency of twinning among Klinefelter fetuses that we had received for autopsy within a 'Prenatal Diagnosis' program.\nWe performed fetal autopsies, and genetic analyses on DNA extracted from stained histological slides.\nAmong 41 prenatal diagnoses of a 47, XXY karyotype we observed four twin pairs. One was dizygotic with discordant Klinefelter and Down syndrome. Three twin pairs were monozygotic as concluded from monochorial placentation. In two monozygotic pairs one twin partner was an acardiac monster and in one of these the acardiac twin showed a female gonadal sex and missing Y-chromosomal SRY-sequences as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction.\nThere is a high rate of twinning and twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence among our Klinefelter fetuses. Forked umbilical cords at the placental insertion site in one case allowed classification as conjoined twins in the sense of a 'funiculopagus'. Anaphase lagging or semidizygosity by second polar body twinning are proposed as explanations for the gonadal sex discordance and the excessive developmental disadvantage in the one acardiac. Problems may arise with regard to non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of aneuploidies in twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to examine the relative association of genetic and environmental factors with individual differences in each of the proximal, jointly necessary, and sufficient causes for suicidal behavior, according to the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS; Joiner, 2005). We examined data on derived scales measuring acquired capability, belongingness, and burdensomeness (the determinants of suicidal behavior, according to theory) from 348 adolescent male twins. Univariate biometrical models were used to estimate the magnitude of additive genetic (A), non-additive genetic (D), shared environmental (C), and non-shared environmental (E) effects associated with the variance in acquired capability, belongingness, and burdensomeness. The best fitting model for the acquired capability allowed for additive genetic and environmental effects, whereas the best fitting model for burdensomeness and belongingness allowed for shared and non-shared environmental effects. The present research extends prior work by specifying the environmental and genetic contributions to the components of the IPTS, and our findings suggest that belongingness and burdensomeness may be more appropriate targets for clinical intervention than acquired capability as these factors may be more malleable or amenable to change.",

We describe two cases of fatal discordant gestational Group B streptococcus infection in both a monochorionic/diamniotic pregnancy and in a dichorionic/diamniotic pregnancy. In both instances, cultures, examination of the placentae, and autopsy findings demonstrated infection by Group B streptococcus in only the presenting fetus. Despite the ubiquity of this organism, this is the first documented case of discordant gestational Group B streptococcus infection in monochorionic/diamniotic twins and only the third case documented in dichorionic/diamniotic twins.",

    "abstract": "We report on a pair of male monozygotic twins with 22q11.2 microdeletion, discordant phenotype and discordant deletion size. The second twin had findings suggestive of DiGeorge syndrome, while the first twin had milder anomalies without any cardiac malformation. The second twin had presented with intractable convulsion, cyanosis and cardiovascular failure in the fourth week of life and expired on the sixth week of life, whereas the first twin had some characteristic facial appearance with developmental delay but no other signs of the 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome including cardiovascular malformation. The fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis had shown a microdeletion on the chromosome 22q11.2 in both twins. The interphase FISH did not find any evidence for the mosaicism. The genomic DNA microarray analysis, using HumanCytoSNP-12 BeadChip (Illumina), was identical between the twins except different size of deletion of 22q11.2. The zygosity using HumanCytoSNP-12 BeadChip (Illumina) microarray analysis suggested monozygosity. This observation indicates that altered size of the deletion may be the underlying etiology for the discordance in phenotype in monozygotic twins. We think early post zygotic events (mitotic non-allelic homologous recombination) could have been played a role in the alteration of 22q11.2 deletion size and, thus phenotypic variability in the monozygotic twins.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of identical twins with lethal congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) type 0. Twin A expired several hours after birth, and twin B was sustained by extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support; however, care was withdrawn from twin B following the autopsy of twin A, which revealed a diagnosis of CPAM type 0. Both twins showed pulmonary hypoplasia, histologically consistent with CPAM type 0 and pulmonary hypertension. Furthermore, the family also had a previous male who presented with pulmonary hypoplasia and respiratory failure and died shortly after birth; however, no autopsy was performed to confirm a diagnosis of CPAM. Here, in discussing our case, as well as previously reported cases, we demonstrate CPAM type 0's high prevalence among females (9:1 ratio). From the reported cases, it appears that CPAM type 0's tendency to recur in families is up to 40%, suggesting an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. However, the actual tendency of familial recurrence is hard to assess due to the rarity of the disease and the potential lack of reporting CPAM type 0 cases. To our knowledge, our report represents the first description of CPAM type 0 in identical twins.",

    "abstract": "Many aspects of brain processing are intimately linked to brain rhythms. Essentially all classical brain rhythms, i.e., delta, theta, alpha, beta, and sleep waves, are highly heritable. This renders brain rhythms an interesting intermediate phenotype for cognitive and behavioral traits. One brain rhythm that has been particularly strongly linked to cognition is the gamma rhythm: it is involved in attention, short- and long-term memory, and conscious awareness. It has been described in sensory and motor cortices, association and control structures, and the hippocampus. In contrast to most other brain rhythms, the gamma frequency highly depends on stimulus and task conditions, suggesting a low heritability. However, the heritability of gamma has not been assessed. Here, we show that visually induced gamma-band synchronization in humans is strongly genetically determined. Eighty twin subjects (20 monozygotic and 20 dizygotic twin pairs) viewed a moving sinusoidal grating while their brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography. The stimulus induced spectrally confined gamma-band activity in sensors over visual cortex in all subjects, with individual peak frequencies ranging from 45 to 85 Hz. Gamma-band peak frequencies were highly correlated across monozygotic twins (r = 0.88), but not across dizygotic twins (r = 0.32) or unrelated subjects (r = 0.02). This implies a heritability of the gamma-band frequency of 91%. This strong genetic determination suggests that gamma-related cognitive functions are under close genetic control.",

A total of 42 pairs of twins (monozygotic twins-16 pairs, dizygotic like sex twins-20 pairs and dizygotic unlike sex twins-6 pairs) from the states of West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh of India were studied for this purpose. High discordance value in dizygotic twins in various types of bracelet creases is found to be sufficient to account for the high estimates of heritability. Estimated value of heritability (0.80), however, corroborates this finding. This is indicative of major role played by genetic factors in the expression of the trait as compared to environmental factors.",

We studied three Turkish Sj\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome patients with ichthyosis, developmental delay, spastic diplegia, and brain white matter disease. One patient was homozygous for a novel ALDH3A2 mutation in exon 5. The mutation involves the codon 228 (CGC) with the transversion G->A modifying the codon in CAC, leading to the substitution of the original arginine with a histidine (R228H), modifying the stereospecific properties of this region. These results add to the understanding of the genetic basis of Sj\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome and will be useful for DNA diagnosis of this disease.",

These episodes progressively ceased by the age of 36 months, replaced by paroxysmal episodes of alternating hemiplegia unrelated to water immersion. By age 4 years, the twins developed the classic features of alternating hemiplegia of childhood. Clinical outcomes at the age of 11 years are now reported. Standard and video-electroencephalograms showed a large, slow background activity followed by lower amplitude waves without focal abnormalities or other abnormal findings. This represents the first report on (a) alternating hemiplegia of childhood started with bath-induced paroxysmal episodes; (b) this condition in monozygotic twins; and (c) an 11-year follow-up study in which the twins continue to experience episodes of alternating hemiplegia in the setting of baseline cognitive impairment without epileptic episodes.",

The understanding sparked by these discoveries has inspired and informed the engineering of novel RNA structures, control elements, and genetic circuits in cells. Many of these engineered systems are built up fundamentally from RNA-RNA interactions, often combining modular, rational design with functional selection and screening. It is therefore useful to review the particular class of RNA-based regulatory mechanisms that rely on RNA self-assembly either through homomeric (self-self) or heteromeric (self-nonself) RNA-RNA interactions. Structures and sequence elements within individual RNAs create a basis for the pairing interactions, and in some instances can even lead to the formation of RNA polymers. Example systems of dimers, multimers, and polymers are reviewed in this article in the context of natural systems, wherein the function and impact of self-assemblies are understood. Following this, a brief overview is presented of specific engineered RNA self-assembly systems implemented ",

    "abstract": "To study intersibling variability of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in twins and determine its risk factors. A retrospective chart review of twin neonates developing ROP at a tertiary center over a 5 year period (January 2004 to December 2008). Twin pairs with intersibling variability of ROP were retrieved based on one of the following criterion: (1) two-stage difference in ROP between siblings, (2) one sibling with treatable ROP and the other with spontaneously regressed ROP, or (3) one sibling with aggressive posterior ROP and the other with staged ROP. Babies with greater severity of ROP were included in group A (case group) and their siblings with less severity in group B (control group).The two groups were compared for birth weight, birth order and putative post-gestational risk factors. Thirty-five twin pairs developed ROP of which 28 pairs (80%) had severe intersibling variability. Twenty-one pairs with complete information about risk factors were analyzed. The birth weight of the case group was 1212.1 \u00b1 248.3 g (mean \u00b1 SD) and control group 1172.1 \u00b1 216.5 g (mean \u00b1 SD) (p = 0.33). In twelve of the 21 pairs the second born twin had more severe ROP. However, birth order was not a significant predictor (p = 0.664). Various post-gestational risk factors did not differ significantly between the two groups [oxygen administration (p = 1), sepsis (p = 0.625), exchange transfusion (p = 1), blood transfusion (p = 0.325), respiratory distress syndrome (p = 1), anemia (p = 0.125), apnea (0.375), neonatal jaundice (p = 1), patent ductus arteriosus (p = 0.5) and hypoglycemia (p = 1)]. The majority of the twins developing ROP had severe intersibling variability. Birth weight, birth order and post-gestational neonatal risk factor were not predictive of more severe ROP in a twin sibling.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic twins are considered to be genetically identical, yet can show high discordance in their phenotypes and disease susceptibility. Several studies have emphasized the influence of external factors and the role of epigenetic polymorphism in conferring this variability. However, some recent high-resolution studies on DNA methylation show contradicting evidence, which poses questions on the extent of epigenetic variability between twins. The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies now allow us to interrogate multiple epigenomes on a massive scale and understand the role of epigenetic modification, especially DNA methylation, in regulating complex traits. This article briefly discusses the recent key findings, unsolved questions in the area, and speculates on the future directions in the field.",

Our outcome measures were mean grade points on a five point scale from ninth grade of primary school at 15-16 years, IQ tests on a nine grade point scale from male conscripts at 18-19 years, highest completed education, disability benefits, work income and employment at 27-35 years of age.\nTwins had slightly better mean grade point averages in ninth grade; +0.08 (95% CI 0.04-0.11) and more often had completed a university education in young adulthood; OR 1.16 (1.02-1.21) compared with singleton siblings, despite male twins having a slightly lower IQ at military conscription compared with male singletons. Employment rates, mean income and disability benefits were similar in twins and singletons.\nTwins have slightly better educational careers and similar vocational careers compared with those born as singletons.",

    "abstract": "Twin gestations are fascinating and are also high-risk pregnancies. They account for approximately 3% of all pregnancies in the United States. Major obstetrical complications associated with twin pregnancies include hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, and preterm delivery. In addition, the death rate for twins and the rate of severe handicap in very low birth weight survivors of twin pregnancies is greater than that for singleton pregnancies. Ultrasound allows for stepwise evaluations at any time during a twin gestation. Current evidence suggests that uncomplicated diamniotic twins with concordant and appropriate growth beyond 24 weeks' gestation should be managed conservatively and the time and mode of delivery should be determined on the basis of obstetrical history and fetal presentations. Perinatal management of the remaining twin pregnancies depends on good clinical judgment, which is improved by the use of ultrasound imaging.",

    "abstract": "Previously the stabilization of coronary plaque with atorvastatin was demonstrated in the TWINS (evaluaTion With simultaneous angIoscopy and iNtravascular ultraSound) study. The influence of the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level on plaque stabilization was analyzed.\nPatients (n=29) with hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease (CAD) were analyzed. They received atorvastatin (10-20mg/day) for 80 weeks and were divided into low (< 91 mg/dl) and high (\u2265 91 mg/dl) LDL-C groups based on their 80-week LDL-C level. Angioscopy was performed before and after treatment. Yellow coronary plaques were classified into six grades (grades 0 to 5) and mean grade was determined for each patient. The LDL-C levels at week 28 and 80 were reduced in both low LDL-C groups (n=14, 140.3 to 77.9 and 75.9 mg/dl; P<0.001 both groups) and high LDL-C groups (n=15, 151.7 to 93.0 and 99.1mg/dl; P<0.001 both groups). Significant improvement in the mean grade was shown in the low LDL-C groups (1.44 to 1.00 and 1.05; P=0.003 both groups) at week 28 and 80 vs. no significant change in high LDL-C groups (1.43 to 1.23 and 1.28; P=0.032 and P=0.169 respectively).\nAdequate reduction of LDL-C is important for the stabilization of coronary plaques.",

    "abstract": "Structural brain abnormalities are consistently found in schizophrenia (Sz) and have been associated with the familial risk for the disorder. We aim to define the relative contributions of genetic and nongenetic factors to the association between structural brain abnormalities and Sz in a uniquely powered cohort (Schizophrenia Twins and Relatives consortium).\nAn international multicenter magnetic resonance imaging collaboration was set up to pool magnetic resonance imaging scans from twin pairs in Utrecht (The Netherlands), Helsinki (Finland), London (United Kingdom), and Jena (Germany). A sample of 684 subjects took part, consisting of monozygotic twins (n = 410, with 51 patients from concordant and 52 from discordant pairs) and dizygotic twins (n = 274, with 39 patients from discordant pairs). The additive genetic, common, and unique environmental contributions to the association between brain volumes and risk for Sz were estimated by structural equation modeling.\nThe heritabilities of most brain volumes were significant and ranged between 52% (temporal cortical gray matter) and 76% (cerebrum). Heritability of cerebral gray matter did not reach significance (34%). Significant phenotypic correlations were found between Sz and reduced volumes of the cerebrum (-.22 [-.30/-.14]) and white matter (-.17 [-.25/-.09]) and increased volume of the third ventricle (.18 [.08/.28]). These were predominantly due to overlapping genetic effects (77%, 94%, and 83%, respectively).\nSome of the genes that transmit the risk for Sz also influence cerebral (white matter) volume.",

    "abstract": "Several data suggest that stochastic rearrangements of the TCR could play a pathogenic role in both disease predisposition and protection in type 1 diabetes (T1D). As twin sets offer an enormous potential in evaluating the role of genetic and environmental factors in susceptibility to disease, the main goal of this study was to assess whether the degree of sharing of the expressed TCR repertoire of twin pairs discordant for T1D differs from that of disease concordant pairs. We performed our analysis in 5 pairs of monozygotic twins, 3 of which were concordant and 2 discordant for T1D, by combining flow cytometry and CDR3 spectratyping on both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Our data show that TCR repertoires show increased level of concordance within each twin pair, especially in CD8+ cells, in terms of mean BV expression levels on flow cytometry as well as of CDR3 patterns and frequencies of skewed or oligoclonal BV subfamilies on spectratyping. It is worth noting that the degree of similarity among twins seems to be independent of concordance or discordance for T1D. Our findings seem to suggest that in monozygotic twins with T1D the TCR repertoire is influenced by genetic factors more than by the presence of the autoimmune disorder itself.",

Our cases demonstrate different clinical presentations of the same disease and add to literature the peculiarity of the early onset, the recurrence of episodes of enterocolitis associated with increasing systemic eosinophilia and episodes clinically and radiologically mimicking NEC.",

Propylthiouracil (PTU; 200 mg daily) was prescribed to her and four weekly follow ups by the endocrinologist and obstetrician were ensured.

The lady normally delivered heterozygotic twins. Umbilical cord blood of the baby boy twin showed a\u00a0high TSH (541 \u00b5U/ml; reference range 0.270 - 4.20 \u03bcU/ml). He was started on thyroxine therapy (50 \u00b5g once daily). Ultrasound reported the absence of the thyroid gland. One month later TSH was within normal range and thyroxine dose was adjusted to 25 \u00b5g once daily. Repeated ultrasound confirmed the absence of thyroid gland. TSH was repeatedly normal. The boy is currently doing well on thyroxine replacement therapy. The other non-identical twin was a\u00a0healthy girl with normal thyroid function tests and always thereafter. This case report suggested that PTU could be a\u00a0hazardous drug to the fetus, since the mother gave birth to a\u00a0baby with thyroid aplasia.\nPTU, Thyroid aplasia, Thyrotoxicosis, TSH.",

    "abstract": "Epicardial fat with its close proximity to coronary arteries has been suggested to be a significant predictor of cardiovascular disease. We studied the relations among acquired obesity, low-grade inflammation, and genetic factors in the accumulation of epicardial fat. A rare sample (n = 15) of healthy monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for obesity (intrapair difference in body mass index \u22653 kg/m(2)) and 9 concordant MZ pairs 23 to 33 years old were examined for cardiac structure, function, epicardial fat thickness (echocardiography), abdominal subcutaneous tissue, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT), liver fat (magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy), and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. In the entire sample, MZ cotwins were remarkably similar in most echocardiographic measurements including epicardial fat (intraclass correlation 0.63, p = 0.0004). However, in the discordant pairs, the obese cotwins (16.5 kg, 23% heavier) had 26% more epicardial fat (p = 0.0029) than nonobese cotwins. They also had significantly larger atrial and left ventricular dimensions. Epicardial fat correlated with VAT (r = 0.49, p = 0.02) in individual twins and when using intrapair differences of measurements within pairs (r = 0.39, p = 0.06). In multiple regression analyses including abdominal subcutaneous tissue, VAT, and liver fat, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was the only factor that remained significantly associated with epicardial fat in individual twins and within pairs. In conclusion, subjects who share the same genes seem to have similar cardiac dimensions. However, acquired obesity increases epicardial fat independent of genetic factors. The close relation between epicardial fat and low-grade inflammation is likely to contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease in obesity.",

    "abstract": "Clinical studies suggest metabolic memory to hyperglycemia. We tested whether diabetes leads to persistent systematic in vitro gene expression alterations in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) compared with their monozygotic, nondiabetic twins. Microarray gene expression was determined in skin fibroblasts (SFs) of five twin pairs cultured in high glucose (HG) for \u223c6 weeks. The Exploratory Visual Analysis System tested group differences in gene expression levels within KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways. An overabundance of differentially expressed genes was found in eight pathways: arachidonic acid metabolism (P = 0.003849), transforming growth factor-\u03b2 signaling (P = 0.009167), glutathione metabolism (P = 0.01281), glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (P = 0.01949), adherens junction (P = 0.03134), dorsal-ventral axis formation (P = 0.03695), proteasome (P = 0.04327), and complement and coagulation cascade (P = 0.04666). Several genes involved in epigenetic mechanisms were also differentially expressed. All differentially expressed pathways and all the epigenetically relevant differentially expressed genes have previously been related to HG in vitro or to diabetes and its complications in animal and human studies. However, this is the first in vitro study demonstrating diabetes-relevant gene expression differences between T1D-discordant identical twins. These SF gene expression differences, persistent despite the HG in vitro conditions, likely reflect \"metabolic memory\", and discordant identical twins thus represent an excellent model for studying diabetic epigenetic processes in humans.",

    "abstract": "Theory and research suggest that maladaptive perfectionism, specifically, concerns about mistakes (CM) and doubts about actions (DA), may be important etiologic and maintenance mechanisms for anxiety and its disorders. However, no studies speaking directly to the origins of the relationship, i.e. what etiologic factors underlie the phenotypic association between anxiety and maladaptive perfectionism, exist. The current study aimed to address this gap in the literature by exploring genetic and environmental relationships between anxiety symptoms and maladaptive perfectionism.\nThe sample consisted of 292 young adult same-sex female twins from the Michigan State University Twin Registry. Anxiety symptoms were assessed by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait version and an anxiety problems scale derived from the Young Adult Self Report. Maladaptive perfectionism was measured using the CM and DA subscales of the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale.\nAnxiety and maladaptive perfectionism were both moderately heritable, with estimates ranging from. 45 to .66. Moreover, multivariate analyses revealed that genetic factors were primarily responsible for associations between anxiety and maladaptive perfectionism (r(g) =.59-.88).\nThis is the first study to demonstrate the role of genetic factors in the relationship between anxiety and maladaptive perfectionism. Future studies are needed to uncover the specific biologic and genetic factors that contribute to this relationship and to evaluate whether maladaptive perfectionism represents an intermediate trait or risk factor for anxiety.",

A delay in diagnosis occurred in both cases, despite prenatal ultrasound abnormalities.

    "abstract": "Monochorionic (MC) pregnancies are routinely delivered electively at late preterm gestation with the aim of avoiding stillbirth at term. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prospective risk of late stillbirth in a large regional cohort of twin pregnancies of known chorionicity.\nThis was a retrospective study of all twin pregnancy births of known chorionicity between 2000 and 2009 from a large regional cohort consisting of nine hospitals. Prospective risk was calculated per 1000 fetuses rather than pregnancies, as each twin pregnancy had two gestations at risk of stillbirth.\nA total of 3005 twin pregnancies delivered after 26 weeks' gestation in the Southwest Thames Obstetric Research Collaborative. The total risk of stillbirth after 26 weeks in MC twins (19.1 per 1000 fetuses) was significantly higher than in dichorionic (DC) twins (6.5 per 1000 fetuses), with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.97 (95% CI, 1.71-5.18). The risk of stillbirth in MC twins did not change significantly between 26 weeks (1.8 per 1000 fetuses) and 36 weeks (3.4 per 1000 fetuses), with an OR of 1.85 (95% CI, 0.3-13.2). The equivalent figures for DC twins were 0.6 per 1000 fetuses and 2.1 per 1000 fetuses, respectively (OR, 3.4 (95% CI, 0.9-13.2)).\nThe risk of stillbirth in MC twins does not appear to increase significantly near term. This may be due to a policy of routine surveillance and elective delivery from 36 weeks. The data do not support a policy of elective delivery before 36 weeks' gestation in MC pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "\"Executive functions\" (EF) is a multidimensional construct which encompasses many higher-order cognitive control operations, and is considered a potential mediator of age-associated changes in other cognitive domains. Here we examine the heritability of four measures of EF, and the genetic influences on their covariation with general cognitive abilities (GCA) from the Older Australian Twins Study. Participants included 117 pairs of monozygotic twins, 98 pairs of dizygotic twins, and 42 single twins, with a mean age of 71. Genetic modeling showed that additive genetic factors contributed to 59, 63,29, and 31% of the variance in the four measures: working memory, verbal fluency, response inhibition and cognitive flexibility, respectively. The phenotypic associations among the four EF measures were modest, which is in line with other evidence that EF is a multi-dimensional construct.All of the covariation between the EF measures was attributable to a common genetic factor. Similarly, all of the covariation between EF and General Cognitive Ability was explained by a common genetic factor, with no significant covariance due to environmental (E) factors. The genetic correlations between the measures were moderately high, suggesting that they may have common biological underpinnings. The genetic influence in the covariation of the EF measures and GCA also suggests that some aspects of EF and GCA share the same genes or same set of genes.",

Furthermore, a solvent-controlled fabrication of polyhedral copper sulfides (Cu(7)S(4) and CuS) with different stoichiometries and microstructures can be artificially achieved, which is determined by the intrinsic difference of the surface states of Cu(2)O templates. Structural and morphological evolutions were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Stoichiometric-dependent characteristics were demonstrated in the UV-vis absorption investigations. The as-prepared Cu(7)S(4) microcages exhibit higher photocatalytic activity for enhancing degradation of methylene blue, which might be attributed to their special nanotwinned building blocks. This study is of great importance in \"bottom-up\" assembly of unusual ordering hollow copper sulfides superstructures, but also offers a good opportunity to understand the fundamental significance of nanotwinned structures for their potential applications.",

    "abstract": "Monozygotic (MZ) twins do not show complete concordance for many complex diseases; for example, discordance rates for autoimmune diseases are 20%-80%. MZ discordance indicates a role for epigenetic or environmental factors in disease. We used MZ twins discordant for psoriasis to search for genome-wide differences in DNA methylation and gene expression in CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells using Illumina's HumanMethylation27 and HT-12 expression assays, respectively. Analysis of these data revealed no differentially methylated or expressed genes between co-twins when analyzed separately, although we observed a substantial amount of small differences. However, combined analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression identified genes where differences in DNA methylation between unaffected and affected twins were correlated with differences in gene expression. Several of the top-ranked genes according to significance of the correlation in CD4(+) cells are known to be associated with psoriasis. Further, gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed enrichment of biological processes associated with the immune response and clustering of genes in a biological pathway comprising cytokines and chemokines. These data suggest that DNA methylation is involved in an epigenetic dysregulation of biological pathways involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. This is the first study based on data from MZ twins discordant for psoriasis to detect epigenetic alterations that potentially contribute to development of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Although early trauma (trauma in childhood) has been linked to adult inflammation and adult disease of inflammatory origin, it remains unknown whether this relationship is due to long-term consequences of early life stress or other familial factors.\nWe examined 482 male middle-aged twins (241 pairs) born between 1946 and 1956 from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Childhood traumatic experiences, before the age of 18 years, were measured retrospectively with the Early Trauma Inventory and included physical, sexual, emotional abuse and general trauma. Lifetime major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease were also assessed. Plasma C-reactive protein and interleukin 6 were measured to determine levels of inflammation. Mixed-effects regression models with a random intercept for pair were used to separate between- and within-twin pair effects.\nWhen twins were analyzed as individuals, increasing levels of early trauma were positively related to C-reactive protein (p = .03) but not to interleukin 6 (p = .12). When estimating within- and between-pair effects, only the between-pair association of early trauma with the inflammatory markers remained significant.\nThe link between early trauma and inflammation is largely explained by familial factors shared by the twins because levels of inflammation were highest when both twins were exposed to trauma. Exposure to early trauma may be a marker for an unhealthy familial environment. Clarification of familial factors associated with early stress and adult inflammation will be important to uncover correlates of stress and disease.",

The relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to individual differences in CR was estimated by applying an independent pathway model to the twin data and AST by intraclass correlations (ICC).\nFor the right eye, mean CR was 44.58 dioptres (D) (standard deviation (SD) \u00b11.28) When comparing CR of the right and left eye between MZ and DZ, no significant difference was found. Mean AST was 0.77 D (SD \u00b10.44) with no differences observed either between the MZ and the DZ individuals, or between the left and the right eyes. ICCs between the sisters for CR were, for the right eye, 0.882 and 0.378 for MZ and DZ, respectively, and for the left eye 0.855 and 0.358. For AST of the right eye, the ICCs were 0.533 and 0.096 for the MZ and DZ pairs, respectively, and for the left eye, the MZ and DZ correlations were 0.396 and 0.299. Quantitative genetic modelling showed that 81% of the variance in CR could be explained by genetic factors, additive genetic factors explaining 62% (95% confidence interval [CI] 44% -86%) and dominant genetic effect 19% (95% CI 7-49%) of the variance in CR. Different models were constructed to explain the heredity of AST. None of these models gave meaningful results, although the ICC values for MZ were higher than those for DZ.\nMost of the variance in CR among older Finnish women could be explained by genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "The relative impact of genetic and social influences on disordered eating behaviors (DEB) including binging, purging, excessive dieting and negative self-evaluations about weight remain an issue of debate. The current study sought to examine the relative influence of genetic and social influences on DEB. A 7-year prospective analysis of 580 monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins was conducted. Estimates of heritability of DEB were obtained using the DF Analysis Model. Regression equations revealed the relative predictive value of sibling's DEB, neurotic personality, maternal warmth and television and video game exposure on DEB. Heritability estimates for DEB were 0.40 for females and 0.48 for males. Among MZ and DZ twin pairs, female sex, neurotic personality and a genetic variable component, but not maternal warmth or school related problems, predicted DEB. Contrary to the expectations of media effects theory, greater media use was associated with lower DEB among DZ twins and had no influence on MZ twins. These results indicate that DEB is highly heritable and that personality variables may play an important role in the formation of DEB. This suggests that it is important to control for genetic variables when analyzing risk factors for DEB.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify the anatomic and pathologic structural cardiac abnormalities in conjoined twins and to focus on those that have prevented the successful separation of conjoined hearts. A retrospective review was undertaken to examine consecutive cases of thoracopagus conjoined twins with conjoined hearts evaluated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from 1 January 1980 through 6 October 2008. The records included autopsy and surgical findings as well as clinical reports. The study group included nine sets of conjoined twins with a mean gestational age at birth of 33.8 \u00b1 5.5 weeks. Three twin pairs were stillborn. Five twin pairs died afterward. One pair died of cardiopulmonary failure. The median age at death was 22 days (range, 0-345 days). Major congenital heart disease was present in 94.4% (17/18) of the hearts, and 72.2% (13/18) of the hearts had single-ventricle physiology. Total anomalous pulmonary venous return occurred in 39% (7/18) of the cases. The clinical outcome for thoracopagus twins with conjoined hearts remains poor because of inability to separate conjoined and single ventricles. Surgical nonintervention and palliative care should be strongly considered for these patients.",

We hypothesized that increased sodium consumption is associated with lower CFR.\nHabitual daily sodium intake for the previous 12 mo was measured in 286 male middle-aged twins (133 monozygotic and dizygotic pairs and 20 unpaired twins) by using the Willett food-frequency questionnaire. CFR was measured by positron emission tomography [N(13)]-ammonia, with quantitation of myocardial blood flow at rest and after adenosine stress. Mixed-effects regression analysis was used to assess the association between dietary sodium and CFR.\nAn increase in dietary sodium of 1000 mg/d was associated with a 10.0% lower CFR (95% CI: -17.0%, -2.5%) after adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, nutritional, and CVD risk factors (P = 0.01). Across quintiles of sodium consumption, dietary sodium was inversely associated with CFR (P-trend = 0.03), with the top quintile (>1456 mg/d) having a 20% lower CFR than the bottom quintile (<732 mg /d). This association also persisted within pairs: a 1000-mg/d difference in dietary sodium between brothers was associated with a 10.3% difference in CFR after adjustment for potential confounders (P = 0.02).\nHabitual dietary sodium is inversely associated with CFR independent of CVD risk factors and shared familial and genetic factors. Our study suggests a potential novel mechanism for the adverse effects of dietary sodium on the cardiovascular system. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00017836.",

    "abstract": "During past decades, twin studies have played an important role in genetic epidemiology studies of complex traits. The strength of twin studies lies in the ability to disentangle genetic and environmental factors that contribute to a phenotype, by comparing genetically identical monozygotic twins to dizygotic twins, who share on average 50% of genetic variants. Twin studies now offer the opportunity to study epigenetic variation across the genome with two aims. First, twin studies can improve our understanding of the factors regulating epigenetic variability by assessing the heritability of epigenetic variants. Secondly, the use of twins in epigenetic research is increasingly recognized as an important approach to help unravel the complexities associated with human development and disease. The strategic use of identical twins discordant for complex disease has revealed the importance of linking epigenetic disruption to the disease-associated risk in humans. Lastly, we also discuss the possibility that epigenetic effects on disease may in part explain some of the missing heritability in genome-wide association studies. The study of human epigenetic factors in twins can inform the role of genetics, as well as in utero and postnatal environments to the establishment, maintenance and functional consequences of human epigenome variation.",

Two gestational sacs and fetuses with heartbeats showing lambda sign under ultrasonography were recognized at 7 weeks of gestation and the patient gave birth to two female infants at gestational 33 weeks. The pathological examination demonstrated that the DD twin placentas fused in the third trimester.\nThis report suggests that the splitting of the transferred embryo took place after the blastocyst stage and the popular credo that the timing of embryo division governs the placental configuration of monozygotic twins (MZT) must be re-examined as to its veracity.",

    "abstract": "It is the common lore to assume that knowing the equation for the probability distribution function (PDF) of a stochastic model as a function of time tells the whole picture defining all other characteristics of the model. We show that this is not the case by comparing two exactly solvable models of anomalous diffusion due to geometric constraints: the comb model and the random walk on a random walk. We show that though the two models have exactly the same PDFs, they differ in other respects, like their first passage time distributions, their autocorrelation functions, and their aging properties.",

    "abstract": "The pericentromeric region of chromosome 16p is rich in segmental duplications that predispose to rearrangements through non-allelic homologous recombination. Several recurrent copy number variations have been described recently in chromosome 16p. 16p11.2 rearrangements (29.5-30.1 Mb) are associated with autism, intellectual disability (ID) and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Another recognizable but less common microdeletion syndrome in 16p11.2p12.2 (21.4 to 28.5-30.1 Mb) has been described in six individuals with ID, whereas apparently reciprocal duplications, studied by standard cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques, have been reported in three patients with autism spectrum disorders. Here, we report a multiplex family with three boys affected with autism, including two monozygotic twins carrying a de novo 16p11.2p12.2 duplication of 8.95 Mb (21.28-30.23 Mb) characterized by single-nucleotide polymorphism array, encompassing both the 16p11.2 and 16p11.2p12.2 regions. The twins exhibited autism, severe ID, and dysmorphic features, including a triangular face, deep-set eyes, large and prominent nasal bridge, and tall, slender build. The eldest brother presented with autism, mild ID, early-onset obesity and normal craniofacial features, and carried a smaller, overlapping 16p11.2 microdeletion of 847 kb (28.40-29.25 Mb), inherited from his apparently healthy father. Recurrent deletions in this region encompassing the SH2B1 gene were recently reported in early-onset obesity and in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders associated with phenotypic variability. We discuss the clinical and genetic implications of two different 16p chromosomal rearrangements in this family, and suggest that the 16p11.2 deletion in the father predisposed to the formation of the duplication in his twin children.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of spontaneous familial pneumothorax in fraternal twin boys. The twins' family history is remarkable for reactive airway disease and a female sibling also born with spontaneous pneumothorax. The family had no history of connective tissue disorders, renal cancer, or dermatologic diseases. Analysis of the twins' \u03b1(1)-antitrypsin (AAT) genotype, phenotype, and serum concentration revealed that both were compound heterozygous for rare SERPINA1 alleles. These findings suggest a role for AAT deficiency in spontaneous pneumothorax of the newborn. To our knowledge, these are the first genetic data to support etiology of neonatal spontaneous familial pneumothorax.",

    "abstract": "Variation in response styles in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are known to be predictors of short- and long-term health outcomes. The nature of HPA responses to stressors changes with developmental stage, and some components of the stress response exhibit long-term individual consistency (i.e., are trait-like) while others are transient or variable (i.e., state-like). Here we evaluated the response of marmoset monkeys (Callithrix geoffroyi) to a standardized social stressor (social separation and exposure to a novel environment) at three different stages of development: juvenile, subadult, and young adult. We monitored levels of urinary cortisol (CORT), and derived multiple measures of HPA activity: Baseline CORT, CORT reactivity, CORT Area Under the Curve (AUC), and CORT regulation. Juvenile marmosets exhibited the most dramatic stress response, had higher AUCs, and tended to show poorer regulation. While baseline CORT and CORT regulation were not consistent within an individual across age, CORT reactivity and measures of AUC were highly correlated across time; i.e., individuals with high stress reactivity and AUC as juveniles also had high measures as subadults and adults, and vice-versa. Marmoset co-twins did not exhibit similar patterns of stress reactivity. These data suggest that regardless of the source of variation in stress response styles in marmosets, individually-distinctive patterns are established by six months of age, and persist for at least a year throughout different phases of marmoset life history.",

The clinical pathology of this complex entity is reviewed and placed in perspective. Confusion surrounds the severity of craniopagus conjoined twins especially in relation to the difficulty of separation and subsequent outcome. Successful separation of craniopagus twins remains a rarity, however modern neurosurgical tech- niques have created opportunities for successful sepa- ration and brought hope for a normal survival of these children who in the past were often left as historical footnotes or put on display as oddities of nature.

This will be examined in detail in this article. More specifically, we speak about model building, which has characterized General Didactics and Instructional Design for some decades. However, the models of General Didactics and Instructional Design are not problem-free with regard to the continuity and advancement of both disciplines. First, we will describe the historical roots of both disciplines and examine which elements of theory are of central importance. Second, we will try to answer the question of which kind of model building could be considered as predominant and what problems result from this predominance. In order to do this, we will describe empirical studies on the use of instructional models and discuss these studies from the perspective of the philosophy of science. Third, we will draw inferences for future processes of model building in order to prevent the same problems that happened in the past from happening again. Finally, we will discuss the issue of what General Didactics can learn from Instructional Design and vice versa.",

    "abstract": "We describe monozygotic twins discordant for childhood leukemia and secondary thyroid carcinoma. We used bisulfite pyrosequencing to compare the constitutive promoter methylation of BRCA1 and several other tumor suppressor genes in primary fibroblasts. The affected twin displayed an increased BRCA1 methylation (12%), compared with her sister (3%). Subsequent bisulfite plasmid sequencing demonstrated that 13% (6 of 47) BRCA1 alleles were fully methylated in the affected twin, whereas her sister displayed only single CpG errors without functional implications. This between-twin methylation difference was also found in irradiated fibroblasts and untreated saliva cells. The BRCA1 epimutation may have originated by an early somatic event in the affected twin: approximately 25% of her body cells derived from different embryonic cell lineages carry one epigenetically inactivated BRCA1 allele. This epimutation was associated with reduced basal protein levels and a higher induction of BRCA1 after DNA damage. In addition, we performed a genome-wide microarray analysis of both sisters and found several copy number variations, i.e., heterozygous deletion and reduced expression of the RSPO3 gene in the affected twin. This monozygotic twin pair represents an impressive example of epigenetic somatic mosaicism, suggesting a role for constitutive epimutations, maybe along with de novo genetic alterations in recurrent tumor development.",

Placental sharing, angioarchitecture and diameter of the arterio-arterial (AA) anastomosis were assessed by placental injection with colored dye.\nThe rate of velamentous cord insertion in MC placentas with and without BWD was 30% (28/94) and 16% (15/94), respectively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036). Placental sharing discordance in MC placentas with and without BWD was 36% and 17%, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

    "abstract": "Despite the known influence of early treatment on the facial appearance of growing patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion, few comparative reports on the long-term effects of different treatment regimens (1-phase vs 2-phase treatment) have been published. Uncertainty remains regarding the effects of early intervention on jaw growth and its effectiveness and efficiency in the long term. In this case report, we compared the effects of early orthodontic intervention as the first phase of a 2-phase treatment vs 1-phase fixed appliance treatment in identical twins over a period of 11 years. Facial and dental changes were recorded, and cephalometric superimpositions were made at 4 time points. In spite of the different treatment approaches, both patients showed identical dentofacial characteristics in the retention phase. Through this case report, we intended to clarify the benefits of undergoing 1-phase treatment against 2-phase treatment protocols for treating growing skeletal Class III patients.",

    "abstract": "Extant twin research on the depression-smoking association in adolescents has been conducted in U.S. and European samples and considered depression as a unitary phenotype. This study explored genetic and environmental influences on covariation between smoking initiation and 4 depressive symptom dimensions (positive affect [PA], negative affect [NA], somatic features [SF], and interpersonal problems [IP]) in adolescent Chinese twins.\nQuestionnaires measuring current depressive symptoms and lifetime smoking initiation were administered to 602 twin pairs (M [SD] age = 12.2 (1.93) years, range 9-16 years). Cholesky bivariate decomposition models examined influences on each depressive symptom dimension, smoking initiation, and their covariation using age- and sex-adjusted threshold variables.\nWithin-twin correlations between smoking initiation and each depressive symptom dimension were significant (|r|s = .29-.61). Bivariate twin modeling showed significant genetic effects on overall depressive symptoms (55% variance), shared environment effects on NA (36%) and PA (53%), and shared environment effects on smoking initiation (46%) unique from PA. No other familial influences on the individual phenotypes (apart from those accounting for smoking-depression covariance) were significant. Relations of smoking initiation to overall depressive symptoms and IP were influenced by familial (shared environment and/or genetic) factors and nonshared environmental factors. The SF-smoking initiation relation was influenced mostly by familial factors. Only shared environment significantly influenced the association of lower PA and higher NA to smoking initiation.\nRelations between each symptom dimension and smoking initiation are of sizeable magnitude in Chinese adolescents. Genetic and environmental factors underlying depression-smoking comorbidity may vary across different depressive symptom dimensions.",

The SF-smoking initiation relation was influenced mostly by familial factors. Only shared environment significantly influenced the association of lower PA and higher NA to smoking initiation.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis and management of conjoined twins are constantly evolving. New imaging techniques provide important anatomic details and help in planning the separation procedure. Despite these technological advances, however, the complex arrangement of conjoined organs is somewhat difficult to interpret, leaving unresolved questions at time of surgery. The authors present a video demonstrating laparoscopy as an adjunct in the preoperative planning of separation of ischiopagus tripus conjoined twins as well as illustrating the complex anatomy in a combination of video, drawings, and radiologic imaging. To date, this is the first time that laparoscopy has been used in preoperative assessment of conjoined twins.\nAfter elective cesarean delivery, ischiopagus tripus conjoined twins were thoroughly evaluated with conventional imaging, including plain radiographs and computed tomography scan with three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction images. The anatomy of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts was further defined with barium enema, retrograde pyelography, and cystoscopy. In addition to these tests, diagnostic laparoscopy was performed at time of tissue expander placement. An angled scope, introduced through a 5-mm umbilical port, was used to visualize the intraperitoneal organs as well as all accessible retroperitoneal structures.\nLaparoscopy provided useful information regarding the bowel distribution between the twins. In addition, it helped demonstrate the relationship of shared solid organs with other intra-abdominal structures and identify anatomic landmarks used in the subsequent separation of the twins. Finally, laparoscopy helped confirm the presence, number, and morphology of the internal female genitalia.\nDiagnostic laparoscopy is a useful tool in evaluation of ischiopagus tripus conjoined twins. It is an important adjunct to preoperative studies in preparing for an expeditious and safe separation procedure.",

    "abstract": "Although differences in size of the right and left thyroid lobes are well defined, differences in morphology, follicles structure, cAMP production, thyrotropin receptor, and protein involved in cell signalling have not previously been reported. This study provides morpho-functional data of right and left thyroid lobes by biochemical, immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis. We demonstrate that, in comparison with the left lobe, the right lobe has a higher activation index, is more sensitive to thyrotropin treatment, is rich in thyrotropin receptor and caveolin 1 involved in thyroid hormone synthesis as well as in epithelial thyroid cell homeostasis, is characterised by a high content of molecules involved in cell signalling such as stat3, raf1, sphingomyelinase and sphingomyelin-synthase whose activity ratio is necessary for epithelial cell activity and finally has more areas calcitonin-dependent. The relation between structure/function of right lobe and its susceptibility to the higher risk of pathological modifications with respect the left lobe is discussed.",

Genetic risk of drug use based on family history, higher sensation seeking, and peer group deviance predicted both alcohol and cannabis initiation. Higher drug availability predicted cannabis initiation while less parental monitoring and drug availability were the best predictors of how much cannabis individuals consumed over time.\nThe liability to initiate alcohol and cannabis, average drug use as well as changes in drug use during teenage years and young adulthood is associated with known risk factors.",

Intracardiac KCl (1-2 ml; 15 mEq/ml) under ultrasonographic guidance was used in all procedures. Congenital defect, gestational age at the procedure, incidence and perinatal outcome were retrieved.\nSelective termination was performed in 14 (50%) cases of structural defects with normal karyotype and in 14 (50%) cases of chromosomal abnormality, 13 of them (92.8%) trisomy 21. Median gestational age at the procedure was 17.8 weeks (range 14.5-24; SD 2.3), and 12 (42.8%) were performed before 18 weeks. The presenting fetus was terminated in 11 cases (39.3%). Selective termination was followed by the subsequent delivery of a viable infant in 27 out of 28 cases (96.4%). Fetal loss before 24 weeks occurred in 1 case (3.6%).

    "abstract": "In a sample of 3,187 twins and 3,294 of their parents, we sought to investigate association of both individual variants and a genotype-based height score involving 176 of the 180 common genetic variants with adult height identified recently by the GIANT consortium. First, longitudinal observations on height spanning pre-adolescence through adulthood in the twin sample allowed us to investigate the separate effects of the previously identified SNPs on pre-pubertal height and pubertal growth spurt. We show that the effect of SNPs identified by the GIANT consortium is primarily on prepubertal height. Only one SNP, rs7759938 in LIN28B, approached a significant association with pubertal growth. Second, we show how using the twin data to control statistically for environmental variance can provide insight into the ultimate magnitude of SNP effects and consequently the genetic architecture of a phenotype. Specifically, we computed a genetic score by weighting SNPs according to their effects as assessed via meta-analysis. This weighted score accounted for 9.2% of the phenotypic variance in height, but 14.3% of the corresponding genetic variance. Longitudinal samples will be needed to understand the developmental context of common genetic variants identified through GWAS, while genetically informative designs will be helpful in accurately characterizing the extent to which these variants account for genetic, and not just phenotypic, variance.",

    "abstract": "Although the genetic risk to develop bipolar disorder is present from conception, the first frank symptoms of the illness generally become evident in late adolescence or early adulthood. However, except for pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD), it is still unclear when the first signs of the illness in adults become apparent and whether these are related to the genetic risk to develop bipolar disorder. This study examined whether underperformance at school precedes the onset of the illness and is a genetically related risk marker for developing bipolar disorder.\nInformation on school performance was obtained using objective archival data from 53 bipolar twin pairs (24 monozygotic (MZ), 29 dizygotic (DZ)) and 42 healthy matched control twin pairs (23 MZ, 19 DZ).\nAffected twin pairs completed significantly fewer years of education than did control twin pairs with no difference between bipolar patients and their non-bipolar cotwins. The underperformance at school in the affected twin pairs occurred in early adolescence at a significantly younger age than the control twin pairs and preceded the onset of the first frank episode of bipolar disorder by thirteen years. Median age at onset of underperformance was not different in the patients and their non-bipolar cotwins. The association between liability of bipolar disease and age of first underperformance was significant and could be explained by genetic factors.\nThe sample is not a population based twin sample.\nUnderperformance at school during early adolescence may be a genetic marker for the vulnerability to develop bipolar disorder.",

Chest x-rays showed complete left-sided radio-opacity in both the twins. The chest computed tomography scan with contrast confirmed the diagnoses of left-sided pulmonary agenesis (twin A) and left-sided hypoplasia (twin B).

    "abstract": "The relationship between personality and life span is not well understood, and no study to date has examined genetic influences underlying this relationship. The present study aimed to explore the phenotypic and genetic relationship between personality and life span, as well as genetic influences on all-cause mortality.\nProspective community-based study including 3752 twin individuals older than 50 years. Neuroticism, psychoticism, extraversion, and social desirability and pessimism/optimism were measured at baseline using the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and the Revised Life Orientation Test, respectively. Information on age at death was obtained 16 years after the initial assessment of personality.\nExtraversion was inversely related to mortality with the risk of death decreasing 3% per unit increase of the extraversion score. Psychoticism and pessimism were positively related to mortality with a 36% and 39% increase in risk of death per unit increase in the respective personality score. Heritability of life span was 7%. Cross-twin cross-trait hazard ratios (HRs) were only significant for optimism/pessimism in monozygotic (MZ) twins with no significant differences in HRs between MZ and dizygotic twins in all traits; however, there was a trend for slightly higher HRs in MZ compared with dizygotic twins in psychoticism and optimism/pessimism.\nExtraversion, psychoticism, and optimism/pessimism are significant predictors of longevity; extraversion is associated with a reduction, and pessimism and psychoticism are associated with an increase in mortality risk. Genetic influences on longevity in Australian twins are very low (7%). Our data also suggest a small, albeit nonsignificant, genetic influence on the relationship of pessimism and psychoticism with life span.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated in early embryonic life. Females are therefore mosaics for two cell populations, one with the maternal and one with the paternal X as the active X chromosome. A skewed X inactivation is a marked deviation from a 50:50 ratio. In populations of women past 55-60 years of age, an increased degree of skewing (DS) is found. Here the association between age-related skewing and mortality is analyzed in a 13-year follow-up study of 500 women from three cohorts (73-100 years of age at intake). Women with low DS had significantly higher mortality than the majority of women who had a more skewed DS (hazard ratio: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.04-1.64). The association between X inactivation and mortality was replicated in dizygotic twin pairs for which the co-twin with the lowest DS also had a statistically significant tendency to die first in the twin pairs with the highest intra-pair differences in DS (proportion: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.52-0.86). Both results suggest that lower DS is associated with higher mortality. We therefore propose that age-related skewing may be partly due to a population selection with lower mortality among those with higher DS.",

    "abstract": "Congenital complete heart block associated with transplacental passage of maternal autoantibodies reactive with SSA/Ro and SSB/La is a rare disease with significant fetal, neonatal, and childhood morbidity and mortality. We present the case of dichorionic, diamniotic twins (female twin A and male twin B) exposed to maternal Ro and La autoantibodies with different disease expression. Twin A (female) had Mobitz type I second degree atrioventricular (AV) block (Wenckebach); twin B (male) had normal sinus rhythm. Both twins had structurally normal hearts but demonstrated echocardiographic evidence of endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE). Following maternal dexamethasone 4 mg once daily, twin A reverted to sinus rhythm in utero; twin B remained in sinus rhythm throughout pregnancy. Echocardiograms after delivery demonstrated resolution of EFE in both fetuses, and EKGs confirmed sinus rhythm. However, at five months of age, Holter monitor demonstrated first degree AV block and intermittent Wenckebach in twin A. Twin B remains in sinus rhythm. This case is one of only three in the literature that describes Mobitz type I second degree atrioventricular block presenting in fetuses exposed to maternal SSA and SSB autoantibodies and is the first case that we have seen reported in twins. Importantly, this case also adds to the growing body of literature describing EFE as a presentation of neonatal lupus with or without conduction system abnormalities, emphasizes the spectrum of cardiac conduction abnormalities in neonatal lupus syndrome, and raises interesting questions about discordant disease expression in twins.",

    "abstract": "Associations of height and head circumference with IQ are well documented, but much less is known about the association of IQ with other anthropometric measures or the mechanisms behind these associations. We therefore analyzed the associations between IQ and several anthropometric measures using a twin-study design. Twins born in Minnesota were assessed at either age 11 (756 complete pairs) or 17 (626 complete pairs) and analyzed using genetic modeling. Head circumference and height showed the most consistent positive associations with IQ, whereas more detailed anthropometric measures were not significantly better predictors of IQ. These associations were mainly due to common genetic factors. Our results suggest that the same genetic factors have an effect on physical and cognitive development. Head circumference and height capture information on children's physical development, which is partly associated also with cognitive development.",

Twin families were registered with the Netherlands Twin Register. We included 1534 dizygotic (DZ) twins born after IVF, 5315 naturally conceived (NC) DZ twins, and 1504 control NC DZ twins who were matched to the IVF twins based on maternal age, maternal educational level, smoking during pregnancy, gestational age, and offspring sex. Data were obtained by longitudinal surveys sent to fathers, mothers, and teachers at ages 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 12 years. Results showed no differences in growth, in attainment of motor milestones, and in behavioral development between IVF and matched NC twins. It can be concluded that for nearly all aspects, development in IVF and NC children is similar.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal atresia in both twins from the same pregnancy is very rare. Only seven pairs of twins have been described. The authors report on two cases of monozygotic twins with different types of intestinal atresia and clinical evolution. Both pairs of observed twins turned out to be concordant for the presence of intestinal malformations and for the absence of other linked malformations; nevertheless, the atresic lesions were anatomically discordant in each pair of monozygotic twins. Therefore, the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures have shown some differences in phenotypic expression between the twins of both pairs. Possible etiologic factors and pathogenetic pathways are discussed, and the importance of an accurate clinical and instrumental investigation and a long-term follow-up is underlined. Very rare models, such as pairs of monozygotic twins presenting intestinal atresia, represent an extraordinary resource to add new clinical and laboratory information likely to be useful in future advancements to understand the underlying etiology and pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this audit was to assess the accuracy of transabdominal ultrasound scan in predicting chorionicity in twin pregnancies in our unit. The presence or absence of lambda sign, T-sign, dividing membrane thickness and number of placentae were used to determine chorionicity. We retrospectively analysed these antenatal markers in 268 sets of twins delivered over a 5 year period and compared it with the postpartum placental histology and neonatal gender. Of 268 twin deliveries, 204 (76%) had both chorionicity and placental histology to compare. 67 of 84 (80%) were correctly diagnosed antenatally as monochorionic and 137 of 151 (91%) as dichorionic. In 31 cases (15%) the ultrasound diagnosis of chorionicity didn't match placental histology. Seventeen were thought to be monochorionic antenatally but were confirmed dichorionic on placental histology. Overall chorionicity was correctly diagnosed in 171/204 (84%) using transabdominal ultrasound scan (USS) in all trimesters. However the sensitivity and specificity of USS was much higher for dichorionic twins when carried out before 14 weeks of gestation.",

    "abstract": "While it is generally accepted that monozygotic (MZ) twins are identical with respect to inherited traits, because they share 100% of their genetic material, clinical findings and scientific evidence does not support this belief. In addition to environmental factors and stochastic developmental events, a number of genetic mechanisms, detectable by new techniques in molecular genetics, explain the differences frequently observed in MZ twins.\nNine-year-old twin girls requested treatment for a dental malocclusion. Their facial and occlusal features were very similar. Panoramic radiographs revealed hypodontia of two permanent teeth in one twin (35 and 45) and of only one tooth in the other (45). An incorrect diagnosis of dizygosity (DZ) had been made at birth based on the presence of two amniotic sacs. Despite discordance in the dental complement of both girls their orthodontist suspected that the twins might be identical. A genetic study performed by quantitative fluorescence-polymerase chain reaction (QFPCR) analysis of chromosomes 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, and X confirmed that the twins were MZ.\nDiscordances in dental complement between MZ twins are not uncommon and do not exclude monozygosity.",

    "abstract": "Imprinting control regions are differentially methylated in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner and this methylation state is inherited through the germline. These regions control parent-specific monoallelic expression of their target genes. Genetically identical organisms show considerable variation in their epigenomes owing to environmental and stochastic influences creating fluctuations in phenotype. Monozygotic twin pairs discordant for imprinting disorders due to epigenetic changes at imprinting control regions are an example of phenotypic variation caused by extreme variations of the epigenome.

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide and related nitrogen species (reactive nitrogen species) now occupy a central position in contemporary medicine, physiology, biochemistry, and microbiology. In particular, NO plays important antimicrobial defenses in innate immunity but microbes have evolved intricate NO-sensing and defense mechanisms that are the subjects of a vast literature. Unfortunately, the burgeoning NO literature has not always been accompanied by an understanding of the intricacies and complexities of this radical and other reactive nitrogen species so that there exists confusion and vagueness about which one or more species exert the reported biological effects. The biological chemistry of NO and derived/related molecules is complex, due to multiple species that can be generated from NO in biological milieu and numerous possible reaction targets. Moreover, the fate and disposition of NO is always a function of its biological environment, which can vary significantly even within a single cell. In this review, we consider newer aspects of the literature but, most importantly, consider the underlying chemistry and draw attention to the distinctiveness of NO and its chemical cousins, nitrosonium (NO(+)), nitroxyl (NO(-), HNO), peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), nitrite (NO(2)(-)), and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)). All these species are reported to be generated in biological systems from initial formation of NO (from nitrite, NO synthases, or other sources) or its provision in biological experiments (typically from NO gas, S-nitrosothiols, or NO donor compounds). The major targets of NO and nitrosative damage (metal centers, thiols, and others) are reviewed and emphasis is given to newer \"-omic\" methods of unraveling the complex repercussions of NO and nitrogen oxide assaults. Microbial defense mechanisms, many of which are critical for pathogenicity, include the activities of hemoglobins that enzymically detoxify NO (to nitrate) and NO reductases and repair mechanisms (e.g., those that reverse S-nitrosothiol formation). Microbial resistance to these stresses is generally inducible and many diverse transcriptional regulators are involved-some that are secondary sensors (such as Fnr) and those that are \"dedicated\" (such as NorR, NsrR, NssR) in that their physiological function appears to be detecting primarily NO and then regulating expression of genes that encode enzymes with NO as a substrate. Although generally harmful, evidence is accumulating that NO may have beneficial effects, as in the case of the squid-Vibrio light-organ symbiosis, where NO serves as a signal, antioxidant, and specificity determinant. Progress in this area will require a thorough understanding not only of the biology but also of the underlying chemical principles.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation may play an essential role in the decline of physical performance. In this study we investigated the associations between inflammatory markers, candidate polymorphisms and physical performance in elderly people. Plasma levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen, sICAM-1 and candidate polymorphisms were measured in 600 twin individuals aged 73 years and older participating in the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins. Physical performance was assessed using a self-reported measure. The inclusion of twins allowed both traditional and within-twin-pair analysis which permitted control for shared environment and genetic factors. Higher levels of inflammatory markers were generally associated with a lower level of physical performance. The TNF\u03b1-238G/A polymorphism was significantly associated with physical performance in men, with A allele carriers having significantly better performance than GG homozygotes. However, this gene variation seems to have only a minor role in explaining the associations between the levels of inflammatory markers and physical performance. When using twin pair analysis to test whether genetic factors in general account for this association, results showed that the association between the level of fibrinogen and physical performance could be caused by genetic factors. Also the association between the level of TNF-\u03b1 and physical performance in males could be caused by genetic factors. However, other gene variations than the candidate gene polymorphisms studied here seem to explain the major part of the genetic proportion of this association.",

    "abstract": "Several case reports have linked solvent exposure to Parkinson disease (PD), but few studies have assessed associations with specific agents using an analytic epidemiologic design. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to specific solvents is associated with PD risk using a discordant twin pair design.\nNinety-nine twin pairs discordant for PD ascertained from the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council World War II Veteran Twins Cohort were interviewed regarding lifetime occupations and hobbies using detailed job task-specific questionnaires. Exposures to 6 specific solvents selected a priori were estimated by expert raters unaware of case status.\nEver exposure to trichloroethylene (TCE) was associated with significantly increased risk of PD (odds ratio [OR], 6.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-33; p = 0.034), and exposure to perchloroethylene (PERC) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4) ) tended toward significance (respectively: OR, 10.5; 95% CI, 0.97-113; p = 0.053; OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 0.9-6.1; p = 0.088). Results were similar for estimates of exposure duration and cumulative lifetime exposure.\nExposure to specific solvents may increase risk of PD. TCE is the most common organic contaminant in groundwater, and PERC and CCl(4) are also ubiquitous in the environment. Our findings require replication in other populations with well-characterized exposures, but the potential public health implications are substantial.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of phenotypic differences between monozygotic (MZ) twins is commonly attributed to environmental factors, assuming that MZ twins have a complete identical genetic make-up. Yet, recently several lines of evidence showed that both genetic and epigenetic factors could have a role in phenotypic discordance after all. A high occurrence of copy number variation (CNV) differences was observed within MZ twin pairs discordant for Parkinson's disease, thereby stressing on the importance of post-zygotic mutations as disease-predisposing events. In this study, the prevalence of discrepant CNVs was analyzed in discordant MZ twins of the Esophageal Atresia (EA) and Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) cohort in the Netherlands. Blood-derived DNA from 11 pairs (7 EA and 4 CDH) was screened using high-resolution SNP arrays. Results showed an identical copy number profile in each twin pair. Mosaic chromosome gain or losses could not be detected either with a detection threshold of 20%. Some of the germ-line structural events demonstrated in five out of eleven twin pairs could function as a susceptible genetic background. For example, the 177-Kb loss of chromosome 10q26 in CDH pair-3 harbors the TCF7L2 gene (Tcf4 protein), which is implicated in the regulation of muscle fiber type development and maturation. In conclusion, discrepant CNVs are not a common cause of twin discordancy in these investigated congenital anomaly cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins have been observed in a wide range of mammalian and non-mammalian species; they are considered to be more common in bovine, less frequent in sheep and pig and extremely rare in horse and goat. A pair of female conjoined twins was delivered from a 2-year-old Chamois-coloured domestic goat. Post-mortem examination revealed two identical and symmetrical twins, fused from the manubrium sterni to the region just caudal to the umbilicus. The rib cages were conjoined in the ventral plane with a single set of pericardial, pleural and peritoneal cavities. Internal examination revealed the presence of a common diaphragm and a single enlarged liver. Within a single central pericardium, two malformed hearts were present. Reports on this type of congenital duplication in goats have not been found in the literature. Thoracopagus and thoraco-omphalopagus are the most common types of conjoined twins in human beings and are associated with the highest mortality because of the frequent incidence of complex cardiac anatomy.",

    "abstract": "This case report involved male infants of a size consistent with the estimated gestational age of 31 weeks. The mother of the twins was a 27-year-old, G4P3 woman with limited prenatal care who presented for cesarean delivery. Resuscitation efforts were initiated and continued until the infants became asystolic. Postmortem radiographs showed innumerable fractures of the limbs, ribs, and skull in various states of healing with callus formation; hence, the fractures were of prenatal origin. Despite the fractures, the growth of the long bones was not impaired. The radiographic findings were initially thought to represent osteogenesis imperfecta type IIC. However, there were also vascular anomalies not explained by this phenotype. Grossly, all arteries were elongated, thickened, and tortuous. The carotids, descending aorta, and iliac arteries were redundant to such an extent that they produced corkscrew patterns. There was also cutis laxa with loose, redundant skin over the entire body. Collagen genes did not show any mutations; however, when it was suggested Fibulin-4 be studied because of overlap with the condition described by Dasouki and colleagues in 2007, a homozygous premature stop codon mutation was found in that gene.",

    "abstract": "Identical twins account for 0.2% of the world population and 8% of all twins. A \"mirror image\" variation can be found in 25% of identical twins. Studies of twins assume a special place in human genetics due to the possibility of comparing genetic and other factors. We present two pairs of identical male twins with mirror-image astigmatism and esotropia.\nThe first was a pair of twelve-year old identical twins with \"mirror image\" myopic astigmatism. The Twin 1 had myopic astigmatism in the right eye, while the Twin 2 was affected by the left eye myopic astigmatism. The second was a pair of six-year old identical twins with esotropia and hypermetropic astigmatism. The Twin 1 had esotropia in the left eye, while the right eye was affected in the Twin 2. Esotropia was surgically corrected.\nIn this study we pointed to the role of genetic factors in the development of refractive error, as well as the type of strabismus. Refraction anomalies (myopia, hypermetropia and astigmatism) are complex heterogeneous disorders and ideal for genetic investigation. The knowledge of genetic mechanisms involved in refractive error susceptibility may allow treatment to prevent progression or to further examine gene-environment interactions. We hope that this paper will initiate further investigation of refraction anomalies in twins and future multicentre studies, which, to our knowledge, have not been conducted in our country so far.",

In both cases, prolonged action of succinylcholine caused by a butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) deficiency was confirmed by means of the dibucaine number test. In both cases, genetic analysis using the polymerase chain reaction revealed haplotype combined A and K variant mutations of the BCHE gene, both in the heterozygous form. These data show the potential risk of BCHE deficiency as a complication of anesthesia during ECT, and in particular underline the possible genetic contribution within a complex pathogenetic model.",

    "abstract": "Genetic studies in adults indicate that genes influencing the personality trait of neuroticism account for substantial genetic variance in anxiety and depression and in somatic health. Here, we examine for the first time the factors underlying the relationship between neuroticism and anxiety/depressive and somatic symptoms during adolescence.\nThe Somatic and Psychological Health Report (SPHERE) assessed symptoms of anxiety/depression (PSYCH-14) and somatic distress (SOMA-10) in 2459 adolescent and young adult twins [1168 complete pairs (35.4% monozygotic, 53% female)] aged 12-25 years (mean=15.5 \u00b1 2.9). Differences between boys and girls across adolescence were explored for neuroticism, SPHERE-34, and the subscales PSYCH-14 and SOMA-10. Trivariate analyses partitioned sources of covariance in neuroticism, PSYCH-14 and SOMA-10.\nGirls scored higher than boys on both neuroticism and SPHERE, with SPHERE scores for girls increasing slightly over time, whereas scores for boys decreased or were unchanged. Neuroticism and SPHERE scores were strongly influenced by genetic factors [heritability (h(2)) = 40-52%]. A common genetic source influenced neuroticism, PSYCH-14 and SOMA-10 (impacting PSYCH-14 more than SOMA-10). A further genetic source, independent of neuroticism, accounted for covariation specific to PSYCH-14 and SOMA-10. Environmental influences were largely specific to each measure.\nIn adolescence, genetic risk factors indexed by neuroticism contribute substantially to anxiety/depression and, to a lesser extent, perceived somatic health. Additional genetic covariation between anxiety/depressive and somatic symptoms, independent of neuroticism, had greatest influence on somatic distress, where it was equal in influence to the factor shared with neuroticism.",

A common genetic source influenced neuroticism, PSYCH-14 and SOMA-10 (impacting PSYCH-14 more than SOMA-10). A further genetic source, independent of neuroticism, accounted for covariation specific to PSYCH-14 and SOMA-10. Environmental influences were largely specific to each measure.",

    "abstract": "To estimate the risk of preterm delivery of twin pregnancies based upon sonographic cervical length measurement and gestational age at measurement.\nTwin pregnancies that delivered between 1999 and 2005 and that underwent sonographic measurement of cervical length between 13 and 34 + 6 weeks' gestation were identified and a retrospective review performed. Women with anomalous pregnancies, multifetal reduction, cerclage placement or medically indicated deliveries before 35 weeks were excluded. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk of preterm delivery before 35 weeks.\nA total of 561 women underwent 2975 sonographic cervical length measurements during the study period. The rate of preterm delivery before 35 weeks was 19.4%. The risk of delivery before 35 weeks decreased by approximately 5% for each additional mm of cervical length (odds ratio (OR) 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97); P < 0.001) and by approximately 6% for each additional week at which the cervical length was measured (OR 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92-0.96); P < 0.001).\nThe gestational age at which cervical length is measured is an important consideration when estimating the risk of spontaneous preterm birth in twins. The risk of preterm delivery is increased at earlier gestational ages and as cervical length decreases.",

    "abstract": "Although systemic autoimmune diseases (SAID) share many clinical and laboratory features, whether they also share some common features of pathogenesis remains unclear. We assessed plasma proteomic profiles among different SAID for evidence of common molecular pathways that could provide insights into pathogenic mechanisms shared by these diseases.\nDifferential quantitative proteomic analyses (one-dimensional reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) were performed to assess patterns of plasma protein expression. Monozygotic twins (four pairs discordant for systemic lupus erythematosus, four pairs discordant for juvenile idiopathic arthritis and two pairs discordant for juvenile dermatomyositis) were studied to minimize polymorphic gene effects. Comparisons were also made to 10 unrelated, matched controls.\nMultiple plasma proteins, including acute phase reactants, structural proteins, immune response proteins, coagulation and transcriptional factors, were differentially expressed similarly among the different SAID studied. Multivariate Random Forest modeling identified seven proteins whose combined altered expression levels effectively segregated affected vs. unaffected twins. Among these seven proteins, four were also identified in univariate analyses of proteomic data (syntaxin 17, \u03b1-glucosidase, paraoxonase 1, and the sixth component of complement). Molecular pathway modeling indicated that these factors may be integrated through interactions with a candidate plasma biomarker, PON1 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6.\nTogether, these data suggest that different SAID may share common alterations of plasma protein expression and molecular pathways. An understanding of the mechanisms leading to the altered plasma proteomes common among these SAID may provide useful insights into their pathogeneses.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the human gut microbiota and host are affected by probiotic bacterial strains requires carefully controlled studies in humans and in mouse models of the gut ecosystem where potentially confounding variables that are difficult to control in humans can be constrained. Therefore, we characterized the fecal microbiomes and metatranscriptomes of adult female monozygotic twin pairs through repeated sampling 4 weeks before, 7 weeks during, and 4 weeks after consumption of a commercially available fermented milk product (FMP) containing a consortium of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, two strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus thermophilus. In addition, gnotobiotic mice harboring a 15-species model human gut microbiota whose genomes contain 58,399 known or predicted protein-coding genes were studied before and after gavage with all five sequenced FMP strains. No significant changes in bacterial species composition or in the proportional representation of genes encoding known enzymes were observed in the feces of humans consuming the FMP. Only minimal changes in microbiota configuration were noted in mice after single or repeated gavage with the FMP consortium. However, RNA-Seq analysis of fecal samples and follow-up mass spectrometry of urinary metabolites disclosed that introducing the FMP strains into mice results in significant changes in expression of microbiome-encoded enzymes involved in numerous metabolic pathways, most prominently those related to carbohydrate metabolism. B. animalis subsp. lactis, the dominant persistent member of the FMP consortium in gnotobiotic mice, up-regulates a locus in vivo that is involved in the catabolism of xylooligosaccharides, a class of glycans widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and other foods, underscoring the importance of these sugars to this bacterial species. The human fecal metatranscriptome exhibited significant changes, confined to the period of FMP consumption, that mirror changes in gnotobiotic mice, including those related to plant polysaccharide metabolism. These experiments illustrate a translational research pipeline for characterizing the effects of FMPs on the human gut microbiome.",

    "abstract": "A 17-year-old girl presented with a rare case of parasitic rachipagus conjoined twins associated with spina bifida, diplomyelia, scoliosis, tethered cord syndrome, and ventricular septal defect. Physical examination found a well developed breast and an apophysis on the back of the patient, and neuroimaging demonstrated scoliosis, spina bifida from T8 to L5, butterfly-shaped vertebra of T6, abnormal bone behind T7, diplomyelia, and tethered cord. Successful surgical excision of the parasitic mass was performed. Histological examination discovered uterine tube, Muller's duct, bone, cartilage, and nerve tissue besides the mammary gland. Rachipagus conjoined twins are extremely rare, but should be considered if well developed abnormal tissue is found in the dorsal midline of the spine. However, the possibility of malformations in other organs in the autosite should be considered. Careful preoperative examination and refined microsurgery may provide good outcome for the patient.",

    "abstract": "Population-based, retrospective cohort.\nTo determine whether radiating spinal pain from the low back, mid back, and neck is associated with future use of health-related benefits and their duration as compared with those with nonradiating spinal pain.\nStudies on the socioeconomic consequences of radiating pain have primarily focused on the low back and to a lesser extent on the neck and mid back. In addition, few studies report on the incidence of health-related benefit use after any radiating spinal pain.\nA cohort of 22,952 subjects was formed from the 2002 survey of the Danish Twin Registry. The survey contained information on spinal pain and important confounding factors. Work disability for an 8-year period was determined through data linkage with the Danish Register-Based Evaluation of Marginalization (DREAM) register of government transfer payments. We determined the incidence rate ratio for receipt of sickness benefit and the mean duration of the first and total sickness benefit periods by radiating and nonradiating spinal pain. Relative risks for the occurrence and number of sickness benefit episodes were calculated by radiating spinal pain status.\nThe incidence of sickness benefit was greater for those with radiating spinal pain (89.6 per 1000 person-years [95% confidence interval: 86.0, 93.2]) than those with nonradiating spinal pain (60.4 per 1000 person-years [95% confidence interval: 57.7, 63.1]). However, the duration of time off work, conditional on 1 day or more off work, was the same between those with and without radiating spinal pain.\nRadiating spinal pain is an important risk factor for future sickness benefit. Radiating spinal pain was not associated with the duration of sickness benefit. These findings were independent of the effects of pain duration at baseline. The results highlight the need for interventions to prevent the onset of work disability, especially for those with radiating pain.",

    "abstract": "Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) shortens with age and is potentially a biomarker of human aging. We examined the relation of LTL with physical ability and cognitive function in 548 same-sex twins from the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins. LTL was measured by Southern blots of the terminal restriction fragments (TRF). Physical ability was evaluated using a self reported scale of 11 questions, while cognitive function was scored by MMSE and a cognitive composite score sensitive to age-related decline. A random intercept model revealed a positive, significant association between LTL and physical ability. For every unit increase in physical ability score, LTL increased by 0.066 kb (p = 0.01), equal to approximately three years of age-dependent LTL shortening. A matched case-co-twin design showed that the group consisting of the twins from each pair with the longer LTL also displayed better physical ability (p < 0.01). Moreover, the intra-pair difference in LTL was associated with intra-pair difference in physical ability (p < 0.01), confirming the association. However, we found no association between cognitive function and LTL. The LTL-physical ability association in the elderly provides further support to the premise that LTL is an index of somatic fitness in the narrow context of human physical health.",

    "abstract": "From an aircraft, a short distinct vertical structure is sometimes seen above the setting sun. Such a feature can be understood as a halo, which is the counterpart of the well-known subsun. Whereas the latter arises from reflections off basal faces of plate-oriented ice crystals illuminated from above, what we call the supersun emerges when these crystals are illuminated from below. The supersun occurs when the sun is below the true horizon and is only visible from elevated positions. The curvature of the Earth causes the ensemble of reflecting crystal faces to act as a hollow mirror and the supersun appears as a vertical band of uniform width, extending from the sun upwards to its supersolar point. We discuss the geometrical properties of the phenomenon and simulate its shape and radiance distribution with an extended version of an atmospheric ray-tracing program.",

    "abstract": "Transmission of excreted vaccine-derived infectious virus from vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals is possible within close contacts. This randomized (1:1), double-blind study evaluated the potential for transmission of human rotavirus vaccine strain, HRV (Rotarix\u2122) from vaccine recipients to unvaccinated close contacts (twins). 100 pairs of healthy twins aged 6-14 weeks at the time of Dose 1 of HRV vaccine/placebo were enrolled and one randomly selected twin from each pair received two vaccine doses and the other received placebo doses (at 2 and 4 months of age). Presence of vaccine strain in the stool samples of placebo recipients was an indicator of transmission. Serial stool samples were tested for rotavirus using ELISA at pre-determined time points; rotavirus positive stool samples were tested with RT-PCR and reverse hybridization assay to identify G1P[8] vaccine strain. If G1P[8] vaccine strain was detected, the complete genome was sequenced to assess the similarity between viral isolates. Immunogenicity and safety of HRV vaccine in transmission cases was assessed. 15 transmission cases were reported in 80 evaluable twins who received placebo and the transmission rate was 18.8% (95% CI: 10.9-29.0%). None of the transmission cases was associated with gastroenteritis symptoms. Anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion was 62.5% (95% CI: 51.0-73.1%) (HRV) and 21.3% (95% CI: 12.9-31.8%) (placebo) 7-weeks post-Dose 2; seroconversion in transmission cases was 26.7% (95% CI: 7.8-55.1%). Genetic variations or amino acid substitutions in transmission cases were similar to that seen in corresponding vaccine recipients. Transmission of HRV vaccine strain to unvaccinated twins living in close contact occurred, however, they were not associated with increased of gastroenteritis. Whether transmission leads to indirect protection among unvaccinated individuals remains unknown at this stage.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins (CT) are a very rare developmental accident of uncertain etiology. Prevalence has been previously estimated to be 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 births. The process by which monozygotic twins do not fully separate but form CT is not well understood. The purpose of the present study was to analyze diverse epidemiological aspects of CT, including the different variables listed in the Introduction Section of this issue of the Journal. The study was made possible using the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (ICBDSR) structure. This multicenter worldwide research includes the largest sample of CT ever studied. A total of 383 carefully reviewed sets of CT obtained from 26,138,837 births reported by 21 Clearinghouse Surveillance Programs (SP) were included in the analysis. Total prevalence was 1.47 per 100,000 births (95% CI: 1.32-1.62). Salient findings including an evident variation in prevalence among SPs: a marked variation in the type of pregnancy outcome, a similarity in the proportion of CT types among programs: a significant female predominance in CT: particularly of the thoracopagus type and a significant male predominance in parapagus and parasitic types: significant differences in prevalence by ethnicity and an apparent increasing prevalence trend in South American countries. No genetic, environmental or demographic significant associated factors were identified. Further work in epidemiology and molecular research is necessary to understand the etiology and pathogenesis involved in the development of this fascinating phenomenon of nature.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are a rare congenital anomaly with an estimated incidence of 1/50,000 to 1/100,000. Among thoracopagus conjoined twins, 75% have a fused heart. We compare the usefulness of various modalities for evaluating cardiovascular structure in fused-heart conjoined twins. We report a series of 20 sets of thoracopagus conjoined twins as well as the results of a PubMed database literature review literature from 1982 to 2009. Twenty sets of fused-heart thoracopagus conjoined twins were evaluated by echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, magnetic resonance image (MRI), and three-dimensional computed tomography angiography (3D-CTA). Imaging results were compared to findings at surgery or autopsy. All sets of conjoined twins underwent postnatal echocardiography; 11 sets (55%) underwent cardiac catheterization; 4 sets (20%) underwent MRI; and 1 set (5%) underwent 3D-CTA. All intracardiac anatomy (ICA) was identified by echocardiography. Cardiac catheterization, MRI, and 3D-CTA were able to identify extracardiac vascular structures as well as the ICA. 3D-CTA, which can be performed as early as the first week of life, is a noninvasive, less expensive, and the safe examination with minimal risk due to its short procedural time. Three-dimensional CTA is an effective and safe modality for evaluating the cardiovascular anatomy of fused-heart conjoined twins before surgery.",

    "abstract": "One of the best studied read-outs of epigenetic change is the differential expression of imprinted genes, controlled by differential methylation of imprinted control regions (ICRs). To address the impact of genotype on the epigenome, we performed a detailed study in 128 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) and 128 pairs of dizygotic (DZ) twins, interrogating the DNA methylation status of the ICRs of IGF2, H19, KCNQ1, GNAS and the non-imprinted gene RUNX1. While we found a similar overall pattern of methylation between MZ and DZ twins, we also observed a high degree of variability in individual CpG methylation levels, notably at the H19/IGF2 loci. A degree of methylation plasticity independent of the genome sequence was observed, with both local and regional CpG methylation changes, discordant between MZ and DZ individual pairs. However, concordant gains or losses of methylation, within individual twin pairs were more common in MZ than DZ twin pairs, indicating that de novo and/or maintenance methylation is influenced by the underlying DNA sequence. Specifically, for the first time we showed that the rs10732516 [A] polymorphism, located in a critical CTCF binding site in the H19 ICR locus, is strongly associated with increased hypermethylation of specific CpG sites in the maternal H19 allele. Together, our results highlight the impact of the genome on the epigenome and demonstrate that while DNA methylation states are tightly maintained between genetically identical and related individuals, there remains considerable epigenetic variation that may contribute to disease susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM) account for a significant percentage of brain hemorrhages in pregnant patients. There is general consensus that ruptured AVMs in pregnant women should be managed based on neurosurgical rather than obstetric considerations. Since the risk of re-hemorrhage is significantly higher in the pregnant patient with a ruptured AVM, aggressive treatment during pregnancy must be considered if this can be accomplished with acceptable risk. Recent advances in endovascular technology have increased the potential for successful treatment of previously inoperable high-grade AVMs.\nA 17-year-old woman pregnant with twins experienced sudden onset headache and became unresponsive at 20 weeks gestation. A CT scan of the head showed cerebellar hemorrhage and obstructive hydrocephalus. Cerebral angiography showed a 5.5 cm AVM in the cerebellar vermis with deep drainage for a Spetzler Martin grade IV classification. Extensive two-stage Onyx embolization with complete casting of the nidus was performed. The patient delivered healthy twin girls at 36 weeks gestation by a planned cesarean section. This was followed by surgical resection of the AVM 4 months later with minimal blood loss. A follow-up angiogram showed no evidence of AVM recurrence 3 months after surgical resection. Her balance was significantly improved and she walked unassisted. She had mild cerebellar speech. Her twin girls are progressing normally.\nExtensive endovascular Onyx embolization is feasible in the setting of a ruptured high-grade AVM during pregnancy. The rationale for proceeding with treatment is the perceived higher likelihood of re-hemorrhage from such a lesion.",

    "abstract": "Centriole duplication is a tightly regulated process that must occur only once per cell cycle; otherwise, supernumerary centrioles can induce aneuploidy and tumorigenesis. Plk4 (Polo-like kinase 4) activity initiates centriole duplication and is regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Throughout interphase, Plk4 autophosphorylation triggers its degradation, thus preventing centriole amplification. However, Plk4 activity is required during mitosis for proper centriole duplication, but the mechanism stabilizing mitotic Plk4 is unknown. In this paper, we show that PP2A (Protein Phosphatase 2A(Twins)) counteracts Plk4 autophosphorylation, thus stabilizing Plk4 and promoting centriole duplication. Like Plk4, the protein level of PP2A's regulatory subunit, Twins (Tws), peaks during mitosis and is required for centriole duplication. However, untimely Tws expression stabilizes Plk4 inappropriately, inducing centriole amplification. Paradoxically, expression of tumor-promoting simian virus 40 small tumor antigen (ST), a reported PP2A inhibitor, promotes centrosome amplification by an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that ST actually mimics Tws function in stabilizing Plk4 and inducing centriole amplification.",

    "abstract": "The incidence rates of anterior neural tube defects, anencephaly and encephalocele appear increased among twins compared with singletons. The current study aimed to evaluate whether the etiology of this phenomenon is related to twinning, assisted reproductive technology (ART), or both.\nThe study cohort consisted of parturient women who were referred to our ultrasonography unit between January 1998 and December 2009 due to suspicion of severe fetal abnormality. The study cohort was divided into two subgroups based on mode of conception: spontaneous and ART (including IVF and ICSI). The subgroups were further subdivided into singleton and multiple pregnancies. We also compared pregnancies diagnosed with anencephaly in the study group to all live births in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\nAnencephaly was diagnosed in 43 fetuses out of 1154 (3.7%) pregnancies diagnosed with severe fetal anomaly. Anencephaly was diagnosed in 9 out of 78 twin pregnancies (11.5%); of these, 8 of 45 (17.8%) were ART conceived and 1 of 33 (3%) spontaneously conceived. A significant correlation was found between twinning and anencephaly, with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.4 [confidence interval (CI) = 1.3-8.9, P= 0.011], while no significant correlation was found between ART and anencephaly. A significant correlation was found between anencephaly and the combination of ART conception and twinning (OR of 6.6, CI = 2.8-15.3, P< 0.01). Analyzing the distribution of pregnancies diagnosed with anencephaly in the study group compared with the total number of live births in the department revealed a significant correlation between twinning and anencephaly, with an OR of 11.4 (CI = 4.9-26.5, P< 0.01), with no significant correlation between ART and anencephaly. Among all live births, a significant correlation was found between anencephaly and the combination of ART conception and twinning (OR of 24.6, CI = 11.4-53.2, P< 0.01).\nOur data suggest that twin pregnancies conceived by ART constitute a high-risk group for anencephaly, due to a possible synergistic effect of twinning and ART.",

    "abstract": "As monozygotic (MZ) twins are believed to be genetically identical, discordance for disease phenotype between MZ twins has been used in genetic research to understand the contribution of genetic vs environmental factors in disease development. However, recent studies show that MZ twins can differ both genetically and epigenetically. Screening MZ twins for genetic and/or epigenetic differences could be a useful and novel approach to identify modifying factors influencing phenotypic expression of disease. MZ twins that are phenotypically discordant for monogenic diseases are of special interest. Such occurrences have been described for Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxias, as well as for familial forms of Alzheimer's disease. By comparing MZ twins that are phenotypically discordant, crucial factors influencing the phenotypic expression of the disease could be identified, which may be of relevance for understanding disease pathogenesis and variability in disease phenotype. Overall, understanding the crucial factors in development of a neurodegenerative disorder will have relevance for predictive testing, preventive treatment and could help to identify novel therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Thymectomy is standard therapy fornonthymomatousmyasthenia gravis despite the absence of randomized clinical trials (1). Myasthenia gravis is uncommonly reported in monozygous twins; disease concordance occurs in approximately one third of such identical twin pairs; and treatment for myasthenia gravis, when described,is usually concordant in identical twin pairs (2).\nTo report an 11-year clinical course of a pair of identical twins concordant for generalized acetylcholine receptor antibody\u2013positive nonthymomatous myasthenia gravis in whom only 1 was treated with extended transsternal thymectomy.\nTwin A was a 19-year-old white woman who presented with an 8-week history of intermittent leg weakness, causing her to fall during activities, such as climbing stairs. On examination,she had moderately severe fatigable proximal muscle weakness and ptosis. Her weakness improved with intravenous edrophonium administration.Initial binding acetylcholine receptor antibody titer was 1.22 nmol/L (normal value, 0.03 nmol/L). Repetitive 2-Hz nerve(median, ulnar, and facial) stimulation studies demonstrated up to a 16% decremental response. Chest computed tomography showed residual thymic tissue without thymoma. An extended transsternal thymectomy was performed 11 weeks after the onset of symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Differential effects of genes and environment can contribute to etiological heterogeneity in schizophrenia. Twins concordant and discordant for schizophrenia may differ in genetic predisposition to schizophrenia with concordant twins having a higher genetic liability and discordant twins having a lower genetic liability to schizophrenia. We aimed to investigate whether P300 amplitude (which has been postulated as a genetic marker for schizophrenia) reflected this heterogeneity.\nWe compared P300 amplitudes across 36 monozygotic twin pairs (6 concordant for schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, 11 discordant and 19 healthy control pairs) performing an auditory oddball task, using multiple regression (age, gender, birth order, premorbid IQ as covariates). We further looked at the correlation between the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and P300 amplitude in affected twins, and compared concordant and discordant affected twins on the Global Assessment Scale (GAS).\nMultiple regression yielded a highly significant model (p = 0.004) though the explained variance was limited (21%). The main effect of the group on P300 amplitude was significant (p = 0.0001): affected concordant twins showed a significantly lower P300 amplitude as compared to affected discordant (p = 0.005, Cohen's d = 1.08) and control twins (p = 0.000, d = 1.16). Discordant affected and unaffected twins did not differ significantly from each other or from control twins. P300 did not correlate significantly with the BPRS and the affected groups did not differ across the GAS.\nOur results provide evidence for etiological heterogeneity within schizophrenia pointing to different pathophysiological mechanisms that may underlie more and less genetically determined forms of schizophrenia. They also indicate that P300 correlates with a differing degree of genetic liability to schizophrenia independently of the psychopathological status and even in the presence of similar functional profiles.",

    "abstract": "In this work we review the indications for late preterm and early-term birth in uncomplicated dichorionic, monochorionic, and monoamniotic twin gestations. Uncomplicated dichorionic twins have optimal outcomes when delivered at 38 weeks' gestation. Monochorionic twins, however, are at greater risk for unexpected stillbirth, and a management plan of late preterm delivery (34-37 weeks) after informed consent is reasonable. Monoamniotic twins are at even greater risk for sudden intrauterine fetal demise, and it is recommended that these expectant mothers be managed by inpatient hospitalization with fetal testing 1-3 times per day and delivery between 32 and 34 weeks' gestation. Recommendations are also provided for the circumstance of single intrauterine fetal demise in a twin gestation.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether growth discordance is an independent risk factor in the neonatal outcome of the smaller twin, all medical records of twin pregnancies delivered between 26 and 41 weeks during a 5-year period (January 2004-December 2008) were reviewed. Among the 49 selected twins, weight discordance was 15-20% in 7 infants, 21-30% in 16 infants, 31-40% in 16 infants and > 40% in 10 infants. No significant differences between the four groups were found with regards to obstetric complications and neonatal disease. Occurrence of birthweight below the 10th percentile and rate of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit significantly increased as intra-pair birthweight difference increased (p = .03). The > 40% discordant group had a significantly lower gestational age (p = .03), lower birthweight (p = .007) and a significantly higher mortality rate (4/10 versus 3/39 p = .04) in comparison with the other discordant groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that birthweight was the single independent and consistent factor associated with elevated risks of mortality. For every 250 g increase in birthweight, the risk for mortality decreased by about 84% [RR 0.16(CI 0.00-0.70)]. Gestational age was the most reliable predictor for major neonatal complications. For every 1-week increase in gestational age a significant decreased risk for all outcomes was found. Discordance alone should not be considered as a predictor for adverse neonatal outcome. Neonatal outcome in discordant twins appears to be related to gestational age and birthweight rather than to the degree of discordance.",

We assessed the status of BCR-ABL1 and IKZF1 genes in 2 pairs of monozygotic twins, one pair concordant, the other discordant for Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph(+)) ALL. The twin pair concordant for ALL shared identical BCR-ABL1 genomic sequence indicative of monoclonal, in utero origin. One twin had IKZF1 deletion and died after transplantation. The other twin had hyperdiploidy, no IKZF1 deletion, and is still in remission 8 years after transplantation. In the twin pair discordant for ALL, neonatal blood spots from both twins harbored the same clonotypic BCR-ABL1 sequence. Low level BCR-ABL1(+) cells were present in the healthy co-twin but lacked the IKZF1 deletion present in the other twin's leukemic cells. The twin with ALL relapsed and died after transplantation. The co-twin remains healthy and leukemia free. These data show that in childhood Ph(+) ALL, BCR-ABL1 gene fusion can be a prenatal and possibly initiating genetic event. In the absence of additional, secondary changes, the leukemic clone remains clinically silent. IKZF1 is a secondary and probable postnatal mutation in these cases, and as a recurrent but alternative copy number change is associated with poor prognosis.",

    "abstract": "We describe monozygotic twins with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) associated to antiphospholipid antibodies with a dissimilar clinical expression. The first patient was diagnosed to have ITP at 63 years old and was treated with corticosteroids. She presented ulterior exacerbations of thrombocytopenia requiring intravenous immunoglobulin and subsequent treatment with rituximab. She ultimately had a favorable response without thrombotic events during follow-up. The second patient who had a history of three spontaneous abortions and endometrial adenocarcinoma in complete remission was evaluated for severe thrombocytopenia, ITP was diagnosed at the age of 63. She was treated with steroids and had a favorable response. After few months she developed deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism requiring anticoagulation therapy without hemorrhagic events. Both patients were found to have antiphospholipid antibodies and HLA DR4 (DRB1*04) and HLA DR5 (DRB1*12). The association of those two entities in monozygotic twins could support the presence of common predisposing genes. However, with both patients being genotipically identical, the clinical expression was different. Those cases highlight the possibility that environmental factors may affect the expression of those disorders.",

    "abstract": "A retrospective cohort study was carried out in a university teaching hospital to determine the prospective risk of unexpected fetal death in uncomplicated monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies after viability. All MCDA twins delivered at or after 24 weeks' gestation from July 1999 to July 2007 were included. Pregnancies with twin-twin transfusion syndrome, growth restriction, structural abnormalities, or twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence were excluded. Of the 144 MCDA twin pregnancies included in our analysis, the risk of intrauterine death was 4.9%. The prospective risk of unexpected intrauterine death was 1 in 43 after 32 weeks' gestation and 1 in 37 after 34 weeks' gestation. Our results demonstrate that despite close surveillance, the unexpected intrauterine death rate in uncomplicated MCDA twin pregnancies is high. This rate seems to increase after 34 weeks' gestation, suggesting that a policy of elective preterm delivery warrants evaluation.",

    "abstract": "We studied whether self-reported intent to exert cognitive control over eating was associated with differences in brain response to food cues, independent of genetic background. Subjects were ten pairs of identical twins in which one twin was a restrained eater and the co-twin was unrestrained, as classified by the Herman and Polivy Restraint Scale. Before and after ingestion of a milkshake, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain response to photographs of objects, \"fattening\" food, and \"non-fattening\" food. At baseline, restrained eaters had greater activation in the left amygdala and the right thalamus in response to fattening food cues than did their unrestrained co-twins. When restrained eaters drank a milkshake, activation in response to fattening food photographs decreased across multiple brain areas, whereas activation induced by non-fattening food photographs increased. As compared to their unrestrained co-twins, restrained eaters who drank a milkshake had greater decreases in activation by fattening food images in the left amygdala and occipital lobe, and greater increases in activation by non-fattening food images in the medial orbitofrontal cortex. Because of the discordant monozygotic twin study design, the findings provide a rigorous level of support for the hypothesis that adopting an intention to restrain eating alters brain response to food cues.",

One of them showed diffuse mesangial proliferation with crescent formations in the glomeruli, moderate proteinuria and required intensive therapies including corticosteroids for remission. In contrast, the other had only focal mesangial alterations and exhibited only a subtle level of urinary abnormalities throughout the follow-up without steroid therapy. Although our monozygotic twins have completely identical genotypes, the clinicopathological features of their IgAN were quite discordant. The present cases suggest that not only genetic factors but also epigenetic differences may be involved in the progression of IgAN.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the association between sleep duration and insulin resistance in rural Chinese adults and examine whether any such associations are independent of adiposity.\nThis is a cross-sectional analysis of 854 men and 640 women aged 20 to 70 years from the Anqing Twin Cohort. The following measures were obtained for each subject: Body mass index (BMI) and percentage of trunk fat (%TF), fasting plasma glucose, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), self-reported sleep duration and measures of snoring and sleep disturbance from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Indices (PSQI) questionnaire were modified for a Chinese population. Multivariate linear regressions were applied to examine the association of sleep duration with HOMA-IR, with and without adjustment for adiposity variables, along with other relevant covariates.\nIn this sample of relatively lean rural Chinese adults, short sleep duration was associated with HOMA-IR in women but not in men. In women, short (\u2264 7 h/night) sleep duration was associated with a higher HOMA-IR (p=0.003) compared with normal sleep duration (>7 to \u2264 8 h/night) after adjustment for all the covariates except adiposity. Further adjustment for BMI or %TF attenuated the sleep-HOMA-IR association, but the association remained significant upon adjustment for BMI (p=0.013); and upon adjustment for %TF (p=0.026). Long sleep duration (> 8 h/night) was not significantly associated with HOMA-IR.\nIn this rural Chinese cohort, short sleep duration is independently associated with increased insulin resistance among women only, even after adjusting for adiposity and other potential confounders.",

    "abstract": "A first case of newborn Tibetan macaque (Macaca thibetana) twins was observed in a free-ranging group at Huangshan, China. The female that gave birth to the twins was studied during their first 5 months post-partum, and her activity budget was compared to those of adult females with single or no offspring in order to assess her behavioral changes. Our report shows that female Tibetan macaques can produce twins, and that twins can successfully survive. The adult female with twins spent more time foraging and resting, but less time moving and engaged in other social behaviors than adult females with a single infant or no infant. Our report provides a case of successfully surviving twins in a wild environment and suggests that the mother modified her behavior patterns to adapt to the heavy burden. We conclude that both food provisioning and the mother's behavioral strategies facilitated the survivorship of twins. This expands our understanding of the reproductive biology of Tibetan macaques.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of craniopagus twins approximates four to six per 10 million births. Although rare, surgical separation of conjoined twins poses significant technical and ethical challenges. The present report uses the case of craniopagus twins AD and TD to examine the bioethical issues faced by a multidisciplinary medical team in planning the separation of craniopagus twins. AD and TD are craniopagus twins conjoined at the head. TD's head is conjoined to the back of AD's head. Neurologically, AD has the dominant cerebral circulation. TD has two normal kidneys, whereas AD has none. AD depends on TD's renal function and, on separation, will require either a kidney transplant or lifelong dialysis. This case report reviews one approach to analyzing and solving complex ethical dilemmas in pediatric plastic surgery. The principles reviewed are (1) autonomy and informed consent, focusing especially on the role of children in the informed consent process; (2) beneficence and nonmaleficence, two intricately intertwined principles because separation could potentially cause irreversible harm to one twin while improving the quality of life for the other (as separation is not a life-saving procedure, is it ethical to perform a procedure with unknown surgical risk to improve children's quality of life?); and (3) justice (is it fair to allocate excessive medical resources for the twins' separation?). The present report explores the ethics behind such decisions with respect to the separation of conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "The cardiometabolic syndrome comprised of multiple correlated traits, but its origin is incompletely understood. Chromogranin A (CHGA) is required for formation of the catecholamine secretory pathway in sympathochromaffin cells. In twin pair studies, we found that CHGA traits aggregated with body mass index (BMI), as well as its biochemical determinant leptin. METHODS Here we used the twin method to probe the role of heredity in generating such risk traits, and then investigated the role of risk-trait-associated CHGA promoter genetic variation in transfected chromaffin cells. Trait heritability (h(2)) and shared genetic determination among traits (pleiotropy, genetic covariance, \u03c1(G)) were estimated by variance components in twin pairs.\nCHGA, BMI, and leptin each displayed substantial h(2), and the traits also aggregated with several features of the metabolic syndrome (e.g., insulin resistance, blood pressure (BP), hypertension, catecholamines, and C-reactive protein (CRP)). Twin studies demonstrated genetic covariance (pleiotropy, \u03c1(G)) for CHGA, BMI, and leptin with other metabolic traits (insulin resistance, BP, and CRP). We therefore investigated the CHGA locus for mechanisms of codetermination with such metabolic traits. A common functional variant in the human CHGA promoter (G-462A, rs9658634, minor allele frequency ~21%) was associated with leptin and CRP secretion, as well as BMI, especially in women; marker-on-trait effects on BMI were replicated across twin populations on two continents. In CHGA promoter/luciferase reporter plasmids transfected into chromaffin cells, G-462A alleles differed markedly in reporter expression. The G-462A variant disrupted predicted transcriptional control by a PPAR\u03b3/RXR\u03b1 motif and costimulation by PPAR\u03b3/RXR\u03b1 and their cognate ligands, differentially activated the two alleles. During chromatin immunoprecipitation, endogenous PPAR\u03b3 bound the motif.\nMultiple features of the metabolic syndrome are thus under joint (pleiotropic) genetic determination, with CHGA as one such contributory locus: a common polymorphism in the promoter (G-462A) of CHGA predicts such heritable metabolic traits as BMI and leptin. CHGA promoter variant G-462A was not only associated with such metabolic traits but also disrupted a PPAR\u03b3/RXR\u03b1 motif and responded differentially to characteristic trans-activators of that motif. The results suggest novel links between the catecholaminergic system and risk for the metabolic syndrome as well as systemic hypertension.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: to identify differences in echocardiographic profiles of monochorionic/diamniotic pregnancies with early or mild twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), compared to monochorionic/diamniotic twins affected only by discordant growth or discordant fluid. STUDY DESIGN: retrospective evaluation of sonograms and echocardiograms of twin pregnancies referred for suspected TTTS. RESULTS: 112 monochorionic/diamniotic pairs were studied. 41 did not have/develop TTTS, 61 had Stage I/II TTTS. Ten developed TTTS after initially not meeting criteria. TTTS recipients had a higher rate of venous Doppler or tricuspid inflow abnormalities than purported \"recipients\" in non-TTTS pregnancies (86% vs. 37%, P<0.001). TTTS recipients had shorter tricuspid inflow duration/RR intervals than non-TTTS fetuses (32+/-6% versus 37+/-4%, P<0.001). Logistic regression and recursive partitioning identified shorter tricuspid inflow duration, longer isovolumic relaxation, and ductus venosus abnormality associated with TTTS. CONCLUSION: Diastolic pathology, specifically shorter tricuspid inflow duration, may be considered a hallmark of TTTS distinguishing these pregnancies from other monochorionic/diamniotic twin complications.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the major psychoses, schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD), have traditionally focused on genetic and environmental risk factors, although more recent work has highlighted an additional role for epigenetic processes in mediating susceptibility. Since monozygotic (MZ) twins share a common DNA sequence, their study represents an ideal design for investigating the contribution of epigenetic factors to disease etiology. We performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation on peripheral blood DNA samples obtained from a unique sample of MZ twin pairs discordant for major psychosis. Numerous loci demonstrated disease-associated DNA methylation differences between twins discordant for SZ and BD individually, and together as a combined major psychosis group. Pathway analysis of our top loci highlighted a significant enrichment of epigenetic changes in biological networks and pathways directly relevant to psychiatric disorder and neurodevelopment. The top psychosis-associated, differentially methylated region, significantly hypomethylated in affected twins, was located in the promoter of ST6GALNAC1 overlapping a previously reported rare genomic duplication observed in SZ. The mean DNA methylation difference at this locus was 6%, but there was considerable heterogeneity between families, with some twin pairs showing a 20% difference in methylation. We subsequently assessed this region in an independent sample of postmortem brain tissue from affected individuals and controls, finding marked hypomethylation (>25%) in a subset of psychosis patients. Overall, our data provide further evidence to support a role for DNA methylation differences in mediating phenotypic differences between MZ twins and in the etiology of both SZ and BD.",

    "abstract": "Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) plays a key role in dopamine and estrogen metabolism. Recently, COMT haplotypes rather than the single polymorphism Val158Met have been reported to underlie differences in protein expression by modulating mRNA secondary structure. So far, studies investigating the epigenetic variability of the S-COMT (soluble COMT) promoter region mainly focused on phenotypical aspects, and results have been controversial.\nWe assessed S-COMT promoter methylation in saliva and blood derived DNA with regard to early pre- and postnatal growth as well as to genotype for polymorphisms rs6269, rs4633, and rs4680 (Val158Met) in 20 monozygotic twin pairs (mean age 4 years), who were discordant for intrauterine development due to severe feto-fetal-transfusion syndrome. Methylation levels of two previously reported partially methylated cytosines were determined by the quantitative SIRPH (SNuPE- IP RP HPLC) assay.\nOverall, we observed a high variability of S-COMT promoter methylation, which did not correlate with individual differences in the pre- or postnatal growth pattern. Within the twin pairs however we noted a distinct similarity that could be linked to underlying COMT genotypes. This association was subsequently confirmed in a cohort of 93 unrelated adult controls. Interestingly, 158Val-alleles were found at both ends of the epigenotypical range, which is in accordance with a recently proposed model of COMT haplotypes corresponding to a continuum of phenotypical variability.\nThe strong heritable component of S-COMT promoter methylation found in our study needs to be considered in future approaches that focus on interactions between COMT epigenotype and phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Stability or changes of health behaviours have not been studied in association with incidence of disability pension (DP). The aims were to (1) investigate if stability or changes in health behaviours predict DP due to musculoskeletal diagnosis (MSD), (2) to evaluate if an association exists for DP in general, and (3) after taking familial confounding into account.\nThe study sample was 16,713 like-sexed twin individuals born in Sweden between 1935-1958 (6195 complete twin pairs) who had participated in two surveys 25 years apart, were alive, and not pensioned at the time of the latest survey. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess the associations (hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) between stability and change in health behaviours (physical activity, tobacco and alcohol use, body mass index (BMI)), and number of pain locations collected at two time points 25 years apart and the incidence of DP until 2008.\nDuring the follow-up, 1843 (11%) individuals were granted DP with 747 of these due to MSD. A higher proportion of women were granted DP than men. Increase in BMI and stable use of tobacco products were predictors for DP due to MSD (HR 1.21-1.48) and DP in general (HR 1.10-1.41). The stability in the frequency of physical activity and increased frequency of physical activity were protective factors for DP due to MSD only when accounting for familial confounding. However, the number of pain locations (stability, increase, or decrease) was the strongest predictor for future DP due to MSD (HR 3.69, CI 2.99-4.56) and DP in general (HR 2.15, CI 1.92-2.42). In discordant pair analysis, the HRs for pain were lower, indicating potential familial confounding.\nHealth behaviours in adulthood, including an increase in pain locations were associated with the incidence of DP. The association between physical activity and DP was especially related to adulthood choices or habits, i.e., the individual decision about frequency of exercising. Thus, it is important to e.g. increase public awareness of the potential beneficial effects of exercise throughout life to avoid permanent exclusion from the labour market for medical reasons.",

However, the number of pain locations (stability, increase, or decrease) was the strongest predictor for future DP due to MSD (HR 3.69, CI 2.99-4.56) and DP in general (HR 2.15, CI 1.92-2.42). In discordant pair analysis, the HRs for pain were lower, indicating potential familial confounding.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex encephalitis is an infrequent infection with high mortality and morbidity. Antiviral therapies decrease mortality but long term sequelae are still high, so early diagnosis is important for opportune treatment. We present a pair of twins with central nervous system herpes simplex infection during the first month of life. Both twins presented non-specific symptoms and consulted with 48 hours apart needing intensive care admission, the first one for noninvasive mechanical ventilation and the second for hemodynamic support. Diagnosis was made by cerebrospinal fluid PCR, in the first twin at day 9 of disease and in the second at admission. Both twins were treated with acyclovir, but only the second one at the beginning of her illness. Initial study with electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance was normal and cerebrospinal fluid on day 18 of treatment was negative for herpes simplex virus DNA detection in both patients.",

    "abstract": "We identified four cases of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) in one Utah family, originally from Southwestern Mexico. The index cases were twin girls born at 35 weeks gestation, in whom the combination of hyperbilirubinemia, reticulocytosis and elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) led to studies that confirmed the diagnosis of HS. Scleral icterus in their 4-year-old sibling and in their mother led to the diagnosis of HS in them as well. Although much less commonly reported in Hispanic neonates than in those of Northern European ancestry, HS does occur among Hispanic neonates and can contribute to significant neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. These cases are consistent with our earlier report, which identified an MCHC cutoff of >36 as suggestive of further evaluation for HS.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to use a fixed reference to study movement (displacement) of the cervical internal os from the second to the third trimester in singletons and twins. The rationale was to gain insight into anatomic changes associated with cervical shortening.\nFor each patient, 2 transperineal scans were performed 12 weeks apart (20 and 32 weeks). The internal os and symphysis pubis were visualized in the same field of view. Image registration techniques were used to align the 2 scans using the symphysis as a fixed reference. Total displacement, anterior displacement, and inferior displacement of the internal os were measured. Displacements were correlated with cervical shortening. Bland-Altman plots and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated.\nA total of 42 healthy participants were studied: 28 with singletons and 14 with twins. The mean \u00b1 SD values for total displacement were 2.1 \u00b1 1.2 and 2.0 \u00b1 1.2 cm for singletons and twins, respectively (P = .75). The direction of displacement was significantly different. The mean anterior displacement was 1.1 cm greater for singletons than for twins (95% confidence interval, 0.29-2.0 cm, P = .01). Mean inferior displacement was 1.3 cm greater for twins than for singletons (95% confidence interval, 2.2-0.1 cm; P = .03). Only inferior displacement correlated with cervical shortening (P < .001; R(2) = 0.74). For every 2.2 cm of inferior displacement, the cervix shortened 1.0 cm. Assessments of reliability showed good agreement between 2 observers.\nThe anatomic position of the internal cervical os depends on gestational age and fetal number. Cervical shortening correlated most strongly with inferior displacement.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 16% of twin gestations have discordance of at least 20%. We identified 14 risk factors for divergent growth that can be categorized as maternal, fetal, or placental. Determination of chorionicity and serial ultrasound evaluation with a high index of suspicion for divergent growth is required for the diagnosis and stratification of risk. The highest reported likelihood ratio for detection of discordance was 5.9 during the first trimester examination and 6.0 for the second trimester. Although our ability to identify discordant twins is limited, once suspected and at viable gestational age, these pregnancies should have antepartum testing. Discordant growth alone is not an indication for preterm birth. Although there are multiple publications on the increased morbidity and mortality rates with discordant growth, there is a paucity of reports on how to manage them optimally and deliver them in a timely manner.",

Prenatal ultrasound and echocardiography, delivery details, postnatal follow-up, surgical separation and post mortem data were reviewed. The twins were classified according to the type of fusion between fetal structures. The following data were analyzed: ultrasound and echocardiographic findings, antenatal lethality and possibility of surgical separation, delivery details and survival rates.\nForty cases of conjoined twins were included in the study. There were 72.5% cases of thoracophagus, 12.5% of paraphagus, 7.5% of omphalo-ischiophagus, 5.0% of omphalophagus, and 2.5% of cephalophagus. Judicial termination of pregnancy was requested in 58.8% of the cases. Cesarean section was performed in all cases in which pregnancy was not terminated. The mean gestational age at delivery was 35 weeks; all twins were live births with a mean birth weight of 3,860 g and 88% died postnatally. Ten percent of the live borns were submitted to surgical separation with a 60% survival rate. The total survival rate was 7.5% and postnatal survival was 12%. Antenatal evaluation of lethality and possibility of surgical separation were precise. There were no maternal complications related to delivery.\nConjoined twins present a dismal prognosis mainly related to the complex cardiac fusion present in the majority of cases with thoracic sharing.

    "abstract": "Research has found that patients treated for cancer generally have an increased risk for cognitive problems. However, many studies have focused on cognitive performance of cancer patients under the age of 65 who received chemotherapy treatment. Less studied is the extent to which cancer diagnosis may be associated with cognitive impairment as a late effect for older adults.\nIn this retrospective, co-twin design study, twin pairs 65 years of age and older discordant for cancer were identified from the Swedish Twin Registry. A pair was included if both twins participated in cognitive screening, and the twin with the cancer history was screened at least 3 years after cancer diagnosis and treatment.\nFemale, but not male, survivors of cancer were significantly (odds ratio = 2.42, 95% confidence interval = 1.23-4.74) more likely to exhibit cognitive impairment 3 or more years after cancer diagnosis and treatment as their co-twin without a history of cancer. In particular, risk was higher among survivors of gynecologic cancers (odds ratio = 10.00, 95% confidence interval = 1.28-78.11) and those who had treatments directly or potentially affecting ovarian functioning (odds ratio = 13.00, 95% confidence interval = 1.70-99.36) compared with their respective co-twins.\nThese findings suggest that localized treatments and other cancer-related factors should be explored as determinants that underlie the association between cancer diagnosis and long-term cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Cell division and development are regulated by networks of kinases and phosphatases. In early Drosophila embryogenesis, 13 rapid nuclear divisions take place in a syncytium, requiring fine coordination between cell cycle regulators. The Polo kinase is a conserved, crucial regulator of M-phase. We have recently reported an antagonism between Polo and Greatwall (Gwl), another mitotic kinase, in Drosophila embryos. However, the nature of the pathways linking them remained elusive. We have conducted a comprehensive screen for additional genes functioning with polo and gwl. We uncovered a strong interdependence between Polo and Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) with its B-type subunit Twins (Tws). Reducing the maternal contribution of Polo and PP2A-Tws together is embryonic lethal. We found that Polo and PP2A-Tws collaborate to ensure centrosome attachment to nuclei. While a reduction in Polo activity leads to centrosome detachments observable mostly around prophase, a reduction in PP2A-Tws activity leads to centrosome detachments at mitotic exit, and a reduction in both Polo and PP2A-Tws enhances the frequency of detachments at all stages. Moreover, we show that Gwl antagonizes PP2A-Tws function in both meiosis and mitosis. Our study highlights how proper coordination of mitotic entry and exit is required during embryonic cell cycles and defines important roles for Polo and the Gwl-PP2A-Tws pathway in this process.",

We describe twin monozygotic brothers, both presenting episodes of transitory global amnesia occurring only during attacks of migraine without aura.

Furthermore, a common genetic trait in both the diseases or more probably in a particular subgroup of patients could be hypothesized.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to examine the similarities in effects of exercise training and a hypocaloric diet within overweight female monozygotic twin pairs and to assess differences in twin partners' responses depending on the timing of exercise bouts and main meals. Six previously untrained twin pairs (aged 20-37 years, body fat 35.8\u00b16.3%) performed an identical exercise program (12 bouts endurance and 8 bouts resistance training) and took part in a nutrition counseling program for a period of 28 days. They pursued one identical goal: to lose body weight and fat. Each twin partner was randomly assigned to one of the two intervention groups: \"exercise after dinner\" (A) and \"exercise before dinner\" (B). Subjects followed a hypocaloric diet, supervised by a nutritionist, in free-living conditions. Reductions in body weight, waist and hip circumference, glucose tolerance, mean daily %fat intake, changes in morning resting energy rate and resting metabolic rate showed great variation between twin pairs, but only small variation within twin pairs. Thus, the genetic influence on the changes in most of the examined anthropometric and physiological variables was high. There was no influence of the specific timing on the dependent variables.",

    "abstract": "Twins have been extensively used in economics, sociology, and behavioral genetics to investigate the role of genetic endowments on a broad range of social, demographic, and economic outcomes. However, the focus in these literatures has been distinct.: The economic literature has been primarily concerned with the need to control for unobserved endowments--including as an important subset, genetic endowments--in analyses that attempt to establish the impact of one variable, often schooling, on a variety of economic, demographic, and health outcomes. Behavioral genetic analyses have mostly been concerned with decomposing the variation in the outcomes of interest into genetic, shared environmental, and non-shared environmental components, with recent multivariate analyses investigating the contributions of genes and the environment to the correlation and causation between variables. Despite the fact that twins studies and the recognition of the role of endowments are central to both of these literatures, they have mostly evolved independently. In this paper we develop formally the relationship between the economic and behavioral genetic approaches to the analyses of twins, and we develop an integrative approach that combines the identification of causal effects, which dominates the economic literature, with the decomposition of variances and covariances into genetic and environmental factors that are the primary goal of behavioral genetic approaches. We apply this integrative ACE-beta approach to an illustrative investigation of the impact of schooling on several demographic outcomes such as fertility and nuptiality and health.",

    "abstract": "This case presents a complication of attempted separation of parapagus conjoined twins, related to loss of an intact mesenteric-portal venous axis. Despite known lack of a superior mesenteric artery in the right twin, initial evaluation in the operating room suggested that separation was possible. After hepatic division, however, it became apparent that the mesenteric drainage was not separable; and the operation was aborted. Subsequently, significant growth failure and hypoglycemia were noted in the right twin. The situation was corrected by creating a shunt to reinstitute mesenteric flow to the right twin's liver and separating the twin's mesenteric drainage. One year postoperatively, both twins are independently nourishing themselves and have been free from hospitalization with stable glucoses.",

Schooling may in part be a proxy for unobserved endowments-including family background and genetics-that both are correlated with schooling and have direct causal effects on these outcomes. This study addresses the schooling-health-gradient issue with twins methodology, using rich data from the Danish Twin Registry linked to population-based registries to minimize random and systematic measurement error biases. We find strong, significantly negative associations between schooling and hospitalization and mortality, but generally no causal effects of schooling.",

    "abstract": "Conjoined twins are born when a single fertilized egg partially splits into two fetuses. A hypothetical case of infant conjoined twins from Angel Mounds, a Middle Mississippian site (A.D. 1050-1400) on the Ohio River near Evansville, Indiana, was discovered in 1941. Morphological analysis does not rule out the field interpretation of this double burial as twins. Ancient mitochondrial DNA recovered from both infants demonstrates that they were not maternal relatives, and hence that they cannot have been conjoined twins.",

    "abstract": "Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of cardiovascular risk in adults. Patterns and determinants of CRP in adolescents have not been well described.\nThis study aimed to determine how CRP varies by age, gender, Tanner stage, and body fat composition in rural Chinese adolescents and to what degree adiposity-CRP associations are attributable to shared genetic and environmental factors.\nData were derived from an ongoing study of metabolic syndrome in a large community-based twin cohort enrolled in Anqing, China.\nThe study sample included 1180 adolescent twins aged 13-21 yr.\nPlasma CRP concentrations were measured by sandwich immunoassay using flow metric xMAP technology. Body fat composition was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.\nCRP levels linearly increased across age and Tanner stage in males (P \u2264 0.0001), but in females, CRP exhibited no trend after adjusting for fat mass (P > 0.05). For males, the most explanatory measure was body mass index (partial r(2) = 5.2%), whereas percent body fat (partial r(2) = 8.8%) was more explanatory in females. Of the phenotypic correlations between adiposity measures and CRP (0.25-0.28), 86-89% were attributed to shared genetic factors and 11-14% to common unique environmental factors in both sexes.\nAdiposity is a strong determinant of CRP even in this relatively lean Chinese population. There is notable gender difference for the CRP pattern and the relationship of CRP with adiposity during adolescence. To a large degree, common genetic factors may underlie the observed adiposity-CRP-phenotypic correlations.",

    "abstract": "Monochorionic (MC) twins are at risk for several disorders, including twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), Twin Reverse Arterial Perfusion (TRAP) and selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR). Several fetal interventions, such as serial amnioreduction (AR), fetoscopic laser coagulation of placental anastomoses (FLC) and selective feticide have lead to improved perinatal morbidity and mortality rates. Nevertheless, the rate of cerebral lesions in MC twins after fetal therapy appears to be high. Follow-up studies show a high incidence of cerebral palsy (CP) and neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI). We performed a systematic review on the long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in MC twins with TTTS following AR and FLC and MC twins following selective feticide of the co-twin due to TTTS, TRAP, sIUGR and congenital anomalies.",

    "abstract": "RNases are enzymes that cleave RNAs, resulting in remarkably diverse biological consequences. Many RNases are cytotoxic. In some cases, they attack selectively malignant cells triggering an apoptotic response. A number of eukaryotic and bacterial RNase-based strategies are being developed for use in anticancer and antiviral therapy. However, the physiological functions of these RNases are often poorly understood. This review focuses on the properties of the extracellular RNases from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (barnase) and Bacillus intermedius (binase), the characteristics of their biosynthesis regulation and their physiological role, with an emphasis on the similarities and differences. Barnase and binase can be regarded as molecular twins according to their highly similar structure, physical-chemical and catalytic properties. Nevertheless, the 'life paths' of these enzymes are not the same, as their expression in bacteria is controlled by diverse signals. Binase is predominantly synthesized under phosphate starvation, whereas barnase production is strictly dependent on the multifunctional Spo0A regulator controlling sporulation, biofilm formation and cannibalism. Barnase and binase also have some distinctions in practical applications. Barnase was initially suggested to be useful in research and biotechnology as a tool for studying protein-protein interactions, for RNA elimination from biological samples, for affinity purification of RNase fusion proteins, for the development of cloning vectors and for sterility acquisition by transgenic plants. Binase, as later barnase, was tested for antiviral, antitumour and immunogenic effects. Both RNases have found their own niche in cancer research as a result of success in targeted delivery and selectivity towards tumour cells.",

    "abstract": "The Danish Twin Registry (DTR) has for more than 50 years been based on surveys and clinical investigations and over the two last decades also on register linkage. Currently these two approaches are merged within Statistics Denmark.\nHere we report on three major groups of register-based research in the DTR that used the uniqueness of twinning. First, we focus on the ''long-term prognosis'' of being a twin compared with being a singleton and show that Danish twins have health trajectories in adulthood similar to singletons, which is a result of interest for twins and their families as well as a test of the fetal origins hypothesis that states that fetal growth restriction has long-term health consequences. Secondly, we summarise some of the most important register-based ''classical twin studies'', e.g. heritability studies on lifespan and exceptional longevity. Finally, we illustrate how the co-twin control method in a register setting can be used to control for the effect of rearing environment and genetic factors in studies of the association between exposures and health.\nThe spectrum of register-based twin studies is very wide and have changed in accordance with methodological and data resource developments.",

    "abstract": "We describe trends in the rates of admission of preterm twin and triplet infants to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) across Canada and compare their neonatal outcomes over a 6-year period. Temporal trends of admission rates for 5193 twins and triplets < 33 weeks' gestational age to participating NICUs in the Canadian Neonatal Network between 2003 and 2008 were assessed. Trends in infant outcomes were evaluated using logistic regression. The proportion of twins increased from 26.1 to 28.0 per 100 admissions between 2003 and 2008 (7% increase, p = 0.02). In contrast, the proportion of triplets decreased from 5.0 to 3.3 per 100 admissions (34% reduction, p = 0.04). These trends were significant in mothers \u2265 35 years of age. Neonatal outcomes improved for preterm twins (mortality, p < 0.01; survival without any major morbidity, p < 0.01; severe neurological injury, p = 0.02; and severe retinopathy of prematurity, p = 0.03). Similar improvements were observed for triplets, but the sample size was insufficient to reach statistical significance. The rate of NICU admissions for preterm twins at < 33 weeks' gestation has increased in recent years, whereas for triplets it has gradually declined. Neonatal outcomes of preterm twins improved over the study period.",

    "abstract": "Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) falls within a group of pediatric disorders with both respiratory control and autonomic nervous system dysregulation. Children with ROHHAD typically present after 1.5 years of age with rapid weight gain as the initial sign. Subsequently, they develop alveolar hypoventilation, autonomic nervous system dysregulation, and, if untreated, cardiorespiratory arrest. To our knowledge, this is the first report of discordant presentation of ROHHAD in monozygotic twins. Twin girls, born at term, had concordant growth and development until 8 years of age. From 8 to 12 years of age, the affected twin developed features characteristic of ROHHAD including obesity, alveolar hypoventilation, scoliosis, hypothalamic dysfunction (central diabetes insipidus, hypothyroidism, premature pubarche, and growth hormone deficiency), right paraspinal/thoracic ganglioneuroblastoma, seizures, and autonomic dysregulation including altered pain perception, large and sluggishly reactive pupils, hypothermia, and profound bradycardia that required a cardiac pacemaker. Results of genetic testing for PHOX2B (congenital central hypoventilation syndrome disease-defining gene) mutations were negative. With early recognition and conservative management, the affected twin had excellent neurocognitive outcome that matched that of the unaffected twin. The unaffected twin demonstrated rapid weight gain later in age but not development of signs/symptoms consistent with ROHHAD. This discordant twin pair demonstrates key features of ROHHAD including the importance of early recognition (especially hypoventilation), complexity of signs/symptoms and clinical course, and importance of initiating comprehensive, multispecialty care. These cases confound the hypothesis of a monogenic etiology for ROHHAD and indicate alternative etiologies including autoimmune or epigenetic phenomenon or a combination of genetic predisposition and acquired precipitant.",

If confirmed, this would suggest that antiretroviral therapy might benefit patients suffering from CFS. We validated a set of assays for XMRV and evaluated the prevalence of XMRV in a cohort of monozygotic twins discordant for CFS. Stored peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were tested with 3 separate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (one of which was nested) for XMRV DNA, and serum/plasma was tested for XMRV RNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. None of the PBMC samples from the twins with CFS or their unaffected co-twins was positive for XMRV, by any of the assays. One plasma sample, from an unaffected co-twin, was reproducibly positive by RT-PCR. However, serum from the same day was negative, as was a follow-up plasma sample obtained 2 days after the positive specimen. These data do not support an association of XMRV with CFS.",

    "abstract": "There is paucity of literature on the incidence and clinical associations of transient benign dermatological conditions in twin neonates. This prospective study evaluated 253 live-born twin babies (\u226523 wks) at a tertiary care hospital in Delhi, India. All study subjects were observed for the first 7 days of life, and regular dermatological examination was performed. The primary focus was on palatine Epstein pearls (PEP), milia, erythema toxicum neonatorum (ETN), and physiological skin desquamation (PDS). Zygosity was determined with the help of sex combination of the pairs, chorionicity of the placentae, and seven blood group phenotypes. Chi-square test, Cohen's kappa test, and logistic regression analysis were done. PEP, milia, ETN, and PDS were seen in 88.1%, 83.4%, 2.4%, and 4.3% twin babies, respectively. Preputial Epstein pearls were not seen. Birth order, maternal anemia, route of delivery, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, gestational maturity, birth weight, and presence of intrauterine growth restriction were found to be associated with one or more of the studied skin conditions (p < 0.05), but maternal age, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and sex of the baby did not affect incidence of any (p > 0.05). The intrapair concordance was highly significant (p < 0.001) in mono- and dizygotic twins. PEP and milia were equally common in the evaluated twins as compared to reports in singletons, while ETN and PDS were less common in this twin cohort. Environmental and genetic factors may regulate physiological skin manifestations in newborns.",

    "abstract": "Inability to monitor and self-regulate heightened levels of affect lability and affect intensity is associated with a range of mood, anxiety, and personality disorders, psychosomatic symptoms and socially maladaptive behaviors. Despite the importance of these aspects of affective regulation, there are no twin study data to shed light on the genetic and environmental components of these constructs.\nAffective Lability Scale (ALS) and Affect Intensity Measure (AIM) questionnaires were administered to 796 male twins in the Vietnam Era Twin Registry and subjected to twin and model-fitting analyses. Complete data were available from 182 monozygotic and 119 dizygotic twin pairs.\nBiometrical genetic model-fitting estimates indicated that additive genetic influence accounted for 40% of the variance in affect intensity and 25% of the variance in the ALS subscale assessing anxiety-depression mood shifts. Nonadditive genetic influence was indicated for ALS subscales measuring shifts between normal mood and depression (29%) and anger (27%), respectively. There was negligible evidence of shared environmental influence on affect measures. In contrast, estimates of nonshared environmental influences ranged from 52% to 74%.\nFemale were not included in this study due to the nature of the twin cohort. Data from subjects in a population cohort may not generalize to clinical populations. Measures of environment were not included.\nThese results provide evidence for moderate heritability of affect intensity and specific measures of affect lability. Individual differences in mood regulation may represent phenotypic variation in a core psychobiologic vulnerability (e.g., neurotransmitter systems).",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common herpesvirus establishing lifelong persisting infection, which has been implicated in immunosenescence and mortality in the elderly. Little is known about how and when susceptibility to CMV infection is determined. We measured CMV seroprevalence in two genetically informative cohorts. From the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) we selected long-lived sib-pairs (n=844) and their middle-aged offspring and the offspring's partners (n=1452). From the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins (LSADT) 604 (302 pairs) same-sex monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins aged 73-94 years were included (n=302 pairs). Offspring of the long-lived LLS participants had significantly lower seroprevalence of CMV compared to their partners (offspring: 42% vs. partners: 51%, P=0\u00b7003). Of 372 offspring living with a CMV-positive partner, only 58% were infected. The corresponding number for partners was 71% (P<0\u00b7001). In the LSADT, MZ and DZ twins had high and similar CMV-positive concordance rates (MZ: 90% vs. DZ: 88%, P=0\u00b751) suggesting that shared family environment accounts for the similarity within twin pairs. Our findings suggest that susceptibility to CMV infection--even under continuous within-partnership exposure--appears to be more strongly influenced by early-life environment than by genetic factors and adult environment.",

    "abstract": "Advances in modern neuroimaging in combination with behavioral genetics have allowed neuroscientists to investigate how genetic and environmental factors shape human brain structure and function. Estimating the heritability of brain structure and function via twin studies has become one of the major approaches in studying the genetics of the brain. In a classical twin study, heritability is estimated by computing genetic and phenotypic variation based on the similarity of monozygotic and dizygotic twins. However, heritability has traditionally been measured for univariate, scalar traits, and it is challenging to assess the heritability of a spatial process, such as a pattern of neural activity. In this work, we develop a statistical method to estimate phenotypic variance and covariance at each location in a spatial process, which in turn can be used to estimate the heritability of a spatial dataset. The method is based on a dimensionally-reduced model of spatial variation in paired images, in which adjusted least squares estimates can be used to estimate the key model parameters. The advantage of the proposed method compared to conventional methods such as voxelwise or mean-ROI approaches is demonstrated in both a simulation study and a real data study assessing genetic influence on patterns of brain activity in the visual and motor cortices in response to a simple visuomotor task.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine language levels in twins and singletons born after at least 34 weeks gestation and without identifiable neurological abnormality and to evaluate whether in vitro fertilization (IVF) affects language development in twin pregnancies.\nA prospective study of a large cohort of all children born between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2003 was carried out at Gazi University Hospital. All live-born twin pairs in which both twins survived were identified, and a comparable sample of families with pairs of singletons were chosen. The Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale Form and the translated Turkish form of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test were completed at 60 months.\nEven after excluding the most premature twins and those with diagnosable neurological damage, twins performed worse than singletons on language development tests. Twin girls had better scores than twin boys. A statistically significant difference was found between the scores of term and preterm twins. No significant difference was noted when compared according to birth order. Appropriate for gestational age (AGA) twins did better than small for gestational age (SGA) twins in the test scores. All twin girls did not differ from singleton girls, but all twin boys performed worse than singleton boys. Term twins had similar results with term singletons, but preterm twins had lower scores than preterm singletons. SGA singletons had better scores than SGA twins, while AGA twins and singletons did not differ. When the children were compared with regard to method of conception, IVF children had significantly lower scores on the tests than those in the spontaneous conception group.\nIt is hoped that the present findings could lead to a more precise assessment of children for speech impairment and, above all, to more efficient preventive intervention. Whatever mechanisms are involved, the present results indicate that twins born as a result of IVF, are at a disadvantage in terms of language development in comparison with spontaneously conceived twins.",

    "abstract": "Mirror-imaging of arachnoid cysts (ACs) in monozygotic twins (MZ) is extremely rare. We describe a pair of MZ who developed mirror-imaging of ACs in the temporal fossas, and we also review the literature. Brain computer tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the MZ revealed mirror-imaging of vast lesions of cerebrospinal fluid intensity in their temporal fossas. This is the second ever report of such a case according to the available literature. Unlike the prior case, our patients were 14 months, which is a much younger age than the patients of the previous report. Consequently, our case is better in supporting a genetic origin in the pathogenesis of AC. The findings in our case indicate that early neuroimaging is mandatory in the counterpart of the symptomatic patient with AC, irrespective of the absence of symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal copy number association studies in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using blood DNA have so far been inconclusive. We employed genome-wide screening to look for copy number imbalances (CNIs) between blood and hair DNA from three ALS-discordant monozygotic twin pairs and two phenotypically normal monozygotic twin pairs. Genome-wide chromosomal copy number was estimated using AffyMetrix 6.0 GeneChips. CNIs were sought both between twin pairs and between blood and hair DNA from the same individuals. Two blood CNIs were found in one ALS-discordant twin pair. In another ALS-discordant twin pair, seven hair CNIs were detected. CNIs were also found between blood and hair in three individuals. Imbalances in blood copy number appear to be rare in monozygotic twin pairs, but hair may harbour more CNIs than blood. Copy number differences between blood and hair from the same individuals appear to be common. Since brain and hair share a common ectodermal origin, hair may be a more suitable tissue than blood to estimate somatic copy number variation in the brain.",

In addition, two non-twin esotropic children and two orthotropic children of the same age were chosen. The differentially expressed proteome obtained was validated in twelve non-twin esotropic children and eighteen orthotropic children and compared to the protein database.\nWe detected four differentially expressed proteins in monozygotic twins with discordance of congenital esotropic phenotypes. The corresponding molecular weights were 4,146 Da, 4,801 Da, 7,786 Da, and 5,859 Da, respectively. Among these 4 proteins, the first three proteins were down-regulated and the last was upregulated. The initial characterization of these detected proteins via protein library revealed that their characteristics were similar to those of the glucagon precursor, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), camp-dependent protein kinase inhibitor \u03b1, and anti-metastasis gene (antigen), respectively.\nThere were differentially expressed proteins between monozygotic twins with discordance of congenital esotropic phenotypes and normal children. These differentially expressed proteins were mainly down-regulated in the strabismus patients and may be involved in the occurrence and development of congenital esotropia.",

    "abstract": "Low birth weight is associated with type 2 diabetes, which to some extent may be mediated via abdominal adiposity and insulin resistance. Fetal growth velocity is high during the third trimester, constituting a potential critical window for organ programming. Intra-pair differences among monozygotic twins are instrumental in determining nongenetic associations between early environment and adult metabolic phenotype.\nOur objective was to investigate the relationship between size at birth and third-trimester growth velocity on adult body composition and glucose metabolism using intra-pair differences in young healthy twins.\nFifty-eight healthy twins (42 monozygotic/16 dizygotic) aged 18-24 yr participated. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. Whole-body fat was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan, whereas abdominal visceral and sc fat (L1-L4) were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Third-trimester growth velocity was determined by repeated ultrasound examinations.\nSize at birth was nongenetically inversely associated with adult visceral and sc fat accumulation but unrelated to adult insulin action. In contrast, fetal growth velocity during third trimester was not associated with adult visceral or sc fat accumulation. Interestingly, third-trimester growth was associated with insulin action in a paradoxical inverse manner.\nAbdominal adiposity including accumulation of both sc and visceral fat may constitute primary nongenetic factors associated with low birth weight and reduced fetal growth before the third trimester. Reduced fetal growth during vs. before the third trimester may define distinct adult trajectories of metabolic and anthropometric characteristics influencing risk of developing type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is a life-threatening injury with a high mortality rate. Most ASDH cases are a result of trauma; nontraumatic causes are relatively rare with an incidence rate of 3% to 5%. We report an unusual series of 2 patients, identical twins, who had nontraumatic subdural hematomas 1 year apart, one at age 15 and the other at age 16. METHODS (CASE PRESENTATIONS): Identical twin brothers presented 1 year and 10 days apart to an academic medical center after incurring confusion, decreased mental functioning, and a subsequent comatose state. The injuries occurred while the patients were playing football, but there was no evidence of traumatic blow to the head in either brother.\nBoth patients had computed tomographic scans and both underwent emergency surgery for hematoma evacuation. Both patients recovered full neurological function and remained healthy 12 years after surgery.\nAcute spontaneous subdural hematoma is an emergent medical condition that may result in rapid neurological decline and must be addressed in a timely fashion. After evacuation of the hematoma, intracranial pressure decreases and cerebral perfusion pressure increases, which may allow normal perfusion of the brain. Consequently, prompt recognition and evacuation of an ASDH can drastically improve prognosis. Rarely, subdural hematoma can occur without head injury and should be in the differential diagnosis of athletes who rapidly become comatose.",

    "abstract": "Chorionicity is one of the main predictors of higher perinatal mortality in twins. The aim of this large population-based study was to analyse stillbirth and neonatal mortality by cause of death and chorionicity and to quantify the risk of stillbirth by gestational age in dichorionic (DC) and monochorionic (MC) twins.\nWe used data on twin maternities delivered in the North of England from 1998 to 2007 and notified to the Northern Survey of Twin and Multiple Pregnancy. Prospective risk of stillbirth by gestational age at death was calculated using number of stillborn fetuses at or beyond a given gestational period per 1000 fetuses in ongoing pregnancies.\nThere were 4565 twin maternities (9130 twins) with an overall twinning rate of 14.9 per 1000 maternities. The overall stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates in twins during 1998-2007 were 18.0/1000 births and 23.0/1000 live births, respectively. Stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates were significantly higher in MC than DC twins: 44.4 versus 12.2 per 1000 births [relative risk (RR): 3.6; 95% CI: 2.6-5.1], and 32.4 versus 21.4 per 1000 live births (RR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.04-2.2), respectively. There was no significant improvement over time in either stillbirth or neonatal mortality rates in either group. The prospective risk of antepartum stillbirth was higher for MC than DC twins at all preterm gestations and the highest risk was before 28 weeks' gestation.\nMC twins have higher rates of stillbirth and neonatal mortality than DC twins, and rates did not improve over 1998-2007. The prospective risk of antepartum stillbirth is much higher for MC twins at all gestational ages.",

Two weeks later, another ultrasound was performed; two fetuses with a common heart were observed. In 10th week of pregnancy, two fetuses with two hearts and an attached thorax were observed. A diagnosis of thoracopagus was made, and the pregnancy was terminated.\nConjoined twins conceived through assisted reproduction are extremely rare. This case, which occurred after transfer of cleavage-stage embryos, suggests that ovulation induction, ICSI, and assisted hatching may also play roles in addition to other factors commonly proposed to be responsible for conjoined twining, such as in vitro culture condition, culture time, and blastocyst-stage transfer.",

    "abstract": "To date, approximately 35 different POU1F1 mutations have been described in patients with familial and sporadic combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) from different ethnic backgrounds. The majority are missense mutations clustered within the conserved POU-specific and POU-homeo domains, encoded by exons 4 and 6, respectively.\nThis study aimed to identify the molecular basis and clinical characteristics of a Japanese CPHD family with a novel POU1F1 mutation.\nThe POU1F1 gene was sequenced in identical twin brothers with mild CPHD. The mutation identified was also evaluated in family members as well as 188 Japanese controls and then examined in functional studies.\nA novel heterozygous splice site mutation (Ex2 + 1G>T; c.214 + 1G>T) was detected. This mutation was also present in their undiagnosed mother, but not in any of the controls. In vitro splicing studies suggested this mutation to result in an in-frame skipping of exon 2, thus producing an internally deleted protein lacking most of the R2 transactivation subdomain (TAD-R2). Heterologous expression studies of the mutated POU1F1 protein showed only modest reductions in its transactivation activities in HEK293T cells, while acting as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the endogenous activities of POU1F1 in pituitary GH3 cells.\nThis is the first report of a mutation at the exon 2 donor splice site of POU1F1, affecting TAD-R2. The addition of this mutation to the growing list of pathological POU1F1 mutations may provide deeper insights into clinical heterogeneity in the expressions of individual mutations and a better understanding of the structure-function relationships of POU1F1.",

    "abstract": "The course of normal heart formation in the embryo has been known for decades, but little is known about the genes that control its development. To further improve our understanding of the molecular and genetic mechanisms involved in congenital heart disease, we screened for submicroscopic chromosomal aberrations using bacterial artificial chromosome-based array comparative genomic hybridization analysis in two Danish twin pairs, one pair of monozygotic twins with tetralogy of Fallot, and one twin pair of unknown zygosity with pulmonary valve stenosis. We did not find any major chromosome defects, although a number of submicroscopic copy number variations were present. The question of whether these submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances alone or in conjunction with unknown intrauterine factors causes the observed cono-truncal malformations remains unanswered.",

It is unclear whether a similar association exists for dichorionic twins. This objective of this study was to ascertain whether advanced maternal age was associated with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality in a 15 year retrospective review of dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twins delivered at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, a tertiary referral center in London, UK, between 1994 and 2008. In all, 1 174 DCDA deliveries occurred in the study period. Maternal age was not associated with neonatal unit admission or composite fetal and neonatal mortality. Advanced maternal age appeared to have no deleterious effect on the perinatal outcomes of DCDA twin pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether cognitively preserved monozygotic or dizygotic cotwins of persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) exhibit increased brain amyloid accumulation.\nWe performed a cross-sectional carbon-11 labeled 2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole ((11)C)-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET study on 9 monozygotic and 8 dizygotic twin pairs discordant for cognitive impairment as well as on 9 healthy elderly control subjects. (11)C-PiB uptake was analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping and with region of interest analysis with the region-to-cerebellum ratio as a measure of tracer uptake.\nCognitively preserved monozygotic cotwins of cognitively impaired probands had increased cortical (11)C-PiB uptake (117%-121% of control mean) in their temporal and parietal cortices and the posterior cingulate. Cognitively preserved dizygotic subjects did not differ from the controls. Further, the cognitively preserved monozygotic subjects showed similar (11)C-PiB uptake patterns as their cognitively impaired cotwins. The cognitively impaired subjects (monozygotic and dizygotic individuals combined) showed typical Alzheimer-like patterns of (11)C-PiB uptake.\nGenetic factors appear to influence the development of Alzheimer-like \u03b2-amyloid plaque pathology. The dissociation between cognitive impairment and brain \u03b2-amyloidosis in monozygotic twins implies that there may be important environmental/acquired factors that modulate the relationship between brain amyloidosis and neurodegeneration. AD may be detectable in high-risk individuals in its presymptomatic stage with (11)C-PiB PET, but clinical follow-up will be needed to confirm this.",

    "abstract": "Earlier studies have shown variation among experimental attempts to establish whether human monozygotic twins that are genetically identical also have identical individual scents. In none of the cases were the dogs able to distinguish all the individual scents of monozygotic twins living in the same environment if the scents were presented to them separately. Ten specially trained police German Shepherd dogs of three Czech Republic Police Regional Headquarters were used for scent identification in our study. The dogs were supposed to match scents of two monozygotic pairs (5 and 7 years old) and two dizygotic twin pairs (8 and 13 years old). Scents were collected on cotton squares stored in glass jars. Dog handlers were blind to the experiment details. In each trial (line-up), one scent was used as a starting scent and the dog was then sent to determine if any of the 7 presented glass jars contained a matching scent. Scents of children of similar ages were used as distractors. In the matching procedure, the dogs matched correctly the scent of one twin with the other, as well as two scents collected from every single identical and non-identical twin to prove their efficacy and likewise, the presence of the matching twin scent in any given glass jar. All dogs in all trials distinguished correctly the scents of identical as well as non-identical twins. All dogs similarly matched positively two scents collected from the same individuals. Our findings indicated that specially trained German Shepherd dogs are able to distinguish individual scents of identical twins despite the fact that they live in the same environment, eat the same food and even if the scents are not presented to them simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "To test the potential feasibility for studies conducted in twins reared apart and together from the Chinese National Twin Registry (CNTR) and to answer the question whether the rearing environment affects chronic disease risk factors.\nThe samples were composed of twins from two sub-registries, which included 503 twin pairs in Lishui and 505 twin pairs in Qingdao.\nThere was a big difference in the rates of twins reared apart in different areas (from 0.6% in Qingdao to 5.4% in Lishui). Only nine pairs of dizygotic twins reared apart in Lishui were recruited. The intraclass correlation coefficients for many indices were not significant. Rearing environment might affect diastolic blood pressure and smoking behavior, but it was hard to interpret its impacts in systolic blood pressure, body mass index, waist-hip ratio and drinking behavior.\nThe design of twins reared apart is a valuable study and can be conducted in the CNTR, but the current sample size is still a big issue which requires the registry to recruit more twins to support it.",

Primary outcomes include macrosomia (birthweight for gestational age > 90th percentile), congenital anomalies, low 5-min Apgar score (< 4) and neonatal death.\nDiabetes in pregnancy was associated with a similarly increased risk of congenital anomalies (adjusted odds ratios 1.52 vs. 1.59) and smaller increased risks of preterm birth (adjusted odds ratios 1.27 vs. 1.49) and macrosomia (adjusted odds ratios 1.38 vs. 2.03) in twins vs. singletons, but reduced risks of low 5-min Apgar score (adjusted odds ratio 0.74) and neonatal death (adjusted odds ratio 0.76) in twins but not singletons.\nDiabetes in pregnancy may differentially affect neonatal outcomes in twins and singletons, indicating a need for further studies to differentiate the effects by clinical subtypes of diabetes in pregnancy, and to consider/evaluate differential clinical management protocols of diabetes in multiple vs. singleton pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that social contact is related to similarities in weight gain over time. However, no studies have examined this effect in a twin design, in which genetic and other environmental effects can also be estimated.\nWe determined whether the frequency of social contact is associated with similarity in weight change from young adulthood (mean age: 20 y) to middle age (mean age: 41 y) in twins and quantified the percentage of variance in weight change attributable to social contact, genetic factors, and other environmental influences.\nParticipants were 1966 monozygotic and 1529 dizygotic male twin pairs from the Vietnam-Era Twin Registry. Regression models tested whether frequency of social contact and zygosity predicted twin pair similarity in body mass index (BMI) change and weight change. Twin modeling was used to partition the percentage variance attributable to social contact, genetic, and other environmental effects.\nTwins gained an average of 3.99 BMI units, or 13.23 kg (29.11 lb), over 21 y. In regression models, both zygosity (P < 0.001) and degree of social contact (P < 0.02) significantly predicted twin pair similarity in BMI change. In twin modeling, social contact between twins contributed 16% of the variance in BMI change (P < 0.001), whereas genetic factors contributed 42%, with no effect of additional shared environmental factors (1%). Similar results were obtained for weight change.\nFrequency of social contact significantly predicted twin pair similarity in BMI and weight change over 21 y, independent of zygosity and other shared environmental influences.",

    "abstract": "Chronic exertional compartment syndrome and medial tibial stress syndrome are uncommon conditions that affect long-distance runners or players involved in team sports that require extensive running. We report 2 cases of bilateral chronic exertional compartment syndrome, with medial tibial stress syndrome in identical twins diagnosed with the use of a Kodiag monitor (B. Braun Medical, Sheffield, United Kingdom) fulfilling the modified diagnostic criteria for chronic exertional compartment syndrome as described by Pedowitz et al, which includes: (1) pre-exercise compartment pressure level >15 mm Hg; (2) 1 minute post-exercise pressure >30 mm Hg; and (3) 5 minutes post-exercise pressure >20 mm Hg in the presence of clinical features. Both patients were treated with bilateral anterior fasciotomies through minimal incision and deep posterior fasciotomies with tibial periosteal stripping performed through longer anteromedial incisions under direct vision followed by intensive physiotherapy resulting in complete symptomatic recovery. The etiology of chronic exertional compartment syndrome is not fully understood, but it is postulated abnormal increases in intramuscular pressure during exercise impair local perfusion, causing ischemic muscle pain. No familial predisposition has been reported to date. However, some authors have found that no significant difference exists in the relative perfusion, in patients, diagnosed with chronic exertional compartment syndrome. Magnetic resonance images of affected compartments have indicated that the pain is not due to ischemia, but rather from a disproportionate oxygen supply versus demand. We believe this is the first report of chronic exertional compartment syndrome with medial tibial stress syndrome in twins, raising the question of whether there is a genetic predisposition to the causation of these conditions.",

    "abstract": "To examine if assessment of ductus venosus (DV) flow, crown-rump length (CRL) and nuchal translucency (NT) thickness can predict the discordance in birth weight in monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancies resulting in two live births.\nIn this prospective study, we assessed CRL, NT and DV flow at 11(+0)-13(+6) weeks' gestation in 326 MC twin pregnancies. The study population included 237 pregnancies without major abnormalities or prenatal interventions resulting in two live births. We examined the value of DV flow and discordance in NT and CRL in the prediction of discordance in birth weight.\nIn the 237 MC twin pregnancies the median discordance in birth weight was 8.0% (range 0-42.2%). There was no significant association between discordance in either CRL or NT and discordance in birth weight (P=0.116 and P=0.332). In pregnancies with abnormal DV flow in at least one of the fetuses the median discordance in birth weight was higher than in those with normal DV flow in both twins (13.2% vs. 7.8%, P=0.006).\nIn uncomplicated MC twin pregnancies, abnormal DV flow in at least one of the fetuses is associated with a higher discordance in birth weight than in those with normal flow in both fetuses.",

    "abstract": "Genetic factors account for 40%-70% of the population variation in body mass index (BMI), suggesting that genetic predisposition is a major risk factor for excess weight. The purpose of this study was to test whether exercise attenuates the inherited risk for excess body weight.\nSurvey questionnaires of exercise (usual running distance) and BMI were obtained from a national sample of 582 female and 344 male self-identified monozygotic (MZ) twins. Regression analyses were used to test whether running disparity diminished the inheritance of BMI when adjusted for age, education, cigarette use, and selected dietary variables.\nThe active twins ran between 0 and 10.7 km \u00b7 d(-1) more than their less active twins if female (mean \u00b1 SD = 1.61 \u00b1 1.50 km \u00b7 d(-1)) and between 0 and 13.7 km \u00b7 d(-1) more if male (1.88 \u00b1 1.78 km \u00b7 d(-1)). Average BMIs of the less active twins were 22.38 \u00b1 3.56 and 24.59 \u00b1 3.08 kg \u00b7 m(-2) in females and males, respectively. Within-twin correlations were significant (P < 0.0001) for usual distance run (females: r = 0.64; males: r = 0.61) and BMI (females: r = 0.67; males: r = 0.71). Greater running differences (\u0394km \u00b7 d(-1)) attenuated the effect of the less active twins' BMIs on their active MZ twins' BMI (females: -14.3% per \u0394km \u00b7 d(-1), P < 10(-7); males: -7.4% per \u0394km \u00b7 d(-1), P = 0.004), such that by 4 \u0394km \u00b7 d(-1), the inherited risk was reduced by 58.8% in females and 29.6% in males.\nThese results are consistent with the attenuation of the inherited risk of excess body weight by running, which is remarkable because BMI regulation is assumed to be multifactorial, its genetic inheritance is polygenic, and no single genetic polymorphism currently explains >1% of the BMI variance.",

    "abstract": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a sporadic disease. Its pathogenesis may involve multiple genetic and nongenetic factors, but its etiology remains largely unknown. We hypothesized that the genome of a patient with MSA would demonstrate copy number variations (CNVs) in the genes or genomic regions of interest. To identify genomic alterations increasing the risk for MSA, we examined a pair of monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for the MSA phenotype and 32 patients with MSA.\nBy whole-genome CNV analysis using a combination of CNV beadchip and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)-based CNV microarrays followed by region-targeting, high-density, custom-made oligonucleotide tiling microarray analysis, we identified disease-specific copy number loss of the (Src homology 2 domain containing)-transforming protein 2 (SHC2) gene in the distal 350-kb subtelomeric region of 19p13.3 in the affected MZ twin and 10 of the 31 patients with MSA but not in 2 independent control populations (p = 1.04 \u00d7 10-8, odds ratio = 89.8, Pearson's chi-square test).\nCopy number loss of SHC2 strongly indicates a causal link to MSA. CNV analysis of phenotypically discordant MZ twins is a powerful tool for identifying disease-predisposing loci. Our results would enable the identification of novel diagnostic measure, therapeutic targets and better understanding of the etiology of MSA.",

The data were analysed using two different multivariate models by the Mx statistical package.\nNo major sex differences were found and thus boys and girls were analysed together. Since 1 year of age, genetic factors explained from 42-71% and environmental factors shared by co-twins from 14-33% of the variation of height. Genetic continuity of height was high and 75% of the genetic variance was shared since 1 year of age. Environmental factors affecting height showed weaker correlations between early and late childhood than genetic factors.\nGrowth from early to late childhood is largely regulated by the same set of genes.
