    "abstract": "A fast and simple method for authenticating raspberry flavors from food products was developed. The two enantiomers of the compound (E)-\u03b1-ionone from raspberry flavor were separated on a chiral gas chromatographic column. Based on the ratio of these two enantiomers, the naturalness of a raspberry flavor can be evaluated due to the fact that a natural flavor will consist almost exclusively of the R enantiomer, while a chemical synthesis of the same compound will result in a racemic mixture. Twenty-seven food products containing raspberry flavors where investigated using SPME-chiral-GC-MS. We found raspberry jam, dried raspberries, and sodas declared to contain natural aroma all contained almost only R-(E)-\u03b1-ionone supporting the content of natural raspberry aroma. Six out of eight sweets tested did not indicate a content of natural aroma on the labeling which was in agreement with the almost equal distribution of the R and S isomer. Two products were labeled to contain natural raspberry flavors but were found to contain almost equal amounts of both enantiomers indicating a presence of synthetic raspberry flavors only. Additionally, two products that were labeled to contain both raspberry juice and flavor showed equal amounts of both enantiomers, indicating the presence of synthetic flavor.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine bioactive components and radical scavenging capacity of black raspberry seed extracts as byproducts obtaining during the juice (FSE) and wine (WSE) making process. Cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside was identified as a major anthocyanin and the total anthocyanin contents of fresh and wine seed were 78.24 and 41.61\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g of dry weight, respectively. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents of FSE and WSE were 2.31\u00a0g gallic acid equivalent (GAE) and 360.95\u00a0mg catechin equivalent (CE), and 2.44\u00a0g GAE and 379.54\u00a0mg CE per 100\u00a0g dry weight, respectively. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values were 1041.9\u00a0\u03bcM TE/g for FSE and 1060.4\u00a0\u03bcM TE/g for WSE. Pretreatment of the FSE and WSE inhibited the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA and protein damage induced by hydroxyl radicals, and Fe(3+)/ascorbic acid-induced lipid peroxidation in a dose dependent manner. WSE more effectively protected from oxidative damage than FSE. Results from the current study suggest that black raspberry seeds as byproducts from juice and wine processing could be potential sources for natural antioxidants.",

    "abstract": "Successful valorisation of raspberry and blueberry pomace was achieved through their application, as dried and ground powders, in the formulation of value-added gluten-free cookies. Simplex-lattice mixture design approach was applied to obtain the product with the best sensory properties, nutritional profile and antioxidant activity. The highest desirability of 90.0\u00a0% was accomplished with the substitution of gluten-free flour mixture with 28.2\u00a0% of blueberry and 1.8\u00a0% of raspberry pomace. The model was verified. Optimized cookies had similar protein (3.72\u00a0%) and carbohydrate (66.7\u00a0%) contents as gluten-containing counterparts used for comparison, but significantly lower fat content (10.97\u00a0%). Daily portion of the optimized cookies meets: 5.00\u00a0% and 7.73\u00a0% of dietary reference intakes (DRIs) for linoleic acid, 23.6\u00a0% and 34.3\u00a0% of DRIs for \u03b1-linolenic acid and 10.3\u00a0% and 15.6\u00a0% of DRIs for dietary fibers, for male and female adults, respectively.

    "abstract": "Ethyl carbamate (EC), a probable human carcinogen, occurs widely in many fermented foods. Previous studies indicated that EC-induced cytotoxicity was associated with oxidative stress. Wild raspberries are rich in polyphenolic compounds, which possess potent antioxidant activity. This study was conducted to investigate the protective effect of wild raspberry extracts produced before (RE) and after in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion (RD) on EC-induced oxidative damage in Caco-2 cells. Our primary data showed that ethyl carbamate could result in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in Caco-2 cells and raspberry extract after digestion (RD) may be more effective than that before digestion (RE) in attenuating toxicity caused by ethyl carbamate. Further investigation by fluorescence microscope revealed that RD may significantly ameliorate EC-induced oxidative damage by scavenging the overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), maintaining mitochondrial function and preventing glutathione (GSH) depletion. In addition, HPLC-ESI-MS results showed that the contents of identified polyphenolic compounds (esculin, kaempferol O-hexoside, and pelargonidin O-hexoside) were remarkably increased after digestion, which might be related to the better protective effect of RD. Overall, our results demonstrated that raspberry extract undergoing simulated gastrointestinal digestion may improve the protective effect against EC-induced oxidative damage in Caco-2 cells.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry pomace is a source of polyphenols, which nutritional and health promoting properties are not sufficiently known. The aim of this 8-weeks study was to scrutinize if raspberry extracts (REs) with different ellagitannins to flavan-3-ols ratios might favorably affect the caecal fermentation processes and blood lipid profile in rats. Forty male Wistar rats were fed with a standard diet or its modification with two types of REs (E1 and E2) characterized by different ratios of ellagitannins to flavan-3-ols (7.7 and 3.1 for E1 and E2, respectively) and added to a diet at two dosages of polyphenolic compounds (0.15 and 0.30% of a diet; L and H treatments, respectively). Irrespective of polyphenols dietary level, both REs reduced the activity of bacterial \u03b2-glucuronidase, increased production of butyric acid in the caecum and reduced triacylglycerols in blood plasma. The E1 treatment at both dosages caused more effective reduction in the concentration of ammonia and elevated acetate level in the caecal digesta than E2. On the other hand, only the E2 treatment lowered value of the atherogenic index when compared with control group. When comparing dosages of REs, a higher one was more potent to reduce the activity of bacterial \u03b2-glucosidase, \u03b2-, \u03b1-galactosidase and lowered value of the HDL profile in plasma. To conclude, REs may favorably modulate the activity of the caecal microbiota and blood lipid profile in rats; however, the intensity of these effects may be related to the dosages of dietary polyphenols and to their profile, e.g., ellagitannins to flavan-3-ols ratio.",

    "abstract": "Black raspberries (BRB) demonstrate potent inhibition of aerodigestive tract carcinogenesis in animal models. However, translational clinical trials evaluating the ability of BRB phytochemicals to impact molecular biomarkers in the oral mucosa remain limited. The present phase 0 study addresses a fundamental question for oral cancer food-based prevention: Do BRB phytochemicals successfully reach the targeted oral tissues and reduce proinflammatory and antiapoptotic gene expression profiles? Patients with biopsy-confirmed oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) administered oral troches containing freeze-dried BRB powder from the time of enrollment to the date of curative intent surgery (13.9 \u00b1 1.27 days). Transcriptional biomarkers were evaluated in patient-matched OSCCs and noninvolved high at-risk mucosa (HARM) for BRB-associated changes. Significant expression differences between baseline OSCC and HARM tissues were confirmed using a panel of genes commonly deregulated during oral carcinogenesis. Following BRB troche administration, the expression of prosurvival genes (AURKA, BIRC5, EGFR) and proinflammatory genes (NFKB1, PTGS2) were significantly reduced. There were no BRB-associated grade 3-4 toxicities or adverse events, and 79.2% (N = 30) of patients successfully completed the study with high levels of compliance (97.2%). The BRB phytochemicals cyanidin-3-rutinoside and cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside were detected in all OSCC tissues analyzed, demonstrating that bioactive components were successfully reaching targeted OSCC tissues. We confirmed that hallmark antiapoptotic and proinflammatory molecular biomarkers were overexpressed in OSCCs and that their gene expression was significantly reduced following BRB troche administration. As these molecular biomarkers are fundamental to oral carcinogenesis and are modifiable, they may represent emerging biomarkers of molecular efficacy for BRB-mediated oral cancer chemoprevention.",

    "abstract": "The combination of NIR photothermal therapy and chemotherapy is considered as the promising technique for future cancer therapy. The key point of this technique is the design and synthesis of photothermal agents with high-efficiency photothermal effects and high chemical drug loading capacity. Herein, submicron-sized raspberry-like hollow-structured polypyrrole microspheres (H-PPy) were facilely prepared through in situ polymerization of pyrrole on monodispersed polystyrene (PS) template microspheres with a diameter of 220 nm, followed by the chemical etching of PS templates. The prepared H-PPy microspheres show rapid and remarkable photothermal effects in water under NIR laser irradiation (808 nm) only for 5 min. Further, a model small molecular drug, (S)-(+)-camptothecin (CPT), was loaded into the void core by a simple dispersion-permeation process through the micro-pores on the raspberry-like PPy shell, with a loading capacity of 0.14 mg/(mg H-PPy). The MTT assay and the in vitro NIR-laser triggered release behavior indicated that pure H-PPy microspheres have good biosafety, but the release of loaded CPT into H-PPy microspheres can be achieved with remarkable spatial/temporal resolution after NIR laser irradiation, which results in excellent synergistic effect of photothermal and chemical ablation on HeLa cells, as proved by fluorescence microscopy. This work provides convenient synthesis of a promising cancer therapy agent with high drug-loading capacity and efficient NIR light photothermal effects, which can perfectly achieve the synergistic NIR photothermal therapy and chemotherapy of PPy microspheres.",

    "abstract": "Bioconversion, i.e., the use of biological systems to perform chemical changes in synthetic or natural compounds in mild conditions, is an attractive tool for the production of novel active or high-value compounds. Plant cells exhibit a vast biochemical potential, being able to transform a range of substances, including pharmaceutical ingredients and industrial by-products, via enzymatic processes. The use of plant cell cultures offers possibilities for contained and optimized production processes which can be applied in industrial scale. Raspberry ketone [4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)butan-2-one] is among the most interesting natural flavor compounds, due to its high demand and significant market value. The biosynthesis of this industrially relevant flavor compound is relatively well characterized, involving the condensation of 4-coumaryl-CoA and malonyl-CoA by Type III polyketide synthase to form a diketide, and the subsequent reduction catalyzed by an NADPH-dependent reductase. Raspberry ketone has been successfully produced by bioconversion using different hosts and precursors to establish more efficient and economical processes. In this work, we studied the effect of overexpressed RiZS1 in tobacco on precursor bioconversion to raspberry ketone. In addition, various wild type plant cell cultures were studied for their capacity to carry out the bioconversion to raspberry ketone using either 4-hydroxybenzalacetone or betuligenol as a substrate. Apparently plant cells possess rather widely distributed reductase activity capable of performing the bioconversion to raspberry ketone using cheap and readily available precursors.",

    "abstract": "Although grape wines have firmly dominated the production and consumption markets of fruit wines, raspberry, strawberry, and mulberry have been utilized to make wines because of their joyful aroma and high contents of polyphenolic phytochemicals and essential fatty acids. However, little is known about aromatic compounds of the wines produced from these three fruits.\nThe aromatic composition of fruit wines produced from raspberry, strawberry, mulberry, and red grape was analyzed by GC-MS. Odor activity values (OAVs) and relative odor contributions (ROCs) were used to estimate the sensory contribution of the aromatic compounds to the overall flavor of the wines.\nIn strawberry, raspberry, and mulberry wines, 27, 30, and 31 odorants were detected, respectively. Alcohols formed the most abundant group, followed by esters and acids. The grape wine contained a wider variety (16 types) of alcohols, and 4-methyl-2-pentanol and 2,3-butanediol were not present in the three fruit wines. The quantity of esters in raspberry (1.54%) and mulberry wines (2.08%) were higher than those of strawberry wine (0.78%), and mulberry wine contained more types of esters. There were no significant differences of acids between the three fruit wines and the control wine. In addition, 2-heptanone, 2-octanone, 2-nonanone, and 2-undecanone were unique to raspberry wine, and nonanal was present only in mulberry wine. The indistinguishable aroma of the three fruit wines was attributed to the dominance of fruity and floral odor components derived from ethyl esters of fatty acids and their contributions to the global aroma of the three fruit wines.\nThe present study demonstrated that there were significant differences in the volatile components of fruit wines made from raspberry, strawberry, and mulberry. The aroma compounds were more abundant in the raspberry and mulberry wines than in the strawberry wine, but the quality of strawberry wine was superior to raspberry and mulberry wines.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry is well known as rich source of antioxidants, such as polyphenols and flavonoids. However, after consumption, the antioxidants are subjected to digestive conditions within the gastrointestinal tract that may result in structural and functional alterations. Our previous study indicated that acrylamide (AA)-induced cytotoxicity was associated with oxidative stress. However, the protective effect of wild raspberry extract produced before and after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion against AA-induced oxidative damage is unclear. In the present study, we found that wild raspberry extract produced after digestion (RD) had a pronounced protective effect against AA-induced cytotoxicity compared with that produced before digestion (RE). Further investigation indicated that RD significantly inhibited AA-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse and glutathione (GSH) depletion. Moreover, LC-MS analysis revealed that wild raspberry underwent gastrointestinal digestion significantly increased the contents of esculin, kaempferol hexoside and pelargonidin hexoside.",

    "abstract": "Due to a relatively high level of codominant inheritance and transferability within and among taxonomic groups, simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are important elements in comparative mapping and delineation of genomic regions associated with traits of economic importance. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are a source of SSRs that can be used to develop markers to facilitate plant breeding and for more basic research across genera and higher plant orders.\nLeaf and meristem tissue from 'Heritage' red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) and 'Bristol' black raspberry (R. occidentalis) were utilized for RNA extraction. After conversion to cDNA and library construction, ESTs were sequenced, quality verified, assembled and scanned for SSRs. \u00a0Primers flanking the SSRs were designed and a subset tested for amplification, polymorphism and transferability across species. ESTs containing SSRs were functionally annotated using the GenBank non-redundant (nr) database and further classified using the gene ontology database.\nTo accelerate development of EST-SSRs in the genus Rubus (Rosaceae), 1149 and 2358 cDNA sequences were generated from red raspberry and black raspberry, respectively. The cDNA sequences were screened using rigorous filtering criteria which resulted in the identification of 121 and 257 SSR loci for red and black raspberry, respectively. Primers were designed from the surrounding sequences resulting in 131 and 288 primer pairs, respectively, as some sequences contained more than one SSR locus. Sequence analysis revealed that the SSR-containing genes span a diversity of functions and share more sequence identity with strawberry genes than with other Rosaceous species.\nThis resource of Rubus-specific, gene-derived markers will facilitate the construction of linkage maps composed of transferable markers for studying and manipulating important traits in this economically important genus.",

The cDNA sequences were screened using rigorous filtering criteria which resulted in the identification of 121 and 257 SSR loci for red and black raspberry, respectively. Primers were designed from the surrounding sequences resulting in 131 and 288 primer pairs, respectively, as some sequences contained more than one SSR locus. Sequence analysis revealed that the SSR-containing genes span a diversity of functions and share more sequence identity with strawberry genes than with other Rosaceous species.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberries, containing ellagitannins and cyanidin-based anthocyanins, were fed to volunteers and metabolites appearing in plasma and urine were analysed by UHPLC-MS. Anthocyanins were not absorbed to any extent with sub nmol/L concentrations of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and a cyanidin-O-glucuronide appearing transiently in plasma. Anthocyanins excreted in urine corresponded to 0.007% of intake. More substantial amounts of phase II metabolites of ferulic acid and isoferulic acid, along with 4'-hydroxyhippuric acid, potentially originating from pH-mediated degradation of cyanidin in the proximal gastrointestinal tract, appeared in urine and also plasma where peak concentrations were attained 1-1.5h after raspberry intake. Excretion of 18 anthocyanin-derived metabolites corresponded to 15.0% of intake, a figure substantially higher than obtained in other anthocyanin feeding studies. Ellagitannins pass from the small to the large intestine where the colonic microbiota mediate their conversion to urolithins A and B which appeared in plasma and were excreted almost exclusively as sulfate and glucuronide metabolites. The urolithin metabolites persisted in the circulatory system and were excreted in urine for much longer periods of time than the anthocyanin metabolites although their overall urinary recovery was lower at 7.0% of intake. It is events originating in the proximal and distal gastrointestinal tract, and subsequent phase II metabolism, that play an important role in the bioavailability of both anthocyanins and ellagitannins and it is their metabolites which appear in the circulatory system, that are key to elucidating the mode of action(s) underlying the protective effects of these compounds on human health.",

    "abstract": "Active silica nanoparticle-based raspberry-like container depots for agents such as antimicrobial substances are presented. The nano raspberry-containers are integrated into coatings in a way that they form a mole-hill structure; i.e., they are partly standing out of the coating. As an application example, it is demonstrated that the containers can be filled with antimicrobially active agents such as nano ZnO or Ag or organic molecules such as thymol. It is demonstrated that the containers can be partly chopped-off via abrasion by rubbing over the surface. This mechanism proves to be an attractive approach to render surfaces refreshable. A first proof of principle for antimicrobial activity of the intact containers in the coatings and the abrasion treated, chopped-off (and thereby reactivated) containers is demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "The Chilean raspberry Rubus geoides Sm. (Rosaceae) is a native species occurring in the Patagonia. Five R. geoides samples were assessed for phenolic content and composition, antioxidant activity, effect on total reduced glutathione (GSH) synthesis and protective effect against H2O2 and methylglyoxal (MGO)-induced stress in epithelial gastric AGS cells. The HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS profiles allowed the tentative identification of 39 phenolics including flavonol glycosides and tannins. R. geoides presented higher total phenolic and flavonoid content than Rubus idaeus. Two out of the five phenolic enriched R. geoides extracts (PEEs) exhibited better antioxidant activity than R. idaeus in the DPPH, FRAP and TEAC assays. A significant cytoprotective activity was observed when AGS cells were pre-incubated with extracts and subsequently challenged with H2O2 or MGO. Treatment with the PEEs increased the intracellular GSH content. R. geoides fruit extracts may induce the activation of intracellular protection mechanisms against oxidative and dicarbonyl-induced stress.",

    "abstract": "Solid male lure dispensers containing methyl eugenol (ME) and raspberry ketone (RK), or mixtures of the lures (ME\u2009+\u2009RK), and dimethyl dichloro-vinyl phosphate (DDVP) were evaluated in area-wide pest management bucket or Jackson traps in commercial papaya (Carica papaya L.) orchards where both oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), and melon fly, Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett), are pests. Captures of B. dorsalis with fresh wafers in Jackson and bucket traps were significantly higher on the basis of ME concentration (Mallet ME [56%] > Mallet MR [31.2%] > Mallet MC [23.1%]). Captures of B. cucurbitae with fresh wafers in Jackson and bucket traps were not different regardless of concentration of RK (Mallet BR [20.1%]\u2009=\u2009Mallet MR [18.3%]\u2009=\u2009Mallet MC [15.9%]). Captures of B. dorsalis with fresh wafers, compared with weathered wafers, were significantly different after week 12; captures of B. cucurbitae were not significantly different after 16\u2009wk. Chemical analyses revealed presence of RK in dispensers in constant amounts throughout the 16-wk trial. Degradation of both ME and DDVP over time was predicted with a high level of confidence by nonlinear asymptotic exponential decay curves. Results provide supportive data to deploy solid ME and RK wafers (with DDVP) in fruit fly traps for detection programs, as is the current practice with solid TML dispensers placed in Jackson traps. Wafers with ME and RK might be used in place of two separate traps for detection of both ME and RK responding fruit flies and could potentially reduce cost of materials and labor by 50%.",

    "abstract": "To demonstrate the bioinformatics capabilities of a low-cost computer, the Raspberry Pi, we present a comparison of the protein-coding gene content of two species in phylum Chlamydiae: Chlamydia trachomatis, a common sexually transmitted infection of humans, and Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila, a recently discovered amoebal endosymbiont. Identifying species-specific proteins and differences in protein families could provide insights into the unique phenotypes of the two species.\nUsing a Raspberry Pi computer, sequence similarity-based protein families were predicted across the two species, C. trachomatis and P. amoebophila, and their members counted. Examples include nine multi-protein families unique to C. trachomatis, 132 multi-protein families unique to P. amoebophila and one family with multiple copies in both. Most families unique to C. trachomatis were polymorphic outer-membrane proteins. Additionally, multiple protein families lacking functional annotation were found.

    "abstract": "Rapid popularity and adaptation of next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches have generated huge volumes of data. High throughput platforms like Illumina HiSeq produce terabytes of raw data that requires quick processing. Quality control of the data is an important component prior to the downstream analyses. To address these issues, we have developed a quality control pipeline, NGS-QCbox that scales up to process hundreds or thousands of samples. Raspberry is an in-house tool, developed in C language utilizing HTSlib (v1.2.1) (http://htslib.org), for computing read/base level statistics. It can be used as stand-alone application and can process both compressed and uncompressed FASTQ format files. NGS-QCbox integrates Raspberry with other open-source tools for alignment (Bowtie2), SNP calling (SAMtools) and other utilities (bedtools) towards analyzing raw NGS data at higher efficiency and in high-throughput manner. The pipeline implements batch processing of jobs using Bpipe (https://github.com/ssadedin/bpipe) in parallel and internally, a fine grained task parallelization utilizing OpenMP. It reports read and base statistics along with genome coverage and variants in a user friendly format. The pipeline developed presents a simple menu driven interface and can be used in either quick or complete mode. In addition, the pipeline in quick mode outperforms in speed against other similar existing QC pipeline/tools. The NGS-QCbox pipeline, Raspberry tool and associated scripts are made available at the URL https://github.com/CEG-ICRISAT/NGS-QCbox and https://github.com/CEG-ICRISAT/Raspberry for rapid quality control analysis of large-scale next generation sequencing (Illumina) data.",

These methods allowed us to identify and quantify the main phytochemicals, obtaining a specific phytochemical fingerprint (phytocomplex). Combined with two different chemometric methods\u00a0-\u00a0clustering analysis and principal component analysis\u00a0-\u00a0the raspberry bud extracts of the different cultivars were efficiently characterized.\nRubus idaeus buds were identified as a rich source of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds: organic acids, vitamins and catechins were found to be the most discriminating variables by chemometric techniques to differentiate raspberry cultivars. In particular, catechins (13.25%) and flavonols (8.71%) were the most important polyphenolic classes, followed by cinnamic and benzoic acids.\nThis study developed a useful tool for R. idaeus extract phytochemical characterization that could be applied also for differentiation and composition control of other herbal preparations. \u00a9 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "abstract": "Numerous medications are used to treat hyperpigmentation. However, several reports have indicated that repeated application of some agents, such as rhododendrol (RD), raspberry ketone (RK) and monobenzone (MB), can be toxic to melanocytes. Although these agents had severe side effects in human trials, no current in vitro methods can predict the safety of such drugs. This study assessed the in vitro effects of five depigmentary compounds including leukoderma-inducing agents. In particular, we determined the effects of different concentrations and exposure times of different depigmentary agents on cell viability and melanogenesis in the presence and absence of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. Concentrations of RD, RK and MB that inhibit melanogenesis are similar to concentrations that are cytotoxic; however, concentrations of rucinol (RC) and AP736 that inhibit melanogenesis are much lower than concentrations that are cytotoxic. Furthermore, the concentrations that cause toxic effects depend on exposure duration, and prolonged exposure to RD, RK and MB had more cytotoxic effects than prolonged exposure to RC and AP736. The cytotoxic effects of RD and RK appear to be mediated by apoptosis due to increased expression of caspase-3 and caspase-8; UVB radiation increased the cytotoxicity of these agents and also increased caspase activity. Our results indicate that different leukoderma-inducing compounds have different effects on the viability of normal epidermal melanocytes and suggest that the in vitro assay used here can be used to predict whether an investigational compound that induces leukoderma may lead to adverse effects in human trials.",

    "abstract": "Sensory evaluation is a critical process in product development and consumer research. It is a fastly growing field due to innovation of novel techniques. The objective of this study was determination of sensory properties of red raspberry extract in fruity flavoured beverages comparison to the synthetic preservatives. For this purpose, an organoleptic stability study on fruity flavoured beverages was conducted storing them at several temperatures (room temperature, 2\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0\u00b0C and 40\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0\u00b0C) in the dark for 3\u00a0months. Sensory quality of beverages was analysed. Difference in pH and data obtained from \u00b0Brix measurements during storage was evaluated statistically. Room temperature and 40\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0\u00b0C were detected to affect sensory characteristics of beverages. Highest variations were observed at 40\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0\u00b0C. Beverages stored at 2\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0\u00b0C displayed most acceptable appearance in organoleptic evaluation and insignificant change occured. It was also found that red raspberry extract provided stable sensory effects, color, flavour and taste, in beverages compared to synthetic preservatives at 2\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0\u00b0C.",

    "abstract": "Yellow Himalayan raspberry, a wild edible fruit, was analyzed for phenolic contents, and antioxidant, antibacterial and antiproliferative activities. Phenolics were extracted using 80\u00a0% aqueous solvents containing methanol, acidic methanol, acetone and acidic acetone. Our analysis revealed that the acidic acetone extracts recovered the highest level of total phenolics (899\u00a0mg GAE/100\u00a0g FW) and flavonoids (433.5\u00a0mg CE/100\u00a0g FW). Free radical scavenging activities (DPPH, ABTS, superoxide and linoleate hydroperoxide radicals) and ferric reducing activity were highest in the acetone and acidic acetone extracts. No metal chelating or antibacterial activity was detected in any of the extracts. Acetone and methanol extracts showed potent antiproliferative activity against human cervical cancer cells (C33A) with an EC50 of inhibition at 5.04 and 4. 9\u00a0mg/ml fruit concentration respectively, while showing no cytotoxicity to normal PBMCs cells. Therefore, the present study concluded that the yellow Himalayan raspberry is a potent source of phytochemicals having super antioxidant and potent antiproliferative activities.",

    "abstract": "Members of the genus Emaravirus, including Raspberry leaf blotch virus (RLBV), are enveloped plant viruses with segmented genomes of negative-strand RNA, although the complete genome complement for any of these viruses is not yet clear. Currently, wheat mosaic virus has the largest emaravirus genome comprising eight RNAs. Previously, we identified five genomic RNAs for RLBV; here, we identify a further three RNAs (RNA6-8). RNA6-8 encode proteins that have clear homologies to one another, but not to any other emaravirus proteins. The proteins self-interacted in yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments, and the P8 protein interacted with the virus nucleocapsid protein (P3) using BiFC. Expression of two of the proteins (P6 and P7) using potato virus X led to an increase in virus titre and symptom severity, suggesting that these proteins may play a role in RLBV pathogenicity; however, using two different tests, RNA silencing suppression activity was not detected for any of the RLBV proteins encoded by RNA2-8.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry-like ZIF-8/PS composite spheres are prepared via dispersion polymerization of styrene with ZIF-8 and PVP as co-stabilizers. PVP is found to be crucial in determining morphology of the final product. It helps adherence of ZIF-8 nanoparticles to PS spheres. It is found that ZIF-8 nanoparticles thus prepared are partially embedded into PS sphere surfaces, resulting in a stable raspberry-like structure. Surface coverage of ZIF-8 can reach up to \u223c32%. The effects of ZIF-8 content and PVP concentration on the particle size and morphology are examined in detail with the mechanisms elucidated. The raspberry-like spheres can be used as a template to grow thick ZIF-8 layers on the PS spheres through subsequent solvothermal treatment, leading to the formation of polymer-core MOF-shell structure.",

Phys. 6, 54 (2004)], wherein discrete surface points are used to achieve fluid-particle coupling. In this paper, we present a follow up to our study of the effectiveness of the raspberry model in reproducing hydrodynamic interactions in the Stokes regime for spheres arranged in a simple-cubic crystal [Fischer et al., J. Chem. Phys. 143, 084107 (2015)]. Here, we consider the accuracy with which the raspberry model is able to reproduce such interactions for particles confined between two parallel plates. To this end, we compare our LB simulation results to established theoretical expressions and finite-element calculations. We show that there is a discrepancy between the translational and rotational mobilities when only surface coupling points are used, as also found in Part I of our joint publication. We demonstrate that adding internal coupling points to the raspberry can be used to correct said discrepancy in confining geometries as well. Finally, we show that the raspberry model accurately reproduces hydrodynamic interactions between a spherical colloid and planar walls up to roughly one LB lattice spacing.",

We show that there is a discrepancy between the translational and rotational mobility reproduced by the simple raspberry model and present a way to numerically remedy this problem by adding internal coupling points.

    "abstract": "The antimicrobial effects of aqueous extracts of blueberry, raspberry, and strawberry on 13 pathogenic bacteria were evaluated. The minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations of the extracts were determined before and after neutralization to pH\u20097.03 \u00b1 0.15. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria were selectively inhibited by the non-neutralized berries. Blueberry was the best inhibitor, and Vibrio and Listeria were the most sensitive bacteria. After neutralization, blueberry affected only Vibrio and Listeria, whereas the antimicrobial activities of raspberry and strawberry were abolished. The total contents of phenolics, flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins in the extracts were measured with colorimetric methods and were highest in strawberry, followed by raspberry, and then blueberry. We also studied the effects of sub-bactericidal concentrations of the three berry extracts on virulence gene expression in Vibrio cholerae. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the three berry extracts effectively repressed the transcription of the tcpA gene. Raspberry also repressed the transcription of the ctxA gene, whereas blueberry and strawberry did not. However, the three berry extracts did not affect the transcription of toxT. These results suggest that the three berry extracts exert potent antimicrobial effects and inhibit the expression of the virulence factors of V. cholerae.",

    "abstract": "Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS) is a well-established optical technique that has been used for non-invasive measurement of blood flow in tissues. Instrumentation for DCS includes a correlation device that computes the temporal intensity autocorrelation of a coherent laser source after it has undergone diffuse scattering through a turbid medium. Typically, the signal acquisition and its autocorrelation are performed by a correlation board. These boards have dedicated hardware to acquire and compute intensity autocorrelations of rapidly varying input signal and usually are quite expensive. Here we show that a Raspberry Pi minicomputer can acquire and store a rapidly varying time-signal with high fidelity. We show that this signal collected by a Raspberry Pi device can be processed numerically to yield intensity autocorrelations well suited for DCS applications. DCS measurements made using the Raspberry Pi device were compared to those acquired using a commercial hardware autocorrelation board to investigate the stability, performance, and accuracy of the data acquired in controlled experiments. This paper represents a first step toward lowering the instrumentation cost of a DCS system and may offer the potential to make DCS become more widely used in biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "A water-soluble polysaccharide namely RCP-II from raspberry fruits was obtained by complex enzyme method followed by successive purification using macroporous resin D4020 and Sephadex G-100 columns. RCP-II was an acidic heteropolysaccharide and the characteristic structure of polysaccharide was determined. The carbohydrate of RCP-II was composed with galacturonic acid, rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, glucose and galactose in a molar ratio of 1.00:0.55:1.19:0.52:0.44:1.90 and the average molecular weight was estimated to be 4013 Da, based on dextran standards. RCP-II presented high scavenging activity toward DPPH\u2022, HO\u2022, O2(\u2022-) in a concentration-dependent manner. The determination of the inhibitory activity on protein glycation showed that in 14 days of incubation the inhibitory ability of RCP-II was more effective on the development of non-enzymatic glycation reaction at early phase than that at the following two phases.",

    "abstract": "Efficacy of R. fruticosus leaves extract in stabilizing sunflower oil during accelerated storage has been studied. Extracts of R. fruticosus were prepared in different solvents which methanolic extract yield with 15.43\u00a0% was higher than water and acetone ones (11.87 and 6.62\u00a0%, respectively). Methanolic extract was chosen to evaluate its thermal stability at 70\u00a0\u00b0C in sunflower oil, due to the highest yield, antioxidant and antiradical potential and also high content of phenolic compounds campared to other solvents. So, different concentrations of methanolic extract (200, 400, 600, 800 and 1,000\u00a0ppm) were added to sunflower oil. BHA and BHT at 200\u00a0ppm served as standards besides the control. Peroxide value (PV) and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) were taken as parameters for evaluation of effectiveness of R. fruticosus leaves extract in stabilization of sunflower oil. Moreover, antioxidant activity index (AAI) of the extract at 120\u00a0\u00b0C at rancimat were conducted. Results from different parameters were in agreement with each other, suggesting the highest efficiency of 1,000\u00a0ppm of the extract followed by BHT, BHA and other concentrations of the extract. Results reveal the R. fruticosus leaves extract to be a potent antioxidant for stabilization of sunflower oil.",

With the aims to simultaneously reduce the surface friction and improve the antibacterial activity of rubber gloves, the synthesized PMMA-SiNPs(TMC) particles were electrostatically deposited onto a sulphur prevulcanized natural rubber (SPNR) latex film. From SEM and AFM analyses, the results showed the highest surface coverage of PMMA-SiNPs(TMC) particles on the surface of SPNR film of 41% and the surface roughness of 69nm. The coated SPNR film exhibited effective antibacterial activity especially against S. aureus. Therefore, this investigation would be useful for fabrication of special gloves with antibacterial properties.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported previously that the systemic efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents is substantially restricted for some cancer types, including malignant melanoma. Therefore, the development of more effective treatment modalities remains a critical, albeit elusive, goal in anticancer therapy. The study presented here evaluates the antitumor activity of raspberry pulp polysaccharides (RPPs) against malignant melanoma using a murine tumor-bearing model. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of this antitumor activity has also been investigated. The results show that while RPP exhibits no direct cytotoxic effect on HT-29, MGC-803, HeLa, Bel-7402, L02 and B16F10 cells in vitro, it does demonstrate a dose-dependent growth inhibition of melanoma in vivo with an inhibition ratio of 59.95% at a dose of 400 mg kg(-1). Besides this, the body weight and spleen index in tumor-bearing mice have also been improved in RPP-treated groups. RPP is also found to induce splenocyte proliferation and is able to upregulate the activity of immune-related enzymes, including acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the spleen of tumor-bearing mice. The levels of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) in the serum of tumor-bearing mice show to be effectively increased upon RPP treatment. Histopathological analyses show that RPP induces tumor tissue necrosis by increasing inflammatory cell infiltration and causes no lesions to liver and kidney tissues. Remarkably, RPP further enhances the antitumor effect of the chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel and alleviates docetaxel-induced liver and kidney lesions in tumor-bearing mice. These findings indicate that RPP exhibits antitumor activity in vivo against malignant melanoma, partly by enhancing the cellular immune response of the host organism. In summary, RPP features critical properties to potentially find use as an immunopotentiating agent or as a chemotherapy adjuvant agent for the treatment of malignant melanoma.",

    "abstract": "We developed a fertilization method in which pollen tubes entered into embryo sacs without any need to contact surrounding female sporophytic cells by using Torenia fournieri (Torenia) plants under the condition of hindering movement of the virus from a stigma, which is the first infection site leading to systemic infection. When RBDV-infected Torenia pollen grains were used for the developed fertilization method, the virus was transmitted to the seeds by pollen tubes germinating from them. On the other hand, no seeds were infected with the virus when Torenia plants were pollinated with healthy Torenia pollen grains in combination with RBDV-infected raspberry pollen grains, which caused the virus infection in the stigma by penetration of their pollen tubes arrested in its style. Our results indicate that vertical transmission of RBDV by pollen occurs in the transport of the virus into embryo sacs by pollen tubes reaching the embryo sacs.",

    "abstract": "Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) has been known to be more bioavailable than cyanidin-3- rutinoside (C3R), the most abundant anthocyanin in black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis). The aim of this study was to enhance the bioavailability of anthocyanins in black raspberry by cleaving L-rhamnose in C3R using crude enzyme extracts (CEEs) from Aspergillus usamii KCTC 6956, A. awamori KCTC 60380, A. niger KCCM 11724, A. oryzae KCCM 12698, and A. kawachii KCCM 32819. The enzyme activities of the CEEs were determined by a spectrophotometric method using rho-nitrophenyl-rhamnopyranoside and rho-nitrophenyl-glucopyranoside. The CEE from A. usamii had the highest \u03b1-L-rhamnosidase activity with 2.73 U/ml at 60\u00b0C, followed by those from A. awamori and A. niger. When bioconversion of C3R to C3G in black raspberry was analyzed by HPLC-DAD, the CEEs from A. usamii and A. awamori hydrolyzed 95.7% and 95.6% of C3R to C3G, respectively, after 2 h incubation. The CEEs from A. kawachii and A. oryzae did not convert C3R to C3G in black raspberry.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone) is marketed on the Internet as a food supplement. The recommended intake is between 100 and 1400 mg per day. The substance is naturally occurring in raspberries (up to 4.3 mg/kg) and is used as a flavouring substance. Toxicological studies on raspberry ketone are limited to acute and subchronic studies in rats. When the lowest recommended daily dose of raspberry ketone (100 mg) as a food supplement is consumed, it is 56 times the established threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) of 1800 \u03bcg/day for Class 1 substances. The margin of safety (MOS) based on a NOAEL of 280 mg/kg bw/day for lower weight gain in rats is 165 at 100 mg and 12 at 1400 mg. The recommended doses are a concern taking into account the TTC and MOS. Investigations of raspberry ketone in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models indicated potential cardiotoxic effects and potential effects on reproduction/development. Taking into account the high intake via supplements, the compound's toxic potential should be clarified with further experimental studies. In UK the pure compound is regarded as novel food requiring authorisation prior to marketing but raspberry ketone is not withdrawn from Internet sites from this country.",

    "abstract": "The plant-parasitic nematode, Pratylenchus penetrans, is a major constraint to red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) production. To determine the impact of P. penetrans on the establishment and productivity of eight raspberry cultivars, R. niveus, and R. leucodermis, plants were grown in fumigated and nonfumigated soil. Then, soil and root populations of P. penetrans and plant productivity (vigor, cane height, biomass, and yield) were monitored over 2 years. In a separate experiment, the role that soil type plays in mediating P. penetrans populations and raspberry establishment was investigated. At 6 and 12 months after planting, population densities of P. penetrans were lower in fumigated than in nonfumigated soil; this trend continued 18 months after planting. All cultivars and R. leucodermis were found to be extremely susceptible to damage caused by P. penetrans. By the end of the experiment, yield was the most sensitive indicator of plant productivity among cultivars, with losses in nonfumigated soil ranging from 63 to 100% of those observed in fumigated soil. However, there was no difference in the productivity of R. niveus plants grown in nonfumigated versus fumigated soils. Results also indicated that the damage potential of P. penetrans was greater on sandy loam versus silt loam soils. The total plant biomass of 'Meeker' raspberry was 46% lower in a sandy loam soil containing P. penetrans compared with soil without P. penetrans; this trend was not observed consistently in a silt loam soil. Despite the fact that soil fumigation is increasingly more limited by regulations, this study shows the utility of fumigation in reducing P. penetrans populations for a sufficient period of time to ensure that newly planted raspberry seedlings can become successfully established.",

    "abstract": "Two plant-tumorigenic strains KFB 330(T) and KFB 335 isolated from galls on raspberry (Rubus idaeus) in Serbia, and a non-pathogenic strain AL51.1 recovered from a cherry plum (Prunus cerasifera) tumor in Poland, were genotypically and phenotypically characterized. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on 16S rDNA placed them within the genus Agrobacterium, with A. nepotum as their closest relative. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on the partial sequences of atpD, glnA, gyrB, recA and rpoB housekeeping genes suggested that these three strains represent a new Agrobacterium species, that clustered with type strains of A. nepotum, A. radiobacter, \"A. fabrum\" and A. pusense. This was further supported by average nucleotide identity values (<92%) between the whole genome sequences of strain KFB 330(T) and related Agrobacterium species. The major cellular fatty acids of the novel strains were 18:1 w7c (72.8-77.87%) and 16:0 (6.82-8.58%). Phenotypic features allowed their differentiation from closely related species. Polyphasic characterization showed that the three strains represent a novel species of the genus Agrobacterium, for which the name Agrobacterium arsenijevicii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of A. arsenijevicii is KFB 330(T) (= CFBP 8308(T) = LMG 28674(T)).",

    "abstract": "The superfamily Curculionoidea is one of the most diverse groups of insects in the world, including many species which are crop pests. Within this group, the native raspberry weevil, Aegorhinus superciliosus (Gu\u00e9rin, 1830), is an important pest in blueberry and raspberry fields in southern South America. Using a 454 sequencing approach, we sequenced and annotated the mitogenome of A. superciliosus, it, providing the first such information for any species in the tribe Aterpini, subfamily Cyclominae. The assembled mitogenome is a circular DNA molecule 15,121bp in length containing all 37 genes normally found in metazoans. Mitogenome organization and transcriptional orientation in A. superciliosus showed the same pattern that characterizes the suborder Polyphaga. Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses supported the monophyly of the tribe Aterpini and the subfamily Cyclominae, recovering this clade in a sister group relationship with Entiminae and Hyperinae. The monophyly of these three subfamilies defines a critical transition to an ectophagous lifestyle in the larvae, from an ancestrally endophagous larval lifestyle in all other lineages. The sequenced mitogenome of A. superciliosus can provide basic data for future studies investigating population history, molecular systematics, stress ecophysiology and phylogeography.",

Effects of diet and RO and their interaction on bacterial activity and metabolite formations in the distal intestine, liver fat and glutathione concentration, plasma lipid profile, transaminase activities, and plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were tested.\nDietary RO decreased plasma alanine and aspartate transaminase activities (43.4 and 157 vs. 25.6 and 115 U/L, respectively; P < 0.05 and P < 0.005) and plasma TNF-\u03b1 and triglyceride concentrations (132 pg/mL and 2.07 mmol/L vs. 86.5 pg/mL and 0.99 mmol/L, respectively; P < 0.05). In livers of the C+RO group, the fat concentration was decreased, whereas the glutathione to glutathione disulfide ratio was increased compared with the C group (30.1% and 6.20 \u03bcmol/g vs. 23.3% and 7.25 \u03bcmol/g, respectively; P \u2264 0.05); however, those differences were not observed between the HF/LF groups (P-interaction < 0.05). In the HF/LF+RO group, the plasma CRP concentration was lower than in the HF/LF group (88.1 vs. 765 pg/mL; P \u2264 0.05) and similar to that in the C and C+RO groups (158 and 128 pg/mL, respectively).\nDietary RO improves plasma lipid profile and liver functions and reduces low-grade systemic inflammation in rats; however, the extent of these beneficial effects is partly dependent on the diet type.",

    "abstract": "Dehydration has been considered as one of the traditional but most effective techniques for perishable fruits. Raspberry powders obtained after dehydration can be added as ingredients into food formulations such as bakery and dairy products. In this study, raspberry powders obtained by hot air drying (HAD), infrared radiation drying (IRD), hot air and explosion puffing drying (HA-EPD), infrared radiation and microwave vacuum drying (IR-MVD) and freeze drying (FD) were compared on physical properties, bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity.\nDrying techniques affected the physical properties, bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of raspberry powders greatly. FD led to significantly higher (P < 0.05) values of water solubility (45.26%), soluble solid (63.46%), hygroscopicity (18.06%), color parameters and anthocyanin retention (60.70%) of raspberry powder compared with other drying methods. However, thermal drying techniques, especially combined drying methods, were superior to FD in final total polyphenol content, total flavonoid content and antioxidant activity. The combined drying methods, especially IR-MVD, showed the highest total polyphenol content (123.22 g GAE kg(-1) dw) and total flavonoid content (0.30 g CAE kg(-1) dw). Additionally, IR-MVD performed better in antioxidant activity retention.\nOverall, combined drying methods, especially IR-MVD, were found to result in better quality of raspberry powders among the thermal drying techniques. IR-MVD could be recommended for use in the drying industry because of its advantages in time saving and nutrient retention.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the influence of microgel composition on phase behavior of binary microgel dispersions using poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels cross-linked with 5 mol% and 1 mol% N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide), or poly(N-isopropylmethacrylamide) microgels cross-linked with 5 mol% N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide). We then explore the dispersion phase behavior in the context of microgel deposition at a planar interface. These results are then compared to the observed assembly of microgels at curved interfaces, in the form of raspberry-like patchy particles (RLPPs) consisting of a polystyrene core surrounded by a (two-component) microgel shell. Results suggest that microgel composition has a large influence on the ability of binary dispersions to coat planar and curved interfaces. In particular, we demonstrate that binary dispersions of microgels containing higher cross-linker content exhibit decreased packing densities that are very pronounced at a curved interface. To enhance packing density we also explore the use of a two-step coating process to fabricate RLPPs with enhanced control over topography. Development of these complex vehicles is potentially beneficial in the modulation of biological systems where spatial and temporal presentation of molecules can have a large influence on cellular behavior.",

    "abstract": "We have constructed a densely populated, saturated genetic linkage map of black raspberry and successfully placed a locus for aphid resistance. Black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis L.) is a high-value crop in the Pacific Northwest of North America with an international marketplace. Few genetic resources are readily available and little improvement has been achieved through breeding efforts to address production challenges involved in growing this crop. Contributing to its lack of improvement is low genetic diversity in elite cultivars and an untapped reservoir of genetic diversity from wild germplasm. In the Pacific Northwest, where most production is centered, the current standard commercial cultivar is highly susceptible to the aphid Amphorophora agathonica Hottes, which is a vector for the Raspberry mosaic virus complex. Infection with the virus complex leads to a rapid decline in plant health resulting in field replacement after only 3-4 growing seasons. Sources of aphid resistance have been identified in wild germplasm and are used to develop mapping populations to study the inheritance of these valuable traits. We have constructed a genetic linkage map using single-nucleotide polymorphism and transferable (primarily simple sequence repeat) markers for F1 population ORUS 4305 consisting of 115 progeny that segregate for aphid resistance. Our linkage map of seven linkage groups representing the seven haploid chromosomes of black raspberry consists of 274 markers on the maternal map and 292 markers on the paternal map including a morphological locus for aphid resistance. This is the first linkage map of black raspberry and will aid in developing markers for marker-assisted breeding, comparative mapping with other Rubus species, and enhancing the black raspberry genome assembly.",

    "abstract": "The extracts produced by multisolvent extraction and subfractionation with preparative liquid chromatography of black raspberry (Rubus coreanus Miquel) cultivated in Gochang, South Korea, were tested for their anti-inflammatory effects. The metabolomic profiling and analysis by orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OLPS-DA) suggested that cyanidin, cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), and cyanidin-3-rutinoside (C3R) were key components for the anti-inflammatory responses in the most active fraction BF3-1, where they were present at 0.44, 1.26, and 0.56 \u03bcg/mg of BF3-1, respectively. Both BF3-1 and mixture of these cyanidins at the same ratio reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced protein level of iNOS expression and suppressed mRNA and protein expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1\u03b2 through inhibiting the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and STAT3 in murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Overall, the results suggested that co-administration of cyanidin, C3G, and C3R is more effective than that of cyanidin alone and that the coexistence of these anthocyanin components in black raspberry plays a vital role in regulating LPS-induced inflammation even at submicromolar concentrations, making it possible to explain the health beneficial activity of its extracts.",

    "abstract": "The genetic disorder known as 'crumbly' fruit is becoming a serious problem in the European raspberry industry. The study set out to examine the crumbly phenotype in a red raspberry mapping population under two environments (field and polytunnel) across six seasons in an effort to understand variability of the syndrome and to examine whether genetic factors were important and if so, whether QTL associated with the phenotype could be identified. This highlighted that seasonal, environmental (field or polytunnel) and genetic factors all influence the condition. Two QTL that are important for the genetic control of the condition have been located on linkage groups one and three, and an association with ripening time has been identified.",

    "abstract": "Biological control agents are a promising alternative to chemical pesticides for plant disease suppression. The main advantage of the natural biocontrol agents, such as antagonistic bacteria compared with chemicals, includes environmental pollution prevention and a decrease of chemical residues in fruits. This study is aimed to evaluate the impact of three Bacillus strains on disease of primocane fruiting raspberry canes caused by Fusarium sambucinum under controlled infection load and uncontrolled environmental factors. Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens were used for biocontrol of plant disease in 2013 and 2014 which differed by environmental conditions. The test suspensions were 10(5) CFU/ml for each bacterial strain. To estimate the effect of biological agents on Fusarium disease, canes were cut at the end of vegetation, and the area of outer and internal lesions was measured. In addition to antagonistic effect, the strains revealed the ability to induce plant resistance comparable with chitosan-based formulation. Under variable ways of cane treatment by bacterial strains, the more effective were B. subtilis and B. licheniformis demonstrating dual biocontrol effect. However, environmental factors were shown to impact the strain biocontrol ability; changes in air temperature and humidity led to the enhanced activity of B. amyloliquefaciens. For the first time, the possibility of replacing chemicals with environmentally benign biological agents for ecologically safe control of the raspberry primocane fruiting disease was shown.",

    "abstract": "The raspberry weevil, Aegorhinus superciliosus (Gu\u00e9rin) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is an economically important pest of blueberry in southern Chile. The digestive protease activity of adult insects was investigated using general and specific substrates and inhibitors. Enzymatic assays demonstrated the presence of trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases. Furthermore, in vitro assays using phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) at 0.01 and 0.1 mM showed percentages of enzymatic inhibition between 0 and 16% for PMSF and 67 to 76% for SBTI, whereas in vivo assays indicated that SBTI caused between 50 and 90% mortality in males and between 80 and 100% in females. Our data indicate the presence of serine proteases and suggest that digestive proteases could be a target for the design and development of strategies to control the raspberry weevil.",

    "abstract": "Black raspberry (BRB) seeds are a major waste product after fruit processing. The seeds are abundant in ellagitannins (ET), a class of hydrolysable tannins, which are hydrolyzed to ellagic acid (EA) and further metabolized to urolithin A (UA) and urolithin B (UB), known to be bioavailable in the colon and the prostate. In this study, the anti-cancer activities of these compounds were evaluated on HT-29 colon cancer cells. ET, EA, UA and UB inhibited the proliferation of the cancer cells. EA caused a slight, but significant cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, and urolithins caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and upregulated p21 expression. Apoptotic cells were detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI assay when treated with the compounds. Disruption in mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspases 8 and 9 suggest that both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways may be involved. Activation of caspase 3 and cleavage of PARP further confirmed the induction of the apoptosis. ET, EA, UA and UB showed anti-cancer activity by arresting the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis on HT-29 human colon cancer cells. This study suggests that the BRB seeds could be a potential source of anti-cancer ET.",

    "abstract": "Playbacks of visual or audio stimuli to wild animals is a widely used experimental tool in behavioral ecology. In many cases, however, playback experiments are constrained by observer limitations such as the time observers can be present, or the accuracy of observation. These problems are particularly apparent when playbacks are triggered by specific events, such as performing a specific behavior, or are targeted to specific individuals. We developed a low-cost automated playback/recording system, using two field-deployable devices: radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and Raspberry Pi micro-computers. This system detects a specific passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag attached to an individual, and subsequently plays back the stimuli, or records audio or visual information. To demonstrate the utility of this system and to test one of its possible applications, we tagged female and male tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) from two box-nesting populations with PIT tags and carried out playbacks of nestling begging calls every time focal females entered the nestbox over a six-hour period. We show that the RFID-Raspberry Pi system presents a versatile, low-cost, field-deployable system that can be adapted for many audio and visual playback purposes. In addition, the set-up does not require programming knowledge, and it easily customized to many other applications, depending on the research questions. Here, we discuss the possible applications and limitations of the system. The low cost and the small learning curve of the RFID-Raspberry Pi system provides a powerful new tool to field biologists.",

    "abstract": "Red Raspberry (Rubus idaeus) is traditionally classified as non-climacteric, and the role of ethylene in fruit ripening is not clear. The available information indicates that the receptacle, a modified stem that supports the drupelets, is involved in ethylene production of ripe fruits. In this study, we report receptacle-related ethylene biosynthesis during the ripening of fruits of cv. Heritage. In addition, the expression pattern of ethylene biosynthesis transcripts was evaluated during the ripening process. The major transcript levels of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (RiACS1) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase (RiACO1) were concomitant with ethylene production, increased total soluble solids (TSS) and decreased titratable acidity (TA) and fruit firmness. Moreover, ethylene biosynthesis and transcript levels of RiACS1 and RiACO1 were higher in the receptacle, sustaining the receptacle's role as a source of ethylene in regulating the ripening of raspberry.",

    "abstract": "Strawberry and raspberry seeds were chemically analyzed and added as dietary ingredients to investigate the physiological response of rats. In both cases the main component was dietary fiber and the main polyphenols were ellagitannins (ET). The strawberry ET were mainly constituted by monomers and a dimer, agrimoniin, whereas raspberry ET were mainly constituted by a dimer, sanguiin-H-6, and a trimer, lambertianin-C. The lower content and the less polymerized structure of strawberry ET resulted in a higher cecal metabolites concentration (mainly nasutin and urolithin-A) in comparison to rats fed diet containing raspberry seeds. Dietary raspberry seeds, a source of dietary fiber, despite being richer in polyphenol compounds, were better utilized in fermentation processes, resulting in enhanced production of short-chain fatty acids. As opposed to strawberry seeds, the treatment with raspberry seeds beneficially improved the atherogenic index of a diet, mainly due to reduced triacylglycerol concentration in the serum.",

    "abstract": "Three forms of confections containing black raspberries (BRB) powder were developed to provide controlled release of phytochemicals for oral disease prevention. Our objective was to investigate the impact of varying confection matrices on the release rate of BRB phytochemicals. Confections were developed and prepared. Textural properties of confections were analyzed, compared and correlated with the release rate of phytochemicals from BRB confections with in vitro dissolution test. In the results, BRB content reached 22% in hard candy and pectin-based confections and 40% in starch-based confections, respectively. Pectin- and starch-based confections retained >93% of its original anthocyanins after processing while hard candy had 59%. Starch confections showed higher G' in rheological analysis and higher hardness but lower cohesiveness and springiness in textural profile analysis than pectin confections (P < 0.05). The confection types showed different microstructure with scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Corresponding to their physicochemical properties, confections showed fast (hard candy), intermediate (pectin confections), and slow (starch confections) release rates with a final releasing time of 90, 150, and 540 min in dissolution studies. Three confections were rated between neither like nor dislike to like slightly (n = 60). Pectin confections had the highest overall acceptance (like slightly) and 62% of subjects rated this type of confection as the most liked ones. These results indicate that delivery matrix could modulate the phytochemical release rate from BRB confection and also influence sensory preference.",

Studies on the isolation and identification of volatile compounds in raspberry fruit (Rubus idaeus L.) are reviewed with a focus on aroma-related compounds. A table is drawn up containing a comprehensive list of the volatile compounds identified so far in raspberry along with main references and quantitative data where available. Two additional tables report the glycosidic bond and enantiomeric distributions of the volatile compounds investigated up to now in raspberry fruit. Studies on the development and evolution of volatile compounds during fruit formation, ripening and senescence, and genetic and environmental influences are also reviewed. Recent investigations showing the potential role of raspberry volatile compounds in cultivar differentiation and fruit resistance to mold disease are reported as well. Finally a summary of research done so far and our vision for future research lines are reported.",

    "abstract": "We report a synthetic approach to produce raspberry-like plasmonic nanostructures with unusually strong magnetic resonances, termed raspberry-like metamolecules (raspberry-MMs). The synthesis based on the surfactant-assisted templated seed-growth method allows for the simultaneous one-step synthesis and assembly of well-insulated gold nanoparticles. The aromatic surfactant used for the syntheses forms a thin protective layer around the nanoparticles, preventing them from touching each other and making it possible to pack discrete nanoparticles at close distances in a single cluster. The resulting isotropic gold nanoparticle clusters (i.e., raspberry-MMs) exhibit unusually broad extinction spectra in the visible and near-IR region. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling showed that the raspberry-MMs support strong magnetic resonances that contribute significantly to the broadband spectra. The strong magnetic scattering was also verified by far-field scattering measurements, which show that in the near-IR region the magnetic dipole resonance can be even stronger than the electric dipole resonance in these raspberry-MMs. Structural parameters such as the size and the number of gold nanoparticles composing raspberry-MMs can be readily tuned in our synthetic method. A series of syntheses with varying structure parameters, along with FDTD modeling and mode analyses of corresponding model structures, showed that the close packing of a large number of metal nanoparticles in raspberry-MMs is responsible for the unusually strong magnetic resonances observed here.",

    "abstract": "Alkylthiolate ligands play dual roles in metal nanoparticles-coated polymer composite catalysts: stabilizer and deactivator. Herein, individual raspberry-like polymer composite spheres coated with gold nanoparticles were separated from each other in the presence of 6-mercaptohexanoic acid or 3-mercaptopropionic acid ligands. Effects of thiolate ligands on the induction time and the catalytic activity of such non-aggregated polymer composites were investigated experimentally and theoretically in the 4-nitrophenol/NaBH4 model reaction from the following aspects: ligand surface coverage, chain order and chain length. With the increase in alkylthiolate surface coverage and chain order on composite particles, the induction time increases first and then decreases, which can be explained based on spontaneous dynamic surface restructuring and electron injection from borohydride ions to the gold nanoparticle surface. The catalytic activity is compromised with the existence of thiolate ligands, but is enhanced with increasing alkylthiolate ligand coverage, which can be ascribed to sulfur-induced electronic charge depletion of the gold nanoparticles. The increment of CH2 in alkylthiolate chains results in the increase of induction time and the decrease of the catalytic activity, which can be attributed to the steric hindrance effect. The reactant addition sequence was also found to affect the induction time and the catalytic activity, which can be partially credited to NaBH4 reductant-induced desorption of thiolate ligands.",

    "abstract": "Second language learners perform worse than native speakers under adverse listening conditions, such as speech in noise (SPIN). No data are available on heritage language speakers' (early naturalistic interrupted learners') ability to perceive SPIN. The current study fills this gap and investigates the perception of Russian speech in multi-talker babble noise by the matched groups of high- and low-proficiency heritage speakers (HSs) and late second language learners of Russian who were native speakers of English. The study includes a control group of Russian native speakers. It manipulates the noise level (high and low), and context cloze probability (high and low). The results of the SPIN task are compared to the tasks testing the control of phonology, AXB discrimination and picture-word discrimination, and lexical knowledge, a word translation task, in the same participants. The increased phonological sensitivity of HSs interacted with their ability to rely on top-down processing in sentence integration, use contextual cues, and build expectancies in the high-noise/high-context condition in a bootstrapping fashion. HSs outperformed oral proficiency-matched late second language learners on SPIN task and two tests of phonological sensitivity. The outcomes of the SPIN experiment support both the early naturalistic advantage and the role of proficiency in HSs. HSs' ability to take advantage of the high-predictability context in the high-noise condition was mitigated by their level of proficiency. Only high-proficiency HSs, but not any other non-native group, took advantage of the high-predictability context that became available with better phonological processing skills in high-noise. The study thus confirms high-proficiency (but not low-proficiency) HSs' nativelike ability to combine bottom-up and top-down cues in processing SPIN.",

    "abstract": "The value of a teaching case repository in radiology training programs is immense. The allocation of resources for putting one together is a complex issue, given the factors that have to be coordinated: hardware, software, infrastructure, administration, and ethics. Costs may be significant and cost-effective solutions are desirable.\nWe chose Medical Imaging Resource Center (MIRC) to build our teaching file. It is offered by RSNA for free. For the hardware, we chose the Raspberry Pi, developed by the Raspberry Foundation: a small control board developed as a low cost computer for schools also used in alternative projects such as robotics and environmental data collection. Its performance and reliability as a file server were unknown to us. For the operational system, we chose Raspbian, a variant of Debian Linux, along with Apache (web server), MySql (database server) and PHP, which enhance the functionality of the server. A USB hub and an external hard drive completed the setup. Installation of software was smooth.\nThe Raspberry Pi was able to handle very well the task of hosting the teaching file repository for our division. Uptime was logged at 100 %, and loading times were similar to other MIRC sites available online. We setup two servers (one for backup), each costing just below $200.00 including external storage and USB hub.\nIt is feasible to run RSNA's MIRC off a low-cost control board (Raspberry Pi). Performance and reliability are comparable to full-size servers for the intended purpose of hosting a teaching file within an intranet environment.",

    "abstract": "A smart city application has been realized and tested. It is a fully remote controlled isle of lamp posts based on new technologies. It has been designed and organized in different hierarchical layers, which perform local activities to physically control the lamp posts and transmit information with another for remote control. Locally, each lamp post uses an electronic card for management and a ZigBee tlc network transmits data to a central control unit, which manages the whole isle. The central unit is realized with a Raspberry-Pi control card due to its good computing performance at very low price. Finally, a WiMAX connection was tested and used to remotely control the smart grid, thus overcoming the distance limitations of commercial Wi-Fi networks. The isle has been realized and tested for some months in the field.",

    "abstract": "We describe the influence of microgel packing on colloidal-phase mediated heteroaggregation using poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and poly(N-isopropylmethacrylamide) microgels with 1% mol or 5% mol N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) cross-linker. This system is uniquely designed to interrogate the influence of microgel structure and stiffness on microgel deformation at a curved interface by elminating the necessity of electrostatic charge pairing. Microgel monomer and cross-linker content is expected to influence deformation at a curved interface. Microgel deformation and swelling were characterized via atomic force microscopy (AFM) and viscometry. A systematic study of colloidal-phase mediated heteroaggregation was performed at varied effective volume fractions with all microgel compositions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and qNano pore translocation experiments were used to asses the microgel coverage on the resultant raspberry-like particles (RLPs). Results reveal that microgel composition has a strong influence on the efficiency (as determined by microgel coverage) of RLP fabrication. The compositional effects appear to be related to the degree of microgel spreading/deformation at the interface, which is coupled to the influence of packing on assembly fidelity. These findings are widely applicable to systems where microgel deformation occurs at a curved interface. We also demonstrate that qNano pore translocation experiments can be used as a high-throughput method to analyze RLP microgel coverage.",

    "abstract": "Polyphenolic compounds (anthocyanins, flavonoid glycosides) in berries prevent the initiation, promotion, and progression of carcinogenesis in rat's digestive tract and esophagus, in part, via anti-inflammatory pathways. Angiogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects of black raspberry extract (BRE) on two organ specific primary human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells, (HIMEC) and human esophageal microvascular endothelial cells (HEMEC), isolated from surgically resected human intestinal and donor discarded esophagus, respectively. HEMEC and HIMEC were stimulated with TNF-\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2 with or without BRE. The anti-inflammatory effects of BRE were assessed based upon COX-2, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 gene and protein expression, PGE2 production, NF\u03baB p65 subunit nuclear translocation as well as endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion. The anti-angiogenic effects of BRE were assessed on cell migration, proliferation and tube formation following VEGF stimulation as well as on activation of Akt, MAPK and JNK signaling pathways. BRE inhibited TNF-\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2-induced NF\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation, PGE2 production, up-regulation of COX-2, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 gene and protein expression and leukocyte binding in HEMEC but not in HIMEC. BRE attenuated VEGF-induced cell migration, proliferation and tube formation in both HEMEC and HIMEC. The anti-angiogenic effect of BRE is mediated by inhibition of Akt, MAPK and JNK phosphorylations. BRE exerted differential anti-inflammatory effects between HEMEC and HIMEC following TNF-\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2 activation whereas demonstrated similar anti-angiogenic effects following VEGF stimulation in both cell lines. These findings may provide more insight into the anti-tumorigenic capacities of BRE in human disease and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Root rot of raspberry (Rubus idaeus), thought to be primarily caused by Phytophthora rubi, is an economically important disease in the western United States. The objectives of this study were to determine which Phytophthora species are involved in root rot, examine the efficacy of different isolation methods (cane, root, and root/soil baiting with young raspberry plants), and determine if pathogenicity, fungicide resistance, and/or genetic variation exists among P. rubi isolates collected from raspberry fields in Washington, Oregon, and California. Of 275 samples, direct isolation from cane material resulted in a greater number of P. rubi isolates (39%), whereas root/soil baiting yielded the least (11%). Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of 210 of the total 597 collected Phytophthora isolates showed that all but one isolate (identified as P. bisheria) were P. rubi. Results of the pathogenicity and fungicide resistance to mefenoxam comparing 14 total isolates from Washington, Oregon, and California showed that isolates were similarly virulent against red raspberry and the EC",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK) is a natural phenolic compound of red raspberry. The dietary intake of RK has been reported to exert anti-obese actions and alter the lipid metabolism in vivo and human studies.\nTo elucidate a possible mechanism for anti-obese actions of RK, the effects of RK on the adipogenic and lipogenic gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes were investigated.\n3T3-L1 maturing pre-adipocytes were treated from day 2 to day 8 of differentiation and mature adipocytes for 24 h on day 12 with 1, 10, 20, and 50 \u03bcM of RK. Triacylglycerols were assessed by spectrophotometry and gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).\nTreatment of adipocytes with RK suppressed adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. RK suppressed the expression of major genes involved in the adipogenesis pathway including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) and CCAAT enhancer binding protein-\u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1), which led to further down-regulation of adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein-2 (aP2). In addition, treatment with 10 \u03bcM of RK also reduced mRNA levels of lipogenic genes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1). In mature adipocytes, RK increased the transcriptional activities of genes involved in lipolysis and the oxidative pathways including adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1B (CPT1B).\nThese findings suggest that RK holds great promise for an herbal medicine with the biological activities altering the lipid metabolism in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",

    "abstract": "The field studies on the residue levels of the fungicides and insecticides used in commercial raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) plantation have been performed. Starting on the first day of harvesting (on June 19), 20 laboratory samples of fruit, 10 laboratory samples of leaves and 4 samples of soil were analyzed and the residue levels were compared to the Maximum Residue Limits (MRL) and Acceptable Daily Intakes (ADI). All analyses were carried out using extraction method and gas chromatography technique. Esfenwalerate (Sumi-alpha 050 EC) and beta-cyfluthrin (Bulldock 025 EC), the insecticides belonging to the group of synthetic pyrethroids, were not found in harvested ripe fruits, while cypermethrin residues (Cyperkill 25 EC) applied on May 24, 25 days later was still found on low levels in fruits (0.026 mg kg(-1)) and in leaves (2.58 mg kg(-1)). In turn, residues of chlorpyrifos (Dursban 480 EC), applied to the soil on May 15 against the cockchafers Melolontha melolontha and Otiorhynchus sp., were found at the level 0.004 mg kg(-1). The content of pesticides in ripe fruits depended mainly on the dose and on the time that has elapsed from the date of their application and were as follows: boscalid -0.950, pyrimethanil -0.917, pyraclostrobin -0.253 cypermethrin -0.026 and chlorpyrifos -0.004 mg kg(-1) while in leaves: boscalid -30.64, pyrimethanil -8.13, pyraclostrobin -15.82, cypermethrin -2.58 and chlorpyrifos -0.15 mg kg(-1). The highest average daily intake was in the case of boscalid, and in fruits and leaves reached the levels 0.205 and 6.63, in total 0.33% and 12.18% of ADI, respectively.",

Analyses of aroma compounds, glycerol, acetic acid and ethanol, as well as the kinetics of fermentation and a sensory evaluation of the wines, were performed. All fermentations with immobilized yeast cells had a shorter lag phase and faster utilization of sugars and ethanol production than those fermented with suspended cells. Slower fermentation kinetics were observed in all the samples that were fermented with strain RC212 (suspended and immobilized) than in samples fermented with strain EC1118. Significantly higher amounts of acetic acid were detected in all samples fermented with strain RC212 than in those fermented with strain EC1118 (0.282 and 0.602\u2009g/l, respectively). Slightly higher amounts of glycerol were observed in samples fermented with strain EC1118 than in those fermented with strain RC212.",

    "abstract": "The plant-parasitic nematode Pratylenchus penetrans is a major constraint to the production of red raspberry. To determine whether several popular raspberry cultivars in Washington State differ in susceptibility to P. penetrans and whether post-plant nematicides treatments are warranted, five independent, multiyear trials were conducted. Trials in existing plantings of 'Cascade Bounty', 'Chemainus', 'Meeker' (two trials), and 'Saanich' raspberry were established in northwest Washington. Treated plots were protected from P. penetrans by applying nematicides over a 3-year period, while nontreated plots received no nematicides. P. penetrans population densities in soil and root samples were assessed spring and fall of each year. In addition, impact of P. penetrans on raspberry yield, fruit composition, cane production, and root biomass was measured several times in each cultivar during the 3-year study. P. penetrans root population densities in nematicide-treated plots were consistently lower than those in nontreated plots at all the samplings. There were few consistent treatment differences in fine root biomass, the preferred feeding sites for P. penetrans. However, a complete root system sampling of one of the cultivars did show greater fine root biomass in treated plants compared with nontreated plants. When differences were observed aboveground, treated plants yielded less than corresponding nontreated plants, indicating that the nematicides may have been phytotoxic to some of the cultivars. This study suggests that post-plant nematicide applications are of limited benefit because, at least during the 3-year time period of this study, there were few observable benefits of protecting these raspberry cultivars from P. penetrans.",

The antioxidant potential of the extract, the cellular antioxidant activity and the effects over neutrophils' oxidative burst were also studied to provide a mechanistic insight for the anti-inflammatory effects observed. The extract was administered in a dose of 15 mg kg(-1), i.p. and significantly inhibited paw oedema formation in the rat. The same dose was administered via i.p. and p.o. routes in the collagen-induced arthritis model in the rat. The extract showed pharmacological activity and was able to significantly reduce the development of clinical signs of arthritis and markedly reduce the degree of bone resorption, soft tissue swelling and osteophyte formation, preventing articular destruction in treated animals.",

    "abstract": "Previous works on staghorn sumac (Rhus hirta) were mostly dedicated to its phytochemical profiles, antioxidant properties, and antidiabetic potentials. This study explored the potential of staghorn-sumac-derived functional ingredients for food and pharmacological applications. Sumac may have other biological functions, such as inhibitory effect on cancerous cells independent of its antioxidant properties. We characterized sumac and raspberry interactions, and their antioxidant capacities (ACs) and their inhibitory effect on both normal and cancerous cells. Mixing sumac and raspberry extracts yielded significantly higher ACs than the sum of sumac and raspberry as evaluated by three in vitro AC assays. However, the potential use of staghorn sumac as a natural source of dietary antioxidant supplement for oxidative-stress-related disorders might be challenged by its cytotoxicity in culturing normal cells. Remarkably, mixing sumac and raspberry showed maximal inhibition of the growth of both rat colon and human breast cancer cells with relatively low cytotoxicity toward normal rat colon and human breast epithelial cells, as compared with sumac or raspberry treatment alone. Sumac-derived products and their synergistic interactions with other food ingredients have great promise as functional food or nutraceutical products that would target cancer cells with minimal toxic effects to normal cells.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to determine the expression of caspase-14, a key protein in maturation of squamous epithelia, in archival malignant and premalignant vulvar squamous lesions and examine in-vitro effects of a black raspberry extract (BRB-E) on a vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) cell line.\nVSCC cell cultures were exposed to different BRB-E concentrations and used to create cell blocks. Immunohistochemistry for caspase-14 was performed on cell block sections, whole tissue sections, and a tissue microarray consisting of normal vulvar skin, lichen sclerosus (LS), classic and differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (cVIN and dVIN respectively), and VSCC.\nLS demonstrated abnormal full thickness (5/11) or absent (1/11) caspase-14 staining. dVIN often showed markedly reduced expression (4/7), and cVIN occasionally demonstrated either absent or reduced caspase-14 (6/22). VSCC predominantly had absent or markedly reduced caspase-14 (26/28). VSCC cell cultures demonstrated a significant increase in caspase-14 (p=0.013) after BRB-E treatment: 7.3% (\u00b12.0%) of untreated cells showed caspase-14 positivity, while 21.3% (\u00b18.9%), 21.7% (\u00b14.8%), and 22.6% (\u00b15.3%) of cells were positive for caspase-14 after treatment with 200, 400, and 800 \u03bcg/mL BRB-E, respectively. Pair-wise comparisons between the treatment groups and the control demonstrated significant differences between no treatment with BRB-E and each of these treatment concentrations (Dunnett's adjusted p-values: 0.024, 0.021, and 0.014, respectively).\nCaspase-14 is frequently decreased in premalignant and malignant vulvar squamous lesions, and is upregulated in VSCC cell culture by BRB-E. BRB-E should be further explored and may ultimately be incorporated in topical preparations.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry juice-milk is an acidic dairy drink (ADD) including two main phases, milk phase (pH: 6.6-6.7) and raspberry juice phase (pH: 3.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1). Due to the low pH in this beverage, milk protein sedimentation is usual problem and therefore hydrocolloid is added as a stabilizer. Thus, in current study the influences of pectin, CMC and Kappa-carrageenan on the stability of the milk-raspberry juice drink and their blend synergistic effect were investigated. For this purpose milk-raspberry juice drink samples were prepared using pure pectin, CMC and Kappa-carrageenan at concentrations of 0.2\u00a0%, 0.3\u00a0% and 0.35\u00a0% respectively. Blends of pectin and Carboxymethylcellulose (ratios of 25:75, 33.4:66.6 and 34.3:65.7) at concentrations of 0.2\u00a0%, 0.3\u00a0% and 0.35\u00a0%, were added during a certain process. Moreover, the stabilization mechanisms were studied using apparent viscosity and sedimentation percent measurements. Based on the findings of the present study, the best fitted samples were the ones containing the blends of pectin and Carboxymethylcellulose which were more stable and viscose than samples including pure Carboxymethylcellulose (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Kappa-carrageenan can not prevent casein agglomeration in raspberry juice-milk individually, but in the presence of CMC or CMC and pectin it produces a stable drink. In general, with utilizing synergistic effect of gum blend we can use lower gum concentration and decrease cost during manufacture.",

    "abstract": "For the development of an intracellular cargo release system with mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN), gold nanoparticles coated with an amyloidogenic protein of \u03b1-synuclein were employed to prepare a protein-mediated nanocomposite into the \"raspberry-type\" particles-on-a-particle (PoP). The PoPs were successfully fabricated only at pH 4.4 by yielding the MSN coverage to 75.3% with 5 nm gold nanoparticles covalently coated with a mutant form of \u03b1-synuclein containing a cysteine residue at the C-terminus. The entrapped cargo of rhodamine 6G was shown to be selectively released from PoPs upon exposure to divalent cations including the \u03b1-synuclein-specific pathophysiological ligand of Ca(2+). Intracellular uptake of the PoPs preloaded with doxorubicin as an anticancer drug and its subsequent Ca(2+)-dependent release were demonstrated with HeLa cells in the presence of intracellular Ca(2+)-regulating agents. Therefore, the fabrication of PoPs with the self-interactive protein of \u03b1-synuclein is expected to serve as a platform technology for preparation of diversified nanocomposites with various nanoparticles and/or bioactive molecules for eventual applications in the areas of theranostics.",

XRD revealed the formation of CuCr2O4 spinel phase, and SEM showed the formation of a 3D raspberry-like structure, composed of 20-50 nm nanoparticles. The raspberry-like particles exhibited excellent catalytic behavior for the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol with H2O2. The influence of reaction parameters were investigated in detail. A benzene conversion of 68.5% with 95% phenol selectivity was achieved at 80 \u00b0C. The catalyst did not show any leaching up to 10 reuses, showing the true heterogeneity of the catalyst. However, significant H2O2 decomposition occurs on the catalyst necessitating its use in 5-fold excess.",

    "abstract": "In February 2013 in coastal California (Santa Cruz County), plantings of red raspberry (Rubus idaeus var. strigosus) exhibited symptoms of a previously undocumented disease. Initial symptoms were small (less than 5 mm wide), angular, water-soaked lesions on leaf and petiole tissues of recently emerged foliage. Lesions were observable from both adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces. As disease progressed, lesions enlarged and coalesced, resulting in significant dark brown to black blighting of the foliage. The foliage of severely affected plants was stunted and wilted. The disease affected 5 ha and incidence was approximately 30%. Cream-colored bacterial colonies were isolated from surface disinfested symptomatic tissue that was macerated and streaked onto King's medium B (KMB) and sucrose peptone agar (SPA). Fungi were not recovered from any tissue that was surface disinfested and placed into acidified potato dextrose agar. Four representative strains were fluorescent on KMB and gram-negative based on lysis by KOH. Strains were positive for levan formation, negative for oxidase and arginine dihydrolase, and did not cause soft rot on potato slices but induced a hypersensitive response in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Samsun); strains thus belonged to Lelliot's LOPAT group 1, P. syringae (3). All four strains had identical DNA fragment-banding patterns generated by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence (rep)-PCR using the BOXA1R primer (4). The pattern generated was different than all P. syringae pathovars in genomospecies 1 including P. syringae pv. syringae. According to multilocus sequence analysis conducted by previously described methods, the strains are most closely related to P. syringae pv. aceris and P. syringae pv. solidagae in genomospecies 1 (1). Potted raspberry plants were used to test four strains for pathogenicity. Inoculum was prepared by growing the bacteria on SPA for 48 h and suspending the bacteria in sterile distilled water (SDW) for a final concentration of approximately 10",

    "abstract": "Taking into account the substantial potential of raspberry processing by-products, pomace extracts from two raspberry cultivars, Meeker and Willamette, were investigated. Total phenolic, flavonoid and anthocyanin contents were determined. Willamette pomace extract (EC\u2085\u2080=0.042 mg/ml) demonstrated stronger 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl DPPH radical-scavenging activity than did Meeker pomace extract (EC\u2085\u2080=0.072 mg/ml). The most pronounced cell growth inhibition effect was obtained in the breast adenocarcinoma cell line, reaching EC50 values of 34.8 and 60.3 \u03bcg/ml for Willamette and Meeker extracts, respectively. Both extracts demonstrated favourable non-tumor/tumor cell growth ratios and potently increased the apoptosis/necrosis ratio in breast adenocarcinoma and cervix carcinoma cells. In reference and wild bacterial strains, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were achieved in a concentration range from 0.29 to 0.59 mg/ml, and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) in a range from 0.39 to 0.78 mg/ml. The results indicate significant antioxidant, antiproliferative, proapoptotic and antibacterial activities of raspberry pomace and favour its use as a functional food ingredient.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we evaluated inhibitory potentials of popularly-consumed berries (bilberry, blueberry, cranberry, elderberry, and raspberry ketones) as herbal supplements on UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 in vitro. We also investigated the potential herb-drug interaction via UGT1A1 inhibition by blueberry in vivo. We demonstrated that these berries had only weak inhibitory effects on the five UGTs. Bilberry and elderberry had no apparent inhibitions. Blueberry weakly inhibited UGT1A1 with an IC50 value of 62.4\u00b14.40 \u03bcg/mL and a Ki value of 53.1 \u03bcg/mL. Blueberry also weakly inhibited UGT2B7 with an IC50 value of 147\u00b111.1 \u03bcg/mL. In addition, cranberry weakly inhibited UGT1A9 activity (IC50=458\u00b149.7 \u03bcg/mL) and raspberry ketones weakly inhibited UGT2B7 activity (IC50=248\u00b128.2 \u03bcg/mL). Among tested berries, blueberry showed the lowest IC50 value in the inhibition of UGT1A1 in vitro. However, the co-administration of blueberry had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its active metabolite, SN-38, which was mainly eliminated via UGT1A1, in vivo. Our data suggests that these five berries are unlikely to cause clinically significant herb-drug interactions mediated via inhibition of UGT enzymes involved in drug metabolism. These findings should enable an understanding of herb-drug interactions for the safe use of popularly-consumed berries.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation and oxidative stress are the key events in carcinogenetic transformation. Black raspberries (BRB) have been demonstrated to have antioxidant, antiinflammatory and anticancer bioactivities. In this study, a concanavalin A induced hepatitis mouse model is used to examine the effect of BRB extract on hepatic injury. Three BRB extracts, including ethanol/H2O extracts (both anthocyanin-contained fraction and nonanthocyanin-contained fraction) and hexane extract were used. The alterations in hepatic histology, apoptosis, and oxidative stress were observed in the animals pretreated with BRB extracts and then challenged by concanavalin A. Results indicate that ethanol/H2O extracts can inhibit Con A induced liver injury. The hepatic protection by the ethanol/H2O BRB extracts is associated with decreases of lipid peroxidation and NDA oxidative damage. Importantly, the BRB extracts increase manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity but not the CuZnSOD. The preservation of MnSOD by BRB extracts is associated with the protective action in the liver challenged by Con A. Ethanol/H2O BRB extracts function as antioxidants, thus demonstrating the critical role of oxidative stress in the Con A induced liver injury, and providing evidence that the protective effects of ethanol/H2O BRB extracts result, at least in part, from their antioxidant action.",

    "abstract": "A series of raspberry-shaped composite microgels were synthesized by the seeded emulsion polymerization of styrene with hydrogel particles. Thermoresponsive microgels of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) cross-linked with N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) acted as cores for the polymerization. During the surfactant-free polymerization, the core microgels shrank at 70 \u00b0C to provide thermoresponsive composite microgels, and the polystyrene particles attached to core microgels became bigger with increasing styrene concentration. Conversely, composite microgels synthesized with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) ([SDS] > 6.5 mM) did not exhibit thermoresponsive deswelling behavior because polystyrene particles covered the core microgels. In particular, polystyrene particles formed composites on the microgel surface as well as inside the microgels when the SDS concentration exceeded a critical value for core microgel swelling at 70 \u00b0C. A mechanism is proposed based on these results for the seeded emulsion polymerization of water-immiscible monomers with microgels.",

    "abstract": "A novel robust hybrid raspberry-like TiO2/PS hollow particles with complex double-shelled structures have been fabricated in large quantities by a facile swelling polymerization approach based on commercially available hollow polystyrene (PS) spheres. The crosslinked-PS protrusions are wedged firmly into the TiO2 shell, making the resultant particles both chemically and mechanically robust. By simply tuning the monomer concentration, the hierarchical morphology (the size and number of protrusion) of the surfaces can be well-controlled. Due to the dual-sized hierarchical morphology, the particulate coating possesses superhydrophobicity (water contact angle \u2248 161\u00b0). Moreover, the well-compartmentalized character is similar to that of typical Janus particles. The special particles with interfacial activity can stabilize water-in-toluene (w/o) emulsions well. Meanwhile, a TiO2 double-shelled hollow sphere with a complex structure is achieved by calcination or solvent treatment. All these unique features derived from a readily available method will endow the products with a broader range of applications.",

    "abstract": "Colour and chemical composition of fruits of 10 red raspberry genotypes grown in Nordic climate during three harvest seasons were studied. The main phenolic compounds in the fruits were ellagitannins and anthocyanins, contributing 57% and 42% to the quantified phenolic compounds, respectively. Cyanidin-3-sophoroside was the most abundant anthocyanin (61%). All quality parameters were significantly affected by genotype. The genotypes could be categorised into three groups. 'Veten' and 'RU984 06038' were characterised by high concentrations of flavonoids, i.e., anthocyanins and quercetin glycosides, and dark red colour. 'Octavia', 'Glen Magna', 'RU004 03067', 'Glen Ample' and 'RU974 07002' were characterised by light colour, high titratable acids and low flavonoid concentrations. 'Malling Hestia', 'RU024 01003' and 'RU004 04095' had high content of dry matter, soluble solids, ascorbic acid and ellagic acid containing compounds, in addition to high hue and chroma values. All quality parameters, except ascorbic acid and lambertianin C, varied significantly between harvest seasons.

    "abstract": "There is currently no standard for the minimum anthocyanin concentration a black raspberry dietary supplement must contain for legal sale in the US. All consumer available black raspberry products (n\u2009=\u200919), packaged as dietary supplements or otherwise prepared (freeze-dried whole and pre-ground powders), were purchased and analyzed for their anthocyanin composition and concentration. Seven of the 19 samples contained no anthocyanins from black raspberry fruit, while three of those seven (without black raspberry fruit) had no anthocyanins of any kind. There was a wide range of anthocyanin concentration within the remaining products (18.1-2,904.8\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g; n\u2009=\u200912). When expressed as per capsule or per \u223c1 teaspoon, concentration ranged from 0.1 to 145.2\u00a0mg (average 28\u00a0mg; n\u2009=\u200912). Until US dietary supplement labeling comes under regulatory oversight similar to food guidelines, foods are a more dependable source for dietary phenolics than supplements.",

    "abstract": "Amphorophora agathonica (Hottes) is the primary vector of aphid-transmitted viruses in red raspberry in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. To better understand the biology of the aphid, we estimated the lower developmental threshold and studied the seasonal activity of A. agathonica in commercial fields in northern Washington state. In addition, we monitored the spread of raspberry viruses (raspberry latent virus and raspberry leaf mottle virus, RLMV) to determine how rapidly fields became infected and whether there was a relationship between aphid presence and infection. The lower developmental threshold of A. agathonica was estimated to be 2.7\u00b0C. In the field, apterous and alate aphid populations began rapidly increasing at \u224d800 growing degree-days and peaked at 1,050 growing degree-days. RLMV spread rapidly, with 30-60% of plants in four different commercial fields testing positive after three growing seasons. There was no discernible relationship between the presence or abundance of aphids based on 10 leaves sampled per plant location, and the odds of that plant becoming infected with RLMV.",

    "abstract": "Black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) has been known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects. However, short-term effects of black raspberry on lipid profiles and vascular endothelial function have not been investigated in patients with metabolic syndrome. Patients with metabolic syndrome (n\u2009=\u200977) were prospectively randomized into a group with black raspberry (n\u2009=\u200939, 750\u2009mg/day) and a placebo group (n\u2009=\u200938) during a 12-week follow-up. Lipid profiles, brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (baFMD), and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, C-reactive protein, adiponectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 were measured at the baseline and at the 12-week follow-up.

    "abstract": "The mechanism of action of polyphenolic compounds is attributed to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative properties and their effects on subcellular signal transduction, cell cycle impairment and apoptosis. A raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) fruit extract contains various antioxidant active compounds, particularly ellagic acid (EA); however the exact intracellular mechanism of their action is not fully understood. The aim of the study was to evaluate the antioxidant effect of raspberry extracts, and that of ellagic acid by assessment of the production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) by murine macrophage J774 cells. Raspberry extracts and their active compound EA did not affect or had very minor effects on cell viability. No significant difference in the ROS generation in arachidonic acid stimulated macrophages was determined for raspberry extracts and EA whereas in the phorbol-12 myristate-13 acetate model ROS generation was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced. Our observation that raspberry pomace extracts in vitro reduce ROS production in a J774 macrophage culture suggests that raspberry extract and ellagic acid mediated antioxidant effects may be due to the regulation of NADPH oxidase activity.",

The positively charged polymer particles were prepared from amino-terminated polystyrene (PS-NH2) and amino-terminated 1,2-polybutadiene (PB-NH2). Adsorption of citrate-stabilized Au NPs resulted in three different distribution states of Au NPs in the polymer particles, depending on the glass transition temperature (Tg) and molecular weight of the polymer. The adsorption of Au NPs onto PS-NH2 particles produced raspberry-like composite particle morphologies, while the NPs instead diffused into the PB-NH2 particles, since the Tg of PB-NH2 is below room temperature. The diffusion of Au NPs could be controlled by varying the molecular weight of the PB-NH2 and the diameter of the NPs, and both core-shell and amorphous distributions were successfully achieved.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the chemical composition, identify the bioactive compounds and measure the antioxidant activity present in blackberry, red raspberry, strawberry, sweet cherry and blueberry fruits produced in the subtropical areas of Brazil and to verify that the chemical properties of these fruit are similar when compared to the temperate production zones. Compared with berries and cherries grown in temperate climates, the centesimal composition and physical chemical characteristics found in the Brazilian berries and cherries are in agreement with data from the literature. For the mineral composition, the analyzed fruits presented lower concentrations of P, K, Ca, Mg and Zn and higher levels of Fe. The values found for the bioactive compounds generally fit the ranges reported in the literature with minor differences. The greatest difference was found in relation to ascorbic acid, as all fruits analyzed showed levels well above those found in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Torenia fournieri (Torenia) plants were infected with Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) by pollination with RBDV-infected raspberry pollen grains. The infected raspberry pollen grains germinated on Torenia stigmas, and then the pollen tubes penetrated into the stigma, even though the pollen tubes were arrested in the styles. In whole-mount in situ hybridization of germinating infected raspberry pollen grains, RBDV accumulated in the tips of the pollen tubes. Tissue blot hybridization of Torenia plants pollinated with infected raspberry pollen grains revealed that the first virus infection site leading to systemic infection is the stigma. When infected raspberry pollen grains that had lost germination capacity were pollinated on Torenia stigmas, RBDV could not infect the stigmas, and no horizontal transmission occurred. These results indicate that penetration of pollen tubes with accumulated RBDV into stigmas is essential in causing the first viral infection in the stigma to lead to systemic infection.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this research was to develop advanced lipid nanocarriers based on renewable vegetable resources (rice bran oil and raspberry seed oil) that possess self-antioxidative properties, having advantages in terms of minimal side effects and exhibiting the ability to simultaneously co-encapsulate and co-release two active compounds. The focus has been oriented towards developing safe cosmetic formulations with broad-spectrum photoprotection based on these new lipid nanocarriers that contain large amounts of vegetable oils and low concentrations of synthetic UVA and UVB filters (butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane - BMDBM and octocrylene - OCT). The lipid nanocarriers have a spherical shape and show good physical stability, with a zeta potential in the range of -25.5 to -32.4 mV. Both vegetable oils play a key role in the preparation of efficient nanocarriers, leading to a less ordered arrangement of the lipid core that offers many spaces for the entrapment of large amounts of BMDBM (79%) and OCT (90%), as wells as improved antioxidant activity and UV absorption properties, particularly for the lipid nanocarriers prepared from rice bran oil. By formulating the lipid nanocarriers into creams containing only 3.5% of the UV filters and 10.5% of the vegetable oils, the resulting sunscreens exhibited improved photoprotection, reflecting up to 91% and 93% of UVA and UVB rays, respectively. A new direction of research achieved by this study is the multiple release strategy of both UV filters from the same lipid nanocarrier. After 24 hours, a slow release of BMDBM (less than 4%) and OCT (17.5%) was obtained through a Fick diffusion process. This study demonstrates a significant advance in the areas of both nanotechnology and cosmetics, developing safer cosmetic formulations that possess broad antioxidant, photoprotective and co-release effectiveness due to the existence of a high content of nanostructured vegetable oils combined with a low amount of synthetic UV filters in the same carrier system.",

    "abstract": "Black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis L.) (BR) fruit extracts with differing compound profiles have shown variable antiproliferative activities against HT-29 colon cancer cell lines. This study used partial least-squares (PLS) regression analysis to develop a high-resolution (1)H NMR-based multivariate statistical model for discerning the biological activity of BR constituents. This model identified specific bioactive compounds and ascertained their relative contribution against cancer cell proliferation. Cyanidin 3-rutinoside and cyanidin 3-xylosylrutinoside were the predominant contributors to the extract bioactivity, but salicylic acid derivatives (e.g., salicylic acid glucosyl ester), quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 3-rutinoside, p-coumaric acid, epicatechin, methyl ellagic acid derivatives (e.g., methyl ellagic acetyl pentose), and citric acid derivatives also contributed significantly to the antiproliferative activity of the berry extracts. This approach enabled the identification of new bioactive components in BR fruits and demonstrates the utility of the method for assessing chemopreventive compounds in foods and food products.",

    "abstract": "The Korean black raspberry (Rubus coreanus Miquel, KB) on ripening is usually consumed as fresh fruit, whereas the unripe KB has been widely used as a source of traditional herbal medicine. Such a stage specific utilization of KB has been assumed due to the changing metabolite profile during fruit ripening process, but so far molecular and biochemical changes during its fruit maturation are poorly understood. To analyze biochemical changes during fruit ripening process at molecular level, firstly, we have sequenced, assembled, and annotated the transcriptome of KB fruits. Over 4.86 Gb of normalized cDNA prepared from fruits was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq\u2122 2000, and assembled into 43,723 unigenes. Secondly, we have reported that alterations in anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins are the major factors facilitating variations in these stages of fruits. In addition, up-regulation of F3'H1, DFR4 and LDOX1 resulted in the accumulation of cyanidin derivatives during the ripening process of KB, indicating the positive relationship between the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and the anthocyanin accumulation. Furthermore, the ability of RcMCHI2 (R. coreanus Miquel chalcone flavanone isomerase 2) gene to complement Arabidopsis transparent testa 5 mutant supported the feasibility of our transcriptome library to provide the gene resources for improving plant nutrition and pigmentation. Taken together, these datasets obtained from transcriptome library and metabolic profiling would be helpful to define the gene-metabolite relationships in this non-model plant.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry-like (RB) polymer particles were prepared, fluorinated, and cast onto glass plates to yield highly water- and oil-repellant superamphiphobic particulate coatings. To procure the RB particles, glycidyl-bearing 212 and 332 nm particles (abbreviated as s-GMA and l-GMA, respectively) were first prepared via surfactant-free free radical emulsion polymerization. Reacting the glycidyl groups of the l-GMA particles with 2,2'-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) (EDEA) produced large amine-functionalized particles (l-NH2). The l-NH2 particles were then reacted with an excess of the s-GMA particles to create RB particles. For surface fluorination, the residual glycidyl groups of the smaller s-GMA particles surrounding the central l-NH2 core of the RB particles were first converted to amino groups by reaction with EDEA. The purified amino-bearing particles were subsequently reacted with an excess of a statistical copolymer poly(2-(perfluorooctyl)ethyl methacrylate-co-glycidyl methacrylate), P(FOEMA-co-GMA). Casting these particles onto glass plates yielded particulate films that exhibited static contact angles of 165 \u00b1 2\u00b0, 155 \u00b1 3\u00b0, 152 \u00b1 4\u00b0, and 143 \u00b1 1\u00b0 and droplet rolling angles of <1 \u00b0, <1 \u00b0, 7 \u00b1 2\u00b0, and 13 \u00b1 2\u00b0 for water, diiodomethane, corn-based cooking oil, and hexadecane droplets, respectively. These results demonstrated that this practical bottom-up approach could be used to produce superamphiphobic coatings.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 30% higher grade premalignant oral intraepithelial neoplasia (OIN) lesions will progress to oral cancer. Although surgery is the OIN treatment mainstay, many OIN lesions recur, which is highly problematic for both surgeons and patients. This clinical trial assessed the chemopreventive efficacy of a natural product-based bioadhesive gel on OIN lesions.\nThis placebo-controlled multicenter study investigated the effects of topical application of bioadhesive gels that contained either 10% w/w freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB) or an identical formulation devoid of BRB placebo to biopsy-confirmed OIN lesions (0.5 g \u00d7 q.i.d., 12 weeks). Baseline evaluative parameters (size, histologic grade, LOH events) were comparable in the randomly assigned BRB (n = 22) and placebo (n = 18) gel cohorts. Evaluative parameters were: histologic grade, clinical size, and LOH.\nTopical application of the BRB gel to OIN lesions resulted in statistically significant reductions in lesional sizes, histologic grades, and LOH events. In contrast, placebo gel lesions demonstrated a significant increase in lesional size and no significant effects on histologic grade or LOH events. Collectively, these data strongly support BRB's chemopreventive impact. A cohort of very BRB-responsive patients, as demonstrated by high therapeutic efficacy, was identified. Corresponding protein profiling studies, which demonstrated higher pretreatment levels of BRB metabolic and keratinocyte differentiation enzymes in BRB-responsive lesions, reinforce the importance of local metabolism and differentiation competency.\nResults from this trial substantiate the LOH reductions identified in the pilot BRB gel study and extend therapeutic effects to significant improvements in histologic grade and lesional size.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays the trend in analytical chemistry is clearly towards the creation of multiple methods with extended coverage, enabling the determination of many different classes of compounds in a single analysis in which virtually all classes of different compounds are included in a single run. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a versatile and selective GC/MS/MS method for metabolite profiling of volatile compounds in apples, raspberries and grapes. Validation of the method was performed in terms of the limit of detection, limit of quantification, linearity range, and inter and intraday precision. Confirmation of the identity of the compounds in samples was carried out by checking compliance of the q/Q ratio of samples and reference standards. The multiple reaction monitoring with selection of two transition ions, one for quantification and one for confirmation, provided excellent selectivity and sensitivity, using the q/Q ratio as a confirmatory parameter. A multi target method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification and confirmation of 160 volatile compounds of raspberries, apples and grapes. The main classes were esters (42), alcohols (32), monoterpenes (31), aldehydes (17), ketones (12), norisoprenoids (8), acids (8), sesquiterpenes (7), pyrazines (3) and ethers (1) allowing the detection and quantification of 69 compounds in apples, 122 in grapes and 42 in raspberries. Moreover, the method developed can be easily extended to volatile compounds in other fruits and can therefore be widely used for quantification/profiling studies in the field of fruit aroma.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry crumbly fruit in red raspberry (Rubus idaeus), widespread in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and British Columbia, Canada, is most commonly caused by a virus infection. Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) has long been attributed as the causal agent of the disease. Recently, the identification of two additional viruses, Raspberry leaf mottle virus (RLMV) and Raspberry latent virus (RpLV), in northern Washington and British Columbia, suggested the existence of a possible new virus complex responsible for the increased severity of the disease. Virus testing of crumbly fruited plants from five fields in northern Washington revealed the presence of RLMV and RpLV, in addition to RBDV. Plants with less severe crumbly fruit symptoms had a much lower incidence of RLMV or RpLV. Field trials using replicated plots of 'Meeker' plants containing single and mixed infections of RBDV, RLMV, or RpLV, along with a virus-free control, were developed to determine the role of RLMV and RpLV in crumbly fruit. Field evaluations during establishment and two fruiting years revealed that plants infected with the three viruses or the combinations RBDV+RLMV and RBDV+RpLV had the greatest reduction in cane growth, or fruit firmness and fruit weight, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that the titer of RBDV was increased ~400-fold when it occurred in mixed infections with RLMV compared to RBDV in single infections. In addition, a virus survey revealed that RLMV and RpLV are present at high incidence in northern Washington; whereas the incidence in southern Washington and Oregon, where crumbly fruit is not as serious a problem, was considerably lower.",

    "abstract": "In addition to CYP2E1, several CYP isoenzymes, notably CYP1A2, 2D6, and 3A4, are suggested to contribute in acetaminophen oxidation and formation of the hepatotoxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). The in vitro CYP2E1 inhibitory potentials of fennel and raspberry leaf, herbs previously found to inhibit CYP1A2, 2D6, and 3A4 activities in vitro, were investigated. Extracts from commercially available herbal products were incubated with recombinant cDNA-expressed human CYP2E1. A validated LC/MS/MS methodology was applied for determination of 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone formation with disulfiram used as a positive inhibitory control. CYP2E1 IC50 inhibition constants were found to be 23 \u00b1 4 and 27 \u00b1 5 \u00b5g/ml for fennel and raspberry leaf, respectively, constants significantly lower than those presented in the literature for other herbal extracts. Together with previous findings, the presented in vitro data for CYP2E1 inhibition suggest that fennel and raspberry leaf have a significant potential of inhibiting all the major metabolic pathways for acetaminophen oxidation and NAPQI formation. Both herbs should be further investigated for their in vivo ability of inhibiting acetaminophen oxidation and NAPQI formation.",

    "abstract": "Study the shelf-life quality changes in raspberry juice with encapsulated lactobacilli (Lactobacillus rhamnosus NRRL B-4495 and Lactobacillus acidophilus NRRL B-442) obtained by spray drying and understand the various factors involved.\nRaspberry powder was obtained from spray drying lactobacilli and raspberry juice with maltodextrin as an additive. Shelf life of the powder was analyzed over a period of 30\u2009d. Acid and bile tolerance and antibiotic resistance was compared before and after spray drying. Water activity, survival, and scanning electron microscope images were also measured during the shelf life.\nA combination of processing conditions: inlet temperature (\u00b0C), maltodextrin to juice solids ratio and inlet feed rate (ml/min) during spray drying had a significant role on the survival of lactobacilli during shelf life. Refrigerated storage provided a higher shelf-life stability with regards to CFU/g (as high as 84% on day 0 and 98% retention by the end of 30\u2009d) compared to room temperature storage. Probiotic properties during shelf life are affected by the processing conditions and encapsulated food matrix. Thus, understanding these aspects in vitro during shelf life gives us a brief insight into the future of non-dairy probiotics.",

    "abstract": "The decrease in the bone mass associated with osteoporosis caused by ovariectomy, aging, and other conditions is accompanied by an increase in bone marrow adipose tissue. The balance between osteoblasts and adipocytes is influenced by a reciprocal relationship. The development of modalities to promote local/systemic bone formation by inhibiting bone marrow adipose tissue is important in the treatment of fractures or metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis. In this study, we examined whether raspberry ketone [4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)butan-2-one; RK], which is one of the major aromatic compounds of red raspberry and exhibits anti-obesity action, could promote osteoblast differentiation in C3H10T1/2 stem cells. Confluent C3H10T1/2 stem cells were treated for 6 days with 10-100 \u03bcg/mL of RK in culture medium containing 10\u2009nM all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) or 300\u2009ng/mL recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP)-2 protein as an osteoblast-differentiating agent. RK in the presence of ATRA increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in a dose-dependent manner. RK in the presence of rhBMP-2 also increased ALP activity. RK in the presence of ATRA also increased the levels of mRNAs of osteocalcin, \u03b11(I) collagen, and TGF-\u03b2s (TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, and TGF-\u03b23) compared with ATRA only. RK promoted the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 stem cells into osteoblasts. However, RK did not affect the inhibition of early-stage adipocyte differentiation. Our results suggest that RK enhances the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 stem cells into osteoblasts, and it may promote bone formation by an action unrelated to adipocyte differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the research conducted was to investigate and evaluate the behavior of pyrimethanil, pyraclostrobin, boscalid, cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos, the active ingredients of selected fungicides and insecticides, on ripe fruit and in fully developed leaves of raspberry of the Laszka variety. The field trial was carried out in the period of one month starting from the first fruit picking. The results obtained indicated that residue levels on the day of the first crop picking did not even approximate the corresponding EU-MRLs (http://ec.europa.eu/sanco_pesticides). Individual substances in raspberry fruits and leaves disappeared at a similar rate. As a result of chlorpyrifos application to the soil, its residue in fruits and leaves occurred for the whole period of fruit bearing, though in fruit they dropped successively. To produce raspberries with residues below or equal to 0.01 \u03bcg g(-1), the application of pesticides should be stopped at least 2-3 weeks before the first crop picking, and on condition that an appropriate preparation (active in low doses) is applied to the last treatments.",

    "abstract": "There is currently substantial interest in dynamic telecytology-the presentation of microscopic findings by live video feed to a cytopathologist at a remote location. However, the initial costs of a telecytology system can be high. We present several low-cost alternatives along with their performance characteristics.\nWe tested 3 low-cost telecytology systems: a Raspberry Pi with a webcam, an iPhone 4S with FaceTime, and an iPhone 4S with a live streaming app. Costs, resolution capacities, and latency periods for image transmission were determined.\nAt $85.55, the Raspberry Pi system is the least expensive telecytology solution described to date. When the cost per megapixel of resolution is considered, the cost of a Raspberry Pi system is 120\u00d7 less than the most expensive commercially available option and about 7-fold less than the iPhone-based alternatives. Latency periods were substantially lower for the iPhone systems: 2.5 \u00b1 1 seconds for FaceTime and 2.8 \u00b1 0.3 seconds for iPhone live streaming versus 6.6 \u00b1 0.6 seconds for the Raspberry Pi system at comparable frame rates.\nThis proof-of-principle study demonstrates that inexpensive telecytology systems are able to stream live video feeds of cytology slides from a microscope to a remote location at useable resolutions.",

    "abstract": "Our team is designing and fully characterizing black raspberry (BRB) food products suitable for long-term cancer prevention studies. The processing, scale-up, and storage effects on the consistency, quality, bioactive stability, and sensory acceptability of two BRB delivery systems of various matrices are presented. BRB dosage, pH, water activity, and texture were consistent in the scale-up production. Confections retained >90% of anthocyanins and ellagitannin after processing. Nectars had >69% of anthocyanins and >66% of ellagitannin retention, which varied with BRB dosage due to the processing difference. Texture remained unchanged during storage. BRB products consumed in a prostate cancer clinical trial were well accepted in sensory tests. Thus, this study demonstrates that two different BRB foods can be formulated to meet quality standards with a consistent bioactive pattern and successfully scaled up for a large human clinical trial focusing on cancer risk and other health outcomes.",
