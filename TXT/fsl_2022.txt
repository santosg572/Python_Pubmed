    "abstract": "We aimed to validate the estimation of the brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) using synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (SyMRI) by comparison with software tools of the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). In addition to a cross-sectional method comparison, longitudinal volume changes were assessed to further elucidate the suitability of SyMRI for quantification of disease-specific changes.\nMRI data from 216 patients with MS and 28 control participants were included for volume estimation by SyMRI and FSL-SIENAX. Moreover, longitudinal data from 35 patients with MS were used to compare registration-based percentage brain volume changes estimated using FSL-SIENA to difference-based calculations of volume changes using SyMRI.\nWe observed strong correlations of estimated brain volumes between the two methods. While SyMRI overestimated grey matter and BPF compared to FSL-SIENAX, indicating a systematic bias, there was excellent agreement according to intra-class correlation coefficients for grey matter and good agreement for BPF and white matter. Bland-Altman plots suggested that the inter-method differences in BPF were smaller in patients with brain atrophy compared to those without atrophy. Longitudinal analyses revealed a tendency for higher atrophy rates for SyMRI than for SIENA, but SyMRI had a robust correlation and a good agreement with SIENA.\nIn summary, BPF based on data from SyMRI and FSL-SIENAX is not directly transferable because an overestimation and higher variability of SyMRI values were observed. However, the consistency and correlations between the two methods were satisfactory, and SyMRI was suitable to quantify disease-specific atrophy in MS.",

    "abstract": "Thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, anemia, and infection are life-threatening issues following accidental or intentional radiation exposure. Since few therapeutics are available, safe and efficacious small molecules to mitigate radiation-induced injury need to be developed. Our previous study showed the synthetic TLR2/TLR6 ligand fibroblast stimulating lipopeptide (FSL-1) prolonged survival and provided MyD88-dependent mitigation of hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) in mice. Although mice and humans differ in TLR number, expression, and function, nonhuman primate (NHP) TLRs are like those of humans; therefore, studying both animal models is critical for drug development. The objectives of this study were to determine the efficacy of FSL-1 on hematopoietic recovery in small and large animal models subjected to sublethal total body irradiation and investigate its mechanism of action. In mice, we demonstrate a lack of adverse effects, an easy route of delivery (subcutaneous) and efficacy in promoting hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation by FSL-1. NHP given radiation, followed a day later with a single subcutaneous administration of FSL-1, displayed no adversity but showed elevated hematopoietic cells. Our analyses revealed that FSL-1 promoted red blood cell development and induced soluble effectors following radiation exposure. Cytologic analysis of bone marrow aspirates revealed a striking enhancement of mononuclear progenitor cells in FSL-1-treated NHP. Combining the efficacy of FSL-1 in promoting hematopoietic cell recovery with the lack of adverse effects induced by a single administration supports the application of FSL-1 as a viable countermeasure against H-ARS.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to answer the questions of whether early-life (perinatal and/or juvenile) exercise can induce antidepressant-like effects in a validated rodent model of depression, and whether such early-life intervention could prevent or reverse the adverse effects of early-life stress in their offspring.\nMale and female Flinders sensitive line rats born to a dam that exercised during gestation, or not, were either maternally separated between PND02 and 16 and weaned on PND17 or not. Half of these animals then underwent a fourteen-day low-intensity exercise regimen from PND22. Baseline depressive-like behaviour was assessed on PND21 and then reassessed on PND36, whereafter hippocampal monoamine levels, redox state markers and metabolic markers relevant to mitochondrial function were measured.\nPre-pubertal exercise was identified as the largest contributing factor to the observed effects, where it decreased immobility time in the FST by 6%, increased time spent in the open arms of the EPM by 9%. Hippocampal serotonin and norepinephrine levels were also increased by 35% and 26%, respectively, whilst nicotinic acid was significantly decreased.\nThese findings suggest that pre-pubertal low-intensity exercise induces beneficial biological alterations that could translate into antidepressant behaviour in genetically susceptible individuals.",

    "abstract": "The \"replication crisis\" in neuroscientific research has led to calls for improving reproducibility. In traditional neuroscience analyses, irreproducibility may occur as a result of issues across various stages of the methodological process. For example, different operating systems, different software packages, and even different versions of the same package can lead to variable results. Nipype, an open-source Python project, integrates different neuroimaging software packages uniformly to improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging analyses. Nipype has the advantage over traditional software packages (e.g., FSL, ANFI, SPM, etc.) by (1) providing comprehensive software development frameworks and usage information, (2) improving computational efficiency, (3) facilitating reproducibility through sufficient details, and (4) easing the steep learning curve. Despite the rich tutorials it has provided, the Nipype community lacks a standard three-level GLM tutorial for FSL. Using the classical Flanker task dataset, we first precisely reproduce a three-level GLM analysis with FSL ",

    "abstract": "There is a pressing need to identify biological indicators of major depression to help guide proper diagnosis and optimize treatment. Animal models mimicking aspects of depression constitute essential tools for early-stage exploration of relevant pathways. In this study, we used the Flinders Sensitive and Resistant Line (FSL/FRL) to explore central and peripheral transcriptional changes in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway genes and their temporal regulation after a single dose of S-ketamine (15\u00a0mg/kg). We found that S-ketamine induced both rapid (1\u00a0hour) and sustained (2 and 14 days) antidepressant-like effects in the FSL rats. Analysis of mRNA expression revealed significant strain effects of Vegf, Vegf164, Vegfr-1, Nrp1, Nrp2, Rictor, and Raptor in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and of Vegf164, GbetaL, and Tsc1 in the hippocampus (HIP), which indicates suppression of VEGF signaling in the FSL rats compared to FRL rats. This notion was further substantiated by reduced expression of Vegf and Mtor in plasma from FSL rats. In the brain, S-ketamine induced transcriptional changes in the acute phase, not the sustained phase. There were significant treatment effects of S-ketamine on Vegfr-2 in both PFC and HIP and on Vegf and Vegfr-1 in HIP. Moreover, we found that S-ketamine specifically restored reduced levels of Nrp2 and Mtor in the PFC of the FSL rats. In conclusion, this study substantiates the use of the FRL/FSL rats to explore the depressive-like behavior at the transcriptional level of the VEGF pathway genes and study their regulation in response to various treatment paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Integrin \u03b26 (ITGB6), an epithelial-specific receptor, is downregulated in the gingival epithelium of periodontitis and is associated with inflammation response and periodontitis development. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of ITGB6 downregulation in the human gingival epithelium remains unclear. Fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1 (FSL-1), an oral biofilm component, promotes an epithelial cell-driven proinflammatory response in periodontitis partially by suppressing ITGB6 expression. The aim of the current study was to investigate the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of ITGB6 inhibition by FSL-1 in human epithelial cells (HaCaT and primary human gingival epithelial cells), and to delineate the transcriptional mechanism of ITGB6 suppression in periodontitis. We found that FSL-1 inhibited ITGB6 transcription through increasing forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) expression and inhibiting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation. Furthermore, FOXO1 bound to STAT3 directly, leading to decreased STAT3 phosphorylation induced by FSL-1. Consequently, the binding of phosphorylated STAT3 to the ITGB6 promoter was decreased, and ITGB6 transcription was therefore downregulated following FSL-1 stimulation. The reciprocal action of STAT3 and FOXO1 on ITGB6 downregulation was also confirmed by the immunostaining of the inflammatory epithelium associated with periodontitis. Our findings suggest that the interaction of FOXO1-STAT3 may be a useful signal target for the treatment of periodontitis.",

    "abstract": "Exposure of Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats to post-weaning social isolation rearing (SIR) causes depressive- and social anxiety-like symptoms resistant to, or worsened by, fluoxetine. SIR typically presents with psychotic-like symptoms, while the paradoxical response to fluoxetine suggests unaddressed psychotic-like manifestations. Psychotic depression (MDpsy) is invariably treatment resistant. To further explore the mood-psychosis continuum in fluoxetine resistant FSL-SIR rats (Mncube et al., 2021), mood-, psychotic-, anxiety-, and social-related behaviour and biomarker response to antidepressant/antipsychotic treatment was studied in FSL-SIR rats. Methods: Sprague Dawley (SD) and FSL pups were subjected to social rearing or SIR from postnatal day (PND) 21. Thereafter FSL-SIR rats received olanzapine (5\u00a0mg/kg x 14 days) or olanzapine+fluoxetine (OLZ+FLX; 5\u00a0mg/kg + 10\u00a0mg/kg for 14 days) from PND 63. Psychotic-like, depressive, anxiety, and social behaviour were assessed from PND 72, versus saline-treated FSL-SIR rats, using the prepulse inhibition (PPI), forced swim, open field and social interaction tests. Post-mortem cortico-hippocampal norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), and dopamine (DA), as well as plasma corticosterone and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase levels were evaluated. Results: SD-SIR and FSL-SIR rats present with significant depressive-like behaviour (\nSIR-exposed FSL rats display worsened anxiety, as well as depressive and psychotic-like symptoms, variably responsive to olanzapine or OLZ+FLX. Depleted monoamines are reversed by OLZ+FLX, less so by olanzapine. FSL-SIR rats show promising face and construct but limited predictive validity for MDpsy, perhaps more relevant for bipolar disorder.",

    "abstract": "Developing accurate subcortical volumetric quantification tools is crucial for neurodevelopmental studies, as they could reduce the need for challenging and time-consuming manual segmentation. In this study, the accuracy of two automated segmentation tools, FSL-FIRST (with three different boundary correction settings) and FreeSurfer, were compared against manual segmentation of the hippocampus and subcortical nuclei, including the amygdala, thalamus, putamen, globus pallidus, caudate and nucleus accumbens, using volumetric and correlation analyses in 80 5-year-olds. Both FSL-FIRST and FreeSurfer overestimated the volume on all structures except the caudate, and the accuracy varied depending on the structure. Small structures such as the amygdala and nucleus accumbens, which are visually difficult to distinguish, produced significant overestimations and weaker correlations with all automated methods. Larger and more readily distinguishable structures such as the caudate and putamen produced notably lower overestimations and stronger correlations. Overall, the segmentations performed by FSL-FIRST's default pipeline were the most accurate, whereas FreeSurfer's results were weaker across the structures. In line with prior studies, the accuracy of automated segmentation tools was imperfect with respect to manually defined structures. However, apart from amygdala and nucleus accumbens, FSL-FIRST's agreement could be considered satisfactory (Pearson correlation\u2009>\u20090.74, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)\u2009>\u20090.68 and Dice score coefficient (DSC)\u2009>\u20090.87) with highest values for the striatal structures (putamen, globus pallidus, caudate) (Pearson correlation\u2009>\u20090.77, ICC\u2009>\u20090.87 and DSC\u2009>\u20090.88, respectively). Overall, automated segmentation tools do not always provide satisfactory results, and careful visual inspection of the automated segmentations is strongly advised.",

    "abstract": "FSL's FMRIB's Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FSL-FIRST) is a widely used and well-validated tool. Automated thalamic segmentation is a common application and an important longitudinal measure for multiple sclerosis (MS). However, FSL-FIRST's algorithm is based on shape models derived from non-MS groups. As such, the present study sought to systematically assess common thalamic segmentation errors made by FSL-FIRST on MRIs from people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).\nFSL-FIRST was applied to generate thalamic segmentation masks for 890 MR images in PwMS. Images and masks were reviewed systematically to classify and quantify errors, as well as associated anatomical variations and MRI abnormalities. For cases with overt errors (n = 362), thalamic masks were corrected and quantitative volumetric differences were calculated.\nIn the entire quantitative volumetric group, the mean volumetric error of FSL-FIRST was 2.74% (0.360 ml): among only corrected cases, the mean volumetric error was 6.79% (0.894 ml). The average percent volumetric error associated with seven error types, two anatomical variants, and motions artifacts are reported. Additional analyses showed that the presence of motion artifacts or anatomical variations significantly increased the probability of error (\u03c7\nIn PwMS, FSL-FIRST thalamic segmentation miscalculates thalamic volumetry in a predictable fashion, and may be biased to overestimate highly atrophic thalami. As such, it is recommended that segmentations be reviewed and corrected manually when appropriate for specific studies.",
