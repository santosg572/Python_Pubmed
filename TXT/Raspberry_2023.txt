    "abstract": "There has been incremental progress in moving BCI out of the laboratory environment and into the homes of those who would benefit most, especially children living with severe physical disabilities. Practical issues, such as available computational resources and long calibration times, have slowed down the adoption of such systems. To develop an efficient and scalable machine learning framework consistent with early approaches that facilitate at-home BCI use, this study provides valuable insights into measuring the behavioral characteristics of a Raspberry Pi 4 (RPi4) during the operation and execution of standard BCI processes, including the training and evaluation of classifier models. The results, which evaluated ten standard classifiers, including the Riemannian Geometry (RG) framework and more advanced deep learning approaches like Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were profiled on RPi4. These were compared to Desktop and MacBook computations for metrics such as training time, inference time, peak memory, and incremental memory usage, with computational bottlenecks identified. Our assessment revealed comparable performance metrics (84.3% of accuracy, recall, and f1_score, and 84.7% precision) for the neural network models despite the lower computational resources. Profiling results, including 1.74 sec training time, 0.405 sec inference time, 1154.9 MiB peak memory, and 405.2 MiB incremental memory usage, also demonstrated that the RPi4 is a potentially viable device for low-cost BCI systems. However, high-resource demanding classifiers such as ANN may need to be carefully considered in their implementation, which, in turn, will scale down the potential cost and complexity of adopting practical, impactful at-home BCI systems.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effects of raspberry ketone on hypothalamic inflammation and its mechanism. Mouse microglia cells (BV2 cells) were cultured in vitro with palmitic acid (100 \u03bcM) to induce inflammation model and then incubated with raspberry ketone (5, 20, 50 \u03bcM) alone or raspberry ketone (50 \u03bcM) and the specific inhibitor of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), genipin (10 \u03bcM), to test the role of UCP2 in raspberry ketone regulatory of inflammation. Meanwhile, C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet containing raspberry ketone (0.2%, wt/wt) for 16 wk or 7 d to observe the effects of raspberry ketone on the body weights and hypothalamic inflammation of mice. The expression levels of inflammatory factors, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), were detected using RT-qPCR, Elisa, and Western blotting, respectively. At the cellular level, raspberry ketone reduced the content of inflammatory factors in BV2 cells and in the cell culture medium. Genipin inhibited the anti-inflammatory effect of raspberry ketone on BV2 cells. At the animal level, after 16 wk of feeding, raspberry ketone-containing diets significantly reduced the body weight of mice, but had no significant effect on the mRNA expression level of hypothalamic inflammatory factors. On the other hand, 7 d of raspberry ketone gavage significantly reduced mRNA and protein expression of hypothalamic inflammatory factors. The results of this study suggest that raspberry ketone could regulate high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice, and the specific mechanism may be to inhibit hypothalamic inflammation in mice by regulating UCP2 gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberries, valued for their nutrients and bioactive compounds, have broad uses in processing and healthy products. However, limited comprehensive research focused on the comparison of phenolic compounds of red raspberry, especially species cultivated in Northeast China, has been reported. This study aimed to conduct a thorough investigation of 24 red raspberry varieties in Northeast China for the first time, evaluating their phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacities. The results showed that 'DNS1' had the highest total phenolic content (TPC), 'Willamette' had the highest total flavonoid content (TFC), and 'Boyne' had the highest total anthocyanin content (TAC). Phenolic compounds in red raspberries were predominantly found in esterified form, while glycosylated phenolics should not be overlooked. Chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, and arbutin were the main phenolic compounds, and the distribution of their contents varied between varieties. The antioxidant activity in the red raspberry had a close association with the content of phenolic compounds. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities were higher in samples from 'DNS1', 'Boyne', 'Beijing10', 'DNS5', and 'Willamette' varieties. These varieties should be given priority in breeding programs that aim to boost the utility and bioactive profile of red raspberries. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Red raspberry is becoming a desirable commercially grown fruit species and is viewed as a new functional food. In this context, this research offers strong support for confirming the quality of 24 varieties of red raspberry and plays a critical role in the food industry. It also indicates the potential sources of superior varieties of red raspberry, which are advantageous for growers and consumers in search of high-quality red raspberry varieties.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the impact of adding raspberry pomace to the phenolic content and biological properties of freeze-dried apple/raspberry bars. The bars were prepared by replacing apple puree with raspberry pomace (5-50%), and their phenolic compounds were assessed using ethanol and buffer extracts. This work also explored the potential bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds in enriched bars through a simulated digestion process (digest). Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory (LOX, COX-2 inhibition), antihypertensive (ACE inhibition), and antiproliferative effects on AGS and HT-29 cancer cells were evaluated. The total polyphenol content was highest in the all bar variants post-digestion. The highest-904.26 \u00b1 23.5 mg/100 g-was determined for the B50 sample In the enriched bars, the concentration of chlorogenic acid decreased from 6.99 \u00b1 1.08 mg/L for BP5 to 2.75 \u00b1 0.32 mg/L for BP50, but the ellagic acid concentration increased from 1.46 \u00b1 0.02 mg/L for BP5 to 12.73 \u00b1 0.09 mg/L for BP50. Among the tested extracts, the highest antioxidant and LOX, COX-2 inhibiting activity was determined for digest. The ability to neutralize free radicals increased with raspberry pomace addition from 3.63 \u00b1 0.26 mM TE/100 g for BC to 5.58 \u00b1 0.22 mM TE/100 g for the BP50 sample. ACE inhibition was quite similar for ethanolic and digest extracts, but much weaker for buffer extracts. The lowest EC50 value was 1.04 \u00b1 0.03 mg/mL for the BP30 ethanolic sample. Analyzed extracts showed antiproliferative activity against both tested cell lines. The EC50 values for HT-29 cancer cells decreased from 0.354 \u00b1 0.031 mg/mL for BC to 0.026 \u00b1 0.006 mg/mL for the BP50 digest sample. It can be assumed that the BP30 bar best met the assumed criteria, and is optimal for both sensory quality (receiving an average score of 4.45) and health benefits.",

    "abstract": "Remontant raspberry cultivars originally produce fruit in the upper part of primocanes in the fall, but if retained over winter, they can produce a second crop in the lower part of the floricanes the following spring. Maintaining remontant cultivars to yield twice during the cane's growth cycle corresponds to a double-cropping system, which enables an increase in the total yield and the extension of the fruiting season. To date, there is little information on changes in fruit quality between primocane and floricane crops. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate variations in the content of sugars and organic acids, fruit weight, color and textural and sensorial attributes among five newly introduced remontant raspberry cultivars ('Dafne', 'Kokanee', 'Paris', 'Versailles' and 'Primalba') and the control cultivar 'Enrosadira'. The specific aim was to evaluate how a double-cropping system in each cultivar may affect the variability in quality traits between primocane and floricane crops. The results showed a significant increase in fruit weight and individual and total sugar content in primocane crops, while significantly brighter red-colored and firmer fruits were observed in floricane crops. Cultivars did not differ from the control regarding total sugar content and sweetness index, while the content of individual sugars caused greater variations. The highest content of citric, malic and total acid (9.74, 1.42 and 11.25 mg 100 g",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease with a high mortality rate due to non-traumatic fractures. The risk of osteoporosis is increasing globally due to an increasing aging population. Current therapies are limited to delaying disease progression. Recently, the need to discover foods with osteogenic activity for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis has been emphasized. We focused on bone formation via osteoblast differentiation, considering bone formation and resorption during bone homeostasis. \nWe identified the third subfraction of n-hexane fraction (RL-Hex-NF3) of RL, an endemic Korean plant with osteogenic activity, which increased bone density in ovariectomized mice, a representative animal model of osteoporosis, via the depletion of female hormones, which resulted from the increase in the osteoblast population. RL-Hex-NF3 induced osteoblast differentiation and the expression of osteogenic markers in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. Seven compounds were identified from RL-Hex-NF3 using NMR spectroscopy. Of these, three compounds, namely, 3\u03b2-hydroxy-18\u03b1,19\u03b1-urs-20-en-28-oic acid, betulinic acid, and (1S,6R,7S)-muurola-4,10(14)-diene-15-ol, showed strong osteogenic activity.\nRL-Hex-NF3 and its compounds suppress bone loss via their osteogenic properties, suggesting that they could be a potent candidate to treat osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "The biostimulant SuperFifty, produced from the brown algae \nMetabolome analysis was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS), and essential elements analysis was performed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).\nHere, we demonstrate that SuperFifty increases the fruit size of both raspberries and strawberries and enhances the yield in these two berry crops by 42.1% (raspberry) and 33.9% (strawberry) while preserving the nutritional properties of the fruits. Metabolome analysis of 100 metabolites revealed that antioxidants, essential amino acids, organic acids, sugars, and vitamins, such as glutathione, alanine, asparagine, histidine, threonine, serine, tryptophan, sucrose, citric acid, pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), as well as other primary metabolites, remain the same in the SuperFifty-primed fruits. Secondary metabolites, such as caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, kaempferol, and quercetin, also maintained their levels in the SuperFifty-primed fruits. Analysis of essential elements demonstrated that elements important for human health, such as Zn, Mn, Fe, B, Cu, K, and Ca, maintain the same levels in the raspberry and strawberry fruits obtained from the biostimulant-primed plants. Magnesium, an important element known as a co-factor in many enzymatic reactions related to both plant physiology and human health, increased in both raspberry and strawberry fruits primed with SuperFifty. Finally, we discuss the potential financial and health benefits of the SuperFifty-induced priming for both growers and consumers.\nWe demonstrate that SuperFifty significantly enhances the yield of both raspberries and strawberries, improves the marketable grade of the fruits (larger and heavier fruits), and enhances the nutritional properties by elevating Mg content in the fruits. Altogether, this biostimulant-induced molecular priming offers an environmentally friendly, efficient, and sustainable way to enhance the yield and quality of berry crops, with clear benefits to both berry producers and customers.",

    "abstract": "Secondary metabolites are a group of invaluable phytochemicals in raspberries. Fermentation process leads to changes in the phytochemical composition of fruits. This study aimed to investigate the influence of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei FBKL1.0328 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum FBKL1.0310 on the secondary metabolites of red raspberry juice (CR) and uncover their conversion pathways via metabolomics based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). A total of 695 secondary metabolites in the unfermented and fermented samples were identified. There were 90, 83 and 52 differential secondary metabolites identified in LCR (L. paracasei FBKL1.0328 fermented raspberry juice) vs. CR, LPR (L. plantarum FBKL1.0310 fermented raspberry juice) vs. CR, and LCR vs. LPR, respectively. Certain phenolic acids (e.g. 3-phenyllacitc acid), flavonoids (e.g. galangin-7-glucoside), alkaloids (e.g. indole-3-lactic acid), and terpenoids (e.g. glucosyl 7-methyl-3-methyleneoctane-1,2,6,7-tetraol) were selected as the crucial differential metabolites. These two lactobacilli utilized distinct metabolic pathways for processing secondary metabolites. L. paracasei FBKL1.0328 primarily transformed flavonoids through the \"Flavone and flavonol biosynthesis\" pathway. L. plantarum FBKL1.0310 mainly converted phenolic acids via the \"Tyrosine metabolism\" pathway and the \"Aminobenzoate degradation\" pathway. Interestingly, L. plantarum FBKL1.0310 outperformed L. paracasei FBKL1.0328 in upregulating certain valuable bioactive compounds such as indole-3-lactic acid and 3-phenyllacitc acid, underscoring its potential as a promising strain for developing health-beneficial fermented fruit juices. These findings provide insights to how different lactobacilli modify secondary metabolite composition in red raspberry juice and offer valuable information for the industrial application of lactobacilli in fruit processing.",

    "abstract": "There is continuing interest in the synthesis of raspberry-like polymer particles, among which most of the reports have tended to focus on polymer composite particles, while there are relatively few examples of polymer particles with a single component. In this study, raspberry-like poly(methyl methacrylate)(PMMA) particles were synthesized by a one-step method in a ternary solvent mixture with binary initiators. The effects of different polymerization parameters, including the solvent composition, the initiator composition, the stabilizer component, the polymerization temperature, the stirring rate, and the nature of the monomer, on the morphology and size of the resulting particles were studied. A plausible mechanism for raspberry-like particle formation was suggested based on the monitoring data of the polymerization kinetics. The raspberry-like PMMA particles have a high dispersion stability in a salty aqueous environment.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to analyze the chemical composition of raspberry using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology, predict the potential effects of raspberry in treating type 2 diabetes through network pharmacology, and conduct preliminary validation through in\u00a0vitro experiments.\nA Waters CORTECS C18 column (3.0\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009mm, 2.7\u2009\u03bcm) was used; mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water and mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Gradient elution was performed with full-scan mode in both positive and negative ion modes, covering a mass range of m/z 100-1500. The chemical components of raspberry were analyzed and identified based on secondary spectra from databases and relevant literature. The disease targets related to type 2 diabetes were searched, and protein-protein interaction network analysis as well as gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were conducted on the intersecting targets of the active components of raspberry and the disease. HepG2 cells were used for experimental validation, with high glucose-induced insulin resistance models established. The CCK-8 method was employed to assess the effects of raspberry on cell proliferation, while Western blotting was used to measure the expression of proteins related to the AGE/RAGE signaling pathway.\nA total of 47 components were identified, including 10 organic acids, 15 flavonoids, 12 phenols, 2 alkaloids, 4 terpenoids, 1 miscellaneous compound, 1 stilbene, 1 steroid and its derivatives, and 1 diterpenoid. Through database screening, seven active components were identified: kaempferol, epicatechin, ellagic acid, crocetin, stigmasterol, fisetin, and isorhamnetin. KEGG and GO results indicated that the therapeutic effects of raspberry on type 2 diabetes may be related to the advanced glycation end product (AGE)- receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) signaling pathway. Establishment of an insulin resistance model in HepG2 cells demonstrated that, compared to the control group, the raspberry treatment group upregulated p53 protein expression while downregulating the expression of RAGE, Akt1, and Caspase-3 proteins.\nThis study preliminarily elucidates that the therapeutic effects of raspberry in treating type 2 diabetes may be mediated through the inhibition of the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, providing important references for the study of the pharmacological basis and clinical application of raspberry.",

    "abstract": "Conventional solid-based SERS substrates often face challenges with inconsistent sample distribution, while liquid-based SERS substrates are prone to aggregation and precipitation, resulting in irreproducible signals in both cases. In this study, we tackled this dilemma by designing and synthesizing raspberry-like plasmonic nanoaggregates that exhibit a high density of hotspots and are colloidally stable at the same time. In particular, the nanoaggregates consist of a core made of functionalized polystyrene (PS) microspheres, which act as a template for rapid self-assembly of Au@Ag core-shell nanoparticles to form raspberry-like hierarchical nanoaggregates within 5 min of mixing. The optimized nanoaggregates can be used as reproducible and stable SERS substrates for a range of wastewater pollutants (e.g., rhodamine 6G (R6G) and malachite green (MG)) and nucleobases (e.g., adenine and uracil), with the detection limits as low as 1 \u00d7 10",

    "abstract": "The production of low-cost, small footprint imaging sensor would be invaluable for airborne global monitoring of pollen, which could allow for mitigation of hay fever symptoms. We demonstrate the use of a white light LED (light emitting diode) to illuminate pollen grains and capture their scattering pattern using a Raspberry Pi camera. The scattering patterns are transformed into 20\u00d7 microscope magnification equivalent images using deep learning. We show the ability to produce images of pollen from plant species previously unseen by the neural network in training. Such a technique could be applied to imaging airborne particulates that contribute to air pollution, and could be used in the field of environmental science, health science and agriculture.",

    "abstract": "The cotton whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) is a major global pest, causing significant crop damage through viral infestation and feeding. Traditional B. tabaci recognition relies on human eyes, which requires a large amount of work and high labor costs. The pests overlapping generations, high reproductive capacity, small size, and migratory behavior present challenges for the real-time monitoring and early warning systems. This study aims to develop an efficient, high-throughput automated system for detection of the cotton whiteflies. In this work, a novel tool for cotton whitefly fast identification and quantification was developed based on deep learning-based model. This approach enhances the effectiveness of B. tabaci control by facilitating earlier detection of its establishment in cotton, thereby allowing for a quicker implementation of management strategies.\nWe compiled a dataset of 1200 annotated images of whiteflies on cotton leaves, augmented using techniques like flipping and rotation. We modified the YOLO v8s model by replacing the C2f module with the Swin-Transformer and introducing a P2 structure in the Head, achieving a precision of 0.87, mAP\nUtilizing the enhanced YOLO v8s deep learning model, we have achieved precise detection and counting of whiteflies, enabling its application on hardware devices like the Raspberry Pi. This approach is highly suitable for research requiring accurate quantification of cotton whiteflies, including phenotypic analyses. Future work will focus on deploying such equipment in large fields to manage whitefly infestations.",

    "abstract": "Rubus idaeus is a pivotal cultivated species of raspberry known for its attractive color, distinct flavor, and numerous health benefits. It can be used in pharmaceutical, cosmetics, agriculture and food industries not only as fresh but also as a processed product. Nowadays due to climatic changes, genetic diversity of cultivars has decreased dramatically. However, until now, the status of wild R. idaeus resources in China have not been exploited. In this study, we investigated the resources of wild R. idaeus in China to secure its future potential and sustainability. The MaxEnt model was used to predict R. idaeus suitable habitats and spatial distribution patterns for current and future climate scenarios, based on wild domestic geographic distribution data, current and future climate variables, and topographic variables. The results showed that, mean temperature of the coldest quarter (bio11), precipitation of the coldest quarter (bio19), precipitation of the warmest quarter (bio18), and temperature seasonality (bio4) were crucial factors affecting the distribution of R. idaeus. Presently, the suitable habitats were mainly distributed in the north of China including Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Beijing, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang. According to our results, in 2050s, the total suitable habitat area of R. idaeus will increase under SSP1-2.6 and then will be decreased with climate change, while in the 2090s, the total suitable habitat area will continue to decrease. From the present to the 2090s, the centroid distribution of R. idaeus in China will shift towards the east and the species will always be present in Inner Mongolia. Our results provide wild resource information and theoretical reference for the protection and rational utilization of R. idaeus.",

    "abstract": "Actinobacteria may help the mycorrhizal symbiosis by producing various bioactive metabolites. Mycorrhizae, in turn, are very important since they increase the absorption of nutrients, promoting the growth of their host plant and making inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi (AM) a common practice applied in agriculture and forestry. The cultivation of Rubus idaeus (raspberry) is widespread in Patagonia, Argentina; however, the potential benefits of using actinobacteria-mycorrhizal inoculums to enhance crop growth and yield remain unexplored. The objective of this work was to study the interaction between actinobacteria (Streptomyces, Actinomycetota) and AM in raspberry plants. We performed an experiment applying 4 treatments to raspberry plants growing in two substrates, sterile soil and natural (non-sterile) soil. The treatments consisted in a control (without inoculation) and three inoculations treatments (AM, Streptomyces SH9 strain, and AM\u2009+\u2009Streptomyces). After 3\u00a0months of inoculation, mycorrhization parameters (%) and plant growth were recorded. When comparing both substrates, the mycorrhization parameters were higher in natural soil than in sterile soil. The co-inoculation with AM\u2009+\u2009Streptomyces SH9 showed the highest mycorrhization. Both factors (treatment x substrate) interacted showing that in sterile soil the treatments with the highest effect on mycorrhization parameters were AM and the co-inoculation, while in natural soil all inoculations improved mycorrhization parameters, being highest with the co-inoculation. These results show that Streptomyces SH9 strain helps the mycorrhizal symbiosis in raspberry, being the first report about the effect of a native rhizospheric actinobacterium on an economically important species, promising potential for environmentally friendly improvements in raspberry crops within the temperate Southern Patagonian region.",

    "abstract": "Using LC-MS/MS analysis we previously showed for the first time (Carcinogenesis 43:746-753, 2022) that levels of DNA damage-induced by benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), an oral carcinogen and tobacco smoke (TS) constituent, were significantly higher in buccal cells of smokers than those in non-smokers; these results suggest the potential contribution of B[a]P in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in humans. Treating cancers, including OSCC at late stages even with improved targeted therapies, continues to be a major challenge. Thus interception/prevention remains a preferable approach for OSCC management and control. In previous preclinical studies we and others demonstrated the protective effects of black raspberry (BRB) against carcinogen-induced DNA damage and OSCC. Thus, to translate preclinical findings we tested the hypothesis, in a Phase 0 clinical study, that BRB administration reduces DNA damage induced by B[a]P in buccal cells of smokers. After enrolling 27 smokers, baseline buccal cells were collected before the administration of BRB lozenges (5/day for 8 weeks, 1 gm BRB powder/lozenge) at baseline, at the middle and the end of BRB administration. The last samples were collected at four weeks after BRB cessation (washout period). B[a]P-induced DNA damage (BPDE-N2-dG) was evaluated by LC-MS/MS. BRB administration resulted in a significant reduction in DNA damage: 26.3% at the midpoint (p = 0.01506) compared to baseline, 36.1% at the end of BRB administration (p = 0.00355), and 16.6% after BRB cessation (p = 0.007586). Our results suggest the potential benefits of BRB as a chemopreventive agent against the development of TS-initiated OSCC.",

    "abstract": "Raspberries (Rosales: Rosaceae) are considered to be one of most important crops in northwestern Morocco. However, this sector is seriously affected by the attack of Drosophila suzukii, which impairs the production and the export. Furthermore, the eco-ethology and population dynamics of D. suzukii under Moroccan conditions are still poorly understood. In Larache region, we monitored the population dynamics of D. suzukii adults using 4 traps baited with mashed ripe banana mixed with yeast, and reported the infestation levels during spring of 2022, 2023, and 2024 on raspberry cultivar Rubus idaeus var. Yazmin. Our results indicate that a maximum of 14, 20, and 28 D. suzukii adults per trap were caught weekly at the end of April 2022, in the middle of March 2023, and in the middle of April 2024, respectively. Furthermore, three peaks of D. suzukii adult flies were observed each year, whereas a total of six generations were predicted according to the accumulated degree-days. The male sex ratio of trapped D. suzukii was 1:0.32, 1:0.38, and 1:0.42 in 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. Raspberry fruit infestation reached a maximum of 76%, 75%, and 64% at the beginning of May 2022, middle of April 2023, and end of April 2024, respectively. Under the climate change scenario, knowledge of the eco-ethology of this insect and its population dynamics is essential for developing an IPM control strategy in Morocco, and further studies are ongoing to establish a biological and reasoned chemical approach based on degree-days.",

    "abstract": "Winter dormancy is a key process in the phenology of temperate perennials. Climate change is severely impacting its course leading to economic losses in agriculture. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms, as well as the genetic basis of the different responses, is necessary for the development of climate-resilient cultivars. This study aims to provide an insight into winter dormancy in red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L). We report the transcriptomic profiles during dormancy in two raspberry cultivars with contrasting responses. The cultivar 'Glen Ample' showed a typical perennial phenology, whereas 'Glen Dee' registered consistent dormancy dysregulation, exhibiting active growth and flowering out of season. RNA-seq combined with weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified gene clusters in both genotypes that exhibited time-dependent expression profiles. Functional analysis of 'Glen Ample' gene clusters highlighted the significance of the cell and structural development prior to dormancy entry as well the role of genetic and epigenetic processes such as RNAi and DNA methylation in regulating gene expression. Dormancy release in 'Glen Ample' was associated with up-regulation of transcripts associated with the resumption of metabolism, nucleic acid biogenesis, and processing signal response pathways. Many of the processes occurring in 'Glen Ample' were dysregulated in 'Glen Dee' and 28 transcripts exhibiting time-dependent expression in 'Glen Ample' that also had an Arabidopsis homologue were not found in 'Glen Dee'. These included a gene with homology to Arabidopsis VRN1 (RiVRN1.1) that exhibited a sharp decline in expression following dormancy induction in 'Glen Ample'. Characterization of the gene region in the 'Glen Dee' genome revealed two large insertions upstream of the ATG start codon. We propose that expression below detection level of a specific VRN1 homologue in 'Glen Dee' causes dormancy misregulation as a result of inappropriate expression of a subset of genes that are directly or indirectly regulated by RiVRN1.1.",

    "abstract": "Thermal burns are the most common type of burn injuries. Medical treatment for burns is crucial, especially for third-degree burns and when a significant surface area of the body is affected. One of the most pressing issues in modern medicine is the search for new effective means to accelerate the healing of burn wounds. Oxygen radicals play a significant role in maintaining homeostasis, forming the body's resistance to infection, and ensuring the regeneration of organs and tissues. In this study, a superoxide (O2-)-producing enzyme (SPE) from raspberries was applied (topically to the skin, injected under the wound surface, with solution concentrations of 12.75% and 5%) after a third-degree thermal burn to determine its reparative effects on the skin. To assess the condition of the animals that had suffered burn injuries and the healing process, blood parameters were analyzed, and cytogenetic indices of bone marrow from the femur of the animals were studied: mitotic index, number of polyploid cells, and chromosomal aberrations. When analyzing hematological, cytogenetic, and histological parameters, significant differences were found between the \u00abclean burn\u00bb groups and the groups in which SPE was used in different concentrations and methods of application. The use of SPE in both concentrations contributed to a reduction in the area of burn wounds compared to a \u00abclean burn\u00bb. The survival rate of animals for 30 days (before the end of the experiment) was 100% when using a 12.75% SPE solution and 50% when using a 5% SPE solution. The use of SPE led to significant differences in hematological parameters from the \u00abclean burn\u00bb group throughout the entire duration of the experiment, showing a tendency to normalize the parameters. Under the influence of the 12.75% SPE solution, there was a tendency toward normalization of the mitotic index, along with a significant reduction in the percentage of polyploid cells and chromosomal aberrations, which may indicate its beneficial effects. This study found that a 12.75% SPE solution derived from raspberries was more effective and had healing properties on third-degree thermal burns, promoting rapid healing of the burn wound.",

    "abstract": "Application of microbial-based biopreparations as a pre-harvest strategy offers a method to obtain sustainable agricultural practices and could be an important approach for advancing food science, promoting sustainability, and meeting global food market demands. The impact of a bacterial-fungal biopreparation mixture on soil-plant-microbe interactions, fruit chemical composition and yield of 7 raspberry clones was investigated by examining the structural and functional profiles of microbial communities within leaves, fruits, and soil. Biopreparation addition caused the enhancement of the microbiological utilization of specific compounds, such as d-mannitol, relevant in plant-pathogen interactions and overall plant health. The biopreparation treatment positively affected the nitrogen availability in soil (9-160%). The analysis of plant stress marker enzymes combined with the evaluation of fruit quality and chemical properties highlight changes inducted by the pre-harvest biopreparation application. Chemical analyses highlight biopreparations' role in soil and fruit quality improvement, promoting sustainable agriculture. This effect was dependent on tested clones, showing increase of soluble solid content in fruits, concentration of polyphenols or the sensory quality of the fruits. The results of the next-generation sequencing indicated increase in the effective number of bacterial species after biopreparation treatment. The network analysis showed stimulating effect of biopreparation on microbial communities by enhancing microbial interactions (increasing the number of network edges up to 260%) of and affecting the proportions of mutual relationships between both bacteria and fungi. These findings show the potential of microbial-based biopreparation in enhancing raspberry production whilst promoting sustainable practices and maintaining environmental homeostasis and giving inshght in holistic understanding of microbial-based approaches for advancing food science monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry plants need intensive anti-fungal protection. A solution to this problem could be the application of an ozonation process. For this purpose, a technical solution was proposed and implemented in raspberry plant production. The proposal suggests replacing 25% of standard fungicide treatments with ozonation. It was demonstrated that the use of ozone under the proposed conditions made it possible to maintain stable parameters of chlorophyll content and fluorescence (no significant differences), but the intensity of gas exchange was increased. The greatest differences were observed in the second measurement period (T2), when the plants were in the stage of most active development. Additionally, the content and profile of low-molecular-weight antioxidants and the microbial load were determined in the collected fruits. In periods T2 and T3, the proposed method caused a reduction reaching ~2 log cfu g",

    "abstract": "Hyperglycemia leads to increased oxidative stress in mitochondria, an abnormal activation of intracellular inflammatory signals, and mediate multiple dysfunctions. Raspberry ketone (RK) is an aromatic phenolic compound found in many plants and could contribute to weight loss, restore impaired glucose tolerance, and has antioxidant properties. In our investigation, RK could greatly prevent islet, brain and other tissue damage caused by hyperglycemia in a zebrafish model with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemia. Body weight, insulin level, and food intake indexes were also restored by RK. Using transcriptome profiling, we found that RK administration could significantly attenuate STZ-induced insulin synthesis and pancreatic secretion as well as alter protein and carbohydrate metabolism. Metabolomics analysis results showed that RK could also prevent STZ-induced metabolic disorders, such as adenosine and sphingolipid metabolism.

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone accounts for the characteristic aroma of the raspberry fruit. In order to explore the genes involved in raspberry ketone synthesis, the transcriptome in fruit tissues of two red raspberry varieties \"Polka\" and \"Orange legend\", were sequenced and 24213 single genes were obtained. As the red raspberry fruit ripening, genes involved in flavonoid and anthocyanin synthesis were up-regulated, while those associated with lignin synthesis were down-regulated. A gene (RinPKS4) highly related to raspberry ketone synthesis was identified by transcriptome analysis, and RinPKS4 gene was over-expressed in raspberry in order to further understand the function of RinPKS4 gene in raspberry ketone synthesis. The results showed that the gene expression level of RinPKS4 in the leaf tissues of a transgenic lines increased by about 4-fold and the content of raspberry ketone increased by 42.64% compared with the wide type. This study lays a theoretical foundation for further study on the synthesis and regulation of raspberry ketone in red raspberry.",

    "abstract": "Over the last 10 years, global raspberry production has increased by 47.89%, based mainly on the red raspberry species (Rubus idaeus). However, the black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis), although less consumed, is resistant to one of the most important diseases for the crop, the late leaf rust caused by Acculeastrum americanum fungus. In this context, genetic resistance is the most sustainable way to control the disease, mainly because there are no registered fungicides for late leaf rust in Brazil. Therefore, the aim was to understand the genetic architecture that controls resistance to late leaf rust in raspberries. For that, we used an interspecific multiparental population using the species mentioned above as parents, 2 different statistical approaches to associate the phenotypes with markers [GWAS (genome-wide association studies) and copula graphical models], and 2 phenotyping methodologies from the first to the 17th day after inoculation (high-throughput phenotyping with a multispectral camera and traditional phenotyping by disease severity scores). Our findings indicate that a locus of higher effect, at position 13.3 Mb on chromosome 5, possibly controls late leaf rust resistance, as both GWAS and the network suggested the same marker. Of the 12 genes flanking its region, 4 were possible receptors, 3 were likely defense executors, 1 gene was likely part of signaling cascades, and 4 were classified as nondefense related. Although the network and GWAS indicated the same higher effect genomic region, the network identified other different candidate regions, potentially complementing the genetic control comprehension.",

This approach facilitates the management of surface roughness at both single and dual scales through variations in surface functionalization temperature. We illustrated that adjusting the temperature of organosilanes functionalization on the surface allows for various reactions, such as the direct grafting of metallic precursors or their polymerization on the surface, resulting in the formation of large raspberry-like particles. We investigated the impact of nanoparticle concentration, functionalization duration, and reaction temperature on surface properties. Our results reveal that a concentration of 1.5\u00a0% SiO",

    "abstract": "Green deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are widely used to extract bioactive components from plant biomass; however, hydrophilic DES and bioactive component isolation methods have not been developed. In this study, we synthesized hydrophilic DES (CL-CA-DES) using citric acid and choline chloride. We combined this with environmentally friendly anion- and cation-exchange resin column chromatographic isolation methods. This approach extracted and isolated four polyphenolic compounds (catechins, epicatechins, procyanidin B1, and procyanidin B2) from raspberry root and efficiently recovered the hydrophilic DES. CL-CA-DES extracted significantly higher contents of catechin and procyanidin B2 from raspberry root compared to other solvents. It also extracted substantially higher contents of epicatechin compared to butyl alcohol, 70% ethanol, and water, but there was no significant difference when compared with acetone and ethyl acetate. Additionally, CL-CA-DES extracted significantly higher contents of procyanidin B1 compared to butyl alcohol, water, and ethyl acetate, with no significant difference when compared with 70% ethanol and acetone. The isolation efficiency of the bioactive components in the raspberry root extract by anion- and cation-exchange resin column chromatography was higher than that of the organic solvent extraction and precipitation generation methods, and the method was effective in recovering CL-CA-DES with a recovery rate higher than 60%. In conclusion, this study developed a new method for the efficient recovery of hydrophilic CL-CA-DES, which can be used for isolating polyphenolic compounds from raspberry root.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the therapeutic effects of raspberry have been the subject of several randomized control trials (RCTs). However, there is no consensus about the effect of raspberry consumption on anthropometric indices and liver function tests. So, the present review aims to investigate this effectiveness by conducting a meta-analysis.\nPubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched to identify eligible randomized control trials (RCTs) up to March 2024. The overall effect sizes were estimated using the random-effects model as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nNine studies (10 arms) with 355 participants were eligible for inclusion in this review. This meta-analysis showed that raspberry consumption did not lead to significant changes in anthropometric indices (weight, body mass index, and waist circumference) and liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase).\nThis review revealed that raspberry consumption had no significant impact on anthropometric indices or liver function tests. However, more RCTs with a larger sample size and higher sensitivity are needed to draw definite conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry (Rubus corchorifolius) plants hold historical, economic, and medicinal importance in China (Yang et al. 2022). Raspberries are cultivated to generate income for local farmers in Lintao County, Dingxi City, Gansu Province. However, farmers encountered challenges due to raspberry plants exhibiting root rot disease, resulting in plant death. During a thorough field survey conducted in June 2022, symptoms ranging from leaf yellowing and wilting to necrotic lesions and root rots were observed, where approximately 30% of raspberry plants were affected. Five diseased and healthy plants were collected from the farmers' fields in Lintao (35.53oN, 103.84oE) for pathogen identification. Symptomatic and asymptomatic root tissues were surface sterilized with 75% ethanol for 30 s and 3% NaOCl for 5 min, followed by three rinses in sterile water. Small pieces (0.5 \u00d7 0.5 cm) were cut and incubated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates at 25\u00b0C for 7-10 days. Twenty-two pure Fusarium isolates, which displayed four distinct colony groups morphologically, were obtained. Pathogenicity tests on isolates RB10, RB1, RB30, and RB23, representing each colony group, revealed that RB10 exhibited symptoms similar to those observed in the field. The RB10 strain produced yellowish-white to greyish-white colonies on PDA and was then cultured in a carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) broth for enhanced conidia production (Zhang et al. 2020). Macroconidia were sickle-shaped or slightly curved, with three to five septa (19.2 to 38.5 x 3.1 to 5.8 \u00b5m, n =40). Microconidia were oval to ellipsoidal, non-septate or featuring 1 to 2 septa (4.8 to 10.5 x 2.1 to 5.2 \u00b5m, n=20). These morphological features indicated the isolate was similar to Fusarium avenaceum (Leslie and Summerell, 2006). For further identification of the strains, genomic regions (ITS-rDNA, TEF-1\u03b1, and RPB2) were amplified and sequenced using specific primers ITS1/ITS4, EF-1/EF-2, and 5f2/7cr, respectively (O'Donnell et al. 2010; Uwaremwe et al. 2021; Zarrin et al. 2016). PCR BLASTn queries of NCBI GenBank revealed a 99.8% (522 bp), 99.4% (355 bp) and 99.6% (985 bp) homology with F. avenaceum (MZ724839.1, MN271631.1, and MK185026.1), respectively. Sequences were deposited in GenBank (ITS, OR735571; TEF-1\u03b1, PP216660; RPB2, PP857820). One-year-old raspberry seedlings were planted in pots with a sterile soil mix (2:2:1 v/v ratio of soil, peat, and vermiculite) under controlled greenhouse conditions (23-26\u00b0C, 16h light/8h dark). A month post-planting, taproots were wounded in six pots and inoculated with 20 ml of conidia suspension (106 conidia/ml), while the other six pots were maintained as controls. After 14 days, RB10-infected plants showed symptoms similar to field observations, while controls remained healthy. The experiment was conducted twice, and re-isolation confirmed both the pathogenicity and identity of the pathogen. In the concatenated phylogenetic tree of ITS, TEF-1\u03b1 and RPB2, strain RB10 was clustered with the F. avenaceum representative strains KG502, KG431 and F094. Studies revealed F. avenaceum varied pathogenicity across plants (Bugingo, 2022; Moparthi et al. 2020& 2024; Yli-Mattila et al. 2018), and it has been reported to induce raspberry fruit rot (Wang et al. 2017). However, no previous reports linked this fungus to raspberry root rot. This report is crucial for understanding the impact of root rot disease on raspberry cultivation and developing effective management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Fruits are perishable, thus it's crucial to have an efficient preservation technique that can increase storage time while keeping physical quality and nutritional attributes in order to avoid wastage. The majority of methods for long-term storage require refrigeration.\nIn this investigation, we assess the viability of isochoric freezing as a different technique of raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) preservation. Raspberries were subjected to different storage conditions: isochoric freezing at -4\u00b0C, conventional isobaric settings at +3\u00b0C (refrigerator), -21\u00b0C (freezer), and -4\u00b0C with a trehalose solution in a plastic bag. The study assessed changes in weight loss, visual appearance, color, hardness, \u00b0Brix values, and pH over a seven-day period.\nKey findings reveal that raspberries subjected to isochoric freezing below the freezing point of water experienced minimal weight loss after seven days. Visual appearance, color, hardness, \u00b0Brix values, and pH were comparable to fresh raspberries, indicating minimal alteration.\nThese results suggest that isochoric freezing shows potential as a preservation method that maintains the physical and chemical properties of raspberries similar to fresh fruit. Implementing diverse preservation techniques tailored to raspberries may contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing food wastage and the associated environmental impact.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a simple and accurate approach is proposed for enhancing the origin identification of raspberry samples using a combination of innovative Raman spectral preprocessing techniques, feature selection, and machine learning algorithms. Window function was creatively introduced and combined with baseline removal technique to preprocess the Raman spectral data, reducing the dimensionality of the raw data and ensuring the quality of the processed data. An optimization process was conducted to determine the optimal parameter for the window function, resulting in a binning window width of 5 that yielded the highest accuracy. After applying three feature selection techniques, it was found that the information gain model had the best performance in extracting discriminative spectral features. Finally, ten different machine learning algorithms were employed to construct predictive models, and the optimal models were selected. Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC), Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier (MLPClassifier), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) achieve accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 values above 0.96, while the Random Vector Functional Link Network Classifier (RVFLClassifier) surpasses 0.93 for these performance metrics. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying the origin of raspberry samples with high accuracy and robustness, providing a valuable tool for agricultural product authentication and quality control.",

    "abstract": "Natural biosorbents from agricultural side stream products are being investigated due to their large surface area and capacity for various compounds. The aim of the present work was to investigate the raspberry seeds and their sorption potential in the recovery of natural pigments. The experiment included raspberry seed and a liquid by-phase rich in anthocyanins initially collected during the depulping of the raspberry seed material. Biosorption was monitored by LC-MS analysis of the anthocyanins and by the total anthocyanin content (TAC) before and after biosorption. Cyanidins predominated in the seed material, followed by pelargonidins and peonidins. The efficiency of biosorption was examined by comparing the percent of removal. The heterogeneous polymer structure of the biosorbent, which consists mainly of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose, was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman Spectroscopy (RS). The FTIR spectra of raw and defatted seed indicated functional groups involved in biosorption and principal component analysis (PCA) performed on Raman spectra pointed to differences among biosorbents. The developed strategy for the valorization of raspberry seeds in the recovery of natural colorants was shown to be effective, with recoveries from 49 to 88 percent of total anthocyanins.",

    "abstract": "With glossy, wax-coated leaves, Rubus leucanthus is one of the few heat-tolerant wild raspberry trees. To ascertain the underlying mechanism of heat tolerance, we generated a high-quality genome assembly with a genome size of 230.9 Mb and 24,918 protein-coding genes. Significantly expanded gene families were enriched in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and the circadian rhythm-plant pathway, enabling survival in subtropical areas by accumulating protective flavonoids and modifying photoperiodic responses. In contrast, plant-pathogen interaction and MAPK signaling involved in response to pathogens were significantly contracted. The well-known heat response elements (HSP70, HSP90, and HSFs) were reduced in R. leucanthus compared to two other heat-intolerant species, R. chingii and R. occidentalis, with transcriptome profiles further demonstrating their dispensable roles in heat stress response. At the same time, three significantly positively selected genes in the pathway of cuticular wax biosynthesis were identified, and may contribute to the glossy, wax-coated leaves of R. leucanthus. The thick, leathery, waxy leaves protect R. leucanthus against pathogens and herbivores, supported by the reduced R gene repertoire in R. leucanthus (355) compared to R. chingii (376) and R. occidentalis (449). Our study provides some insights into adaptive divergence between R. leucanthus and other raspberry species on heat tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Azo compounds, particularly azo dyes, are widely used but pose significant environmental risks due to their persistence and potential to form carcinogenic by-products. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are effective in degrading these stubborn compounds, with Oxone activation being a particularly promising method. In this study, a unique nanohybrid material, raspberry-like CuCo alloy embedded carbon (RCCC), is facilely fabricated using CuCo-glycerate (Gly) as a template. With the incorporation of Cu into Co, RCCC is essentially different from its analogue derived from Co-Gly in the absence of Cu, affording a popcorn-like Co embedded on carbon (PCoC). RCCC exhibits a unique morphology, featuring a hollow spherical layer covered by nanoscale beads composed of CuCo alloy distributed over carbon. Therefore, RCCC significantly outperforms PCoC and Co",

    "abstract": "The adoption of the European Green Deal will limit acaricide use in high value crops like raspberry, to be replaced by biological control and other alternative strategies. More basic knowledge on mites in such crops is then necessary, like species, density, and their role as vectors of plant diseases. This study had four aims, focusing on raspberry leaves at northern altitude: (1) identify mite species; (2) study mite population densities; (3) investigate mite intra-plant distribution; (4) investigate co-occurrence of phytophagous mites, raspberry leaf blotch disorder and raspberry leaf blotch virus (RLBV). Four sites in south-eastern Norway were sampled five times. Floricanes from different parts of the sites were collected, taking one leaf from each of the upper, middle, and bottom zones of the cane. Mites were extracted with a washing technique and processed for species identification and RLBV detection. Mites and leaves were tested for RLBV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with virus-specific primers. Phytophagous mites, Phyllocoptes gracilis, Tetranychus urticae, and Neotetranychus rubi, and predatory mites, Anystis baccarum and Typhlodromus (Typhlodromus) pyri were identified. All phytophagous mites in cultivated raspberry preferred the upper zone of floricanes, while in non-cultivated raspberry, they preferred the middle zone. The presence of phytophagous mites did not lead to raspberry leaf blotch disorder during this study. RLBV was detected in 1.3% of the sampled plants, none of them with leaf blotch symptoms, and in 4.3% of P. gracilis samples, and in some spider mite samples, implying that Tetranychids could also be vectors of RLBV.",

    "abstract": "Artificial enzymes with high stability, adjustable catalytic activity, controllable preparation, and good reproducibility have been widely studied. Noble metal nanozymes, particularly gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), exhibit good catalytic activity, but their stability is poor. In this study, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) was used as a carrier for Au NPs, thus improving the utilization efficiency and conservation stability of the nanozymes. A ZIF-8/Au nanocomposite with peroxidase activity and a raspberry-shaped structure was synthesized. In the assay, ZIF-8/Au catalyzed the oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a blue product oxidized TMB (oxTMB). Glutathione (GSH) selectively inhibited this reaction, with a detection limit of 0.28\u00a0\u00b5M and linear range of 0.5-60\u00a0\u00b5M. Using the photo and chromaticity analysis functions, we developed a portable analysis method using a smartphone equipped with a camera module as a detection terminal for a wide range of rapid screening techniques for GSH. Preparation of raspberry-shaped ZIF-8/Au improved the catalytic activity of Au NPs and good results were demonstrated in serum, which suggests their promising application under physiological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Despite observing the health benefits of raspberry consumption in some recent studies, there is still no consensus regarding this effectiveness on inflammatory markers and glycemic control. This study aimed to investigate this effectiveness by performing a meta-analysis. The PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were comprehensively searched until December 2023 to find relevant randomized controlled trials. Eligible studies were screened, and relevant information was extracted. The overall effect size of raspberry consumption on each of the outcomes was estimated by following the random-effects model in the form of a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a weighted mean difference (WMD). Raspberry consumption led to a significant increase in insulin concentrations (WMD: 1.89 \u03bcU/mL; 95%CI: 1.45, 2.34; ",

    "abstract": "Pickering emulsions seem to be an effective strategy for encapsulation and stabilization of essential oils. In this work, a novel raspberry-liked Pickering emulsion (RPE) loading Mosla chinensis 'Jiangxiangru' essential oil (MJO) was successfully engineered by using ethyl lauroyl arginate (ELA) decorated nanosilica (ELA-NS) as particles emulsifier. And the ELA-NS-stabilized MJO Pickering emulsion (MJO-RPE) was further prepared into inulin-based microparticles (MJO-RPE-IMP) by spray-drying, using inulin as matrix formers. The concentration of ELA-NS could affect the formation and stabilization of MJO-RPE, and the colloidal behavior of ELA-NS could be modulated at the interfaces with concentration of ELA, thus providing unique role on stabilization of MJO-RPE. The results indicated that the MJO-RPE stabilized ELA-NS with 2\u00a0% NS modified by 0.1\u00a0% ELA had long-term stability. MJO-RPE exhibited a raspberry-liked morphology on the surface, attributed to ELA-NS covered in the droplet surface. The inulin-based matrix formers could effectively prevent MJO-RPE from agglomeration or destruction during spray-drying, and 100\u00a0% concentration of inulin based microparticles formed large composite particles with high loading capacity (98.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.11\u00a0%) and exhibited superior thermal stability and redispersibility of MJO-RPE. The MJO-RPE exhibited strong antibacterial efficacy against Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), owing to the adhesion to bacterial membrane dependent on the raspberry-liked surface of MJO-RPE, whose minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the above three bacteria were (0.3, 0.45, and 1.2\u00a0\u03bcL/mL), respectively, lower than those (0.45, 0.6 and 1.2\u00a0\u03bcL/mL) of MJO. Therefore, the Pickering emulsion composite microparticles seemed to be a promising strategy for enhancing the stability and antibacterial activity of MJO.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberry fruit color is a key driver of consumer preference and a major target of breeding programs worldwide. Screening for fruit color typically involves the determination of anthocyanin content and/or the assessment of color through a colorimeter. However, both procedures are time-consuming when the analyses involve hundreds or thousands of samples. The objectives of this study were to develop a high-throughput method for red raspberry puree color measurement and to test the correlations between color parameters and total anthocyanin content. Color coordinates were collected with a colorimeter on 126 puree samples contained in Petri dishes and with the Tomato Analyzer Color Test (TACT) module to assess the same samples prepared in Petri dishes and in 96-well plates. An additional 425 samples were analyzed using only 96-well plates. Total anthocyanins were extracted from all 551 samples.\nRegression models for L*, a*, b* measured with the colorimeter and TACT using Petri dishes were all significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001), but very consistent only for L* (R\nWhile the colorimeter and TACT-based methods were not fully interchangeable, TACT better captured color differences among raspberry genotypes than the colorimeter. The correlations between color parameters measured with TACT and total anthocyanins were not strong enough to develop prediction models, yet the use of TACT with 96-well plates instead of Petri dishes would enable the high-throughput measurement of red raspberry puree color.",

    "abstract": "The fruit processing industry generates large quantities of by-products well known to be rich in bioactive compounds with numerous nutritional properties and beneficial effects for human health. We developed a strategy to valorise raspberry seeds and obtain valuable ingredients with potential application in cosmetic skincare formulas. Cold press extraction technology was applied to extract oil, and the remaining defatted raspberry seed cake was treated with three proline based deep eutectic solvents (DES) to extract polyphenols. The most potent was proline/citric acid extract, with free and total ellagic acid content (52.4 mg/L and 86.4 mg/L), total phenolic content (TPC, 550.1 mg GAE/L) and radical scavenging activity (RSA, 4742.7 mmol TE/L). After the direct mixing of the extract and after encapsulation with starch as a carrier, the skincare emulsion and microemulsion were characterised by irritation potential (Zein test), transepidermal water loss (TEWL), red blood cell (RBC), and DPPH antioxidant test. The resulting preparations were of improved quality in comparison to the control hand cream, with a low skin irritation effect, lower TEWL, and higher antioxidant potential. This work complies with circular economy principles and green technology standards, and represents the efficient model on how to reuse natural resources through waste minimization.",

    "abstract": "Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients face an almost certain 100% risk of developing colorectal cancer, necessitating prophylactic colectomy to prevent disease progression. A crucial goal is to hinder this progression. In a recent clinical trial involving 14 FAP patients, half received 60 g of black raspberry (BRB) powder orally and BRB suppositories at bedtime, while the other half received only BRB suppositories at bedtime over 9 months. This intervention led to a notable reduction in rectal polyps for 11 patients, although 3 showed no response. In this study, we delved into the metabolic changes induced by BRBs in the same patient cohort. Employing mass spectrometry-based non-targeted metabolomics, we analyzed pre- and post-BRB urinary and plasma samples from the 11 responders. The results showed significant alterations in 23 urinary and 6 plasma metabolites, influencing various pathways including polyamine, glutathione metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, inositol metabolism, and benzoate production. BRBs notably elevated levels of several metabolites associated with these pathways, suggesting a potential mechanism through which BRBs facilitate rectal polyp regression in FAP patients by modulating multiple metabolic pathways. Notably, metabolites derived from BRB polyphenols were significantly increased post-BRB intervention, emphasizing the potential therapeutic value of BRBs in FAP management.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing trend towards enhancing the post-harvest shelf life and maintaining the nutritional quality of horticultural products using eco-friendly methods. Raspberries are valued for their diverse array of phenolic compounds, which are key contributors to their health-promoting properties. However, raspberries are prone to a relatively short post-harvest lifespan. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of exogenous melatonin (MEL; 0, 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1\u00a0mM) on decay control and shelf-life extension. The results demonstrated that MEL treatment significantly reduced the fruit decay rate (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01). Based on the findings, MEL treatment significantly increased titratable acidity (TA), total phenolics content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total anthocyanin content (TAC). Furthermore, the MEL-treated samples showed increased levels of rutin and quercetin content, as well as antioxidant activity as measured by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reduction activity potential (FRAP). Additionally, the samples exhibited higher levels of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and catalase (CAT) enzymes compared to the control samples. Moreover, the levels of pH, total soluble solids (TSS), and IC",

    "abstract": "Concentration of fruit pulp is an important unit operation in food processing and has a wide range of applications. In this study, the microwave heating concentration (MHC) of raspberry pulp at different microwave powers, heating times and sample masses were investigated considering concentration characteristics and quality attributes. The results showed that increasing microwave power/heating time or decreasing sample mass significantly decreased the moisture content but had no significant effect on the temperature of raspberry pulp, while these conditions resulted in loss of total anthocyanin content and deterioration of total color difference. LF-NMR and SEM results revealed that the changes in temperature and moisture content caused by MHC significantly affected the total anthocyanin content and total color difference of the final product. Microwave power of 800\u00a0W, heating time of 3\u00a0min and sample mass of 90\u00a0g are selected as suitable parameters for MHC of raspberry pulp. This study may provide guidance for the development of appropriate technology for MHC of berry pulp.",

    "abstract": "Depression, a prevalent mental disorder, has significantly impacted the lives of 350 million people, yet it holds promise for amelioration through food-derived phenolics. Raspberries, renowned globally for their delectable flavor, harbor a phenolic compound known as raspberry ketone (RK). However, the impact of RK on depressive symptoms remains ambiguous. This study aims to investigate the impact of RK on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressed mice and elucidates its potential mechanisms, focusing on the gut-brain axis.\nThrough behavioral tests, RK exerts a notable preventive effect on LPS-induced depression-like behaviors in mice. RK proves capable of attenuating gut inflammation, repairing gut barrier impairment, modulating the composition of the gut microbiome (Muribaculaceae, Streptococcus, Lachnospiraceae, and Akkermansia), and promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids. Furthermore, RK alleviates neuroinflammation by suppressing the TLR-4/NF-\u03baB pathway and bolsters synaptic function by elevating levels of neurotrophic factors and synapse-associated proteins.\nThe current study provides compelling evidence that RK effectively inhibits the TLR-4/NF-\u03baB pathway via the gut-brain axis, leading to the improvement of LPS-induced depression-like behaviors in mice. This study addresses the research gap in understanding the antidepressant effects of RK and illuminates the potential of utilizing RK as a functional food for preventing depression.",

The intention was to create active films for food packaging where antioxidants in a film would deactivate oxidants in a packed product or its surroundings, improving conditions inside packaging and extending the shelf life of such a product. The prepared materials were characterized by physicochemical, spectroscopic, mechanical, water vapor transmission (WVTR), and antioxidant activity analysis. Infrared spectra of the alginate films with oils were similar to those without the additive; the band with a maximum at about 1740 cm",

    "abstract": "Red berries have gained popularity as functional and nutritious food due to their health benefits, leading to increased consumer demand and higher production, totaling over 11,000\u00a0ktons for strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries combined in 2021. Nutritionally, strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries present high levels of vitamin C (9.7-58.8\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g dry weight [dw]), folates (6-24\u00a0\u00b5g/100\u00a0g dw), and minerals (96-228\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g dw). Due to their perishable nature, producers have utilized alcoholic fermentation to extend their shelf life, not only increasing the lifespan of red berries but also attracting consumers through the production of novel beverages. Strawberry, blueberry, and raspberry wines possess low alcohol (5.5-11.1% v/v), high acidity (3.2-17.6\u00a0g/L), and interesting bioactive molecules such as phenolic compounds, carotenoids, polysaccharides, and melatonin. Distillation holds tremendous potential for reducing food waste by creating red berry spirits of exceptional quality. Although research on red berry spirits is still in the early stages, future studies should focus on their production and characterization. By incorporating these factors, the production chain would become more sustainable, profitable, and efficient by reducing food waste, capitalizing on consumer acceptance, and leveraging the natural health-promoting characteristics of these products. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of strawberry, blueberry, and red raspberry in berries, wines, and spirits, with a focus on their chemical composition and production methods.",

    "abstract": "An investigation of the ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of polyphenol-rich aqueous extracts from blackberry, chokeberry and raspberry pomaces was carried out. The aim of the study was to choose optimal conditions for UAE in order to obtain extracts rich in phenolic compounds. The optimization was carried out based on response surface methodology. The variable conditions were amplitude of ultrasound wave and extraction time, whereas responses were total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity. Based on the ANOVA analysis, mathematical models were fitted and verified. The most effective conditions of amplitude and time were 98% and 5.00 min, 78% and 10.32 min and 90% and 11.56 min for blackberry pomace, chokeberry pomace and raspberry pomace, respectively. The actual results obtained in optimized conditions were comparable to the results predicted by the models. Additionally, the anthocyanin content in extracts was determined in the high-performance liquid chromatography assay. It was proven that response surface methodology could be a useful tool in the optimization of UAE processes for obtaining polyphenol-rich extracts from berry fruit pomaces.",

    "abstract": "Raspberries are known to contain valuable metabolites and possess a robust antioxidant capacity. However, the impact of different tablet processing stages on the nutritional content and flavor profile of raspberries remains unclear. The dynamic profile of functional and volatile metabolites was investigated through foodomics combined with UPLC-MS/MS-based widely targeted metabolomics and HS-SPME-GC-MS, and antioxidant capacities were assessed during tablet processing. 1336 functional metabolites and 645 volatile metabolites were identified. Results indicated tablets retained 34%\u00a0\u223c\u00a061% of the total volatile contents. In addition, the conversion intensity of functional metabolites was consistent with the order of \"Tableting > Freeze-drying > Crushing\". Compared to raspberry, tablets showed higher antioxidant activity, which was positively correlated with vitamin contents. This study elucidated that tablet formation demonstrated advantages in antioxidation and aroma retention, which may provide insights for enhancing quality during the tableting process.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry leaf use during pregnancy in Australia is widespread. There has been little research exploring the potential beneficial or harmful effects of raspberry leaf on pregnancy, labour, and birth. More research is needed to appropriately inform childbearing women and maternity healthcare professionals on the effects of raspberry leaf so that women can make informed choices.\nThis study aimed to determine associations between raspberry leaf use in pregnancy and augmentation of labour and other secondary outcomes. Data was derived from questionnaires which captured demographic information and herbal use in pregnancy. Clinical outcomes were accessed from the maternity services' clinical database. Data analysis was conducted in R via package 'brms' an implementation for Bayesian regression models.\nA total of 91 completed records were obtained, 44 exposed to raspberry leaf and 47, not exposed. A smaller proportion of women in the raspberry leaf cohort had augmentation of labour, epidural anaesthesia, instrumental births, caesarean section, and postpartum haemorrhage. A larger proportion had vaginal birth and length of all phases of labour were shorter. Under these conditions the use of raspberry leaf was strongly predictive of women not having their labours medically augmented.\nWhile our study demonstrated that raspberry leaf was strongly predictive of women not having their labours medically augmented, the results cannot be relied on or generalised to the wider population of pregnant women. While there were no safety concerns observed in our study, this should not be taken as evidence that raspberry leaf is safe. A randomised controlled trial is urgently needed to provide women and healthcare providers with robust evidence on which to base practice.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have highlighted the beneficial effects of consuming red raspberries on human health thanks to their high content of phytochemicals. However, the products used in these studies, both in the raw or freeze-dried form, were not fully characterized for nutrient and phytochemical composition. In this study, we aimed to determine the nutrient and non-nutrient compounds present in a freeze-dried red raspberry powder widely used by the food industry and consumers. The main sugars identified were fructose (12%), glucose (11%), and sucrose (11%). Twelve fatty acids were detected, with linoleic acid (46%), \u03b1-linolenic acid (20%), and oleic acid (15%) being the most abundant. Regarding micronutrients, vitamin C was the main hydro-soluble vitamin, while minerals, potassium, phosphorous, copper and magnesium were the most abundant, with concentrations ranging from 9 up to 96 mg/100 g, followed by manganese, iron and zinc, detected in the range 0.1-0.9 mg/100 g. Phytochemical analysis using UHPLC-DAD-HR-MS detection revealed the presence of Sanguiin H6 (0.4%), Lambertianin C (0.05%), and Sanguiin H-10 isomers (0.9%) as the main compounds. Among anthocyanins, the most representative compounds were cyanidin-3-sophoroside, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside. Our findings can serve as a reliable resource for the food industry, nutraceutical applications and for future investigations in the context of human health.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates if inexpensive computer hardware, open-source computer vision and a phosphor screen from disused CR (computed radiography) Cassette can be used to quantitatively assess beam shape and area.\nThe phosphor screen was affixed to a Carestream CS 8100 dental OPG system and the camera was mounted above the X-ray tube. Videos were acquired of the green light emissions during the tomographic irradiation. Images of a chessboard pattern, attached to the detector were used to correct for camera angulation and provide image pixel size calibration. K-Means colour clustering was used to define beam area. The effect of light conditions on beam dimension measurement was also investigated. The beam width measurement from optimised methodology was compared with that determined from dose calibrated GAFChromic\nVideos in dark conditions provided the most reproducible results. FW20M gained from initial sampling matched that obtained using the GAFChromic\nThe potential of this low-cost open-source method of beam area measurement using computer vision is thus proven.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry production is under threat from the emerging fungal pathogenic genus Cladosporium. We used amplicon-sequencing, coupled with qPCR, to investigate how fruit age, fruit location within a polytunnel, polytunnel location and sampling date affected the fruit epiphytic microbiome. Fruit age was the most important factor impacting the fungal microbiome, followed by sampling date and polytunnel location. In contrast, polytunnel location and fruit age were important factors impacting the bacterial microbiome composition, followed by the sampling date. The within-tunnel location had a small significant effect on the fungal microbiome and no effect on the bacterial microbiome. As fruit ripened, fungal diversity increased and the bacterial diversity decreased. Cladosporium was the most abundant fungus of the fruit epiphytic microbiome, accounting for nearly 44% of all fungal sequences. Rotorod air samplers were used to study how the concentration of airborne Cladosporium inoculum (quantified by qPCR) varied between location (inside and outside the polytunnel) and time (daytime vs. nighttime). Quantified Cladosporium DNA was significantly higher during the day than the night and inside the polytunnel than the outside. This study demonstrated the dynamic nature of epiphytic raspberry fruit microbiomes and airborne Cladosporium inoculum within polytunnels, which will impact disease risks on raspberry fruit.",

    "abstract": "We describe a Raspberry Pi-based camera system that is portable, robust and weatherproof, with a close-up focus (2.5\u2009cm). We show that this camera system can be used in remote locations with high rainfall and humidity. The camera has an Infrared LED light to film in dark places and can continuously record up to 21\u2009days (504\u2009h). We also describe how to make concrete artificial shelters to mount the camera in. One of the great strengths of this shelter/camera set-up is that the animals choose to take up residence and can then be filmed for extended periods with no disturbance. Furthermore, we give examples of how shelters and cameras could be used to film a range of behaviours in not only many small cryptic amphibian species but also other small vertebrates and invertebrates globally.",

    "abstract": "Intensive crop production leads to the disruption of the symbiosis between plants and their associated microorganisms, resulting in suboptimal plant productivity and lower yield quality. Therefore, it is necessary to improve existing methods and explore modern, environmentally friendly approaches to crop production. One of these methods is biotization, which involves the inoculation of plants with appropriately selected symbiotic microorganisms which play a beneficial role in plant adaptation to the environment. In this study, we tested the possibility of using a multi-microorganismal inoculum composed of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and AMF spore-associated bacteria for biotization of the red raspberry.\u00a0Bacteria were isolated from the spores of AMF, and their plant growth-promoting properties were tested. AMF inocula were supplemented with selected bacterial strains to investigate their effect on the growth and vitality of the raspberry. The investigations were carried out in the laboratory and on a semi-industrial scale in a polytunnel where commercial production of seedlings is carried out. In the semi-industrial experiment, we tested the growth parameters of plants and physiological response of the plant to temporary water shortage.\u00a0We isolated over fifty strains of bacteria associated with spores of AMF. Only part of them showed plant growth-promoting properties, and six of these (belonging to the Paenibacillus genus) were used for the inoculum. AMF inoculation and co-inoculation of AMF and bacteria isolated from AMF spores improved plant growth and vitality in both experimental setups. Plant dry weight was improved by 70%, and selected chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (the contribution of light to primary photochemistry and fraction of reaction centre chlorophyll per chlorophyll of the antennae) were increased. The inoculum improved carbon assimilation, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration after temporary water shortage. Raspberry biotization with AMF and bacteria associated with spores has potential applications in horticulture where ecological methods based on plant microorganism interaction are in demand.",

    "abstract": "A method to synthesize stable, raspberry-like nanoparticles (NPs), using surface grafting of poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) brushes on a polystyrene (PS) core with varying grafting densities, is reported. A two-step functionalization reaction of PGMA epoxide groups comprising an amination step first using ethylene diamine and then followed by a quaternization using glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride generates permanently and positively charged polyelectrolyte brushes, which result in both steric and electrostatic stabilization. The dispersion stability of the brush-bearing NPs is dramatically improved compared to that of the pristine PS core in salt solutions at ambient (25 \u00b0C) and elevated temperatures (60 \u00b0C). Additionally, the grafted polyelectrolyte chains undergo a reversible swelling in the presence of different ionic strength (IS) salts, which modulate the surface properties, including roughness, stiffness, and adhesion. An atomic force microscope under both dry and wet conditions was used to image conformational changes of the polyelectrolyte chains during the swelling and deswelling transitions as well as to probe the nanomechanical properties by analyzing the corresponding force-sample separation curves. The quaternized polyelectrolyte brushes undergo a conformational transition from a collapsed state to a swelled state in the osmotic brush (OB) regime triggered by the osmotic gradient of mobile ions to the interior of the polymer chain. At IS \u223c 1 M, the brushes contract and the globules reform (salted brush state) as evidenced by an increase in the surface roughness and a reduction in the adhesion of the brushes. Beyond IS \u223c 1 M, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring measurements show that salt uptake continues to take place predominantly on the exterior surface of the brush since salt adsorption is not accompanied by a size increase as measured by dynamic light scattering. The study adds new insights into our understanding of the behavior of NPs bearing salt-responsive polyelectrolyte brushes with adaptive swelling thresholds that can ultimately modulate surface properties.",

    "abstract": "The structure-activity relationship has been a hot topic in the field of polysaccharide research. Six polysaccharides and three polysaccharide fragments were obtained from raspberry pulp. Based on their structural information and immune-enhancing activity data, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was used for prediction, and Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) algorithm was exploited for explanation structure-activity relationship of these raspberry polysaccharides in the present study. The structural information and immune activity data of raspberry polysaccharides were respectively used as input and output in the ANN model. The training and testing losses of ANN model was no longer decreased after trained for 200 epochs. The mean-square error (MSE) of training set and test set stabilized around 0.003 and 0.013, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of training set and test set were 0.21\u00a0% and 0.98\u00a0%, indicating the trained ANN model converged well and exhibited strong robustness. The interpretability analysis showed that molecular weight, content of arabinose, galactose or galacturonic acid, and glycosyl linkage patterns of \u21923)-Arap-(1\u2192, Araf-(1\u2192, \u21924)-Galp-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0were the main structural factors greatly affecting the immune-enhancing activity of raspberry polysaccharides. This work may provide a new perspective for the study of structure-activity relationship of polysaccharides.",

    "abstract": "Phenolic compounds are considered an important group of bioactive molecules that are present in abundant quantities in fruits such as berries and cherries; hence, the analysis and quantification of these compounds are of significant interest to the scientific community. The current study aimed to develop a novel analytical method using liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) for the rapid, comprehensive and simultaneous analysis of 66 phenolic compounds optimized for the selected five types of fruits commercially available in Canada. Bioactive compounds that could potentially be metabolite markers for each berry were identified. Various phenolic compounds were identified and quantified in all five selected fruits. Notably, blackberries were rich in anthocyanins such as cyanidin-3-glucoside (368.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0\u00b5g/g), while blueberries were rich in peonidin-3-glucoside (1083\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09\u00a0\u00b5g/g). In addition, raspberries and cherries contained significant amounts of cyanidin-3-rutinoside, at 3156\u00a0\u00b1\u00a036\u00a0\u00b5g/g and 301.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u00b5g/g, respectively, while cranberries contained the highest concentrations of petunidin at 829.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0\u00b5g/g. The newly developed and validated UHPLC-HRMS method proved helpful in comprehensively analyzing phenolic compounds in blueberry, raspberry, cranberry, blackberry and cherry. Identifying and quantifying bioactives can lead to applications in neutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries by using phenolic-rich berry extracts in functional foods, supplements, or pharmaceutical products.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry leaves were subjected to steam explosion at 0.5 and 1.0\u00a0MPa for 60-120\u00a0s, aiming to disrupt their physical and chemical structure and, consequently, promote the release of phenolic compounds into the leaf aqueous infusion. Under optimal condition of 1.0\u00a0MPa for 60\u00a0s, steam explosion led to a notable 23\u00a0% increase in total phenolic content, a 29\u00a0% elevation in ABTS radical scavenging capacity, and a 13\u00a0% rise in DPPH radical scavenging capacity of the aqueous infusion. Utilizing UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS and UHPLC-QE-MS/MS techniques, respectively, a total of 39 phenolic compounds were identified from raspberry leaves, and the changes in the contents of the most important 11 species were analyzed following steam explosion. Through correlation analysis and considering the content of each phenolic compound, it was inferred that the heightened antioxidant capacity of the aqueous infusion primarily stemmed from a substantial increase in the release of ellagic acid after steam explosion.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is an important nectar source for honey production in some specific habitats as well as an important crop, so the definition of the features of this kind of honey is noteworthy. However, due to its rarity on the market, red raspberry honey is poorly characterized. The aim of this work was the phytochemical characterization of honey containing red raspberry from different geographical origins, through melissopalynological analyses concurrently with untargeted metabolomics achieved with different chromatographic techniques coupled to mass spectrometry: solid-phase micro-extraction/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography/Orbitrap mass spectrometry (HPLC-Orbitrap).\nOnly 4 out of the 12 samples involved in the study contained raspberry pollen as dominant pollen, although these honeys did not group in the hierarchical cluster analysis nor in the classical multidimensional scaling analyses used for data evaluation. The first result was the detection of mislabelling in two samples, which contained raspberry pollen only as minor or important minor pollen. Of the 188 compounds identified by HPLC-Orbitrap and of the 260 identified by SPME-GC-MS, 87 and 31 compounds were present in all samples, respectively. The structurally related compounds nicotinaldehyde and nicotinamide, nicotinic acid and nicotinyl alcohol were present in 100% of the samples and correlated with R. idaeus pollen count (r\u2009>\u20090.60, Pearson's correlation analysis).\nThis study reveals important aspects about the characterization of red raspberry honey and could give new insights on bee diet and preferences, since niacin compounds resulted interestingly to be related to the presence of red raspberry pollen. \u00a9 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and associated liver diseases are becoming global public health challenges. Raspberry (Rubus chingii Hu.), as a medicine food homology plant, possesses a series of health-promoting properties, but its protective effect on obesity-related liver injury and the potential mechanisms remain obscure. Herein high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice were orally treated with raspberry polysaccharides (RCP) for 14\u00a0weeks. Treatment with RCP alleviated obesity and associated symptoms including hyperglycemia, hyperlipemia, endotoxemia, as well as hepatic inflammation and oxidant stress in HFD-induced obese mice. RCP restructured the gut microbiota and host metabolism especially by increasing the levels of Dubosiella and its metabolite butyrate. Besides, exogenous butyrate supplementation protected against intestinal barrier disruption, and thereby reduced inflow of lipopolysaccharide and mitigated inflammation and oxidative injury in the liver of obese mice. Therefore, we suggest that RCP can be utilized as a novel prebiotics to improve obesity-induced hepatic oxidative injury by enhancing butyrate-mediated intestinal barrier function.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry, a traditional medicine food homology species, has important benefits in patients with metabolic syndrome. However, the mechanism of raspberry polysaccharides (RP) on obesity remains unclear. In our study, we showed that RP intervention is negatively associated with body weight gain, hyperlipidemia, inflammation, and fat accumulation in obese mice. RP ameliorated HFD-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, produced short-chain fatty acids, maintained intestinal barrier integrity, and prevented metabolic endotoxemia, manifested by decreased host lipopolysaccharide level, and increased colon expression of tight junction proteins. These effects might be related with driven by a SCFAs-producing bacterium and downregulation of TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling transduction. Notably, the abundance of Ruminococcaceae_UCG\u00a0-\u00a0014, Lactobacillus taiwanensis, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, and Turicibacter are markedly correlated with enhanced intestinal barrier function induced by RP treatment. Thus, we believe that RP could be as a potential health supplement or prebiotic for obesity therapy.",

    "abstract": "Pressure spray combined with high-voltage electrospray (PS-ES) has garnered considerable interest as a novel, non-thermal approach for microbial inactivation and preservation of liquid food. This study compared PS-ES with heat treatment (HT) to understand its inactivation mechanism against E. coli and S. aureus in a simulated system. Microbial activity, cell permeability, membrane integrity, membrane potential, and cell membrane structure were assessed. Furthermore, the impact of PS-ES treatment on microbial activity and flavor in honey raspberry juice, was examined. The changes in microbial growth and color during storage were also discussed. The experimental findings revealed that PS-ES treatment effectively reduced the number of E. coli and S. aureus by 1.99 and 1.83 log colony-forming units (CFU/mL). Additionally, it disrupted the integrity of bacterial cell membranes increasing their permeability, which led to the release of cellular proteins and nucleic acids. PS-ES treatment lowered the membrane potential and altered the structure of bacterial proteins. Application of PS-ES in honey raspberry juice reduced bacterial counts from 4.48 log CFU/mL to 1.99 log CFU/mL, with less flavor deterioration compared to HT treatment. After 30\u00a0days of storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and room temperature, PS-ES effectively controlled the growth of microorganisms in raspberry juice and maintained the color of the juice.",

    "abstract": "Cigarette smoke is a rich source of free radicals that can promote oxidative stress and carcinogenesis, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) development; importantly, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (8-isoprostane) are biomarkers of oxidative stress. Several mechanisms, including the antioxidant properties of black raspberry (BRB), account for their chemopreventive effects. In the present clinical trial, we tested the hypothesis that BRB administration reduces biomarkers levels of oxidative stress in buccal cells and urine of smokers. One week after enrolling 21 smokers, baseline buccal cells and urine samples were collected before the administration of BRB lozenges for 8 weeks (5/day, 1 gm BRB/lozenge). Buccal cells and urine samples were collected at the middle and the end of BRB administration. The last samples were collected after the BRB cessation (washout period). We analyzed levels of 8-oxodG and 8-isoprostane (LC/MS-MS), urinary cotinine (ELISA), and creatinine (spectrophotometry). BRB significantly reduced the levels of 8-oxodG by 17.08% (P = 0.00079) in buccal cells and 12.44% (P = 0.034) in urine at the middle of BRB administration as compared with baseline; the corresponding values at the end of BRB administration were 16.46% (P = 0.026) in buccal cells and 25.72% (P = 0.202) in urine. BRB had no significant effect on the levels of urinary 8-isoprostane. BRB's capacity to inhibit 8-oxodG formation of smokers' buccal cells and urine is clearly evident and the reduction in 8-oxodG suggests that antioxidant abilities are central to BRB's HNSCC chemopreventive properties.\nCigarette smoke contains highly active components namely free radicals that can promote oxidative stress and oral cancer. We found that black raspberry (BRB) inhibited the formation of oxidative stress markers in the oral cavity and urine of smokers suggesting the antioxidant abilities of BRB in preventing oral cancer.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is recognized as a chronic low-grade inflammation associated with intestinal flora imbalance, leading to dyslipidemia and inflammation. Modern research has found that polyphenols have anti-obesity effects. However, the mechanism of action of raspberry leaf extract (RLE) with high polyphenols in regulating obesity is still unknown. This study investigated the improvement effect of supplementing RLE on high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity in mice.\nRLE was used to intervene in HFD induced C57BL/6J male mice during prevention stage (1-16 weeks) and treatment stage (17-20 weeks). Their weight changes and obesity-related biochemical indicators were measured. The changes in intestinal flora were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing, and finally the targets and pathways of the 7 typical polyphenols (quercetin-3-O-glucuronide, ellagic acid, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, chlorogenic acid, brevifolin carboxylic acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, and quercetin) of RLE in the regulation of obesity were predicted by network pharmacology approach.\nThe results showed that RLE effectively prevented and treated weight gain in obese mice induced by HFD, alleviated adipocyte hypertrophy, reduced Interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha levels, and improved intestinal flora, especially \nThe potential mechanism by which polyphenol-rich RLE regulates obesity may be attributed to the specific polyphenols of RLE and their synergistic effects, therefore RLE has a great anti-obesity potential and may be used as a means to alleviate obesity and related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Rubus yellow net virus (RYNV) belongs to genus Badnavirus. Badnaviruses are found in plants as endogenous, inactive or activatable sequences, and/or in episomal (infectious and active) forms. To assess the state of RYNV in Rubus germplasm, we sequenced the genomes of various cultivars and mined eight raspberry whole genome datasets. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of a diverse array of endogenous RYNV (endoRYNV) sequences that differ significantly in their structure; some lineages have nearly complete, yet non-functional genomes whereas others have rudimentary, short sequence fragments. We developed assays to genotype the main lineages as well as the only known episomal lineage present in the United States. This study discloses the widespread presence of endoRYNVs in commercial raspberries, likely because breeding efforts have focused on a limited pool of germplasm that harbored endoRYNVs.",

These syndromes can lead to an increased risk of infection and may transform into acute myeloid leukemia, making it critical to determine effective treatments for the condition. While hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine and decitabine, as well as stem cell transplants, have been delineated as favored treatments for MDS, not all patients are physiologically receptive to these treatments. However, black raspberries (BRBs) have been shown to exert hypomethylating effects in various malignancies, with minimal adverse effects and thus a broader range of potential candidacies. This study aimed to investigate the potential of BRBs to exert such effects on MDS using ",

Investigations into their growth and development will promote both basic understanding and progress toward increasing fruit yield and quality.

Therefore, databases that enable easy access and effective utilization of directly comparable transcript data are highly desirable. Here, we describe a database for comparative analysis, ROsaceae Fruit Transcriptome database (ROFT), based on RNA-seq data generated from the same laboratory using similarly dissected and staged fruit tissues of four important Rosaceae fruit crops: apple, peach, strawberry, and red raspberry. Hence, the database is unique in allowing easy and robust comparisons among fruit gene expression across the four species. ROFT enables researchers to query orthologous genes and their expression patterns during different fruit developmental stages in the four species, identify tissue-specific and tissue-/stage-specific genes, visualize and compare ortholog expression in different fruit types, explore consensus co-expression networks, and download different data types. The database provides users access to vast amounts of RNA-seq data across the four economically important fruits, enables investigations of fruit type specification and evolution, and facilitates the selection of genes with critical roles in fruit development for further studies.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry plants, valued for their fruits, are vulnerable to a range of viruses that adversely affect their yield and quality. Utilizing high-throughput sequencing (HTS), we identified a novel virus, tentatively named raspberry enamovirus 1 (RaEV1), in three distinct raspberry plants. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of RaEV1, focusing on its genomic structure, phylogeny, and possible transmission routes. Analysis of nearly complete genomes from 14 RaEV1 isolates highlighted regions of variance, particularly marked by indel events. The evidence from phylogenetic and sequence analyses supports the classification of RaEV1 as a distinct species within the ",

    "abstract": "Approximately 650,000 new cases of heart failure (HF) are diagnosed annually with a 50% five-year mortality rate. HF is characterized by reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and hypertrophy of the LV wall. The pathophysiological remodeling of the heart is mediated by increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Raspberries are rich in polyphenols which may favorably impact enzymes involved in redox homeostasis while also targeting inflammatory signaling. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate whether raspberry polyphenols could attenuate HF. Sprague Dawley rats consumed a 10% (w/w) raspberry diet for 7 weeks. At week 3, HF was surgically induced via coronary artery ligation. Hemodynamics and morphology of the heart were assessed. Expression of cardiac proteins involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and remodeling were examined, and histological analysis was conducted. Additionally, human cardiomyocytes were treated with raspberry polyphenol extract (RBPE) followed by CoCl",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop, for the first time, anthocyanin-enriched fractions from black raspberry pomace (BRP) using ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) via sonotrode and the Particles from Gas-Saturated Solutions (PGSS) process. UAEs with different amplitudes and sonication times were evaluated and showed relevant effects on the yields of target analytes. The raspberry pomace extracts were formulated in a powder form by PGSS using glyceryl monostearate as a carrier at different extract-to-carrier ratios of 1:11, 1:5, and 1:3. The effects of all variables were evaluated in terms of extraction yield, total phenolic content, and encapsulation yield. UAE was strongly affected by amplitude, and the highest amplitude (100%) provided the best results for extraction yield and total phenolics. HPLC of UAE extracts and powders was utilized for quantification of polyphenol compounds, showing cyanidin-3-rutinoside as a main compound, followed by cyanidin-3-glucoside, rutin, ellagic acid, and gallic acid. These results show that these time-efficient and high-performance techniques enable the production of natural fractions from industrial BRP with acceptable characteristics to be used for the development of nutraceuticals and different food formulations.",

However, the addition of fermented products can affect the stability of fruit bioactive components in fruits, such as anthocyanins. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of varying yogurt additions (0, 10, 20, and 30%) on the stability of anthocyanins during a 4-week refrigerated storage period. The smoothies were obtained from purees of strawberry, raspberry, and blueberry, combined with apple juice and apple puree. In addition, to elucidate the causes of the observed changes in the smoothies, model studies were conducted using purified anthocyanin extracts obtained from the analyzed fruits. We assessed the effects of pH, hydrogen peroxide concentration, and the addition of cell-free extracts from ",

    "abstract": "An ultrasound-enzyme-assisted extraction (UEAE) was optimized to extract, simultaneously, the hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds from three berry pomaces (raspberry, strawberry and blackberry). First, an enzyme screening designated a thermostable alkaline protease as the most suitable enzyme to recover, in an aqueous medium, the highest yields of polyphenols and oil in the most efficient way. Secondly, the selected enzyme was coupled to ultrasounds (US) in sequential and simultaneous combinations. The simultaneous US-alkaline enzyme combination was selected as a one-single-step process and was then optimized by definitive screening design (DSD). The optimized parameters were: US amplitude, 20% (raspberry pomace) or 70% (strawberry and blackberry pomaces); pH, 8; E/S ratio, 1% (",

    "abstract": "The integration of Raspberry Pi miniature computer systems with microfluidics has revolutionised the development of low-cost and customizable analytical systems in life science laboratories. This review explores the applications of Raspberry Pi in microfluidics, with a focus on imaging, including microscopy and automated image capture. By leveraging the low cost, flexibility and accessibility of Raspberry Pi components, high-resolution imaging and analysis have been achieved in direct mammalian and bacterial cellular imaging and a plethora of image-based biochemical and molecular assays, from immunoassays, through microbial growth, to nucleic acid methods such as real-time-qPCR. The control of image capture permitted by Raspberry Pi hardware can also be combined with onboard image analysis. Open-source hardware offers an opportunity to develop complex laboratory instrumentation systems at a fraction of the cost of commercial equipment and, importantly, offers an opportunity for complete customisation to meet the users' needs. However, these benefits come with a trade-off: challenges remain for those wishing to incorporate open-source hardware equipment in their own work, including requirements for construction and operator skill, the need for good documentation and the availability of rapid prototyping such as 3D printing plus other components. These advances in open-source hardware have the potential to improve the efficiency, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness of microfluidic-based experiments and applications.",

    "abstract": "An electrochemical study of lyophilized blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) and raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) fruits was carried out using microparticulate deposits from ethanolic extracts of fruits in contact with different aqueous electrolytes. This voltammetry is dominated by the oxidation of anthocyanins. It was hypothesized that under conditions of electrochemical generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), new anthocyanin-derived species with high antioxidant capacity are formed over a wide pH range. In the case of ROS-activated anthocyanins, electrochemical oxidation is associated with loss of sugar moieties. Experimental voltammetric and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) imaging data consistent with this hypothesis are presented.",

    "abstract": "Strawberry cultivars Portola and Enduro, as well as raspberry cultivars Enrosadira and Kwazi, were evaluated for their antioxidant potential after treatment with gaseous ozone and different refrigeration storage conditions. Their antioxidant capacity was investigated with ABTS and DPPH methods, and the chemical composition was determined by measuring the total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoid (TFC) compounds. The classification of different samples of berry puree was influenced significantly by both the cultivars and the refrigeration storage method. Moreover, FTIR spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics was used as an alternative technique to conventional methods to determine the chemical composition of strawberries and raspberries. The chemometric discrimination of samples was achieved using principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) modelling procedures performed on the FTIR preprocessed spectral data for the fingerprint region (1800-500 cm",

    "abstract": "Point-of-care testing plays a crucial role in diagnostics within resource-poor areas, necessitating the utilization of portable and user-friendly devices. The adaptation of biosensors for point-of-care applications requires careful considerations, such as miniaturization, cost-effectiveness, and streamlined sample processing. In recent years, the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay has gained significant attention due to its visual detection capabilities and ability to facilitate high-throughput analysis. However, the development of a practical and cost-effective ECL device remains a challenging task. This study presents the development of an integrated MXene-modified single-electrode electrochemical system (SEES) for visual and high-throughput ECL immunoassays incorporating a Raspberry Pi system. The SEES was designed by affixing a plastic sticker with multiple perforations onto a single carbon ink screen-printed electrode, which operates based on a resistance-induced potential difference. Leveraging the excellent adsorption and bioaffinity properties of the carbon ink screen-printed electrode, effective immobilization of antibodies was achieved. Furthermore, the incorporation of Co-Pt nanoparticles enhanced the ECL intensity and electron transfer kinetics, enabling the sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2. The developed system comprised 18 individual reaction cells, allowing for simultaneous analysis while maintaining sample isolation. Impressively, the system achieved a remarkable minimum virus detection limit of 10",

    "abstract": "Raspberries (Rubus spp) are temperate climate fruits with profitable high returns and have the potential for diversification of fruit growing in mid to low-latitude regions. However, there are still no cultivars adapted to climatic conditions and high pressure of diseases that occurs in tropical areas. In this context, our objective was to evaluate the genetic diversity from a 116 raspberry genotypes panel obtained from interspecific crosses in a testcross scheme with four cultivars already introduced in Brazil. The panel was genotyped via genotyping-by-sequencing. 28,373 and 27,281 SNPs were obtained, using the species R. occidentalis and R. idaeus genomes as references, respectively. A third marker dataset was constructed consisting of 41,292 non-coincident markers. Overall, there were no differences in the results when using the different marker sets for the subsequent analyses. The mean heterozygosity was 0.54. The average effective population size was 174, indicating great genetic variability. The other analyses revealed that the half-sibling families were structured in three groups. It is concluded that the studied panel has great potential for breeding and further genetic studies. Moreover, only one of the three marker matrices is sufficient for diversity studies.",

    "abstract": "To improve the utilization value of raspberry leaves, the extraction and purification conditions of phenolic compounds from raspberry leaves were optimized, and the contents of phenolic compounds and the biological activities of extracts were studied. After steam explosion pretreatment at 115 \u00b0C for 15 min, raspberry leaf extract with a total phenolic content (TPC) of 136.30~140.51 mg GAE/g was obtained via homogenization and ultrasound-assisted extraction. In addition, the adsorption relationship between raspberry leaf polyphenols and middle polar XDA-6 macroporous resin was best described by the Langmuir model, and tended to be monolayer adsorption. Its adsorption kinetics best resembled the pseudo second-order kinetic model, and it was speculated that this was influenced by multiple factors. According to the optimal integrated extraction-purification process, the TPC of the extracts increased to 738.98 mg GAE/g after one application of purification and 905.27 mg GAE/g after two applications of purification. Moreover, the latter case showed the highest antioxidant activity and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition activity, and the content of the most typical compound, quercetin-3-glucuronide, reached 199.69 mg/g. SE has a double-edged effect, and is more conducive to the release of active substances as a pre-treatment method. This study provides a theoretical basis for the efficient use of raspberry leaves, further improving their medicinal and economic value.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone has generated interest in recent years both as a flavor agent and as a health promoting supplement. Raspberry ketone can be synthesized chemically, but the value of a natural nonsynthetic product is among the most valuable flavor compounds on the market. Coumaroyl-coenzyme A (CoA) is the direct precursor for raspberry ketone but also an essential precursor for flavonoid and lignin biosynthesis in plants and therefore highly regulated. The synthetic fusion of 4-coumaric acid ligase (4CL) and benzalacetone synthase (BAS) enables the channeling of coumaroyl-CoA from the ligase to the synthase, proving to be a powerful tool in the production of raspberry ketone in both ",

    "abstract": "(1) Background: Bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) has gained in popularity over the years due to its outstanding properties such as renewability, biocompatibility, and bioavailability, and its use as an eco-friendly material of the future for replacing petrochemical products. (2) Methods: This research refers to the utilization of lignocellulose coming from wood waste via enzymatic hydrolysis to produce biopolymer BNC with an accumulation rate of 0.09 mg/mL/day. Besides its significant contribution to the sustainability, circularity, and valorization of biomass products, the obtained BNC was functionalized through the adsorption of black raspberry extract (BR) by simple soaking. (3) Results: BR contained 77.25 \u00b1 0.23 mg GAE/g of total phenolics and 27.42 \u00b1 0.32 mg CGE/g of total anthocyanins. The antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of BR was evaluated by DPPH (60.51 \u00b1 0.18 \u00b5g/mL) and FRAP (1.66 \u00b1 0.03 mmol Fe",

    "abstract": "With global climate warming, recurring extreme heat and high temperatures irreversibly damage plants. Raspberries, known for their nutritional and medicinal value, are in high demand worldwide. Thus, it is important to study how high-temperature stress (HTS) affects raspberries. The physiological and biochemical responses and molecular genetic mechanisms of raspberry leaves to different HTS treatments were investigated: mild high temperature at 35\u00b0C (HT35), severe high temperature at 40\u00b0C (HT40), and the control at room temperature of 25\u00b0C (CK). The physiological results suggested that leaves in both the 35\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C treatments showed maximum relative conductivity at 4\u00a0d of stress, increasing by 28.54% and 43.36%, respectively, compared to CK. Throughout the stress period (0-4 d), malondialdehyde (MDA) and soluble protein contents of raspberry leaves increased under HT35 and HT40 treatments, while soluble sugar content first decreased and then increased. Catalase (CAT) activity increased, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity first increased and then decreased, and peroxidase (POD) activity gradually decreased. Photosynthetic and fluorescence responses of raspberry leaves showed the most severe impairment after 4\u00a0d of stress. Transcriptomics results revealed significant alterations in 42 HSP family genes, two SOD-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 25 POD-related DEGs, three CAT-related DEGs, and 38 photosynthesis-related DEGs under HTS. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that these DEGs were mainly enriched in photosynthesis-antenna proteins, pentose and glucuronide interconversion, phenylpropane biosynthesis, and indole alkaloid biosynthesis. HTS induced excessive ROS accumulation in raspberry leaves, causing oxidative damage in plant cells and subsequently reducing photosynthesis in raspberry leaves. This reduction in photosynthesis, in turn, affects photosynthetic carbon fixation and starch and sucrose metabolism, which, combined with phenol propane biosynthesis, mitigates the HTS-induced damage.",

    "abstract": "Despite many efforts devoted toward the design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) at the framework level by selecting the building blocks, their organization in the nano to meso regimes is often neglected. Moreover, the importance of processability for their applications has recently emerged and the synthesis of COF nanostructures without agglomeration is still a challenge. Herein, the first example of hybrid COF-polymer particles for which polymers are used to manipulate the 2D COF growth along a specific direction is reported. The study examines how the nature, chain-end functionality, and molar mass of the polymer influence the shaping of hybrid 2D boronate ester-linked COF-polymer particles. Catechol-poly(N-butyl acrylate) leads to the self-assembly of crystallites into quasi-spherical structures while catechol-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) mediates the synthesis of raspberry-like COF-polymer particles with radial grain orientation. Scanning and transmission electron microscopies (SEM and TEM) and 4D-STEM-ACOM (automated crystal orientation mapping) highlight the single-crystal character of these domains with one plane family throughout the particles. Interestingly, the presence of PNIPAm on the particle surface allows their drying without co-crystallization and enables their resuspension. Kinetic investigations show that catechol-PnBuA acts as a modulator and catechol-PNIPAm induces a template effect, introducing supramolecular self-assembly properties into particles to create new morphologies with higher structural complexity, beyond the framework level.",

    "abstract": "The current study aimed to investigate the effect of orally administered raspberry ketone (RK) on ameliorating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced in rats by high-fat high-fructose diet (HFFD) in comparison to calorie restriction (CR) regimen. Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into two experimental groups; one was fed normal chow diet (NCD, n\u00a0=\u00a06) for 15 weeks to serve as normal control group and the other group was fed HFFD (n\u00a0=\u00a024) for 7 weeks to induce NAFLD. After induction, rats in the HFFD group were randomly allocated into four groups (n\u00a0=\u00a06 rats each). One group continued on HFFD feeding for 8 weeks (NAFLD control group). The remaining 3 groups received NCD, calorie-restricted diet, or NCD along with RK (55\u00a0mg/kg/day, orally) for 8 weeks. Like CR, RK effectively attenuated NAFLD and ameliorated the changes attained by HFFD. RK upregulated the expression of the phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (P-AMPK) and fatty acid oxidation factors; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-\u03b1) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) and downregulated lipogenic factors; sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) in the hepatic tissue. Also, RK improved lipid profile parameters, liver enzymes and both body and liver tissue weights. Altogether, these findings suggest that oral administration of RK, along with normal diet, ameliorated NAFLD in a way similar to CR. This approach could be an alternative to CR in the management of NAFLD, overcoming the poor compliance to long term CR regimen.",

    "abstract": "Male climacteric syndrome (MCS) is a medical condition that can affect middle-aged men whose testosterone levels begin to decline considerably. These symptoms may include fatigue, decreased libido, mood swings, and disturbed sleep. MCS can be managed with lifestyle modifications and testosterone replacement. However, testosterone therapy may cause number of side effects, including an increased risk of cardiovascular issues. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of unripe black raspberry extract (BRE) against MCS and voiding dysfunction in men with andropause symptoms. A total of 30 subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to the BRE group (n = 15) or the placebo group (n = 15). Participants were supplemented with 4800 mg BRE or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. The impact of BRE was assessed using the Aging Male's Symptoms (AMS scale), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the IPSS quality of life index (IPSS-QoL). Additionally, male sex hormones, lipid profiles, and anthropometric indices were assessed 6 and 12 weeks after treatment. The AMS scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. In the BRE group, the total IPSS and IPSS-QoL scores decreased significantly after 12 weeks compared to baseline (",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are neurological disorders that become more prevalent with age, usually caused by damage or loss of neurons or their myelin sheaths, such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important triggers for neurodegenerative disease development, and mitigation of oxidative stress caused by ROS imbalance in the human body is important for the treatment of these diseases. As a widespread delicious fruit, the raspberry is widely used in the field of food and medicine because of its abundant polyphenols and other bioactive substances. Polyphenols from a wide variety of raspberry sources could alleviate neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to summarize the current roles of these polyphenols in maintaining neurological stability by regulating the composition and metabolism of the intestinal flora and the gut-brain axis signal transmission. Especially, we discuss the therapeutic effects on neurodegenerative diseases of raspberry polyphenols through intestinal microorganisms and ROS signals, by means of summary and analysis. Finally, methods of improving the digestibility and utilization of raspberry polyphenols are proposed, which will provide a potential way for raspberry polyphenols to guarantee the health of the human nervous system.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic control of polyphenol accumulation in red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L).\nThe levels of total anthocyanins and 37 individual polyphenol metabolites were measured over three years in a raspberry biparental mapping population. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for these traits were mapped onto a high-density SNP linkage map.\nAt least one QTL was detected for each trait, with good consistency among the years. On four linkage groups (LG), there were major QTLs affecting several metabolites. On LG1, a QTL had large effects on anthocyanins and flavonols containing a rutinoside or rhamnose group. On LG4, a QTL had large effects on several flavonols and on LG5 and LG6 QTLs had large effects on ellagic acid derivatives. Smaller QTLs were found on LG2 and LG3.\nThe identification of robust QTLs for key polyphenols in raspberry provides great potential for marker-assisted breeding for improved levels of potentially health beneficial components.",

    "abstract": "The economical production of small fruits has been significantly complicated by the spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii Matsumura, throughout its invaded rage. Fall-bearing red raspberries are especially susceptible to D. suzukii, and significant efforts to mitigate their damage are undertaken by growers. Exclusion barriers made from fine-mesh netting has emerged as an organic compliant strategy to mitigate damage from D. suzukii. Identifying less susceptible raspberry cultivars may also alleviate D. suzukii damage. Key pollination complications arise from exclusion-based tactics, but properly timing exclusion establishment may provide a remedy. In a 2-yr-old fall-bearing raspberry planting containing 3 cultivars, exclusion barriers were erected at 2 phenological timings. Spinosad- and pyrethrin-based pesticides were also applied to separate rows throughout harvest and a fourth treatment group matured without management. A subsection of raspberries was harvested and examined for marketability or damage, and D. suzukii adult populations were sampled with baited traps. An exclusion barrier applied early in fruit development was the most effective pest management strategy of those we tested. Its use decreased D. suzukii captures by 75%, decreased D. suzukii-infested fruit weights by 48%, and increased marketable yield by 63% compared to the no management control; however, it also increased pollination deficient fruit weights. Exclusion netting applied later in fruit maturation also decreased D. suzukii captures, infested fruit weights, and the weight of fruits damaged by other arthropod pests but did not significantly increase marketable yield. Our results indicate that netting exclusions may hold promise for the economical production of fall-bearing raspberries.",

    "abstract": "In Europe, the green course is becoming increasingly relevant, and there are more and more suggestions for its improvement. The valorization of food waste attracts increasing attention and is one important current research area. The aim of this study was to examine oils from 16 raspberry variety seeds and to compare their yields and fatty acid contents. The next task was to extract oil from the raspberry variety 'Polka' by four different methods and to compare the yield, colors, fatty acids content and composition, and kinematic and dynamic viscosity. The last task was to analyze the economic profitability of oil extraction by different methods. This study demonstrates the potential of different varieties of raspberry by-products and shows the influence of different oil extraction methods on the fatty acid composition of the oil and the economic potential of such products. The analysis revealed that the predominating fatty acid in the raspberry variety 'Polka' seed oil was linoleic acid (44.0-44.8%), followed by \u03b1-linolenic acid (37.9-38.1%) and oleic acid (10.2-10.6%). Of the 16 raspberry cultivars tested, 'Polka' seed oil had the least linoleic (\u03c9-6) (44.79%) and the most \u03b1-linolenic (\u03c9-3) fatty acids and the best ratio of \u03c9-6 to \u03c9-3 fatty acids-1.2:1. Raspberry variety 'Polka' seed oil contains a lot of carotenoids; their total amount depending on the extraction method varies from 0.81 mg/100 g (extracted with subcritical CO",

    "abstract": "Measuring lycopene in tomatoes is fundamental to the agrifood industry because of its health benefits. It is one of the leading quality criteria for consuming this fruit. Traditionally, the amount determination of this carotenoid is performed using the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. This is a very reliable and accurate method, but it has several disadvantages, such as long analysis time, high cost, and destruction of the sample. In this sense, this work proposes a low-cost sensor that correlates the lycopene content in tomato with the color present in its epicarp. A Raspberry Pi 4 programmed with Python language was used to develop the lycopene prediction model. Various regression models were evaluated using neural networks, fuzzy logic, and linear regression. The best model was the fuzzy nonlinear regression as the RGB input, with a correlation of R",

    "abstract": "Previous studies suggested that dietary supplementation with prebiotic fructooligosaccharides (FOSs) and polyphenols could mitigate disorders related to the first stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced by an obesogenic diet. Therefore, this experiment aimed to address whether the health-promoting potential of raspberry polyphenols together with FOSs can regulate advanced-stage NAFLD in Zucker rats genetically predisposed to develop obesity. The addition of FOSs and raspberry polyphenolic extract to the diet reduced liver fat accumulation and triglyceride, free fatty acid, and total cholesterol levels in the liver. The elevated GSH/GSSG ratio and reduced malondialdehyde content indicated that the liver antioxidant potential was considerably increased. The treatment also lowered the plasma aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities and collagen type IV levels. Insulin levels were decreased, but glucose levels remained constant, indicating greater insulin sensitivity. These changes may result from the upregulation of FXR and AHR receptors in the liver, which are responsible for regulating lipid metabolism and glucose and bile acid synthesis. The reduced bile acid levels in the cecal contents confirmed the activation of liver mechanisms. In conclusion, dietary enrichment with FOSs and raspberry polyphenolic extract has sufficient health-promoting potential to regulate liver metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation related to NAFLD development in obese Zucker rats.",

    "abstract": "Sorbets are a popular dessert, especially during hot summer days. They can also have health-promoting qualities, mainly due to the nutritional value of the fruit from which they are made. The production technology can also have an impact on the final nutritional quality of the sorbets. This paper presents a comparative assessment of the quality of industrial fruit sorbets and their craft analogs. Sorbets with the following flavors were selected for the research: blueberry, strawberry, raspberry, and passion fruit with mango. An organoleptic evaluation was performed, and the overrun, melting resistance, active acidity (pH), color in the CIE Lab system, antiradical activity (DDPH method), and content of vitamin C and total polyphenols were determined. The research revealed the differences between sorbets produced from different fruits as well as the differences depending on the production method between products made of the same type of fruit. Craft sorbets were found to be better than industrial sorbets, and storage time had a significant effect on the sorbets' quality. In terms of organoleptic characteristics, craft mango-passion fruit sorbet turned out to be the best; in terms of antioxidant properties, craft raspberry and strawberry sorbets were the best, and these two sorbets also showed good, stable overrun and melting resistance values during storage.",

    "abstract": "Queensland fruit fly (Qfly) males exhibit accelerated sexual maturation when their diet is supplemented with raspberry ketone (RK) for 48\u2009h following emergence, which is beneficial for sterile insect technique operation. The present study tests whether RK supplementation makes Qfly more vulnerable to starvation or desiccation.\nFlies were fed for 48\u2009h with a yeast hydrolysate and sugar diet (1:3) that contained 0% RK (control), 1.25% RK (low dose) or 5% RK (high dose) to test subsequent vulnerability to starvation and desiccation. RK feeding decreased body weight and water content in males and increased lipid levels in both sexes before exposure to any stress treatment. Under nutritional stress, flies fed the low RK dose, but not the high RK dose, had higher survival than controls. Under desiccation stress, flies fed both the low and high RK doses had lower survival than the controls. Body weight, water content and lipid reserves at death were all affected by RK dose when under nutritional stress, but not when under desiccation stress. In the absence of stress, body weight at death was higher than controls in flies provided with the high RK dose and lipids were lower than controls in flies provided with the low RK dose.\nFeeding with RK makes Qflies more vulnerable to desiccation but not starvation. In most conditions, it is expected that the disadvantage of increased desiccation vulnerability would be outweighed by the benefits of accelerated sexual maturation in RK-fed young adult Qflies. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Repairing potholes is a task for municipalities to prevent serious road user injuries and vehicle damage. This study presents a low-cost, high-performance pothole monitoring system to maintain urban roads. The authors developed a methodology based on photogrammetry techniques to predict the pothole's shape and volume. A collection of overlapping 2D images shot by a Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B has been used to create a pothole 3D model. The Raspberry-based configuration has been mounted on an autonomous and remote-controlled robot (developed in the InfraROB European project) to reduce workers' exposure to live traffic in survey activities and automate the process. The outputs of photogrammetry processing software have been validated through laboratory tests set as ground truth; the trial has been conducted on a tile made of asphalt mixture, reproducing a real pothole. Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) technologies allowed visualising potholes on a map with information about their centre, volume, backfill material, and an associated image. Ten on-site tests validated that the system works in an uncontrolled environment and not only in the laboratory. The results showed that the system is a valuable tool for monitoring road potholes taking into account construction workers' and road users' health and safety.",

    "abstract": "Belonging to Rosaceae, red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) and wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca) are closely related species with distinct fruit types. While the numerous ovaries become the juicy drupelet fruits in raspberry, their strawberry counterparts become dry and tasteless achenes. In contrast, while the strawberry receptacle, the stem tip, enlarges to become a red fruit, the raspberry receptacle shrinks and dries. The distinct fruit-forming ability of homologous organs in these 2 species allows us to investigate fruit type determination. We assembled and annotated the genome of red raspberry (R. idaeus) and characterized its fruit development morphologically and physiologically. Subsequently, transcriptomes of dissected and staged raspberry fruit tissues were compared to those of strawberry from a prior study. Class B MADS box gene expression was negatively associated with fruit-forming ability, which suggested a conserved inhibitory role of class B heterodimers, PISTILLATA/TM6 or PISTILLATA/APETALA3, for fruit formation. Additionally, the inability of strawberry ovaries to develop into fruit flesh was associated with highly expressed lignification genes and extensive lignification of the ovary pericarp. Finally, coexpressed gene clusters preferentially expressed in the dry strawberry achenes were enriched in \"cell wall biosynthesis\" and \"ABA signaling,\" while coexpressed clusters preferentially expressed in the fleshy raspberry drupelets were enriched in \"protein translation.\" Our work provides extensive genomic resources as well as several potential mechanisms underlying fruit type specification. These findings provide the framework for understanding the evolution of different fruit types, a defining feature of angiosperms.",

    "abstract": "Understanding soil bacterial diversity under nitrogen reduction is necessary for the crucial role in soil nitrogen cycling. However, the effects of combined fertilization on soil chemical properties, microbial community structure, and yield are unknown. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of nitrogen fertilizer reduction with bio-organic fertilizer on soil bacterial community diversity of red raspberry orchard. Six treatments were set in this study: NF-100%, NF-75%, NF-50%, NF-25% and CF, no nitrogen fertilizer and bio-organic fertilizer for CK. The bacterial community structures of soil were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplification high-throughput sequencing technology. Nitrogen fertilizer reduction with bio-organic fertilizer increased soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), and reduced soil pH. NF-50% and NF-25% treatments increased the yield of red raspberry. Nitrogen reduction combined with bio-organic fertilizer increased the relative abundance of copiotrophic bacteria and decreased the relative abundance of oligotrophic bacteria. The increase in copiotrophic bacteria in the soil of red raspberry orchard could indicate an increase in soil nutrient availability, which have positive implications for soil fertility and production. However, nitrogen fertilizer reduction with bio-organic fertilizer altered the abundance and diversity of soil bacteria, which was reduced compared to CF treatments. The PCoA analysis of the soil bacterial community showed that the community structure of NF-25% treatment was more different from other treatments, indicating that the fertilization method changed the community structure of soil bacteria. The results of a redundancy analysis showed that SOM, pH, AN, TN, and AP were the main factors affecting the microbial community structure. Overall, the reduction of nitrogen fertilizer with bio-organic fertilizer significantly increased the soil nutrient content, reduced the relative abundance and diversity of soil bacteria, increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria in the soil, changed the bacterial community structure of soil, increased production and created suitable soil conditions for the red raspberry growth.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberries, which contain a variety of nutrients and phytochemicals that are beneficial for human health, can be utilized as a raw material in the creation of several supplements. This research suggests micronized powder of raspberry pomace production. The molecular characteristics (FTIR), sugar, and biological potential (phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity) of micronized raspberry powders were investigated. FTIR spectroscopy results revealed spectral changes in the ranges with maxima at ~1720, 1635, and 1326, as well as intensity changes in practically the entire spectral range analyzed. The discrepancies clearly indicate that the micronization of the raspberry byproduct samples cleaved the intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the polysaccharides present in the samples, thus increasing the respective content of simple saccharides. In comparison to the control powders, more glucose and fructose were recovered from the micronized samples of the raspberry powders. The study's micronized powders were found to contain nine different types of phenolic compounds, including rutin, elagic acid derivatives, cyanidin-3-sophoroside, cyanidin-3-(2-glucosylrutinoside), cyanidin-3-rutinoside, pelargonidin-3-rutinoside, and elagic acid derivatives. Significantly higher concentrations of ellagic acid and ellagic acid derivatives and rutin were found in the micronized samples than in the control sample. The antioxidant potential assessed by ABTS and FRAP significantly increased following the micronization procedure.",

    "abstract": "We designed a portable Raspberry Pi-based spectrometer, which mainly consists of a white LED acting as the wide-spectrum source, a reflection grating for light dispersion, and a CMOS imaging chip aiming at spectral recording. All the optical elements and Raspberry Pi were integrated using 3-D printing structures with a size of 118 mm \u00d7 92 mm \u00d7 84 mm, and home-built software was also designed for spectral recording, calibration, analysis, and display implemented with a touch LCD. Additionally, the portable Raspberry Pi-based spectrometer was equipped with an internal battery, thus supporting on-site applications. Tested by a series of verifications and applications, the portable Raspberry Pi-based spectrometer could reach a spectral resolution of 0.065 nm per pixel within the visible band and provide spectral detection with high accuracy. Therefore, it can be used for on-site spectral testing in various fields.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the anti-melanogenic activity of raspberry ketone glucoside (RKG) and further explore the specific molecular mechanisms by which RKG affects melanogenesis.\nThe B16F10 cells model, the mushroom tyrosinase model and the zebrafish model were used to assess the whitening activity of RKG. We subsequently identified possible pathways related to RKG inhibition of melanogenesis by RNA-seq analysis and qRT-PCR on the zebrafish model, and further explored the effects of key genes on the pathway on the melanogenic effect of RKG by using related pathway inhibitors and Tg [mpeg: EGFP] transgenic zebrafish line.\nRKG could noticeably inhibit melanogenesis in B16F10 cells in vitro and on zebrafish in vivo. The RNA-Seq analysis and the qRT-PCR in zebrafish embryos indicated that the inhibition of melanogenesis by RKG could be achieved by activating JAK1/STAT3 signal pathway and inhibiting the expression levels of the MITFa, TYR, TYRP1a genes directly associated with melanogenesis. The inhibitor tests revealed that the inhibitory effect of the RKG on melanogenesis was restored by the IL6, JAK1/2, and STAT3 inhibitors, specifically STAT3 inhibitor. We further examine the relationship between the JAK1/STAT3 signal pathway and the MITFa. The achieved results indicate that the RKG could activate the zebrafish macrophages via the JAK1, but the inhibition of macrophage activation by loganin did not affect the anti-pigmentation effect of the RKG.\nRKG showed remarkable whitening activity on both B16F10 cells in vitro and zebrafish model in vivo. Furthermore, RKG could inhibit melanogenesis by activating the IL6/JAK1/STAT3 pathway, inhibiting the transcriptional activity of MITFa, and its downstream expression levels of the TYR and TYRP1a genes.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is an economically valuable soft-fruit species with a relatively small (~300 Mb) but highly heterozygous diploid (2n = 2x = 14) genome. Chromosome-scale genome sequences are a vital tool in unravelling the genetic complexity controlling traits of interest in crop plants such as red raspberry, as well as for functional genomics, evolutionary studies, and pan-genomics diversity studies. In this study, we developed genome sequences of a primocane fruiting variety ('Autumn Bliss') and a floricane variety ('Malling Jewel'). The use of long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing data yielded long read lengths that permitted well resolved genome sequences for the two cultivars to be assembled. The de novo assemblies of 'Malling Jewel' and 'Autumn Bliss' contained 79 and 136 contigs respectively, and 263.0 Mb of the 'Autumn Bliss' and 265.5 Mb of the 'Malling Jewel' assembly could be anchored unambiguously to a previously published red raspberry genome sequence of the cultivar 'Anitra'. Single copy ortholog analysis (BUSCO) revealed high levels of completeness in both genomes sequenced, with 97.4% of sequences identified in 'Autumn Bliss' and 97.7% in 'Malling Jewel'. The density of repetitive sequence contained in the 'Autumn Bliss' and 'Malling Jewel' assemblies was significantly higher than in the previously published assembly and centromeric and telomeric regions were identified in both assemblies. A total of 42,823 protein coding regions were identified in the 'Autumn Bliss' assembly, whilst 43,027 were identified in the 'Malling Jewel' assembly. These chromosome-scale genome sequences represent an excellent genomics resource for red raspberry, particularly around the highly repetitive centromeric and telomeric regions of the genome that are less complete in the previously published 'Anitra' genome sequence.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the therapeutic role of calorie-restricted diet (CR) and raspberry ketone (RK) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the implication of sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1)/sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling.\nNAFLD was induced by feeding rats high-fat-fructose-diet (HFFD) for 6 weeks. Rats were then randomly assigned to three groups (n = 6 each); NAFLD group continued on HFFD for another 8 weeks. CR group was switched to CR diet (25% calorie restriction) for 8 weeks and RK group was switched to normal diet and received RK (55 mg/kg/day; orally) for 8 weeks. Another six rats were used as normal control.\nHFFD induced a state of NAFLD indicated by increased fat deposition in liver tissue along with dyslipidemia, elevated liver enzymes, oxidative stress and inflammation. Either CR diet or RK reversed these changes and decreased HFFD-induced elevation of hepatic SphK1, S1P, S1PR1 and TLR4. Of notice, RK along with a normal calorie diet was even better than CR alone in most studied parameters.\nSphK1/S1P and TLR4 are interconnected and related to the establishment of HFFD-induced NAFLD and can be modulated by RK. Supplementation of RK without calorie restriction to patients with NAFLD unable to follow CR diet to achieve their treatment goals would be a promising therapeutic modality.",

    "abstract": "Gut dysbiosis is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with uremic toxin production, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular disease development. Therefore, healthy dietary patterns are essential modulators of gut microbiota. In this context, studies suggest that consuming berry fruits, rich in polyphenols and nutrients, may positively affect the gut microbiota, promoting the selective growth of beneficial bacteria and improving clinical status. However, studies on the effects of berry fruits on gut microbiota in CKD are scarce, and a better understanding of the possible mechanisms of action of berry fruits on gut microbiota is needed to guide future clinical studies and clinical practice in CKD. The objective was to discuss how berry fruits (blueberry, cranberry, raspberry, and strawberry) could be a therapeutic strategy to modulate the gut microbiota and possibly reverse the dysbiosis in CKD. Overall, available evidence shows that berry fruits can promote an increase in diversity by affecting the abundance of mucus-producing bacteria and short-chain fatty acids. Moreover, these fruits can increase the expression of mRNA involved in tight junctions in the gut such as occludin, tight junction protein 1 (TJP1), and mucin. Studies on the exact amount of berries leading to these effects show heterogeneous findings. However, it is known that, with 5\u2009mg/day, it is already possible to observe some effects in animal models. Wild berries could possibly improve the uremic condition by reducing the levels of uremic toxins via modulation of the gut microbiota. In the long term, this could be an excellent strategy for patients with CKD. Therefore, clinical studies are encouraged to evaluate better these effects on CKD as well as the safe amount of these fruits in order to promote a better quality of life or even the survival of these patients.",

    "abstract": "Raspberries (Rubus idaeus L.), occurring in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere and blackberries (R. fruticosus L.), cultivated and growing all over the world, are plant species of the family Rosaceae. These species are susceptible to phytoplasma infections, which cause Rubus stunt disease. It spreads uncontrolled by vegetative propagation of plants (Linck and Reineke 2019a) and by phloem-sucking insect vectors, especially Macropsis fuscula (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) (de Fluiter and van der Meer, 1953; Linck and Reineke 2019b). During a survey in commercial field in June 2021, over 200 raspberry bushes cv Enrosadira exhibiting typical symptoms of Rubus stunt were observed in Central Bohemia. Symptoms included dieback, leaf yellowing/reddening, stunted growth, severe phyllody and fruit malformations. Most diseased plants were growing in the edge rows of the field (about 80%). No symptomatic plants were observed in the middle of the field. Similar symptoms were observed in private gardens in South Bohemia on raspberry cv Rutrago and blackberry (unknown cultivar) in June 2018 and August 2022, respectively. DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) from flower stems and parts affected by phyllody of seven symptomatic plants as well as flower stems, leaf midribs, and petioles of five asymptomatic field plants. The DNA extracts were analyzed by a nested polymerase chain reaction assay using universal phytoplasma P1A/P7A primers followed by R16F2m/R1m and the group-specific R16(V)F1/R1 primers (Bertaccini et al. 2019). All samples from the symptomatic plants yielded an amplicon of expected size, while no product was amplified in asymptomatic plants. The P1A/P7A amplicons from three selected plants (two raspberries and one blackberry, each from different location) were cloned and bi-directionally Sanger sequenced (GenBank Accession Nos.OQ520100-2). The sequences spanned nearly full-length of 16S rRNA gene, 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer, tRNA-Ile gene, and a partial 23S rRNA gene. BLASTn search revealed the highest sequence identity (99.8-99.9%, query coverage 100%) to 'Candidatus Phytoplasma rubi' strain RS (GenBank Accession No. CP114006). To further characterize the 'Ca. P. rubi' strains, all these three samples were subjected to multigene sequence analysis. Sequences from a major portion of the tuf, rplV-rpsC, rpsH-rplR, uvrB-degV, and rplO-SecY-map genes (Acc. Nos. OQ506112-26) were obtained as described previously (Fr\u00e1nov\u00e1 et al. 2016). Comparison to GenBank sequences confirmed their highest identity (99.6-100%, query coverage 100%) with 'Ca. P. rubi' RS strain, regardless of their geographic location and host (raspberry or blackberry). Recently, Bertaccini et al. (2022) suggested the 98,65 % 'Ca. Phytoplasma' strain identity threshold within 16Sr RNA sequences. In this survey, all three strains sequenced shared \u226599.73% sequence identity of the analysed 16S rRNA gene sequences and the high identity in the other genes with the reference 'Ca. P. rubi' RS strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Rubus stunt disease in the Czech Republic as well as the first molecular identification and characterization of 'Ca. P. rubi' from raspberry and blackberry in our country. As Rubus stunt disease is of great economic importance (Linck and Reineke 2019a), the pathogen detection and prompt removal of the diseased shrubs are essential to mitigating the spread and impact of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Many studies show that the intake of raspberries is beneficial to immune-metabolic health, but the responses of individuals are heterogeneous and not fully understood.\nIn a two-arm parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial, immune-metabolic outcomes and plasma metabolite levels were analyzed before and after an 8-week red raspberry consumption. Based on partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) on plasma xenobiotic levels, adherence to the intervention was first evaluated. A second PLS-DA followed by hierarchical clustering was used to classify individuals into response subgroups. Clinical immune and metabolic outcomes, including insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and sensitivity (Matsuda, QUICKI) indices, during the intervention were assessed and compared between response subgroups.\nTwo subgroups of participants, type 1 responders (\nThe beneficial effects associated with red raspberry consumption are subject to inter-individual variability. Metabolomics-based clustering appears to be an effective way to assess adherence to a nutritional intervention and to classify individuals according to their immune-metabolic responsiveness to the intervention. This approach may be replicated in future studies to provide a better understanding of how interindividual variability impacts the effects of nutritional interventions on immune-metabolic health.",

    "abstract": "The application of direct-injection mass spectrometric (DI-MS) techniques, like Proton Transfer Reaction Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) has been suggested as a reliable phenotyping tool for fruit volatilome assessment in both genetic and quality-related studies. In this study the complexity of raspberry aroma was investigated by a comprehensive untargeted VOC analysis, done by combining SPME-GC-MS and PTR-ToF-MS assessments with multi-block discriminant analysis using the DIABLO mixOmics framework. The aim was to acquire an exhaustive characterization of the raspberry volatilome according to different fruit ripening stages (pink, ripe, and overripe) and genetic variances (50 accessions), as well as to investigate the potential of PTR-ToF-MS as a rapid and high throughput VOC phenotyping tool to address issues related to raspberry fruit quality. Results of this study demonstrated the complementarity between SPME-GC-MS and PTR-ToF-MS techniques to evaluate the raspberry aroma composition. PTR-ToF-MS generates reliable raspberry VOC fingerprints mainly due to a reduced compound fragmentation and precise content estimation. In addition, the high collinearity between isomers of monoterpenes and norisoprenoids, discovered by GC analysis, reduces the main analytic limitation of PTR-ToF-MS of not being able to separate isomeric molecules. The high similarity between the VOC matrices obtained by applying PTR-ToF-MS and SPME-GC-MS confirmed the possibility of using PTR-ToF-MS as a reliable high throughput phenotyping tool for raspberry volatiolome assessment. In addition, results provided by the germplasm collection investigation enabled to distinguish the best performing accessions, based on VOCs composition, to be used as superior parental lines for future breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "Polygalacturonase (PG) is an important hydrolytic enzyme involved in pectin disassembly and the subsequent textural changes during fruit ripening. Although the interaction of fungal PGs with other proteins has been documented, the interaction of plant PGs with other plant proteins has not yet been studied. In this study, the molecular mechanisms involved in raspberry fruit ripening, particularly the polygalacturonase (RiPG) interaction with polygalacturonase inhibiting protein (RiPGIP) and substrate, were investigated with a structural approach. The 3D model of RiPG2 and RiPGIP3 was built using a comparative modeling strategy and validated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The RiPG2 model structure comprises 11 complete coils of right-handed parallel \u03b2-helix architecture, with an average of 27 amino acid residues per turn. The structural model of the RiPGIP3 displays a typical structure of LRR protein, with the right-handed superhelical fold with an extended parallel \u03b2-sheet. The conformational interaction between the RiPG2 protein and RiPGIP3 showed that RiPGIP3 could bind to the enzyme and thereby leave the active site cleft accessible to the substrate. All this evidence indicates that RiPG2 enzyme could interact with RiPGIP3 protein. It can be a helpful model for evaluating protein-protein interaction as a potential regulator mechanism of hydrolase activity during pectin disassembly in fruit ripening.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) is an economically significant pathogen of raspberry and grapevine, and it has also been found in cherry. Most of the currently available RBDV sequences are from European raspberry isolates. This study aimed to sequence genomic RNA2 of both cultivated and wild raspberry in Kazakhstan and compare them to investigate their genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships, as well as to predict their protein structure. Phylogenetic and population diversity analyses were performed on all available RBDV RNA2, MP and CP sequences. Nine of the isolates investigated in this study formed a new, well-supported clade, while the wild isolates clustered with the European isolates. Predicted protein structure analysis revealed two regions that differed between \u03b1- and \u03b2-structures among the isolates. For the first time, the genetic composition of Kazakhstani raspberry viruses has been characterized.",

    "abstract": "RoboCupJunior is a project-oriented competition for primary and secondary school students that promotes robotics, computer science and programing. Through real life scenarios, students are encouraged to engage in robotics in order to help people. One of the popular categories is Rescue Line, in which an autonomous robot has to find and rescue victims. The victim is in the shape of a silver ball that reflects light and is electrically conductive. The robot should find the victim and place it in the evacuation zone. Teams mostly detect victims (balls) using random walk or distant sensors. In this preliminary study, we explored the possibility of using a camera, Hough transform (HT) and deep learning methods for finding and locating balls with the educational mobile robot Fischertechnik with Raspberry Pi (RPi). We trained, tested and validated the performance of different algorithms (convolutional neural networks for object detection and U-NET architecture for sematic segmentation) on a handmade dataset made of images of balls in different light conditions and surroundings. RESNET50 was the most accurate, and MOBILENET_V3_LARGE_320 was the fastest object detection method, while EFFICIENTNET-B0 proved to be the most accurate, and MOBILENET_V2 was the fastest semantic segmentation method on the RPi. HT was by far the fastest method, but produced significantly worse results. These methods were then implemented on a robot and tested in a simplified environment (one silver ball with white surroundings and different light conditions) where HT had the best ratio of speed and accuracy (4.71 s, DICE 0.7989, IoU 0.6651). The results show that microcomputers without GPUs are still too weak for complicated deep learning algorithms in real-time situations, although these algorithms show much higher accuracy in complicated environment situations.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogelled emulsions (HEs) of linseed oil and pea protein (PP) were produced with four levels (0, 5, 7.5, and 10%) of raspberry extract obtained by a green extraction technique (microwave hydrodiffusion and gravity-MHG). HEs were applied in burgers to replace 50% of pork backfat content. The products' technological, nutritional, oxidative, microbiological, and sensory properties were evaluated. Besides reducing the fat level by approximately 43%, the reformulation reduced the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio to healthy levels, decreased the diameter reduction by 30%, and increased the cooking yield by 11%. Including 7.5 and 10% of raspberry extract in the HEs decreased the oxidative defects caused by the enrichment of the burgers with omega-3 fatty acids. In addition, the raspberry extract did not cause alterations in the mesophilic aerobic count and the burgers' sensory profile.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry leaf products are recommended by health care providers to induce labor despite insufficient efficacy and safety data. Less is known about community pharmacists' knowledge and recommendations regarding raspberry leaf products.\nThe primary end point was to describe New York State community pharmacist recommendations regarding raspberry leaf for labor induction. Secondary end points evaluated pharmacists' assessment of the patient for additional information, citation of a supporting reference, provision of safety and efficacy information, recommendation of a patient-appropriate reference, and change in recommendation after learning about the obstetrician-gynecologist's recommendation.\nUsing a list of registered New York State pharmacies via a Freedom of Information Law request, a randomized representative sample of included pharmacy types (grocery store, drugstore chain, independent, and mass merchandising) was called using a mystery caller approach. Calls were conducted by one investigator throughout July 2022. Data collection included items specific to the primary and secondary outcomes. This study was approved by the associated institutional review board.\nNew York State community pharmacists from grocery store, drugstore chain, independent, and mass merchandising pharmacies were called using the mystery caller approach.\nThe primary endpoint was measured by the number of evidence-based recommendations made by pharmacists.\nThe study included 366 pharmacies. Despite insufficient efficacy and safety data, there were 308 recommendations to use raspberry leaf products (n\u00a0= 308 of 366, 84.1%). Most pharmacists attempted to collect additional patient information (n\u00a0= 278 of 366, 76.0%). Many pharmacists did not clearly convey safety (n\u00a0= 168 of 366, 45.9%) or efficacy (n\u00a0= 197 of 366, 53.8%) information. Of those who discussed safety or efficacy, many said raspberry leaf products were safe and effective (n\u00a0= 125 of 198, 63.1%; n\u00a0= 82 of 169, 48.5%). Pharmacists often referred or deferred the patient to another medical professional for more information (n\u00a0= 92 of 282, 32.6%).\nThere is an opportunity to improve pharmacists' knowledge on the use of raspberry leaf products for the induction of labor and in making evidence-based recommendations when limited or conflicting efficacy and safety data exist.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) is transmitted through seed in infected red raspberry plants after pollination with pollen grains from healthy red raspberry plants. Here, we show that RBDV is not transmitted through seeds in infected Nicotiana benthamiana (Nb) plants after pollination with virus-free Nb pollen grains. Chromogenic in situ hybridization revealed that the virus invades the shoot apical meristem and the ovule, including the embryo sac, of RBDV-infected Nb plants; however, in seeds that developed from infected embryo sacs after fertilization by virus-free sperm cells, RBDV was absent in the embryos and present in the endosperms. When we analyzed seed transmission of RBDV in Nb mutants with mutations in dicer-like enzyme 2 and 4 (NbDCL2&4) or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (NbRDR6), RBDV was not present in the offspring from seeds with embryos and endosperms that did not express NbDCL2&4 or NbRDR6. These results suggest that seed transmission of RBDV is prevented by evasion of infection by the embryo and that RNA silencing is not essential for preventing seed transmission of RBDV in Nb plants.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry Ketone (RK) and Resveratrol (RSV) are natural phenolic antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. However, its combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics potentials are not reported. The study aims to assess the combined effect of RK with RSV to protect rats from carbon-tetrachloride (CCl4) induced oxidative stress and NASH. The toxicant CCl4 was employed at a concentration of 1\u2009mL/kg as a 1:1 (v/v) mixture with olive oil twice weekly for 6 weeks to induce liver toxicity. Animal treatment was followed for 2 weeks. Silymarin was used as a standard control drug to compare the hepatoprotective effect of RK and RSV. Hepatic histology, oxidative stress, MMP, reduced glutathione (GSH), plasma levels of SGOT, SGPT, and lipid profile (total cholesterol and triglycerides) were measured. Anti-inflammation genes (IL-10), and fibrotic genes (TGF-\u03b2) were also examined in liver tissue. Oral administration of combined RK with RSV (50\u2009+\u200950\u2009mg/kg for 2 weeks) showed significantly more hepatoprotection by significantly decreasing elevated plasma markers and lipid profile than alone RK and RSV (100\u2009mg/kg daily for 2 weeks). It also significantly alleviated the hepatic lipid peroxidation, restoring the activities of GSH levels in the liver. RT-PCR and Immunoblotting studies confirmed that significantly upregulation of anti-inflammation genes and protein expression (MMP-9) ameliorated the disease. Pharmacokinetic studies confirmed more synergistic stability in simulated gastric-intestinal fluids (FaSSGF, FaSSIF) and rat liver microsomes (CYP-450, NADPH oxidation & glucuronidation. Moreover, coadministration of drugs augmented the relative bioavailability, V",

    "abstract": "Monitoring plant responses to stress is an ongoing challenge for crop breeders, growers, and agronomists. The measurement of below-ground stress is particularly challenging as plants do not always show visible signs of stress in the above-ground organs, particularly at early stages. Hyperspectral imaging is a technique that could be used to overcome this challenge if associations between plant spectral data and specific stresses can be determined. In this study, three genotypes of red raspberry plants grown under controlled conditions in a glasshouse were subjected to below-ground biotic stresses (root pathogen ",

    "abstract": "The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the influence of two carrier agents, Nopal and Aloe Vera mucilage on the physicochemical properties and stability of blackberry and raspberry powders obtained by spray drying. A pilot scale spray dryer with a feed flow of 20 L/h and an atomization speed of 28,000\u2005rpm was used. The inlet and outlet air temperatures were from 180 to 80 \u00b0C, respectively. Yield, moisture content, water activity, hygroscopicity index, solubility time, volumetric density, stability diagrams, micrographs, and particle temperature were evaluated. The highest yields for blackberry extract were 75% with a concentration of 2.5% (w/v) Nopal mucilage, while raspberry extract yielded 65% with a concentration of 5% (w/v) Nopal mucilage. The increase in the concentration of the carrier agent presented an increase in the values of humidity, water activity, volumetric density, and solubility when Nopal mucilage was used as a carrier agent in both blackberry and raspberry extracts. Furthermore, when Aloe Vera mucilage was used as a carrier agent, these same values decreased with increasing concentration. The storage conditions of the powders obtained should be stored at temperatures below 20\u00b0C and water activities below 0.4. In addition, the stability diagrams show the particle conditions that should not be exceeded during spray drying.",

    "abstract": "Objective This study was performed to clarify the prevalence of raspberry-type gastric foveolar-type tumors, along with the time-course changes in the size and clinical course. Methods The subjects were 10,663 consecutive patients who underwent a medical checkup between April 2016 and March 2022, including an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) examination and determination of Helicobacter pylori infection status (uninfected, positive, post-eradication). The presence of characteristic reddish polypoid lesions in the stomach was investigated, and a diagnosis of raspberry-type gastric foveolar-type tumor was made based on histological findings. Results Thirty-eight cases had gastric polyps with a raspberry-like appearance on endoscopy, with 29 lesions in 28 cases endoscopically and histologically diagnosed as a raspberry-type gastric foveolar-type tumor. All of the affected subjects were determined to be H. pylori-uninfected. The prevalence of this type of lesion in all subjects was 0.26%, while that in the 6,635 H. pylori-uninfected subjects was 0.42%. An older age and the presence of a fundic gland polyp were found to be significant risk factors associated with the occurrence of the tumor. The mean size was 3.8\u00b11.9 (range: 2-10) mm, and the location was in a fundic gland area in all affected subjects. Furthermore, examinations of previous EGD images revealed that two-thirds of the lesions had not changed in size, while follow-up EGD findings showed that lesions \u22645 mm in size had disappeared after a biopsy procedure. Conclusion The prevalence of raspberry-type gastric foveolar-type tumors was 0.42% in H. pylori-uninfected subjects. More than half of the lesions were too small to be removed by an endoscopic biopsy.",

    "abstract": "A systematic review and meta-analysis were designed to summarize studies conducted on the effects of raspberry and blackcurrant consumption on blood pressure (BP). Eligible studies were detected by searching numerous five online databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, until December 17, 2022. We pooled the mean difference and its 95% confidence interval (CI) by applying a random-effects model. Overall, the impact of raspberry and blackcurrant on BP was reported in ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (420 subjects). Pooled analysis of six clinical trials revealed that raspberry consumption has no significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (weighted mean differences [WMDs], -1.42; 95% CI, -3.27 to 0.87; p = 0.224) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (WMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -1.77 to 0.71; p = 0.401), in comparison with placebo. Moreover, pooled analysis of four clinical trials indicated that blackcurrant consumption did not reduce SBP (WMD, -1.46; 95% CI, -6.62 to 3.7; p = 0.579), and DBP (WMD, -2.09; 95% CI, -4.38 to 0.20; p = 0.07). Raspberry and blackcurrant consumption elicited no significant reductions in BP. More accurate RCTs are required to clarify the impact of raspberry and blackcurrant intake on BP.",

    "abstract": "Identifying genetic variations or treatments that confer greater resistance to drought is paramount to ensuring sustainable crop productivity. Accurate and reproducible measurement of drought stress symptoms can be achieved via automated, image-based phenotyping. Many phenotyping platforms are either cost-prohibitive, require specific technical expertise, or are simply more complex than necessary to effectively evaluate drought resistance. Certain mutations, allelic variations, or treatments result in plants that constitutively use less water. To accurately identify genetic differences or treatments that confer a drought phenotype, plants from all experimental groups must be subjected to equal levels of drought stress. This can be easily achieved by growing and imaging plants that are grown in the same pot. Here, we provide a detailed protocol to configure a Raspberry Pi computer and camera module to image seedlings of multiple genotypes growing in shared pots and to transfer images and metadata via the cloud for downstream analyses. Also detailed is a method to calculate percent soil water content of pots while being imaged to allow for comparison of stress symptoms with water availability. This protocol was recently used to uncouple differential water usage from drought resistance in a dwarf ",

    "abstract": "Currently, remote laboratories have gained relevance in engineering education as tools to support active learning, experimentation, and motivation of students. Nonetheless, the costs and issues regarding their implementation and deployment limit the access of the students and educators to their advantages and features such as technical and educational. In this line, this study describes a fully open-source remote laboratory in hardware and software for education in automatic control systems employing Raspberry Pi and Python language with an approximate cost of USD 461. Even, by changing some components, the cost can be reduced to USD 420 or less. To illustrate the functionalities of the laboratory, we proposed a low-cost tank control system with its respective instrumentation, signal conditioning, identification, and control, which are exposed in this document. However, other experiments can be easily scalable and adaptable to the remote laboratory. Concerning the interface of the laboratory, we designed a complete user-friendly web interface with real-time video for the users to perform the different activities in automatic control such as identification or controller implementation through the programming language Python. The instructions to build and replicate the hardware and software are indicated in the open repositories provided for the project as well as in this paper. Our intention with this project is to offer a complete low-cost and open-source remote laboratory that can be adapted and used for the students, educators, and stakeholders to learn, experiment, and teach in the field of automatic control systems.",

    "abstract": "The amount of berry polyphenols required to exert health-promoting effects seems to be difficult to achieve by fresh fruit ingestion, so polyphenol-rich extracts could be considered a dietary alternative. In the present study, laboratory rats were fed high-fat diets supplemented with 0.1 or 0.3% raspberry polyphenols from pomace, with the former dose reflecting the amount of polyphenols consumed with a glass of fresh raspberries. It was hypothesized that beneficial changes in blood and hepatic tissue related to lipid metabolism would accompany both treatments, but the health-promoting effect would be more noticeable with the higher dose of extract. This hypothesis was confirmed, and the high dose of raspberry polyphenols was better than the low dose extract in terms of decreased epididymal white adipose tissue weight, hepatic triglyceride content, PPAR\u03b3 and SREBP-1c expression in the liver, and plasma IL-6 concentration, as well as increased acetic acid concentration in the cecal digesta. These effects might be partially associated with the enhanced content of ellagitannin and anthocyanin metabolites found in the blood plasma of rats administered the high dose of the extract. The results showed that this extract could be considered a dietary vehicle to provide an amount of raspberry polyphenols that could promote health.",

    "abstract": "After cold-pressing, small particles of seed residue remain in raspberry seed oil (RSO), even after passing it through cold filtration. The removal of the remaining seed residue is rather an alternative option to improve the visual properties of RSO. This study investigated the influence that the seeds\u2019 age (0, 10, 20 months) and clarification process after pressing has on the oxidative stability and phase transition of RSO by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results proved that the oil centrifugation process reduces the DPPH radical scavenging activity and oxidative stability measured by p-anisidine value (p-AnV) and DSC oxidation induction time (OIT) at 120 \u00b0C of all RSO samples, regardless of the age of the seeds (p \u2264 0.05). No significant differences were observed on the DSC melting and crystallization properties at 1 \u00b0C/min after the oil clarification by centrifugation (p > 0.05). The storage time of raspberry seeds, i.e., 10 and 20 months after expiry date, influenced the quality deterioration of RSO, as measured by higher p-AnV, lower DPPH, and OIT values (p \u2264 0.05). The results presented provide new information about oil production processing, suggesting that producers should reconsider giving up the clarification process of oil, since it lowers all quality parameters.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of ES on the cell structure and function of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus and then compare the effects of ES and heat treatment (HT) on microbial inactivation and flavour composition in honey raspberry wine. First, we found that the inactivation effect of ES treatment on the three microorganisms was significantly influenced by the voltage intensity. The degree of damage to the cellular structures and functions of the three microorganisms increased with increasing voltage. Second, the environment in which the microorganisms were present significantly influenced the ES pasteurisation effect. Pasteurisation by ES was better when the three microorganisms were in honey raspberry wine than in saline. Finally, the total number of colonies in honey raspberry wine was reduced from 4.50 to 2.03 log colony forming units/mL after ES treatment, and the wine had good stability during storage (84\u00a0days at 4\u00a0\u00b0C). In the honey raspberry wine, the contents of the main flavour substances (ketones and esters) did not change significantly after ES treatment, but HT decreased the content of esters and ketones by 13.5\u00a0% and 75.4\u00a0%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is an economically important fruit crop in Canada and about 80% of red raspberries are cultivated in British Columbia. In 2018, foliar symptoms associated with root rot and wilting complex disease were observed in raspberry field of Fraser Valley areas of British Columbia. Plants were stunted with reduced numbers of primocanes. Chlorosis and necrosis on leaves and partial wilting of branches were observed. When plants were uprooted, necrosis and browning on roots were observed. Two isolates of oomycetes pathogen were isolated using baiting with rhododendron leaves and pear fruit as described in Sapkota et al. 2022. Using FastDNA Spin kit (MP Biomedical, Burlingame, CA), genomic DNA of pathogen isolates was extracted from mycelia cultured on 20% clarified V8 agar medium amended with 10 mg pimaricin, 250 mg ampicillin, 10 mg rifampicin (V8PAR) per liter following the manufacturer's standard protocol. Pathogens were identified using colony morphology on 20% clarified V8 PAR as well as internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing with ITS1 primers (White et al. 1990) and multiplex targeted-sequencing with degenerate primers of three nuclear genes: heat shock protein90 (HSP90), elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1\u03b1) and beta tubulin (\u03b2tub). BLAST searches of ITS sequences of isolates of this study (accession nos. OP180065, OP180066) in NCBI GenBank showed 98.5 to 99.6% identity with the ITS sequence of P. gonapodyides (accession nos. MN513238.1, MG753496.1). Multiplex targeted sequencing also identified both isolates as a P. gonapodyides (accession nos. SRR20227809, SRR20227807) when mapped with the reference sequences (accession nos. HSP90: KX251233.1, EF1\u03b1: KX251231.1, \u03b2-tub: KX639710.1). Pathogenicity was confirmed by inoculating mycelial suspension of one isolate of P. gonapodyides on root of intact plants and mycelial plugs of two isolates on detached stems of the raspberry plants, 'Chemainus' in the greenhouse using methods described in Sapkota et al. 2022. Two experiments were conducted with three replicates in each test. Experiments were arranged using completely randomized design. In detached stem assays, distinct dark-lesion symptom appeared at 7 to 9 days after inoculation while uninoculated control stems remained asymptomatic. Intact plants showed wilting and foliar symptoms 15 days after inoculation and progressed higher at 4 to 5 weeks after inoculation. Root infection with dark brown to black color was observed when roots were assessed at 5 weeks after inoculation. The diseased root and crown tissues tested positive for Phytophthora in Agdia ImmunoStrip and P. gonapodyides was re-isolated and confirmed with multiplex-targeted sequencing. Phytophthora gonapodyides was previously reported from raspberry in Chile (Wilcox and Latorre 2002). To our best knowledge, this is the first report of P. gonapodyides infecting red raspberry in British Columbia, Canada. The detection of new Phytophthora species on raspberry may become a new potential problem to growers in addition to P. rubi, which is already a major cause of raspberry decline in the region.",

    "abstract": "Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is still a global health concern. Long-term alcohol intake alters the gut microbiota diversity and metabolic activity, and causes intestinal barrier dysfunction, leading to the development of ALD. This research explored the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of red raspberry (RR) on alcohol-related disorders in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a standard diet or a standard diet supplemented with 2%, 4%, and 8% weight/weight RR. Meanwhile, mice were administered 35% (v/v) ethanol (EtOH, 10 mL per kg body weight) intragastrically once daily for six weeks, except the control group mice. The results showed that RR supplementation decreased liver injury markers (alanine and aspartate transaminases) in the serum, reduced triglyceride level in the liver and downregulated hepatic cytochrome P450 2E1 mRNA expression in mice administered EtOH. In addition, EtOH-mediated oxidative stress in the liver was attenuated by RR supplementation through decreased hepatic malondialdehyde content and increased antioxidant (glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase) levels and activities in mice exposed to EtOH. Moreover, RR supplementation reversed EtOH-induced alteration in the cecal microbial composition at the phylum, order, genus, and species levels and improved the intestinal barrier function associated with the inhibition of the NF-\u03baB/MLCK pathway, which was accompanied by upregulation of tight junctions (zonula occludens 1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-4) and E-cadherin mRNA and protein expressions. Accordingly, RR supplementation resulted in a decreased level of endotoxins in the serum and attenuation of the inflammatory response in the liver, illustrated by a significant decrease in tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6 levels. Overall, RR supplementation alleviated the adverse effects of chronic alcohol intake in C57BL/6J mice and could be a potential supplement for improving ALD.",

    "abstract": "Advances in biomedical and engineering fields have greatly increased the need for understanding of soft structures. Soft materials such as gelatin and gelatin-based hydrogels have grown in popularity for use in a wide variety of applications including tissue engineering, biofabrication, and organ transplantation. With hydrogel structures being used in such demanding applications, it is crucial to properly characterize the dynamic behavior of these soft structures. Although there have been major improvements in measurement technology for determining the mechanical properties of soft, translucent materials, it remains quite challenging to reliably measure the Young's and shear moduli of these materials in a way that remains straightforward, low-cost, and non-contact. This research aims to address the weaknesses in modern measurement methods and develop a system suitable for characterizing the elastic moduli of soft materials that requires only four, inexpensive, off-the-shelf components. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi, stepping motor, and an inexpensive camera, the Young's and shear moduli of a gelatin column is measured five times. The standard deviation between measurement was observed to be less than 0.15% with high accuracy having an error of less than 4.6% when compared to relatively expensive, conventional measurement techniques.",

    "abstract": "The present study was conducted to determine the effects of spray-dried raspberry powder (SDRP) (CONTROL, 1.0%, 2.0%, and 3.0%) as a natural antioxidant, antimicrobial, and colorant on physicochemical properties, lipid oxidation, discoloration, and microbial quality of vacuum-packed (VP) ground beef during chilled storage at 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00b0C for 18\u00a0days. By incorporating SDRP into VP ground beef pH, lipid oxidation (TBARS), lightness, and hue angle (h\u00b0) values decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01), while redness (a*) and chroma (C*) values improved (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). SDRP treatments had higher redness, more stable color, and lower pH and TBARS values during storage in a dose-dependent manner (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), demonstrating that SDRP had a preventive effect on lipid oxidation and discoloration. The combination of vacuum packaging with SDRP generally resulted in lower bacterial growth during storage. These results demonstrated that 2% or 3% SDRP treatment has promising potential as an effective strategy to achieve oxidative and microbial stability and overcome discoloration in VP fresh meats.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK; [4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone]) is a synthetic flavoring agent and dietary supplement for weight control. This study investigated the metabolic signature of oral doses of RK that prevent weight gain or promote loss of righting reflex (LORR) in C57Bl/6J mice. Daily RK 200\u00a0mg/kg prevented high-fat diet (HFD; 45% Kcal fat) fed weight gain (\u223c8% reduction) over 35 days. RNA-seq of inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT) performed in males revealed 12 differentially expressed genes. Apelin (Apln) and potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily C member (Kcnc3) expression were elevated with HFD and normalized with RK dosing, which was confirmed by qPCR. Acute RK 640\u00a0mg/kg produced a LORR with a <5\u00a0min onset with a >30\u00a0min duration. Acute RK 200\u00a0mg/kg increased gene expression of Apln, Kcnc3, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), but reduced acetyl-COA carboxylase (Acc1) and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (Nqo1) in inguinal WAT. Acute RK 640\u00a0mg/kg elevated interleukin 6 (Il 6) and heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1) expression, but reduced Nrf2 in inguinal and epididymal WAT. Our findings suggest that RK has a dose-dependent metabolic signature in WAT associated with either weight control or LORR.",

    "abstract": "Polyphenols, ubiquitous in plant-originated foods, exhibit multifarious health benefits but are notorious for their low bioavailability. As the majority of polyphenols enter the colon where they are metabolized into the more bioavailable metabolites with multifarious bioactivities, gut microbiota composition is critical for realizing the health benefits of polyphenols. Black raspberries (BRB) are highly abundant in health-promoting but poorly absorbable polyphenols, primarily ellagitannins and anthocyanins. This study aimed to dissect the bilateral interactions between polyphenols and gut microbiotas of diverse origins. Using an optimized extraction procedure, BRB polyphenols were first comprehensively characterized by UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. Next, in vitro anaerobic fermentations with microbiota from human adults, infants, rats, and mice were conducted for comparison of phenolic profile (by metabolomics) and microbiota composition (by 16S rDNA sequencing) before and after fermentation. Bioinformatics analysis further revealed unique polyphenol-microbiota interactions and identified several bacterial species that could potentially produce bioactive and bioavailable phenolic metabolites following BRB consumption.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal acetylation modification is a common epigenetic change in tumorigenesis and is closely related to the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Our previous studies have suggested that black raspberry (BRB) anthocyanins have a significant chemopreventive effect against CRC. This study investigated whether protein acetylation plays an important role in BRB anthocyanins-mediated regulation of CRC progression.\nWe used the AOM-induced CRC mouse model and the CRC cell lines SW480 and Caco-2 to explore the potential role of acetylation of histone H4 and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway-related proteins (non-histone proteins) in the antitumor process mediated by BRB anthocyanins. The expression of related proteins was detected by western blot. ROS level was detected by immunofluorescence.\nBRB anthocyanins affected the acetylation level by down-regulating the expression of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and up-regulating the expression of MOF and EP300. The acetylation level of lysine sites on histone H4 (H4K5, H4K12 and H4K16) was increased. Furthermore, following BRB anthocyanins treatment, the expression of ac-p65 was significantly up-regulated and the NF-\u03baB signal pathway was activated, which in turn up-regulated Bax expression and inhibited Bcl-2, cyclin-D1, c-myc and NLRP3 expression to promote CRC cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and relieve inflammation.\nThe findings suggested that protein acetylation could play a critical role in BRB anthocyanins-regulated CRC development.",

In total, 22 strains were isolated: 16 from symptomatic raspberry shoots, 2 from asymptomatic raspberry leaves, and 4 from symptomatic blackberry shoots. Additionally, eight raspberry strains, isolated earlier from two similar outbreaks, were included in the study. Pathogenicity of the strains was confirmed on detached raspberry and blackberry shoots by reproducing the symptoms of natural infection. The strains were Gram-negative, fluorescent on King's medium B, ice nucleation positive, and utilized glucose oxidatively. All strains were levan positive, oxidase negative, nonpectolytic, arginine dihydrolase negative, and induced hypersensitivity in tobacco leaves (LOPAT + - - - +, ",
