    "abstract": "We present MMORF-FSL's MultiMOdal Registration Framework-a newly released nonlinear image registration tool designed primarily for application to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of the brain. MMORF is capable of simultaneously optimising both displacement and rotational transformations within a single registration framework by leveraging rich information from multiple scalar and tensor modalities. The regularisation employed in MMORF promotes local rigidity in the deformation, and we have previously demonstrated how this effectively controls both shape and size distortion, leading to more biologically plausible warps. The performance of MMORF is benchmarked against three established nonlinear registration methods-FNIRT, ANTs, and DR-TAMAS-across four domains: FreeSurfer label overlap, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) similarity, task-fMRI cluster mass, and distortion. The evaluation is based on 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset registered to the Oxford-MultiModal-1 (OMM-1) multimodal template via either the T1w contrast alone or in combination with a DTI/DTI-derived contrast. Results show that MMORF is the most consistently high-performing method across all domains-both in terms of accuracy and levels of distortion. MMORF is available as part of FSL, and its inputs and outputs are fully compatible with existing workflows. We believe that MMORF will be a valuable tool for the neuroimaging community, regardless of the domain of any downstream analysis, providing state-of-the-art registration performance that integrates into the rich and widely adopted suite of analysis tools in FSL.",

    "abstract": "Subcortical volumes are a promising source of biomarkers and features in biosignatures, and automated methods facilitate extracting them in large, phenotypically rich datasets. However, while extensive research has verified that the automated methods produce volumes that are similar to those generated by expert annotation; the consistency of methods with each other is understudied. Using data from the UK Biobank, we compare the estimates of subcortical volumes produced by two popular software suites: FSL and FreeSurfer. Although most subcortical volumes exhibit good to excellent consistency across the methods, the tools produce diverging estimates of amygdalar volume. Through simulation, we show that this poor consistency can lead to conflicting results, where one but not the other tool suggests statistical significance, or where both tools suggest a significant relationship but in opposite directions. Considering these issues, we discuss several ways in which care should be taken when reporting on relationships involving amygdalar volume.",

    "abstract": "Fluoxetine is present in breast milk, yet it is unclear to what extent it, or its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, reaches the brain of the infant and what the effects of such exposure on neurobiological processes are. We therefore aimed to quantify the concentration of passively administered fluoxetine and norfluoxetine in the whole brains of exposed Flinders sensitive line (FSL) offspring and establish their influence on serotonergic function and redox status.\nAdult FSL dams received fluoxetine (10\u00a0mg/kg/day), or placebo for fourteen days, beginning on postpartum day 04. Offspring were passively exposed to fluoxetine until postnatal day 18 and euthanized on postnatal day 22. Whole brain fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) concentrations were measured via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis.\nWhole-brain serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations, and serotonin turnover (5-HIAA/5-HT) were comparable between strains. Treatment-na\u00efve FSL rats had lower GSH and higher GSSG whole-brain concentrations, relative to FRL controls, and an overall decreased GSH/GSSG ratio. Passively administered fluoxetine resulted in undetectable whole-brain concentrations, while norfluoxetine averaged 41.28\u2009\u00b1\u20096.47 ng/g. Serotonin turnover of FSL rats was unaffected by passively administered fluoxetine, while redox status (GSH/GSSG) was decreased.\nOur findings confirm that passively administered fluoxetine reaches the infant brain in the form of norfluoxetine and may manipulate processes of oxidative stress regulation. Further studies into the long-term bio-behavioural effects are however needed to effectively inform breast feeding mothers on the safety of antidepressant-use.",

    "abstract": "Bioacoustic event detection is a demanding endeavor involving recognizing and classifying the sounds animals make in their natural habitats. Traditional supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which are hard to come by in bioacoustics. This paper presents a few-shot learning (FSL) method incorporating transductive inference and data augmentation to address the issues of too few labeled events and small volumes of recordings. Here, transductive inference iteratively alters class prototypes and feature extractors to seize essential patterns, whereas data augmentation applies SpecAugment on Mel spectrogram features to augment training data. The proposed approach is evaluated by using the Detecting and Classifying Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2022 and 2021 datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that all components of the proposed method achieve significant F-score improvements of 27% and 10%, for the DCASE-2022 and DCASE-2021 datasets, respectively, compared to recent advanced approaches. Moreover, our method is helpful in FSL tasks because it effectively adapts to sounds from various animal species, recordings, and durations.",

    "abstract": "Subcortical volumes are a promising source of biomarkers and features in biosignatures, and automated methods facilitate extracting them in large, phenotypically rich datasets. However, while extensive research has verified that the automated methods produce volumes that are similar to those generated by expert annotation, the consistency of methods with each other is understudied. Using data from the UK Biobank, we compare the estimates of subcortical volumes produced by two popular software suites: FSL and FreeSurfer. Although most subcortical volumes exhibit good to excellent consistency across the methods, the tools produce diverging estimates of amygdalar volume. Through simulation, we show that this poor consistency can lead to conflicting results, where one but not the other tool suggests statistical significance, or where both tools suggest a significant relationship but in opposite directions. Considering these issues, we discuss several ways in which care should be taken when reporting on relationships involving amygdalar volume.",

    "abstract": "One factor for the lacking integration of the middle ear stapes footplate prosthesis or the missing healing of stapes footplate fractures could be the known osteogenic inactivity. In contrast, it was recently demonstrated that titanium prostheses with an applied collagen matrix and immobilised growth factors stimulate osteoblastic activation and differentiation on the stapes footplate. Regarding those findings, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of bone regeneration including bone remodeling in the middle ear. Ten one-year-old female merino sheep underwent a middle ear surgery without implantation of middle ear prostheses or any other component for activating bone formation. Post-operatively, four fluorochromes (tetracycline, alizarin complexion, calcein green and xylenol orange) were administered by subcutaneous injection at different time points after surgery (1\u00a0day: tetracycline, 7\u00a0days: alizarin, 14\u00a0days: calcein, 28\u00a0days: xylenol). After 12\u00a0weeks, the temporal bones including the lateral skull base were extracted and histologically analyzed. Fluorescence microscopy analysis of the entire stapes with the oval niche, but in particular stapes footplate and the Crura stapedis revealed evidence of new bone formation. Calcein was detected in all and xylenol in 60% of the animals. In contrast, tetracycline and alizarin could only be verified in two animals. The authors were able to demonstrate the osseoregenerative potential of the middle ear, in particular of the stapes footplate, using fluorescence sequence labelling.",

    "abstract": "Delayed therapeutic responses and limited efficacy are the main challenges of existing antidepressant drugs, thereby incentivizing the search for new potential treatments. Cannabidiol (CBD), non-psychotomimetic component of cannabis, has shown promising antidepressant effects in different rodent models, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. Herein, we investigated the antidepressant-like effects of repeated CBD treatment on behavior, neuroplasticity markers and lipidomic profile in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL), a genetic animal model of depression, and their control counterparts Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) rats. Male FSL animals were treated with CBD (10\u00a0mg/kg; i.p.) or vehicle (7 days) followed by Open Field Test (OFT) and the Forced Swimming Test (FST). The PFC was analyzed by a) western blotting to assess markers of synaptic plasticity and cannabinoid signaling in synaptosome and cytosolic fractions; b) mass spectrometry-based lipidomics to investigate endocannabinoid levels (eCB). CBD attenuated the increased immobility observed in FSL, compared to FRL in FST, without changing the locomotor behavior in the OFT. In synaptosomes, CBD increased ERK1, mGluR5, and Synaptophysin, but failed to reverse the reduced CB1 and CB2 levels in FSL rats. In the cytosolic fraction, CBD increased ERK2 and decreased mGluR5 expression in FSL rats. Surprisingly, there were no significant changes in eCB levels in response to CBD treatment. These findings suggest that CBD effects in FSL animals are associated with changes in synaptic plasticity markers involving mGluR5, ERK1, ERK2, and synaptophysin signaling in the PFC, without increasing the levels of endocannabinoids in this brain region.",

    "abstract": "In the current geopolitical climate there is an unmet need to identify and develop prophylactic radiation countermeasures, particularly to ensure the well-being of warfighters and first responders that may be required to perform on radiation-contaminated fields for operational or rescue missions. Currently, no countermeasures have been approved by the U.S. FDA for prophylactic administration. Here we report on the efficacious nature of FSL-1 (toll-like receptor 2/6 agonist) and the protection from acute radiation syndrome (ARS) in a murine total-body irradiation (TBI) model. A single dose of FSL-1 was administered subcutaneously in mice. The safety of the compound was assessed in non-irradiated animals, the efficacy of the compound was assessed in animals exposed to TBI in the AFRRI Co-60 facility, the dose of FSL-1 was optimized, and common hematological parameters [complete blood cell (CBC), cytokines, and bone marrow progenitor cells] were assessed. Animals were monitored up to 60 days after exposure and radiation-induced damage was evaluated. FSL-1 was shown to be non-toxic when administered to non-irradiated mice at doses up to 3 mg/kg. The window of efficacy was determined to be 24 h prior to 24 h after TBI. FSL-1 administration resulted in significantly increased survival when administered either 24 h prior to or 24 h after exposure to supralethal doses of TBI. The optimal dose of FSL-1 administration was determined to be 1.5 mg/kg when administered prior to irradiation. Finally, FSL-1 protected the hematopoietic system (recovery of CBC and bone marrow CFU). Taken together, the effects of increased survival and accelerated recovery of hematological parameters suggests that FSL-1 should be developed as a novel radiation countermeasure for soldiers and civilians, which can be used either before or after irradiation in the aftermath of a radiological or nuclear event.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to validate the estimation of the brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) using synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (SyMRI) by comparison with software tools of the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). In addition to a cross-sectional method comparison, longitudinal volume changes were assessed to further elucidate the suitability of SyMRI for quantification of disease-specific changes.\nMRI data from 216 patients with MS and 28 control participants were included for volume estimation by SyMRI and FSL-SIENAX. Moreover, longitudinal data from 35 patients with MS were used to compare registration-based percentage brain volume changes estimated using FSL-SIENA to difference-based calculations of volume changes using SyMRI.\nWe observed strong correlations of estimated brain volumes between the two methods. While SyMRI overestimated grey matter and BPF compared to FSL-SIENAX, indicating a systematic bias, there was excellent agreement according to intra-class correlation coefficients for grey matter and good agreement for BPF and white matter. Bland-Altman plots suggested that the inter-method differences in BPF were smaller in patients with brain atrophy compared to those without atrophy. Longitudinal analyses revealed a tendency for higher atrophy rates for SyMRI than for SIENA, but SyMRI had a robust correlation and a good agreement with SIENA.\nIn summary, BPF based on data from SyMRI and FSL-SIENAX is not directly transferable because an overestimation and higher variability of SyMRI values were observed. However, the consistency and correlations between the two methods were satisfactory, and SyMRI was suitable to quantify disease-specific atrophy in MS.",

    "abstract": "Thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, anemia, and infection are life-threatening issues following accidental or intentional radiation exposure. Since few therapeutics are available, safe and efficacious small molecules to mitigate radiation-induced injury need to be developed. Our previous study showed the synthetic TLR2/TLR6 ligand fibroblast stimulating lipopeptide (FSL-1) prolonged survival and provided MyD88-dependent mitigation of hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) in mice. Although mice and humans differ in TLR number, expression, and function, nonhuman primate (NHP) TLRs are like those of humans; therefore, studying both animal models is critical for drug development. The objectives of this study were to determine the efficacy of FSL-1 on hematopoietic recovery in small and large animal models subjected to sublethal total body irradiation and investigate its mechanism of action. In mice, we demonstrate a lack of adverse effects, an easy route of delivery (subcutaneous) and efficacy in promoting hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation by FSL-1. NHP given radiation, followed a day later with a single subcutaneous administration of FSL-1, displayed no adversity but showed elevated hematopoietic cells. Our analyses revealed that FSL-1 promoted red blood cell development and induced soluble effectors following radiation exposure. Cytologic analysis of bone marrow aspirates revealed a striking enhancement of mononuclear progenitor cells in FSL-1-treated NHP. Combining the efficacy of FSL-1 in promoting hematopoietic cell recovery with the lack of adverse effects induced by a single administration supports the application of FSL-1 as a viable countermeasure against H-ARS.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to answer the questions of whether early-life (perinatal and/or juvenile) exercise can induce antidepressant-like effects in a validated rodent model of depression, and whether such early-life intervention could prevent or reverse the adverse effects of early-life stress in their offspring.\nMale and female Flinders sensitive line rats born to a dam that exercised during gestation, or not, were either maternally separated between PND02 and 16 and weaned on PND17 or not. Half of these animals then underwent a fourteen-day low-intensity exercise regimen from PND22. Baseline depressive-like behaviour was assessed on PND21 and then reassessed on PND36, whereafter hippocampal monoamine levels, redox state markers and metabolic markers relevant to mitochondrial function were measured.\nPre-pubertal exercise was identified as the largest contributing factor to the observed effects, where it decreased immobility time in the FST by 6%, increased time spent in the open arms of the EPM by 9%. Hippocampal serotonin and norepinephrine levels were also increased by 35% and 26%, respectively, whilst nicotinic acid was significantly decreased.\nThese findings suggest that pre-pubertal low-intensity exercise induces beneficial biological alterations that could translate into antidepressant behaviour in genetically susceptible individuals.",
