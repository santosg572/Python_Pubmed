    "abstract": "The diacylated lipopeptide FSL-1 enhanced the generation of IgG antibodies in TLR2(+/+) mice, but not in TLR2(-/-) mice, when administered together with hen egg lysozyme as an antigen. Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide enhanced the generation of antigen-specific antibodies in both TLR2(-/-) and TLR2(+/+) mice. In TLR2(+/+) mice, the level of enhancement due to FSL-1 was similar to that caused by lipopolysaccharide. Analysis of the IgG antibodies subclass demonstrated that the level of Th2-type IgG1 antibodies was higher than that of Th1-type IgG2a antibodies. Both FSL-1 and lipopolysaccharide induced production of IL-10 and IL-6 by splenocytes from TLR2(+/+) mice. Lipopolysaccharide also induced production of these cytokines by splenocytes from TLR2(-/-) mice, but FSL-1 did not. Neither FSL-1 nor lipopolysaccharide induced IL-12p70 production by splenocytes from either type of mice. FSL-1 upregulated B7.2 expression in B220(+) cells from TLR2(+/+) mice but not those from TLR2(-/-) mice, whereas lipopolysaccharide upregulated B7.2 expression in B220(+) cells from both types of mice. FSL-1 and, to a lesser extent, lipopolysaccharide activated mitogen-activated protein kinases in splenocytes. FSL-1 and, to a lesser extent, lipopolysaccharide induced the expression of c-Fos, which is known to be involved in Th2-type responses, in splenocytes. Thus, this study demonstrated that FSL-1 possessed TLR2-mediated Th2-type responses in vivo.",

    "abstract": "This article presents results obtained from applying various tools from FSL (FMRIB Software Library) to data from the repetition priming experiment used for the HBM'05 Functional Image Analysis Contest. We present analyses from the model-based General Linear Model (GLM) tool (FEAT) and from the model-free independent component analysis tool (MELODIC). We also discuss the application of tools for the correction of image distortions prior to the statistical analysis and the utility of recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) time series modeling and inference such as the use of optimal constrained HRF basis function modeling and mixture modeling inference. The combination of hemodynamic response function (HRF) and mixture modeling, in particular, revealed that both sentence content and speaker voice priming effects occurred bilaterally along the length of the superior temporal sulcus (STS). These results suggest that both are processed in a single underlying system without any significant asymmetries for content vs. voice processing.",

    "abstract": "Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-differentiated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were stimulated with the synthetic lipopeptide S-(2,3-bispalmitoyloxypropyl)-CGDPKHSPKSF (FSL-1) or the Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. FSL-1 induced the production of TNF-alpha and IL-12 by C57BL/6-derived bone marrow-derived dendritic cells but not by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from Toll-like receptor 2-deficient (TLR2(-/-)) mice. Lipopolysaccharide induced the production of TNF-alpha and IL-12 by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells derived from either type of mice. FSL-1 did not induce production of IL-10 by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from either type of mice, whereas lipopolysaccharide induced small amounts of IL-10 by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from both types of mice. The upregulation by FSL-1 of the expression of CD80, CD86 and the MHC class II molecule IA(b) was dose- and time-dependent on the surfaces of C57BL/6-derived bone marrow-derived dendritic cells but not on the surface of TLR2(-/-)-derived bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Lipopolysaccharide upregulated the expression of these molecules on the surfaces of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from both types of mice. The expression of CD11c on the surfaces of C57BL/6-derived bone marrow-derived dendritic cells was upregulated by stimulation with both FSL-1 and lipopolysaccharide up to 12 h; thereafter, the expression was downregulated. The results suggest that FSL-1 can accelerate maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and this FSL-1 activity is mediated by TLR2.",

    "abstract": "Animal models have been used in understanding the neuro-biological basis of depression and predicting successful treatment strategies. The current study focused on two genetic models of depression, the Flinder's Sensitive Line (FSL) and Wister-Kyoto (WKY). Our laboratory showed depressive symptomatology in pre-pubertal WKY and FSL rats, and the current study focused on the strains' anxiety-like traits. Since human depression-anxiety comorbidity is very common at young ages, it is essential to establish whether FSL and WKY pre-pubertal rats also exhibit such comorbidity. In addition, the effect of different rearing environments was studied using a mild chronic-stress condition (limiting available bedding between post-natal days 2-9). Two well-validated tests of anxiety, the open-field and elevated plus-maze, were used on 40-day-old pups. FSL pups exhibited lower anxiety-like behavior when compared to controls, in traditional open-field and plus-maze measures. A different pattern was observed in the WKY strain, which exhibited heightened anxiety-like behaviours in the FSL strain and affecting WKY's body-weight. Overall, the findings indicate differential expression of anxiety in pre-pubertal rats belonging to the 'depressed' strains, suggesting that these strains may be suitable for modelling different sub-groups of depression at young ages.",

    "abstract": "Macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2) from Mycoplasma fermentans has been identified as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern of Mycoplasmas that causes activation of the innate immune system through the activation of the heterodimeric Toll-like receptors (TLRs)-2 and -6. The aim of this study was to characterize the ability of MALP-2 and a synthetic analog fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1 (FSL-1; represents the NH2-terminal sequence of a lipoprotein from M. salivarium) to act as exogenous pyrogens, to induce formation of cytokines (endogenous pyrogens), and to cause sickness behavior, such as depressed motor activity, anorexia, and adipsia. For this purpose, body temperature, activity, food intake, and water intake were recorded for 3 days by use of telemetry devices in several groups of rats treated with MALP-2/FSL-1 or the respective control solutions. Intraperitoneal injections of FSL-1 caused fever at doses of 10 or 100 microg/kg, which was preceded by a pronounced phase of hypothermia in response to a dose of 1,000 microg/kg. The maximal fever (a peak of 1.5 degrees C above baseline) was caused by the 100 microg/kg dose with almost identical responses to both MALP-2 and FSL-1. Fever was accompanied by pronounced rises of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 in plasma. Treatment with the TLR-2 and -6 agonists further induced a dose-dependent manifestation of anorexia and adipsia, as well as a reduction of motor activity. We could thus demonstrate that activation of TLR-2 and -6 can induce systemic inflammation in rats accompanied by the classical signs of brain-controlled illness responses.",
