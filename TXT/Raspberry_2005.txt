    "abstract": "Berry fruits are widely consumed in our diet and have attracted much attention due to their potential human health benefits. Berries contain a diverse range of phytochemicals with biological properties such as antioxidant, anticancer, anti-neurodegerative, and anti-inflammatory activities. In the current study, extracts of six popularly consumed berries--blackberry, black raspberry, blueberry, cranberry, red raspberry and strawberry--were evaluated for their phenolic constituents using high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet (HPLC-UV) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) detection. The major classes of berry phenolics were anthocyanins, flavonols, flavanols, ellagitannins, gallotannins, proanthocyanidins, and phenolic acids. The berry extracts were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of human oral (KB, CAL-27), breast (MCF-7), colon (HT-29, HCT116), and prostate (LNCaP) tumor cell lines at concentrations ranging from 25 to 200 micro g/mL. With increasing concentration of berry extract, increasing inhibition of cell proliferation in all of the cell lines were observed, with different degrees of potency between cell lines. The berry extracts were also evaluated for their ability to stimulate apoptosis of the COX-2 expressing colon cancer cell line, HT-29. Black raspberry and strawberry extracts showed the most significant pro-apoptotic effects against this cell line. The data provided by the current study and from other laboratories warrants further investigation into the chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effects of berries using in vivo models.",

Even more interesting results are the proposal of the 'cyanidin volumetric index', by which it is possible to compare different red raspberry varieties with higher meaningfulness. A new possible correlation between the ratio of chromaticity coordinates 'a/b' and the cyanidin content of red raspberries has been identified.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry extracts enriched in polyphenols, but devoid of organic acids, sugars and vitamin C, were prepared by sorption to C18 solid phase extraction matrices and tested for their ability to inhibit the proliferation of human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells in vitro. The raspberry extract reduced proliferation in a dose-dependent manner whether this was judged by cell number or measurements of cell viability. However, measurements based on cell viability were more accurate and gave an EC(50) value of 17.5 microg/ml gallic acid equivalents (GAE) at day 4 of culture. Raspberry extracts were fractionated by sorption to Sephadex LH-20 into an unbound fraction, which was obviously enriched in anthocyanins, and a bound fraction. The unbound anthocyanin-enriched fraction was much less effective in reducing proliferation then the original extract and gave an EC(50) value estimated at 67 microg/ml. The LH-20 bound fraction was more effective than the original raspberry extract (EC(50)=13 microg/ml) suggesting that the main anti-proliferative agents were retained in the bound fraction. Analysis of the original extract, the unbound and the LH20 bound fractions by LC-MS confirmed that the unbound fraction was enriched in anthocyanins and the bound fraction primarily contained ellagitannins. The ellagitannin-rich bound fraction had the highest antioxidant capacity as measured by the ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) assay. The mechanism by which the ellagitannins inhibit proliferation of cancer cells is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The raspberry cane midge Resseliella theobaldi (Barnes) is one of the most important pests of cultivated red raspberry Rubus idaeus L. throughout Europe. For the last 50 years several studies have been made on the biology, life cycle and control of the pest. Some data can also be found on its natural enemies, but among these species only the chalcidoid Tetrastichus inunctus Nees turned out to be important in controlling raspberry cane midge populations. However, this species name is now ambiguous as the type is lost. In the present study, Aprostocetus epicharmus Walker was the chalcidoid species that parasitized the larvae of the raspberry cane midge, and its biology seems to be very similar to that of T. inunctus. It is therefore probable that the eulophid species earlier referred to as T. inunctus in the literature is A. epicharmus. Besides discussing this problem, particular consideration and detailed data are given on the biology and life cycle of A. epicharmus in relation to R. theobaldi. Different factors having effect on the population dynamics of both species are also discussed as results of a survey on several red raspberry cultivars, carried out in Hungary between 2002 and 2005.",

    "abstract": "Berries have attracted attention for their chemopreventive activities in last a few years. Dietary freeze-dried blackberries have been shown to reduce esophagus and colon cancer development induced by chemical carcinogen in rodents. To elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in chemoprevention by berry extracts, we employed mouse epidermal Cl 41 cell line, a well-characterized in vitro model in tumor promotion studies. Pretreatment of Cl 41 cells with methanol-extracted blackberry fraction RO-ME resulted in a dramatical inhibition of B(a)PDE-induced activation of AP-1 and NFkB, and expression of VEGF and COX-2. The inhibitory effects of RO-ME on B(a)PDE-induced activation of AP-1 and NFkappaB appear to be mediated via inhibition of MAPKs and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, respectively. In view of the important roles of AP-1, NFkappaB, VEGF and COX-2 in tumor promotion/progression, and VEGF and COX-2 are target of AP-1 and NFkappaB, we anticipate that the ability of black raspberries to inhibit tumor development may be mediated by impairing signal transduction pathways leading to activation of AP-1 and NFkappaB, subsequently resulting in down-regulation of VEGF and COX-2 expression. The RO-ME fraction appears to be the major fraction responsible for the inhibitory activity of black raspberries.",

Cold acclimation for a 4-week period prior to cryopreservation was necessary for regrowth of shoot apices from blackberry and raspberry genotypes. For the encapsulation-dehydration protocol, encapsulated apices were pretreated in 0.75 M sucrose for 20 h, desiccated 6-h under laminar flow to c. 20 percent moisture content, then plunged in liquid nitrogen (LN) and rapidly warmed. The PVS2-vitrification protocol included pretreating shoot tips on 5 percent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) medium for 48 h, exposure to loading solution (LS) and PVS2 for 20 min each at 25 degree C , followed by immersion in LN and rapid warming. Shoot tips of 25 genotypes in 9 Rubus species and 9 Rubus hybrids were successfully cryopreserved with recovery of 60 to 100 percent using the encapsulation-dehydration protocol. Four genotypes of 3 species were tested using the vitrification protocol with 71 percent average regrowth. The present results indicate that both of these improved cryopreservation protocols can be applied to a diverse range of Rubus genetic resources.",

    "abstract": "Disease resistance is increasing in importance, as consumers require high-quality raspberry fruit at a time when chemical disease control is undesirable. Breeders have limited resources and rarely include a primary screen for each fungal disease. Marker-assisted breeding would facilitate the introduction of resistance into elite germplasm and breeding lines. An additional 20 simple sequence repeats have been added to the existing raspberry linkage map. Gene H, which determines cane pubescence (genotype HH or Hh), the recessive allele of which gives glabrous canes (genotype hh), has been mapped on to linkage group 2 and shown to be closely associated with resistance to cane botrytis and spur blight but not rust or cane spot. Other map regions on linkage groups 3, 5 and 6 associated with disease resistance are reported here.",

The review concentrates on the methods of antioxidant testing, the diversity of antioxidants in raspberry, effects of ripeness, cultivar, storage and processing techniques, and the bioavailability of raspberry antioxidants in humans after eating the fruit. It is clear that raspberry, like several other fruits and vegetables such as tomato, strawberry, kiwi and broccoli, represents a valuable contrasting source of potentially healthy compounds and can represent an important component of a balanced diet.",

    "abstract": "Anthocyanins are the most abundant phenolic compounds, widely distributed in fruits and vegetables, and exhibit potent antioxidant capacity. Humans ingest a significant amount of anthocyanins in the daily diet. The objective of the current study was to examine human absorption and metabolism of black raspberry anthocyanins when administered at high doses (2.69 +/- 0.085 g/day). Ten healthy men consumed 45 g of freeze-dried black raspberries daily for 1 week. Urine samples were collected over a 12 h period in 4 h intervals at day 1 and day 7. Urinary anthocyanins were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a photodiode array detector and a tandem mass spectrometer using precursor ion and product ion analyses. Anthocyanins were excreted in intact forms and metabolized into methylated derivatives in human urine. The urinary excretion of anthocyanins reached a maximum concentration (1091.8 +/- 1081.3 pmol/L, n = 10) during the 4-8 h period after black raspberry ingestion. As compared to the anthocyanin distribution in black raspberries, urinary cyanidin 3-xylosylrutinoside was detected at a higher concentration than that of cyanidin-3-rutinoside.",

    "abstract": "Many fruits are rich in anthocyanins (ACNs). ACNs have high antioxidant capacity, but because of their apparent low bioavailability, their possible roles in health promotion in vivo are still in question. The objectives of these studies were to determine the fate of ACNs within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the effect on the bioavailability and subsequent metabolism of ACNs. Five weanling pigs were fed freeze-dried black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis L.) powder by oral administration, which provided 1146.1 +/- 44.6 micromol TE of oxygen radical absorbance capacity with fluorescein as a fluorescent probe (ORAC(FL)) per kg and 50.5 +/- 3.7 mg per kg total ACNs. After 4 h, the pigs were sacrificed and the contents of five GI segments (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon) were collected and analyzed for their total antioxidant capacity (TAC, measured as ORAC(FL)) and ACNs. The recoveries of TAC and total ACNs were 46.5 +/- 3.5 and 41.7 +/- 4.9%, respectively. Both total ACNs and TAC were recovered primarily in the ileum, cecum, and colon at 4 h after a meal. Cyanidin aglycone with different sugar moieties showed significant differences in their recovery within the GI tract with sambubiose > sambubiose-rhamnose = rutinose >> glucose. Recovery of ACNs within the GI tract was positively and linearly associated with urinary ACN recovery, which suggests that stability within the GI tract and not decreased absorption accounts for the increased recovery. The environment of different segments of the GI tract may determine the stability of individual ACNs. Complex ACNs containing di- or triglycosides disappeared more slowly in the GI tract than simple ACNs such as a monoglycoside. TAC and total ACNs remained high 4 h after feeding, which indicates that ACNs provide significant antioxidant protection in the environment of the gut epithelium.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that freeze-dried black raspberry extract fractions inhibit benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P]-induced transformation of Syrian hamster embryo cells and benzo(a)pyrene diol-epoxide [B(a)PDE]-induced activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity in mouse epidermal Cl 41 cells. The phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt pathway is critical for B(a)PDE-induced AP-1 activation in mouse epidermal Cl 41 cells. In the present study, we determined the potential involvement of PI-3K and its downstream kinases on the inhibition of AP-1 activation by black raspberry fractions, RO-FOO3, RO-FOO4, RO-ME, and RO-DM. In addition, we investigated the effects of these fractions on the expression of the AP-1 target genes, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Pretreatment of Cl 41 cells with fractions RO-F003 and RO-ME reduced activation of AP-1 and the expression of VEGF, but not iNOS. In contrast, fractions RO-F004 and RO-DM had no effect on AP-1 activation or the expression of either VEGF or iNOS. Consistent with inhibition of AP-1 activation, the RO-ME fraction markedly inhibited activation of PI-3K, Akt, and p70 S6 kinase (p70(S6k)). In addition, overexpression of the dominant negative PI-3K mutant delta p85 reduced the induction of VEGF by B(a)PDE. It is likely that the inhibitory effects of fractions RO-FOO3 and RO-ME on B(a)PDE-induced AP-1 activation and VEGF expression are mediated by inhibition of the PI-3K/Akt pathway. In view of the important roles of AP-1 and VEGF in tumor development, one mechanism for the chemopreventive activity of black raspberries may be inhibition of the PI-3K/Akt/AP-1/VEGF pathway.",

The effects of pH and salt electrolyte on the morphology of the self-assembled polymer composites were investigated. The resulting heterocoagulates were highly stable in water and acid solution. These heterocoagulates were reversible through the self-assembly in acidic or neutral media and the dissociation in the basic medium due to the charge compensation through the strong affinity complex between hydroxide anion and pyridinium group cation. The resulting heterocoagulates were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).

Phenolic extracts and isolated fractions of the selected materials were investigated for antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, and antimutagenic properties as well as for cell permeability. It was shown that rapeseed and pine bark phenolics and raspberry anthocyanins were good or excellent antioxidants toward oxidation of phosphatidylcholine membrane (liposomes), rapeseed oil (crude) phenolics were effective radical scavengers (DPPH test), and both raspberry and pine bark phenolics inhibited LDL oxidation. Rapeseed oil phenolics, principally vinylsyringol, raspberry anthocyanins, and pinoresinol and matairesinol, the principal components of pine bark phenolic isolate, were effective against formation of the proinflammatory mediator, prostaglandin E(2). Raspberry ellagitannins inhibited the growth of Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella oxytoca. Pine bark and rapeseed had minor effects on the permeability of model drugs in Caco-2 experiments. None of the tested extracts were mutagenic nor toxic to Caco-2 cells or macrophages. Thus, phenolic isolates from rapeseed, raspberry, and pine bark and are safe and bioactive for possible food applications including functional foods intended for health benefit.",

    "abstract": "The bioavailability of anthocyanins from raspberry extracts was assessed using an in vitro digestion procedure that mimics the physiochemical and biochemical changes that occur in the upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Effectively all of the total phenol content of the raspberry extract survived gastric digestion and partitioned between the IN sample, which represents the serum available material, and the OUT sample, which represents the material that remains in the GIT and passes through to the colon. All of the anthocyanins also survived gastric digestion, but only approximately 5% entered the IN sample and approximately 70% of total anthocyanins were recovered in the IN and OUT samples. Codigestion of the raspberry extract with commonly combined foodstuffs such as bread, breakfast cereal, ice cream, and cooked minced beef gave a different pattern. The total phenol content of the IN samples was slightly reduced by codigestion with ice cream or breakfast cereal but unaffected by codigestion with bread or minced beef. In most cases, the phenol contents of the postgastric and OUT samples were reduced as compared with the expected values. However, the anthocyanin content of the IN samples was unaffected or increased by coincubation with the foodstuffs. This suggests that polyphenols transiently bind to food matrices during digestion, which protects the more labile anthocyanins from degradation, and they are free to diffuse into the IN sample. The anthocyanin composition of the bioavailability samples was monitored by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. All eight anthocyanins previously identified in raspberry were detected in the extract and the postgastric samples at similar yields. All eight anthocyanins could be discerned in the IN and OUT samples, but some such as cyanidin-3-O-glucoside were greatly reduced and others such as pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside were apparently increased in abundance. These differences in stability and their importance for the bioavailability of anthocyanins are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Bulbophyllum apertum flower (Orchidaceae) releases raspberry ketone (RK) in its fragrance, which attracts males of several fruit fly species belonging to the genus Bactrocera. Besides RK as a major component, the flower contains smaller amounts of 4-(4-hydroxylphenyl)-2-butanol, plus two minor volatile components, veratryl alcohol and vanillyl alcohol. Within the flower, the lip (labellum) had the highest concentration of RK with much smaller quantities present in petals; other flower parts had no detectable RK. Male fruit flies attracted to the flower belong to RK-sensitive species--such as Bactrocera albistragata, B. caudatus, B. cucurbitae (melon fly), and B. tau. Removal and attachment of the pollinarium to a fly's thoracic dorsum occurred when a male of B. albistragata was toppled into the floral column cavity, due to an imbalance caused by it shifting its body weight while feeding on the see-saw lip, and then freeing itself after being momentarily trapped between the lip and column. During this process, the stiff hamulus (the pollinia stalk protruding prominently towards the lip) acted as a crowbar when it was brushed downwards by the toppled fly and lifted the pollinia out of the anther. If the fly was big or long for the small triangular lip, it would not be toppled into the column cavity and would just walk across the column, during which time the pollinarium could be accidentally removed by the fly's leg, resulting in a failed transport of the pollinarium. This suggests an unstable situation, where the orchid relies only on a particular pollinator species in the complex ecosystem where many RK-sensitive species inhabit. Wild males of B. caudatus (most common visitors) captured on Bulbophyllum apertum flowers were found to sequester RK in their bodies as a potential pheromonal and allomonal ingredient. Thus, RK can act either as a floral synomone (pollinarium transported) or kairomone (accidental removal of pollinarium leading to total pollen wastage), depending on the body size of the male fruit flies visiting the flowers.",

    "abstract": "Targeted therapies, such as agents that inhibit angiogenesis, offer hope as complementary agents in cancer therapy. Angiogenesis-inhibiting agents have the potential for inhibiting tumor growth and limiting the dissemination of metastasis, thus keeping cancers in a static growth state for prolonged periods. Black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) extract was discovered to be antiangiogenic (0.1% w/v) in a novel human tissue-based in vitro fibrin clot angiogenesis assay. Assay-guided fractionation of a crude black raspberry extract resulted in a highly potent antiangiogenic fraction that accounted for only 1% of the fresh weight of whole black raspberries. At 0.075% (w/v), the active fraction completely inhibited angiogenic initiation and angiogenic vessel growth. Further subfractionation of this active fraction revealed the coexistence of multiple antiangiogenic compounds, one of which has been identified as gallic acid. However, the individual subfractions did not outperform the active whole fraction. These findings suggest that an active black raspberry fraction may be a promising complementary cancer therapy. It is natural and potent enough for manageable dosing regimens. These extracts contain multiple active ingredients that may be additive or synergistic in their antiangiogenic effects. These observations warrant further investigations in animals and human trials.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl) butan-2-one; RK) is a major aromatic compound of red raspberry (Rubus idaeus). The structure of RK is similar to the structures of capsaicin and synephrine, compounds known to exert anti-obese actions and alter the lipid metabolism. The present study was performed to clarify whether RK helps prevent obesity and activate lipid metabolism in rodents. To test the effect on obesity, our group designed the following in vivo experiments: 1) mice were fed a high-fat diet including 0.5, 1, or 2% of RK for 10 weeks; 2) mice were given a high-fat diet for 6 weeks and subsequently fed the same high-fat diet containing 1% RK for the next 5 weeks. RK prevented the high-fat-diet-induced elevations in body weight and the weights of the liver and visceral adipose tissues (epididymal, retroperitoneal, and mesenteric). RK also decreased these weights and hepatic triacylglycerol content after they had been increased by a high-fat diet. RK significantly increased norepinephrine-induced lipolysis associated with the translocation of hormone-sensitive lipase from the cytosol to lipid droplets in rat epididymal fat cells. In conclusion, RK prevents and improves obesity and fatty liver. These effects appear to stem from the action of RK in altering the lipid metabolism, or more specifically, in increasing norepinephrine-induced lipolysis in white adipocytes.",

    "abstract": "The presence of antioxidant compounds can be considered as a quality parameter for edible fruit. In this paper, we studied the antioxidant compounds in raspberry (Rubus idaeus) fruits by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to an on-line postcolumn antioxidant detection system. Both developmental and genetic factors were assessed by comparing fruits from a single cultivar of different ripening stages and by comparing ripe fruits of 14 raspberry cultivars, respectively. The HPLC-separated antioxidant compounds were identified using HPLC-photodiode array coupled to mass spectrometry (quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry), using a reference lock mass for determining accurate masses. The dominant antioxidants could be classified as anthocyanins, ellagitannins, and proanthocyanidin-like tannins. During fruit ripening, some anthocyanins were newly produced, while others, like cyanidin-3-glucoside, were already present early in fruit development. The level of tannins, both ellagitannins and proanthocyanidin-like tannins, was reduced strongly during fruit ripening. Among the 14 cultivars, major differences (>20-fold) were observed in the levels of pelagonidin type anthocyanins and some proanthocyanidin type tannins. The content of ellagitannins varied approximately 3-fold. The findings presented here suggest that the content of individual health-promoting compounds varies significantly in raspberry, due to both developmental and genetic factors. This information will assist in the future development and identification of raspberry lines with enhanced health-promoting properties.",

EnVi resulted in higher survival (85%) and regrowth (75%) of cryopreserved shoot tips than EnDe (65 and 50%, respectively). In both cryogenic procedures, shoots regenerated from cryopreserved shoot tips without intermediary callus formation. Histological studies showed that a much larger number of meristematic cells survived following EnVi than EnDe. The EnVi procedure was applied to seven raspberry genotypes with an average survival and regrowth of 71 and 68%, respectively. Regenerated plants showed normal morphology.

Total tocopherol was 260.6-2276.9 mumoles per kg oil, including alpha-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherols. OSI values were 20.07, 20.30, and 44.76 h for the marionberry, red raspberry, and boysenberry seed oils, respectively. The highest TPC of 2.0 mg gallic acid equivalents per gram of oil was observed in the red raspberry seed oil, while the strongest oxygen radical absorbance capacity was in boysenberry seed oil extract (77.9 micromol trolox equivalents per g oil). All tested berry seed oils directly reacted with and quenched DPPH radicals in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These data suggest that the cold-pressed berry seed oils may serve as potential dietary sources of tocopherols, carotenoids, and natural antioxidants.",
