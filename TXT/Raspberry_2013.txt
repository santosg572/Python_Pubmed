    "abstract": "Yellow Himalayan raspberry, a wild edible fruit, was analyzed for phenolic contents, and antioxidant, antibacterial and antiproliferative activities. Phenolics were extracted using 80\u00a0% aqueous solvents containing methanol, acidic methanol, acetone and acidic acetone. Our analysis revealed that the acidic acetone extracts recovered the highest level of total phenolics (899\u00a0mg GAE/100\u00a0g FW) and flavonoids (433.5\u00a0mg CE/100\u00a0g FW). Free radical scavenging activities (DPPH, ABTS, superoxide and linoleate hydroperoxide radicals) and ferric reducing activity were highest in the acetone and acidic acetone extracts. No metal chelating or antibacterial activity was detected in any of the extracts. Acetone and methanol extracts showed potent antiproliferative activity against human cervical cancer cells (C33A) with an EC50 of inhibition at 5.04 and 4. 9\u00a0mg/ml fruit concentration respectively, while showing no cytotoxicity to normal PBMCs cells. Therefore, the present study concluded that the yellow Himalayan raspberry is a potent source of phytochemicals having super antioxidant and potent antiproliferative activities.",

    "abstract": "Efficacy of R. fruticosus leaves extract in stabilizing sunflower oil during accelerated storage has been studied. Extracts of R. fruticosus were prepared in different solvents which methanolic extract yield with 15.43\u00a0% was higher than water and acetone ones (11.87 and 6.62\u00a0%, respectively). Methanolic extract was chosen to evaluate its thermal stability at 70\u00a0\u00b0C in sunflower oil, due to the highest yield, antioxidant and antiradical potential and also high content of phenolic compounds campared to other solvents. So, different concentrations of methanolic extract (200, 400, 600, 800 and 1,000\u00a0ppm) were added to sunflower oil. BHA and BHT at 200\u00a0ppm served as standards besides the control. Peroxide value (PV) and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) were taken as parameters for evaluation of effectiveness of R. fruticosus leaves extract in stabilization of sunflower oil. Moreover, antioxidant activity index (AAI) of the extract at 120\u00a0\u00b0C at rancimat were conducted. Results from different parameters were in agreement with each other, suggesting the highest efficiency of 1,000\u00a0ppm of the extract followed by BHT, BHA and other concentrations of the extract. Results reveal the R. fruticosus leaves extract to be a potent antioxidant for stabilization of sunflower oil.",

    "abstract": "The raspberry weevil, Aegorhinus superciliosus (Gu\u00e9rin) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is an economically important pest of blueberry in southern Chile. The digestive protease activity of adult insects was investigated using general and specific substrates and inhibitors. Enzymatic assays demonstrated the presence of trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases. Furthermore, in vitro assays using phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) at 0.01 and 0.1 mM showed percentages of enzymatic inhibition between 0 and 16% for PMSF and 67 to 76% for SBTI, whereas in vivo assays indicated that SBTI caused between 50 and 90% mortality in males and between 80 and 100% in females. Our data indicate the presence of serine proteases and suggest that digestive proteases could be a target for the design and development of strategies to control the raspberry weevil.",

    "abstract": "Second language learners perform worse than native speakers under adverse listening conditions, such as speech in noise (SPIN). No data are available on heritage language speakers' (early naturalistic interrupted learners') ability to perceive SPIN. The current study fills this gap and investigates the perception of Russian speech in multi-talker babble noise by the matched groups of high- and low-proficiency heritage speakers (HSs) and late second language learners of Russian who were native speakers of English. The study includes a control group of Russian native speakers. It manipulates the noise level (high and low), and context cloze probability (high and low). The results of the SPIN task are compared to the tasks testing the control of phonology, AXB discrimination and picture-word discrimination, and lexical knowledge, a word translation task, in the same participants. The increased phonological sensitivity of HSs interacted with their ability to rely on top-down processing in sentence integration, use contextual cues, and build expectancies in the high-noise/high-context condition in a bootstrapping fashion. HSs outperformed oral proficiency-matched late second language learners on SPIN task and two tests of phonological sensitivity. The outcomes of the SPIN experiment support both the early naturalistic advantage and the role of proficiency in HSs. HSs' ability to take advantage of the high-predictability context in the high-noise condition was mitigated by their level of proficiency. Only high-proficiency HSs, but not any other non-native group, took advantage of the high-predictability context that became available with better phonological processing skills in high-noise. The study thus confirms high-proficiency (but not low-proficiency) HSs' nativelike ability to combine bottom-up and top-down cues in processing SPIN.",

    "abstract": "The value of a teaching case repository in radiology training programs is immense. The allocation of resources for putting one together is a complex issue, given the factors that have to be coordinated: hardware, software, infrastructure, administration, and ethics. Costs may be significant and cost-effective solutions are desirable.\nWe chose Medical Imaging Resource Center (MIRC) to build our teaching file. It is offered by RSNA for free. For the hardware, we chose the Raspberry Pi, developed by the Raspberry Foundation: a small control board developed as a low cost computer for schools also used in alternative projects such as robotics and environmental data collection. Its performance and reliability as a file server were unknown to us. For the operational system, we chose Raspbian, a variant of Debian Linux, along with Apache (web server), MySql (database server) and PHP, which enhance the functionality of the server. A USB hub and an external hard drive completed the setup. Installation of software was smooth.\nThe Raspberry Pi was able to handle very well the task of hosting the teaching file repository for our division. Uptime was logged at 100 %, and loading times were similar to other MIRC sites available online. We setup two servers (one for backup), each costing just below $200.00 including external storage and USB hub.\nIt is feasible to run RSNA's MIRC off a low-cost control board (Raspberry Pi). Performance and reliability are comparable to full-size servers for the intended purpose of hosting a teaching file within an intranet environment.",

    "abstract": "A smart city application has been realized and tested. It is a fully remote controlled isle of lamp posts based on new technologies. It has been designed and organized in different hierarchical layers, which perform local activities to physically control the lamp posts and transmit information with another for remote control. Locally, each lamp post uses an electronic card for management and a ZigBee tlc network transmits data to a central control unit, which manages the whole isle. The central unit is realized with a Raspberry-Pi control card due to its good computing performance at very low price. Finally, a WiMAX connection was tested and used to remotely control the smart grid, thus overcoming the distance limitations of commercial Wi-Fi networks. The isle has been realized and tested for some months in the field.",

    "abstract": "We describe the influence of microgel packing on colloidal-phase mediated heteroaggregation using poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and poly(N-isopropylmethacrylamide) microgels with 1% mol or 5% mol N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) cross-linker. This system is uniquely designed to interrogate the influence of microgel structure and stiffness on microgel deformation at a curved interface by elminating the necessity of electrostatic charge pairing. Microgel monomer and cross-linker content is expected to influence deformation at a curved interface. Microgel deformation and swelling were characterized via atomic force microscopy (AFM) and viscometry. A systematic study of colloidal-phase mediated heteroaggregation was performed at varied effective volume fractions with all microgel compositions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and qNano pore translocation experiments were used to asses the microgel coverage on the resultant raspberry-like particles (RLPs). Results reveal that microgel composition has a strong influence on the efficiency (as determined by microgel coverage) of RLP fabrication. The compositional effects appear to be related to the degree of microgel spreading/deformation at the interface, which is coupled to the influence of packing on assembly fidelity. These findings are widely applicable to systems where microgel deformation occurs at a curved interface. We also demonstrate that qNano pore translocation experiments can be used as a high-throughput method to analyze RLP microgel coverage.",

    "abstract": "Polyphenolic compounds (anthocyanins, flavonoid glycosides) in berries prevent the initiation, promotion, and progression of carcinogenesis in rat's digestive tract and esophagus, in part, via anti-inflammatory pathways. Angiogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects of black raspberry extract (BRE) on two organ specific primary human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells, (HIMEC) and human esophageal microvascular endothelial cells (HEMEC), isolated from surgically resected human intestinal and donor discarded esophagus, respectively. HEMEC and HIMEC were stimulated with TNF-\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2 with or without BRE. The anti-inflammatory effects of BRE were assessed based upon COX-2, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 gene and protein expression, PGE2 production, NF\u03baB p65 subunit nuclear translocation as well as endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion. The anti-angiogenic effects of BRE were assessed on cell migration, proliferation and tube formation following VEGF stimulation as well as on activation of Akt, MAPK and JNK signaling pathways. BRE inhibited TNF-\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2-induced NF\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation, PGE2 production, up-regulation of COX-2, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 gene and protein expression and leukocyte binding in HEMEC but not in HIMEC. BRE attenuated VEGF-induced cell migration, proliferation and tube formation in both HEMEC and HIMEC. The anti-angiogenic effect of BRE is mediated by inhibition of Akt, MAPK and JNK phosphorylations. BRE exerted differential anti-inflammatory effects between HEMEC and HIMEC following TNF-\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2 activation whereas demonstrated similar anti-angiogenic effects following VEGF stimulation in both cell lines. These findings may provide more insight into the anti-tumorigenic capacities of BRE in human disease and cancer.",

The objectives of this study were to determine which Phytophthora species are involved in root rot, examine the efficacy of different isolation methods (cane, root, and root/soil baiting with young raspberry plants), and determine if pathogenicity, fungicide resistance, and/or genetic variation exists among P. rubi isolates collected from raspberry fields in Washington, Oregon, and California. Of 275 samples, direct isolation from cane material resulted in a greater number of P. rubi isolates (39%), whereas root/soil baiting yielded the least (11%). Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of 210 of the total 597 collected Phytophthora isolates showed that all but one isolate (identified as P. bisheria) were P. rubi. Results of the pathogenicity and fungicide resistance to mefenoxam comparing 14 total isolates from Washington, Oregon, and California showed that isolates were similarly virulent against red raspberry and the EC",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK) is a natural phenolic compound of red raspberry. The dietary intake of RK has been reported to exert anti-obese actions and alter the lipid metabolism in vivo and human studies.\nTo elucidate a possible mechanism for anti-obese actions of RK, the effects of RK on the adipogenic and lipogenic gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes were investigated.\n3T3-L1 maturing pre-adipocytes were treated from day 2 to day 8 of differentiation and mature adipocytes for 24 h on day 12 with 1, 10, 20, and 50 \u03bcM of RK. Triacylglycerols were assessed by spectrophotometry and gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).\nTreatment of adipocytes with RK suppressed adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. RK suppressed the expression of major genes involved in the adipogenesis pathway including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) and CCAAT enhancer binding protein-\u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1), which led to further down-regulation of adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein-2 (aP2). In addition, treatment with 10 \u03bcM of RK also reduced mRNA levels of lipogenic genes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1). In mature adipocytes, RK increased the transcriptional activities of genes involved in lipolysis and the oxidative pathways including adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1B (CPT1B).\nThese findings suggest that RK holds great promise for an herbal medicine with the biological activities altering the lipid metabolism in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",

RK suppressed the expression of major genes involved in the adipogenesis pathway including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) and CCAAT enhancer binding protein-\u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1), which led to further down-regulation of adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein-2 (aP2). In addition, treatment with 10 \u03bcM of RK also reduced mRNA levels of lipogenic genes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1). In mature adipocytes, RK increased the transcriptional activities of genes involved in lipolysis and the oxidative pathways including adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1B (CPT1B).",

    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to assess the differences in fermentative behaviour of two different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (EC1118 and RC212) and to determine the differences in composition and sensory properties of raspberry wines fermented with immobilized and suspended yeast cells of both strains at 15\u2009\u00b0C. Analyses of aroma compounds, glycerol, acetic acid and ethanol, as well as the kinetics of fermentation and a sensory evaluation of the wines, were performed. All fermentations with immobilized yeast cells had a shorter lag phase and faster utilization of sugars and ethanol production than those fermented with suspended cells. Slower fermentation kinetics were observed in all the samples that were fermented with strain RC212 (suspended and immobilized) than in samples fermented with strain EC1118. Significantly higher amounts of acetic acid were detected in all samples fermented with strain RC212 than in those fermented with strain EC1118 (0.282 and 0.602\u2009g/l, respectively). Slightly higher amounts of glycerol were observed in samples fermented with strain EC1118 than in those fermented with strain RC212.",

    "abstract": "The plant-parasitic nematode Pratylenchus penetrans is a major constraint to the production of red raspberry. To determine whether several popular raspberry cultivars in Washington State differ in susceptibility to P. penetrans and whether post-plant nematicides treatments are warranted, five independent, multiyear trials were conducted. Trials in existing plantings of 'Cascade Bounty', 'Chemainus', 'Meeker' (two trials), and 'Saanich' raspberry were established in northwest Washington. Treated plots were protected from P. penetrans by applying nematicides over a 3-year period, while nontreated plots received no nematicides. P. penetrans population densities in soil and root samples were assessed spring and fall of each year. In addition, impact of P. penetrans on raspberry yield, fruit composition, cane production, and root biomass was measured several times in each cultivar during the 3-year study. P. penetrans root population densities in nematicide-treated plots were consistently lower than those in nontreated plots at all the samplings. There were few consistent treatment differences in fine root biomass, the preferred feeding sites for P. penetrans. However, a complete root system sampling of one of the cultivars did show greater fine root biomass in treated plants compared with nontreated plants. When differences were observed aboveground, treated plants yielded less than corresponding nontreated plants, indicating that the nematicides may have been phytotoxic to some of the cultivars. This study suggests that post-plant nematicide applications are of limited benefit because, at least during the 3-year time period of this study, there were few observable benefits of protecting these raspberry cultivars from P. penetrans.",

A red raspberry fruit extract was characterized in terms of phenolic content and the anti-inflammatory properties and protective effects were evaluated in two experimental models of inflammation. The antioxidant potential of the extract, the cellular antioxidant activity and the effects over neutrophils' oxidative burst were also studied to provide a mechanistic insight for the anti-inflammatory effects observed. The extract was administered in a dose of 15 mg kg(-1), i.p. and significantly inhibited paw oedema formation in the rat. The same dose was administered via i.p. and p.o. routes in the collagen-induced arthritis model in the rat. The extract showed pharmacological activity and was able to significantly reduce the development of clinical signs of arthritis and markedly reduce the degree of bone resorption, soft tissue swelling and osteophyte formation, preventing articular destruction in treated animals.",

    "abstract": "Previous works on staghorn sumac (Rhus hirta) were mostly dedicated to its phytochemical profiles, antioxidant properties, and antidiabetic potentials. This study explored the potential of staghorn-sumac-derived functional ingredients for food and pharmacological applications. Sumac may have other biological functions, such as inhibitory effect on cancerous cells independent of its antioxidant properties. We characterized sumac and raspberry interactions, and their antioxidant capacities (ACs) and their inhibitory effect on both normal and cancerous cells. Mixing sumac and raspberry extracts yielded significantly higher ACs than the sum of sumac and raspberry as evaluated by three in vitro AC assays. However, the potential use of staghorn sumac as a natural source of dietary antioxidant supplement for oxidative-stress-related disorders might be challenged by its cytotoxicity in culturing normal cells. Remarkably, mixing sumac and raspberry showed maximal inhibition of the growth of both rat colon and human breast cancer cells with relatively low cytotoxicity toward normal rat colon and human breast epithelial cells, as compared with sumac or raspberry treatment alone. Sumac-derived products and their synergistic interactions with other food ingredients have great promise as functional food or nutraceutical products that would target cancer cells with minimal toxic effects to normal cells.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to determine the expression of caspase-14, a key protein in maturation of squamous epithelia, in archival malignant and premalignant vulvar squamous lesions and examine in-vitro effects of a black raspberry extract (BRB-E) on a vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) cell line.\nVSCC cell cultures were exposed to different BRB-E concentrations and used to create cell blocks. Immunohistochemistry for caspase-14 was performed on cell block sections, whole tissue sections, and a tissue microarray consisting of normal vulvar skin, lichen sclerosus (LS), classic and differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (cVIN and dVIN respectively), and VSCC.\nLS demonstrated abnormal full thickness (5/11) or absent (1/11) caspase-14 staining. dVIN often showed markedly reduced expression (4/7), and cVIN occasionally demonstrated either absent or reduced caspase-14 (6/22). VSCC predominantly had absent or markedly reduced caspase-14 (26/28). VSCC cell cultures demonstrated a significant increase in caspase-14 (p=0.013) after BRB-E treatment: 7.3% (\u00b12.0%) of untreated cells showed caspase-14 positivity, while 21.3% (\u00b18.9%), 21.7% (\u00b14.8%), and 22.6% (\u00b15.3%) of cells were positive for caspase-14 after treatment with 200, 400, and 800 \u03bcg/mL BRB-E, respectively. Pair-wise comparisons between the treatment groups and the control demonstrated significant differences between no treatment with BRB-E and each of these treatment concentrations (Dunnett's adjusted p-values: 0.024, 0.021, and 0.014, respectively).\nCaspase-14 is frequently decreased in premalignant and malignant vulvar squamous lesions, and is upregulated in VSCC cell culture by BRB-E. BRB-E should be further explored and may ultimately be incorporated in topical preparations.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry juice-milk is an acidic dairy drink (ADD) including two main phases, milk phase (pH: 6.6-6.7) and raspberry juice phase (pH: 3.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1). Due to the low pH in this beverage, milk protein sedimentation is usual problem and therefore hydrocolloid is added as a stabilizer. Thus, in current study the influences of pectin, CMC and Kappa-carrageenan on the stability of the milk-raspberry juice drink and their blend synergistic effect were investigated. For this purpose milk-raspberry juice drink samples were prepared using pure pectin, CMC and Kappa-carrageenan at concentrations of 0.2\u00a0%, 0.3\u00a0% and 0.35\u00a0% respectively. Blends of pectin and Carboxymethylcellulose (ratios of 25:75, 33.4:66.6 and 34.3:65.7) at concentrations of 0.2\u00a0%, 0.3\u00a0% and 0.35\u00a0%, were added during a certain process. Moreover, the stabilization mechanisms were studied using apparent viscosity and sedimentation percent measurements. Based on the findings of the present study, the best fitted samples were the ones containing the blends of pectin and Carboxymethylcellulose which were more stable and viscose than samples including pure Carboxymethylcellulose (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Kappa-carrageenan can not prevent casein agglomeration in raspberry juice-milk individually, but in the presence of CMC or CMC and pectin it produces a stable drink. In general, with utilizing synergistic effect of gum blend we can use lower gum concentration and decrease cost during manufacture.",

    "abstract": "For the development of an intracellular cargo release system with mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN), gold nanoparticles coated with an amyloidogenic protein of \u03b1-synuclein were employed to prepare a protein-mediated nanocomposite into the \"raspberry-type\" particles-on-a-particle (PoP). The PoPs were successfully fabricated only at pH 4.4 by yielding the MSN coverage to 75.3% with 5 nm gold nanoparticles covalently coated with a mutant form of \u03b1-synuclein containing a cysteine residue at the C-terminus. The entrapped cargo of rhodamine 6G was shown to be selectively released from PoPs upon exposure to divalent cations including the \u03b1-synuclein-specific pathophysiological ligand of Ca(2+). Intracellular uptake of the PoPs preloaded with doxorubicin as an anticancer drug and its subsequent Ca(2+)-dependent release were demonstrated with HeLa cells in the presence of intracellular Ca(2+)-regulating agents. Therefore, the fabrication of PoPs with the self-interactive protein of \u03b1-synuclein is expected to serve as a platform technology for preparation of diversified nanocomposites with various nanoparticles and/or bioactive molecules for eventual applications in the areas of theranostics.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) raspberry-like CuCr2O4 spinel nanoparticles were prepared hydrothermally in the presence of cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Detailed characterization of the material was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). XRD revealed the formation of CuCr2O4 spinel phase, and SEM showed the formation of a 3D raspberry-like structure, composed of 20-50 nm nanoparticles. The raspberry-like particles exhibited excellent catalytic behavior for the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol with H2O2. The influence of reaction parameters were investigated in detail. A benzene conversion of 68.5% with 95% phenol selectivity was achieved at 80 \u00b0C. The catalyst did not show any leaching up to 10 reuses, showing the true heterogeneity of the catalyst. However, significant H2O2 decomposition occurs on the catalyst necessitating its use in 5-fold excess.",

    "abstract": "In February 2013 in coastal California (Santa Cruz County), plantings of red raspberry (Rubus idaeus var. strigosus) exhibited symptoms of a previously undocumented disease. Initial symptoms were small (less than 5 mm wide), angular, water-soaked lesions on leaf and petiole tissues of recently emerged foliage. Lesions were observable from both adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces. As disease progressed, lesions enlarged and coalesced, resulting in significant dark brown to black blighting of the foliage. The foliage of severely affected plants was stunted and wilted. The disease affected 5 ha and incidence was approximately 30%. Cream-colored bacterial colonies were isolated from surface disinfested symptomatic tissue that was macerated and streaked onto King's medium B (KMB) and sucrose peptone agar (SPA). Fungi were not recovered from any tissue that was surface disinfested and placed into acidified potato dextrose agar. Four representative strains were fluorescent on KMB and gram-negative based on lysis by KOH. Strains were positive for levan formation, negative for oxidase and arginine dihydrolase, and did not cause soft rot on potato slices but induced a hypersensitive response in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Samsun); strains thus belonged to Lelliot's LOPAT group 1, P. syringae (3). All four strains had identical DNA fragment-banding patterns generated by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence (rep)-PCR using the BOXA1R primer (4). The pattern generated was different than all P. syringae pathovars in genomospecies 1 including P. syringae pv. syringae. According to multilocus sequence analysis conducted by previously described methods, the strains are most closely related to P. syringae pv. aceris and P. syringae pv. solidagae in genomospecies 1 (1). Potted raspberry plants were used to test four strains for pathogenicity. Inoculum was prepared by growing the bacteria on SPA for 48 h and suspending the bacteria in sterile distilled water (SDW) for a final concentration of approximately 10",

    "abstract": "Taking into account the substantial potential of raspberry processing by-products, pomace extracts from two raspberry cultivars, Meeker and Willamette, were investigated. Total phenolic, flavonoid and anthocyanin contents were determined. Willamette pomace extract (EC\u2085\u2080=0.042 mg/ml) demonstrated stronger 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl DPPH radical-scavenging activity than did Meeker pomace extract (EC\u2085\u2080=0.072 mg/ml). The most pronounced cell growth inhibition effect was obtained in the breast adenocarcinoma cell line, reaching EC50 values of 34.8 and 60.3 \u03bcg/ml for Willamette and Meeker extracts, respectively. Both extracts demonstrated favourable non-tumor/tumor cell growth ratios and potently increased the apoptosis/necrosis ratio in breast adenocarcinoma and cervix carcinoma cells. In reference and wild bacterial strains, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were achieved in a concentration range from 0.29 to 0.59 mg/ml, and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) in a range from 0.39 to 0.78 mg/ml. The results indicate significant antioxidant, antiproliferative, proapoptotic and antibacterial activities of raspberry pomace and favour its use as a functional food ingredient.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we evaluated inhibitory potentials of popularly-consumed berries (bilberry, blueberry, cranberry, elderberry, and raspberry ketones) as herbal supplements on UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 in vitro. We also investigated the potential herb-drug interaction via UGT1A1 inhibition by blueberry in vivo. We demonstrated that these berries had only weak inhibitory effects on the five UGTs. Bilberry and elderberry had no apparent inhibitions. Blueberry weakly inhibited UGT1A1 with an IC50 value of 62.4\u00b14.40 \u03bcg/mL and a Ki value of 53.1 \u03bcg/mL. Blueberry also weakly inhibited UGT2B7 with an IC50 value of 147\u00b111.1 \u03bcg/mL. In addition, cranberry weakly inhibited UGT1A9 activity (IC50=458\u00b149.7 \u03bcg/mL) and raspberry ketones weakly inhibited UGT2B7 activity (IC50=248\u00b128.2 \u03bcg/mL). Among tested berries, blueberry showed the lowest IC50 value in the inhibition of UGT1A1 in vitro. However, the co-administration of blueberry had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its active metabolite, SN-38, which was mainly eliminated via UGT1A1, in vivo. Our data suggests that these five berries are unlikely to cause clinically significant herb-drug interactions mediated via inhibition of UGT enzymes involved in drug metabolism. These findings should enable an understanding of herb-drug interactions for the safe use of popularly-consumed berries.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation and oxidative stress are the key events in carcinogenetic transformation. Black raspberries (BRB) have been demonstrated to have antioxidant, antiinflammatory and anticancer bioactivities. In this study, a concanavalin A induced hepatitis mouse model is used to examine the effect of BRB extract on hepatic injury. Three BRB extracts, including ethanol/H2O extracts (both anthocyanin-contained fraction and nonanthocyanin-contained fraction) and hexane extract were used. The alterations in hepatic histology, apoptosis, and oxidative stress were observed in the animals pretreated with BRB extracts and then challenged by concanavalin A. Results indicate that ethanol/H2O extracts can inhibit Con A induced liver injury. The hepatic protection by the ethanol/H2O BRB extracts is associated with decreases of lipid peroxidation and NDA oxidative damage. Importantly, the BRB extracts increase manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity but not the CuZnSOD. The preservation of MnSOD by BRB extracts is associated with the protective action in the liver challenged by Con A. Ethanol/H2O BRB extracts function as antioxidants, thus demonstrating the critical role of oxidative stress in the Con A induced liver injury, and providing evidence that the protective effects of ethanol/H2O BRB extracts result, at least in part, from their antioxidant action.",

    "abstract": "A series of raspberry-shaped composite microgels were synthesized by the seeded emulsion polymerization of styrene with hydrogel particles. Thermoresponsive microgels of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) cross-linked with N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) acted as cores for the polymerization. During the surfactant-free polymerization, the core microgels shrank at 70 \u00b0C to provide thermoresponsive composite microgels, and the polystyrene particles attached to core microgels became bigger with increasing styrene concentration. Conversely, composite microgels synthesized with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) ([SDS] > 6.5 mM) did not exhibit thermoresponsive deswelling behavior because polystyrene particles covered the core microgels. In particular, polystyrene particles formed composites on the microgel surface as well as inside the microgels when the SDS concentration exceeded a critical value for core microgel swelling at 70 \u00b0C. A mechanism is proposed based on these results for the seeded emulsion polymerization of water-immiscible monomers with microgels.",

    "abstract": "A novel robust hybrid raspberry-like TiO2/PS hollow particles with complex double-shelled structures have been fabricated in large quantities by a facile swelling polymerization approach based on commercially available hollow polystyrene (PS) spheres. The crosslinked-PS protrusions are wedged firmly into the TiO2 shell, making the resultant particles both chemically and mechanically robust. By simply tuning the monomer concentration, the hierarchical morphology (the size and number of protrusion) of the surfaces can be well-controlled. Due to the dual-sized hierarchical morphology, the particulate coating possesses superhydrophobicity (water contact angle \u2248 161\u00b0). Moreover, the well-compartmentalized character is similar to that of typical Janus particles. The special particles with interfacial activity can stabilize water-in-toluene (w/o) emulsions well. Meanwhile, a TiO2 double-shelled hollow sphere with a complex structure is achieved by calcination or solvent treatment. All these unique features derived from a readily available method will endow the products with a broader range of applications.",

    "abstract": "Colour and chemical composition of fruits of 10 red raspberry genotypes grown in Nordic climate during three harvest seasons were studied. The main phenolic compounds in the fruits were ellagitannins and anthocyanins, contributing 57% and 42% to the quantified phenolic compounds, respectively. Cyanidin-3-sophoroside was the most abundant anthocyanin (61%). All quality parameters were significantly affected by genotype. The genotypes could be categorised into three groups. 'Veten' and 'RU984 06038' were characterised by high concentrations of flavonoids, i.e., anthocyanins and quercetin glycosides, and dark red colour. 'Octavia', 'Glen Magna', 'RU004 03067', 'Glen Ample' and 'RU974 07002' were characterised by light colour, high titratable acids and low flavonoid concentrations. 'Malling Hestia', 'RU024 01003' and 'RU004 04095' had high content of dry matter, soluble solids, ascorbic acid and ellagic acid containing compounds, in addition to high hue and chroma values. All quality parameters, except ascorbic acid and lambertianin C, varied significantly between harvest seasons. The lowest seasonal variation in fruit quality was observed in 'RU024 01003' and 'Glen Ample' and the highest 'RU004 03067' and 'Glen Magna'.",

All consumer available black raspberry products (n\u2009=\u200919), packaged as dietary supplements or otherwise prepared (freeze-dried whole and pre-ground powders), were purchased and analyzed for their anthocyanin composition and concentration. Seven of the 19 samples contained no anthocyanins from black raspberry fruit, while three of those seven (without black raspberry fruit) had no anthocyanins of any kind. There was a wide range of anthocyanin concentration within the remaining products (18.1-2,904.8\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g; n\u2009=\u200912).

To better understand the biology of the aphid, we estimated the lower developmental threshold and studied the seasonal activity of A. agathonica in commercial fields in northern Washington state. In addition, we monitored the spread of raspberry viruses (raspberry latent virus and raspberry leaf mottle virus, RLMV) to determine how rapidly fields became infected and whether there was a relationship between aphid presence and infection. The lower developmental threshold of A. agathonica was estimated to be 2.7\u00b0C. In the field, apterous and alate aphid populations began rapidly increasing at \u224d800 growing degree-days and peaked at 1,050 growing degree-days. RLMV spread rapidly, with 30-60% of plants in four different commercial fields testing positive after three growing seasons. There was no discernible relationship between the presence or abundance of aphids based on 10 leaves sampled per plant location, and the odds of that plant becoming infected with RLMV.",

    "abstract": "Black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) has been known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects. However, short-term effects of black raspberry on lipid profiles and vascular endothelial function have not been investigated in patients with metabolic syndrome. Patients with metabolic syndrome (n\u2009=\u200977) were prospectively randomized into a group with black raspberry (n\u2009=\u200939, 750\u2009mg/day) and a placebo group (n\u2009=\u200938) during a 12-week follow-up. Lipid profiles, brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (baFMD), and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, C-reactive protein, adiponectin, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 were measured at the baseline and at the 12-week follow-up. Decreases from the baseline in the total cholesterol level (-22.8\u2009\u00b1\u200930.4\u2009mg/dL vs. -1.9\u2009\u00b1\u200931.8\u2009mg/dL, p\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively) and total cholesterol/HDL ratio (-0.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.64 vs. 0.07\u2009\u00b1\u20090.58, p\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively) were significantly greater in the group with black raspberry than in the placebo group. Increases in baFMD at the 12-week follow-up were significantly greater in the group with black raspberry than in the placebo group (0.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.44\u2009mm vs. 0.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.35\u2009mm, p\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively).

    "abstract": "The mechanism of action of polyphenolic compounds is attributed to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative properties and their effects on subcellular signal transduction, cell cycle impairment and apoptosis. A raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) fruit extract contains various antioxidant active compounds, particularly ellagic acid (EA); however the exact intracellular mechanism of their action is not fully understood. The aim of the study was to evaluate the antioxidant effect of raspberry extracts, and that of ellagic acid by assessment of the production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) by murine macrophage J774 cells. Raspberry extracts and their active compound EA did not affect or had very minor effects on cell viability. No significant difference in the ROS generation in arachidonic acid stimulated macrophages was determined for raspberry extracts and EA whereas in the phorbol-12 myristate-13 acetate model ROS generation was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced. Our observation that raspberry pomace extracts in vitro reduce ROS production in a J774 macrophage culture suggests that raspberry extract and ellagic acid mediated antioxidant effects may be due to the regulation of NADPH oxidase activity.",

    "abstract": "Composite particles with varying morphologies composed of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and polymers were fabricated based on a combination of electrostatic interactions between the polymer particles and Au NPs and diffusion processes. The positively charged polymer particles were prepared from amino-terminated polystyrene (PS-NH2) and amino-terminated 1,2-polybutadiene (PB-NH2). Adsorption of citrate-stabilized Au NPs resulted in three different distribution states of Au NPs in the polymer particles, depending on the glass transition temperature (Tg) and molecular weight of the polymer. The adsorption of Au NPs onto PS-NH2 particles produced raspberry-like composite particle morphologies, while the NPs instead diffused into the PB-NH2 particles, since the Tg of PB-NH2 is below room temperature. The diffusion of Au NPs could be controlled by varying the molecular weight of the PB-NH2 and the diameter of the NPs, and both core-shell and amorphous distributions were successfully achieved.",

Compared with berries and cherries grown in temperate climates, the centesimal composition and physical chemical characteristics found in the Brazilian berries and cherries are in agreement with data from the literature. For the mineral composition, the analyzed fruits presented lower concentrations of P, K, Ca, Mg and Zn and higher levels of Fe. The values found for the bioactive compounds generally fit the ranges reported in the literature with minor differences. The greatest difference was found in relation to ascorbic acid, as all fruits analyzed showed levels well above those found in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Torenia fournieri (Torenia) plants were infected with Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) by pollination with RBDV-infected raspberry pollen grains. The infected raspberry pollen grains germinated on Torenia stigmas, and then the pollen tubes penetrated into the stigma, even though the pollen tubes were arrested in the styles. In whole-mount in situ hybridization of germinating infected raspberry pollen grains, RBDV accumulated in the tips of the pollen tubes. Tissue blot hybridization of Torenia plants pollinated with infected raspberry pollen grains revealed that the first virus infection site leading to systemic infection is the stigma. When infected raspberry pollen grains that had lost germination capacity were pollinated on Torenia stigmas, RBDV could not infect the stigmas, and no horizontal transmission occurred. These results indicate that penetration of pollen tubes with accumulated RBDV into stigmas is essential in causing the first viral infection in the stigma to lead to systemic infection.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this research was to develop advanced lipid nanocarriers based on renewable vegetable resources (rice bran oil and raspberry seed oil) that possess self-antioxidative properties, having advantages in terms of minimal side effects and exhibiting the ability to simultaneously co-encapsulate and co-release two active compounds. The focus has been oriented towards developing safe cosmetic formulations with broad-spectrum photoprotection based on these new lipid nanocarriers that contain large amounts of vegetable oils and low concentrations of synthetic UVA and UVB filters (butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane - BMDBM and octocrylene - OCT). The lipid nanocarriers have a spherical shape and show good physical stability, with a zeta potential in the range of -25.5 to -32.4 mV. Both vegetable oils play a key role in the preparation of efficient nanocarriers, leading to a less ordered arrangement of the lipid core that offers many spaces for the entrapment of large amounts of BMDBM (79%) and OCT (90%), as wells as improved antioxidant activity and UV absorption properties, particularly for the lipid nanocarriers prepared from rice bran oil. By formulating the lipid nanocarriers into creams containing only 3.5% of the UV filters and 10.5% of the vegetable oils, the resulting sunscreens exhibited improved photoprotection, reflecting up to 91% and 93% of UVA and UVB rays, respectively. A new direction of research achieved by this study is the multiple release strategy of both UV filters from the same lipid nanocarrier. After 24 hours, a slow release of BMDBM (less than 4%) and OCT (17.5%) was obtained through a Fick diffusion process. This study demonstrates a significant advance in the areas of both nanotechnology and cosmetics, developing safer cosmetic formulations that possess broad antioxidant, photoprotective and co-release effectiveness due to the existence of a high content of nanostructured vegetable oils combined with a low amount of synthetic UV filters in the same carrier system.",

    "abstract": "Black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis L.) (BR) fruit extracts with differing compound profiles have shown variable antiproliferative activities against HT-29 colon cancer cell lines. This study used partial least-squares (PLS) regression analysis to develop a high-resolution (1)H NMR-based multivariate statistical model for discerning the biological activity of BR constituents. This model identified specific bioactive compounds and ascertained their relative contribution against cancer cell proliferation. Cyanidin 3-rutinoside and cyanidin 3-xylosylrutinoside were the predominant contributors to the extract bioactivity, but salicylic acid derivatives (e.g., salicylic acid glucosyl ester), quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 3-rutinoside, p-coumaric acid, epicatechin, methyl ellagic acid derivatives (e.g., methyl ellagic acetyl pentose), and citric acid derivatives also contributed significantly to the antiproliferative activity of the berry extracts. This approach enabled the identification of new bioactive components in BR fruits and demonstrates the utility of the method for assessing chemopreventive compounds in foods and food products.",

    "abstract": "The Korean black raspberry (Rubus coreanus Miquel, KB) on ripening is usually consumed as fresh fruit, whereas the unripe KB has been widely used as a source of traditional herbal medicine. Such a stage specific utilization of KB has been assumed due to the changing metabolite profile during fruit ripening process, but so far molecular and biochemical changes during its fruit maturation are poorly understood. To analyze biochemical changes during fruit ripening process at molecular level, firstly, we have sequenced, assembled, and annotated the transcriptome of KB fruits. Over 4.86 Gb of normalized cDNA prepared from fruits was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq\u2122 2000, and assembled into 43,723 unigenes. Secondly, we have reported that alterations in anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins are the major factors facilitating variations in these stages of fruits. In addition, up-regulation of F3'H1, DFR4 and LDOX1 resulted in the accumulation of cyanidin derivatives during the ripening process of KB, indicating the positive relationship between the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and the anthocyanin accumulation. Furthermore, the ability of RcMCHI2 (R. coreanus Miquel chalcone flavanone isomerase 2) gene to complement Arabidopsis transparent testa 5 mutant supported the feasibility of our transcriptome library to provide the gene resources for improving plant nutrition and pigmentation. Taken together, these datasets obtained from transcriptome library and metabolic profiling would be helpful to define the gene-metabolite relationships in this non-model plant.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry-like (RB) polymer particles were prepared, fluorinated, and cast onto glass plates to yield highly water- and oil-repellant superamphiphobic particulate coatings. To procure the RB particles, glycidyl-bearing 212 and 332 nm particles (abbreviated as s-GMA and l-GMA, respectively) were first prepared via surfactant-free free radical emulsion polymerization. Reacting the glycidyl groups of the l-GMA particles with 2,2'-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) (EDEA) produced large amine-functionalized particles (l-NH2). The l-NH2 particles were then reacted with an excess of the s-GMA particles to create RB particles. For surface fluorination, the residual glycidyl groups of the smaller s-GMA particles surrounding the central l-NH2 core of the RB particles were first converted to amino groups by reaction with EDEA. The purified amino-bearing particles were subsequently reacted with an excess of a statistical copolymer poly(2-(perfluorooctyl)ethyl methacrylate-co-glycidyl methacrylate), P(FOEMA-co-GMA). Casting these particles onto glass plates yielded particulate films that exhibited static contact angles of 165 \u00b1 2\u00b0, 155 \u00b1 3\u00b0, 152 \u00b1 4\u00b0, and 143 \u00b1 1\u00b0 and droplet rolling angles of <1 \u00b0, <1 \u00b0, 7 \u00b1 2\u00b0, and 13 \u00b1 2\u00b0 for water, diiodomethane, corn-based cooking oil, and hexadecane droplets, respectively. These results demonstrated that this practical bottom-up approach could be used to produce superamphiphobic coatings.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 30% higher grade premalignant oral intraepithelial neoplasia (OIN) lesions will progress to oral cancer. Although surgery is the OIN treatment mainstay, many OIN lesions recur, which is highly problematic for both surgeons and patients. This clinical trial assessed the chemopreventive efficacy of a natural product-based bioadhesive gel on OIN lesions.\nThis placebo-controlled multicenter study investigated the effects of topical application of bioadhesive gels that contained either 10% w/w freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB) or an identical formulation devoid of BRB placebo to biopsy-confirmed OIN lesions (0.5 g \u00d7 q.i.d., 12 weeks). Baseline evaluative parameters (size, histologic grade, LOH events) were comparable in the randomly assigned BRB (n = 22) and placebo (n = 18) gel cohorts. Evaluative parameters were: histologic grade, clinical size, and LOH.\nTopical application of the BRB gel to OIN lesions resulted in statistically significant reductions in lesional sizes, histologic grades, and LOH events. In contrast, placebo gel lesions demonstrated a significant increase in lesional size and no significant effects on histologic grade or LOH events. Collectively, these data strongly support BRB's chemopreventive impact. A cohort of very BRB-responsive patients, as demonstrated by high therapeutic efficacy, was identified. Corresponding protein profiling studies, which demonstrated higher pretreatment levels of BRB metabolic and keratinocyte differentiation enzymes in BRB-responsive lesions, reinforce the importance of local metabolism and differentiation competency.\nResults from this trial substantiate the LOH reductions identified in the pilot BRB gel study and extend therapeutic effects to significant improvements in histologic grade and lesional size.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays the trend in analytical chemistry is clearly towards the creation of multiple methods with extended coverage, enabling the determination of many different classes of compounds in a single analysis in which virtually all classes of different compounds are included in a single run. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a versatile and selective GC/MS/MS method for metabolite profiling of volatile compounds in apples, raspberries and grapes. Validation of the method was performed in terms of the limit of detection, limit of quantification, linearity range, and inter and intraday precision. Confirmation of the identity of the compounds in samples was carried out by checking compliance of the q/Q ratio of samples and reference standards. The multiple reaction monitoring with selection of two transition ions, one for quantification and one for confirmation, provided excellent selectivity and sensitivity, using the q/Q ratio as a confirmatory parameter. A multi target method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification and confirmation of 160 volatile compounds of raspberries, apples and grapes. The main classes were esters (42), alcohols (32), monoterpenes (31), aldehydes (17), ketones (12), norisoprenoids (8), acids (8), sesquiterpenes (7), pyrazines (3) and ethers (1) allowing the detection and quantification of 69 compounds in apples, 122 in grapes and 42 in raspberries. Moreover, the method developed can be easily extended to volatile compounds in other fruits and can therefore be widely used for quantification/profiling studies in the field of fruit aroma.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry crumbly fruit in red raspberry (Rubus idaeus), widespread in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and British Columbia, Canada, is most commonly caused by a virus infection. Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) has long been attributed as the causal agent of the disease. Recently, the identification of two additional viruses, Raspberry leaf mottle virus (RLMV) and Raspberry latent virus (RpLV), in northern Washington and British Columbia, suggested the existence of a possible new virus complex responsible for the increased severity of the disease. Virus testing of crumbly fruited plants from five fields in northern Washington revealed the presence of RLMV and RpLV, in addition to RBDV. Plants with less severe crumbly fruit symptoms had a much lower incidence of RLMV or RpLV. Field trials using replicated plots of 'Meeker' plants containing single and mixed infections of RBDV, RLMV, or RpLV, along with a virus-free control, were developed to determine the role of RLMV and RpLV in crumbly fruit. Field evaluations during establishment and two fruiting years revealed that plants infected with the three viruses or the combinations RBDV+RLMV and RBDV+RpLV had the greatest reduction in cane growth, or fruit firmness and fruit weight, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that the titer of RBDV was increased ~400-fold when it occurred in mixed infections with RLMV compared to RBDV in single infections. In addition, a virus survey revealed that RLMV and RpLV are present at high incidence in northern Washington; whereas the incidence in southern Washington and Oregon, where crumbly fruit is not as serious a problem, was considerably lower.",

    "abstract": "In addition to CYP2E1, several CYP isoenzymes, notably CYP1A2, 2D6, and 3A4, are suggested to contribute in acetaminophen oxidation and formation of the hepatotoxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). The in vitro CYP2E1 inhibitory potentials of fennel and raspberry leaf, herbs previously found to inhibit CYP1A2, 2D6, and 3A4 activities in vitro, were investigated. Extracts from commercially available herbal products were incubated with recombinant cDNA-expressed human CYP2E1. A validated LC/MS/MS methodology was applied for determination of 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone formation with disulfiram used as a positive inhibitory control. CYP2E1 IC50 inhibition constants were found to be 23 \u00b1 4 and 27 \u00b1 5 \u00b5g/ml for fennel and raspberry leaf, respectively, constants significantly lower than those presented in the literature for other herbal extracts. Together with previous findings, the presented in vitro data for CYP2E1 inhibition suggest that fennel and raspberry leaf have a significant potential of inhibiting all the major metabolic pathways for acetaminophen oxidation and NAPQI formation. Both herbs should be further investigated for their in vivo ability of inhibiting acetaminophen oxidation and NAPQI formation.",

    "abstract": "Study the shelf-life quality changes in raspberry juice with encapsulated lactobacilli (Lactobacillus rhamnosus NRRL B-4495 and Lactobacillus acidophilus NRRL B-442) obtained by spray drying and understand the various factors involved.\nRaspberry powder was obtained from spray drying lactobacilli and raspberry juice with maltodextrin as an additive. Shelf life of the powder was analyzed over a period of 30\u2009d. Acid and bile tolerance and antibiotic resistance was compared before and after spray drying. Water activity, survival, and scanning electron microscope images were also measured during the shelf life.\nA combination of processing conditions: inlet temperature (\u00b0C), maltodextrin to juice solids ratio and inlet feed rate (ml/min) during spray drying had a significant role on the survival of lactobacilli during shelf life. Refrigerated storage provided a higher shelf-life stability with regards to CFU/g (as high as 84% on day 0 and 98% retention by the end of 30\u2009d) compared to room temperature storage. Probiotic properties during shelf life are affected by the processing conditions and encapsulated food matrix. Thus, understanding these aspects in vitro during shelf life gives us a brief insight into the future of non-dairy probiotics.",

    "abstract": "The decrease in the bone mass associated with osteoporosis caused by ovariectomy, aging, and other conditions is accompanied by an increase in bone marrow adipose tissue. The balance between osteoblasts and adipocytes is influenced by a reciprocal relationship. The development of modalities to promote local/systemic bone formation by inhibiting bone marrow adipose tissue is important in the treatment of fractures or metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis. In this study, we examined whether raspberry ketone [4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)butan-2-one; RK], which is one of the major aromatic compounds of red raspberry and exhibits anti-obesity action, could promote osteoblast differentiation in C3H10T1/2 stem cells. Confluent C3H10T1/2 stem cells were treated for 6 days with 10-100 \u03bcg/mL of RK in culture medium containing 10\u2009nM all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) or 300\u2009ng/mL recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP)-2 protein as an osteoblast-differentiating agent. RK in the presence of ATRA increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in a dose-dependent manner. RK in the presence of rhBMP-2 also increased ALP activity. RK in the presence of ATRA also increased the levels of mRNAs of osteocalcin, \u03b11(I) collagen, and TGF-\u03b2s (TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, and TGF-\u03b23) compared with ATRA only. RK promoted the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 stem cells into osteoblasts. However, RK did not affect the inhibition of early-stage adipocyte differentiation. Our results suggest that RK enhances the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 stem cells into osteoblasts, and it may promote bone formation by an action unrelated to adipocyte differentiation.",

The field trial was carried out in the period of one month starting from the first fruit picking. The results obtained indicated that residue levels on the day of the first crop picking did not even approximate the corresponding EU-MRLs (http://ec.europa.eu/sanco_pesticides). Individual substances in raspberry fruits and leaves disappeared at a similar rate. As a result of chlorpyrifos application to the soil, its residue in fruits and leaves occurred for the whole period of fruit bearing, though in fruit they dropped successively. To produce raspberries with residues below or equal to 0.01 \u03bcg g(-1), the application of pesticides should be stopped at least 2-3 weeks before the first crop picking, and on condition that an appropriate preparation (active in low doses) is applied to the last treatments.",

    "abstract": "There is currently substantial interest in dynamic telecytology-the presentation of microscopic findings by live video feed to a cytopathologist at a remote location. However, the initial costs of a telecytology system can be high. We present several low-cost alternatives along with their performance characteristics.\nWe tested 3 low-cost telecytology systems: a Raspberry Pi with a webcam, an iPhone 4S with FaceTime, and an iPhone 4S with a live streaming app. Costs, resolution capacities, and latency periods for image transmission were determined.\nAt $85.55, the Raspberry Pi system is the least expensive telecytology solution described to date. When the cost per megapixel of resolution is considered, the cost of a Raspberry Pi system is 120\u00d7 less than the most expensive commercially available option and about 7-fold less than the iPhone-based alternatives. Latency periods were substantially lower for the iPhone systems: 2.5 \u00b1 1 seconds for FaceTime and 2.8 \u00b1 0.3 seconds for iPhone live streaming versus 6.6 \u00b1 0.6 seconds for the Raspberry Pi system at comparable frame rates.\nThis proof-of-principle study demonstrates that inexpensive telecytology systems are able to stream live video feeds of cytology slides from a microscope to a remote location at useable resolutions.",

    "abstract": "Our team is designing and fully characterizing black raspberry (BRB) food products suitable for long-term cancer prevention studies. The processing, scale-up, and storage effects on the consistency, quality, bioactive stability, and sensory acceptability of two BRB delivery systems of various matrices are presented. BRB dosage, pH, water activity, and texture were consistent in the scale-up production. Confections retained >90% of anthocyanins and ellagitannin after processing. Nectars had >69% of anthocyanins and >66% of ellagitannin retention, which varied with BRB dosage due to the processing difference. Texture remained unchanged during storage. BRB products consumed in a prostate cancer clinical trial were well accepted in sensory tests. Thus, this study demonstrates that two different BRB foods can be formulated to meet quality standards with a consistent bioactive pattern and successfully scaled up for a large human clinical trial focusing on cancer risk and other health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "A raspberry shaped silica-gold nanoparticle system has been coated with a cuprous oxide shell using a simple wet chemical approach. The optical properties of such particles depend on thin dielectric shell material, and we calculate far-field scattering and extinction of cuprous oxide coated silica-gold composite. In accordance with our theoretical findings, for ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (AuNPs < 5 nm) attached over silica, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak is completely suppressed after Cu2O coating. The cloaking (nonobservability) of the LSPR peak in extinction spectra has been explained via calculation of contribution from absorbance (<10%) and scattering (>90%) in the composite nanostructure. For larger particles (>5 nm), the traditional red-shift of the plasmon peak (from 532 to 588 nm) is still significant due to the large dielectric constant (approx. 8.0 @ 600 nm) of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) coating. A complete and controlled suppression of LSPR in small sized gold nanoparticles due to high dielectric refractory oxide shell could play a significant role in plasmon derived applications.",

Hippuric, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acids were excreted in greatest quantity in the urine over a 24 h period in all diets. Primary PA excreted in the berry diets were 4-hydroxycinnamic acid for CB; chlorogenic, ferulic, and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acids for BB; and 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic, 3-hydroxybenzoic, and 3-hydroxycinnamic acids for BRB. PA were present in conjugated form with cinnamic acid derivatives being 50-70% and phenylacetic acid derivatives conjugated <10%.

    "abstract": "Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is ideally suited for probing and mapping surface species and incipient phases on fuel cell electrodes because of its high sensitivity and surface-selectivity, potentially offering insights into the mechanisms of chemical and energy transformation processes. In particular, bimetal nanostructures of coinage metals (Au, Ag, and Cu) have attracted much attention as SERS-active agents due to their distinctive electromagnetic field enhancements originated from surface plasmon resonance. Here we report excellent SERS-active, raspberry-like nanostructures composed of a silver (Ag) nanoparticle core decorated with smaller copper (Cu) nanoparticles, which displayed enhanced and broadened UV-Vis absorption spectra. These unique Ag@Cu raspberry nanostructures enable us to use blue, green, and red light as the excitation laser source for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with a large enhancement factor (EF). A highly reliable SERS effect was demonstrated using Rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules and a thin film of gadolinium doped ceria.",

    "abstract": "Rapeseed, strawberry and raspberry seed oils are a rich source of polyunsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants such as tocols, bioflavonoids and phytosterols. The aim of the study was to determine changes in the blood lipid profile of rats fed with rapeseed, strawberry and raspberry seed oils and their effects on selected parameters of oxidative status. The experiment was carried out on male Wistar rats. The oils were administered by oral gavage for 5 weeks once daily at the dose of about 0.8 ml per rat. Blood samples were taken before and after supplementation period. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (cGPx) was assessed in erythrocytes and contents of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol, low-density fraction of cholesterol (LDL) and high-density fraction of cholesterol (HDL) were assessed in plasma. The experiment shows that oils supplemented in the diet for 5 weeks had no significant effect on the level of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol as well as HDL and LDL fractions. Reduced activity of cGPX and SOD in the group of rats receiving raspberry and strawberry seed oils suggests that these native oils may contribute to oxidative stability (improves antioxidant status). Thus, strawberry and raspberry seed oils can be considered as special biological oils, which constitute potential nutraceuticals reducing oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "A simple and facile approach was developed to fabricate raspberry-like or snowman-like particles via seeded dispersion polymerization by just changing the ratio of second monomer styrene (St) to seeds in which poly(styrene-co-hydrolyzed-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane) [P(St-co-MPS)] latex was used as seeds with hydrolyzed-MPS as a cross-linking agent. The morphologies of final products were confirmed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, the seed part of snowman-like particles showed raspberry-like with adsorbing quantities of PS particles while the other part smooth. The formation mechanism of the raspberry-like particles was also discussed. The superhydrophobic surface with both the static contact angle of 158\u00b0 and high adhesion to water could be achieved by the hydrophobization of the particulate film with octadecyltrimethoxysilane that was formed from the raspberry-like particles decorated by a thin layer of silica nanoparticles. Further, through encapsulating Ag nanoparticles within the surface, the obtained raspberry-like PS/Ag/SiO2 nanocomposite particles exhibited excellent antibacterial property simultaneously.",

The size of the corona particles and the roughness of the raspberry-like particles can be easily controlled by adjusting the amount of styrene (S), glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), and divinylbenzene (DVB).

    "abstract": "Anthocyanins (Acys), polyphenols, and antioxidants were extracted from raspberry (Rubus Coreanus Miq.) using a highly efficient microwave-assisted extraction technique. Different solvents, including methanol, ethanol, and acetone, were tested. The colors of the extracts varied from light yellow to purple red or dark red. SEM and other nutrient analyses verified that ethanol was the most favorable medium for the microwave-assisted extraction of raspberry due to its high output and low toxicity. Effects of process parameters, including microwave power, irradiation time, and solvent concentration, were investigated through response surface methodology. Canonical analysis estimated that the highest total Acys content, total polyphenols content, and antioxidant activity of raspberry were 17.93 mg cyanidin-3-O-glucoside equivalents per gram dry weight, 38.57 mg gallic acid equivalents per gram dry weight, and 81.24%, respectively. The polyphenol compositions of raspberry extract were identified by HPLC with diode array detection, and nine kinds of polyphenols were identified and quantified, revealing that chlorogenic acid, syringic acid, and rutin are the major polyphenols contained in raspberry fruits. Compared with other fruits and vegetables, raspberry contains higher Acy and polyphenol contents with stronger antioxidant activity, suggesting that raspberry fruits are a good source of natural food colorants and antioxidants.",

    "abstract": "During the past two decades, several viruses have been identified from Rubus spp. in wild and commercial plantings around the world (2). In Ecuador, approximately 14 tons of blackberries are produced each year from an estimated area of 5,500 ha. In 2012, a preliminary survey was conducted to determine the presence of RNA viruses in Rubus glaucus, the most prevalent blackberry in Ecuador. Fifteen plants showing leaf mottling and severe mosaic were leaf-sampled from each of five different fields in Azuay Province. A total of 12 pooled samples of 20 g were obtained from the collected symptomatic tissue and used for dsRNA extraction using a cellulose-based protocol for detection of RNA viruses in plants (3). Three dsRNA segments of approximately 5 kbp, 2 kbp, and 900 bp were observed from all 12 dsRNA preparations. The dsRNA was heat-denatured and used as template for the generation of cDNA library using the universal random primer 5'-GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGAATTCNNNNNN-3', for reverse transcription (RT), and the anchor primer 5'-GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGAATTC-3'for PCR as described (1). The PCR products were cloned using a StrataClone Kit (Agilent, CA) and sequenced (Macrogen, Korea). Sequence analysis revealed the presence of Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV), a pollen-borne Idaeovirus naturally found in several Rubus spp. worldwide. Approximately 120 RBDV sequences obtained from the Ecuadorean isolate were assembled into two contigs belonging to RNA1 and RNA2. Both sequences were re-confirmed by RT-PCR using specific primers. Partial sequences were assigned GenBank Accessions KC315894, KC315893, and KC315892 for the replicase, MP and CP, respectively. Furthermore, BLAST searches showed that the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the replicase was 95% similar to an isolate from the resistance breaking R15 strain (S51557.1), whereas the MP and CP nucleotide sequences were up to 98% similar to a Slovenian isolate (EU796088.1). Primers designed to amplify a 427-bp portion of the CP were used to detect RBDV from four blackberry plantings in two distant production areas: Ambato in Tungurahua Province and Paute in Azuay Province. Leaf mottling and severe mosaic was observed in 90% of blackberry fields in those two locations. Leaf samples (n = 90) were randomly collected from both symptomatic and asymptomatic plants in each location. In Ambato, RBDV was detected in 50% and 40% of symptomatic and asymptomatic plants, respectively. In Paute, RBDV was present in 70% of symptomatic plants and 29% of asymptomatic plants. The presence of RBDV in asymptomatic plants suggests the virus might not be the sole causal agent of the disorder. Further studies are needed to determine the role of RBDV in the observed symptoms, since virus complexes responsible for increased severity of symptoms have been commonly reported in Rubus spp. (4). R. glaucus is native to the tropical highlands (from Ecuador to Mexico) and differs from blackberries commercially grown in the United States and Europe. Therefore, RBDV-induced symptoms reported in blackberry grown in the United States and Europe may not be extrapolated to the Andes berry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of RBDV from blackberry in Ecuador. References: (1) P. Froussard. Nucleic Acids Res. 20:2900, 1992. (2) R. R. Martin et al.

    "abstract": "Emaravirus is a recently described genus of negative-strand RNA plant viruses. Emaravirus P4 protein localizes to plasmodesmata, suggesting that it could be a viral movement protein (MP). In the current study, we showed that the P4 protein of raspberry leaf blotch emaravirus (RLBV) rescued the cell-to-cell movement of a defective potato virus X (PVX) that had a deletion mutation in the triple gene block 1 movement-associated protein. This demonstrated that RLBV P4 is a functional MP. Sequence analyses revealed that P4 is a distant member of the 30K superfamily of MPs. All MPs of this family contain two highly conserved regions predicted to form \u03b2-strands, namely \u03b21 and \u03b22. We explored by alanine mutagenesis the role of two residues of P4 (Ile106 and Asp127) located in each of these strands. We also made the equivalent substitutions in the 29K MP of tobacco rattle virus, another member of the 30K superfamily. All substitutions abolished the ability to complement PVX movement, except for the I106A substitution in the \u03b21 region of P4. This region has been shown to mediate membrane association of 30K MPs; our results show that it is possible to make non-conservative substitutions of a well-conserved aliphatic residue within \u03b21 without preventing the membrane association or movement function of P4.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the emissions produced during the pre-farm, farm and post-farm phases of the production cycle of raspberries and giant American whortleberries (blueberries) cultivated in one of the best-adapted areas in northern Italy. The pre-farm phase included the greenhouse gas emissions from the production of plants in the nursery and the transportation of the plants to the production farms. The farm phase involved the emissions of greenhouse gases from chemical products, the water used for irrigation, the generation of waste, and the consumption of electricity and other energy. The post-farm phase comprised the transportation of the products to the distribution centre (DC) and their storage in the DC. The use phase is not included in the system, nor is transportation from the supermarket to the home of the final consumer, but the disposal of the packaging is nevertheless taken into account. Indeed, the use of traditional plastic materials during both the field phase (nursery and cultivation) and the post-harvesting phase (packaging) produced the greatest estimated impact.",

    "abstract": "Animals, including humans, engage in many forms of foraging behavior in which resources are collected from the world. This paper examines human foraging in a visual search context. A real-world analog would be berry picking. The selection of individual berries is not the most interesting problem in such a task. Of more interest is when does a forager leave one patch or berry bush for the next one? Marginal Value Theorem (MVT; Charnov, 1976) predicts that observers will leave a patch when the instantaneous yield from that patch drops below the average yield from the entire \"field.\" Experiments 1, 2, 3, and 4 show that MVT gives a good description of human behavior for roughly uniform collections of patches. Experiments 5 and 6 show strong departures from MVT when patch quality varies and when visual information is degraded.",

    "abstract": "Synthesis of nanoparticles with desired size/morphology has enormous importance, especially in the compelling field of nanotechnology. In this case, a novel kind of raspberry-type hybrid nanoparticles was prepared by hybridization of chitosan (CS) with thioethyl pendant ligand (TPL) modified Au nanoparticles (Au-TPL@CS NPs). Such method was based on ionic gelation using sodium tripolyphosphate as a counterion. The blood compatibility of Au-TPL@CS NPs was characterized by coagulation tests, plasma recalcification time, hemolysis assay, morphological changes of red blood cells (RBCs) and complement activation in vitro. The results showed that Au-TPL@CS NPs exhibited good blood compatibility. The possible underlying mechanism was also present. Finally, the direct electron transfer reactivity of the Hemoglobin/Au-TPL@CS NPs/multi-walled carbon nanotubes/glassy carbon electrode was investigated with cyclic voltammetry measurements. The biosensor exhibited a good electrocatalytic activity to the reduction of H2O2. Such new type of Au-TPL@CS NPs provides a promising platform of biological system for early illness detection and treatment in future.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid nanoparticles with complex architectures combine the properties of two distinct materials and integrate them to synergistically provide new characteristics to the assembly. In this work we demonstrate the ability to decorate the surface of a variety of micrometer-sized \"core\" particles with responsive microgels, forming raspberry-like particles. We use a templating technique wherein the microgel coating is applied from a high-volume-fraction colloidal phase, leading to high surface coverage and enhanced colloidal stability of the resultant particles. Concentrated colloidal dispersions enable microgel/core combinations driven by both specific and nonspecific interactions and offer improved coverage relative to dilute heteroaggregation. This approach is versatile and allows both the core material and microgel phase to be altered while still remaining effective. Though the recovered particles are highly diluted, recycling the unincorporated microgels following raspberry-like particle isolation and reforming the packed colloidal assembly allow multiple cycles of particle synthesis, which improves overall yield.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound in the 20-1000 kHz range show unique propagation characteristics in fluid media and possess energy that can break down fruit matrices to facilitate the extraction of valuable bioactive compounds. Red raspberries carry significant amounts of specific antioxidants, including ellagitannins and anthocyanins that are important for human health. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of ultrasound frequencies associated with cavitation (20 kHz) and microstreaming (490 and 986 kHz) on total antioxidant activity (AOA), total phenolics content (TPC), and total monomeric anthocyanin content (ACY) of red raspberry puree prepared from crushed berries. The pureed fruit was subjected to high-intensity (20 kHz) and higher frequency-low intensity (490 and 986 kHz) ultrasound for 30 min. The temperature of treated purees increased to a maximum of 56 \u00b0C with 986 kHz. Sonication at 20 and 490 kHz significantly (p<0.05) affected the AOA, ACY, and TPC of red raspberry puree, while 986 kHz had no significant effect on ACY and AOA (p<0.05). In all cases, ultrasound treatment had significant and positive effect on at least one of the measured parameters up to 30 min. Sonication beyond 10 min (and up to 30 min) using 20 kHz either produced no change or caused a drop in AOA and ACY. However, for 986 and 20 kHz, TPC, increased by 10% and 9.5%, respectively after 30 min (p<0.05) compared to the control. At 20 kHz, AOA and ACY increased by 17.3% and 12.6% after 10 min. It was demonstrated that 20 kHz ultrasound treatment, when limited to 10 min, was the most effective for extraction of bioactive compounds in red raspberry compared to 490 and 986 kHz although the effect could be similar at the higher frequencies if different amplitudes are used.",

    "abstract": "The fruit of the black raspberry (Rubus coreanus Miquel) has been employed in traditional medicine, and recent studies have demonstrated its measureable biological activities. However, the root of the black raspberry has not been studied. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties of the root and unripe fruit polyphenols of the black raspberry. Both polyphenols proved to have anti-inflammatory activity as evidenced by the decreased nitric oxide (NO), cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 , IL-6, and IL-10) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) levels in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. However, root polyphenols showed stronger anti-inflammatory activity than fruit polyphenols. LPS-induced mRNA and protein expressions of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 levels were also decreased, confirming the anti-inflammatory activity. Root polyphenols showed lethal activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and Bacillus anthracis. In contrast, the black raspberry fruit did not demonstrate these properties. These data provide the first demonstration that black raspberry root has potential anti-inflammatory and anti-superbacterial properties that can be exploited as alternatives for use in the food and cosmetic industries and/or as pharmaceuticals.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that oral administration of black raspberry powder decreased promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes in tumors from patients with colorectal cancer. The anthocyanins (ACs) in black raspberries are responsible, at least in part, for their cancer-inhibitory effects. In the present study, we asked if ACs are responsible for the demethylation effects observed in colorectal cancers. Three days of treatment of ACs at 0.5, 5, and 25 \u03bcg/ml suppressed activity and protein expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3B in HCT116, Caco2 and SW480 cells. Promoters of CDKN2A, and SFRP2, SFRP5, and WIF1, upstream of Wnt pathway, were demethylated by ACs. mRNA expression of some of these genes was increased. mRNA expression of \u03b2-catenin and c-Myc, downstream of Wnt pathway, and cell proliferation were decreased; apoptosis was increased. ACs were taken up into HCT116 cells and were differentially localized with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in the same cells visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Although it was reported that DNMT3B is regulated by c-Myc in mouse lymphoma, DNMT3B did not bind with c-Myc in HCT116 cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that ACs are responsible, at least in part, for the demethylation effects of whole black raspberries in colorectal cancers.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the facile preparation of polyaniline (PANI) hollow spheres by using a silane coupling agent, N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl]aniline (PAPTMS), as a precursor. The PANI hollow spheres exhibit tunable shell thickness. PAPTMS was used to prepare aniline-modified silica microparticles, ~550 nm in diameter, by the St\u00f6ber process. PANI-coated silica core-shell microcapsules (SiO(2)@PANI) were subsequently obtained by performing chemically oxidative polymerization of a specific aniline monomer loading in the presence of the core-shell particles. PANI hollow spheres with tunable PANI shell thicknesses were eventually obtained by immersing the as-prepared core-shell particles in 5 wt% HF aqueous solutions to simultaneously remove the silica cores and further dope the PANI shells. The as-prepared core-shell particles and PANI hollow spheres were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and (29)Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies. The surface morphologies of the core-shell particles and PANI hollow spheres were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrical conductivities and optical absorption spectra of the as-prepared core-shell microparticles and the PANI hollow spheres were measured using the standard four-point probe method and ultraviolet-visual (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy, respectively.",

The coverage of L-PS(PAA) by S-PS(PVP) could be controlled by adding PVP homopolymer to the L-PS(PAA) dispersion and by changing the molecular weight of the stabilizers. Moreover, the heterocoagulation of large poly(methyl methacrylate) particles stabilized by PAA (L-PMMA(PAA)) and S-PS(PVP) particles was also accomplished, resulting in the formation of L-PMMA(PAA)-core/S-PS(PVP)-corona raspberry-like composite particles.

    "abstract": "Fruit from Rubus species are highly valued for their flavor and nutritive qualities. Anthocyanin content contributes to these qualities, and although many studies have been conducted to identify and quantify the major anthocyanin compounds from various Rubus species, the genetic control of the accumulation of these complex traits in Rubus is not yet well understood. The identification of the regions of the genome involved in the production of anthocyanins is an important first step in identifying the genes underlying their expression. In this study, ultra and high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC and HPLC) and two newly developed Rubus linkage maps were used to conduct QTL analyses to explore the presence of associations between concentrations of five anthocyanins in fruit and genotype. In total, 27 QTL were identified on the Rubus linkage maps, four of which are associated with molecular markers designed from transcription factors and three of which are associated with molecular markers designed from anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway candidate genes. The results of this study suggest that, while QTL for anthocyanin accumulation have been identified on six of seven Rubus linkage groups (RLG), the QTL on RLG2 and RLG7 may be very important for genetic control of cyanidin modification in Rubus.",

    "abstract": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods are often used to identify the parasitic protozoa Cryptosporidium parvum and Cyclospora cayetanensis in foods although little has been published regarding the efficacy of available DNA extraction methods. This study reviewed three commonly used commercial DNA extraction kits: FastDNA SPIN Kit for soil, QBiogene (FastDNA), UltraClean\u2122 Soil DNA Isolation Kit, MO BIO Laboratories (MoBio), and QIAamp DNA Mini Stool Kit, Qiagen (QIAamp), as well as a 'homebrew' Universal Nucleic Acid Extraction (UNEX) method. Washes from raspberry and basil as well as commercial pesto samples were seeded with 5000, 500, or 50 C. parvum and C. cayetanensis oocysts. The protocols were assessed for: quantity and quality of the extracted DNA, time to completion, presence of PCR inhibitors and the percentage of samples correctly identified as positive for the two parasites. Real-time and conventional nested PCR assays were used to detect the seeded pathogens. Of the commercial kits, PCR results of samples extracted using FastDNA were statistically similar to QIAamp and both were superior to MoBio. Differences in PCR results among FastDNA, QIAamp and UNEX for detection of Cyclospora were not statistically significant although the UNEX method proved best with Cryptosporidium. Real-time PCR assays targeted the 18S rRNA and the hsp70 genes of C. cayetanensis; overall results were similar to those found using conventional nested PCR targeting the 18S rRNA gene.",

Pre-emulsified monomer was first prepared followed by polymerizing monomers using semi-batch emulsion polymerization. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and (1)H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) were used to determine the chemical structure and to indentify the related functional group. Grafting and cross-linking of poly(acrylamide-co-acrilic acid)-grafted-poly(styrene-co-methyl methacrylate) [poly(AAm-co-AAc)-g-poly(St-co-MMA)] microgels are approved by the disappearance of band at 1300 cm(-1), 1200 cm(-1) and 1163 cm(-1) of FTIR spectrum and the appearance of CH peaks at 5.5-5.7 ppm in (1)H NMR spectrum. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images indicated that poly(St-co-MMA) particle was lobed morphology coated by cross-linked poly(AAm-co-AAc) shell. Furthermore, SEM results revealed that poly(AAm-co-AAc)-g-poly(St-co-MMA) is composite particle that consist of \"raspberry\"-shape like structure core. Internal structures of the microgels showed homogeneous network of pores, an extensive interconnection among pores, thicker pore walls, and open network structures.
