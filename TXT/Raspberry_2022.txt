    "abstract": "Obesity is recognized as a chronic low-grade inflammation associated with intestinal flora imbalance, leading to dyslipidemia and inflammation. Modern research has found that polyphenols have anti-obesity effects. However, the mechanism of action of raspberry leaf extract (RLE) with high polyphenols in regulating obesity is still unknown. This study investigated the improvement effect of supplementing RLE on high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity in mice.\nRLE was used to intervene in HFD induced C57BL/6J male mice during prevention stage (1-16 weeks) and treatment stage (17-20 weeks). Their weight changes and obesity-related biochemical indicators were measured. The changes in intestinal flora were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing, and finally the targets and pathways of the 7 typical polyphenols (quercetin-3-O-glucuronide, ellagic acid, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, chlorogenic acid, brevifolin carboxylic acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, and quercetin) of RLE in the regulation of obesity were predicted by network pharmacology approach.\nThe results showed that RLE effectively prevented and treated weight gain in obese mice induced by HFD, alleviated adipocyte hypertrophy, reduced Interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha levels, and improved intestinal flora, especially \nThe potential mechanism by which polyphenol-rich RLE regulates obesity may be attributed to the specific polyphenols of RLE and their synergistic effects, therefore RLE has a great anti-obesity potential and may be used as a means to alleviate obesity and related diseases.",

These syndromes can lead to an increased risk of infection and may transform into acute myeloid leukemia, making it critical to determine effective treatments for the condition. While hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine and decitabine, as well as stem cell transplants, have been delineated as favored treatments for MDS, not all patients are physiologically receptive to these treatments. However, black raspberries (BRBs) have been shown to exert hypomethylating effects in various malignancies, with minimal adverse effects and thus a broader range of potential candidacies.

    "abstract": "Rosaceae is a large plant family consisting of many economically important fruit crops including peach, apple, pear, strawberry, raspberry, plum, and others. Investigations into their growth and development will promote both basic understanding and progress toward increasing fruit yield and quality. With the ever-increasing high-throughput sequencing data of Rosaceae, comparative studies are hindered by inconsistency of sample collection with regard to tissue, stage, growth conditions, and by vastly different handling of the data. Therefore, databases that enable easy access and effective utilization of directly comparable transcript data are highly desirable. Here, we describe a database for comparative analysis, ROsaceae Fruit Transcriptome database (ROFT), based on RNA-seq data generated from the same laboratory using similarly dissected and staged fruit tissues of four important Rosaceae fruit crops: apple, peach, strawberry, and red raspberry. Hence, the database is unique in allowing easy and robust comparisons among fruit gene expression across the four species. ROFT enables researchers to query orthologous genes and their expression patterns during different fruit developmental stages in the four species, identify tissue-specific and tissue-/stage-specific genes, visualize and compare ortholog expression in different fruit types, explore consensus co-expression networks, and download different data types. The database provides users access to vast amounts of RNA-seq data across the four economically important fruits, enables investigations of fruit type specification and evolution, and facilitates the selection of genes with critical roles in fruit development for further studies.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry plants, valued for their fruits, are vulnerable to a range of viruses that adversely affect their yield and quality. Utilizing high-throughput sequencing (HTS), we identified a novel virus, tentatively named raspberry enamovirus 1 (RaEV1), in three distinct raspberry plants. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of RaEV1, focusing on its genomic structure, phylogeny, and possible transmission routes. Analysis of nearly complete genomes from 14 RaEV1 isolates highlighted regions of variance, particularly marked by indel events. The evidence from phylogenetic and sequence analyses supports the classification of RaEV1 as a distinct species within the ",

    "abstract": "Approximately 650,000 new cases of heart failure (HF) are diagnosed annually with a 50% five-year mortality rate. HF is characterized by reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and hypertrophy of the LV wall. The pathophysiological remodeling of the heart is mediated by increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Raspberries are rich in polyphenols which may favorably impact enzymes involved in redox homeostasis while also targeting inflammatory signaling. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate whether raspberry polyphenols could attenuate HF. Sprague Dawley rats consumed a 10% (w/w) raspberry diet for 7 weeks. At week 3, HF was surgically induced via coronary artery ligation. Hemodynamics and morphology of the heart were assessed. Expression of cardiac proteins involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and remodeling were examined, and histological analysis was conducted. Additionally, human cardiomyocytes were treated with raspberry polyphenol extract (RBPE) followed by CoCl",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop, for the first time, anthocyanin-enriched fractions from black raspberry pomace (BRP) using ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) via sonotrode and the Particles from Gas-Saturated Solutions (PGSS) process. UAEs with different amplitudes and sonication times were evaluated and showed relevant effects on the yields of target analytes. The raspberry pomace extracts were formulated in a powder form by PGSS using glyceryl monostearate as a carrier at different extract-to-carrier ratios of 1:11, 1:5, and 1:3. The effects of all variables were evaluated in terms of extraction yield, total phenolic content, and encapsulation yield. UAE was strongly affected by amplitude, and the highest amplitude (100%) provided the best results for extraction yield and total phenolics. HPLC of UAE extracts and powders was utilized for quantification of polyphenol compounds, showing cyanidin-3-rutinoside as a main compound, followed by cyanidin-3-glucoside, rutin, ellagic acid, and gallic acid. These results show that these time-efficient and high-performance techniques enable the production of natural fractions from industrial BRP with acceptable characteristics to be used for the development of nutraceuticals and different food formulations.",

    "abstract": "The addition of yogurt to fruit smoothies enhances their nutritional value by introducing components not naturally found in fruit products. However, the addition of fermented products can affect the stability of fruit bioactive components in fruits, such as anthocyanins. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of varying yogurt additions (0, 10, 20, and 30%) on the stability of anthocyanins during a 4-week refrigerated storage period. The smoothies were obtained from purees of strawberry, raspberry, and blueberry, combined with apple juice and apple puree. In addition, to elucidate the causes of the observed changes in the smoothies, model studies were conducted using purified anthocyanin extracts obtained from the analyzed fruits. We assessed the effects of pH, hydrogen peroxide concentration, and the addition of cell-free extracts from ",

    "abstract": "An ultrasound-enzyme-assisted extraction (UEAE) was optimized to extract, simultaneously, the hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds from three berry pomaces (raspberry, strawberry and blackberry). First, an enzyme screening designated a thermostable alkaline protease as the most suitable enzyme to recover, in an aqueous medium, the highest yields of polyphenols and oil in the most efficient way. Secondly, the selected enzyme was coupled to ultrasounds (US) in sequential and simultaneous combinations. The simultaneous US-alkaline enzyme combination was selected as a one-single-step process and was then optimized by definitive screening design (DSD). The optimized parameters were: US amplitude, 20% (raspberry pomace) or 70% (strawberry and blackberry pomaces); pH, 8; E/S ratio, 1% (",

    "abstract": "The integration of Raspberry Pi miniature computer systems with microfluidics has revolutionised the development of low-cost and customizable analytical systems in life science laboratories. This review explores the applications of Raspberry Pi in microfluidics, with a focus on imaging, including microscopy and automated image capture. By leveraging the low cost, flexibility and accessibility of Raspberry Pi components, high-resolution imaging and analysis have been achieved in direct mammalian and bacterial cellular imaging and a plethora of image-based biochemical and molecular assays, from immunoassays, through microbial growth, to nucleic acid methods such as real-time-qPCR. The control of image capture permitted by Raspberry Pi hardware can also be combined with onboard image analysis. Open-source hardware offers an opportunity to develop complex laboratory instrumentation systems at a fraction of the cost of commercial equipment and, importantly, offers an opportunity for complete customisation to meet the users' needs. However, these benefits come with a trade-off: challenges remain for those wishing to incorporate open-source hardware equipment in their own work, including requirements for construction and operator skill, the need for good documentation and the availability of rapid prototyping such as 3D printing plus other components. These advances in open-source hardware have the potential to improve the efficiency, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness of microfluidic-based experiments and applications.",

    "abstract": "An electrochemical study of lyophilized blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) and raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) fruits was carried out using microparticulate deposits from ethanolic extracts of fruits in contact with different aqueous electrolytes. This voltammetry is dominated by the oxidation of anthocyanins. It was hypothesized that under conditions of electrochemical generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), new anthocyanin-derived species with high antioxidant capacity are formed over a wide pH range. In the case of ROS-activated anthocyanins, electrochemical oxidation is associated with loss of sugar moieties. Experimental voltammetric and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) imaging data consistent with this hypothesis are presented.",

    "abstract": "Strawberry cultivars Portola and Enduro, as well as raspberry cultivars Enrosadira and Kwazi, were evaluated for their antioxidant potential after treatment with gaseous ozone and different refrigeration storage conditions. Their antioxidant capacity was investigated with ABTS and DPPH methods, and the chemical composition was determined by measuring the total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoid (TFC) compounds. The classification of different samples of berry puree was influenced significantly by both the cultivars and the refrigeration storage method. Moreover, FTIR spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics was used as an alternative technique to conventional methods to determine the chemical composition of strawberries and raspberries. The chemometric discrimination of samples was achieved using principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) modelling procedures performed on the FTIR preprocessed spectral data for the fingerprint region (1800-500 cm",

    "abstract": "Point-of-care testing plays a crucial role in diagnostics within resource-poor areas, necessitating the utilization of portable and user-friendly devices. The adaptation of biosensors for point-of-care applications requires careful considerations, such as miniaturization, cost-effectiveness, and streamlined sample processing. In recent years, the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay has gained significant attention due to its visual detection capabilities and ability to facilitate high-throughput analysis. However, the development of a practical and cost-effective ECL device remains a challenging task. This study presents the development of an integrated MXene-modified single-electrode electrochemical system (SEES) for visual and high-throughput ECL immunoassays incorporating a Raspberry Pi system. The SEES was designed by affixing a plastic sticker with multiple perforations onto a single carbon ink screen-printed electrode, which operates based on a resistance-induced potential difference. Leveraging the excellent adsorption and bioaffinity properties of the carbon ink screen-printed electrode, effective immobilization of antibodies was achieved. Furthermore, the incorporation of Co-Pt nanoparticles enhanced the ECL intensity and electron transfer kinetics, enabling the sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2. The developed system comprised 18 individual reaction cells, allowing for simultaneous analysis while maintaining sample isolation. Impressively, the system achieved a remarkable minimum virus detection limit of 10",

    "abstract": "Raspberries (Rubus spp) are temperate climate fruits with profitable high returns and have the potential for diversification of fruit growing in mid to low-latitude regions. However, there are still no cultivars adapted to climatic conditions and high pressure of diseases that occurs in tropical areas. In this context, our objective was to evaluate the genetic diversity from a 116 raspberry genotypes panel obtained from interspecific crosses in a testcross scheme with four cultivars already introduced in Brazil. The panel was genotyped via genotyping-by-sequencing. 28,373 and 27,281 SNPs were obtained, using the species R. occidentalis and R. idaeus genomes as references, respectively. A third marker dataset was constructed consisting of 41,292 non-coincident markers. Overall, there were no differences in the results when using the different marker sets for the subsequent analyses. The mean heterozygosity was 0.54. The average effective population size was 174, indicating great genetic variability. The other analyses revealed that the half-sibling families were structured in three groups. It is concluded that the studied panel has great potential for breeding and further genetic studies. Moreover, only one of the three marker matrices is sufficient for diversity studies.",

    "abstract": "To improve the utilization value of raspberry leaves, the extraction and purification conditions of phenolic compounds from raspberry leaves were optimized, and the contents of phenolic compounds and the biological activities of extracts were studied. After steam explosion pretreatment at 115 \u00b0C for 15 min, raspberry leaf extract with a total phenolic content (TPC) of 136.30~140.51 mg GAE/g was obtained via homogenization and ultrasound-assisted extraction. In addition, the adsorption relationship between raspberry leaf polyphenols and middle polar XDA-6 macroporous resin was best described by the Langmuir model, and tended to be monolayer adsorption. Its adsorption kinetics best resembled the pseudo second-order kinetic model, and it was speculated that this was influenced by multiple factors. According to the optimal integrated extraction-purification process, the TPC of the extracts increased to 738.98 mg GAE/g after one application of purification and 905.27 mg GAE/g after two applications of purification. Moreover, the latter case showed the highest antioxidant activity and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition activity, and the content of the most typical compound, quercetin-3-glucuronide, reached 199.69 mg/g. SE has a double-edged effect, and is more conducive to the release of active substances as a pre-treatment method. This study provides a theoretical basis for the efficient use of raspberry leaves, further improving their medicinal and economic value.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to clarify the endoscopic and clinicopathological features of raspberry-shaped gastric lesions (RSGLs) and to establish an endoscopic diagnostic algorithm for RSGLs.\nWe collected RSGLs from an endoscopic database at our hospital between May 2009 and August 2021. All RSGLs were histopathologically classified and compared based on their endoscopic and clinicopathological characteristics.\nSixty-five RSGLs in 54 patients were classified into five histopathological types: gastric adenocarcinoma of foveolar type (GA-FV, \nOur diagnostic algorithm for RSGLs constructed using endoscopic features might be useful for the endoscopic differential diagnosis of RSGLs.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone has generated interest in recent years both as a flavor agent and as a health promoting supplement. Raspberry ketone can be synthesized chemically, but the value of a natural nonsynthetic product is among the most valuable flavor compounds on the market. Coumaroyl-coenzyme A (CoA) is the direct precursor for raspberry ketone but also an essential precursor for flavonoid and lignin biosynthesis in plants and therefore highly regulated. The synthetic fusion of 4-coumaric acid ligase (4CL) and benzalacetone synthase (BAS) enables the channeling of coumaroyl-CoA from the ligase to the synthase, proving to be a powerful tool in the production of raspberry ketone in both ",

    "abstract": "In recent years the use of hybrid drying methods has been noticed because of the improvement of the dried products quality. The effect of infrared (IR) power (0, 400, 600, and 800\u00a0W) in combination with convective hot air (60\u00a0\u00b0C, 3\u00a0m/s) on the quality properties of black raspberry pulp during foam mat drying was investigated in this study. According to the findings, increasing the IR power, (IR-CHA) had no effect on the moisture content, moisture ratio, or drying rate of the product; however, the effective moisture diffusion coefficient (D",

    "abstract": "(1) Background: Bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) has gained in popularity over the years due to its outstanding properties such as renewability, biocompatibility, and bioavailability, and its use as an eco-friendly material of the future for replacing petrochemical products. (2) Methods: This research refers to the utilization of lignocellulose coming from wood waste via enzymatic hydrolysis to produce biopolymer BNC with an accumulation rate of 0.09 mg/mL/day. Besides its significant contribution to the sustainability, circularity, and valorization of biomass products, the obtained BNC was functionalized through the adsorption of black raspberry extract (BR) by simple soaking. (3) Results: BR contained 77.25 \u00b1 0.23 mg GAE/g of total phenolics and 27.42 \u00b1 0.32 mg CGE/g of total anthocyanins. The antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of BR was evaluated by DPPH (60.51 \u00b1 0.18 \u00b5g/mL) and FRAP (1.66 \u00b1 0.03 mmol Fe",

    "abstract": "With global climate warming, recurring extreme heat and high temperatures irreversibly damage plants. Raspberries, known for their nutritional and medicinal value, are in high demand worldwide. Thus, it is important to study how high-temperature stress (HTS) affects raspberries. The physiological and biochemical responses and molecular genetic mechanisms of raspberry leaves to different HTS treatments were investigated: mild high temperature at 35\u00b0C (HT35), severe high temperature at 40\u00b0C (HT40), and the control at room temperature of 25\u00b0C (CK). The physiological results suggested that leaves in both the 35\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C treatments showed maximum relative conductivity at 4\u00a0d of stress, increasing by 28.54% and 43.36%, respectively, compared to CK. Throughout the stress period (0-4 d), malondialdehyde (MDA) and soluble protein contents of raspberry leaves increased under HT35 and HT40 treatments, while soluble sugar content first decreased and then increased. Catalase (CAT) activity increased, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity first increased and then decreased, and peroxidase (POD) activity gradually decreased. Photosynthetic and fluorescence responses of raspberry leaves showed the most severe impairment after 4\u00a0d of stress. Transcriptomics results revealed significant alterations in 42 HSP family genes, two SOD-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 25 POD-related DEGs, three CAT-related DEGs, and 38 photosynthesis-related DEGs under HTS. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that these DEGs were mainly enriched in photosynthesis-antenna proteins, pentose and glucuronide interconversion, phenylpropane biosynthesis, and indole alkaloid biosynthesis. HTS induced excessive ROS accumulation in raspberry leaves, causing oxidative damage in plant cells and subsequently reducing photosynthesis in raspberry leaves. This reduction in photosynthesis, in turn, affects photosynthetic carbon fixation and starch and sucrose metabolism, which, combined with phenol propane biosynthesis, mitigates the HTS-induced damage.",

    "abstract": "Despite many efforts devoted toward the design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) at the framework level by selecting the building blocks, their organization in the nano to meso regimes is often neglected. Moreover, the importance of processability for their applications has recently emerged and the synthesis of COF nanostructures without agglomeration is still a challenge. Herein, the first example of hybrid COF-polymer particles for which polymers are used to manipulate the 2D COF growth along a specific direction is reported. The study examines how the nature, chain-end functionality, and molar mass of the polymer influence the shaping of hybrid 2D boronate ester-linked COF-polymer particles. Catechol-poly(N-butyl acrylate) leads to the self-assembly of crystallites into quasi-spherical structures while catechol-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) mediates the synthesis of raspberry-like COF-polymer particles with radial grain orientation. Scanning and transmission electron microscopies (SEM and TEM) and 4D-STEM-ACOM (automated crystal orientation mapping) highlight the single-crystal character of these domains with one plane family throughout the particles. Interestingly, the presence of PNIPAm on the particle surface allows their drying without co-crystallization and enables their resuspension. Kinetic investigations show that catechol-PnBuA acts as a modulator and catechol-PNIPAm induces a template effect, introducing supramolecular self-assembly properties into particles to create new morphologies with higher structural complexity, beyond the framework level.",

    "abstract": "The current study aimed to investigate the effect of orally administered raspberry ketone (RK) on ameliorating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced in rats by high-fat high-fructose diet (HFFD) in comparison to calorie restriction (CR) regimen. Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into two experimental groups; one was fed normal chow diet (NCD, n\u00a0=\u00a06) for 15 weeks to serve as normal control group and the other group was fed HFFD (n\u00a0=\u00a024) for 7 weeks to induce NAFLD. After induction, rats in the HFFD group were randomly allocated into four groups (n\u00a0=\u00a06 rats each). One group continued on HFFD feeding for 8 weeks (NAFLD control group). The remaining 3 groups received NCD, calorie-restricted diet, or NCD along with RK (55\u00a0mg/kg/day, orally) for 8 weeks. Like CR, RK effectively attenuated NAFLD and ameliorated the changes attained by HFFD. RK upregulated the expression of the phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (P-AMPK) and fatty acid oxidation factors; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-\u03b1) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) and downregulated lipogenic factors; sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) in the hepatic tissue. Also, RK improved lipid profile parameters, liver enzymes and both body and liver tissue weights. Altogether, these findings suggest that oral administration of RK, along with normal diet, ameliorated NAFLD in a way similar to CR. This approach could be an alternative to CR in the management of NAFLD, overcoming the poor compliance to long term CR regimen.",

    "abstract": "Male climacteric syndrome (MCS) is a medical condition that can affect middle-aged men whose testosterone levels begin to decline considerably. These symptoms may include fatigue, decreased libido, mood swings, and disturbed sleep. MCS can be managed with lifestyle modifications and testosterone replacement. However, testosterone therapy may cause number of side effects, including an increased risk of cardiovascular issues. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of unripe black raspberry extract (BRE) against MCS and voiding dysfunction in men with andropause symptoms. A total of 30 subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to the BRE group (n = 15) or the placebo group (n = 15). Participants were supplemented with 4800 mg BRE or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. The impact of BRE was assessed using the Aging Male's Symptoms (AMS scale), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the IPSS quality of life index (IPSS-QoL). Additionally, male sex hormones, lipid profiles, and anthropometric indices were assessed 6 and 12 weeks after treatment. The AMS scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. In the BRE group, the total IPSS and IPSS-QoL scores decreased significantly after 12 weeks compared to baseline (",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are neurological disorders that become more prevalent with age, usually caused by damage or loss of neurons or their myelin sheaths, such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important triggers for neurodegenerative disease development, and mitigation of oxidative stress caused by ROS imbalance in the human body is important for the treatment of these diseases. As a widespread delicious fruit, the raspberry is widely used in the field of food and medicine because of its abundant polyphenols and other bioactive substances. Polyphenols from a wide variety of raspberry sources could alleviate neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to summarize the current roles of these polyphenols in maintaining neurological stability by regulating the composition and metabolism of the intestinal flora and the gut-brain axis signal transmission. Especially, we discuss the therapeutic effects on neurodegenerative diseases of raspberry polyphenols through intestinal microorganisms and ROS signals, by means of summary and analysis. Finally, methods of improving the digestibility and utilization of raspberry polyphenols are proposed, which will provide a potential way for raspberry polyphenols to guarantee the health of the human nervous system.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic control of polyphenol accumulation in red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L).\nThe levels of total anthocyanins and 37 individual polyphenol metabolites were measured over three years in a raspberry biparental mapping population. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for these traits were mapped onto a high-density SNP linkage map.\nAt least one QTL was detected for each trait, with good consistency among the years. On four linkage groups (LG), there were major QTLs affecting several metabolites. On LG1, a QTL had large effects on anthocyanins and flavonols containing a rutinoside or rhamnose group. On LG4, a QTL had large effects on several flavonols and on LG5 and LG6 QTLs had large effects on ellagic acid derivatives. Smaller QTLs were found on LG2 and LG3.\nThe identification of robust QTLs for key polyphenols in raspberry provides great potential for marker-assisted breeding for improved levels of potentially health beneficial components.",

    "abstract": "The economical production of small fruits has been significantly complicated by the spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii Matsumura, throughout its invaded rage. Fall-bearing red raspberries are especially susceptible to D. suzukii, and significant efforts to mitigate their damage are undertaken by growers. Exclusion barriers made from fine-mesh netting has emerged as an organic compliant strategy to mitigate damage from D. suzukii. Identifying less susceptible raspberry cultivars may also alleviate D. suzukii damage. Key pollination complications arise from exclusion-based tactics, but properly timing exclusion establishment may provide a remedy. In a 2-yr-old fall-bearing raspberry planting containing 3 cultivars, exclusion barriers were erected at 2 phenological timings. Spinosad- and pyrethrin-based pesticides were also applied to separate rows throughout harvest and a fourth treatment group matured without management. A subsection of raspberries was harvested and examined for marketability or damage, and D. suzukii adult populations were sampled with baited traps. An exclusion barrier applied early in fruit development was the most effective pest management strategy of those we tested. Its use decreased D. suzukii captures by 75%, decreased D. suzukii-infested fruit weights by 48%, and increased marketable yield by 63% compared to the no management control; however, it also increased pollination deficient fruit weights. Exclusion netting applied later in fruit maturation also decreased D. suzukii captures, infested fruit weights, and the weight of fruits damaged by other arthropod pests but did not significantly increase marketable yield. Our results indicate that netting exclusions may hold promise for the economical production of fall-bearing raspberries.",

    "abstract": "In Europe, the green course is becoming increasingly relevant, and there are more and more suggestions for its improvement. The valorization of food waste attracts increasing attention and is one important current research area. The aim of this study was to examine oils from 16 raspberry variety seeds and to compare their yields and fatty acid contents. The next task was to extract oil from the raspberry variety 'Polka' by four different methods and to compare the yield, colors, fatty acids content and composition, and kinematic and dynamic viscosity. The last task was to analyze the economic profitability of oil extraction by different methods. This study demonstrates the potential of different varieties of raspberry by-products and shows the influence of different oil extraction methods on the fatty acid composition of the oil and the economic potential of such products. The analysis revealed that the predominating fatty acid in the raspberry variety 'Polka' seed oil was linoleic acid (44.0-44.8%), followed by \u03b1-linolenic acid (37.9-38.1%) and oleic acid (10.2-10.6%). Of the 16 raspberry cultivars tested, 'Polka' seed oil had the least linoleic (\u03c9-6) (44.79%) and the most \u03b1-linolenic (\u03c9-3) fatty acids and the best ratio of \u03c9-6 to \u03c9-3 fatty acids-1.2:1. Raspberry variety 'Polka' seed oil contains a lot of carotenoids; their total amount depending on the extraction method varies from 0.81 mg/100 g (extracted with subcritical CO",

    "abstract": "Measuring lycopene in tomatoes is fundamental to the agrifood industry because of its health benefits. It is one of the leading quality criteria for consuming this fruit. Traditionally, the amount determination of this carotenoid is performed using the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. This is a very reliable and accurate method, but it has several disadvantages, such as long analysis time, high cost, and destruction of the sample. In this sense, this work proposes a low-cost sensor that correlates the lycopene content in tomato with the color present in its epicarp. A Raspberry Pi 4 programmed with Python language was used to develop the lycopene prediction model. Various regression models were evaluated using neural networks, fuzzy logic, and linear regression. The best model was the fuzzy nonlinear regression as the RGB input, with a correlation of R",

    "abstract": "Previous studies suggested that dietary supplementation with prebiotic fructooligosaccharides (FOSs) and polyphenols could mitigate disorders related to the first stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced by an obesogenic diet. Therefore, this experiment aimed to address whether the health-promoting potential of raspberry polyphenols together with FOSs can regulate advanced-stage NAFLD in Zucker rats genetically predisposed to develop obesity. The addition of FOSs and raspberry polyphenolic extract to the diet reduced liver fat accumulation and triglyceride, free fatty acid, and total cholesterol levels in the liver. The elevated GSH/GSSG ratio and reduced malondialdehyde content indicated that the liver antioxidant potential was considerably increased. The treatment also lowered the plasma aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities and collagen type IV levels. Insulin levels were decreased, but glucose levels remained constant, indicating greater insulin sensitivity. These changes may result from the upregulation of FXR and AHR receptors in the liver, which are responsible for regulating lipid metabolism and glucose and bile acid synthesis. The reduced bile acid levels in the cecal contents confirmed the activation of liver mechanisms. In conclusion, dietary enrichment with FOSs and raspberry polyphenolic extract has sufficient health-promoting potential to regulate liver metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation related to NAFLD development in obese Zucker rats.",

    "abstract": "Sorbets are a popular dessert, especially during hot summer days. They can also have health-promoting qualities, mainly due to the nutritional value of the fruit from which they are made. The production technology can also have an impact on the final nutritional quality of the sorbets. This paper presents a comparative assessment of the quality of industrial fruit sorbets and their craft analogs. Sorbets with the following flavors were selected for the research: blueberry, strawberry, raspberry, and passion fruit with mango. An organoleptic evaluation was performed, and the overrun, melting resistance, active acidity (pH), color in the CIE Lab system, antiradical activity (DDPH method), and content of vitamin C and total polyphenols were determined. The research revealed the differences between sorbets produced from different fruits as well as the differences depending on the production method between products made of the same type of fruit. Craft sorbets were found to be better than industrial sorbets, and storage time had a significant effect on the sorbets' quality. In terms of organoleptic characteristics, craft mango-passion fruit sorbet turned out to be the best; in terms of antioxidant properties, craft raspberry and strawberry sorbets were the best, and these two sorbets also showed good, stable overrun and melting resistance values during storage.",

    "abstract": "Queensland fruit fly (Qfly) males exhibit accelerated sexual maturation when their diet is supplemented with raspberry ketone (RK) for 48\u2009h following emergence, which is beneficial for sterile insect technique operation. The present study tests whether RK supplementation makes Qfly more vulnerable to starvation or desiccation.\nFlies were fed for 48\u2009h with a yeast hydrolysate and sugar diet (1:3) that contained 0% RK (control), 1.25% RK (low dose) or 5% RK (high dose) to test subsequent vulnerability to starvation and desiccation. RK feeding decreased body weight and water content in males and increased lipid levels in both sexes before exposure to any stress treatment. Under nutritional stress, flies fed the low RK dose, but not the high RK dose, had higher survival than controls. Under desiccation stress, flies fed both the low and high RK doses had lower survival than the controls. Body weight, water content and lipid reserves at death were all affected by RK dose when under nutritional stress, but not when under desiccation stress. In the absence of stress, body weight at death was higher than controls in flies provided with the high RK dose and lipids were lower than controls in flies provided with the low RK dose.\nFeeding with RK makes Qflies more vulnerable to desiccation but not starvation. In most conditions, it is expected that the disadvantage of increased desiccation vulnerability would be outweighed by the benefits of accelerated sexual maturation in RK-fed young adult Qflies. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Repairing potholes is a task for municipalities to prevent serious road user injuries and vehicle damage. This study presents a low-cost, high-performance pothole monitoring system to maintain urban roads. The authors developed a methodology based on photogrammetry techniques to predict the pothole's shape and volume. A collection of overlapping 2D images shot by a Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B has been used to create a pothole 3D model. The Raspberry-based configuration has been mounted on an autonomous and remote-controlled robot (developed in the InfraROB European project) to reduce workers' exposure to live traffic in survey activities and automate the process. The outputs of photogrammetry processing software have been validated through laboratory tests set as ground truth; the trial has been conducted on a tile made of asphalt mixture, reproducing a real pothole. Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) technologies allowed visualising potholes on a map with information about their centre, volume, backfill material, and an associated image. Ten on-site tests validated that the system works in an uncontrolled environment and not only in the laboratory. The results showed that the system is a valuable tool for monitoring road potholes taking into account construction workers' and road users' health and safety.",

    "abstract": "Belonging to Rosaceae, red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) and wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca) are closely related species with distinct fruit types. While the numerous ovaries become the juicy drupelet fruits in raspberry, their strawberry counterparts become dry and tasteless achenes. In contrast, while the strawberry receptacle, the stem tip, enlarges to become a red fruit, the raspberry receptacle shrinks and dries. The distinct fruit-forming ability of homologous organs in these 2 species allows us to investigate fruit type determination. We assembled and annotated the genome of red raspberry (R. idaeus) and characterized its fruit development morphologically and physiologically. Subsequently, transcriptomes of dissected and staged raspberry fruit tissues were compared to those of strawberry from a prior study. Class B MADS box gene expression was negatively associated with fruit-forming ability, which suggested a conserved inhibitory role of class B heterodimers, PISTILLATA/TM6 or PISTILLATA/APETALA3, for fruit formation. Additionally, the inability of strawberry ovaries to develop into fruit flesh was associated with highly expressed lignification genes and extensive lignification of the ovary pericarp. Finally, coexpressed gene clusters preferentially expressed in the dry strawberry achenes were enriched in \"cell wall biosynthesis\" and \"ABA signaling,\" while coexpressed clusters preferentially expressed in the fleshy raspberry drupelets were enriched in \"protein translation.\" Our work provides extensive genomic resources as well as several potential mechanisms underlying fruit type specification. These findings provide the framework for understanding the evolution of different fruit types, a defining feature of angiosperms.",

    "abstract": "Understanding soil bacterial diversity under nitrogen reduction is necessary for the crucial role in soil nitrogen cycling. However, the effects of combined fertilization on soil chemical properties, microbial community structure, and yield are unknown. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of nitrogen fertilizer reduction with bio-organic fertilizer on soil bacterial community diversity of red raspberry orchard. Six treatments were set in this study: NF-100%, NF-75%, NF-50%, NF-25% and CF, no nitrogen fertilizer and bio-organic fertilizer for CK. The bacterial community structures of soil were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplification high-throughput sequencing technology. Nitrogen fertilizer reduction with bio-organic fertilizer increased soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), and reduced soil pH. NF-50% and NF-25% treatments increased the yield of red raspberry. Nitrogen reduction combined with bio-organic fertilizer increased the relative abundance of copiotrophic bacteria and decreased the relative abundance of oligotrophic bacteria. The increase in copiotrophic bacteria in the soil of red raspberry orchard could indicate an increase in soil nutrient availability, which have positive implications for soil fertility and production. However, nitrogen fertilizer reduction with bio-organic fertilizer altered the abundance and diversity of soil bacteria, which was reduced compared to CF treatments. The PCoA analysis of the soil bacterial community showed that the community structure of NF-25% treatment was more different from other treatments, indicating that the fertilization method changed the community structure of soil bacteria. The results of a redundancy analysis showed that SOM, pH, AN, TN, and AP were the main factors affecting the microbial community structure. Overall, the reduction of nitrogen fertilizer with bio-organic fertilizer significantly increased the soil nutrient content, reduced the relative abundance and diversity of soil bacteria, increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria in the soil, changed the bacterial community structure of soil, increased production and created suitable soil conditions for the red raspberry growth.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberry is a kind of fruit with high nutritional values. To evaluate the comprehensive quality of 24 red raspberry varieties in Northeast China, physicochemical properties, bioactive compounds and sensory characteristics were measured, followed by principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA). Altogether, eight important property indexes for processing attributes were selected out using PCA, including titratable acidity (TAC), sugar-acid ratio (SAR), pH, length, diameter, weight, sucrose and citric acid. Six individual sugars, including l-rhamnose monohydrate, fructose, glucose, sucrose, maltose and d-trehalose anhydrous, as well as eight organic acids, including oxalic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, \u03b1-ketoglutaric acid, lactic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid and succinic acid, were identified in red raspberry. The two main clusters according to individual sugar, organic acids and SAR indicated that varieties including 'European red', 'DNS9', 'Bulgaskc', 'Canby' and 'Samodiva' were suitable for fresh-eating or processing to juice or other products directly because they had suitable SAR; other varieties with relatively low SAR were unsuitable for fresh-eating and need to adjust their excessive sour taste during processing.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberries, which contain a variety of nutrients and phytochemicals that are beneficial for human health, can be utilized as a raw material in the creation of several supplements. This research suggests micronized powder of raspberry pomace production. The molecular characteristics (FTIR), sugar, and biological potential (phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity) of micronized raspberry powders were investigated. FTIR spectroscopy results revealed spectral changes in the ranges with maxima at ~1720, 1635, and 1326, as well as intensity changes in practically the entire spectral range analyzed. The discrepancies clearly indicate that the micronization of the raspberry byproduct samples cleaved the intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the polysaccharides present in the samples, thus increasing the respective content of simple saccharides. In comparison to the control powders, more glucose and fructose were recovered from the micronized samples of the raspberry powders. The study's micronized powders were found to contain nine different types of phenolic compounds, including rutin, elagic acid derivatives, cyanidin-3-sophoroside, cyanidin-3-(2-glucosylrutinoside), cyanidin-3-rutinoside, pelargonidin-3-rutinoside, and elagic acid derivatives. Significantly higher concentrations of ellagic acid and ellagic acid derivatives and rutin were found in the micronized samples than in the control sample. The antioxidant potential assessed by ABTS and FRAP significantly increased following the micronization procedure.",

    "abstract": "We designed a portable Raspberry Pi-based spectrometer, which mainly consists of a white LED acting as the wide-spectrum source, a reflection grating for light dispersion, and a CMOS imaging chip aiming at spectral recording. All the optical elements and Raspberry Pi were integrated using 3-D printing structures with a size of 118 mm \u00d7 92 mm \u00d7 84 mm, and home-built software was also designed for spectral recording, calibration, analysis, and display implemented with a touch LCD. Additionally, the portable Raspberry Pi-based spectrometer was equipped with an internal battery, thus supporting on-site applications. Tested by a series of verifications and applications, the portable Raspberry Pi-based spectrometer could reach a spectral resolution of 0.065 nm per pixel within the visible band and provide spectral detection with high accuracy. Therefore, it can be used for on-site spectral testing in various fields.",

    "abstract": "Preparation of an in-situ gel containing lycopene and raspberry plant formulation and analysis of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects is described. Lycopene is known for its anticancer and antioxidant activity. It induces apoptosis, thereby reducing the cancer cells, and also reduces the injury of cells due to oxidative activity. Similarly, raspberry also contains antioxidants properties which can help to reduce oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. This study includes extracts containing 25% of Raspberry and 10% lycopene, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, Carbopol, sodium chloride, and distilled water. This in-situ gel was then tested for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory assay using DPPH (2, diphenyl 1-picryl- hydrazyl- hydrate) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), antioxidant assay revealed that the inhibition percentage was more with 50 \u00b5L (61.3) of gel and anti-inflammatory assay showed significant results with 10 \u00b5L (90.2) of gel. In-situ gel containing lycopene and Raspberry has significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity.",

However, whether bioinocula species composition affects plant growth and soil fertility, and whether fertilizer source influences AMF colonization have not been well characterized. The objectives of this research were to: (1) assess if AMF bioinocula of different species compositions improve raspberry (\nFive bioinocula with different AMF species compositions and three fertilizer sources were applied to tissue culture raspberry transplants in a randomized complete block design with eight replicates. Plants were grown in a greenhouse for 14\u2009weeks and plant growth, tissue nutrient concentrations, soil fertility, and AMF root colonization were measured.\nShoot K and Zn concentrations as well as soil pH and K concentration increased in the Commercial Mix 1 treatment (\nTaken together, our data indicate that coupling organic fertilizers and bioinocula that include diverse AMF species may enhance raspberry growth and soil fertility.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the anti-melanogenic activity of raspberry ketone glucoside (RKG) and further explore the specific molecular mechanisms by which RKG affects melanogenesis.\nThe B16F10 cells model, the mushroom tyrosinase model and the zebrafish model were used to assess the whitening activity of RKG. We subsequently identified possible pathways related to RKG inhibition of melanogenesis by RNA-seq analysis and qRT-PCR on the zebrafish model, and further explored the effects of key genes on the pathway on the melanogenic effect of RKG by using related pathway inhibitors and Tg [mpeg: EGFP] transgenic zebrafish line.\nRKG could noticeably inhibit melanogenesis in B16F10 cells in vitro and on zebrafish in vivo. The RNA-Seq analysis and the qRT-PCR in zebrafish embryos indicated that the inhibition of melanogenesis by RKG could be achieved by activating JAK1/STAT3 signal pathway and inhibiting the expression levels of the MITFa, TYR, TYRP1a genes directly associated with melanogenesis. The inhibitor tests revealed that the inhibitory effect of the RKG on melanogenesis was restored by the IL6, JAK1/2, and STAT3 inhibitors, specifically STAT3 inhibitor. We further examine the relationship between the JAK1/STAT3 signal pathway and the MITFa. The achieved results indicate that the RKG could activate the zebrafish macrophages via the JAK1, but the inhibition of macrophage activation by loganin did not affect the anti-pigmentation effect of the RKG.\nRKG showed remarkable whitening activity on both B16F10 cells in vitro and zebrafish model in vivo. Furthermore, RKG could inhibit melanogenesis by activating the IL6/JAK1/STAT3 pathway, inhibiting the transcriptional activity of MITFa, and its downstream expression levels of the TYR and TYRP1a genes.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is an economically valuable soft-fruit species with a relatively small (~300 Mb) but highly heterozygous diploid (2n = 2x = 14) genome. Chromosome-scale genome sequences are a vital tool in unravelling the genetic complexity controlling traits of interest in crop plants such as red raspberry, as well as for functional genomics, evolutionary studies, and pan-genomics diversity studies. In this study, we developed genome sequences of a primocane fruiting variety ('Autumn Bliss') and a floricane variety ('Malling Jewel'). The use of long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing data yielded long read lengths that permitted well resolved genome sequences for the two cultivars to be assembled. The de novo assemblies of 'Malling Jewel' and 'Autumn Bliss' contained 79 and 136 contigs respectively, and 263.0 Mb of the 'Autumn Bliss' and 265.5 Mb of the 'Malling Jewel' assembly could be anchored unambiguously to a previously published red raspberry genome sequence of the cultivar 'Anitra'. Single copy ortholog analysis (BUSCO) revealed high levels of completeness in both genomes sequenced, with 97.4% of sequences identified in 'Autumn Bliss' and 97.7% in 'Malling Jewel'. The density of repetitive sequence contained in the 'Autumn Bliss' and 'Malling Jewel' assemblies was significantly higher than in the previously published assembly and centromeric and telomeric regions were identified in both assemblies. A total of 42,823 protein coding regions were identified in the 'Autumn Bliss' assembly, whilst 43,027 were identified in the 'Malling Jewel' assembly. These chromosome-scale genome sequences represent an excellent genomics resource for red raspberry, particularly around the highly repetitive centromeric and telomeric regions of the genome that are less complete in the previously published 'Anitra' genome sequence.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the therapeutic role of calorie-restricted diet (CR) and raspberry ketone (RK) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the implication of sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1)/sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling.\nNAFLD was induced by feeding rats high-fat-fructose-diet (HFFD) for 6 weeks. Rats were then randomly assigned to three groups (n = 6 each); NAFLD group continued on HFFD for another 8 weeks. CR group was switched to CR diet (25% calorie restriction) for 8 weeks and RK group was switched to normal diet and received RK (55 mg/kg/day; orally) for 8 weeks. Another six rats were used as normal control.\nHFFD induced a state of NAFLD indicated by increased fat deposition in liver tissue along with dyslipidemia, elevated liver enzymes, oxidative stress and inflammation. Either CR diet or RK reversed these changes and decreased HFFD-induced elevation of hepatic SphK1, S1P, S1PR1 and TLR4. Of notice, RK along with a normal calorie diet was even better than CR alone in most studied parameters.\nSphK1/S1P and TLR4 are interconnected and related to the establishment of HFFD-induced NAFLD and can be modulated by RK. Supplementation of RK without calorie restriction to patients with NAFLD unable to follow CR diet to achieve their treatment goals would be a promising therapeutic modality.",

    "abstract": "Raspberries (Rubus idaeus L.), occurring in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere and blackberries (R. fruticosus L.), cultivated and growing all over the world, are plant species of the family Rosaceae. These species are susceptible to phytoplasma infections, which cause Rubus stunt disease. It spreads uncontrolled by vegetative propagation of plants (Linck and Reineke 2019a) and by phloem-sucking insect vectors, especially Macropsis fuscula (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) (de Fluiter and van der Meer, 1953; Linck and Reineke 2019b). During a survey in commercial field in June 2021, over 200 raspberry bushes cv Enrosadira exhibiting typical symptoms of Rubus stunt were observed in Central Bohemia. Symptoms included dieback, leaf yellowing/reddening, stunted growth, severe phyllody and fruit malformations. Most diseased plants were growing in the edge rows of the field (about 80%). No symptomatic plants were observed in the middle of the field. Similar symptoms were observed in private gardens in South Bohemia on raspberry cv Rutrago and blackberry (unknown cultivar) in June 2018 and August 2022, respectively. DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) from flower stems and parts affected by phyllody of seven symptomatic plants as well as flower stems, leaf midribs, and petioles of five asymptomatic field plants. The DNA extracts were analyzed by a nested polymerase chain reaction assay using universal phytoplasma P1A/P7A primers followed by R16F2m/R1m and the group-specific R16(V)F1/R1 primers (Bertaccini et al. 2019). All samples from the symptomatic plants yielded an amplicon of expected size, while no product was amplified in asymptomatic plants. The P1A/P7A amplicons from three selected plants (two raspberries and one blackberry, each from different location) were cloned and bi-directionally Sanger sequenced (GenBank Accession Nos.OQ520100-2). The sequences spanned nearly full-length of 16S rRNA gene, 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer, tRNA-Ile gene, and a partial 23S rRNA gene. BLASTn search revealed the highest sequence identity (99.8-99.9%, query coverage 100%) to 'Candidatus Phytoplasma rubi' strain RS (GenBank Accession No. CP114006). To further characterize the 'Ca. P. rubi' strains, all these three samples were subjected to multigene sequence analysis. Sequences from a major portion of the tuf, rplV-rpsC, rpsH-rplR, uvrB-degV, and rplO-SecY-map genes (Acc. Nos. OQ506112-26) were obtained as described previously (Fr\u00e1nov\u00e1 et al. 2016). Comparison to GenBank sequences confirmed their highest identity (99.6-100%, query coverage 100%) with 'Ca. P. rubi' RS strain, regardless of their geographic location and host (raspberry or blackberry). Recently, Bertaccini et al. (2022) suggested the 98,65 % 'Ca. Phytoplasma' strain identity threshold within 16Sr RNA sequences. In this survey, all three strains sequenced shared \u226599.73% sequence identity of the analysed 16S rRNA gene sequences and the high identity in the other genes with the reference 'Ca. P. rubi' RS strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Rubus stunt disease in the Czech Republic as well as the first molecular identification and characterization of 'Ca. P. rubi' from raspberry and blackberry in our country. As Rubus stunt disease is of great economic importance (Linck and Reineke 2019a), the pathogen detection and prompt removal of the diseased shrubs are essential to mitigating the spread and impact of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Many studies show that the intake of raspberries is beneficial to immune-metabolic health, but the responses of individuals are heterogeneous and not fully understood.\nIn a two-arm parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial, immune-metabolic outcomes and plasma metabolite levels were analyzed before and after an 8-week red raspberry consumption. Based on partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) on plasma xenobiotic levels, adherence to the intervention was first evaluated. A second PLS-DA followed by hierarchical clustering was used to classify individuals into response subgroups. Clinical immune and metabolic outcomes, including insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and sensitivity (Matsuda, QUICKI) indices, during the intervention were assessed and compared between response subgroups.\nTwo subgroups of participants, type 1 responders (\nThe beneficial effects associated with red raspberry consumption are subject to inter-individual variability. Metabolomics-based clustering appears to be an effective way to assess adherence to a nutritional intervention and to classify individuals according to their immune-metabolic responsiveness to the intervention.

    "abstract": "The application of direct-injection mass spectrometric (DI-MS) techniques, like Proton Transfer Reaction Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) has been suggested as a reliable phenotyping tool for fruit volatilome assessment in both genetic and quality-related studies. In this study the complexity of raspberry aroma was investigated by a comprehensive untargeted VOC analysis, done by combining SPME-GC-MS and PTR-ToF-MS assessments with multi-block discriminant analysis using the DIABLO mixOmics framework. The aim was to acquire an exhaustive characterization of the raspberry volatilome according to different fruit ripening stages (pink, ripe, and overripe) and genetic variances (50 accessions), as well as to investigate the potential of PTR-ToF-MS as a rapid and high throughput VOC phenotyping tool to address issues related to raspberry fruit quality. Results of this study demonstrated the complementarity between SPME-GC-MS and PTR-ToF-MS techniques to evaluate the raspberry aroma composition. PTR-ToF-MS generates reliable raspberry VOC fingerprints mainly due to a reduced compound fragmentation and precise content estimation. In addition, the high collinearity between isomers of monoterpenes and norisoprenoids, discovered by GC analysis, reduces the main analytic limitation of PTR-ToF-MS of not being able to separate isomeric molecules. The high similarity between the VOC matrices obtained by applying PTR-ToF-MS and SPME-GC-MS confirmed the possibility of using PTR-ToF-MS as a reliable high throughput phenotyping tool for raspberry volatiolome assessment. In addition, results provided by the germplasm collection investigation enabled to distinguish the best performing accessions, based on VOCs composition, to be used as superior parental lines for future breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "Polygalacturonase (PG) is an important hydrolytic enzyme involved in pectin disassembly and the subsequent textural changes during fruit ripening. Although the interaction of fungal PGs with other proteins has been documented, the interaction of plant PGs with other plant proteins has not yet been studied. In this study, the molecular mechanisms involved in raspberry fruit ripening, particularly the polygalacturonase (RiPG) interaction with polygalacturonase inhibiting protein (RiPGIP) and substrate, were investigated with a structural approach. The 3D model of RiPG2 and RiPGIP3 was built using a comparative modeling strategy and validated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The RiPG2 model structure comprises 11 complete coils of right-handed parallel \u03b2-helix architecture, with an average of 27 amino acid residues per turn. The structural model of the RiPGIP3 displays a typical structure of LRR protein, with the right-handed superhelical fold with an extended parallel \u03b2-sheet. The conformational interaction between the RiPG2 protein and RiPGIP3 showed that RiPGIP3 could bind to the enzyme and thereby leave the active site cleft accessible to the substrate. All this evidence indicates that RiPG2 enzyme could interact with RiPGIP3 protein. It can be a helpful model for evaluating protein-protein interaction as a potential regulator mechanism of hydrolase activity during pectin disassembly in fruit ripening.",

Most of the currently available RBDV sequences are from European raspberry isolates. This study aimed to sequence genomic RNA2 of both cultivated and wild raspberry in Kazakhstan and compare them to investigate their genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships, as well as to predict their protein structure. Phylogenetic and population diversity analyses were performed on all available RBDV RNA2, MP and CP sequences. Nine of the isolates investigated in this study formed a new, well-supported clade, while the wild isolates clustered with the European isolates. Predicted protein structure analysis revealed two regions that differed between \u03b1- and \u03b2-structures among the isolates. For the first time, the genetic composition of Kazakhstani raspberry viruses has been characterized.",

    "abstract": "RoboCupJunior is a project-oriented competition for primary and secondary school students that promotes robotics, computer science and programing. Through real life scenarios, students are encouraged to engage in robotics in order to help people. One of the popular categories is Rescue Line, in which an autonomous robot has to find and rescue victims. The victim is in the shape of a silver ball that reflects light and is electrically conductive. The robot should find the victim and place it in the evacuation zone. Teams mostly detect victims (balls) using random walk or distant sensors. In this preliminary study, we explored the possibility of using a camera, Hough transform (HT) and deep learning methods for finding and locating balls with the educational mobile robot Fischertechnik with Raspberry Pi (RPi). We trained, tested and validated the performance of different algorithms (convolutional neural networks for object detection and U-NET architecture for sematic segmentation) on a handmade dataset made of images of balls in different light conditions and surroundings. RESNET50 was the most accurate, and MOBILENET_V3_LARGE_320 was the fastest object detection method, while EFFICIENTNET-B0 proved to be the most accurate, and MOBILENET_V2 was the fastest semantic segmentation method on the RPi. HT was by far the fastest method, but produced significantly worse results. These methods were then implemented on a robot and tested in a simplified environment (one silver ball with white surroundings and different light conditions) where HT had the best ratio of speed and accuracy (4.71 s, DICE 0.7989, IoU 0.6651). The results show that microcomputers without GPUs are still too weak for complicated deep learning algorithms in real-time situations, although these algorithms show much higher accuracy in complicated environment situations.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogelled emulsions (HEs) of linseed oil and pea protein (PP) were produced with four levels (0, 5, 7.5, and 10%) of raspberry extract obtained by a green extraction technique (microwave hydrodiffusion and gravity-MHG). HEs were applied in burgers to replace 50% of pork backfat content. The products' technological, nutritional, oxidative, microbiological, and sensory properties were evaluated. Besides reducing the fat level by approximately 43%, the reformulation reduced the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio to healthy levels, decreased the diameter reduction by 30%, and increased the cooking yield by 11%. Including 7.5 and 10% of raspberry extract in the HEs decreased the oxidative defects caused by the enrichment of the burgers with omega-3 fatty acids. In addition, the raspberry extract did not cause alterations in the mesophilic aerobic count and the burgers' sensory profile.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry leaf products are recommended by health care providers to induce labor despite insufficient efficacy and safety data. Less is known about community pharmacists' knowledge and recommendations regarding raspberry leaf products.\nThe primary end point was to describe New York State community pharmacist recommendations regarding raspberry leaf for labor induction. Secondary end points evaluated pharmacists' assessment of the patient for additional information, citation of a supporting reference, provision of safety and efficacy information, recommendation of a patient-appropriate reference, and change in recommendation after learning about the obstetrician-gynecologist's recommendation.\nUsing a list of registered New York State pharmacies via a Freedom of Information Law request, a randomized representative sample of included pharmacy types (grocery store, drugstore chain, independent, and mass merchandising) was called using a mystery caller approach. Calls were conducted by one investigator throughout July 2022. Data collection included items specific to the primary and secondary outcomes. This study was approved by the associated institutional review board.\nNew York State community pharmacists from grocery store, drugstore chain, independent, and mass merchandising pharmacies were called using the mystery caller approach.\nThe primary endpoint was measured by the number of evidence-based recommendations made by pharmacists.\nThe study included 366 pharmacies. Despite insufficient efficacy and safety data, there were 308 recommendations to use raspberry leaf products (n\u00a0= 308 of 366, 84.1%). Most pharmacists attempted to collect additional patient information (n\u00a0= 278 of 366, 76.0%). Many pharmacists did not clearly convey safety (n\u00a0= 168 of 366, 45.9%) or efficacy (n\u00a0= 197 of 366, 53.8%) information. Of those who discussed safety or efficacy, many said raspberry leaf products were safe and effective (n\u00a0= 125 of 198, 63.1%; n\u00a0= 82 of 169, 48.5%). Pharmacists often referred or deferred the patient to another medical professional for more information (n\u00a0= 92 of 282, 32.6%).\nThere is an opportunity to improve pharmacists' knowledge on the use of raspberry leaf products for the induction of labor and in making evidence-based recommendations when limited or conflicting efficacy and safety data exist.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) is transmitted through seed in infected red raspberry plants after pollination with pollen grains from healthy red raspberry plants. Here, we show that RBDV is not transmitted through seeds in infected Nicotiana benthamiana (Nb) plants after pollination with virus-free Nb pollen grains. Chromogenic in situ hybridization revealed that the virus invades the shoot apical meristem and the ovule, including the embryo sac, of RBDV-infected Nb plants; however, in seeds that developed from infected embryo sacs after fertilization by virus-free sperm cells, RBDV was absent in the embryos and present in the endosperms. When we analyzed seed transmission of RBDV in Nb mutants with mutations in dicer-like enzyme 2 and 4 (NbDCL2&4) or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (NbRDR6), RBDV was not present in the offspring from seeds with embryos and endosperms that did not express NbDCL2&4 or NbRDR6. These results suggest that seed transmission of RBDV is prevented by evasion of infection by the embryo and that RNA silencing is not essential for preventing seed transmission of RBDV in Nb plants.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry Ketone (RK) and Resveratrol (RSV) are natural phenolic antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. However, its combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics potentials are not reported. The study aims to assess the combined effect of RK with RSV to protect rats from carbon-tetrachloride (CCl4) induced oxidative stress and NASH. The toxicant CCl4 was employed at a concentration of 1\u2009mL/kg as a 1:1 (v/v) mixture with olive oil twice weekly for 6 weeks to induce liver toxicity. Animal treatment was followed for 2 weeks. Silymarin was used as a standard control drug to compare the hepatoprotective effect of RK and RSV. Hepatic histology, oxidative stress, MMP, reduced glutathione (GSH), plasma levels of SGOT, SGPT, and lipid profile (total cholesterol and triglycerides) were measured. Anti-inflammation genes (IL-10), and fibrotic genes (TGF-\u03b2) were also examined in liver tissue. Oral administration of combined RK with RSV (50\u2009+\u200950\u2009mg/kg for 2 weeks) showed significantly more hepatoprotection by significantly decreasing elevated plasma markers and lipid profile than alone RK and RSV (100\u2009mg/kg daily for 2 weeks). It also significantly alleviated the hepatic lipid peroxidation, restoring the activities of GSH levels in the liver. RT-PCR and Immunoblotting studies confirmed that significantly upregulation of anti-inflammation genes and protein expression (MMP-9) ameliorated the disease. Pharmacokinetic studies confirmed more synergistic stability in simulated gastric-intestinal fluids (FaSSGF, FaSSIF) and rat liver microsomes (CYP-450, NADPH oxidation & glucuronidation. Moreover, coadministration of drugs augmented the relative bioavailability, V",

    "abstract": "Monitoring plant responses to stress is an ongoing challenge for crop breeders, growers, and agronomists. The measurement of below-ground stress is particularly challenging as plants do not always show visible signs of stress in the above-ground organs, particularly at early stages. Hyperspectral imaging is a technique that could be used to overcome this challenge if associations between plant spectral data and specific stresses can be determined. In this study, three genotypes of red raspberry plants grown under controlled conditions in a glasshouse were subjected to below-ground biotic stresses (root pathogen ",

    "abstract": "The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the influence of two carrier agents, Nopal and Aloe Vera mucilage on the physicochemical properties and stability of blackberry and raspberry powders obtained by spray drying. A pilot scale spray dryer with a feed flow of 20 L/h and an atomization speed of 28,000\u2005rpm was used. The inlet and outlet air temperatures were from 180 to 80 \u00b0C, respectively. Yield, moisture content, water activity, hygroscopicity index, solubility time, volumetric density, stability diagrams, micrographs, and particle temperature were evaluated. The highest yields for blackberry extract were 75% with a concentration of 2.5% (w/v) Nopal mucilage, while raspberry extract yielded 65% with a concentration of 5% (w/v) Nopal mucilage. The increase in the concentration of the carrier agent presented an increase in the values of humidity, water activity, volumetric density, and solubility when Nopal mucilage was used as a carrier agent in both blackberry and raspberry extracts. Furthermore, when Aloe Vera mucilage was used as a carrier agent, these same values decreased with increasing concentration. The storage conditions of the powders obtained should be stored at temperatures below 20\u00b0C and water activities below 0.4. In addition, the stability diagrams show the particle conditions that should not be exceeded during spray drying.",

    "abstract": "Objective This study was performed to clarify the prevalence of raspberry-type gastric foveolar-type tumors, along with the time-course changes in the size and clinical course. Methods The subjects were 10,663 consecutive patients who underwent a medical checkup between April 2016 and March 2022, including an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) examination and determination of Helicobacter pylori infection status (uninfected, positive, post-eradication). The presence of characteristic reddish polypoid lesions in the stomach was investigated, and a diagnosis of raspberry-type gastric foveolar-type tumor was made based on histological findings. Results Thirty-eight cases had gastric polyps with a raspberry-like appearance on endoscopy, with 29 lesions in 28 cases endoscopically and histologically diagnosed as a raspberry-type gastric foveolar-type tumor. All of the affected subjects were determined to be H. pylori-uninfected. The prevalence of this type of lesion in all subjects was 0.26%, while that in the 6,635 H. pylori-uninfected subjects was 0.42%. An older age and the presence of a fundic gland polyp were found to be significant risk factors associated with the occurrence of the tumor. The mean size was 3.8\u00b11.9 (range: 2-10) mm, and the location was in a fundic gland area in all affected subjects. Furthermore, examinations of previous EGD images revealed that two-thirds of the lesions had not changed in size, while follow-up EGD findings showed that lesions \u22645 mm in size had disappeared after a biopsy procedure. Conclusion The prevalence of raspberry-type gastric foveolar-type tumors was 0.42% in H. pylori-uninfected subjects. More than half of the lesions were too small to be removed by an endoscopic biopsy.",

    "abstract": "A systematic review and meta-analysis were designed to summarize studies conducted on the effects of raspberry and blackcurrant consumption on blood pressure (BP). Eligible studies were detected by searching numerous five online databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, until December 17, 2022. We pooled the mean difference and its 95% confidence interval (CI) by applying a random-effects model. Overall, the impact of raspberry and blackcurrant on BP was reported in ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (420 subjects). Pooled analysis of six clinical trials revealed that raspberry consumption has no significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (weighted mean differences [WMDs], -1.42; 95% CI, -3.27 to 0.87; p = 0.224) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (WMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -1.77 to 0.71; p = 0.401), in comparison with placebo. Moreover, pooled analysis of four clinical trials indicated that blackcurrant consumption did not reduce SBP (WMD, -1.46; 95% CI, -6.62 to 3.7; p = 0.579), and DBP (WMD, -2.09; 95% CI, -4.38 to 0.20; p = 0.07). Raspberry and blackcurrant consumption elicited no significant reductions in BP. More accurate RCTs are required to clarify the impact of raspberry and blackcurrant intake on BP.",

    "abstract": "Identifying genetic variations or treatments that confer greater resistance to drought is paramount to ensuring sustainable crop productivity. Accurate and reproducible measurement of drought stress symptoms can be achieved via automated, image-based phenotyping. Many phenotyping platforms are either cost-prohibitive, require specific technical expertise, or are simply more complex than necessary to effectively evaluate drought resistance. Certain mutations, allelic variations, or treatments result in plants that constitutively use less water. To accurately identify genetic differences or treatments that confer a drought phenotype, plants from all experimental groups must be subjected to equal levels of drought stress. This can be easily achieved by growing and imaging plants that are grown in the same pot. Here, we provide a detailed protocol to configure a Raspberry Pi computer and camera module to image seedlings of multiple genotypes growing in shared pots and to transfer images and metadata via the cloud for downstream analyses. Also detailed is a method to calculate percent soil water content of pots while being imaged to allow for comparison of stress symptoms with water availability. This protocol was recently used to uncouple differential water usage from drought resistance in a dwarf ",

    "abstract": "A 32-year-old female with no cardiac risk factors was admitted for treatment of a perianal abscess. During her hospital stay, she had a pulseless electrical activity arrest with a return of spontaneous circulation after one round of cardiopulmonary\u00a0resuscitation (CPR). After transfer to the\u00a0Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the patient had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) requiring defibrillation shock. Her PVT was resistant to medical interventions. She was shocked a total of 33 times before her arrhythmia was terminated by passing a temporary transvenous pacemaker with overdrive pacing. After an extensive review of her history and presentation, no clear cause of her resistant arrhythmia was identified, however, she was found to have recently started taking over-the-counter weight loss supplements containing raspberry ketones which is a potentially cardiotoxic ingredient.",

    "abstract": "Currently, remote laboratories have gained relevance in engineering education as tools to support active learning, experimentation, and motivation of students. Nonetheless, the costs and issues regarding their implementation and deployment limit the access of the students and educators to their advantages and features such as technical and educational. In this line, this study describes a fully open-source remote laboratory in hardware and software for education in automatic control systems employing Raspberry Pi and Python language with an approximate cost of USD 461. Even, by changing some components, the cost can be reduced to USD 420 or less. To illustrate the functionalities of the laboratory, we proposed a low-cost tank control system with its respective instrumentation, signal conditioning, identification, and control, which are exposed in this document. However, other experiments can be easily scalable and adaptable to the remote laboratory. Concerning the interface of the laboratory, we designed a complete user-friendly web interface with real-time video for the users to perform the different activities in automatic control such as identification or controller implementation through the programming language Python. The instructions to build and replicate the hardware and software are indicated in the open repositories provided for the project as well as in this paper. Our intention with this project is to offer a complete low-cost and open-source remote laboratory that can be adapted and used for the students, educators, and stakeholders to learn, experiment, and teach in the field of automatic control systems.",

    "abstract": "The amount of berry polyphenols required to exert health-promoting effects seems to be difficult to achieve by fresh fruit ingestion, so polyphenol-rich extracts could be considered a dietary alternative. In the present study, laboratory rats were fed high-fat diets supplemented with 0.1 or 0.3% raspberry polyphenols from pomace, with the former dose reflecting the amount of polyphenols consumed with a glass of fresh raspberries. It was hypothesized that beneficial changes in blood and hepatic tissue related to lipid metabolism would accompany both treatments, but the health-promoting effect would be more noticeable with the higher dose of extract. This hypothesis was confirmed, and the high dose of raspberry polyphenols was better than the low dose extract in terms of decreased epididymal white adipose tissue weight, hepatic triglyceride content, PPAR\u03b3 and SREBP-1c expression in the liver, and plasma IL-6 concentration, as well as increased acetic acid concentration in the cecal digesta. These effects might be partially associated with the enhanced content of ellagitannin and anthocyanin metabolites found in the blood plasma of rats administered the high dose of the extract. The results showed that this extract could be considered a dietary vehicle to provide an amount of raspberry polyphenols that could promote health.",

    "abstract": "After cold-pressing, small particles of seed residue remain in raspberry seed oil (RSO), even after passing it through cold filtration. The removal of the remaining seed residue is rather an alternative option to improve the visual properties of RSO. This study investigated the influence that the seeds\u2019 age (0, 10, 20 months) and clarification process after pressing has on the oxidative stability and phase transition of RSO by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results proved that the oil centrifugation process reduces the DPPH radical scavenging activity and oxidative stability measured by p-anisidine value (p-AnV) and DSC oxidation induction time (OIT) at 120 \u00b0C of all RSO samples, regardless of the age of the seeds (p \u2264 0.05). No significant differences were observed on the DSC melting and crystallization properties at 1 \u00b0C/min after the oil clarification by centrifugation (p > 0.05). The storage time of raspberry seeds, i.e., 10 and 20 months after expiry date, influenced the quality deterioration of RSO, as measured by higher p-AnV, lower DPPH, and OIT values (p \u2264 0.05). The results presented provide new information about oil production processing, suggesting that producers should reconsider giving up the clarification process of oil, since it lowers all quality parameters.",

    "abstract": "Red imported fire ants (RIFA) are an alien invasive pest that can cause serious ecosystem damage. Timely detection, location and elimination of RIFA nests can further control the spread of RIFA. In order to accurately locate the RIFA nests, this paper proposes an improved deep learning method of YOLOv4. The specific methods were as follows: 1) We improved GhostBottleNeck (GBN) and replaced the original CSP block of YOLOv4, so as to compress the network scale and reduce the consumption of computing resources. 2) An Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism was introduced into GBN to enhance the feature extraction ability of the model. 3) We used Equalized Focal Loss to reduce the loss value of background noise. 4) We increased and improved the upsampling operation of YOLOv4 to enhance the understanding of multi-layer semantic features to the whole network. 5) CutMix was added in the model training process to improve the model's ability to identify occluded objects. The parameters of improved YOLOv4 were greatly reduced, and the abilities to locate and extract edge features were enhanced. Meanwhile, we used an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to collect images of RIFA nests with different heights and scenes, and we made the RIFA nests (RIFAN) airspace dataset. On the RIFAN dataset, through qualitative analysis of the evaluation indicators, mean average precision (MAP) of the improved YOLOv4 model reaches 99.26%, which is 5.9% higher than the original algorithm. Moreover, compared with Faster R-CNN, SSD and other algorithms, improved YOLOv4 has achieved excellent results. Finally, we transplanted the model to the embedded device Raspberry Pi 4B and assembled it on the UAV, using the model's lightweight and high-efficiency features to achieve flexible and fast flight detection of RIFA nests.",

    "abstract": "Electrospray (ES) is a new non-thermal processing technology for pasteurising liquid foods. This study aimed to investigate the effects of ES on the cell structure and function of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus and then compare the effects of ES and heat treatment (HT) on microbial inactivation and flavour composition in honey raspberry wine. First, we found that the inactivation effect of ES treatment on the three microorganisms was significantly influenced by the voltage intensity. The degree of damage to the cellular structures and functions of the three microorganisms increased with increasing voltage. Second, the environment in which the microorganisms were present significantly influenced the ES pasteurisation effect. Pasteurisation by ES was better when the three microorganisms were in honey raspberry wine than in saline. Finally, the total number of colonies in honey raspberry wine was reduced from 4.50 to 2.03 log colony forming units/mL after ES treatment, and the wine had good stability during storage (84\u00a0days at 4\u00a0\u00b0C). In the honey raspberry wine, the contents of the main flavour substances (ketones and esters) did not change significantly after ES treatment, but HT decreased the content of esters and ketones by 13.5\u00a0% and 75.4\u00a0%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Dark septate endophytes (DSEs) can form reciprocal symbioses with most terrestrial plants, providing them with mineral nutrients in exchange for photosynthetic products. Although the mechanism of plant-DSEs is well understood at the transcriptional level, little is known about their post-transcriptional regulation, and microRNAs (miRNAs) for the symbiotic process of DSE infestation of raspberry have not been identified. In this study, we comprehensively identified the miRNAs of DSE-infested raspberry symbiosis using Illumina sequencing. A total of 361 known miRNAs and 95 novel miRNAs were identified in the roots. Similar to other dicotyledons, most of the identified raspberry miRNAs were 21\u2009nt in length. Thirty-seven miRNAs were differentially expressed during colonization after inoculation with ",

    "abstract": "The primary aim of this experiment was to investigate the bioactivity potential and polyphenolic profile of defatted raspberry seeds (DRS) extracts from three varieties (Willamette, Meeker, and Polka) using the in vitro tests HPLC-DAD and UHPLC-Triple-TOF-MS. Extracts were obtained using ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) or hydrolysis. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was tested using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic) cation (ABTS), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. Furthermore, the extracts were tested for antimicrobial activity using the disk diffusion method for four bacterial cultures (",

    "abstract": "Raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is an economically important fruit crop in Canada and about 80% of red raspberries are cultivated in British Columbia. In 2018, foliar symptoms associated with root rot and wilting complex disease were observed in raspberry field of Fraser Valley areas of British Columbia. Plants were stunted with reduced numbers of primocanes. Chlorosis and necrosis on leaves and partial wilting of branches were observed. When plants were uprooted, necrosis and browning on roots were observed. Two isolates of oomycetes pathogen were isolated using baiting with rhododendron leaves and pear fruit as described in Sapkota et al. 2022. Using FastDNA Spin kit (MP Biomedical, Burlingame, CA), genomic DNA of pathogen isolates was extracted from mycelia cultured on 20% clarified V8 agar medium amended with 10 mg pimaricin, 250 mg ampicillin, 10 mg rifampicin (V8PAR) per liter following the manufacturer's standard protocol. Pathogens were identified using colony morphology on 20% clarified V8 PAR as well as internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing with ITS1 primers (White et al. 1990) and multiplex targeted-sequencing with degenerate primers of three nuclear genes: heat shock protein90 (HSP90), elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1\u03b1) and beta tubulin (\u03b2tub). BLAST searches of ITS sequences of isolates of this study (accession nos. OP180065, OP180066) in NCBI GenBank showed 98.5 to 99.6% identity with the ITS sequence of P. gonapodyides (accession nos. MN513238.1, MG753496.1). Multiplex targeted sequencing also identified both isolates as a P. gonapodyides (accession nos. SRR20227809, SRR20227807) when mapped with the reference sequences (accession nos. HSP90: KX251233.1, EF1\u03b1: KX251231.1, \u03b2-tub: KX639710.1). Pathogenicity was confirmed by inoculating mycelial suspension of one isolate of P. gonapodyides on root of intact plants and mycelial plugs of two isolates on detached stems of the raspberry plants, 'Chemainus' in the greenhouse using methods described in Sapkota et al. 2022. Two experiments were conducted with three replicates in each test. Experiments were arranged using completely randomized design. In detached stem assays, distinct dark-lesion symptom appeared at 7 to 9 days after inoculation while uninoculated control stems remained asymptomatic. Intact plants showed wilting and foliar symptoms 15 days after inoculation and progressed higher at 4 to 5 weeks after inoculation. Root infection with dark brown to black color was observed when roots were assessed at 5 weeks after inoculation. The diseased root and crown tissues tested positive for Phytophthora in Agdia ImmunoStrip and P. gonapodyides was re-isolated and confirmed with multiplex-targeted sequencing. Phytophthora gonapodyides was previously reported from raspberry in Chile (Wilcox and Latorre 2002). To our best knowledge, this is the first report of P. gonapodyides infecting red raspberry in British Columbia, Canada. The detection of new Phytophthora species on raspberry may become a new potential problem to growers in addition to P. rubi, which is already a major cause of raspberry decline in the region.",

    "abstract": "Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is still a global health concern. Long-term alcohol intake alters the gut microbiota diversity and metabolic activity, and causes intestinal barrier dysfunction, leading to the development of ALD. This research explored the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of red raspberry (RR) on alcohol-related disorders in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a standard diet or a standard diet supplemented with 2%, 4%, and 8% weight/weight RR. Meanwhile, mice were administered 35% (v/v) ethanol (EtOH, 10 mL per kg body weight) intragastrically once daily for six weeks, except the control group mice. The results showed that RR supplementation decreased liver injury markers (alanine and aspartate transaminases) in the serum, reduced triglyceride level in the liver and downregulated hepatic cytochrome P450 2E1 mRNA expression in mice administered EtOH. In addition, EtOH-mediated oxidative stress in the liver was attenuated by RR supplementation through decreased hepatic malondialdehyde content and increased antioxidant (glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase) levels and activities in mice exposed to EtOH. Moreover, RR supplementation reversed EtOH-induced alteration in the cecal microbial composition at the phylum, order, genus, and species levels and improved the intestinal barrier function associated with the inhibition of the NF-\u03baB/MLCK pathway, which was accompanied by upregulation of tight junctions (zonula occludens 1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-4) and E-cadherin mRNA and protein expressions. Accordingly, RR supplementation resulted in a decreased level of endotoxins in the serum and attenuation of the inflammatory response in the liver, illustrated by a significant decrease in tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6 levels. Overall, RR supplementation alleviated the adverse effects of chronic alcohol intake in C57BL/6J mice and could be a potential supplement for improving ALD.",

    "abstract": "Single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi make it easy to control hardware setups for laboratory experiments. GPIOs and expansion boards (HATs) give access to a whole range of sensor and control hardware. However, controlling such hardware can be challenging, when many experimental setups run in parallel and the time component is critical. LabNet is a C++ optimized control layer software to give access to the Raspberry Pi connected hardware over a simple network protocol. LabNet was developed to be suitable for time-critical operations, and to be simple to expand. It leverages the actor model to simplify multithreading programming and to increase modularity. The message protocol is implemented in Protobuf and offers performance, small message size, and supports a large number of programming languages on the client side. It shows good performance compared to locally executed tools like Bpod, pyControl, or Autopilot and reaches sub-millisecond range in network communication latencies. LabNet can monitor and react simultaneously to up to 14 pairs of digital inputs, without increasing latencies. LabNet itself does not provide support for the design of experimental tasks. This is left to the client. LabNet can be used for general automation in experimental laboratories with its control PC located at some distance. LabNet is open source and under continuing development.",

    "abstract": "Advances in biomedical and engineering fields have greatly increased the need for understanding of soft structures. Soft materials such as gelatin and gelatin-based hydrogels have grown in popularity for use in a wide variety of applications including tissue engineering, biofabrication, and organ transplantation. With hydrogel structures being used in such demanding applications, it is crucial to properly characterize the dynamic behavior of these soft structures. Although there have been major improvements in measurement technology for determining the mechanical properties of soft, translucent materials, it remains quite challenging to reliably measure the Young's and shear moduli of these materials in a way that remains straightforward, low-cost, and non-contact. This research aims to address the weaknesses in modern measurement methods and develop a system suitable for characterizing the elastic moduli of soft materials that requires only four, inexpensive, off-the-shelf components. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi, stepping motor, and an inexpensive camera, the Young's and shear moduli of a gelatin column is measured five times. The standard deviation between measurement was observed to be less than 0.15% with high accuracy having an error of less than 4.6% when compared to relatively expensive, conventional measurement techniques.",

    "abstract": "The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is widely used as a promising high-throughput model organism in neurobehavioral research. The mobility of zebrafish can be dissected into multiple behavior endpoints to assess its neurobehavioral performance. However, such facilities on the market are expensive and clumsy to be used in laboratories. Here, we designed a low-cost, automatic zebrafish behavior assay apparatus, barely without unintentional human operational errors. The data acquisition part, composed of Raspberry Pi and HQ Camera, automatically performs video recording and data storage. Then, the data processing process is also on the Raspberry Pi. Water droplets and inner wall reflection of multi-well cell culture plates (used for placing zebrafish) will affect the accuracy of object recognition. And during the rapid movement of zebrafish, the probability of zebrafish tracking loss increased significantly. Thus, ROI region and related thresholds were set, and the Kalman filter algorithm was performed to estimate the best position of zebrafish in each frame. In addition, all functions of this device are realized by the custom-written behavior analysis algorithm, which makes the optimization of the setup more efficient. Furthermore, this setup was also used to analyze the behavioral changes of zebrafish under different concentrations of alcohol exposure to verify the reliability and accuracy. The alcohol exposure induced an inverted U-shape dose-dependent behavior change in zebrafish, which was consistent with previous studies, showcasing that the data obtained from the setup proposed in this study are accurate and reliable. Finally, the setup was comprehensively assessed by evaluating the accuracy of zebrafish detection (precision, recall, F-score), and predicting alcohol concentration by XGBoost. In conclusion, this study provides a simple, and low-cost package for the determination of multiple behavioral parameters of zebrafish with high accuracy, which could be easily adapted for various other fields.",

    "abstract": "A wireless impedance monitoring system, called SSeL-Pi, is designed to have cheap, mobile, and handy practical features as compared to wired commercial impedance analyzers. A Raspberry Pi platform impedance sensor node is designed to measure signals at a low-frequency range of up to 100 kHz. The low-frequency impedance measurement via the proposed node has been combined with a new PZT interface technique for measuring local responses sensitive to structural damage. The new PZT interface can work as a surface-mounted or embedded sensor, and its local dynamic characteristics are numerically analyzed to pre-determine an effective impedance resonant frequency range of less than 100 kHz. Next, a software scheme was designed to visualize the input/output parameters of the proposed SSeL-Pi system (i.e., Raspberry Pi platform and PZT interface) and automate signal acquisition procedures of the impedance sensor node. The calibration for impedance signals obtained from the proposed system was performed by a series of procedures, from acquiring real and imaginary impedance to adjusting them with respect to a commercial impedance analyzer (HIOKI-3532). The feasibility of the wireless impedance monitoring system was experimentally evaluated for PZT interfaces that were subjected to various compressive loadings. The consistent results analyzed from signals measured by the SSeL-Pi and HIOKI 3532 systems were observed. Additionally, the strong relationships between impedance features (frequency shift and RMSD index) and compressive stresses of the PZT interfaces showed the potential for axial force/stress variation monitoring in real structures using the Raspberry Pi platform impedance sensor node and developed PZT interface.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, raspberry breeding has shifted its emphasis from agronomic performance to characteristics related to the sensory qualities of the fruit and its potential health benef its. The therapeutic and preventive properties of raspberries are related to their biochemical composition. In this regard, the purpose of the work was to determine the content of macro- and micronutrients in fruits of different cultivars of repair raspberry using modern high-tech analytical methods and the selection of genetic sources of the analyzed elements for further breeding. The objects of the research were 17 cultivars of repair raspberry of different ecological and geographical origin from the genetic plant bioresource collection of FSBSO ARHCBAN. It was found that the ash residue of berries contains 12 major elements, which form the following descending series: K > P > Mg \u2265 Mo > Ca > S \u2265 Ni > Zn > Mn > Se > Fe \u2265 Co. The largest proportion of ash residue in raspberry fruits is K. Depending on the cultivar, its quantity averaged from 12.81 wt % (Samorodok and Karamelka) to 22.37 wt % (Atlant). The minimum K content was observed in the ash of the Carolina cultivar (5.62 wt %), while in berries of this cultivar Mg (2.91), Ca (2.62) and Zn (0.14 wt %) accumulated above average. Among the group of early maturing cultivars, the cultivar Yubileinaya Kulikova stands out with a high content of Mo (4.63), Ca (2.19), Fe (0.25) and Co (0.21 wt %). The cultivar Pingvin is characterized by a high content of K (22.65) and Se (0.31 wt %). The medium maturity cultivar Samorodok is characterized by a higher content of P (4.08), S (0.47), Ni (0.51) and Zn (0.26 wt %). Among the late maturing cultivars, the cultivar Poranna Rosa stands out with the preferential accumulation of nine elements: Mg (2.98), P (4.42), S (0.36), K (20.34), Ca (1.71), Mn (0.14), Co (0.13), Se (0.21) and Mo (3.08 wt %). Correlation relationships between the elements have been established. Samples with the highest accumulation of macro- and microelements in berries represent genetic sources for further selection of raspberry for improvement of the mineral composition of fruits.\n\u0412

    "abstract": "The present study was conducted to determine the effects of spray-dried raspberry powder (SDRP) (CONTROL, 1.0%, 2.0%, and 3.0%) as a natural antioxidant, antimicrobial, and colorant on physicochemical properties, lipid oxidation, discoloration, and microbial quality of vacuum-packed (VP) ground beef during chilled storage at 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00b0C for 18\u00a0days. By incorporating SDRP into VP ground beef pH, lipid oxidation (TBARS), lightness, and hue angle (h\u00b0) values decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01), while redness (a*) and chroma (C*) values improved (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). SDRP treatments had higher redness, more stable color, and lower pH and TBARS values during storage in a dose-dependent manner (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), demonstrating that SDRP had a preventive effect on lipid oxidation and discoloration. The combination of vacuum packaging with SDRP generally resulted in lower bacterial growth during storage. These results demonstrated that 2% or 3% SDRP treatment has promising potential as an effective strategy to achieve oxidative and microbial stability and overcome discoloration in VP fresh meats.",

    "abstract": "Despite the growing interest in the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as a potential biometric for subject identification and the recent advances in the use of deep learning (DL) models to study neurological signals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), electroretinogram (ERG), and electromyogram (EMG), there has been a lack of exploration in the use of state-of-the-art DL models for EEG-based subject identification tasks owing to the high variability in EEG features across sessions for an individual subject. In this paper, we explore the use of state-of-the-art DL models such as ResNet, Inception, and EEGNet to realize EEG-based biometrics on the BED dataset, which contains EEG recordings from 21 individuals. We obtain promising results with an accuracy of 63.21%, 70.18%, and 86.74% for Resnet, Inception, and EEGNet, respectively, while the previous best effort reported accuracy of 83.51%. We also demonstrate the capabilities of these models to perform EEG biometric tasks in real-time by developing a portable, low-cost, real-time Raspberry Pi-based system that integrates all the necessary steps of subject identification from the acquisition of the EEG signals to the prediction of identity while other existing systems incorporate only parts of the whole system.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK; [4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone]) is a synthetic flavoring agent and dietary supplement for weight control. This study investigated the metabolic signature of oral doses of RK that prevent weight gain or promote loss of righting reflex (LORR) in C57Bl/6J mice. Daily RK 200\u00a0mg/kg prevented high-fat diet (HFD; 45% Kcal fat) fed weight gain (\u223c8% reduction) over 35 days. RNA-seq of inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT) performed in males revealed 12 differentially expressed genes. Apelin (Apln) and potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily C member (Kcnc3) expression were elevated with HFD and normalized with RK dosing, which was confirmed by qPCR. Acute RK 640\u00a0mg/kg produced a LORR with a <5\u00a0min onset with a >30\u00a0min duration. Acute RK 200\u00a0mg/kg increased gene expression of Apln, Kcnc3, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), but reduced acetyl-COA carboxylase (Acc1) and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (Nqo1) in inguinal WAT. Acute RK 640\u00a0mg/kg elevated interleukin 6 (Il 6) and heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1) expression, but reduced Nrf2 in inguinal and epididymal WAT. Our findings suggest that RK has a dose-dependent metabolic signature in WAT associated with either weight control or LORR.",

    "abstract": "Digital imaging permits the quantitation of many experiments, such as microbiological growth assays, but laboratory digital imaging systems can be expensive and too specialised. The Raspberry Pi camera platform makes automated, controlled imaging affordable with accessible customisation. When combined with open source software and open-source 3D printed hardware, the control over image quality and capture of this platform permits the rapid development of novel instrumentation. Here we present \"PiRamid\", a compact, portable, and inexpensive enclosure for autonomous imaging both in the laboratory and in the field. The modular three-piece 3D printed design makes it easy to incorporate different camera systems or lighting configurations (e.g., single wavelength LED for fluorescence). The enclosed design allows complete control of illumination unlike a conventional digital camera or smartphone, on a tripod or handheld, under ambient lighting. The stackable design permits rapid sample addition or camera focus adjustment, with a corresponding change in magnification and resolution. The entire unit is small enough to fit within a microbiological incubator, and cheap enough (\u223c\u00a3100) to scale out for larger parallel experiments. Simply, Python scripts fully automate illumination and image capture for small-scale experiments with an \u223c110\u00d785 mm area at 70-90 \u00b5m resolution. We demonstrate the versatility of PiRamid by capturing time-resolved, quantitative image data for a wide range of assays. Bacterial growth kinetics was captured for conventional microbiology (agar Petri dishes), 3D printed custom microbiology labware and microfluidic microbiology. To illustrate application beyond microbiology, we demonstrate time-lapse imaging of crystal growth and degradation of salad leaves. Minor modifications permit epi-illumination by addition of a LED ring to the camera module. We conclude that PiRamid permits inexpensive digital capture and quantitation of a wide range of experiments by time-lapse imaging to simplify both laboratory and field imaging.",

    "abstract": "Phytophthora species are primary causal agents of raspberry root rot and wilting complex (RRWC), a disease complex that is of major concern to raspberry producers worldwide. Accurate identification of the causal agents is a first step for effective disease management. Advancements in molecular diagnostics can facilitate the detection of multiple pathogen species associated with this disease complex. We developed multiplex targeted-sequencing methods using degenerate primers for heat shock protein 90, elongation factor 1\u03b1 and \u03b2-tubulin genes to identify Phytophthora species causing RRWC. One hundred and twenty-eight isolates recovered during 2018 to 2020 from diverse fields in major raspberry growing areas of British Columbia (BC) were sequenced and identified by comparing with known reference sequences of 142 Phytophthora species, 111 Pythium species, and nine Phytopythium species in the NCBI database. This multiplex targeted-sequencing method was highly specific and identified two species of Phytophthora associated with RRWC. These were P. rubi (85% of isolates) and P. gonapodyides (15% of isolates). Phytophthora rubi was predominantly isolated from the cultivars 'Chemainus' (51%), 'Rudi' (27%) and 'Meeker' (15%), whereas P. gonapodyides was predominately isolated from the moderately resistant cultivar 'Cascade Bounty'. Pathogenicity studies on intact plants and detached leaves confirmed that P. rubi and P. gonapodyides can cause symptoms of RRWC on raspberry, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. gonapodyides as a causal agent of RRWC on raspberry in BC. This study provides novel insights into the identification and species composition of Phytophthora associated with RRWC in raspberry production systems.",

    "abstract": "As demonstrated by us earlier and by other researchers, a diet containing freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB) inhibits DNA damage and carcinogenesis in animal models. We tested the hypothesis that the inhibition of DNA damage by BRB is due, in part, to the enhancement of DNA repair capacity evaluated in the human HeLa cell extract system, an established in vitro system for the assessment of cellular DNA repair activity. The pre-treatment of intact HeLa cells with BRB extracts (BRBE) enhances the nucleotide excision repair (NER) of a bulky deoxyguanosine adduct derived from the polycyclic aromatic carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BP-dG) by ~24%. The NER activity of an oxidatively-derived non-bulky DNA lesion, guanidinohydantoin (Gh), is also enhanced by ~24%, while its base excision repair activity is enhanced by only ~6%. Western Blot experiments indicate that the expression of selected, NER factors is also increased by BRBE treatment by ~73% (XPA), ~55% (XPB), while its effects on XPD was modest (<14%). These results demonstrate that BRBE significantly enhances the NER yields of a bulky and a non-bulky DNA lesion, and that this effect is correlated with an enhancement of expression of the critically important NER factor XPA and the helicase XPB, but not the helicase XPD.",

    "abstract": "Polyphenols, ubiquitous in plant-originated foods, exhibit multifarious health benefits but are notorious for their low bioavailability. As the majority of polyphenols enter the colon where they are metabolized into the more bioavailable metabolites with multifarious bioactivities, gut microbiota composition is critical for realizing the health benefits of polyphenols. Black raspberries (BRB) are highly abundant in health-promoting but poorly absorbable polyphenols, primarily ellagitannins and anthocyanins. This study aimed to dissect the bilateral interactions between polyphenols and gut microbiotas of diverse origins. Using an optimized extraction procedure, BRB polyphenols were first comprehensively characterized by UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. Next, in vitro anaerobic fermentations with microbiota from human adults, infants, rats, and mice were conducted for comparison of phenolic profile (by metabolomics) and microbiota composition (by 16S rDNA sequencing) before and after fermentation. Bioinformatics analysis further revealed unique polyphenol-microbiota interactions and identified several bacterial species that could potentially produce bioactive and bioavailable phenolic metabolites following BRB consumption.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. Raspberry fruits contain polyphenols which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we used molecular imprinting technology to efficiently isolate phenolic components from the raspberry ethyl acetate extracts. Six phenolic components (ellagic acid, tiliroside, kaempferol-3-o-rutoside, gallic acid, ferulic acid and vanillic acid) were identified by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis. Molecular docking was used to predict the anti-inflammatory effects and anti-Alzheimer's potential of these isolated compounds, which showed a good binding ability to diseases and related proteins. However, the binding energy and docking fraction of ellagic acid, tiliroside, and kaempferol-3-o-rutoside were better than those of gallic acid, ferulic acid and vanillic acid. Additionally, by studying the effects of these six phenolic components on the LPS-induced secretion of inflammatory mediators in murine microglial (BV2) cells, it was further demonstrated that they were all capable of inhibiting the secretion of NO, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 to a certain extent. However, ellagic acid, tiliroside, and kaempferol-3-o-rutoside have better inhibitory effects compared to others. The results obtained suggest that the phenolic components extracted from ethyl acetate extracts of raspberry by molecularly imprinted polymers have the potential to inhibit the progression of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The red raspberry is one of the world's most popular berries. The main direction of its breeding has switched to nutritional quality, and the evaluation of raspberry germplasm for antioxidant content and activity is very important. As berries, raspberry leaves contain valuable bioactive compounds, but the optimal time for their collection is unknown. We evaluated 25 new breeding lines and standard raspberry cultivars for their polyphenolic content and antioxidant capacity. The antioxidant activity of berries correlated better with the content of total phenolics (0.88 and 0.92) and flavonoids (0.76 and 0.88) than with anthocyanins (0.37 and 0.66). Two breeding lines were significantly superior to the standard cultivars and can be used in further breeding. Leaves collected in three phenological phases of the raspberry contained more phenolics (5.4-fold) and flavonoids (4.1-fold) and showed higher antioxidant activities (2.4-fold in FRAP assay, 2.2-fold in ABTS) than berries. The optimal time for harvesting raspberry leaves is the fruit ripening stage, with exceptions for some cultivars. Genetic diversity analysis using microsatellite (SSR) markers from flavonoid biosynthesis genes divided the genotypes into five clusters, generally in agreement with their kinships. The relationship between genetic data based on metabolism-specific SSR markers and the chemical diversity of cultivars was first assessed. The biochemical and genetic results show a strong correlation (0.78). This study is useful for further the improvement of raspberry and other berry crops.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess and improve the oxidative stability of red raspberry seed oil\u2212RO, a potential topical ingredient derived from food industry by-products, on its own and when incorporated in low energy nanoemulsion (NE). The RO\u2019s oxidative stability was assessed at 5, 25, and 40 \u00b0C during one month of storage and expressed in: peroxide value, p-anisidine, and thiobarbituric reactive substances\u2014TBARS value, while for NEs, lipid hydroperoxides and TBARS values were monitored. Both synthetic (butylated hydroxytoluene\u2014BHT and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\u2014EDTA), and natural (oregano essential oil\u2014ORE and oak fruit extract\u2014OAK) antioxidants were used. Pure RO and RO with BHT or ORE were stable at 5 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C, but at 40 \u00b0C BHT showed only moderate protection, while ORE was prooxidant. NEs prepared with new biodegradable polyglycerol esters-based surfactants, with droplet sizes of < 50 nm and narrow size distribution, showed improved physicochemical stability at room temperature, and especially at 40 \u00b0C, compared to NEs with polysorbate 80, which required the addition of antioxidants to preserve their stability. Natural antioxidants ORE and OAK were compatible with all NEs; therefore, their use is proposed as an effective alternative to synthetic antioxidants.",

    "abstract": "Adiabatic temperature rise is an important method for determining isocyanate conversion in polyurethane foam reactions as well as many other exothermic chemical reactions. Adiabatic temperature rise can be used in conjunction with change in height and mass measurements to gain understanding into the blowing and gelling reactions that occur during polyurethane foaming as well as give important information on cell morphology. FoamPi is an open-source Raspberry Pi device for monitoring polyurethane foaming reactions. The device effectively monitors temperature rise, change in foam height as well as changes in the mass during the reaction. Three Python scripts are also presented. The first logs raw data during the reaction. The second corrects temperature data such that it can be used in adiabatic temperature rise reactions for calculating isocyanate conversion; additionally this script reduces noise in all the data and removes erroneous readings. The final script extracts important information from the corrected data such as maximum temperature change and maximum height change as well as the time to reach these points. Commercial examples of such equipment exist however the price (>\u00a310000) of these equipment make these systems inaccessible for many research laboratories. The FoamPi build presented is inexpensive (\u00a3350) and test examples are shown here to indicate the reproducibility of results as well as precision of the FoamPi.",

    "abstract": "In temperate climates, there has been an increasing interest by fruit growers to implement the use of high tunnels, using a variety of coverings, to extend the season for fruit production. High tunnels also provide an opportunity to enhance insect pest management, via physical exclusion, and thus support reductions in insecticide use. Due to increasing pest pressure by the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman, in Midwest U.S. raspberry, a 3-year study (2017\u22122019) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of selected high tunnel coverings to suppress adult beetle populations and minimize adult feeding injury. During each year of the study, P. japonica adult beetles were significantly reduced under poly-based coverings, with the ends open, and when a fine, nylon-mesh was used to cover the ends (p < 0.05). The poly-based covering also resulted in moderately higher ambient temperatures, which may have influenced beetle movement, including a \u201crepellency effect\u201d that encouraged beetles to exit the high tunnel structures. Although P. japonica adults are known to feed on raspberry flower clusters, including fruit, the majority (73\u221292%) of beetle feeding in this study was observed on the foliage. The impact of high tunnels on P. japonica are discussed within the context of developing sustainable Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs for raspberry production.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the implementation and testing of a modular software for multichannel control of Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). Moving towards an embedded scenario, the core of the system is a Raspberry Pi, whose different models (with different computing powers) best suit two different system use-cases: user-supervised and stand-alone. Given the need for real-time and reliable FES applications, software processing timings were analyzed for multiple configurations, along with hardware resources utilization. Among the results, the simultaneous use of eight channels has been functionally achieved (0% lost packets) while minimizing system timing failures (excessive processing latency). Further investigations included stressing the system using more constraining acquisition parameters, eventually limiting the usable channels (only for the stand-alone use-case).",

Owing to its unique three-dimensional spherical raspberry structure, NiCo-MOF-3 demonstrates an available internal resistance and electron transfer resistance to ameliorate electrical energy storage, exhibiting an excellent mass specific capacitance of 639.8 F/g at 1 A/g.

    "abstract": "Materials with super-wetting ability have attracted wide attention from both academia and industry due to their great potential applications. A straightforward and versatile route was proposed for the large-scale synthesis of a monodisperse raspberry-like metal-organic framework (ZIF-8) using zinc nitrate as a zinc source and dimethylimidazole as an organic ligand in aqueous solution. After hydrophobic treatment with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane, the ethanolic suspension of three-dimensional raspberry-like ZIF-8 showed excellent superhydrophobic properties. Furthermore, commercial adhesives were used to blend with the suspension to improve the bonding strength to different substrates. These surfaces retained their water resistance after 50 finger-wipe cycles, 40 sandpaper abrasions and knife scratches. Moreover, the prepared hydrophobic surface can withstand the impact of water flow for 10 minutes. The formulations developed can be used for superhydrophobic coating applications on different substrate surfaces such as aluminum foil, glass, paper and cotton.",

    "abstract": "The fruit juice industry generates pomace as a valuable by-product especially rich in polyphenols, dietary fibers, vitamins, minerals, and unsaturated fatty acids. In the cookies used in this study, 30% of the gluten-free flour was replaced with dried and ground blueberry and raspberry pomace, rich source of polyphenols, dietary fibers, linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid. In order to examine whether the addition of blueberry and raspberry pomace in cookie formulation can have beneficial effects on certain blood parameters and anthropometric measurements, the designed cookies were tested in 20 healthy, normally fed female subjects, aged 30-50 years (41.35 \u00b1 8.58 years) over four-week dietetic intervention study. Significant changes in the composition of fatty acids serum phospholipids, decrease in LDL-cholesterol level (20.16%), increase in adiponectin level (25.52%) and decrease in ALT and AST values were observed, thus indicating that inclusion of cookies containing blueberry and raspberry dried and ground pomace to usual diet might have positive effects on certain cardiovascular risk factors and liver function indicators.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal acetylation modification is a common epigenetic change in tumorigenesis and is closely related to the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Our previous studies have suggested that black raspberry (BRB) anthocyanins have a significant chemopreventive effect against CRC. This study investigated whether protein acetylation plays an important role in BRB anthocyanins-mediated regulation of CRC progression.\nWe used the AOM-induced CRC mouse model and the CRC cell lines SW480 and Caco-2 to explore the potential role of acetylation of histone H4 and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway-related proteins (non-histone proteins) in the antitumor process mediated by BRB anthocyanins. The expression of related proteins was detected by western blot. ROS level was detected by immunofluorescence.\nBRB anthocyanins affected the acetylation level by down-regulating the expression of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and up-regulating the expression of MOF and EP300. The acetylation level of lysine sites on histone H4 (H4K5, H4K12 and H4K16) was increased. Furthermore, following BRB anthocyanins treatment, the expression of ac-p65 was significantly up-regulated and the NF-\u03baB signal pathway was activated, which in turn up-regulated Bax expression and inhibited Bcl-2, cyclin-D1, c-myc and NLRP3 expression to promote CRC cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and relieve inflammation.\nThe findings suggested that protein acetylation could play a critical role in BRB anthocyanins-regulated CRC development.",

    "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are one of the most diagnosed malignancies globally, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 40% to 50%. Current therapies are limited to highly invasive surgery, aggressive radiation, and chemotherapies. Recent reports have demonstrated the potential phytochemical properties of black raspberries in inhibiting the progression of various cancers including HNSCCs. However, the effects of black raspberry extracts on immune cells of the tumor microenvironment, specifically regulatory T cells during HNSCC, have not been investigated. We used a mouse model of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) chemically induced HNSCC carcinogenesis to determine these effects. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 4NQO for 16 weeks and regular water for 8 weeks. 4NQO-exposed mice were fed the AIN-76A control mouse diet or the AIN76 diet supplemented with black raspberry extract. At terminal sacrifice, tumor burdens and immune cell recruitment and activity were analyzed in the tumor microenvironment, draining lymph nodes, and spleens. Mice fed the BRB extract-supplemented diet displayed decreased tumor burden compared to mice provided the AIN-76A control diet. Black raspberry extract administration did not affect overall T-cell populations as well as Th1, Th2, or Th17 differentiation in spleens and tumor draining lymph nodes. However, dietary black raspberry extract administration inhibited regulatory T-cell recruitment to HNSCC tumor sites. This was associated with an increased cytotoxic immune response in the tumor microenvironment characterized by increased CD8",

    "abstract": "Dense stroma and an immunosuppressive microenvironment severely hamper the antitumor therapeutic results of pancreatic cancer. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) support the proliferation and invasion of tumor cells and contribute to the information of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). The repolarization of TAMs activates the antitumor immune response and sensitizes chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the difference in distributed mode between TAMs and tumor cells in tumor turns out to be an obstacle for dual targeting. To repolarize TAMs and elevate the chemoimmunotherapy outcome against pancreatic cancer, co-loading the TME responsive micellar system with gemcitabine (GEM) and PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (Wtmn) was used to dual target TAMs and tumor cells. GEM conjugated dendritic poly-lysine DGL (GD) nanoparticles were linked to polycaprolactone-polyethylene glycol micelles encapsulated with Wtmn (PP/Wtmn) ",

    "abstract": "Black and red raspberries are fruits with a high phenolic and vitamin C content but are highly susceptible to deterioration. The effect of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP 400\u2212600 MPa/CUT-10 min) and pulsed electric fields (PEF, frequency 100\u2212500 Hz, pulse number 100, electric field strength from 11.3 to 23.3 kV/cm, and specific energy from 19.7 to 168.4 kJ/L) processes on black/red raspberry juice was studied. The effect on the inactivation of microorganisms and pectin methylesterase (PME) activity, physicochemical parameters (pH, acidity, total soluble solids (\u00b0Brix), and water activity (aw)), vitamin C and phenolic compounds content were also determined. Results reveal that all HHP-treatments produced the highest (p < 0.05) log-reduction of molds (log 1.85 to 3.72), and yeast (log 3.19), in comparison with PEF-treatments. Increments in pH, acidity, and TSS values attributed to compounds\u2019 decompartmentalization were found. PME activity was partially inactivated by HHP-treatment at 600 MPa/10 min (22% of inactivation) and PEF-treatment at 200 Hz/168.4 kJ/L (19% of inactivation). Increment in vitamin C and TPC was also observed. The highest increment in TPC (79% of increment) and vitamin C (77% of increment) was observed with PEF at 200 Hz/168.4 kJ/L. The putative effect of HHP and PEF on microbial safety, enzyme inactivation, and phytochemical retention is also discussed in detail. In conclusion, HHP and PEF improve phytochemical compounds\u2019 content, microbial safety, and quality of black/red raspberry juice.",

In total, 22 strains were isolated: 16 from symptomatic raspberry shoots, 2 from asymptomatic raspberry leaves, and 4 from symptomatic blackberry shoots. Additionally, eight raspberry strains, isolated earlier from two similar outbreaks, were included in the study. Pathogenicity of the strains was confirmed on detached raspberry and blackberry shoots by reproducing the symptoms of natural infection. The strains were Gram-negative, fluorescent on King's medium B, ice nucleation positive, and utilized glucose oxidatively. All strains were levan positive, oxidase negative, nonpectolytic, arginine dihydrolase negative, and induced hypersensitivity in tobacco leaves (LOPAT + - - - +, ",

    "abstract": "Raspberry-shaped particles have attracted increasing interest due to their tunable surface morphologies and physicochemical properties. A variety of covalent and noncovalent strategies have been developed for the fabrication of raspberry-shaped particles. However, most of these strategies are complex or require precise control of solution conditions. In this work, we develop a direct approach for the fabrication of noncovalent raspberry-shaped microgels. Our strategy works through the electrostatically driven heterocoagulation of binary microgels with complementary functional groups at the oil-water interface. By introducing hexanoic acid (HA) into the oil phase, stable inverse water-in-oil (w/o) Pickering emulsions could be stabilized solely by HA-swollen microgels or self-assembled raspberry-shaped microgels. Furthermore, the formation mechanism and the interfacial properties of interfaces laden with raspberry-shaped microgels were investigated. The results indicate that HA can effectively improve the hydrophobicity and interfacial activity of microgels. In addition, raspberry-shaped microgels achieve high coverage on the droplet surface, resulting in the elastic interface and excellent stability of emulsions. We envision that these results will not only fill a knowledge gap in the field of soft matter interfacial self-assembly, but also will shed light on the rational design of raspberry-shaped soft colloids and the on-demand control of interfacial rheology. In addition, we expect that our results will contribute to wider applications of microgel-stabilized emulsions, including cascade catalysis, microreactor, and in vivo drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "The Raspberry Pi is a credit card sized single board computer that finds its use in very diverse projects. Being a computer it runs on a full operating system and can be interfaced with a wide range of hardware. Its ability to collect and store data and its superior processing capabilities gives it an edge over other microprocessors. When used to collect data away from the grid, alternative methods of powering the Raspberry Pi have to be used. An ideal powering system should be autonomous, allowing the Raspberry Pi to be deployed indefinitely without the need to check on the system due to power shortcomings. In this paper we introduce the DSAIL Power Management Board that is used to power the Raspberry Pi autonomously. We have developed a prototype and used it to collect ecological data from a conservancy in Central Kenya.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify ellagitannins in black raspberry seeds (BRS) and to optimize accelerated solvent extraction of ellagitannins using an artificial neural network (ANN) coupled with genetic algorithm. Fifteen monomeric and dimeric ellagitannins were identified in BRS. For ANN modeling, extraction time, extraction temperature, and solvent concentration were set as input variables, and total ellagitannin content was set as output variable. The trained ANN had a mean squared error value of 0.0102 and a regression correlation coefficient of 0.9988. The predicted optimal extraction conditions for maximum total ellagitannin content were 63.7% acetone, 4.21\u00a0min, and 43.9\u00a0\u00b0C. The actual total ellagitannin content under the optimal extraction conditions was 13.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0\u00a0mg/g dry weight, and the prediction error was 0.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27%. This study is the first attempt to analyze the composition of ellagitannins in BRS and to determine optimal extraction conditions for maximum total ellagitannin content from BRS.",

    "abstract": "Ecological intensification has been proposed as an alternative paradigm for intensive agriculture to boost yield sustainably through utilizing ecosystem services. A prerequisite to achieving this is to understand the relations between multiple ecosystem services and production, while taking growth conditions such as nutrient availability into consideration. Here, we conducted a pot-field experiment to study the interactive effects of soil organic matter (SOM) content and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation on the production of raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) under four levels of fertilizer application. Raspberry flower number, fruit number and yield only significantly increased with fertilizer inputs but were not impacted by SOM content or AMF inoculation. Fruit set and single berry weight were influenced by both SOM content and AMF inoculation, in complex three-way interactions with fertilizer application. Fruit set of AMF inoculated plants increased with fertilizer inputs in low SOM soils, but decreased with fertilizer inputs under high SOM soils, with the highest fruit set occurring at no fertilizer inputs. In low SOM soils, the relation between single berry weight and fertilizer application was more pronounced in inoculated plants than in non-inoculated plants, while in high SOM soils the relative benefits of AMF inoculation on single berry weight decreased with increasing fertilizer inputs. We attribute the lack of effects of AMF inoculation and SOM content on flower number, fruit number and yield mainly to potential tradeoffs between the experimental variables that all influence resource uptake by plant root systems. Our results suggest that potentially beneficial effects of AMF and SOM can be offset by each other, probably driven by the dynamic relations between AMF and the host plants. The findings reveal fundamental implications for managing AMF inoculation and SOM management simultaneously in real-world agricultural systems.",

    "abstract": "Heterocrossa rubophaga (raspberry bud moth) feed on a range of Rubus species, including commercial berryfruit crops where they are a pest. This study aimed to characterize the responses of native and non-native Rubus species to feeding by raspberry bud moth larvae. In a laboratory environment, in situ headspace volatiles of three Rubus species were collected from healthy plants and those fed upon by raspberry bud moth. Rubus cissoides (bush lawyer), the native host of raspberry bud moth, gave a limited response to larval feeding with green leaf volatiles (GLVs) representing the only new headspace constituents of the infested plants. The non-native hosts, Rubus ursinus var. loganobaccus cv Boysenberry (Boysenberry), and Rubus fruticosus (blackberry), gave strong responses to raspberry bud moth herbivory, releasing a number of unique nitrogenous compounds in conjunction with the GLVs. The nitrogenous compounds were identified as 2-methylbutanenitrile, (Z)- and (E)- 2-methylbutanal O-methyloxime, benzyl nitrile, (Z)- and (E)- phenylacetaldehyde O-methyloxime and indole. The four methyloximes and 2-methylbutanenitrile were confirmed by synthesis. Field collected phenology data showed that raspberry bud moth were active year round on both bush lawyer and blackberry.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberry serves as a proven natural product to produce anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer functions, but limited findings are available on its effects on depression. This study, by using a chronic unpredictable mild stress- (CUMS-) induced depression model, thus investigated the effects and underlying mechanism of red raspberry extract (RRE) on depressive behavior, inflammation, and oxidative stress.\nDifferent treatments were given after random grouping of Sprague-Dawley rats, including no intervention (control), CUMS induction, and CUMS+different concentrations of RRE, and subsequently, depression-like behavior tests were performed. HE staining was designed to observe the pathological damage of the hippocampal tissue in rats. The levels of oxidative stress, endocrine hormones, and inflammatory factors were determined by biochemical assay and ELISA, and gene expression (mRNA and protein) in the hippocampal tissue by qRT-PCR and Western blot.\nOn completion of CUMS treatment, the rats showed severe depression-like behavior, with obvious hippocampal tissue damage, oxidative inflammatory response, and endocrine imbalance. Importantly, RRE treatment significantly improved such depression-like behavior and attenuated histopathological damage in CUMS rats when reducing inflammation and oxidative stress and endocrine imbalance with upregulation of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and interleukin- (IL-) 10 and downregulation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone (CORT), malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1\nBy regulating neuroinflammation, oxidative stress response, endocrine level, and BDNF/TrkB level, RRE showed potential efficacy in alleviating depression-like behavior and histopathological damage of hippocampal tissue in CUMS rats by regulating the GSK3",

    "abstract": "The Internet of things concept empowered by low-cost sensor technologies and headless computers has upscaled the applicability of vibration monitoring systems in recent years. Raspberry Shake devices are among those systems, constituting a crowdsourcing framework and forming a worldwide seismic network of over a thousand nodes. While Raspberry Shake devices have been proven to densify seismograph arrays efficiently, their potential for structural health monitoring (SHM) is still unknown and is open to discovery. This paper presents recent findings from existing buildings located in Bucharest (Romania) equipped with Raspberry Shake 4D (RS4D) devices, whose signal recorded under multiple seismic events has been analyzed using different modal identification algorithms. The obtained results show that RS4D modules can capture the building vibration behavior despite the short-duration and low-amplitude excitation sources. Based on 15 RS4D device readings from five different multistorey buildings, the results do not indicate damage in terms of modal frequency decay. The findings of this research propose a baseline for future seismic events that can track the changes in vibration characteristics as a consequence of future strong earthquakes. In summary, this research presents multi-device, multi-testbed, and multi-algorithm evidence on the feasibility of RS4D modules as SHM instruments, which are yet to be explored in earthquake engineering.",

    "abstract": "High-precision data acquisition (DAQ) is essential for developing new methods in the plant sciences. Commercial high-resolution DAQ systems are cost prohibitive, whereas the less expensive systems that are currently available lack the resolution and precision required for many physiological measurements.\nWe developed the software libraries, called piadcs, and hardware design for a DAQ system based on an ultra-high-resolution analog-to-digital converter and a Raspberry Pi computer. We tested the system precision with and without a thermocouple attached and found the precision with the sensor to be better than \u00b10.01\u00b0C and the maximum possible system resolution to be 0.4\u2009ppm.\nThe ultra-high-resolution DAQ system described here is inexpensive, flexible enough to be used with many different sensors, and can be built by researchers with rudimentary electronic and computer skills. This system is most applicable in the development of new measurement techniques and the improvement of existing methods.",

    "abstract": "A steadily increasing number of citizen seismological stations, often located in populated areas, record a plethora of man-made events. These events are especially of interest, when they are caused by criminal activity or man-made explosions. On 4 December 2021, during an attempted robbery of an automated teller machine (ATM) in Bonn-R\u00f6ttgen, Germany, the burglars used explosions. The seismic effects of the explosions were recorded with a Raspberry Shake (RS) station at a distance of 580\u00a0m from the site. While working on the analysis of this signal, another attack on an ATM on 23 February 2022 in K\u00fcrten-D\u00fcrscheid was recorded by another RS station, this time at 830-m distance with an instrument that also included an air pressure channel. The seismic signatures of both events indicate similar procedures in both cases whereby a larger explosion was quickly followed a smaller explosion after 21\u00a0s and 49\u00a0s, respectively. An estimate of the charge weight of the explosions shows that ratios of the strength of the first to second explosion were 21:1 and 9.4:1 in the R\u00f6ttgen and D\u00fcrscheid attacks, respectively.",

    "abstract": "A seismograph was designed based on Raspberry Pi. Although comprising 8 channels, the seismograph can be expanded to 16, 24, or 32 channels by using a USB interfacing with a microcontroller. In addition, by clustering more than one Raspberry Pi, the number of possible channels can be extended beyond 32. In this study, we also explored the computational intelligence of Raspberry Pi for running real-time systems and multithreaded algorithms to process raw seismic data. Also integrated into the seismograph is a Huawei MH5000-31 5G module, which provided high-speed internet real-time operations. Other hardware peripherals included a 24 bit ADS1251 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a STM32F407 microcontroller. Real-time data were acquired in the field for ambient noise tomography. An analysis tool called spatial autocorrelation (SPAC) was used to analyze the data, followed by inversion, which revealed the subsurface velocity of the site location. The proposed seismograph is prospective for small, medium, or commercial data acquisition. In accordance with the processing power and stability of Raspberry Pi, which were confirmed in this study, the proposed seismograph is also recommended as a template for developing high-performance computing applications, such as artificial intelligence (AI) in seismology and other related disciplines.",

    "abstract": "The use of rain shelters and reflective groundcovers has been shown to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of organic fruit crops prone to rain-driven epidemics of phytopathogens. Here, we tested whether these structures affect communities of epigean species. To this end, we studied rain shelters and white, synthetic reflective groundcovers placed in a red raspberry organic cropping system in New Brunswick, Canada, during two subsequent summers to assess their independent and combined effects on ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae). 18,445 ground beetles belonging to 54 species were collected. Rain shelters and reflective groundcovers altered patterns of ground beetle species richness, activity density and functional diversity compared to the control, but to a limited extent. Thus, this study suggests that these structures, which have known benefits against phytopathogens, have no detrimental impact on epigean fauna.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a global health problem and a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Exercise is an effective intervention to combat obesity. Fibronectin type III domain containing protein 5 (FNDC5)/irisin, a myokine, can stimulate the browning of white adipose tissue by increasing uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression, and therefore may represent a link between the beneficial effects of exercise and improvement in metabolic diseases. Thus, upregulating the endogenous expression of FNDC5/irisin by administering medication would be a good approach for treating obesity. Herein, we evaluated the efficacy of raspberry ketone (RK) in inducing FNDC5/irisin expression and the underlying mechanisms. The expression of brown fat-specific proteins (PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), CD137, and UCP1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), FNDC5, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1\u03b1) in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocyte was analyzed by western blotting or immunofluorescence. The level of irisin in the culture medium was also assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Results showed that RK (50 \u03bcM) significantly induced the upregulation of FNDC5 protein in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes; however, the irisin level in the culture media was unaffected. Moreover, RK significantly increased the levels of PGC1\u03b1, brown adipocyte markers (PRDM16, CD137, and UCP1), and HO-1. Furthermore, the upregulation of PGC1\u03b1 and FNDC5 and the browning effect induced by RK were significantly reduced by SnPP or FNDC5 siRNA, respectively. In conclusion, RK can induce FNDC5 protein expression via the HO-1 signaling pathway, and this study provides new evidence for the potential use of RK in the treatment of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Increased cardiac inflammation and oxidative stress are common features in obesity, and toll-like receptor (TLR)4 signaling is a key inflammatory pathway in this deleterious process. This study aimed to investigate whether berries could attenuate the detrimental effects of a high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet on the myocardium at the molecular level.\nEight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice consumed a low-fat, low-sucrose (LFLS) diet\u00a0alone or supplemented with 10% blackberry (BL), 10% raspberry (RB) or 10% blackberry\u00a0+\u00a0raspberry (BL\u00a0+\u00a0RB) for four weeks. Animals were then switched to a HFHS diet for 24 weeks with or without berry supplementation or maintained on a LFLS control diet without berry supplementation. Left ventricles of the heart were isolated for protein and mRNA analysis. Berry consumption, particularly BL\u00a0+\u00a0RB reduced NADPH-oxidase (NOX)1 and NOX2 and increased catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)2, expression while BL and RB supplementation alone was less efficacious. Downstream TLR4 signaling was attenuated mostly by both RB and BL\u00a0+\u00a0RB supplementation, while NF-\u03baB pathway was attenuated by BL\u00a0+\u00a0RB supplementation. Stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) was also attenuated by BL\u00a0+\u00a0RB supplementation, and reduced TNF-\u03b1 transcription and protein expression was observed only with BL\u00a0+\u00a0RB supplementation.\nThe synergistic effects of BL\u00a0+\u00a0RB may reduce obesity-induced cardiac inflammation and oxidative stress to a greater extent than BL or RB alone.",

Blood and stool samples were collected at weeks 0 and 8. Inter-individual variability in plasma TMAO levels was analyzed, 7 subjects were excluded due to noninformative signals and 17 subjects were kept for analysis and further stratified according to their TMAO response. Whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing analysis was used to determine the impact of raspberry consumption on gut microbial composition.

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that the gut microbiota and cardiometabolic status are associated, suggesting dietary interventions that alter the microbiota may affect metabolic health.\nWe investigated whether supplementation with (poly)phenol-dense red raspberries (RRB), alone or with a fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) prebiotic, would improve biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk in individuals with prediabetes (PreDM) and insulin resistance (IR) and whether the effects are related to modulation of the gut microbiota.\nAdults with PreDM-IR (n\u00a0=\u00a026; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM age, 35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 years; fasting glucose, 5.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0mmol/L; HOMA-IR, 3.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3) or who were metabolically healthy (reference group; n\u00a0=\u00a010; age, 31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 years; fasting glucose, 5.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mmol/L; HOMA-IR, 1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1) participated in a randomized crossover trial with two 4-week supplementation periods, in which they consumed either RRB (125\u00a0g fresh equivalents) daily or RRB\u00a0+\u00a08g\u00a0FOS daily, separated by a 4-week washout. The primary outcome variable was the change in the gut microbiota composition, assessed by shotgun sequencing before (baseline) and at the end of each supplementation period. Secondary outcomes were changes in glucoregulation, lipid metabolism, anti-inflammatory status, and anthropometry. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03049631.\nIn PreDM-IR, RRB supplementation reduced hepatic-IR (-30.1%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.6%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and reduced plasma total and LDL cholesterol [-4.9%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and -7.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003), respectively] from baseline. Adding FOS (RRB\u00a0+\u00a0FOS) improved \u03b2-cell function [insulin secretion rate, +70.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a032.8% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02); Disposition Index, +94.4%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050.2% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04)], but had no significant effect on plasma cholesterol compared to baseline. RRB increased Eubacterium eligens (2-fold) and decreased Ruminococcus gnavus (-60%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034%), whereas RRB\u00a0+\u00a0FOS increased Bifidobacterium spp. (4-fold) and decreased Blautia wexlerae (-23%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012%) from baseline (all P values \u2264\u00a00.05). R. gnavus was positively correlated with hepatic-IR, and E. eligens and Bifidobacterium catenulatum were negatively correlated with cholesterol concentrations (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05).\nIncreased Bifidobacterium spp., concurrently with reduced R. gnavus, was associated with metabolic improvements in adults with PreDM-IR, warranting further research on the mechanisms involved in (poly)phenol/FOS-microbial interactions with host metabolism.",

    "abstract": "We report a case of a 48-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with pelvic/abdominal pain and a recent history of irregular periods. Pelvic ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis revealed a 7.3\u00a0cm adnexal mass with suspicious features. During the intraoperative evaluation, a frozen section slide and a cytological smear were prepared. The cytological preparation was moderately cellular, showing cohesive groups of atypical cells with anisonucleosis, high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, and oval nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The tumor cells surrounded extracellular, magenta hyaline globules, forming raspberry bodies. Raspberry bodies are comprised of basement membrane deposits and are a unique finding in ovarian clear cell carcinoma. Raspberry bodies were also found in the frozen section slide, but, in comparison to the cytological preparation, were rare, difficult to identify, and resembled necrotic debris. The intraoperative diagnosis of a clear cell carcinoma is important because the surgical management will be more aggressive, as optimal tumor debulking is shown to have better overall survival. In this manuscript, we detail the intraoperative evaluation of an ovarian mass, the utility of cytological preparation and importance of identifying raspberry bodies in the evaluation of ovarian masses, and surgical management of clear cell carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Industrial processing of raspberry juice and wine generates considerable byproducts of raspberry pomace. Ellagic acids/ellagitannins, being characterized by their antioxidant and antiproliferation properties, constitute the majority of polyphenolics in the pomace and are valuable for recovery. In the present study, we developed a novel procedure with sodium bicarbonate assisted extraction (SBAE) to recover ellagic acid from raspberry wine pomace. Key parameters in the procedure, i.e., sodium bicarbonate concentration, temperature, time and solid/liquid (S/L) ratio, were investigated by single factor analysis and optimized subsequently by Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Optimal parameters for the SBAE method here were found to be 1.2% (",

    "abstract": "A powerful, yet low-cost and semi-portable electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensing device is described. It is constructed around a Raspberry Pi single-board computer, which serves as the controller and user interface. The Pi is interfaced with an expansion board that controls the potential applied to a disposable screen-printed electrode and facilitates data acquisition from a photomultiplier tube (PMT), which detects the ECL emission from the sensor surface. As proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that this arrangement can quantitate tris(2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) ([Ru(bpy)",

    "abstract": "U.S. black raspberry (BR) production is currently limited by narrowly adapted, elite germplasm. An improved understanding of genetic control and the stability of pomological traits will inform the development of improved BR germplasm and cultivars. To this end, the analysis of a multiple-environment trial of a BR mapping population derived from a cross that combines wild ancestors introgressed with commercial cultivars on both sides of its pedigree has provided insights into genetic variation, genotype-by-environment interactions, quantitative trait loci (QTL), and QTL-by-environment interactions (QEI) of fruit quality traits among diverse field environments. The genetic components and stability of four fruit size traits and six fruit biochemistry traits were characterized in this mapping population following their evaluation over three years at four distinct locations representative of current U.S. BR production. This revealed relatively stable genetic control of the four fruit size traits across the tested production environments and less stable genetic control of the fruit biochemistry traits. Of the fifteen total QTL, eleven exhibited significant QEI. Closely overlapping QTL revealed the linkage of several fruit size traits: fruit mass, drupelet count, and seed fraction. These and related findings are expected to guide further genetic characterization of BR fruit quality, management of breeding germplasm, and development of improved BR cultivars for U.S. production.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between sleep posture and sleep quality has been studied comprehensively. Over 70% of chronic diseases are highly correlated with sleep problems. However, sleep posture monitoring requires professional devices and trained nursing staff in a medical center. This paper proposes a contactless sleep-monitoring Internet of Things (IoT) system that is equipped with a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B; radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags are embedded in bed sheets as part of a low-cost and low-power microsystem. Random forest classification (RFC) is used to recognize sleep postures, which are then uploaded to the server database via Wi-Fi and displayed on a terminal. The experimental results obtained using RFC were compared to those obtained via the support vector machine (SVM) method and the multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm to validate the performance of the proposed system. The developed system can be also applied for sleep self-management at home and wireless sleep monitoring in medical wards.",

    "abstract": "Rubus idaeus L. (red raspberry), is a perennial woody plant species of the Rosaceae family that is widely cultivated in the temperate regions of world and is thus an economically important soft fruit species. It is prized for its flavour and aroma, as well as a high content of healthful compounds such as vitamins and antioxidants. Breeding programs exist globally for red raspberry, but variety development is a long and challenging process. Genomic and molecular tools for red raspberry are valuable resources for breeding. Here, a chromosome-length genome sequence assembly and related gene predictions for the red raspberry cultivar 'Anitra' are presented, comprising PacBio long read sequencing scaffolded using Hi-C sequence data. The assembled genome sequence totalled 291.7 Mbp, with 247.5 Mbp (84.8%) incorporated into seven sequencing scaffolds with an average length of 35.4 Mbp. A total of 39,448 protein-coding genes were predicted, 75% of which were functionally annotated. The seven chromosome scaffolds were anchored to a previously published genetic linkage map with a high degree of synteny and comparisons to genomes of closely related species within the Rosoideae revealed chromosome-scale rearrangements that have occurred over relatively short evolutionary periods. A chromosome-level genomic sequence of R. idaeus will be a valuable resource for the knowledge of its genome structure and function in red raspberry and will be a useful and important resource for researchers and plant breeders.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the norovirus (NoV) surrogate bacteriophage MS2 transfer from stainless steel, glass and low-density polypropylene surfaces to raspberry and pitanga fruits. The effect of sodium hypochlorite (100\u00a0ppm, 1\u00a0min) on MS2 survival on whole fruits, the MS2 survival in sanitized fruits and derived pulps during frozen storage, and in response to preservation technologies (heat, organic acids and salts) was also assessed. The highest (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) viral transfer (%) was observed from glass and stainless steel (\u223c90%) to raspberry, and from glass and polypropylene (\u223c75%) to pitanga, after 60\u00a0min of contact. Sodium hypochlorite reduced (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) MS2 titer by 3.5 and 3.8 log PFU/g in raspberry and pitanga, respectively. MS2 decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) up to 1.4 log PFU/g in frozen stored sanitized fruits (whole fruits and pulps) after 15 days, with no further changes after 30 days. Thermal treatments reduced MS2 titer (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in both fruit pulps. MS2 inactivation was higher in pitanga pulp. The addition of ascorbic acid, citric acid, sodium benzoate, or sodium metabisulfite had little effect (<1 log PFU/g) on MS2 concentration in either fruit. These results may inform NoV risk management practice in processing and handling of fruits.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of safe and effective plant polysaccharides with immunomodulatory effects has become a research hotspot. Raspberry is an essential commercial fruit and is widely distributed, cultivated, and consumed worldwide. In the present study, a homogeneous acidic polysaccharide (RPP-2a), with a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 55582 Da, was isolated from the pulp of raspberries through DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephadex G-200 chromatography. RPP-2a consisted of rhamnose, arabinose, galactose, glucose, xylose, galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid, with a molar ratio of 15.4:9.6:7.6:3.2:9.1:54.3:0.8. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS), 1D-, and 2D-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses suggested that the backbone of RPP-2a was primarily composed of \u21922)-",

    "abstract": "High accuracy and a real-time system are priorities in the development of a prosthetic hand. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a real-time embedded time-domain feature extraction and machine learning on a system on chip (SoC) Raspberry platform using a multi-thread algorithm to operate a prosthetic hand device. The contribution of this study is that the implementation of the multi-thread in the pattern recognition improves the accuracy and decreases the computation time in the SoC. In this study, ten healthy volunteers were involved. The EMG signal was collected by using two dry electrodes placed on the wrist flexor and wrist extensor muscles. To reduce the complexity, four time-domain features were applied to extract the EMG signal. Furthermore, these features were used as the input of the machine learning. The machine learning evaluated in this study were ",

    "abstract": "Defatted raspberry seeds were used as an alternative source of antioxidants and ellagic acid (EA) extracted using Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES). In the preliminary study, the best NADES combination (citric acid-betaine) and the most influential variables (temperature, time, and NADES/plant ratio) were selected for the further optimization process. All samples were analyzed in terms of total polyphenol, EA content, and antioxidant activity. Two sets of optimal conditions were generated by response surface methodology. The first set (Opt1) was designed for higher conversion of ellagitannins to EA while the latter set (Opt2) for higher EA content/100 g extract. Opt1 and Opt2 had higher values for all investigated responses compared to 80% ethanolic extract but had a lower conversion rate of ellagitannins to EA compared to acidified methanol extract. The third set of parameters (Opt3) selected beyond the initial experimental domain was used to obtain a sample with the highest EA content/100 g extract. Due to their nature, NADES extracts are ready to use and could have various technological roles in products since they are antioxidants, acidifiers, and colorants. NADES raspberry extracts exhibited higher anti-proliferative activity compared to ethanolic extracts in terms of EC",

    "abstract": "Raspberry leaf tea (RLT) is a traditional herb purported to help with many pregnancy-related outcomes including reducing the duration of labour. No experimental data exist to support these claims.\nThis study aims to determine how common use and knowledge of RLT are during pregnancy. It also aims to explore whether it would be possible to recruit women for a trial of raspberry leaf in the future.\nPostnatal women were asked to fill in a survey about their use of RLT during pregnancy, and their knowledge of its purported benefits. They were asked whether they would consider being part of a randomised controlled trial of raspberry leaf in the future.\nOne hundred and twenty-one women completed the survey. Of these, 88 (73%) were aware of herbal tea use in pregnancy and 46 (38%) reported using raspberry leaf during pregnancy. Of all women surveyed, 79% indicated they would be happy to participate in a trial of RLT in pregnancy if they were asked.\nDespite no scientific evidence of the efficacy of RLT in pregnancy, 38% of women surveyed used it during pregnancy. Further studies are required to determine whether the claims made about RLT are correct. Clinicians should base their advice on available evidence.",

    "abstract": "Although a raspberry-like configuration has been long observed in biological processes (e.g., the intimate association between Cajal bodies and B-snurposomes), studies on this morphology are very limited. Raspberry-like droplets created with multiple immiscible liquids are expected to provides an ideal model for such structures in biological systems, including their possible formation mechanism, phase behaviors, and coalescence dynamics.\nUsing three liquid phases, one surfactant and some colloidal particles, raspberry-like droplets containing one large central droplet and multiple protrusions embedded on its surface were successfully created. Confocal microscopy studies were carried out to track their formation and coalescence dynamics. A 2D phase-field model was applied to test the influence of the protrusions in the system.\nThe formation of this raspberry-like morphology involves a partial inversion process, which was predicted by Friberg et al. with numerical simulations but has never been demonstrated experimentally. A two-step coalescence was revealed, where the protrusions merge first and create a capillary bridge, which drives the droplets to coalesce. Increasing the viscosity of the continuous phase can help to prevent the destabilization. These fundamental features of raspberry-like droplets represent an important step toward producing multi-liquid materials with unique functionality, and can potentially illuminate some biological systems and processes.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, plant extracts are used as colorant and antioxidant in meat products. Therefore, the effects of cemen pastes produced using different concentrations (0%, 3%, 4% and 5%) of raspberry water extract (RWE) on past\u0131rma were investigated. RWE was tested to improve the color quality of past\u0131rma and decrease lipid and pigment oxidation during production and storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 150\u00a0days. Increasing RWE concentration in cemen paste reduced pH, TBARS (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and lactic acid bacteria counts (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) of past\u0131rma, while redness values (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increased compared to control sample without extract. The use of RWE contributed to improve sensory attributes of past\u0131rma, and the groups with 4% and 5% RWE had the highest sensory scores. Also, the color and oxidative stabilities of the past\u0131rma containing RWE were maintained better than control during storage period (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The overall results suggested that use of 4.0% or 5.0% RWE as a new additive in cemen paste can be considered an antioxidant and colorant for past\u0131rma processing to prevent color and lipid oxidation.",

    "abstract": "Low-cost analytical solutions built around microcomputers like the Raspberry Pi help to facilitate laboratory investigations in resource limited venues. Here, three camera modules (V1.3 with and without filter, as well as NoIR) that work with this microcomputer were assessed for their suitability in imaging fluorescent DNA following agarose gel electrophoresis. Evaluation of their utility was based on signal-to-noise (SNR) and noise variance metrics that were developed. Experiments conducted with samples were subjected to Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and the amplified products were separated using gel electrophoresis and stained with Midori green. Image analysis revealed the NoIR camera performed the best with SNR and noise variance values of 21.7 and 0.222 respectively. In experiments conducted using UV LED lighting to simulate ethidium bromide (EtBr) excitation, the NoIR and V1.3 with filter removed cameras showed comparable SNR values.",

    "abstract": "A 47-year-old man was referred to our hospital for detailed examination of a gastric polypoid lesion. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a raspberry-like polyp at the gastric body. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed this polypoid lesion to be a gastric adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic submucosal dissection was performed, and histopathological examination revealed that lesion to be a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the neoplasm was positive for MUC5AC and negative for MUC6, CD10, and pepsinogen I, indicating that this lesion was a foveolar-type gastric adenocarcinoma. From about 10 years now, this patient has been undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy almost every year. This lesion was absent until six years ago. Five years ago, a small polypoid lesion appeared at the gastric body, and this lesion gradually enlarged. The present case showed the growing process of the foveolar-type gastric adenocarcinoma with a raspberry-like appearance.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have reported that diets rich in phenolic compounds are beneficial to immune-metabolic health, yet these effects are heterogeneous and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To investigate the inter-individual variability of the immune-metabolic response to raspberry consumption, whole-blood RNAseq data from 24 participants receiving 280 g/d of raspberries for 8 weeks were used for the identification of responsiveness subgroups by using partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLSDA) and hierarchical clustering. Transcriptomic-based clustering regrouped participants into two distinct subgroups of 13 and 11 participants, so-called responders and non-responders, respectively. Following raspberry consumption, a significant decrease in triglycerides, cholesterol and C-reactive protein levels were found in responders, as compared to non-responders. Two major gene expression components of 100 and 220 genes were identified by sparse PLSDA as those better discriminating responders from non-responders, and functional analysis identified pathways related to cytokine production, leukocyte activation and immune response as significantly enriched with most discriminant genes. As compared to non-responders, the plasma lipidomic profile of responders was characterized by a significant decrease in triglycerides and an increase in phosphatidylcholines following raspberry consumption. Prior to the intervention, a distinct metagenomic profile was identified by PLSDA between responsiveness subgroups, and the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidota ratio was found significantly lower in responders, as compared to non-responders. Findings point to this transcriptomic-based clustering approach as a suitable tool to identify distinct responsiveness subgroups to raspberry consumption. This approach represents a promising framework to tackle the issue of inter-individual variability in the understanding of the impact of foods on immune-metabolic health.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical treatments can be simple and feasible methods for enhancing the anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic substrates. This work aims to relate the direct effect of five different mechanical treatments, i.e., variation in the size and number of particles, with the variations in the chemical composition and, subsequently, the effect over the anaerobic digestion of residual raspberry extrudate, which was used as a model substrate. A high variation in the number of particles and the particle size distribution was achieved depending on the mechanical treatment applied, reaching the highest number of particles for the treatments with knife mills and mortar (around 8000 particles per gram). The higher number of particles was related to higher solubilisation, including phenolic compounds and sugars. The combination of knife mills and mortar pretreatment, which presented the highest number of particles, resulted in a 66% more of polyphenols in comparison to the raw substrate. However, the presence of anthocyanins was higher in mechanical treatments with less effect. The enhancement of the anaerobic digestion was clearly related to the increment in the number of particles of small size after the mechanical treatments. The highest methane yield coefficient (236\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0mL CH",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to understand how the addition of pectin (2.5% and 5%) affected the content and bioaccessibility of phenolics in red raspberry puree. The results showed that the concentration of antioxidants in red raspberry puree was reduced with the addition of pectin. Similarly, addition of pectin to red raspberry puree significantly reduced the total phenolic content (15-20%), total antioxidant capacity (18-70%), and total monomeric anthocyanin (25-30%) after in vitro digestion. On the other hand, significant decreases in the bioaccessible amount of cyanidin (41%), cyanidin-3-glucoside (14%), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (17%), pelargonidin 3-glucoside (16%), and peonidin (28%) were observed after the addition of pectin (5% (w/w)) compared to the control (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) as analyzed with the HPLC method. According to the LC-MS/MS analysis of red raspberry samples, five flavonoids (rutin, quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and phlorizin) and six phenolic acids (gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, sinapic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid) were detected. The effect of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion varied depending on the type of the phenolic compounds. Sinapic acid and phlorizin were not detected at all in the intestinal phase, indicating that they were completely degraded during digestion. The percentage bioaccessibility of gallic acid (49-88%), rutin (6-16%), and quercetin (23-33%) was decreased proportionally with the increase in the pectin content in red raspberry purees (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). On the other hand, only 5% pectin addition to red raspberry puree resulted with a significant decrease in the amount of bioaccessible caffeic acid (8% to 5%), kaempferol (24% to 13%), ferulic acid (26% to 10%), and myricetin (91% to 57%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

    "abstract": "Novel food and food compounds interventions have attracted a lot of attention nowadays for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases. Raspberry ketone (RK) is aromatic compound found within red fruits and berries, has been used as an over-the-counter product for weight loss.\u00a0However, actually, the effect of RK on weight loss is still controversial, and the mechanism is largely unknown. Besides, in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated the beneficial effect of RK on the development of other metabolic diseases. In this review, we comprehensively highlighted the synthesis, bioavailability, and metabolism of RK, and summarized the progress made in our understanding of the potential biological activities of RK, including antiobesity, antidiabetes, cardioprotection, and hepatoprotection, as well as their underlying mechanisms. This paper provides a critical overview about the current findings and proposes the future studies in the area of RK on human health. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Raspberry ketone (RK) has been used for weight control for years, but this effect is controversial considering food intake. Additionally, RK is beneficial for T2DM, liver and heart injury. The underlying mechanisms of the protective effect of RK including accelerating fatty acid oxidation, balancing serum glucose level, anti-inflammation, antioxidant process, and so on. In this context, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the benefits of RK against many metabolic diseases and discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms. We hope our work will be helpful for further researches on RK and improve its public recognition.",

    "abstract": "A lab-on-a-tube biosensor was established to rapidly, sensitively and automatically detect foodborne bacteria through a rotatable Halbach magnet to form and rotate magnetic nanobead (MNB) chains for specific isolation of target bacteria, gold@platinum nanocatalysts (Au@PtNCs) to label target bacteria for efficient amplification of detection signal and Raspberry Pi App to collect and analyze the image of catalysate. First, the glass tube was successively preloaded with the mixture of MNBs, sample and Au@PtNCs, the washing buffer (skim milk) and the substrate (hydrogen peroxide-3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine), and they were separated by air gaps. After the tube was placed on the biosensor, the MNB chains were stably formed and continuously rotated using the Halbach magnet and the mixture was moved back and forth using a programmable peristaltic pump, thus making the formation of MNB-bacteria-Au@PtNCs complexes. After the washing buffer was moved to wash the complexes, the substrate was then moved to resuspend the complexes, resulting in the catalytic reaction that changed the color of the substrate. Finally, the catalysate was moved to the designated area, the image of which was analyzed by the Raspberry Pi App to quantitatively determine the concentration of bacteria in the samples. This biosensor was able to detect Salmonella in spiked chicken samples in 1\u00a0h with lower detection limit of 8\u00a0CFU/50\u00a0\u03bcL and a recovery from 88.96% to 99.74%. This biosensor based on a single tube is very promising to automatically detect foodborne bacteria due to its low cost, high integration and simple operation.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports suggest that glucocorticoids (GCs), which can be synthesized in the oral mucosa, play an important role in cancer development. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to characterize the role of the oral GC system in oral cancer, and determine the effect of black raspberry (BRB) administration on GC modulation during oral cancer chemoprevention. We determined the expression of GC enzymes in various oral cancer cell lines, and investigated the role of the GC inactivating enzyme HSD11B2 on CAL27 oral cancer cells using siRNA mediated knockdown approaches. Using two in vivo models of oral carcinogenesis with 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide carcinogen on C57Bl/6 mice and F344 rats, we determined the effect of BRB on GC modulation during head and neck squamous cell carcinoma chemoprevention. Our results demonstrate that HSD11B2, which inactivates cortisol to cortisone, is downregulated during oral carcinogenesis in clinical and experimental models. Knockdown of HSD11B2 in oral cancer cells promotes cellular proliferation, invasion and expression of angiogenic biomarkers EGFR and VEGFA. An ethanol extract of BRB increased HSD11B2 expression on oral cancer cells. Dietary administration of 5% BRB increased Hsd11b2 gene and protein expression and reduced the active GC, corticosterone, in cancer-induced mouse tongues. Our results demonstrate that the oral GC system is modulated during oral carcinogenesis, and BRB administration upregulates Hsd11b2 during oral cancer chemoprevention. In conclusion, our findings challenge the use of synthetic GCs in head and neck cancer, and support the use of natural product alternatives that potentially modulate GC metabolism in a manner that supports oral cancer chemoprevention.",

    "abstract": "Human gut microbiota is critical for human health, as their dysbiosis could lead to various diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome and obesity. Black raspberry (BRB) has been increasingly studied recently for its impact on gut microbiota as a rich source of phytochemicals (e.g., anthocyanin). To investigate the effect of BRB extract on the gut microbiota composition and their metabolism, an in-vitro human colonic model (HCM) was utilized to study the direct interaction between BRB and gut microbiome. Conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, anaerobic environment) in HCM were closely monitored and maintained to simulate the human intestinal system. Fresh fecal samples donated by three young healthy volunteers were used for gut microbiota inoculation in the HCM. 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing and liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) based metabolomics were performed to study the impact of BRB on gut microbiota characteristics and their metabolism (fatty acids, polar metabolites, and phenolic compounds). Our data suggested that BRB intervention modulated gut microbiota at the genus level in different HCM sections mimicing ascending, transverse, and descending colons. Relative abundance of Enterococcus was commonly decreased in all colon sections, while modulations of other bacteria genera were mostly location-dependent. Meanwhile, significant changes in the metabolic profile of gut microbiota related to fatty acids, endogenous polar metabolites, and phenolic compounds were detected, in which arginine and proline metabolism, lysine degradation, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis were mostly regulated. Moreover, we identified several significant associations between altered microbial populations and changes in microbial metabolites. In summary, our study revealed the impact of BRB intervention on gut microbiota composition and metabolism change, which may exert physiological change to host metabolism and host health.",

    "abstract": "Mechanically robust superhydrophobic coatings have been extensively reported using chemically susceptible inorganic fillers like slica, titanium dioxide, and zinc oxide for constructing micro-nano structures. Organic particles are good candidates for improving chemical resistance, whereas the synthesis of organic particles with well-defined and stable micro-nano structures remains exclusive. Here, an all-organic, cross-linked superhydrophobic coating comprising raspberry-like fluorinated micro particles (RLFMP) and fluorinated polyurethane (FPU) is prepared via thiol-click reaction. Benefiting from the robust micro-nano structure of RLFMP and the excellent flexibility of FPU, the coating can maintain superhydrophobicity after severe alkali corrosion or mechanical damage, while the superhydrophobicity can be repaired readily by the fast recovery of micro-nano roughness and migration of branched fluoroalkyl chains to the coating surface. This design strategy is expected to provide a good application of thiol-click chemistry.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry snack, as a novel berry product, has rich favor and high crisp taste, where controllable texture quality is conducive to the palatability of the snack. Determinative factors of microwave puffing in microwave intensity and duration and key property of material in Young's modulus were introduced to investigate the formation of texture quality of berry snack under microwave puffing. The results indicate that the microwave intensity has negative correlation with Young's modulus of raspberry chips, which causes the more porosity inside under microwave puffing. Reasonable Young's modulus of raspberry chips enhances the interior porosity and exterior expansion volume of raspberry snack due to the water vapor wrapped other than escaped. The greater microwave intensity results in the higher volume expansion of raspberry chips, in which the great volume expansion from porous pores structure confers moderate hardness. In microwave puffing, the formation of hardness and crispness of raspberry snack depend on microwave puffing parameters, leading to high temperature and great dehydration rate in quick puffing duration, in addition to Young's modulus of raspberry chips, where high dehydration rate accelerates water removal inside raspberry chips to form a harder texture with decreasing springiness, whereas low dehydration rate leads to the gentle change of springiness. Raspberry snack with uniform internal pores and regular shape forming desirable texture may be achieved under the microwave intensity of 7.5 W/g and the puffing duration of 6 min. This study indicates that high-quality raspberry snack may be achieved via controlling heating rate in microwave puffing.",

    "abstract": "The retrospective analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals acquired from patients under general anesthesia is crucial in understanding the patient's unconscious brain's state. However, the creation of such database is often tedious and cumbersome and involves human labor. Hence, we developed a Raspberry Pi-based system for archiving EEG signals recorded from patients under anesthesia in operating rooms (ORs) with minimal human involvement.\nUsing this system, we archived patient EEG signals from over 500 unique surgeries at the Emory University Orthopaedics and Spine Hospital, Atlanta, for about 18 months. For this, we developed a software package that runs on a Raspberry Pi and archives patient EEG signals from a SedLine Root EEG Monitor (Masimo) to a secure Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant cloud storage. The OR number corresponding to each surgery was archived along with the EEG signal to facilitate retrospective EEG analysis. We retrospectively processed the archived EEG signals and performed signal quality checks. We also proposed a formula to compute the proportion of true EEG signal and calculated the corresponding statistics. Further, we curated and interleaved patient medical record information with the corresponding EEG signals.\nWe retrospectively processed the EEG signals to demonstrate a statistically significant negative correlation between the relative alpha power (8-12 Hz) of the EEG signal captured under anesthesia and the patient's age.\nOur system is a standalone EEG archiver developed using low cost and readily available hardware. We demonstrated that one could create a large-scale EEG database with minimal human involvement. Moreover, we showed that the captured EEG signal is of good quality for retrospective analysis and combined the EEG signal with the patient medical records. This project's software has been released under an open-source license to enable others to use and contribute.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry anthocyanins were isolated and purified by XAD-7HP macroporous resin and silica gel column chromatography. Anthocyanins were then acylated with methyl salicylate as catalyzed by lipase under reduced pressure, and the conversion rate was 84.26%. LC-MS and NMR were used to identify the structure, and the stability, antioxidant capacity and protective ability of the acylated anthocyanins against oxidative damage were determined. The results showed that cyanindin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) was the primary anthocyanin in raspberry, and the binding site of acylation was on the glucoside C-6, and the product was cyanidin-3-(6-salicyloyl) glucoside (C3-6(S) G). After acylation, its stability in light, heat and oxidation environments could be significantly improved, and acylated ACN showed insignificant changes in antioxidant capacities to scavenge DPPH and ABTS free radicals, as well as oxygen free radical absorptive capacity (ORAC). And it could also effectively prevent the release of ROS caused by oxidative damage and alleviate oxidative stress damage.",
