    "abstract": "In nature, wetting by water droplets on superhydrophobic materials is governed by the Cassie-Baxter or Wenzel models. Moreover, sticky properties, derived from these types of wettings, are required for a wide range of applications involving superhydrophobic materials. As a facile new strategy, a method employing a gaseous fluorine precursor to fabricate core-shell particles, comprising perfectly shaped fluorine shells with adjustable adhesive strength, is described in this paper. Silica was used as the hydrophilic core, while polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was used for the hydrophobic shell coating, forming a raspberry-like shape. In addition, controlling the amount of PVDF coated on the silica surface enabled the water droplets to come into contact with both the PVDF of the shell and the silica of the core, thereby controlling both the superhydrophobicity and the adhesive strength. Thus, the synthesized particles formed a structured coating with controllable stickiness and contact angles of 131-165\u00b0. Furthermore, on surfaces with high adhesivity, the water droplets remained stable at tilt angles of 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 even under a strong centrifugal force, whereas on surfaces with low adhesivity, the water droplets slid off when the substrate was tilted at 4\u00b0.",

This work aims to relate the direct effect of five different mechanical treatments, i.e., variation in the size and number of particles, with the variations in the chemical composition and, subsequently, the effect over the anaerobic digestion of residual raspberry extrudate, which was used as a model substrate. A high variation in the number of particles and the particle size distribution was achieved depending on the mechanical treatment applied, reaching the highest number of particles for the treatments with knife mills and mortar (around 8000 particles per gram). The higher number of particles was related to higher solubilisation, including phenolic compounds and sugars. The combination of knife mills and mortar pretreatment, which presented the highest number of particles, resulted in a 66% more of polyphenols in comparison to the raw substrate. However, the presence of anthocyanins was higher in mechanical treatments with less effect. The enhancement of the anaerobic digestion was clearly related to the increment in the number of particles of small size after the mechanical treatments. The highest methane yield coefficient (236\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0mL CH",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to understand how the addition of pectin (2.5% and 5%) affected the content and bioaccessibility of phenolics in red raspberry puree. The results showed that the concentration of antioxidants in red raspberry puree was reduced with the addition of pectin. Similarly, addition of pectin to red raspberry puree significantly reduced the total phenolic content (15-20%), total antioxidant capacity (18-70%), and total monomeric anthocyanin (25-30%) after in vitro digestion. On the other hand, significant decreases in the bioaccessible amount of cyanidin (41%), cyanidin-3-glucoside (14%), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (17%), pelargonidin 3-glucoside (16%), and peonidin (28%) were observed after the addition of pectin (5% (w/w)) compared to the control (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) as analyzed with the HPLC method. According to the LC-MS/MS analysis of red raspberry samples, five flavonoids (rutin, quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and phlorizin) and six phenolic acids (gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, sinapic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid) were detected. The effect of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion varied depending on the type of the phenolic compounds. Sinapic acid and phlorizin were not detected at all in the intestinal phase, indicating that they were completely degraded during digestion. The percentage bioaccessibility of gallic acid (49-88%), rutin (6-16%), and quercetin (23-33%) was decreased proportionally with the increase in the pectin content in red raspberry purees (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). On the other hand, only 5% pectin addition to red raspberry puree resulted with a significant decrease in the amount of bioaccessible caffeic acid (8% to 5%), kaempferol (24% to 13%), ferulic acid (26% to 10%), and myricetin (91% to 57%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Overall, the present study highlighted that incorporation of pectin to red raspberry puree reduced the amount of bioaccessible polyphenols.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the modulation of gut microbiota by fermented raspberry juice (FRJ) both in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that total phenolic content and antioxidant activities of FRJ reached the highest after fermentation for 42 h. Seventeen phenolic compounds were contained in FRJ, mainly including ellagic acid (496.64 \u00b1 2.91 \u03bcg/g) and anthocyanins (total concentration: 387.93 \u03bcg/g). FRJ modulated the gut microbiota into a healthy in vitro status, with increase of valeric and isovaleric acids production. In healthy mice, all FRJ treatments improved the production of acetic, butyric and isovaleric acids as well as the gene expression of ZO-1, Claudin-1, Claudin-4, Ocdudin, E-cadherin and Muc-2. Moreover, variable gut microbial compositions were found among the groups fed diet-supplemented the different doses of FRJ, within low and median doses of FRJ may regulate the microbiota to a healthier state compared to the high dose supplementation. This study indicated that fermentation is a potential way to produce plant-based juices, which could reshape the gut microbiota and improve the host health.",

In this review, we comprehensively highlighted the synthesis, bioavailability, and metabolism of RK, and summarized the progress made in our understanding of the potential biological activities of RK, including antiobesity, antidiabetes, cardioprotection, and hepatoprotection, as well as their underlying mechanisms. This paper provides a critical overview about the current findings and proposes the future studies in the area of RK on human health. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Raspberry ketone (RK) has been used for weight control for years, but this effect is controversial considering food intake. Additionally, RK is beneficial for T2DM, liver and heart injury. The underlying mechanisms of the protective effect of RK including accelerating fatty acid oxidation, balancing serum glucose level, anti-inflammation, antioxidant process, and so on. In this context, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the benefits of RK against many metabolic diseases and discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms. We hope our work will be helpful for further researches on RK and improve its public recognition.",

    "abstract": "Poor understanding of brain recovery after injury, sparsity of evaluations and limited availability of healthcare services hinders the success of neurorehabilitation programs in rural communities. The availability of neuroimaging ca-pacities in remote communities can alleviate this scenario supporting neurorehabilitation programs in remote settings. This research aims at building a multimodal EEG-fNIRS neuroimaging platform deployable to rural communities to support neurorehabilitation efforts. A Raspberry Pi 4 is chosen as the CPU for the platform responsible for presenting the neurorehabilitation stimuli, acquiring, processing and storing concurrent neuroimaging records as well as the proper synchronization between the neuroimaging streams. We present here two experiments to assess the feasibility and characterization of the Raspberry Pi as the core for a multimodal EEG-fNIRS neuroimaging platform; one over controlled conditions using a combination of synthetic and real data, and another from a full test during resting state. CPU usage, RAM usage and operation temperature were measured during the tests with mean operational records below 40% for CPU cores, 13.6% for memory and 58.85 \u00b0 C for temperatures. Package loss was inexistent on synthetic data and negligible on experimental data. Current consumption can be satisfied with a 1000 mAh 5V battery. The Raspberry Pi 4 was able to cope with the required workload in conditions of operation similar to those needed to support a neurorehabilitation evaluation.",

    "abstract": "A lab-on-a-tube biosensor was established to rapidly, sensitively and automatically detect foodborne bacteria through a rotatable Halbach magnet to form and rotate magnetic nanobead (MNB) chains for specific isolation of target bacteria, gold@platinum nanocatalysts (Au@PtNCs) to label target bacteria for efficient amplification of detection signal and Raspberry Pi App to collect and analyze the image of catalysate. First, the glass tube was successively preloaded with the mixture of MNBs, sample and Au@PtNCs, the washing buffer (skim milk) and the substrate (hydrogen peroxide-3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine), and they were separated by air gaps. After the tube was placed on the biosensor, the MNB chains were stably formed and continuously rotated using the Halbach magnet and the mixture was moved back and forth using a programmable peristaltic pump, thus making the formation of MNB-bacteria-Au@PtNCs complexes. After the washing buffer was moved to wash the complexes, the substrate was then moved to resuspend the complexes, resulting in the catalytic reaction that changed the color of the substrate. Finally, the catalysate was moved to the designated area, the image of which was analyzed by the Raspberry Pi App to quantitatively determine the concentration of bacteria in the samples. This biosensor was able to detect Salmonella in spiked chicken samples in 1\u00a0h with lower detection limit of 8\u00a0CFU/50\u00a0\u03bcL and a recovery from 88.96% to 99.74%. This biosensor based on a single tube is very promising to automatically detect foodborne bacteria due to its low cost, high integration and simple operation.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone [4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone] is a natural aromatic compound found in raspberries and other fruits. Raspberry ketone (RK) is synthetically produced for use as a commercial flavoring agent. In the United States and other markets, it is sold as a dietary supplement for weight control. The potential of RK to reduce or prevent excessive weight gain is unclear and could be a convergence of several different actions. This study sought to determine whether acute RK can immediately delay carbohydrate hyperglycemia and reduce gastrointestinal emptying. In addition, we explored the metabolic signature of chronic RK to prevent or remedy the metabolic effects of diet-induced weight gain. In high-fat diet (HFD; 45% fat)-fed male mice, acute oral gavage of RK (200 mg/kg) reduced hyperglycemia from oral sucrose load (4 g/kg) at 15 min. In HFD-fed female mice, acute oral RK resulted in an increase in blood glucose at 30 min. Chronic daily oral gavage of RK (200 mg/kg) commencing with HFD access (HFD_RK) for 11 weeks resulted in less body weight gain and reduced fat mass compared with vehicle treated (HFD_Veh) and chronic RK starting 4 weeks after HFD access (HFD_RKw4) groups. Compared with a control group fed a low-fat diet (LFD; 10% fat) and dosed with vehicle (LFD_Veh), glucose AUC of an oral glucose tolerance test was increased with HFD_Veh, but not in HFD_RK or HFD_RKw4.

    "abstract": "Human gut microbiota is critical for human health, as their dysbiosis could lead to various diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome and obesity. Black raspberry (BRB) has been increasingly studied recently for its impact on gut microbiota as a rich source of phytochemicals (e.g., anthocyanin). To investigate the effect of BRB extract on the gut microbiota composition and their metabolism, an in-vitro human colonic model (HCM) was utilized to study the direct interaction between BRB and gut microbiome. Conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, anaerobic environment) in HCM were closely monitored and maintained to simulate the human intestinal system. Fresh fecal samples donated by three young healthy volunteers were used for gut microbiota inoculation in the HCM. 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing and liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) based metabolomics were performed to study the impact of BRB on gut microbiota characteristics and their metabolism (fatty acids, polar metabolites, and phenolic compounds). Our data suggested that BRB intervention modulated gut microbiota at the genus level in different HCM sections mimicing ascending, transverse, and descending colons. Relative abundance of Enterococcus was commonly decreased in all colon sections, while modulations of other bacteria genera were mostly location-dependent. Meanwhile, significant changes in the metabolic profile of gut microbiota related to fatty acids, endogenous polar metabolites, and phenolic compounds were detected, in which arginine and proline metabolism, lysine degradation, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis were mostly regulated. Moreover, we identified several significant associations between altered microbial populations and changes in microbial metabolites. In summary, our study revealed the impact of BRB intervention on gut microbiota composition and metabolism change, which may exert physiological change to host metabolism and host health.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered one of the most serious public health problems affecting liver. The reported beneficial impact of raspberries on obesity and associated metabolic disorder makes it a suitable candidate against NAFLD. In the current study, the chemical profile of raspberry seed oil (RO) was characterized by analysis of fatty acid and tocopherol contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in addition to the determination of total phenolic and flavonoids. High levels of unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid (49.9%), \u03b1-linolenic acid (25.98%), and oleic acid (17.6%), along with high total tocopherol content (184\u00a0mg/100\u00a0gm) were detected in oil. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents in RO were estimated to be 22.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25\u00a0mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100\u00a0mg oil and 1.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15\u00a0mg\u00a0quercetin (QU)/100\u00a0mg, respectively. Anti-NAFLD efficacy of RO at different doses (0.4 and 0.8\u00a0mL) in a model of a high-fat diet (HFD) fed rats was assessed by estimating lipid profile, liver enzyme activity, glucose and insulin levels as well as adipokines and inflammatory marker. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), which is a molecular target for NAFLD was also tested. Liver histopathology was carried out and its homogenate was used to estimate oxidative stress markers. Consumption of RO significantly improved lipid parameters and hepatic enzyme activities, reduced insulin resistance and glucose levels, significantly ameliorated inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. Furthermore, RO treatment significantly modulated adipokines activities and elevated PPAR\u03b3 levels. Raspberry seed oil administration significantly improved these HFD induced histopathological alterations. Moreover, a molecular docking study was performed on the identified fatty acids and tocopherols. Among the identified compounds, oleic acid, \u03b1-linolenic acid and \u03b3-tocopherol exhibited the highest docking score as PPAR\u03b3 activator posing them as a potential anti-NAFLD drug leads. Study findings suggest RO as an effective therapeutic candidate for ameliorating NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry snack, as a novel berry product, has rich favor and high crisp taste, where controllable texture quality is conducive to the palatability of the snack. Determinative factors of microwave puffing in microwave intensity and duration and key property of material in Young's modulus were introduced to investigate the formation of texture quality of berry snack under microwave puffing. The results indicate that the microwave intensity has negative correlation with Young's modulus of raspberry chips, which causes the more porosity inside under microwave puffing. Reasonable Young's modulus of raspberry chips enhances the interior porosity and exterior expansion volume of raspberry snack due to the water vapor wrapped other than escaped. The greater microwave intensity results in the higher volume expansion of raspberry chips, in which the great volume expansion from porous pores structure confers moderate hardness. In microwave puffing, the formation of hardness and crispness of raspberry snack depend on microwave puffing parameters, leading to high temperature and great dehydration rate in quick puffing duration, in addition to Young's modulus of raspberry chips, where high dehydration rate accelerates water removal inside raspberry chips to form a harder texture with decreasing springiness, whereas low dehydration rate leads to the gentle change of springiness. Raspberry snack with uniform internal pores and regular shape forming desirable texture may be achieved under the microwave intensity of 7.5 W/g and the puffing duration of 6 min. This study indicates that high-quality raspberry snack may be achieved via controlling heating rate in microwave puffing.",

    "abstract": "One of the major risk factors for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is tobacco smoke exposure, but the mechanisms that can account for disease development remain to be fully defined. Utilizing our HNSCC mouse model, we analyzed oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) induced by the active metabolite of a common smoke constituent, dibenzo[a,l]pyrene diol-epoxide (DBPDE). Analyzing protein expression by either immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry, we identified biologic processes that are dysregulated in premalignant and invasive cancer lesions induced by DBPDE. Interestingly, p120ctn expression is downregulated in both stages of the disease. In addition to decreased p120ctn expression, there was also increased proliferation (as measured by Ki67), inflammation (as measured by NFkB (p65) expression), neovascularization (as measured by CD31) and recruitment of Ly6G-positive immune cells as well as strong EGFR expression. We also examined the effect of the chemopreventive agent black raspberry (BRB) on p120ctn and EGFR protein expression in DBPDE treated mice. p120ctn, but not EGFR, protein expression increased in mice treated with BRB. Our results suggest that modulation of p120ctn may, in part, account for the mechanism by which BRB inhibits DBPDE induced OSCC in mice.",

    "abstract": "Bespoke (custom-built) Raspberry Pi cameras are increasingly popular research tools in the fields of behavioral ecology and conservation, because of their comparative flexibility in programmable settings, ability to be paired with other sensors, and because they are typically cheaper than commercially built models.Here, we describe a novel, Raspberry Pi-based camera system that is fully portable and yet weatherproof-especially to humidity and salt spray. The camera was paired with a passive infrared sensor, to create a movement-triggered camera capable of recording videos over a 24-hr period. We describe an example deployment involving \"retro-fitting\" these cameras into artificial nest boxes on Praia Islet, Azores archipelago, Portugal, to monitor the behaviors and interspecific interactions of two sympatric species of storm-petrel (Monteiro's storm-petrel ",

    "abstract": "An understanding of cellular mechanoresponses to well-defined synthetic topographic features is crucial for the fundamental research and biomedical applications of stem cells. Structured biointerfaces, in particular the ones with nanometer and/or micrometer surficial features, have drawn more attention in the past few decades. However, it is still difficult to integrate nanostructures and microstructures onto the synthesized biointerfaces to mimic the hierarchical architecture of the native extracellular matrix (ECM). Herein, a series of \"raspberry\"-like hierarchical surfaces with well-defined nanofeatures and tunable nano/microfeatures have been achieved via a catecholic polymer coating technique. Cellular responses to these hierarchical interfaces were systemically studied, indicating that the nanofeatures on the raspberry surfaces significantly enhanced the mechanosensing of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to interfacial physical cues. Cell mechanotransduction was further investigated by analyzing focal adhesion assembling, cytoskeleton organization, cell nuclear mechanics, and transcriptional activity. The results suggest that nanosize surficial features could increase cellular mechanosensing to environment physical cues. The mechanotransduction and cell fate specification were greatly enhanced by the ECM mimicking nano/microhierarchical biointerfaces but the features should be in an optimized size.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry is a source of dietary fibre and phenolic compounds, which are metabolised by the gut microbiota, resulting in the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and phenolic catabolites; but the formation of these compounds depends on the microbiota composition. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the raspberry and its fractions (phenolic extract, total and insoluble dietary fibre) affect the microbial activity depending on the body weight condition. For this, in vitro fermentations of raspberry fractions were carried out using faeces from normal-weight (NW) and overweight volunteers (OW) during 48\u00a0h, and phenolic catabolites and SCFAs were analysed at 0, 6, 24 and 48\u00a0h. The whole raspberry and the phenolic extract produced greater quantities of urolithins and total SCFAs when compared with fibre fractions, reaching the highest amount between 24 and 48\u00a0h. The body weight condition was an important factor, since faeces from NW led to greater production of urolithins from non-extractable phenolic compounds bound to fibre fractions, whereas in OW the urolithins production was higher from the fractions with more extractable polyphenols. In summary, the whole raspberry has been shown to have a prebiotic effect, mainly due to its phenolic compounds content rather than its fibre content.",

    "abstract": "This work focuses on developing light environments for the effective regulation of morphogenesis and ex vitro conditions adaptation in micropropagated raspberry plants on the basis of photomorphogenetic control of physiological processes using light-emitting diodes (LEDs). In experiments with cloned plants growing ex vitro in stressful conditions during acclimation, the effects of optical radiation of various spectral combinations from different photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) spectral regions were studied. The data on the plant development and state of the photosynthetic apparatus, features of photosynthetic gas exchange and transpiration, accumulation of photosynthetic pigments, light curves of photosynthesis, and data on growth processes in light modes using combined quasimonochromatic radiation (either mixture of red, green, and blue light or red, far-red, and blue light) with various ratio of the distinct spectral regions were obtained. Photosynthetic apparatus functional activity under different light conditions was studied with chlorophyll fluorescence determination, and plant stress responses to growing under artificial spectral light conditions were characterized. The experiments were accompanied by detailed plant phenotyping at the structural and functional levels. Plant acclimation and photosynthetic improvements in response to added far-red and green light wavelengths to the main red-blue spectrum have been elucidated.",

    "abstract": "Correlated localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR), surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and localized electromagnetic (EM) field distributions of pure and modified gold (Au) nanoassemblies have been demonstrated. The Au nanoassemblies were decorated as half-raspberry-like nanostructures by silver (Ag) mists, and the characteristics of their SPR and SERS were observed at the same spatial position with and without decoration. The decoration of Au nanoassemblies was analyzed in-depth and confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Multifunctional and lab-built microscopy was used to capture correlated SPR and SERS imaging and spectral measurements. Without decoration, strong SPR peaks and enhanced SERS signals were observed, whereas intense plasmon excitation deteriorated with a broadening and diminishing peak and the SERS enhancement dropped at least by 10 fold upon the modification. Preferential enhancement near the edge was observed in the correlated SPR and SERS measurements. The variations in localized SPR, subsequent SERS enhancement, and preferential confinement were speculated concerning localized EM near-field deformation. A typical tetramer with five interstitials was modeled and simulated by finite difference time domain (FDTD) analysis at different incident polarizations. The EM near-field distributions were extracted with and without decoration of constituent interstitials by Ag mists. Without the modification of participating interstitials, the EM near-field distributions were found confined, whereas additional EM near-field confinements were observed in the presence of Ag mists. Such EM near-field deformations due to the modification of constituent interstitials were supposed to broaden and deteriorate SPR characteristics of Au nanoassemblies as observed under this investigation.",

    "abstract": "Edge Computing enables to perform measurement and cognitive decisions outside a central server by performing data storage, manipulation, and processing on the Internet of Things (IoT) node. Also, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning applications have become a rudimentary procedure in virtually every industrial or preliminary system. Consequently, the Raspberry Pi is adopted, which is a low-cost computing platform that is profitably applied in the field of IoT. As for the software part, among the plethora of Machine Learning (ML) paradigms reported in the literature, we identified Rulex, as a good ML platform, suitable to be implemented on the Raspberry Pi. In this paper, we present the porting of the Rulex ML platform on the board to perform ML forecasts in an IoT setup. Specifically, we explain the porting Rulex's libraries on Windows 32 Bits, Ubuntu 64 Bits, and Raspbian 32 Bits. Therefore, with the aim of carrying out an in-depth verification of the application possibilities, we propose to perform forecasts on five unrelated datasets from five different applications, having varying sizes in terms of the number of records, skewness, and dimensionality. These include a small Urban Classification dataset, three larger datasets concerning Human Activity detection, a Biomedical dataset related to mental state, and a Vehicle Activity Recognition dataset. The overall accuracies for the forecasts performed are: 84.13%, 99.29% (for SVM), 95.47% (for SVM), and 95.27% (For KNN) respectively. Finally, an image-based gender classification dataset is employed to perform image classification on the Edge. Moreover, a novel image pre-processing Algorithm was developed that converts images into Time-series by relying on statistical contour-based detection techniques. Even though the dataset contains inconsistent and random images, in terms of subjects and settings, Rulex achieves an overall accuracy of 96.47% while competing with the literature which is dominated by forward-facing and mugshot images. Additionally, power consumption for the Raspberry Pi in a Client/Server setup was compared with an HP laptop, where the board takes more time, but consumes less energy for the same ML task.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic fibrosis is a wound-healing process caused by prolonged liver damage and often occurs due to hepatic stellate cell activation in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Red raspberry has been found to attenuate oxidative stress, mainly because it is rich in bioactive components. In the current study, we investigated the inhibitory effects and associated molecular mechanisms of red raspberry extract (RBE) upon activated hepatic stellate cell (aHSC) in cellular and rat models. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were increased in the dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-applied samples, whereas treatment of RBE significantly suppressed the activities of these enzymes. In addition, a histopathological analysis demonstrated that RBE could substantially diminish the hepatic collagen content and alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression induced by DMN. Administration of 250\u00a0\u03bcg/mL RBE could also arrest the growth and enhance the apoptosis of activated HSC-T6 cells, which was accompanied with elevated levels of activated caspases and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Particularly, RBE application remarkably abolished oxidative damage within the cells and reduced the carbonylation of proteins, which was attributed to the upregulation of catalase, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Moreover, the knockdown of Nrf2 together with the RBE treatment synergistically abrogated the expression of \u03b1-SMA and promoted the level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3), suggesting that RBE could mitigate the transdifferentiation of HSC in a Nrf2-independent manner. These findings implied that the application of RBE could effectively remove oxidative stress and relieve the activation of HSC via modulating the caspase/PARP, Nrf2/HO-1 and PPAR-\u03b3 pathways, which may allow the development of novel therapeutic strategies against chemical-caused liver fibrogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry anthocyanins were isolated and purified by XAD-7HP macroporous resin and silica gel column chromatography. Anthocyanins were then acylated with methyl salicylate as catalyzed by lipase under reduced pressure, and the conversion rate was 84.26%. LC-MS and NMR were used to identify the structure, and the stability, antioxidant capacity and protective ability of the acylated anthocyanins against oxidative damage were determined. The results showed that cyanindin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) was the primary anthocyanin in raspberry, and the binding site of acylation was on the glucoside C-6, and the product was cyanidin-3-(6-salicyloyl) glucoside (C3-6(S) G). After acylation, its stability in light, heat and oxidation environments could be significantly improved, and acylated ACN showed insignificant changes in antioxidant capacities to scavenge DPPH and ABTS free radicals, as well as oxygen free radical absorptive capacity (ORAC). And it could also effectively prevent the release of ROS caused by oxidative damage and alleviate oxidative stress damage.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK) is a major flavor compound in red raspberries, and it has been marketed as a popular weight-loss dietary supplement with high potential in accumulating in fatty tissues. However, challenges in extracting and characterizing RK and its associated phenolic compounds in fatty tissues persist due to the complex matrix effect. In this work, we reported a high-throughput sample preparation method for RK and 25 related phenolic compounds in white adipose tissues using an improved micro-scale QuEChERS (quick, efficient, cheap, easy, rugged and safe) approach with enhanced matrix removal (EMR)-lipid cleanup in 96-well plates, followed by UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS analysis. The absolute recovery was 73-105% at the extraction step, and achieved 71-96% at the EMR cleanup step. The EMR cleanup removed around 66% of total lipids in the acetonitrile extract as profiled by UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. The innovative introduction of a reversed-phase C18 sorbent into the extract significantly improved the analytes' recovery during SpeedVac drying. The final accuracy achieved 80-120% for most analytes. Overall, this newly developed and validated method could serve as a powerful tool for analyzing RK and related phenolic compounds in fatty tissues.",

    "abstract": "A continuous high-fat/high-fructose diet induces inflammation and lowers vascular endothelial function in the body. This research examined the effects of black raspberry (BR) powder consumption on the inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction in rats fed with a high-fat diet and fructose solution. Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups as control (AIN-93G diet + distilled water) and HFF (high-fat diet + 20% fructose solution) groups, for 16\u00a0weeks. At 8\u00a0weeks, the HFF was further divided into three subgroups: HFF, HFFBR2.5 (2.5% BR in high-fat diet), and HFFBR5 (5% BR in high-fat diet). The BR-fed groups showed significantly higher high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and lower triglycerides than the HFF group. Rats supplemented with BR showed decreased mRNA and protein expressions of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules in the liver and aorta tissues. Furthermore, the aortic protein expression of endothelial nitroxide synthase was significantly greater in the HFFBR2.5 and HFFBR5 than HFF. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Black raspberry (BR: Rubus occidentalis) is abundant in flavonoids and anthocyanins. BR displays various biological activities and has been used to alleviate inflammatory conditions. In our study, BR supplementation showed promising effects against high-fat/high-fructose diet-induced inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in rats by decreasing markers of inflammation and improving vascular endothelial function. These findings suggest that BR consumption could have beneficial effects on the risk factors of cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "In the paper, an attempt was made to use methods of artificial neural networks (ANN) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to identify raspberry powders that are different from each other in terms of the amount and the type of polysaccharide. Spectra in the absorbance function (FTIR) were prepared as well as training sets, taking into account the structure of microparticles acquired from microscopic images with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In addition to the above, Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks (MLPNs) with a set of texture descriptors (machine learning) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with bitmap (deep learning) were devised, which is an innovative attitude to solving this issue. The aim of the paper was to create MLPN and CNN neural models, which are characterized by a high efficiency of classification. It translates into recognizing microparticles (obtaining their homogeneity) of raspberry powders on the basis of the texture of the image pixel.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic condition characterized by glucose clearance abnormalities and insufficient insulin response. Left uncontrolled, T2DM can result in serious complications and death. With no cure available currently and the prevalence of major risk factors such as pre-diabetes and the metabolic syndrome continuously increasing, there is an urgent need for effective treatments with limited or no side effects. Red raspberries (RR) contain various phytonutrients with potential for modulating insulin function, glucose, and lipid metabolism. The objective of this literature review was to investigate the potential metabolic benefits of dietary RR in individuals with T2DM and pre-diabetes. A search of major scientific databases was employed to identify peer-reviewed, in vivo, or human studies that utilized whole RR or its functional constituents as treatment. The studies examined provide evidence that RR may offer clinically beneficial effects for the prevention and management of chronic diseases through improvements in glucose handling and insulin sensitivity, adiposity, lipid profiles, ectopic lipid accumulation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cardiac health. More human trials and in vivo studies are needed to confirm the benefits of dietary RR in T2DM and pre-diabetes and to explore the dose-dependent relationships, optimal duration, and treatment modality.",

    "abstract": "Rubus chingii, is widely distributed in many Asian countries and well known for its medicinal and dietary properties. Diversity of fruit color in raspberry has been attributed to the presence of either anthocyanins or carotenoids. In this study, we investigated anthocyanins and carotenoids, and their biosynthesis by LC-MS/MS. Six anthocyanins mainly consisted of flavanol-anthocyanins while five carotenoids mainly consisted of \u03b2-citraurin esters. Flavanol-anthocyanins were produced from an offshoot of the anthocyanin biosynthesis, which started with biosynthesis of flavanols and anthocyanidin by leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR)/anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS/LDOX) respectively. \u03b2-citraurin esters were produced from cleavage of zeaxanthin and esterification by organic acid, which was an offshoot of the carotenoid biosynthesis. The offshoot started with biosynthesis of zeaxanthin and \u03b2-citraurin by carotene \u03b2-hydroxylase (CHYB/LUT5) and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) respectively. During fruit ripening, biosynthesis of flavanols and anthocyanins was down-regulated by genes/proteins involved in phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, while biosynthesis of \u03b2-citraurin esters was up-regulated by imbalanced expression of genes/proteins involved in \u03b2,\u03b2-ring and \u03b2, \u03b5-ring hydroxylation. Thus, \u03b2-citraurin esters, instead of anthocyanins imparted reddish color to the ripe fruit. These pigments and their biosynthesis in R. chingii are totally different from what occurs in other raspberry species.",

    "abstract": "Sterile male Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt), fed as immature adults on the plant compound raspberry ketone (RK), show a reduced attraction to cuelure, a synthetic analogue of RK used as an attractant in Male Annihilation Technique. We hypothesized the reduced attraction of RK-fed adult males to cuelure may be a consequence of altered expression of chemoreception genes. A Y-tube olfactometer assay with RK-fed and RK-unfed sterile B. tryoni males tested the subsequent behavioural response to cuelure. Behavioral assays confirmed a significant decrease in attraction of RK-fed sterile males to cuelure. RK-fed, non-responders (to cue-lure) and RK-unfed, responders (to cue-lure) males were sampled and gene expression compared by de novo RNA-seq analysis. A total of 269 genes in fly heads were differentially expressed between replicated groups of RK-fed, cuelure non-responders and RK-unfed, cuelure responders. Among them, 218 genes including 4 chemoreceptor genes were up regulated and 51 genes were down regulated in RK-fed, cuelure non-responders. De novo assembly generated many genes with unknown functions and no significant BLAST hits to homologues in other species. The enriched and suppressed genes reported here, shed light on the transcriptional changes that affect the dynamics of insect responses to chemical stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Promoting the consumption of fruits is a key objective of nutrition policy campaigns due to their associated health benefits. Raspberries are well appreciated for their remarkable flavor and nutritional value attributable to their antioxidant properties. Consequently, one of the objectives of present-day raspberry breeding programs is to improve the fruit's sensory and nutritive characteristics. However, developing new genotypes with enhanced quality traits is a complex task due to the intricate impacts genetic and environmental factors have on these attributes, and the difficulty to phenotype them. We used a multi-platform metabolomic approach to compare flavor- and nutritional-related metabolite profiles of four raspberry cultivars ('Glen Ample', 'Sch\u00f6nemann', 'Tulameen' and 'Veten') grown in different European climates. Although the cultivars appear to be better adapted to high latitudes, for their content in soluble solids and acidity, multivariate statistical analyses allowed us to underscore important genotypic differences based on the profiles of important metabolites. 'Sch\u00f6nemann' and 'Veten' were characterized by high levels of anthocyanins and ellagitannins, respectively, 'Tulameen' by its acidity, and 'Glen Ample' for its content of sucrose and \u03b2-ionone, two main flavor contributors. Our results confirmed the value of metabolomic-driven approaches, which may foster the development of cultivars with enhanced health properties and flavor.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone is one of the characteristic flavors of raspberry fruits, and it is an important and expensive ingredient in the flavor and fragrance industries. It is present at low levels in plant tissues, and its occurrence is limited to a few taxa. In this context, the stable production of nature-identical raspberry ketone using heterologous synthesis in plants hosts has recently garnered the attention of plant biochemists. In this study, we demonstrate the rational switching of the metabolic flow from anthocyanin pigments to volatile phenylbutanoid production via the phenylpropanoid pathway. This shift led to the efficient and stable production of raspberry ketone and its glycosides via heterologous expression of the biosynthetic enzymes benzalacetone synthase (BAS) and raspberry ketone/zingerone synthase 1 (RZS1) in the transgenic tobacco (",

    "abstract": "Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) provides an excellent opportunity to investigate better automatic medical decision support tools with the effective integration of various medical equipment and associated data. This study explores two such medical decision-making tasks, namely COVID-19 detection and lung area segmentation detection, using chest radiography images. We also explore different cutting-edge machine learning techniques, such as federated learning, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning to explore the issue. To analyze the applicability of computationally less capable edge devices in the IoMT system, we report the results using Raspberry Pi devices as accuracy, precision, recall, Fscore for COVID-19 detection, and average dice score for lung segmentation detection tasks. We also publish the results obtained through server-centric simulation for comparison. The results show that Raspberry Pi-centric devices provide better performance in lung segmentation detection, and server-centric experiments provide better results in COVID-19 detection. We also discuss the IoMT application-centric settings, utilizing medical data and decision support systems, and posit that such a system could benefit all the stakeholders in the IoMT domain.",

    "abstract": "Combined transcriptomic and metabolic analyses reveal that fruit of Rubus chingii Hu launches biosynthesis of phenolic acids and flavonols at beginning of fruit set and then coordinately accumulated or converted to their derivatives. Rubus chingii Hu (Chinese raspberry) is an important dual functional food with nutraceutical and pharmaceutical values. Comprehensively understanding the mechanisms of fruit development and bioactive components synthesis and regulation could accelerate genetic analysis and molecular breeding for the unique species. Combined transcriptomic and metabolic analyses of R. chingii fruits from different developmental stages, including big green, green-to-yellow, yellow-to-orange, and red stages, were conducted. A total of 89,188 unigenes were generated and 57,545 unigenes (64.52%) were annotated. Differential expression genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were mainly involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The fruit launched the biosynthesis of phenolic acids and flavonols at the very beginning of fruit set and then coordinately accumulated or converted to their derivatives. This was tightly regulated by expressions of the related genes and MYB and bHLH transcription factors. The core genes products participated in the biosynthesis of ellagic acid (EA) and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (K-3-R), such as DAHPS, DQD/SDH, PAL, 4CL, CHS, CHI, F3H, F3'H, FLS, and UGT78D2, and their corresponding metabolites were elaborately characterized. Our research reveals the molecular and chemical mechanisms of the fruit development of R. chingii. The results provide a solid foundation for the genetic analysis, functional genes isolation, fruit quality improvement and modifiable breeding of R. chingii.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketones have important therapeutic properties such as anti-influenza and prevention of diabetes. In order to obtain raspberry ketone from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, two enzymes catalyzing the last two steps of raspberry ketone synthesis, i.e. 4-coumaryl-CoA ligase (4CL) and polyketide synthase (PKS1), were fused using a glycine-serine-glycine (GSG) tripeptide linker to construct an expression vector pChla-4CL-PKS1. The fusion gene 4CL-PKS1 driven by a PSAD promoter was transformed into a wild-type (CC125) and a cell wall-deficient C. reinhardtii (CC425) by electroporation. The results showed the recombinant C. reinhardtii strain CC125 and CC425 with 4CL-PKS1 produced raspberry ketone at a level of 6.7 \u03bcg/g (fresh weight) and 5.9 \u03bcg/g (fresh weight), respectively, both were higher than that of the native raspberry ketone producing plants (2-4 \u03bcg/g).",

    "abstract": "The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a sustainable pest management tool based on the release of millions of sterile insects that suppress reproduction in targeted populations. Success of SIT depends on survival, maturation, dispersal, and mating of released sterile insects. Laboratory and field cage studies have demonstrated that dietary supplements of methoprene and raspberry ketone (RK) promote sexual maturation of adult Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt), and may hence shorten the delay between release and maturity in the field. We investigated the effects of methoprene and RK dietary supplements on field abundance of sexually mature sterile Q-flies relative to untreated flies fed only sugar and yeast hydrolysate before release at 2 d of age. Compared with untreated flies, more methoprene- and RK-treated flies were recaptured in cuelure traps to which only sexually mature males are attracted. At distances of 100 and 200 m from the release point, recapture rates were higher for methoprene- and RK-treated flies than for untreated flies, but at 300 m recapture rates were low and were similar for treated and untreated flies. Rainfall, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction did not affect recapture rates, but temperature was positively correlated with recapture rates for all treatments. There was a strong correlation between the number of sterile and wild flies caught in traps, indicating co-location in the field. Dietary supplements of methoprene and RK can substantially increase abundance of sexually mature sterile male Q-flies in the field following release as 2-d-old immature adults.",

    "abstract": "In auditory behavioral and EEG experiments, the variability of stimulation solutions, for both software and hardware, adds unnecessary technical constraints. Currently, there is no easy to use, inexpensive, and shareable solution that could improve collaborations and data comparisons across different sites and contexts. This article outlines a system composed by a Raspberry Pi coupled with Python programming and associated with a HifiBerry sound card. We compare its sound performances with those of a wide variety of materials and configurations. This solution achieves the high timing accuracy and sound quality important in auditory cognition experiments, while being simple to use and open source. The present system shows high performances and results along with excellent feedback from users. It is inexpensive, easy to build, share, and improve on. Working with such low-cost, powerful, and collaborative hardware and software tools allows people to create their own specific, adapted, and shareable system that can be standardized across different collaborative sites, while being extremely simple and robust in use.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Previously, we reported that blueberry extract constrains the growth of CC. Raspberry is a widely consumed fruit that exhibits antitumor properties against several cancer types but little is known about its direct effect on CC. This study was designed to investigate the potential antitumor effect of raspberry extract (RE) on CC cells and to elucidate the possible mechanisms behind it.\nClonogenic survival assay and caspase-3 activity kits were used to evaluate the effects of RE on cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis of a widely used CC cell line, HeLa. Possible molecular mechanisms were investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.\nThe percentage of colonies and optic density value of HeLa cells decreased in the presence of RE in comparison to controls. Relative caspase-3 activity in cancer cells increased in the presence of RE in comparison to controls. The antitumor effect displayed on HeLa cells by RE was associated with the increased expression of antiproliferative molecule P53 and the increased expression of pro-apoptotic molecule tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6 (FAS).\nRE displays anticancer activity against CC HeLa cells. The mechanism behind this is by up-regulation of anti-proliferative molecule P53 and pro-apoptotic molecule FAS.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK) is an aromatic phenolic compound naturally occurring in red raspberries, kiwifruit, peaches, and apples and reported for its potential therapeutic and nutraceutical properties. Studies in cells and rodents have suggested an important role for RK in hepatic/cardio/gastric protection and as an anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-obesity, depigmentation, and sexual maturation agent. Raspberry ketone-mediated activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR-\u03b1) stands out as one of its main modes of action. Although rodent studies have demonstrated the efficacious effects of RK, its mechanism remains largely unknown. In spite of a lack of reliable human research, RK is marketed as a health supplement, at very high doses. In this review, we provide a compilation of scientific research that has been conducted so far, assessing the therapeutic properties of RK in several disease conditions as well as inspiring future research before RK can be considered safe and efficacious with limited side effects as an alternative to modern medicines in the treatment of major lifestyle-based diseases.",

    "abstract": "Control of the shape and uniformity of colloid particles is essential for realizing their functionality in various applications. Herein, we report a facile approach for the synthesis of narrowly dispersed anisotropic microparticles with well-defined raspberry-like and golf ball-like surface patterns. First, we demonstrate that hybrid raspberry-like particles can be achieved through a one-pot polymerization method using glycidyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (GPOSS) and pentaerythritol tetra(3-mercaptopropionate) (PETMP) as monomers. Varying the polymerization parameters such as catalyst loading, monomer concentration, and the molar ratio of monomers, we are able to regulate the sizes and surface protrusion numbers of these raspberry-like microparticles. The formation mechanism is attributed to a competition balance between thiol-epoxy reaction and thiol-thiol coupling reaction. The former promotes rapid formation of large core particles between PETMP and GPOSS droplets (which can serve as core particles), while the latter allows for generation of surface protrusions by PETMP self-polymerization, leading to the formation of raspberry-like surface patterns. Based on the different POSS contents in the surface protrusions and cores of the raspberry-like microparticles, we demonstrate that they can be used as precursors to produce microporous silica (sub)microparticles with golf ball-like morphology ",

Herein, a new type of raspberry-like cytochrome C-imprinted nanoparticle was first designed and fabricated via surface imprinting technology combined with a template immobilization strategy. In particular, the state-of-the-art metal-organic framework (MOF)/carbon nanoparticle (CN) composites were selected as protein immobilization carriers for two advantages: (1) the composites reflected the intrinsic characteristics of MOFs including flexible design, facile preparation, and extensive interactions with proteins and (2) the utilization of composites also overcame the issue associated with the severe agglomeration of individual MOFs during the post-use process. Therefore, the as-prepared composites exhibited a regular raspberry-like shape with good dispersion (polydispersity index (PDI) < 0.25), high specific surface area (551.4 m",

The use of E. coli DH10\u03b2 facilitates the Golden Gate cloning process for the screening of combinatorial libraries. In addition, we also newly establish a novel colour-based phenotypic screen to identify productive clones quickly from solid/liquid culture.",

    "abstract": "Although Dietary supplements are readily accessible and extensively used worldwide, they are inadequately regulated and consumers are victims of manufacturers' fraud. Thus, quality regulations are required to ensure safety of products available to the public. We propose the first native spectrofluorimetric quality control assay of raspberry ketone, a popular dietary supplement ingredient for weight loss. This work relies on the constant wavelength synchronous scan of the Raspberry Ketone native fluorescence, overcoming the demerits of conventional excitation/ emission spectra. For the best measurement conditions, several parameters were optimized including \u0394\u03bb value, diluting solvent, medium pH and the effect of surfactants/ macromolecules. In aqueous medium (\u0394\u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0110\u00a0nm), a linear relationship exists between synchronous fluorescence intensity at peak maximum 405.6\u00a0nm and solution concentration in the range 300-1500\u00a0ng/mL. Method sensitivity was recorded with LOD and LOQ values 60.63 and 183.72\u00a0ng/mL; respectively. Validation was done in accordance to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. This simple procedure was successfully applied to the analysis of Raspberry Ketone in commercially available dietary supplement capsules with average recovery 98.67% \u00b1 1.74 and further extended to weight variation testing following the official United States Pharmacopeial (USP) guidelines. Finally, green assessment was done using the ''Analytical Eco-scale'' tool. The total score was 89/100 points revealing excellent greenness of our proposal. Our proposal is simple, eco-friendly and cheap. It can be conveniently adopted for routine quality control practices especially in developing countries.",

    "abstract": "Single-board computers (SBCs) and microcontroller boards (MCBs) are extensively used nowadays as prototyping platforms to accomplish innovative tasks. Very recently, implementations of these devices for diagnostics applications are rapidly gaining ground for research and educational purposes. Among the available solutions, Raspberry Pi represents one of the most used SBCs. In the present work, two setups based on Raspberry Pi and its CMOS-based camera (a 3D-printed device and an adaptation of a commercial product named We-Lab) were investigated as diagnostic instruments. Different camera elaboration processes were investigated, showing how direct access to the 10-bit raw data acquired from the sensor before downstream imaging processes could be beneficial for photometric applications. The developed solution was successfully applied to the evaluation of the oxidative stress using two commercial kits (d-ROM Fast; PAT). We suggest the analysis of raw data applied to SBC and MCB platforms in order to improve results.",

    "abstract": "Sporadic foveolar-type gastric adenoma (FGA) has been described as an extremely rare polyp that is whitish and flatly elevated. However, we recently found that sporadic FGA with a raspberry-like appearance (FGA-RA) is not rare in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-na\u00efve gastric mucosa. We endoscopically or surgically treated 647 patients with gastric epithelial neoplasms in the last 5 years, with 7.7% (50/647) being H. pylori-na\u00efve. Among these, 43 FGA-RAs were diagnosed based on histologic and endoscopic features in 34 patients, who were all enrolled in this retrospective study. All lesions were observed by white-light endoscopy (WLE) and narrow-band imaging with magnification endoscopy (NBIME). We subsequently analyzed their endoscopic and microscopic features and patient characteristics. The patients were 22 males and 12 females aged 57\u00b123 years (mean\u00b12SD). WLE showed raspberry-like small polyps mimicking gastric hyperplastic polyps in the oxyntic gastric compartment (body/fundus). Multiple growths were confirmed in 20.6% (7/34) of the patients. NBIME revealed irregularly shaped papillary/gyrus-like microstructures with abnormal capillaries. Histologically, all lesions were intraepithelial neoplasms, and most of lesions (62.8%, 27/43) exhibited low-grade dysplasia. Immunohistochemically, neoplastic cells featured strong and diffuse MUC5AC expression, negative or very low MUC6 expression, and negative MUC2/CD10 expression. They also showed Ki-67 hyperexpression with a mean labeling index of 59.4\u00b148.7%. The coexistence of fundic gland polyps in the background mucosa was significantly higher in multiple FGA-RA cases than in solitary cases (100% vs. 55.5%, P< 0.05). FGA-RA is a newly suggested histologic variant of sporadic FGA whose occurrence is not rare in daily endoscopic practice.",

    "abstract": "Over one third of crops are animal pollinated, with insects being the largest group. In some crops, including strawberries, fruit yield, weight, quality, aesthetics and shelf life increase with insect pollination. Many crops are protected from extreme weather in polytunnels, but the impacts of polytunnels on insects are poorly understood. Polytunnels could reduce pollination services, especially if insects have access issues. Here we examine the distribution and activity of honeybees and non-honeybee wild insects on a commercial fruit farm. We evaluated whether insect distributions are impacted by flower type (strawberry; raspberry; weed), or distance from polytunnel edges. We compared passive pan-trapping and active quadrat observations to establish their suitability for monitoring insect distribution and behaviour on a farm. To understand the relative value of honeybees compared to other insects for strawberry pollination, the primary crop at the site, we enhanced our observations with video data analysed using insect tracking software to document the time spent by insects on flowers. The results show honeybees strongly prefer raspberry and weed flowers over strawberry flowers and that location within the polytunnel impacts insect distributions. Consistent with recent studies, we also show that pan-traps are ineffective to sample honeybee numbers. While the pan-traps and quadrat observations tend to suggest that investment in managed honeybees for strawberry pollination might be ineffective due to consistent low numbers within the crop, the camera data provides contrary evidence. Although honeybees were relatively scarce among strawberry crops, camera data shows they spent more time visiting flowers than other insects. Our results demonstrate that a commercial fruit farm is a complex ecosystem influencing pollinator diversity and abundance through a range of factors. We show that monitoring methods may differ in their valuation of relative contributions of insects to crop pollination.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone is a widely used flavor compound in food and cosmetic industry. Several processes for its biocatalytic production have already been described, but either with the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) or incomplete conversion of the variety of precursors that are available in nature. Such natural precursors are rhododendrol glycosides with different proportions of (R)- and (S)-rhododendrol depending on the origin. After hydrolysis of these rhododendrol glycosides, the formed rhododendrol enantiomers have to be oxidized to obtain the final product raspberry ketone. To be able to achieve a high conversion with different starting material, we assembled an alcohol dehydrogenase toolbox that can be accessed depending on the optical purity of the intermediate rhododendrol. This is demonstrated by converting racemic rhododendrol using a combination of (R)- and (S)-selective alcohol dehydrogenases together with a universal cofactor recycling system. Furthermore, we conducted a biocatalytic cascade reaction starting from naturally derived rhododendrol glycosides by the use of a glucosidase and an alcohol dehydrogenase to produce raspberry ketone in high yield.

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of COVID-19 is of vital demand. Several studies have been conducted to decide whether the chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans of patients indicate COVID-19. While these efforts resulted in successful classification systems, the design of a portable and cost-effective COVID-19 diagnosis system has not been addressed yet. The memory requirements of the current state-of-the-art COVID-19 diagnosis systems are not suitable for embedded systems due to the required large memory size of these systems (e.g., hundreds of megabytes). Thus, the current work is motivated to design a similar system with minimal memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a diagnosis system using a Raspberry Pi Linux embedded system. First, local features are extracted using local binary pattern (LBP) algorithm. Second, the global features are extracted from the chest X-ray or CT scans using multi-channel fractional-order Legendre-Fourier moments (MFrLFMs). Finally, the most significant features (local and global) are selected. The proposed system steps are integrated to fit the low computational and memory capacities of the embedded system. The proposed method has the smallest computational and memory resources,less than the state-of-the-art methods by two to three orders of magnitude, among existing state-of-the-art deep learning (DL)-based methods.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a common cause of death and disability. However, existing tools for TBI diagnosis are either subjective or require extensive clinical setup and expertise. The increasing affordability and reduction in the size of relatively high-performance computing systems combined with promising results from TBI related machine learning research make it possible to create compact and portable systems for early detection of TBI. This work describes a Raspberry Pi based portable, real-time data acquisition, and automated processing system that uses machine learning to efficiently identify TBI and automatically score sleep stages from a single-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. We discuss the design, implementation, and verification of the system that can digitize the EEG signal using an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) and perform real-time signal classification to detect the presence of mild TBI (mTBI). We utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and XGBoost based predictive models to evaluate the performance and demonstrate the versatility of the system to operate with multiple types of predictive models. We achieve a peak classification accuracy of more than 90% with a classification time of less than 1 s across 16-64 s epochs for TBI vs. control conditions. This work can enable the development of systems suitable for field use without requiring specialized medical equipment for early TBI detection applications and TBI research. Further, this work opens avenues to implement connected, real-time TBI related health and wellness monitoring systems.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of raspberry juice addition on the content of phenolic compounds and the antioxidant activity of wafers. The research was carried out on non-supplemented wafers (control) and wafers in which water was replaced with raspberry juice in the amount of 10%, 20%, 50%, 75% and 100%. The potential bioavailability of the phenolic compounds after in vitro digestion was also determined. As shown by the consumer assessment, wafers in which the water was replaced with 100% raspberry juice turned out to be the best variant of the enriched wafers. The content of total phenolic compounds, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and anthocyanins in the tested products increased with the increasing amount of raspberry juice added to the wafers. The fortification of the wafers with raspberry juice had a positive effect on the antioxidant activity, expressed as the ability to neutralize free radicals ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) and DPPH (di(phenyl)-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)iminoazanium), the ability to chelate iron ions, and as the reduction power. The simulated digestion increased the content of phenolic compounds and increased the antioxidant activity of the wafers. The ability to inhibit lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (i.e., enzymes involved in the induction of inflammation), varied and depended on both the amount of raspberry juice added and the type of extract.",

After 4 weeks, blood samples were obtained and left testes were removed and prepared for histopathological studies. Serum levels of Luteinizing hormone (LH), Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, Nitric oxide (NO), and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity level were assayed.

Data were analyzed using ANOVA (one-way analysis of variance).\nSerum levels of LH, FSH and MDA significantly increased in diabetic rats, however, treatment with the extract significantly reversed the alterations. Serum levels of testosterone and NO, activity of SOD and CAT, and sperm number and motility significantly decreased and severe destruction of testicular histology was observed in diabetic animals while treatment with the extract significantly reversed the pathologic alterations observed in diabetic rats. According to the results, 100 and 200 mg/kg of the extract were able to effectively reverse the diabetes complications.\nOur findings demonstrated that the fruit extract of raspberry has protective effects on male reproductive system in diabetic rats partially due to its improving effects on NO system, and SOD and CAT activity.",

    "abstract": "We report on a simple method for an active position stabilization of an atomic cloud trapped in a magneto-optical trap operating on the narrow 182 kHz intercombination line of atomic ytterbium. Our method makes use of the significant sensitivity of the position of a narrow-line magneto-optical trap (MOT) on the laser frequency. After in situ detection of the MOT position using a Pi Camera, an error signal is generated by a Raspberry Pi, which is directly fed back onto the laser frequency. Thus, perturbations of the MOT position, e.g., due to drifts of the Zerodur cavity to which the MOT laser is stabilized or the ambient magnetic field, can be compensated directly. Our method allows for long-term stabilization of the MOT position on a 10 \u00b5m scale and thus improves loading of a tightly focused optical trap.",

In this study, the components of carotenoids and genes/proteins involved in their biosynthesis were investigated during four fruit ripening phases via LC-MS/MS. Zeaxanthin, \u03b2-citraurin and its esters, first identified in Rubus, gradually accumulated during fruit maturation. These compounds, rather than anthocyanins, were responsible for the ripe fruit coloration. In carotenoid metabolism, upstream synthesis genes of RcPSY2 (CL1406.Contig2), RcPDS1 (CL7625.Contig2), RcZDS1 (CL590.Contig6) and RcCRTISO1 (CL6919.Contig2) were up-regulated in gene/protein expression to accelerate carotene biosynthesis. Downstream genes of RcLUT5CHYB/CYP97A (CL8884.Contig3) and RcCHYB/BCH (CL7966.Contig1) were up-regulated in gene/protein expression, while RcCHYE/CYP97C (CL9380.Contig1/2) were maintained at low levels. RcLCYE (Unigene19570) was down-regulated while RcLCYB (CL7586.Contig1) was up-regulated and then down-regulated. These differential gene/protein expressions between LCYB and LCYE, and between CHYE and CHYB led to zeaxanthin accumulation by elevating its biosynthetic enzymes and lowering enzymes for lutein biosynthesis. In apocarotenoid biosynthesis, RcCCD (CL1310.Contig3) was up-regulated in gene/protein expression, which raised the content of \u03b2-citraurin and its esters. Additionally, these genes/proteins diverged into different subgroups with distinct pattens of expression, suggesting their difference in function. For example, RcPSY1/3, RcZDS2, and RcCRTISO2/3 genes were expressed at very low levels, suggesting that they may be active in other tissues rather than in fruit. The mechanism of zeaxanthin and \u03b2-citraurin biosynthesis is responsible for fruit coloration, which is completely novel to Rubus.",

    "abstract": "This study examined, the effect of chemically extracted raspberry pomace on the thermal stability, mechanical properties, flammability, chemical structure and processing of poly(vinyl chloride). It was observed that the pomace in this study was used to extract naphtha, thereby permitting the removal of bio-oil as a factor preventing the obtaining of homogeneous composites. Furthermore, adding 20% raspberry pomace filler after extraction extended the thermal stability time for the composites by about 30%. It was observed that composite density, impact strength, and tensile strength values decreased significantly with increasing concentrations of filler in the PVC matrix. At the same time, their modulus of elasticity and Shore hardness increased. All tested composites were characterized by a good burning resistance with a flammability rating of V0 according to the UL94 test. Adding 20 to 40% of a natural filler to the PVC matrix made it possible to obtain composites for the production of flame resistant elements that emitted less hydrogen chloride under fire conditions while ensuring good rigidity.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is closely linked to various diseases, and many studies have been conducted to determine how to reduce this stress. In particular, efforts are being made to find potential antioxidants from natural products. Studies have shown that raspberry ketone (RK; 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone) has various pharmacological activities. This review summarizes the antioxidant activities of RK and their underlying mechanisms. In several experimental models, it was proven that RK exhibits antioxidant properties through increasing total antioxidant capacity (TAC); upregulating antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT); and improving lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, research about RK's antioxidant activities is directly or indirectly related to its other various physiological activities. Further studies at the clinical level will be able to verify the value of RK as an effective antioxidant, functional health food, and therapeutic agent.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, nonalcoholic fatty liver disorders have become one of the most common liver pathologies; therefore, it is necessary to investigate the dietary compounds that may support the regulation of liver metabolism and related inflammatory processes. The present study examines the effect of raspberry polyphenolic extract (RE) combined with fructo-oligosaccharides (FOSs) or pectins (PECs) on caecal microbial fermentation, liver lipid metabolism and inflammation in rats with fatty liver induced by an obesogenic diet. The combination of RE with FOSs or PECs reduced the production of short-chain fatty acids in the caecum. RE combined with FOSs exerted the most favourable effects on liver lipid metabolism by decreasing liver fat, cholesterol, triglyceride content and hepatic steatosis. RE and FOSs reduced lobular and portal inflammatory cell infiltration and IL-6 plasma levels. These effects might be related to a decrease in the hepatic expressions of PPAR\u03b3 and ANGPTL4. In conclusion, PECs and FOSs enhanced the effects of RE against disorders related to nonalcoholic fatty liver; however, the most effective dietary treatment in the regulation of liver lipid metabolism and inflammation caused by an obesogenic diet was the combination of RE with FOSs.",

    "abstract": "Spotted wing drosophila (SWD) causes significant economic loss in fruit crops to growers worldwide. There is immediate need for efficacious and selective monitoring tools that can detect infestations early. Previously, volatile organic compounds derived from apple were studied and a quinary chemical component blend (QB) was identified as the key SWD attractant in a blueberry orchard in the United States. This study's aim was to determine whether previously observed QB efficacy, selectivity, and early detection levels could be attained within raspberry and cherry fields in the USA and Europe. Results demonstrated that sticky trap baited QB dispenser provided earlier SWD detection potential than the usually adopted apple cider vinegar (ACV) trap. The number of SWD captured/trap by QB baited trapping systems was significantly lower than that of the ACV trap. However, percent SWD/trap of QB baited traps was same within cherry. Lower non-target capture will save farmer/grower's labor and time allocated to traps installation and drosophila species identification. Within the USA, SWD selectivity of QB baited liquid traps was consistently greater than sticky trap in raspberry field, suggesting that the QB dispenser can be an alternative to the standard ACV lure and that trap design could improve selectivity further.",

    "abstract": "Phenylpropanoid including raspberry ketone, is a kind of important natural plant product and widely used in pharmaceuticals, chemicals, cosmetics, and healthcare products. Bioproduction of phenylpropanoid in Escherichia coli and other microbial cell factories is an attractive approach considering the low phenylpropanoid contents in plants. However, it is usually difficult to produce high titer phenylpropanoid production when fermentation using glucose as carbon source. Developing novel bioprocess using alternative sources might provide a solution to this problem. In this study, typical phenylpropanoid raspberry ketone was used as the target product to develop a biosynthesis pathway for phenylpropanoid production from fatty acids, a promising alternative low-cost feedstock.\nA raspberry ketone biosynthesis module was developed and optimized by introducing 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), benzalacetone synthase (BAS), and raspberry ketone reductase (RZS) in Escherichia coli strains CR1-CR4. Then strain CR5 was developed by introducing raspberry ketone biosynthesis module into a fatty acids-utilization chassis FA09 to achieve production of raspberry ketone from fatty acids feedstock. However, the production of raspberry ketone was still limited by the low biomass and unable to substantiate whole-cell bioconversion process. Thus, a process by coordinately using fatty-acids and glycerol was developed. In addition, we systematically screened and optimized fatty acids-response promoters. The optimized promoter Pfrd3 was then successfully used for the efficient expression of key enzymes of raspberry ketone biosynthesis module during bioconversion from fatty acids. The final engineered strain CR8 could efficiently produce raspberry ketone repeatedly using bioconversion from fatty acids feedstock strategy, and was able to produce raspberry ketone to a concentration of 180.94 mg/L from soybean oil in a 1-L fermentation process.\nMetabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains were successfully developed for raspberry ketone production from fatty acids using several strategies, including optimization of bioconversion process and fine-tuning key enzyme expression. This study provides an essential reference to establish the low-cost biological manufacture of phenylpropanoids compounds.",

    "abstract": "Childbearing women have been using various herbs to assist with pregnancy, labour and birth for centuries. One of the most common is raspberry leaf. The evidence base for the use of raspberry leaf is however under-developed. It is incumbent on midwives and other maternity care providers to provide women with evidence-based information so they can make informed choices. The aim of this study was to review the research literature to identify the evidence base on the biophysical effects, safety and efficacy of raspberry leaf in pregnancy.\nA systematic, integrative review was undertaken. Six databases were searched to identify empirical research papers published in peer reviewed journals including in vitro, in vivo, human and animal studies. The search included the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection and AMED. Identified studies were appraised independently by two reviewers using the MMAT appraisal instrument. An integrative approach was taken to analysis.\nThirteen studies were included. Five were laboratory studies using animal and human tissue, two were experiments using animals, and six were human studies. Included studies were published between 1941 and 2016. Raspberry leaf has been shown to have biophysical effects on animal and human smooth muscle including the uterus. Toxity was demonstrated when high doses were administered intravenously or intaperitoneally in animal studies. Human studies have not shown any harm or benefit though one study demonstrated a clinically meaningful (though non-statistically significant) reduction in length of second stage and augmentation of labour in women taking raspberry leaf.\nMany women use raspberry leaf in pregnancy to facilitate labour and birth. The evidence base supporting the use of raspeberry leaf in pregnancy is weak and further research is needed to address the question of raspberry leaf's effectiveness.",

This device is based on a Raspberry Pi computer, stepper motors, commercial optomechanics and electronic devices, and the open-source machine learning algorithm M-LOOP. We provide schematic drawings for the custom hardware necessary to operate the device and discuss diagnostic techniques to determine the performance. The beam auto-aligning device has been used to improve the alignment of a laser beam into a single-mode optical fiber from manually optimized fiber alignment, with an iteration time of typically 20\u00a0minutes. We present example data of one such measurement to illustrate device performance.",

    "abstract": "Diets rich in fruit and vegetables are associated with a decreased incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) due, in part, to the bioactive (poly)phenolic components and their microbiota-mediated metabolites. This study investigated how such compounds, derived from ingested raspberries in the gastrointestinal tract, may exert protective effects by reducing DNA damage. Ileal fluids collected pre- and post-consumption of 300\u00a0g of raspberries by ileostomists (n\u00a0=\u00a011) were subjected to 24\u00a0h ex vivo fermentation with fecal inoculum to simulate interaction with colonic microbiota. The impact of fermentation on (poly)phenolics in ileal fluid was determined and the bioactivity of ileal fluids pre- and post fermentation investigated. (Poly)phenolic compounds including sanguiin H-6, sanguiin H-10 and cyanidin-3-O-sophoroside decreased significantly during fermentation while, in contrast, microbial catabolites, including 3-(3'-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and benzoic acid increased significantly. The post-raspberry ileal fermentate from 9 of the 11 ileostomates significantly decreased DNA damage (~30%) in the CCD 841 CoN normal cell line using an oxidative challenge COMET assay. The raspberry ileal fermentates also modulated gene expression of the nuclear factor 2-antioxidant responsive element (Nrf2-ARE) pathway involved in oxidative stress cytoprotection, namely Nrf2, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone-1 and heme oxygenase-1. Four of the phenolic catabolites were assessed individually, each significantly reducing DNA damage from an oxidative challenge over a physiologically relevant 10-100\u00a0\u03bcM range. They also induced a differential pattern of expression of key genes in the Nrf2-ARE pathway in CCD 841 CoN cells. The study indicates that the colon-available raspberry (poly)phenols and their microbial-derived catabolites may play a role in protection against CRC in vivo.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the development of biocompatible oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsions based on polyglycerol esters, as promising carriers for natural actives: red raspberry seed oil-RO and hydro-glycolic fruit extracts from red raspberry-RE and French oak-FE. Nanoemulsions were obtained via phase inversion composition (PIC) method at room temperature by dilution of microemulsion phase, confirmed by visual appearance, percentage of transmittance, microscopic, rheological and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) investigations. The results have shown that the basic RO-loaded formulation could be further enriched with hydro-glycolic fruit extracts from red raspberry or French oak, while keeping a semi-transparent appearance due to the fine droplet size (Z-ave: 50 to 70 nm, PDI value \u2264 0.1). The highest antioxidant activity (~92% inhibition of the DPPH radical) was achieved in the formulation containing both lipophilic (RO) and hydrophilic antioxidants (FE), due to their synergistic effect. The nanoemulsion carrier significantly increased the selective cytotoxic effect of RO towards malignant melanoma (Fem-X) cells, compared to normal human keratinocytes (HaCaT). In vivo study on human volunteers showed satisfactory safety profiles and significant improvement in skin hydration during 2 h after application for all nanoemulsions. Therefore, polyglycerol ester-based nanoemulsions can be promoted as effective carriers for red raspberry seed oil and/or hydro-glycolic fruit extracts in topical formulations intended for skin protection and hydration.",

    "abstract": "Chest examination by auscultation is essential in patients with COVID-19, especially those with poor respiratory conditions, such as severe pneumonia and respiratory dysfunction, and intensive cases who are intubated and whose breathing is assisted with a ventilator. However, proper auscultation of these patients is difficult when medical workers wear personal protective equipment and when it is necessary to minimize contact with patients.\nThe objective of our study was to design and develop a low-cost electronic stethoscope enabling ear-contactless auscultation and digital storage of data for further analysis. The clinical feasibility of our device was assessed in comparison to a standard electronic stethoscope.\nWe developed a prototype of the ear-contactless electronic stethoscope, called Auscul Pi, powered by Raspberry Pi and Python. Our device enables real-time capture of auscultation sounds with a microspeaker instead of an earpiece, and it can store data files for later analysis. We assessed the feasibility of using this stethoscope by detecting abnormal heart and respiratory sounds from 8 patients with heart failure or structural heart diseases and from 2 healthy volunteers and by comparing the results with those from a 3M Littmann electronic stethoscope.\nWe were able to conveniently operate Auscul Pi and precisely record the patients' auscultation sounds. Auscul Pi showed similar real-time recording and playback performance to the Littmann stethoscope. The phonocardiograms of data obtained with the two stethoscopes were consistent and could be aligned with the cardiac cycles of the corresponding electrocardiograms. Pearson correlation analysis of amplitude data from the two types of phonocardiograms showed that Auscul Pi was correlated with the Littmann stethoscope with coefficients of 0.3245-0.5570 for healthy participants (P<.001) and of 0.3449-0.5138 among 4 patients (P<.001).\nAuscul Pi can be used for auscultation in clinical practice by applying real-time ear-contactless playback followed by quantitative analysis. Auscul Pi may allow accurate auscultation when medical workers are wearing protective suits and have difficulties in examining patients with COVID-19.\nChiCTR.org.cn ChiCTR2000033830; http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=54971.",

    "abstract": "In our investigation, the chemical composition and bioactive potential of leaf buds of raspberry, blackberry, and a raspberry-blackberry hybrid were determined. Antioxidant and antimicrobial properties were tested in water (W), ethanol-water (EW), and glycerol-water (GW) extracts from the buds. These plant organs contain relatively large amounts of minerals, especially Fe. The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) measured by the ABTS and DPPH methods ranged from 2.86 to 12.19 and 6.75 to 24.26 mmol per 100 g fresh weight (FW) of buds, respectively. TAC values were generally higher in the raspberry than in the case of blackberry and raspberry-blackberry hybrid extracts. The antioxidant properties of the extracts were strongly positively correlated with their content of total phenolic (TP). No such relationship was noted for ascorbic acid (AA), whose concentration in all extracts was at a similarly low level. Antioxidant properties determined in vitro were confirmed for the GW extract from raspberry leaf buds in biological test based on the growth parameters of \u0394",

    "abstract": "Whole red raspberry polyphenols (RRW), including ellagic acid, and their gut-derived metabolite, urolithin A (UroA), attenuate inflammation and confer health benefits. Although results from recent studies indicate that polyphenols and UroA also provide neuroprotective effects, these compounds differ in their bioavailability and may, therefore, have unique effects on limiting neuroinflammation. Accordingly, we aimed to compare the neuroprotective effects of RRW and UroA on BV-2 microglia under both 3 h and 12 and 24 h inflammatory conditions. In inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ATP stimulation after 3 h, RRW and UroA suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression and regulated the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway. UroA also reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression and promoted M2 microglial polarization. During inflammatory conditions induced by either 12 or 24 h stimulation with LPS, UroA-but not RRW-dampened pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression and suppressed JNK/c-Jun signaling. Taken together, these results demonstrate that RRW and its gut-derived metabolite UroA differentially regulate neuroprotective responses in microglia during 3 h versus 12 and 24 h inflammatory conditions.",

    "abstract": "Consumption of red raspberries has been reported to exert acute beneficial effects on postprandial glycemia, insulinemia, triglyceridemia, and cytokine levels in metabolically disturbed subjects. In a two-arm parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial, 59 subjects with overweight or abdominal obesity and with slight hyperinsulinemia or hypertriglyceridemia were randomized to consume 280 g/day of frozen raspberries or to maintain their usual diet for 8 weeks. Primary analyses measured metabolic differences between the groups. Secondary analyses performed with omics tools in the intervention group assessed blood gene expression and plasma metabolomic changes following the raspberry supplementation. The intervention did not significantly affect plasma insulin, glucose, inflammatory marker concentrations, nor blood pressure. Following the supplementation, 43 genes were differentially expressed, and several functional pathways were enriched, a major portion of which were involved in the regulation of cytotoxicity, immune cell trafficking, protein signal transduction, and interleukin production. In addition, 10 serum metabolites were found significantly altered, among which \u03b2-alanine, trimethylamine N-oxide, and bioactive lipids. Although the supplementation had no meaningful metabolic effects, these results highlight the impact of a diet rich in raspberry on the immune function and phospholipid metabolism, thus providing novel insights into potential immune-metabolic pathways influenced by regular raspberry consumption.",

    "abstract": "Gastric adenocarcinoma of foveolar type (GA-FV) is a raspberry-shaped gastric cancer (RSGC) and garners much attention as H. pylori (Hp)-uninfected gastric cancer. However, the classification and clinicopathological and endoscopic features of RSGCs in Hp-uninfected patients are poorly defined. We designed a new histopathological classification of RSGC and compared them via endoscopic and clinicopathological characteristics.\nFrom 996 patients with early gastric cancers resected by endoscopy in our hospital, we studied 24 RSGC lesions from 21 (2.4%) Hp-uninfected patients. RSGCs were classified into 3 histological types as follows: GA-FV (n = 19), gastric adenocarcinoma of fundic gland type (GA-FG, n = 2), and gastric adenocarcinoma of fundic gland mucosa type (GA-FGM, n = 3). Most of the lesions were found at the greater curvature of the upper or middle third of the stomach. GA-FV lesions were homogeneously reddish and frequently accompanied with a whitish area around the tumor and an irregular microvascular (MV) pattern; these features were confirmed histopathologically by the presence of homogeneous neoplastic foveolar epithelium with foveolar hyperplasia around the tumors. GA-FG lesions might be heterogeneously reddish with a submucosal tumor shape and regular MV pattern; these were confirmed by the presence of covered or mixed nonneoplastic epithelium on deeper regions of tumors. GA-FGM lesions might be homogeneously reddish and occasionally had a submucosal tumor shape and irregular MV pattern; these were confirmed by the presence of homogeneous neoplastic foveolar epithelium on deeper regions of the tumors. Key Messages: RSGCs in Hp-uninfected patients are classified into 3 histopathological types. For accurate diagnosis of RSGCs, it may be necessary to fully understand endoscopic features of these lesions based on these histological characteristics and to take a precise biopsy.",

    "abstract": "The morphology of surfaces critically influences their interaction with the surrounding phase. Herein, we report a modular approach for the synthesis of organic-inorganic raspberry-, strawberry-, and seedpod-like particles to template the porosity of superficially porous particles. Divinylbenzene (DVB) microspheres were employed as core particles, which were modified with polar and nonpolar polymer shells. Subsequently, silica nanoparticle templates were covalently tethered to said particles. Further grafting of polymer shells and subsequent template removal yielded superficially porous core-shell particles. In addition, we introduce a facile procedure for the synthesis of superficially porous particles without distinguishable core-shell morphology. Organic seedpod-like particles were prepared from DVB and silica templates, yielding superficially porous particles after template removal. The surface morphology of the templated particles was investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to prove the chemical modification of the particle surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Binary transition metals can facilitate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) through the synergistic integration of different electrochemical properties. To determine binary transition metals that are highly active, Greely et al. conducted a simulation of 256 different binary transition metals. They demonstrated that BiPt, PtRu, AsPt, SbPt, BiRh, RhRe, PtRe, AsRu, IrRu, RhRu, IrRe, and PtRh could be used as efficient electrocatalysts for HER. However, only few of them are synthesized and used as electrocatalysts. In this work, we report the synthesis of the raspberry-like antimony-platinum (SbPt) nanoparticles (NPs) via a colloidal nanocrystal synthesis. These NPs exhibited efficient activity with a low overpotential of 27\u00a0mV to reach 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm",

    "abstract": "Cyclophosphamide (CP) was found to have a potential toxic effect on lung tissues. Raspberry ketones (RKs) are natural antioxidant chemicals isolated from red raspberries (Rubus ideaus). They are commonly used for weight loss and obesity. The current study aimed to evaluate the possible protective effects of RKs against lung toxicity induced by CP. Mice were allocated into six groups: (1) control group; (2) CP group: received a single intraperitoneal dose of CP (150\u2009mg/kg, i.p.); and (3-6) mice were pre-treated orally with different doses of RKs (25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) for 14 consecutive days, respectively, before the administration of an intraperitoneal dose of CP (150 mg/kg, i.p.). Mice were then sacrificed under anesthesia, then lungs were removed for histopathological and biochemical investigations. A single dose of CP markedly altered the levels of some oxidative stress biomarkers and resulted in the fragmentation of DNA in lung homogenates. Histological examination of CP-treated mice demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage that involved apparent hyalinization of membranes, thickening of inter alveolar septa, and proliferation of type II pneumocytes. The immunohistochemical results of CP-treated mice revealed strongly positive Bax and weakly positive proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining reactivity of the nuclei of the lining epithelium of the bronchioles and alveoli. CP activated the cyclooxygenase-2/nuclear factor-kappa B pathway. However, pre-treatment with RKs significantly attenuated CP-evoked alterations in the previously mentioned parameters, highlighting their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic potential. RKs may be suggested to be a potential candidate to ameliorate CP-induced pulmonary toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Video acquisition and analysis have become integral parts of scientific research. Two major components of a video acquisition system are the choice of camera and the acquisition software. A vast variety of cameras are available on the market. Turnkey multi-camera synchronous acquisition software, however, is not as widely available. For prototyping applications, the Raspberry Pi (RPi) has been widely utilized due to many factors, including cost. There are implementations for video acquisition and preview from a single RPi camera, including one implementation released by the RPi organization itself. However, there are no multi-camera acquisition solutions for the RPi. This paper presents an open-source digital video recorder (DVR) system for the popular RPi camera. The DVR is simple to setup and use for acquisition with a single camera or multiple cameras. In the case of multiple cameras, the acquisition is synchronized between cameras. The DVR comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow previewing the camera streams, setting recording parameters, and associating \"names\" to cameras. The acquisition code as well as the DVR GUI are written in Python. The open-source software also includes a GUI for playback of recorded video. The versatility of the DVR is demonstrated with a life science research application involving high-throughput monitoring of fruit-flies.",

    "abstract": "In the field of functional nanomaterials, core-satellite nanoclusters have recently elicited great interest due to their unique optoelectronic properties. However, core-satellite synthetic routes to date are hampered by delicate and multistep reaction conditions and no practical method has been reported for the ordering of these structures onto a surface monolayer. Herein we show a reproducible and simplified thin film process to fabricate bimetallic raspberry nanoclusters using block copolymer (BCP) lithography. The fabricated inorganic raspberry nanoclusters consisted of a \u223c36 nm alumina core decorated with \u223c15 nm Au satellites after infusing multilayer BCP nanopatterns. A series of cylindrical BCPs with different molecular weights allowed us to dial in specific nanodot periodicities (from 30 to 80 nm). Highly ordered BCP nanopatterns were then selectively infiltrated with alumina and Au species to develop multi-level bimetallic raspberry features. Microscopy and X-ray reflectivity analysis were used at each fabrication step to gain further mechanistic insights and understand the infiltration process. Furthermore, grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering studies of infiltrated films confirmed the excellent order and vertical orientation over wafer scale areas of Al",

    "abstract": "The sterile insect technique (SIT) and male annihilation technique (MAT) are important tools for the control of Queensland fruit fly (Q-fly), Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Diptera: Tephritidae), a major insect pest of horticultural crops in Australia. In MAT, mature Q-fly males are attracted to a toxic bait using Cuelure, a synthetic analog of raspberry ketone (RK). Substantial improvements in control could be achieved by simultaneous use of SIT and MAT, but this requires suppression of the Cuelure response in released sterile flies. Recent studies report that prerelease feeding with RK during the first 48 h after emergence can reduce the response of mature Q-fly males to Cuelure, but the mechanism underpinning this is unknown. Here, to test whether reduced sensory sensitivity to Cuelure is involved, we evaluated the effects of RK supplements, adult diet (yeast-supplemented diet throughout adult stage vs yeast-supplemented diet only for 48 h), and age on electroantennogram (EAG) and electropalpogram (EPG) responses of Q-flies to Cuelure stimuli. EAG responses did not vary with RK supplements, sex, or age of Q-flies fed yeast-supplemented diet throughout the adult stage, but the responses of Q-flies fed other diet regime decreased with age. EPG responses of both sexes of Q-flies were affected by RK supplements, age, and their interaction, but without patterns that might indicate reduced maxillary palp response of RK supplemented flies to Cuelure. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that reduced Cuelure response of male Q-flies fed RK supplements is explained by reduced electrophysiological response in antennae or maxillary palps.",

    "abstract": "Red raspberries (RRB) are high in anthocyanin- and ellagitannin- type (poly)phenols. This study aimed to investigate the effect of 4-week RRB supplementation on (poly)phenolic metabolism in adults with prediabetes and insulin-resistance (PreDM-IR); and whether adding fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), prebiotics, would augment the microbial metabolites of RRB (poly)phenols. In a randomized crossover clinical trial, subjects (n = 35: PreDM-IR, n = 25; healthy Reference group, n = 10) consumed 1 cup RRB (fresh weight equivalence) per day and RRB with 8 g FOS per day each for 4 weeks in random order separated by 4-week washout. Plasma and urinary (poly)phenolic metabolites were characterized after (0-24h) consuming a RRB-based test drink (2 cups RRB) at baseline/week 0 and again after 4-week supplementations. A total of 123 (poly)phenolic metabolites were quantified. After 4-week RRB supplementation, several metabolite groups were significantly increased (",

    "abstract": "Chronic neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative disorders has been reported to be prevented by dietary components. Particularly, dietary (poly)phenols have been identified as having anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective actions, and their ingestion is considered a major preventive factor for such disorders. To assess the relation between (poly)phenol classes and their bioactivity, we used five different raspberry genotypes, which were markedly different in their (poly)phenol profiles within a similar matrix. In addition, gastro-intestinal bio-accessible fractions were produced, which simulate the (poly)phenol metabolites that may be absorbed after digestion, and evaluated for anti-inflammatory potential using LPS-stimulated microglia. Interestingly, the fraction from genotype 2J19 enriched in ellagitannins, their degradation products and ellagic acid, attenuated pro-inflammatory markers and mediators CD40, NO, TNF-\u03b1, and intracellular superoxide via NF-\u03baB, MAPK and NFAT pathways. Importantly, it also increased the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. These effects contrasted with fractions richer in anthocyanins, suggesting that ellagitannins and its derivatives are major anti-inflammatory (poly)phenols and promising compounds to alleviate neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry leaf mottle virus (RLMV) in Europe has been associated with raspberry mosaic disease (Martin et al. 2013) and crumbly fruit disease (Quito-Avila et al. 2014) in red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) beside Rubus yellow net virus (RYNV) and Black raspberry necrosis virus (BRNV). RLMV has also been reported infecting blackberry (Jones and McGavin 1998; Thekke-Veetil et al. 2016). A survey of virus diseases was conducted from 2016 to 2018 in 34 raspberry commercial plantations in Central and southeastern Poland. Some of the plants showed chlorotic spots, vein yellows, mosaic patterns and deformation of leaves and fruits. Leaf samples from 146 plants were tested using RT-PCR for RLMV, RYNV, BRNV, Raspberry vein chlorosis virus (RVCV), Raspberry leaf blotch virus (RLBV), and Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV). The pairs of primers CPhF and CPhR (Tzanetakis et al. 2007) as well as 1436F and 1437R (McGavin and MacFarlane 2010) were used to amplify a 452-bp fragment of the coat protein homologue (CPh) gene and a 681-bp of the 1 a helicase gene, respectively. RT-PCR products were obtained for five samples from cultivars: Malling Promise (MPrOK1 and MPrOk2; plantation A), Canby (CanKop; plantation B), Polka (PolKop; plantation B) and Malling Seedling (MSeWa; plantation C) grown in southeastern Poland. MPrOK1 and MSeWa were co-infected with RYNV while the other three samples were mixed infected with RBDV. Each of these plants showed chlorotic spots and mosaic symptoms of different intensity, leaf deformation and reduced growth. The RLMV-specific amplicons obtained for all five positive samples were directly sequenced at Genomed company, Warsaw, Poland. The obtained sequences were aligned using ClustalW of the Lasergene 7.1 software (DNASTAR Inc., USA) and were compared with sequences available in GenBank using the BLASTn algorithm. The identity of nucleotide (nt) sequences of Cph gene of RLMV isolates found in Poland was revealed. They shared 97.7% and 99% nt sequence similarity with 'HCRL Glen Clova' from USA (DQ357218) and 'SCRI stock' isolate from United Kingdom (FN391551) strains respectively The nucleotide sequence of isolates from Poland indicates a closer relationship with the strain found in UK. However, the amino acid (aa) sequence of both reference strains was identical and shared 99.2% identity with the corresponding fragment of the isolates from Poland. The representative sequence of PolKop isolate was deposited in GenBank under accession No. MT241265. The similarity of nucleotide sequence of the 1 a helicase gene ranged from 98.5% (between MseWa and four other isolates) to 100% (between MPrOk1 and MPrOk2). The amino acids sequences of MPrOk1, MPrOk2 and MSeWa isolates were identical whereas they shared 99.5% similarity with CanKop and PolKop isolates. The nt and aa sequences within this region of all five isolates were in 98% homologous with the sequences of 'HCRL Glen Clova' strain. Nucleotide sequences of the 1 a helicase gene of the CanKop, PolKop, MseWa, MPrOk1, MPrOk2 isolates were deposited in GenBank (acc. Nos. MT847633-MT8347637). Considering the low incidence of RLMV (five out of 146 positively tested), it can be assumed that there is no emergency of the RLMV large-scale occurrence in Poland. However, as RLMV is transmitted by Amphorophora idaei aphids found in our country, infected plants near raspberry plantations may play an important role in virus spread. This is the first report of RLMV infecting red raspberry in Poland.

    "abstract": "Raspberries have been reported to contain abundant anthocyanins and other active compounds. To extract anthocyanins from raspberries more efficiently, a novel procedure of ultrasound-assisted deep eutectic solvent extraction (UADESE) was proposed in this paper. The extraction process was optimized by response surface methodology coupled with a genetic algorithm. The optimum extraction parameters to achieve the highest yield of anthocyanins 1.378 \u00b1 0.009 mg/g from raspberry powder via UADESE were obtained at a water content of 29%, ultrasonic power of 210 W, extraction temperature of 51 \u00b0C and extraction time of 32 min. The AB-8 macroporous resin combined with the high-speed counter current chromatography (HSCCC) method were further used to isolate and purify the anthocyanins extracts obtained under optimum extraction conditions, and the structure of purified anthocyanins components were identified by UV-Visible spectrophotometer (UV-Vis), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS), ",

The absence of protection at the interface makes it easy for the attackers to take control of the IMDs. Thus, protection of wireless interface has become mandatory in IMDs during key agreement schemes. To secure the key agreement scheme, the most practical light weight bio-cryptosystem schemes popularly known as fuzzy vault (FV) is implemented. The most computationally intensive task in the FV scheme is the chaff point generation process, used for hiding the secret key and valid point inside the vault. Thus, a Raspberry Pi implemented with MATLAB simulation and communication of physiological signal based fast chaff point generation (RPSC) algorithm for WBAN. RPSC algorithm reduced the number of candidate chaff points in the chaff point generation and reduced the overall execution time. The RPSC algorithm has an algorithm complexity of O(n",

    "abstract": "In this study, we carried out a comparative evaluation of antiaging and anti-melanogenesis activities of raspberry extracts (Rubus occidentalis L.) according to their stage of ripening (uRo: unripe raspberry, Ro: ripe raspberry), and analyzed the active component (ellagic acid) present in these extracts. Our results showed higher inhibitory effects of the uRo extract in terms of elastase and collagenase activities than Ro extract. In the CCD-986sk cells, uRo extract significantly inhibited MMP-1 activity by 18% and increased the rate of type 1 pro-collagen synthesis by 25%. Besides, treatment with uRo extract significantly inhibited \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-induced melanin synthesis and tyrosinase activity in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. Overall, uRo was a more potent mediator of antiaging and anti-melanogenesis effects than Ro extract. Further analysis showed that the functional effects of uRo could be attributed to its 18.5 times higher ellagic acid content than that in Ro extract. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study reported the differential effect of the raspberry extracts depending on their stage of ripening. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study to report the antiaging, anti-wrinkle, and anti-pigmentation effects of the uRo extracts. We showed that the extracts from the uRo have an overall better antiaging and skin-whitening effect than ripe ones. The effects were attributed to high ellagic acid content in uRo. We believed that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because the outcome of the study has both, cosmetic as well as therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "This study presents the design and implementation of a home automation system that focuses on the use of ordinary electrical appliances for remote control using Raspberry Pi and relay circuits and does not use expensive IP-based devices. Common Lights, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), fans, and other electronic devices are among the appliances that can be used in this system. A smartphone app is designed that helps the user to design the smart home to his actual home via easy and interactive drag & drop option. The system provides control over the appliances via both the local network and remote access. Data logging over the Microsoft Azure cloud database ensures system recovery in case of gateway failure and data record for lateral use. Periodical notifications also help the user to optimize the usage of home appliances. Moreover, the user can set his preferences and the appliances are auto turned off and on to meet user-specific requirements. Raspberry Pi acting as the server maintains the database of each appliance. HTTP web interface and apache server are used for communication between the android app and raspberry pi. With a 5v relay circuit and micro-processor Raspberry Pi, the proposed system is low-cost, energy-efficient, easy to operate, and affordable for low-income houses.",

    "abstract": "Lignins of non-woody fast-growing plants cause high interest in recent time as a potential source of raw materials for biorefining. Studying of the lignin structure in shrubs will allow obtaining the information about processes of biosynthesis of these plants and developing methods of their delignification for bioprocessing industry. We studied the structure of raspberry dioxane lignin (Rubus idaeus L.) using various spectroscopic methods, including FT-IR and NMR (1D and 2D) for various nuclei. Also, we used gel permeation chromatography and elemental analysis. It is obtained that raspberry dioxane lignin has relatively wide polydispersity, with Mw/Mn\u00a0=\u00a02.6, and a relatively lower molecular weight (Mw\u00a0=\u00a05111\u00a0g/mol) due to low molecular weight oligolignols.

    "abstract": "The major aroma-active compounds in clear red raspberry juice were identified by molecular sensory science approaches. Thirty-one aroma-active compounds were identified using detection frequency analysis and aroma extract dilution analysis. Among them, 18 volatiles with aroma activity in red raspberry were identified for the first time, while 14 volatiles with odor activity values (OAVs)\u00a0\u2265\u00a01 were confirmed as the major aroma-active compounds. Three C6 aldehydes showed the highest detection frequencies of 8, and \u03b2-ionone exhibited the highest OAV of 9507 and flavor dilution factor of 512, which indicated that the floral and grassy note could be dominant in overall aroma. Quantitative descriptive analysis suggested that the grassy, floral, woody, and caramel-like notes can be simulated using aroma recombination model 1. Electronic nose analysis also demonstrated that model 1 had closer similarity to the original juice than others. The combination strategy used here would help improve the knowledge of red raspberry aroma.",

    "abstract": "Heterocrossa rubophaga, the raspberry bud moth, is a pest of commercial Rubus berry crops and wild Rubus species. Its pheromone was initially identified as a single component, (7Z)-nonadecen-11-one. Here we report further investigation of this carposinid pheromone including volatile collection, gland extraction, mass spectrometry, microchemical analysis, electrophysiology and field testing. The alkene (7Z)-tricosene was identified from female gland extracts and the synthetic compound gave antennal responses from the male moth. Field testing of (7Z)-tricosene showed that it was unattractive alone but in combination with (7Z)-nonadecen-11-one it more than doubled male moth trap catch for all doses tested compared to that of (7Z)-nonadecen-11-one alone. We recommend a blend of 300\u00a0\u00b5g of (7Z)-nonadecen-11-one and 300\u00a0\u00b5g of (7Z)-tricosene as an improved monitoring tool for raspberry bud moth for use by berry growers. This is the second report of the Z-alkene as a pheromone component in the Carposinidae family among the three carposisnid pheromones identified to date.",

    "abstract": "Rubus yellow net virus (RYNV) infects Rubus spp., causing a severe decline when present in mixed infections with other viruses. RYNV belongs to the family Caulimoviridae, also known as plant pararetroviruses, which can exist as episomal or integrated elements (endogenous). Most of integrated pararetroviruses are noninfectious; however, a few cases have been reported where they excised from the plant genome and formed infectious particles. Graft transmission onto indicator plants R. occidentalis \"Munger\" has been the standard test method for RYNV detection in certification programs. Previously, it was noticed that some RYNV PCR-positive plants did not induce symptoms on \"Munger\", suggesting an integration event. In this study, bio-indexing and different molecular techniques were employed to differentiate between integrated and episomal RYNV sequences. Reverse transcription-PCR using RYNV-specific oligonucleotides after DNase treatment generated positive results for the virus in graft transmissible isolates (episomal) only. To confirm these results, rolling circle amplification on DNA preparations from the same samples resulted in amplicons identified as RYNV only from plants with graft transmissible RYNV. High-throughput sequencing was used to identify the RYNV-like sequences present in the host DNA. These results indicate the integration of RYNV into the red raspberry genome and highlight the necessity to recognize this phenomenon (integration) in future Rubus quarantine and certification programs.",

    "abstract": "It is important to develop novel sensors for the simple, rapid, and quantitative detection of residual antibiotics in food, considering their potential threats to human health. Herein, we report the successful fabrication of raspberry-like nanogold (R-like Au) structures with rough surfaces and partially hollow structures for the rapid and sensitive detection of antibiotics in duck meats on a portable Raman spectrometer. The R-like Au with tunable plasmonic wavelengths was fabricated by a two-step method. Ag particles as seeds were substituted by Au particles through a replacement reaction; moreover, the surface plasmon resonances (SPRs) of R-like Au red-shifted with the increase in the Au ion concentration. The R-like Au with a diameter of about 120 nm that matched well with the 785 nm laser on the portable Raman spectrometer was used as an excellent surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) active platform for detecting two kinds of antibiotics, namely, nitrofurantoin (NFT) and nitrofurazone (NFZ), in spiked duck meats. Both of them have sufficient sensitivity (0.05-10 mg L-1), good linear relationship (R2 > 0.99) and high recovery in quantitative SERS analysis. The platform is simple without the need for complex pretreatment of the food samples or use of large scale Raman spectrometers, promising easy implementation for the on-site analysis of residuals of antibiotics in food.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural selection programmes are, today, working hard to obtain novel raspberry cultivars with higher nutritional and commercial quality. One of those cultivars is \"Adelita\". This study aims to provide novel tools for raspberry cultivar identification-more specifically, the differentiation of \"Adelita\" from other raspberry cultivars. To perform this study, five \"Adelita\" samples were analysed-four cultivated in Spain and one, in Morocco-and they were compared to seven samples from six raspberry cultivars (\"P04\", \"Lupita\", \"Enrosadira\", \"P10\", \"Quanza\" and \"Versalles\"). The physical parameters (mass, length, equatorial diameter and firmness) combined with the Total Phenolic Content (TPC); the antioxidant capacity according to the antioxidant activity tested with the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2,2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) methods; and the main target volatile compounds were used as independent variables. Principal component and cluster analysis showed that the target volatiles and physical parameters together with the TPC and DPPH values could be useful to classify Adelita cultivars separately from the rest of the cultivars included in the work. Those results proved that the developed methodology could be proposed as a reliable approach for the identification of cultivar fraud in the supply chain.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK; [4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone]) is used by the food and cosmetic industry as a flavoring agent. RK is also marketed as a dietary supplement for weight maintenance and appetite control. The purpose of the study was to characterize the acute feeding suppression with RK (64-640\u00a0mg/kg) by oral gavage in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Cumulative 24\u00a0h food intake was reduced at 200\u00a0mg/kg (24% feeding suppression) in males and reliably reduced at 640\u00a0mg/kg (49-77% feeding suppression). Feeding suppression was not associated with pica behavior over the range of doses or conditioned taste aversion. In a separate experiment, a single oral gavage of RK (640\u00a0mg/kg) resulted in approximate 43% mortality rate (6 out 14 male mice) within 2 days. Atrophy of white adipose tissue, splenic abnormalities, and thymus involution were noted after 2-4 days after oral gavage RK. Total white blood cell count, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils were significantly lower, while mean red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were significantly higher with RK treatment. Our findings indicated a dose-dependent feeding suppression with acute RK, but doses that reliable suppress food intake are associated with pathological changes.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK; [4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone]) is a popular nutraceutical used for weight management and appetite control. We sought to determine the physiological benefits of RK on the meal patterns and cardiovascular changes associated with an obesogenic diet. In addition, we explored whether the physiological benefits of RK promoted anxiety-related behaviors. Male and female C57BL/6J mice were administered a daily oral gavage of RK 200 mg/kg, RK 400 mg/kg, or vehicle for 14 days. Commencing with dosing, mice were placed on a high-fat diet (45% fat) or low-fat diet (10% fat). Our results indicated that RK 200 mg/kg had a differential influence on meal patterns in males and females. In contrast, RK 400 mg/kg reduced body weight gain, open-field total distance travelled, hemodynamic measures (i.e., reduced systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP and mean BP), and increased nocturnal satiety ratios in males and females. In addition, RK 400 mg/kg increased neural activation in the nucleus of the solitary tract, compared with vehicle. RK actions were not influenced by diet, nor resulted in an anxiety-like phenotype. Our findings suggest that RK has dose-differential feeding and cardiovascular actions, which needs consideration as it is used as a nutraceutical for weight control for obesity.",

    "abstract": "Alcoholic fermentation (AF) and malolactic fermentation (MLF) both have significant influence on the production of black raspberry wine. In this study, three microbes associated with AF and MLF including S. cerevisiae, T. delbrueckii and O. oeni were used to investigate their combined effect on basic compositional, volatile and sensory property of black raspberry wine, and four fermentation trials including single S. cerevisiae inoculation plus spontaneous MLF (BSU) and controlled MLF with O. oeni (BSO), sequential culture of T. delbrueckii and S. cerevisiae plus spontaneous MLF (BTSU) and controlled MLF (BTSO) were tested and compared. Fermentation results showed MLF in BSU, BSO and BTSO were successful, with respective period of 40, 25 and 23 days, whereas a stuck MLF occurred in BTSU. Volatile compounds were determined by HS-GC-IMS method, with a total of 45 aromas identified. BTSO was distinguished by a significant higher signal intensity of many fruity esters and a lower production of several alcohols and terpenes, which was in agreement with its perception result of strong 'fruity' and slight note of 'solvent' and 'herbaceous' during quantitative descriptive analysis. On the contrary, BSU was found to reinforce the synthesis of most detected volatiles, resulting in the enhancement of both beneficial and off-flavour compounds, therefore scoring lower in the 'global aroma' descriptor. Principal component analysis showed BSU and BSO were similar in the volatile composition, whereas BTSO was quite different. Overall, BTSO had greater potential to be used in the production of black raspberry wine.",

    "abstract": "Formulation of delivery systems for active ingredients is of increasing importance for the food industry. For that purpose, we selected cellulose as a carrier polymer of raspberry volatiles. Freeze-dried cellulose/raspberry complexes were prepared by complexation of raspberry juice (constant amount) and cellulose (2.5%, 5%, 7.5% and 10%). In our study, cellulose was shown as a good carrier of raspberry juice volatiles. Thirty-nine volatiles were detected in raspberry juice while 11 of them were lost during preparation of the complexes. Berry flavor note was the dominant one in raspberry juice (40% of overall flavor), followed by citrus and woody notes (each around 18% of overall flavor) and floral, fruity, and green (each around 8% of overall flavor). Cellulose/raspberry complexes had different flavor profiles, but a berry flavor note was still the dominant one in all complexes. These results suggest an efficient plant-based approach to produce value-added cellulose/volatile dry complexes with possible utility as food flavoring ingredients.",

    "abstract": "The male fruit fly attractants, cue-lure (CL) and raspberry ketone (RK), are important in pest management. These volatile phenylbutanoids occur in daciniphilous Bulbophyllum Thouar (Orchidaceae: Asparagales) orchids, along with zingerone (ZN) and anisyl acetone (AA). While these four compounds attract a similar range of species, their relative attractiveness to multiple species is unknown. We field tested these compounds in two fruit fly speciose locations in north Queensland, Australia (Lockhart and Cairns) for 8 wk. Of 16 species trapped in significant numbers, 14 were trapped with CL and RK, all in significantly greater numbers with CL traps than RK traps (at least in higher population locations). This included the pest species Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Diptera: Tephritidae) (CL catches ca. 5\u00d7 > RK), Bactrocera neohumeralis (Hardy) (Diptera: Tephritidae) and Bactrocera bryoniae (Tryon) (Diptera: Tephritidae) (CL catches ca. 3\u00d7 > RK), and Bactrocera frauenfeldi (Schiner) (Diptera: Tephritidae) (in Cairns-CL catches ca. 1.6\u00d7 > RK). Seven species were trapped with AA, and all were also caught in CL and RK traps in significantly greater numbers, with the exception of B. frauenfeldi. For this species, catches were not statistically different with CL, RK, and AA in Lockhart, and RK and AA in Cairns. Seven species were trapped with ZN, two at this lure only, and the remainder also with CL or RK but in significantly greater numbers. This is the first quantitative comparison of the relative attractiveness of CL, RK, AA, and ZN against multiple species, and supports the long-held but untested assumption that CL is broadly more attractive lure than RK.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry leaf blotch virus (RLBV) is the putative agent of the homonymous disease and even though Bosnia and Herzegovina is a major producer worldwide there is no report of the virus presence in the country. We studied the virus population structure and assessed its ability to move systemically. RLBV is widespread in production areas and has a homogeneous population structure; leading to the hypothesis that the primary mode of dissemination is propagation material. The ability of the virus to move systemically eliminates propagation of root cuttings as a viable option to obtain RLBV-free plants, leaving RT-PCR screening as the better option to propagate RLBV- free plants in the absence of clean-up facilities or certification programs in the country.",

Sixty adult male rats were divided randomly into group (I) control; group (II) rats received RK with dose (6\u2009mg/kg/day); Group III: rats received 5\u2009ml of WT extract/kg/day; Group IV rats received AA (5\u2009mg/kg/day); Group V: rats administrated with both AA (5\u2009mg/kg/day) and RK (6\u2009mg/kg/day) and Group VI: rats administrated AA (5\u2009mg/kg/day) and 5\u2009ml of WT extract/kg/day. The biochemical assays exhibited a significant increase in serum levels of Adiponectin, AST, ALT, ALP of the group treated with acrylamide if compared to the control group and an improvement in their levels of groups V and VI. The histopathological and immunohistochemical findings confirm the biochemical observations. In conclusion, the present investigation proved that the supplementation of WT and RK enhanced the liver histology, immunohistochemistry and biochemistry against the oxidative stress induced by acrylamide.",

    "abstract": "Rodents have been used for decades to probe neural circuits involved in behavior. Increasingly, attempts have been developed to standardize training paradigms across labs; and to use visual/auditory paradigms that can be also tested in humans. Commercially available systems are expensive and thus do not scale easily, and are not optimized for electrophysiology.\nUsing the rich open-source technology built around Raspberry Pi, we were able to develop an inexpensive (<$1000) visual-screen based operant chamber with electrophysiological and optogenetic compatibility. The chamber is operated within MATLAB/Simulink, a commonly used scientific programming language allowing for rapid customization.\nHere, we describe and provide all relevant details needed to develop and produce these chambers, and show examples of behavior and electrophysiology data collected using these chambers. We also include all of the tools needed to allow readers to build and develop their own boxes (CAD models for 3D printing and laser-cutting; PCB-board design; all bill of materials for required parts and supplies, and some examples of Simulink models to operate the boxes).\nThe new boxes are far more cost-effective than commercially available environments and allow for the combination of automated behavioral testing with electrophysiological read-outs with high temporal precision.\nThese open-source boxes can be used for labs interested in developing high-throughput visual/auditory behavioral assays for \u223c 10th the cost of commercial systems.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone (RK) (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone) is the major compound responsible for the characteristic aroma of red raspberries, and has long been used commercially as a flavoring agent and recently as a weight loss supplement. A targeted UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS method was developed and validated for analysis of RK and 25 associated metabolites in mouse plasma and brain. Dispersion and projection analysis and central composite design were used for method optimization. Random effect analysis of variance was applied for validation inference and variation partition. Within this framework, repeatability, a broader sense of precision, was calculated as fraction of accuracy variance, reflecting instrumental imprecision, compound degradation and carry-over effects. Multivariate correlation analysis and principle component analysis were conducted, revealing underlying association among the manifold of method traits. R programming was engaged in streamlined statistical analysis and data visualization. Two particular phenomena, the analytes' background existence in the enzyme solution used for phase II metabolites deconjugation, and the noted lability of analytes in pure solvent at 4 \u2103 vs. elevated stability in biomatrices, were found critical to method development and validation. The approach for the method development and validation provided a foundation for experiments that examine RK metabolism and bioavailability.",

    "abstract": "Herein, we report a novel lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) system for detecting cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in serum using the time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) technique and the fusion 5 membrane. The fusion 5 membrane is used as a strip for LFIA, and it is constructed without additional matrices (such as a sample or conjugation pad). Although this strategy for constructing the LFIA strip is quite simple and cost-effective, LFIA is still not suitable for the analysis of biomarkers that require high sensitivity, such as cTnI. Therefore, the highly sensitive TR-FRET technique is integrated with a fusion 5 membrane-based LFIA strip. To accomplish this, a microparticle covered with europium chelate-contained silica nanoparticles is synthesized as a raspberry-type particle and used as a fluorescence donor. A gold nanorod (GNR) is used as a fluorescence acceptor particle. In the TR-FRET-based LFIA system, the competitive immunoassay should be performed to satisfy the condition required for the FRET phenomenon to occur. Therefore, the fluorescence signal is proportional to the cTnI concentration, ensuring a quantitative analysis of cTnI can be accomplished by measuring the fluorescence signal between the raspberry-type europium particles and GNR. Using the developed TR-FRET-based LFIA system, sensitive detection of cTnI is successfully achieved with a limit of detection of 97\u00a0pg/mL in human serum. Moreover, because the result can be obtained using one matrix (the fusion 5 membrane), the developed LFIA system can be employed in cTnI diagnosis with a simple manufacturing process.",

    "abstract": "Among food producers, there is a need for and a great interest in obtaining powders from fruit and vegetables characterised by high nutritional values and sensory qualities at favourable prices, preferably lower than those for powders obtained by freeze-drying (FD). The present study assessed the functional properties, including bioactive ingredient contents, of the raspberry powders obtained by a new method of fluidised-bed jet milling and drying (FBJD) which has not been yet used on an industrial scale.\nCompared to the powders obtained by FD, the powders obtained by the new method were characterised by a comparable content of vitamin C (~2.70-2.74\u2009mg\u2009g\nConsidering the findings outlined above, the method tested is concluded to be competitive with the methods currently used as a result of the high content of bioactive compounds in powders obtained by means of the cheaper, low-temperature process of simultaneous drying and micronisation in FBJD. \u00a9 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to authenticate five types of Romanian honey (raspberry, rape, thyme, sunflower and mint) using a voltammetric tongue (VE tongue) technique. For the electronic tongue system, six electrodes (silver, gold, platinum, glass, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) were used. The results of the melissopalynological analysis were supplemented by the data obtained with the electronic voltammetric tongue system. The results were interpreted by means of principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). In this way, the usefulness of the working electrodes was compared for determining the botanical origin of the honey samples. The electrodes of titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and silver were more useful, as the results obtained with these electrodes showed that it was achieved a better classification of honey according to its botanical origin. The comparison of the results of the electronic voltammetric tongue technique with those obtained by melissopalynological analysis showed that the technique was able to accurately classify 92.7% of the original grouped cases. The similarity of results confirmed the ability of the electronic voltammetric tongue technique to perform a rapid characterization of honey samples, which complements its advantages of being an easy-to-use and cheap method of analysis.",

    "abstract": "The phenylbutanoid 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)butan-2-one, commonly known as raspberry ketone, is responsible for the typical scent and flavor of ripe raspberries. Chemical production of nature-identical raspberry ketone is well established as this compound is frequently used to flavor food, beverages and perfumes. However, high demand for natural raspberry ketone, but low natural abundance in raspberries, render raspberry ketone one of the most expensive natural flavoring components.\nIn this study, Corynebacterium glutamicum was engineered for the microbial synthesis of the character impact compound raspberry ketone from supplemented p-coumaric acid. In this context, the NADPH-dependent curcumin/dihydrocurcumin reductase CurA from Escherichia coli was employed to catalyze the final step of raspberry ketone synthesis as it provides a hitherto unknown benzalacetone reductase activity. In combination with a 4-coumarate: CoA ligase from parsley (Petroselinum crispum) and a monofunctional benzalacetone synthase from Chinese rhubarb (Rheum palmatum), CurA constitutes the synthetic pathway for raspberry ketone synthesis in C. glutamicum. The resulting strain accumulated up to 99.8\u00a0mg/L (0.61\u00a0mM) raspberry ketone. In addition, supplementation of other phenylpropanoids allowed for the synthesis of two other naturally-occurring and flavoring phenylbutanoids, zingerone (70\u00a0mg/L, 0.36\u00a0mM) and benzylacetone (10.5\u00a0mg/L, 0.07\u00a0mM).\nThe aromatic product portfolio of C. glutamicum was extended towards the synthesis of the flavoring phenylbutanoids raspberry ketone, zingerone and benzylacetone. Key to success was the identification of CurA from E. coli having a benzalacetone reductase activity. We believe, that the constructed C. glutamicum strain represents a versatile platform for the production of natural flavoring phenylbutanoids at larger scale.",

    "abstract": "Considering a growing demand for medicinal/cosmetic products with natural actives, this study focuses on the low-energy nanoemulsions (LE-NEs) prepared via the Phase inversion composition (PIC) method at room temperature as potential carriers for natural oil. Four different red raspberry seed oils (ROs) were tested, as follows: cold-pressed vs. CO2-extracted, organic vs. non-organic, refined vs. unrefined. The oil phase was optimized with Tocopheryl acetate and Isostearyl isostearate, while water phase was adjusted with either glycerol or an antioxidant hydro-glycolic extract. This study has used a combined approach to formulation development, employing both conventional methods (pseudo-ternary phase diagram - PTPD, electrical conductivity, particle size measurements, microscopical analysis, and rheological measurements) and the methods novel to this area, such as textural analysis and Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy has detected fine differences in chemical composition among ROs, and it detected the interactions within nanoemulsions. It was shown that the cold-pressed, unrefined, organic grade oil (RO2) with 6.62% saturated fatty acids and 92.25% unsaturated fatty acids, was optimal for the LE-NEs. Textural analysis confirmed the existence of cubic gel-like phase as a crucial step in the formation of stable RO2-loaded LE-NEs, with droplets in the narrow nano-range (125 to 135 nm; PDI \u2264 0.1). The DPPH test in methanol and ABTS in aqueous medium have revealed a synergistic free radical scavenging effect between lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidants in LE-NEs. The nanoemulsion carrier has improved the biological effect of raw materials on HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cells, while exhibiting good safety profile, as confirmed on MRC-5 normal human lung fibroblasts. Overall, this study has shown that low-energy nanoemulsions present very promising carriers for topical delivery of natural bioactives. Raman spectroscopy and textural analysis have proven to be a useful addition to the arsenal of methods used in the formulation and characterization of nanoemulsion systems.",

    "abstract": "Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of age-related functional decline and chronic diseases, which is primarily attributed to phytochemicals. Raspberries are rich in phytochemicals with a wide range of biological activities and health benefits. However, little is known about their effects on aging. The objective of this study was to determine whether raspberry extract (RE) could promote lifespan and stress resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), and to explore the underlying mechanisms of action. The results showed that the mean lifespan of C. elegans treated with RE at 20, 40 and 80 mg mL-1 was significantly increased by 13.6%, 22.9% and 29.7%, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. Supplementation with RE decreased the accumulation of lipofuscin and extended the healthspan of animals by improving motility and enhancing resistance to heat stress and UV-B radiation in C. elegans. Meanwhile, treatment with RE could regulate the expression of anti-aging related genes, including daf-2, age-1, akt-2, sir-2.1, daf-16, skn-1, jnk-1 and hsp-16.2, and promote the migration of DAF-16 into the nucleus. In addition, administration with RE abolished the extension of the lifespan of daf-2(e1370) mutants and RNAi (daf-16) C. elegans, and inhibited the expression of daf-16 downstream genes, including sod-3, ctl-2, dod17 and clk-1. In conclusion, RE could prolong the lifespan, improve the healthspan and enhance stress resistance in C. elegans by the insulin/IGF signaling pathway and DAF-16, providing a theoretical basis to fully exploit raspberry in the prevention of aging and healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Food allergies are a very serious problem among consumers. The most common food allergies involve animal products, but they can also involve fruits such as berries. We aimed to determine whether organic farming is useful for the production of high-quality and safe fruits. Three varieties of raspberries 'Laszka', 'Glen Ample' and 'Polka' from organic and conventional production (neighboring farms) were collected over the two years of the experiment. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of phenolic compounds was carried out, and the content of Bet v1 and profilin was determined. The organic raspberries contained a lower level of phenolic compounds, especially anthocyanins. Conventional fruits were characterized by a higher allergenic potency than organic ones. We found a strong link between their anthocyanin content and the allergy status of conventional raspberry fruits. Therefore, organically produced raspberries are safer for consumers.",

    "abstract": "We report a facile method for preparation of polystyrene (PS) particles with spherical, raspberry-like, and hollow flower-like structures by single-step non-surfactant self-templating polymerization of styrene in ethanol-water mixtures. PS particles with diverse morphologies could be easily obtained by simply adjusting the volume ratios of the styrene/water/ethanol mixture and initiator-ethanol-water mixture. By decreasing this ratio, the particles with spherical, raspberry-like, and hollow flower-like structures were obtained in sequence. The wettability of the coatings changing from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity was easily tuned by the PS particles with different roughnesses. A competitive mechanism of interfacial polymerization and exudation was proposed to interpret the formation of PS particles with diverse morphologies.",

    "abstract": "Black raspberry (BRB) phytochemicals demonstrate anti-carcinogenic properties in experimental models, including prostate cancer. Two BRB foods, a confection and nectar, providing a consistent and reproducible product for human clinical studies are designed and characterized.\nMen with clinically localized prostate cancer are sequentially enrolled to a control group or one of four intervention groups (confection or nectar, 10 or 20 g dose; n = 8 per group) for 4 weeks prior to prostatectomy. Primary outcomes include: safety, adherence, and ellagitannin metabolism. Adherence to the intervention is >96%. No significant (\u2265grade II) toxicities are detected. Urinary urolithins (A, B, C, and D) and dimethyl ellagic acid (DMEA) quantified by Ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (UPLC/MS/MS) indicate a dose-dependent excretion yet heterogeneous patterns among men. Men in the BRB confection groups have greater urinary excretion of the microbial urinary metabolites urolithin A and DMEA, suggesting that this food matrix provides greater colonic microflora exposure.\nFully characterized BRB confections and nectar are ideal for food-based large phase III human clinical studies. BRB products provide a bioavailable source of BRB phytochemicals, however large inter individual variation in polyphenol metabolism suggests that host genetics, microflora, and other factors are critical to understanding bioactivity and metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the incidence of lifestyle diseases is increasing due to inappropriate nutrition and environmental pollution. To prevent these diseases, various groups of bioactive compounds are needed with a broad spectrum of action and without adverse side effects. Polyphenolic compounds are the most widely studied group of this type of compounds. They occur widely in plants, but their content depends on many factors, including the type of plant, climatic conditions, and the date of harvest. The spectrum of bioactivity of phenolic compounds is determined by their chemical structure, concentration, and interaction with other compounds. Traditional recipes have been studied to search for active plant ingredients. Leaves of shrubs and fruit trees were used in folk medicine as a panacea for many diseases and have been forgotten with time, but their benefits are now being rediscovered. In recent years, much new information about biological activity of phenolic compounds from berry bushes (black currant, raspberry, and aronia) was published. This was reviewed and discussed in this article. The mineral content of their leaves was also summarized because minerals constitute a significant component of plant infusions. It has been shown that high antioxidant and biological activity of leaf extracts results from the presence of active phenolic compounds, which occur in definitely higher amounts than in fruits. Therefore, the leaves of berry bushes seem to be a promising source of substances that can be used as replacements for synthetic agents in the treatment and prevention of lifestyle diseases.",

High processing temperature reduced ascorbic acid, total monomeric anthocyanins (TMA) and total phenolics (TP) in strawberries (p<0.05), but not in raspberries. Processing temperature had minor effect on bioactive compounds in the jams during storage (<10% explained variance), but influenced color (L*, \u00b0Hue, Chroma), especially L* of the strawberry jams (73.3%). Storage period explained most of the variance in ascorbic acid (>90%), TMA (>42%) and TP (>69%). Storage temperature affected stability of anthocyanins, but had minor effect on ascorbic acid, which declined rapidly independent of storage temperature. Storage temperature also explained most of the variance (>40%) in Chroma of the jams and L* of raspberry jams (53%).

    "abstract": "Knowledge about the interior and exterior camera orientation parameters is required to establish the relationship between 2D image content and 3D object data. Camera calibration is used to determine the interior orientation parameters, which are valid as long as the camera remains stable. However, information about the temporal stability of low-cost cameras due to the physical impact of temperature changes, such as those in smartphones, is still missing. This study investigates on the one hand the influence of heat dissipating smartphone components at the geometric integrity of implemented cameras and on the other hand the impact of ambient temperature changes at the geometry of uncoupled low-cost cameras considering a Raspberry Pi camera module that is exposed to controlled thermal radiation changes. If these impacts are neglected, transferring image measurements into object space will lead to wrong measurements due to high correlations between temperature and camera's geometric stability. Monte-Carlo simulation is used to simulate temperature-related variations of the interior orientation parameters to assess the extent of potential errors in the 3D data ranging from a few millimetres up to five centimetres on a target in X- and Y- direction. The target is positioned at a distance of 10 m to the camera and the Z-axis is aligned with camera's depth direction.",

    "abstract": "Skin aging has many manifestations such as wrinkles, uneven skin tone, and dryness. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, especially ultraviolet light-induced oxidative radicals, contribute to the etiology of aging. Human skin requires both water- and lipid-soluble nutrient components, including hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants. Vitamins C and E have important protective effects in the aging process and require exogenous supply. Raspberry leaf extracts contain botanical actives that have the potential to hydrating and moisturizing skin. Topical products with these ingredients may therefore combine to provide improved anti-aging effects over single ingredients.\nTo evaluate the anti-aging and brightening effects of an encapsulated serum containing vitamin C (20% w/w), vitamin E, and European raspberry (Rubus idaeus) leaf cell culture extract.\nFifty female volunteers aged 30-65\u00a0years were allocated one capsule of serum for topical application on one side of the face for 2\u00a0months, in addition to self-use of facial skin products. Both test (treated) and contralateral (untreated) sides were dermatologically assessed after 4 and 8\u00a0weeks. Skin color (melanin index), elasticity, radiance, moisture, and water evaporation were measured by Mexameter MX18\nSkin color, elasticity, and radiance were significantly improved. The smoothness, scaliness, and wrinkles were also revealed significant improvement. Mild adverse reactions were tingling and tightness.\nThe vitamin C, vitamin E, and raspberry leaf cell culture extract serum has anti-aging and brightening effects of skin.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ringspot virus (RpRSV) is an important virus that infects horticultural crops including grapevine, cherry, berry fruit and rose. The genome sequences of RpRSV are highly diverse between isolates and this makes the design of a PCR-based detection method difficult. In this study, a TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay was developed for the rapid and sensitive detection of RpRSV. Primers and probes targeting the most conserved region of the movement protein gene were designed to amplify a 229 bp fragment of RpRSV RNA-2. The assay was able to amplify all RpRSV isolates tested. The detection limit of the RpRSV target region was estimated to be 61-98 copies, depending on the RpRSV strain. The sensitivity was about 100 times greater than the conventional RT-PCR assay using the same primers as the real-time RT-PCR assay. A comparison with published conventional RT-PCR assays indicated that both published assays lacked reliability and sensitivity, as neither were able to amplify all RpRSV isolates tested, and both were at least 1000 times less sensitive than the novel TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay. The assay can also be run as a duplex reaction with the nad5 plant internal control primers and probe to simultaneously verify the PCR competency of the samples. The amplicon obtained with the real-time RT-PCR assay is suitable for direct sequencing if it is necessary to further confirm the RpRSV identity or determine the RpRSV strain.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal pollen transmission by the raspberry bushy dwarf virus 1b deletion mutant (RB\u03941bstop), which is defective in virus virulence, was significantly decreased compared to wild-type raspberry bushy dwarf virus (wtRBDV). We assessed accumulation of viral genomic (g) RNAs in pollen grains from RB\u03941bstop-infected plants and found that the pollen grains had less viral gRNA than those from wtRBDV-infected plants. In addition, pollen grains from 1b-expressing transgenic plants (1b-plants) infected with RB\u03941bstop were more efficient in horizontal virus transmission to healthy plants after pollination than pollen from RB\u03941bstop-infected wild type plants. Moreover, viral gRNA accumulation in pollen grains from RB\u03941bstop-infected 1b-plants was higher than in pollen from RB\u03941bstop-infected wild type plants. We suggest that 1b increases the amount of viral gRNAs released from elongating pollen grains.",

    "abstract": "Torulaspora delbrueckii is a widely studied non-Saccharomyces yeast, described as having a positive impact on the organoleptic quality of wines, however, little is known about its impact on the production of raspberry wine. In this study, we compared combined use of S. cerevisiae/T. delbrueckii pair, i.e., in sequential inoculation (RT) and co-fermentation (RC) modes, with spontaneous fermentation (RU) and single S. cerevisiae inoculation (RS), on various properties of raspberry wine including fermentation behaviors (using yeast counts and next-generation sequencing method), basic composition (by OIV, 2019), volatile profile (using headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry), sensory property (by quantitative descriptive analyses) and biogenic amine levels. All the alcoholic fermentations were completed within 9\u00a0days; T. delbrueckii was inhibited by S. cerevisiae in the co-culture; and Saccharomyces and Mrakia were the most abundant species in RU. A total of 40 aromas was identified, with RT abundant in volatile esters, ketones and terpenes and others showing relatively lower intensities. During sensory evaluation, RT was characterized by 'fruity' and 'sweet' notes; RC was notable for a high 'floral' attribute; RU scored the highest in 'pungent' and RS showed intermedium intensities for most descriptors. Partial least squares regression showed the relationship between aromas and sensory descriptors. As for biogenic amine, RU contained the highest total amount and RS had the least. Overall, RT had greater potential to be used in the production of raspberry wine.",

    "abstract": "This study involves microencapsulation of anthocyanin extract (AC) from red raspberry using a freeze drying technique involving ultrasonication of soy protein isolate (SPI), gum arabic (AG), and their combination. Analyses included microcapsule properties, encapsulation efficiency, antioxidant capacity using the DPPH assay, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), color, thermal stability, stability during storage, morphology, and simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Encapsulation efficiency (EE) ranged from 93.05% to 98.87% for all microcapsules. The morphology of microcapsules by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated a broken glass shape, with mean size of microcapsules ranging from 21.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.71\u00a0\u03bcm to 48.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.33\u00a0\u03bcm using Mastersizer analyzer. A good relationship obtained between zeta potential (ZP) and FTIR spectrum indicated that there is a chemical cross linking interaction between wall material and core material. All microcapsules enhanced the thermal stability of AC in the temperature range 80-114\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, AC retention (up to 48%) during storage at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 60\u00a0days revealed that treatment H combination of SPI and AG was best. In addition, SPI and AG combination presented good release behavior under simulated gastrointestinal conditions compared with unencapsulated anthocyanin.",

    "abstract": "Automatic decision support systems have gained importance in health sector in recent years. In parallel with recent developments in the fields of artificial intelligence and image processing, embedded systems are also used in decision support systems for tumor diagnosis. Extreme learning machine (ELM), is a recently developed, quick and efficient algorithm which can quickly and flawlessly diagnose tumors using machine learning techniques. Similarly, significantly fast and robust fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm (FRFCM) is a novel and fast algorithm which can display a high performance. In the present study, a brain tumor segmentation approach is proposed based on extreme learning machine and significantly fast and robust fuzzy C-means clustering algorithms (BTS-ELM-FRFCM) running on Raspberry Pi (PRI) hardware. The present study mainly aims to introduce a new segmentation system hardware containing new algorithms and offering a high level of accuracy the health sector. PRI's are useful mobile devices due to their cost-effectiveness and satisfying hardware. 3200 training images were used to train ELM in the present study. 20 pieces of MRI images were used for testing process. Figure of merid (FOM), Jaccard similarity coefficient (JSC) and Dice indexes were used in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. In addition, the proposed method was compared with brain tumor segmentation based on support vector machine (BTS-SVM), brain tumor segmentation based on fuzzy C-means (BTS-FCM) and brain tumor segmentation based on self-organizing maps and k-means (BTS-SOM). The statistical analysis on FOM, JSC and Dice results obtained using four different approaches indicated that BTS-ELM-FRFCM displayed the highest performance. Thus, it can be concluded that the embedded system designed in the present study can perform brain tumor segmentation with a high accuracy rate.",

    "abstract": "The authors aim to investigate the mechanisms by which red raspberry (RR) polyphenolic fractions regulate obesity and inflammation with an emphasis on the crosstalk between adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) and adipocyte progenitors.\nC57BL/6 male mice are fed either a high-fat (HF) diet or an HF diet supplemented with a RR polyphenolic fraction from whole fruit, pulp, or seed. Supplementation with pulp significantly increases energy expenditure and reduces HF-diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. The pulp, and to a lesser extent, whole polyphenols, decreases the recruitment of ATM, activation of the nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, and adipocyte hypertrophy, which is associated with epigenetic modulation of adipogenesis (e.g., H3K27Ac, H3K9Ac). Results from an IL-1\u03b2 reporter assay in J774 macrophages recapitulate the inhibitory role of RR polyphenols on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Using conditioned media from macrophages, it is demonstrated that RR polyphenols reverse the IL-1\u03b2-mediated epigenetic suppression of H3K27Ac in adipocyte progenitor cells.\nRR polyphenols from pulp and whole fruit serve as an inhibitor for NLRP3 inflammasome activation and an epigenetic modifier to regulate adipogenesis, which confers resistance against diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "It is reported that black raspberry (BRB) anthocyanins could act as a potential chemopreventive agent for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the underlying mechanism by which BRB anthocyanins inhibits the carcinogenesis of CRC cells has not been elucidated. The abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) that target important tumor suppressor genes is usually associated with CRC development. In this study, we explored whether BRB anthocyanins could affect the expression of certain miRNAs in an azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced CRC mouse model and human CRC cell lines. miRNA microarray analysis was used to determine the differences in miRNA expression between AOM/DSS-induced mice fed with a diet supplemented without or with BRB anthocyanins. The expression of one particular miRNA, miR-483-3p, was found to decrease dramatically in AOM/DSS-induced mice that were fed with a diet supplemented with BRB anthocyanins. Subsequent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses showed that the reduced expression of miR-483-3p was accompanied by an increased expression of Dickkopf 3 (DKK3), a potential target of miR-483-3p as predicted by bioinformatic analysis. The protein and messenger RNA levels of DKK3 were significantly upregulated when the miR-483-3p level was reduced by a miR-483-3p-specific inhibitor, suggesting that DKK3 might be the target gene of miR-483-3p. In addition, the downstream factors of the DKK3 signaling pathway, which included Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, also played a role in the miR-483-3p-mediated anticancer effect of BRB anthocyanins. Thus, miR-483-3p might be a potential target in BRB anthocyanin-mediated prevention of CRC.",

    "abstract": "Raspberry ketone is a primary aroma component of the red raspberry. The glycosylation of this compound is a potential approach used to improve its pharmaceutical properties. In this work, raspberry ketone glycosides are produced in bacteria for the first time. Bacillus licheniformis PI15, an organic solvent-tolerant glycosyltransferase-producing strain, was isolated from chemically polluted soil. The cloning and heterologous expression of a glycosyltransferase, which was designated PI-GT1, in Escherichia coli BL21 resulted in the expression of an active and soluble protein that accounted for 15% of the total cell protein content. Purified PI-GT1 was highly active and stable over a broad pH range (6.0-10.0) and showed excellent pH stability. PI-GT1 maintained almost 60% of its maximal activity after 3\u00a0H of incubation at 20-40\u00a0\u00b0C and demonstrated optimal activity at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. Additionally, PI-GT1 displayed high stability and activity in the presence of hydrophilic solvents with log P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0-0.2 and retained more than 80% of its activity after 3\u00a0H of treatment. Supplementation with 10% DMSO markedly improved the glycosylation of raspberry ketone, resulting in a value 26 times higher than that in aqueous solution. The organic solvent-tolerant PI-GT1 may have potential uses in industrial chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis applications.",

    "abstract": "In 2018, an outbreak of leptospirosis was identified among raspberry workers from a mixed-berry farm in New South Wales, Australia. Initial testing had not revealed a cause, but eventually leptospirosis was detected via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Further serological testing detected Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Arborea, of which rodents are the predominant reservoir. Leptospirosis is rare in Australia, with outbreaks usually related to flooding. We conducted an investigation to identify risk factors for infection, to inform control measures.\nCases were detected through laboratory notifications, hospital-based syndromic surveillance, awareness-raising among farm employees and clinician alerts. Confirmed cases had a four-fold rise in antibody titre or single titre \u2265400 on microscopic agglutination test, and a positive IgM. Probable cases had a positive Leptospira PCR or IgM, and possible cases had a clinically compatible illness. We conducted a case-control study among raspberry workers on the farm and compared reported exposures between cases and seronegative controls. We assessed environmental risks on-site and tested rodents for leptospirosis.\nWe identified 84 cases over a 5-month period (50 confirmed, 19 probable and 15 possible). Compared with controls, cases were less likely to wear gloves and more recently employed. Cases also more commonly reported always having scratched hands, likely from the thorns on raspberry plants. We observed evidence of rodent activity around raspberry plants and three of thirteen trapped mice tested positive for Leptospira Arborea. Control measures included enhanced glove use, doxycycline prophylaxis and rodent control.\nThis is the largest known outbreak of leptospirosis in Australia. Workers were likely exposed through scratches inflicted during harvesting, which became contaminated with environmental leptospires from mice. Leptospirosis should be considered an occupational risk for raspberry workers, requiring protective measures. Chemoprophylaxis may assist in controlling outbreaks. PCR assists in the early diagnosis and detection of leptospirosis and should be included in surveillance case definitions.",

    "abstract": "Research has shown that berries may have the ability to reverse, reduce, or slow the progression of behavioral dysfunction associated with aging and neurodegenerative disease. In contrast, high-energy and high-fat diets (HFD) may result in behavioral deficits like those seen in aging animals. This research examined whether red raspberry (\nEight-week-old mice consumed a HFD (60% calories from fat) or a control diet (CD) with and without 4% freeze-dried red raspberry (RB). Behavioral tests and biochemical assays of brain tissue and serum were conducted.\nAfter 12 weeks on the diets, mice fed CD and HFD had impaired novel object recognition, but mice on the RB-supplemented diets did not. After approximately 20 weeks on the diets, mice fed HFD\u2009+\u2009RB had shorter latencies to find the escape hole in the Barnes maze than the HFD-fed mice. Interleukin (IL)-6 was significantly elevated in the cortex of mice fed HFD; while mice fed the CD, CD\u2009+\u2009RB, and HFD\u2009+\u2009RB did not show a similar elevation. There was also evidence of increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brains of mice fed RB diets. This reduction in IL-6 and increase in BDNF may contribute to the preservation of learning and memory in HFD\u2009+\u2009RB mice.\nThis study demonstrates that RB may protect against the effects HFD has on brain and behavior; however, further research with human subjects is needed to confirm these benefits.",
